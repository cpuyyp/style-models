After the fit, accessories and contact points, I think that wheels are the most important piece of hardware. Unfortunately it's usually the most expensive upgrade save a new group set. Im going to disclude saddle and pedals because they're givens and they need to be comfortable so that expense is unavoidable and not necessarily and upgrade. Good wheels are usually a nice upgrade, can last many years, can often be transferred from bike to bike and make a noticeable difference in ride. Then I'd say good rubber to put on those wheels is money well spent. And maybe a good pair of fenders depending your local climate. 

I noticed this as well. In my experience, on higher end road bikes, the cassette that you put on the freehub body makes the most audible difference, versus the actual inner-workings of the freehub itself in most cases, i.e. normal, ratchet style freehub body. Example: I went from a Sram PG-1130 cassette to a PG-1170 recently. The lower end cassette (1130) construction is different, specifically the dome and spacers (which are plastic). On the higher end cassette (1170) the dome is lighter and stiffer, and the spacers are steel and attached to the cogs. The cassette acts like an amplifier for the sounds coming from the freehub. Thus, a cassette like the aforementioned 1170, with a very resonant dome and body, casts way more sound than the 1130, which is expected as it has plastic construction with deadens the sound considerably and a thicker dome, which also hinders resonance. I noticed immediately after the switch that the sound coming from my bike went from: 

I've done the same thing in the past, heel shims, cleat wedges, pedal washers, insoles, etc. The one thing I can say is that it's a slippery slope once you start fiddling with these things. One small adjustment effects all the others and it's very difficult and time consuming to get it right, which you probably never will without 3rd party perspective and expertise. No to mention there are a bunch of other things that can be causing your pain besides leg length difference; fore/aft foot tilt, knee alignment, saddle position, etc. The real solution is to get a professional bike fitting. 

During the 2017 TdF one of the commentators said the that a teams GC contender or their best rider always has their spare bike carried on the right side of the team car, on the roof, above the team mechanic. This was surprising and I'm wondering why the top rider's bike has a special place. Is it just because it's fastest to grab a bike thats directly above oneself in the case of a mechanical failure or are there other reasons as well? 

I've seen time trail racers do the opposite and run a 22mm or 23mm tire in back and a 25mm up front. One reason not to have a larger tire in back is because it's comparatively heavier and all the extra weight is around the circumference of the wheel. When you are putting power through the crank and trying to spin up the rear wheel, that extra weight is felt and you need more power compared to the effort required when riding a lighter, possibly smaller tire. One other reason I can think of is that it might actually be more aero to have a larger tire up front when paired with a wide rim, which is the current industry trend. Every wheel manufacturer seems to find evidence that whatever they are doing is the best. 

You most certainly can use a PTFE spray after cleaning, but, I would use a high quality chain lube instead. I use this dry teflon lube on my drivetrain and use a precision applicator to lube my derailleurs after I clean the drivetrain. Personally, I wouldn't use any WD40 branded lubricant on my bike. Also, I'd recommend not using a spray type applicator to apply lubricant on small parts. I like to use the precision applicator, i.e. the long, skinny straw, to be able to reach into all the pivots of the derailleurs and accurately apply the lube. The spray can be messy and will often contaminate other parts of your bike, like rotors or brake tracks on your wheels. The 'Dry' lube is nice because it doesn't pick up that much road grime in the derailleurs. 

They also mention reduction of unsprung weight as one of the biggest advantages, as well as reduction in side-loading as another advantage. The only disadvantages I've read about are the aforementioned oil leakage issue and a possibility of greater change of nicks on the stanchion from road debris. Are these valid concerns on a bicycle? Are there any other pros/cons to an USD suspension setup on a bicycle? 

As some have pointed out in the comments, the question is somewhat misleading, i.e. speed difference is always going to be greater in a head on collision, all things being equal, versus if the collision had been a rear ended collision or a t-bone, but, as @Daniel notes: 

Is it possible to install a Campagnolo Record 11 speed mechanical rear derailleur on a bike that is otherwise equipped with a Sram Force 11 speed groupset? Has anyone ever used a similar setup and if so, how did it shift? Were there any problems in mixing the two brands? 

And this is what it looks like dried, on a synthetic fiber of a torn winter boot, for some context. It's somewhat like a pliable rubber cement. It smells extremely strong and volatile, ventilation is necessary. It dries within a couple hours. I'd recommend it. I got a large tube for about 5 dollars on Amazon. I have no affiliation with the company. Happy gluing. 

I think that regardless of the higher or lower rolling resistance, you will feel the extra weight of the 60mm tire as you accelerate, or the lighter weight of the 40mm, however you look at it. There is more mass around the circumference of the wheel with a 60mm tire, and that will have to be overcome to accelerate (think turning too), which may give you the "sluggish" feel, relative to a smaller, lighter 40mm tire. 

While this may be a terse answer, the company Bont makes fully custom shoes with moldable carbon footbeds, or "tubs". The standard shoe has a removable heel protector which would allow you to drill and mount directly to the heel. Going the full custom route (~$1000 US vs $400) they could make you a shoe with a completely flat mold on the heel, I believe. Their tooling may restrict this but based on the bonts I own (vapour +), I don't see why a full custom couldn't be made with the heel you describe. This still leaves you with the problem of mounting and placement. As others have said, a sports physiologist would be a good idea if you are going to put a lot of money into this. If you place that cleat wrong on your heel I'm guessing it won't be good for your knee/back/posterior chain. Also I have no affiliation with the aforementioned company.
