The ship had a critical failure somewhere in the solar system. A vast majority of the on board population was lost to this. The minimum crew is awaken by the ship, they initiate contact with humanity as they need help (manpower and resources). They are generally peaceful but the ship is capable of significant defense. This because if they are not peaceful we are easy pray and if they cant defend at all then they are easy pray and on both cases no standoff for intrigue can be made. You can have a plot conflict between humans who want to help them and cooperate and humans who just want to capture the ship, kill them and take the technology. Sub-plot intrigues can be made with the timing of discovering certain elements, like how many are left, how good the defense is, how opened they are to communication etc. Evolve the story into something where the ship is rebuild, some sort of technological transfer is made, humans join them, maybe in an extended and rebuilt ship that would properly sustain both populations. you can have a sequel with the voyage to the other world and stuff like that. 

Genghis Khan's tomb has not been found. He requested that, so they made a deep hole, placed him in then put back the ground, didn't put any sign and story says that they went with their horses in every direction, trampled earth both while going to the dig site and after finishing the burial going away. And did that so randomly that after time passed it was impossible to trace them back. If you want to keep something hidden, don't put signs saying "don't open this", put it somewhere no one can find it. It is generally a Hollywood go to stupid plot this thing of "warnings from the ancients". When people want to hide something or keep it away, they do just that, they don't make it easy to find and then write "don't look inside". So my question is: is it so important for your plot to have them write something there and so perpetuate a stupid stereotype or you can concentrate your story on the actual building of the tomb and on its secrecy? Because if you don't concentrate on writing useless stuff, you can make it simple by creating a stone prison and then bringing mud and dirt and planting trees and so creating a "natural" looking hill. Like the Chinese did with their pyramids, but in your case it would be an intentionally forgotten, never spoken about place. And the release of this ancient evil can be done by accident (your present time civilization can dig a tunnel there for a highway or whatever). 

One specific idea - separate breathing from eating. As humans we have to stop breathing for a moment to drink or swallow. Evolutionarily-speaking, its probably to make the best use of a complex system of the mouth for speaking as well as chewing rather than duplicating things. If the beings had separate eating orifaces from their breathing ones, then efficiency rises and multitasking becomes more possible. Downside, the human nose depends on air movement to smell things, and having no air movement there would impact on the sense of taste. On the positive side, there's zero danger of choking on food, or inhaling vomit into the lungs because of the partitioning of systems. 

Another take - ohana meaning family. "The concept emphasises that families are bound together and members must cooperate and remember one another." In relation to this pantheon of gods, is exactly like Uncle Bob and Aunty Moaner. At a family gathering you may be annoyed by constant hugs from one, but you still have to tolerate it because the other is your favourite. 

We're all adults here... so what age group is your story targetted at? Jim might be boring at home, but if missionaries haven't been invented then that's new and exotic. Also there's a size differential as suggested by @Korthalion which may be proportional. Even just same-but-different a way of freshening the blood leading to genetic variety over the subsequent generations. Many cultures recognise the dangers of inbreeding in isolated groups and could value Jim just for that. 

Answer: the Oxygen molecule O3, known as Ozone. I live in New Zealand and between us and the Australians we have a high level of UV compared to other places in the world. I get sunburned through my clothes, and I can get sunburned on a cloudy day. Some of this is because of the Ozone hole over the antarctic, allowing more ulta-violet in sunlight to come though. So your planet could have a naturally higher level of ozone, or could be actively adding ozone to the atmosphere somehow. Perhaps there are a lot of shorelines, because Ozone is generated by wave action. Or a heap of electrical activity, again oxygen is converted to ozone in proximity of electrical discharges. Ozone is damaged by chloroflorocarbons, aka CFCs, that were used in spray cans for years, as well as refrigerents like Freon and fire suppressent like Halon. Your planet should never have any of this. Links: 

I don't know about anything else, but you would need genetic engineers to modify the humans that land there. Radius twice the size of earth would mean a mass tens of times bigger then Earths (I am to lazy to calculate now), and a gravitational acceleration significantly bigger than Earths. Also, the atmosphere would be very thick, people could not breathe that air. Actually I think that at this mass, the planet would be to heavy to be considered a rocky planet, and it would be a gas giant (a little on at that). As such, the humans could not survive there. But if it would not be a gas giant, if they would first go to the moon, set up there, build up a larger colony and then they would genetically alter themselves they could go on the planet next. So for this genetic manipulation you would need genetic engineers. And there is another problem. Normally you would send a ship with a lot of resources first if you go a short distance like to Mars, then a colony ship with only what is needed for traveling safely. This because you can wait to see that the first ship got there safe, the load was not damaged and the people have the equipment. If it fails you just send another ship with equipment. That way you don't risk the lives of the people with some extra heavy ship in one round. This is what happens with the ISS now, we don't send extra heavy rockets with all that the astronauts would need for the entire period with them, there is a stash there and it is constantly replenished by unmanned missions (which are safer in term of potential human loss). This makes your scenario more improbable, as the ship would not carry enough equipment. You would send such a complete ship only if it goes a long distance (to another system). 

Pay your guards very well, so much so that significant bribes are insufficient to make them risk a long and valuable income stream as their regular job. Make the guards a corps, rather than just employment. Care for your guards - feed them, arm/equip them well with current arms and armour. Care for their families - any guard injured or killed and their spouse is covered for life, and children till age of maturity. 

In "Red/Green/Blue Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson, $URL$ the martian colonists offer services so a form of barter. But one of the services is to increase the local oxygen level of the atmosphere by some (small) amount. This is seen as a promise to do a community service, and might be perceived as a kind of "local sales tax" paid to the planet. This would be open to abuse, in the form of All Take, No Give. So your currency comes from having a visible or measurable level of honour or truthfulness which is reflected in the flavour / colour / spin / taste of their mana / aura / magic. So I give you a week's bread, you promise to spend 2 hours gardening and cleaning up the local kid's playground because you know my kids play there. You do it, everything is good. If you don't, you "smell" bad and I can sense that, and won't trust your promise next time. 

Candles Jim could use fat from a kill, heat it with stones from the fire till it runs, and pour it into a hollowed out bone "end" or raw mud pottery cup. Even a shell of an orange or a hollowed out root vegetable or tree nut shell would do. Suspend a wick in the liquid, perhaps a few strands of cotton cloth from his clothes, and once the fat has cooled and solidified then its a candle. Maybe keeping the source of the wicks secret is his way of stopping others from duplicating his candles. Further info $URL$
