You can ease into this pose gradually. I suggest 3-4 minutes on each side for a good and deep stretch, releasing the tension of the connective tissue and the muscle. This can also be done daily. To summarize Strengthen the hamstring and butt. Take small breaks often during a day of sitting. Stretch the hip flexors whenever possible, preferably several times per day. On the whole, I'd suggest taking some beginner yoga classes, as you will get familiarized with a good stretching routine, which will really make a difference in the long run. 

Swimming. There's always swimming. It's easy on joints and bones, and is both a cardiovascular exercise, and a strength exercise. Other than that, you're going to have to look to your diet to lose weight. Remember, weight loss happens when over time, your consumed calories amount to less than your spent calories. 

EDIT: After a pretty rewarding chat, I think what you're experiencing is a deload, which fits pretty well with the idea of momentum. A deload is where we take a bit of a break from training, whereby we either train very lightly, or not at all, in order to give our bodies complete restitution. It's pretty much like a vacation, because it allows for some time off in order to come back stronger and feeling better. We use deloads specifically to destroy plateaus, because having an indefinite linear progression is physically impossible. Taking a step back and really letting your muscles and CNS get back to 100% helps prevent stagnation. And best of all, when you come back to the gym, you'll find that not much strength has been lost. Within maybe a week or two, you'll be back where you left off, but with more energy to spare. That might be why it seems like you're carrying momentum from before your break. Although the article I linked presents a deload typically as a one-week thing, I've had the same effect from taking as much as two months off, although I wouldn't make it that long unless I had to (work, vacation, other circumstances). 

Which order you do these exercises in has little bearing on this. Just switch it around whenever you feel like you've plateau'd. 

Pain If you have possible injuries, you should absolutely consult a doctor, and not the internet. You will quite probably need a scan of some sort. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say you've pulled a muscle, or possibly torn a tendon/ligament, depending on the intensity of the pain. 60 bridges sounds like a possible cause here. Oh, and about those bridges... Leg day What I can tell you for sure though, is that your leg exercises are quite poorly laid out. Bridges work well for glutes as an isolation exercise, but it does virtually nothing for your legs. And leg raises is an abdominal exercise. This does nothing at all for your legs. For legs, you should look into various squatting techniques. There is plenty to be done with bodyweight alone. Here is a list of 40 different variations. You absolutely do NOT need to do all of these every time, but pick 3-4 of them each time you have leg day. If you need more advice on setting up an at-home exercise plan, you can add another question. 

No, this is false. You have to understand that when you gain fat, you gain it in all fat deposits on the body. It doesn't fill one deposit first, then move on to another. And on the other side of the coin, the same applies when you lose fat. Now, some fat deposits are larger than others, and more fat will be directed there. That's why you have more fat on your belly than on your arms, for instance. But still, when you gain/lose fat, it will be gained/lost from all deposits. Just in different amounts. 

EDIT: Since "fit" is a very arbitrary term, I should include my definition, since the asker did not. From the starting point of a 50kg man, I consider fit to include 

I'd give it some credit, and say that planking on a vibrating surface will have some extra yield, since you have to activate more core muscles to keep stability. That said, the Power Plate is NOT worth paying for. It's a niche product, and whatever benefit it does give, can be offered by conventional equipment found in any gym. 

Thoracic flexion is absolutely something you should work on improving, so first of all, kudos on the self-analysis. It is indeed a problem that arises when you lift weights closer to your max, and it's simply caused by the fact that the muscles used to maintain thoracic extension, aren't as strong as the combined strength of the muscles used to actually perform the lift. Thankfully, there's assistance work to help you get these lower back muscles up to scratch, like back raises, straight-leg deadlifts, and a sleugh of others. But with that said, it should be noted that the weight at which people do 5 reps per set, is on the high end on the spectrum. If you can do 5x5 at 110kg, then you can probably do 3x8 at 95-100kg, and if you can do that with better form, then that's one way to actually work on your form too. When it comes to the amounts of weight we pack on when we do sets of 1-5 reps, it's pretty high, and at some point, when you're testing your max, you have to think "just lift the god damn weight". Even though your form breaks, you're still working the muscles involved. It's just that if you make a habit of this, that's when it gets critical. 

You'll find that most athletes in these sports have very lean and muscular bodies, as is required to perform optimally. 

Protein shakes are mainly based on whey protein, which is the leftover when milk is coagulated during the process of cheese production. It is the same type of protein that you'll find in a lot of dairy products like milk, ricotta, etc. As such, there is no reason to fear protein shakes. However, I am reluctant to recommend using protein powder. As with boys of any age, whether he's 10 or 100, regulating the diet should be the first course of action. While I don't have the full knowledge of what you've tried, and how long you've tried it, I suggest trying to feed your boy some smaller meals of high-nutrition foods, rather than resorting to supplements. Because that's what protein powder is; a supplement. It is meant to go alongside a healthy diet. Not to replace it. Remember that protein isn't everything. He needs carbohydrates and fats too, and all of this is more adequately given by a meal than a shake. So again, I recommend trying to feed him smaller meals of more well-chosen foods. Any dinner should consist of a protein (meat/fish/eggs/google-more), a starch (potato/rice/google-more) and vegetables. If he can eat one salmon fillet, one potato, and a couple vegetables, that would be far more healthy than a protein shake for dinner. If push comes to shove, at least make sure that he's lacking protein in particular. Replacing dinners with a protein shake can lead him to lack carbohydrates and/or fat instead, which in turn can lead to symptoms like chronic exhaustion and tiredness. So be alert, whatever you choose to do. And if all else fails, go see a doctor. 

14000J = 3346 calories = 3.346 kcal. Unfortunately, you forget that our calorie measurements are commonly done in kilocalories, so you're off by a factor of 1000. Other than that, your physics calculation is solid enough. Energy spent during ascension is simply proportional to the change in elevation, or more precicely, change in potential energy. But I highly doubt that each floor is only 1 meter. That must be wrong. 

This isn't a secret we're keeping to ourselves. If we had the knowledge to gain equal progress WITHOUT anabolic steroids, why would people still be using anabolic steroids? 

This is a result of not moving the butt and torso as a unit, but rather separately. The good morning stance can lead to severe back injury if repeated instead of corrected. Onwards to the question 

I can't make a definitive statement about the salt contents of the tuna you buy. But an adult should eat no more than 6 grams of salt per day. If you keep this in mind, I'm sure you'll be fine. 

Isometric versus Concentric Training Each kind of training produces the greatest improvement when strength tests used are similar to those of training. Most improvements are observed when the test routine matches the training routine. Exercise-type specificity is supported. Improvement in functional (sporting) performance is the most practical criterion for comparing training effectiveness of various types of exercise, despite functional activities usually being more complex and employing additional capacities to the performance of the trained muscle groups. It appears that concentric training may be superior to static training for improving performance although more research needs to be conducted to conclusively define an answer. Isometric versus Eccentric Training It is unclear as to whether isometric training is superior to eccentric training in increasing isometric strength, with the majority of studies indicating no difference. One study has reported eccentric training superior for developing eccentric strength. There are no reports comparing the effects of the two forms of training on functional strength. In conclusion, there seems to be a tendency that the modality of training is the modality of function you'd be improving. Source: Morrissey, M. C., Harman, E. A., & Johnson, M. J. (1995). Resistance training modes: Specificity and effectiveness. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 27 Anecdotally I feel the need to mention that my preferred isometric exercises revolve around smaller muscle groups, where size growth is harder to accomplish (e.g. forearms, calves). Particularly training grip strength isometrically has allowed me to increase the weight at which I need to start using wraps for deadlifts. 

Your first and biggest mistake was expecting visible results after just a month. Whatever results you do gain over such a small period of time, are going to be invisible to the naked eye, simply because you see yourself in the mirror too often. It seems to me like your diet is good, if you're trying to bulk. I.e. gain weight, both in terms of muscle and fat. And honestly, that's what you should be doing for a good while. Then later, you can cut, meaning lowering your bodyfat percentage. But really, if you're serious about this, take a before-picture now (if you haven't already), and train for a year at the very least, then start comparing. Also, log your workouts. For a good long while, the changes won't be visible in the mirror, and the only thing that will tell you that you're making progress, is the numbers you write down during your workouts. 

Yes, the exercise is commonly referred to as a "back raise", and is done on a pretty rudimentary piece of equipment. Here are some you can buy on eBay: $URL$ At some point, you might feel the need to add resistance, so you could incorporate holding some weight plates, or something equivalent. 

The thing that happens when your back rounds is that you're not actually engaging the erectors. You're not flexing them OR they're not strong enough to withstand the weight. Thus, they're not actually being trained. They're just being pulled apart by a force greater than they can withstand. 

I would question any program that sets any of this in stone. In the big picture, the order here is a tiny detail. Which exercise you do first will have no effect on your goal of burning fat and gaining strength. Now, here's the kicker: If you want to reap all the benefits, go for variation. Don't stick to always doing exercise A before exercise B. You should vary this. You could 

Soreness Cherish it. It's not a way of measuring how effective your workout was, but it should tell you that you've done something out of your comfort zone, and that's good! The more you train, the less of it you'll have. But generally, don't worry about it. Sudden weakness This is important. Learn this immediately!! When you train, you break the muscle fibers down. When you rest and eat, you build the muscles back up, stronger. So essentially, you failed your pushups, because your chest and tricep muscles were already weakened from your previous workout(s). We like to go to the 48 hour "rule of thumb", and suggest that you don't train the same muscle groups two days in a row, but give them at least one day of rest before you train them again. This can be overlooked if you eat and rest a LOT between each workout, but again, the 48 hour rule of thumb is a good place to start to see how you handle it. Weight gain 2 kg in 1 week is fine, but it goes under "easy come, easy go". A week is a very short period of time, and what you accomplish in a week can be lost in another week. But what you gain in a year, sticks with you for much, much longer. Smoking Obviously, quitting smoking is the way to go. You know it, we know it, I don't think it warrants too much of a reply, besides... Good luck! 

I'm going to agree with whoever suggested swimming to you in the past. The water provides resistance, and the distance provides the heartrate. In effect, it's both a strength exercise, and a cardiovascular exercise. In the end though, fat burning is most effectively done in the kitchen, as whatever calories you burn in an hour on a treadmill, can be undone in three minutes eating the wrong food. Learning the basics of nutrition is going to do far more for your fat percentage, than any one exercise. 

Yes, and the bodybuilders of yesteryear looked pretty damn different from what they do now. Case in point; here's Mr. Olympia 40 years ago, vs. today. Look, here's the answer to the question you're afraid to ask. How can I look like a bodybuilder without using the same supplements as they use? You can't. They use these supplements to break the barriers that the human body imposes on itself. Through decades of research, we have come up with the best way to do so, and the bodybuilders you see compete for the title of Mr. Olympia, are the result of this research. If you want to look like they do, do what they do. 

You don't die because you run out of heartbeats. You run out of heartbeats because you die. Since death is certain, we have a limited number of heartbeats. But pay attention to the chain of causality. "The man is from New York, therefore he is from the United States" holds. "The man is from the United States, therefore he is from New York" does not hold. So no, your lifespan is not dictated by your bpm. 

I was in the middle of writing pretty much the same calculation that @DeeV did, so I'll skip that, and supplement his answer with some additional information instead. Weightlifting to burn fat? The long and short of it is that calories burned during weight training is so negligible, that you shouldn't spend any time thinking about it. You should choose your weight training program based on other factors. And in any case, like we've discussed earlier, you should be cycling between a bunch of different programs, so whichever ones you like, line them up, and do a few months of each. The best ways to burn fat ...are done firstly by regulating your diet, and secondly by exercising in ways that increase your heartrate. DeeV mentions that 25 reps of 50kg squatting (or any up-and-down exercise for that matter) burns 7.5 kcal. If you do 7 sets of this (that is 7 sets of 25 reps at 50kg), you will have burned roughly 500 kcal. Or roughly a Snickers bar. So if you're looking to burn fat, it takes you 5 seconds to forego the Snickers bar, but it would take you days to do 7sets * 25reps @ 50kg. The mindset If you're already pretty good at not eating candies and sweets, your bodyfat is getting to you from other sources, and losing fat is all about finding the weak spots in your dietary habits, and eliminating them. Personally, I find it much easier to forego the "bad" foods when I do a simple calculation as demonstrated above, and realize just how big of a difference it makes to, say, have a glass of water rather than soda, or another helping of vegetables and one less of meat. 

I recommend Strava. It lets you find segments (trails) in your area using your GPS, and they are created and curated by the community, but also moderated by... well, moderators. It lets you look at segments by length, whether it's flat or hilly, and the level of inclination/steepness. I assume that's what you mean by "difficulty"? It keeps track of your records, so you can compete with your previous times. It also lets you publish your times, so you can compete with others who have completed the same segment. It allows you to choose between running/cycling too, in case you want to diversify your training. 

I think it's entirely possible that what you lack in size is due to what you've lacked in the volume of work. I'm not saying it's wrong to work this or that rep-range, but it's largely agreed upon that if you want to prioritize size-gain, then you should consider increasing the volume of the work. I.e. the number of total reps performed. There are some pretty decent programs out there for those who want to gain size, and I'm sure you'll be able to find it by googling. Also there, I expect you'll find that there is more emphasis on total volume of work, as well as a good chunk of isolation work. That said, I think burning some fat will do your body more justice. It's often the case that we build strength while gaining both muscle and fat, and if we spend some time shedding some fat afterwards, we'll start to reap the aesthetic rewards of our work. For instance, you could probably lose, say, 10kg of fat while maintaining most, or even all, of your strength. And as you no doubt agree, a 90kg person with those 1RMs is going to look more defined and muscular than a 100kg person with the same achievements. I feel like I'm mostly just confirming what you already suspect. You seem to have it figured out, to be honest. :)
