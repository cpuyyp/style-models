Source. As noted in the article, a drum has one node. The sun has many nodes, so it's more complicated. It's the studying of those many nodes that gives insight into the inside of the sun. The problem with doing that on a gas giant planet is, (and I'm partially guessing here), I don't believe a gas giant planet is solid enough to behave like a drum. The convection (and gas giant planets are full of convection in their upper layers) would likely dilute any studyable patterns or nodes from it's interior, much like how wind reduces sound waves. I don't believe this method would work on gas giant planets. 

There are by this estimate, at least 200,000 pulsars in the milky-way. A map of 14 of them won't do someone on the other side of the galaxy if our map has some errors (which Voyager's might) or if they don't have a good chart on the other side of the galaxy. Pulsars are very precise and they can make very landmarks if you have enough of them and properly spaced. Also, stars move, so maps age and lose accuracy over time, but in your star-wars example, a human lifetime wouldn't change things much. Other possible landmarks include X-ray binaries, very large stars (less common than smaller ones), black holes, neutron stars, the age of stars could be used, contact binaries, nebulas (or is that nebulae), stellar nurseries. Identifying an individual planet would be easy given good data and a complete map. A typical modern computer could do it, but the trick is having a good map. There's about 100 billion stars in the Milky way, so it comes down to how good the map is, but you're correct, if the small map is good, R2's larger galaxy map is irrelevant. To be relevant, the smaller map should have been maybe 100-500 stars and R2's map nearly the entire galaxy, and there would be ways to make the map useless if it fell into enemy hands, by not including pulsars or star size, making it very very difficult to identify which part of the galaxy by just 100 stars, none of them distinct. The principal of needing both maps is valid and could be done, but you're right that the size of the 2nd map was ridiculous, also, why would they need to track his journey like in the picture?. Movies often ignore the finer points like that and just focus on what looks cool. 

I want to point out that the Moon's orbit isn't circular now. A 0.055 mean eccentricity isn't that circular. But, onto your question. I think you're making a bad assumption on the "must have started very elliptic. Individual objects that are ejected from a planet need to follow their orbital path. So any object flung from the earth would need likely either escape the Earth or fall back into it because you can't launch something, with a singular push, into a circular orbit. All the individual bits of debris should have had highly eccentric orbits. But the formation of the Moon was much more complicated than that. First, it was enough matter to have it's own gravitational field, basically influencing itself, and the forming moon would be the combination of all those individual objects, so it wouldn't necessarily be eliptic at all. The eccentricity of billions of objects could have (and likely did) cancel each other out to a large degree. Because the impact was off-center, it set the Earth spinning and most of the debris moved in the same direction around the Earth. But the coalescing mass of material that didn't fall back to the Earth could have been in a reasonably circular orbit at formation. We should also define what number constitutes "highly" elliptic. The Moon is thought to have started out 3-5 Earth Radii distant. Any material that passed closer than 3 radii would have been inside the Roche limit and had a hard time coalescing into the Moon. This article suggests that the debris would have had a hard time being ejected further than 5 Earth Radii, though I'm not sure how that conclusion was reached. But you have a few things going on. Debris colliding with other debris, and some (presumably quite a bit) of debris falling back to the Earth and, mentioned above, the debris having a gravitational effect on itself. Ultimately momentum needs to be conserved and calculating the formation of the Moon requires a super-computer, but in general I think the initial orbit could have been relatively circular. If the Moon formed close to the Earth, which most models suggest it did and since it couldn't pass inside 3 Earth Radii and stay solid, those numbers put a limit on how eccentric the initial orbit probably was. If we use the 5/3 Earth Radii as an estimate, Ra=5, Rp=3, then the eccentricity is 0.25, and that's an estimate for the upper limit of the initial eccentricity after formation. It may well have been quite a bit less. 

I think, a more correct way to look at hawking radiation is to see it as something that forms just outside of the black hole, a particle/anti particle pair and one escapes and the other falls inside, and that's probably not 100% correct either, but the singularity itself doesn't send out particles. Hawking radiation has to do with quantum properties of space. It's not a property of black holes. The black hole just happens to be unique in that it can capture one half of a virtual particle pair and the other half can escape. This also is a pretty different topic than your original question. 

So, basically you're trying to merge orbital inclination to Kepler's laws. The simplest way is to take the measured orbital inclination of the planet, which is constant, and apply the Pythagorean theorem to any given location and that gives you 3 dimensions of distance from the 2 dimensions defined in Kepler's laws. That's probably what Kepler did. (see picture from the Wikipedia link above) 

We don't know that it's a black hole, even with the image. It kind of looks like a black hole drawing matter from the star, but there's a few problems with the image, and I'll get to that later. A couple times in the show Elaine Renko (Agyness Deyn) says "I don't know what it is". She's presumably seen more of the data than anyone alive outside of the government insiders, so the show is careful not to commit to a specific scenario and the image only gives a little bit of information, so it could be a number of things. Because they never said what it is, it's harder to criticize the science. 

Likely more Neurinos are produced billions of years ago than today because there were more very large stars in young galaxies. I'm not going to touch the first few seconds after the big bang. Someone else can if they want, but post star formation, it's a surprisingly simple problem to work out. Neutrinos are produced primarily in nuclear reactions in stars. Large stars produce far more than smaller stars. A star with 10 solar masses, would, very roughly, produce about 10,000 more neutrinos. Stars that size are uncommon because they only live about 10-15 million years. Only about 1 in 800 stars are B-type or greater in terms of neutrino production and most of those are only a few solar masses, producing between maybe 50 and 500 times the number of neutrinos our sun produces. Very high neutrino producing stars are sufficiently rare that they don't throw off the numbers. (I'm ignoring supernovas, but I'll get to that). If we estimate 100 billion stars in the milky way, the larger ones give off far more neutrinos than our sun and the smaller ones, far fewer. And our sun gives off 1.79 x 10^38 neutrinos per second. Doing some very bad estimating, all the stars in the Milky way together give off probably in the range of 1 x 10^49 neutrinos per second. Figuring our sun, being on the large size, gives off more neutrino to mass ratio than average, but not enormously more). Again, we're ignoring supernovas. You'll see why soon. So, bad estimate, 1 x 10^49 per second from all the stars in the galaxy, or 3 x 10^56 per year. Or 1 x 10^58 in about 30 years. (Why do I care about 10^58 you ask?) Because that's the number of neutrinos that the type II supernova observed in 1987 released. Source. So one type II nova produces the same number of neutrinos as all the stars in the milky way currently produce in about 30 years, give or take. The milkyway has an estimated one billion neutron stars and about 100 million stellar mass black holes. Each of those can only form by type 2 supernovae. Given the age of the Milkyway, about 13 billion years, if we average it out, that's one type II supernovae every 12 years or so. The current rate is much slower, so the young milky way had significantly more type 2 supernovae than it currently averages, and, it would be consistant that there were significantly more large stars. Even with significantly fewer smaller and main sequence stars, the large stars and type II nova are the clear winners in neutrino production. The current supernova rate (Type 1 and II) in the milky way is one every 50 years, so the rate had to be several times higher when the galaxy was young. Peak Neutrino production would coincide with peak type II supernova explosions, which would only be 5-15 million years or so after peak very large star formation. I don't mention Type 1 supernova, because, while more common now, they (I think) produce far fewer neutrinos. Still a great deal, but well fewer than 10^58, though I had some difficulty finding a specific number. It's very likely that young spiral galaxies like our milky way produce (very bad guess), maybe 10 times more neutrinos than they produce some 13 billion years after formation, so that would be the most likely answer. Once large star formation in galaxies was well underway, Neutrino production probably peaked, whether that was when the universe was a few hundred million years old or a couple billion, I don't know, but neutrino production likely peaked early with the formation of many large stars and began a steady gradual decline after the peak. Corrections welcome.
