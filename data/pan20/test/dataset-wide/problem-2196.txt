My understanding is that this is done in critical situations, as when there are opposing men on base, usually more than one. Is this true and if so, why is that? Is it to increase the chances of striking out the next batter, or otherwise decrease that chances of the batter making contact with the ball that may even get him out, but advance the runners? 

This came up because Mike Trout, arguably the best player in baseball, will be up for arbitration next year. Salary arbitration has the effect of paying a first, second or third year "arb" player about 40 percent, 60 percent, or 80 percent of what he would be making as a free agent. This is after three years of "minimum wage" (about $500,000). Trout's value has been estimated at $40-$50 million (for a free agent), and many believe that he could get $15 million (or more) in first year arbitration. A qualifying offer is the average of the top 125 salaries. It is an objective way to determine who is a "Type A" free agent that cost the signing team a draft pick. Does the qualifying offer (which could be about $15 million next season) in any way impact how much Trout could make in arbitration? 

Most teams will use their best starter for Opening Day, the second best on the second day, etc. through the rotation. Except when other factors intervene; for instance, the White Sox ace Chris Sale pitched the Sox' fourth game, because injuries meant that he wasn't ready for Opening Day. And the Pirates' Francisco Liriano, who pitched Opening Day, took paternity leave and pitched the fourth game of the following series. My understanding is that while aces are better than "backenders"on the same team, they don't necessarily have better records, because they pitch against other aces, while backenders pitch against other backenders. Does this hold through a season, or do "rotational" factors allow aces to sometimes pitch against backenders? And do aces' win-loss records in fact, improve, when they are pitted against backenders? 

The Toronto Blue Jays took away catcher Russell Martin in free agency from the Pittsburgh Pirates after the Pirates made Martin a "qualifying offer" As a result, the Blue Jays lose a first-round draft pick, and the Pirates get a compensating pick in the "sandwich" round between the first and second rounds. My understanding is that teams are now allowed to use so-called "compensating balance" picks in trades. I was wondering if the Pirates could also "trade back" the draft pick they get from the Blue Jays using one of two mechanisms. (Say the Pirates trade the draft pick and a prospect for a player.) Mechanism 1 works only if the Pirates have to file for the compensating pick. Then the Pirates could say to the Blue Jays, we'll give you prospect X for player Y, and in addition, we'll let the deadline pass for filing for the compensation pick, meaning that you get to keep yours. (This mechanism doesn't work if the Blues Jays lose, and the Pirates gain, the draft pick "automatically.") Mechanism 2 is a player to be named later PBNL. That is, the Pirates trade the prospect and a PBNL to the Blue Jays for the player. On draft day, 2015, when the Pirates are about to make their compensating pick, the Blue Jays tell them who to pick, and the Pirates hand him over as the PBNL. Can a draft pick be "traded" using either or both of those two mechanisms? 

In Little League play, a 13-year old girl, Mo'ne Davis, stunned the baseball world with her 70 mph fastball. Assuming that she "fills out" adequately during her adolescence, it is at least within the realm of possibility that she will develop a 90+ mph fastball with the requisite control to pitch in the majors. And if not her, perhaps another woman like her. This situation came about because in baseball, you "play the ball, not the man." Assuming you have the required skills to handle the ball, you don't have to worry about being "overpowered" by a larger man. Are there other sports other than baseball (or tennis, another "non-contact" sport) where there are female high schoolers (or college players) "coming up" that could plausibly play professionally against men? Or are the odds considered too long in contact sports? 

A professional football player gives the last school where he had "trained," before joining a professional team. More often than not, that means a college. And he may or may not have graduated (many football players attend college for the chance to "play," rather than for the education, and leave as soon as a team will sign them, that is, after three years). Sometimes, it could refer to a player that attended college for five years, but was "red shirted" by the team for one year. (That means that the player was put through an extra year of training but was technically not a member of the team because he was not allowed to play for that year, and therefore only played for "four.") If a player joined the team out of a high school, with no college "education," he will use the high school as his affiliation. 

Some baseball players will spend time between the minor and major leagues before getting firmly established in the major leagues. In the process of "shuttling" back and forth, the player can be sent back to the minor leagues by "optioning" him to the minor league team. There is a limited number of "options." (If a player is out options, other teams can claim a player that has been sent to the minors before he gets there.) But suppose you have a veteran who was injured, and then cured, and needs to play a few "rehab" games in the minors before coming to the majors. How can this veteran be sent to a minor league team without the "optioning" mechanism? 

Is there a common word for "base on (four) balls," hit by pitch, balk, or anything else that might let a batter get on first base without hitting the ball? The term I liked to use was "walk," but I've been told that is synonymous with "base on balls," and doesn't include the others. Or does it? 

Suppose there is a runner on first. The batter hits a fly ball, and runs to first. The runner on first, anticipating that the ball will be caught, "barely" leaves first, with the expectation of returning there. The ball is caught but the batter has touched first base in the meantime. Can the runner on first return there or is he out because the batter touched first base? Should the batter refrain from touching first base until the ball hits the ground? (My understanding is that the runner on first is out if the batter BYpasses him on the way to second, but this is a slightly different situation.) 

A pitcher can be either left- or right handed, but the better ones pitch reasonably well to both left and right handed batters. When you get to the fifth starter on the roster, however, many teams are dealing with marginal throwers. Some bating teams have relatively more of left-or right-handed batters. So use one pitcher against the one set of teams and the other pitcher against the other set of teams. Jeff Locke and Brandon Cumpton of Pittsburgh come to mind. One is a lefty and one is a righty. Are there any teams that in fact, do this, because they have "fifth" starters on the roster who throw a lot better against either left- or right handed batters? Perhaps combined with another back end starter who has "platoon" splits the other way? Meaning that it would make sense to "platoon" a "backend" starter role so that the tandem may actually be better than a fifth starter? 

WHIP stands for "walks and hits (allowed) per inning pitched." It is a measure of the rate at which a pitcher allows opposing batters to get on base. I don't quite agree with another answerer who says it's a "poor tool" to evaluate pitchers. The "walks" or W part of the equation are entirely under control of the pitchers. What the other person meant was that HITS aren't regarded as entirely under the control of pitchers, because of fielding issues. There are two more items that define a pitcher. Strikeouts aren't explicitly included in the WHIP formula, but they feed indirectly into the "hits" part of the equation; the more strikeouts, the fewer opportunities for hits. The last thing is home runs, (or other extra base hits). All other things equal, a pitcher with a lower WHIP than another will give up fewer runs, but a pitcher with a low WHIP and a high home run rate (e.g. the Pittsburgh Pirates' Edinson Volquez) might still give up a lot of runs. 

By "long" delay, I mean an hour or more. On one hand, a pitcher that has pitched two or three innings, and is interrupted by rain gets a chance to rest. On the other hand, perhaps a pitcher has warmed up, and gotten into a "rhythm." Then perhaps the delay "undid" all this work. Has a pitcher been likely to pitch the same way after a rain delay as before? Suppose there is more than one rain delay in the game. Has it been disruptive to most pitchers? I was think in terms of last night's game, San Diego vs. Pittsburgh. Why did San Diego relieve its starter after two innings and an almost two hour rain delay, when he had given up no runs? 

Suppose you're down a couple break points in a set, so you have no reasonable chance of winning it. You are serving in what would be the sixth (and set) game for your opponent. If you win the game, your opponent will have to serve for the sixth game, and you get to go onto to the next set with the serve. If you lose, your opponent serves first in the next set. Yet, I've seen top players even at the grand slam events tacitly concede that sixth game, while on serve. Apparently they want to get to the next set. But why would they do this? If the server has the advantage, why not try to take advantage of this for a (relatively) easy win? Conversely, if you're down 5-1, with the opponent on serve, might it make sense to concede the game on the opponent's serve to get to the next set with you on serve? 

A football field has exactly 100 yards between to "end zones" of a specified size, and a specific width. Likewise, the dimensions of a soccer field, hockey rink, tennis or basketball courts are highly specific. Why are baseball fields different to the point where there are "pitchers'" parks, and "hitters' parks" because of the home run distance and other factors? And, in fact, the "infields" of baseball are basically the same size and shape. So what caused outfields, and hence the parks overall, to be so different? 

There is one more scenario which results in R2 being out. That is, if R2 left the baseline (by more than 10 feet or so) trying to avoid the tag. But stopping does not make the runner automatically out. He created what is called a "fielders" choice, to force the third baseman to choose between putting him out or the batter. The ploy worked, the baseman chose to put out the batter, and that's that. 

Basically, as long as the ball is "in play," a runner is allowed to run to any open base. The runner from first is allowed to run to second, or back to first. The runner from second is allowed to run to third, or back to second (in the last case, he prevents the runner from first from using second base). Most runners that are "caught" in this way prefer to run to the nearest base. If the runner from second is actually closer to third base, he's past the "point of no return" and should run to third base, and leave second base open to the other runner. What usually happens is that the defense concentrates on one runner, leaving the other runner free. The most likely scenario is that they concentrate on getting out the first base runner, which means that the second base runner gets a "free pass" to third. If the defense then throws to third, maybe they overthrow and both runners advance. A good throw to third might nail the lead runner, but the first base runner advances to second in compensation. The most likely result in these situations is that one runner is sacrificed to allow the other runner to advance. If both runners manage to advance, that's a good result for the batting team; getting both runners out is a good result for the defense. 

Henderson Alvarez of the Miami Marlins pitched a "perfect game" over the tops of nine innings. Going into the bottom of the ninth, the score was tied 0-0, but Miami scored a 1-0 walk-off with a wild pitch with two outs. Would Alvarez have gotten credit for a "perfect game" if the Marlins hadn't scored? After all, he did pitch nine perfect innings.
