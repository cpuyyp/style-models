Juri Apresjan, a famous Russian lexicographer, uses the term "synonymic series," whose dominant is "a lexeme which has the most general meaning in the given series." For further details see Apresjan 2000, Systematic Lexicography. For example, the dominant of the synonymic series "strong, stout, sturdy, stalwart, tough, tenacious" is strong. Incidentally, the level and scope of lexicographic research in Novyj objasnitel'nyj slovar' sinonimov russkogo iazyka (Apresjan et al. 2004, 2nd edition), compiled by Apresjan's research group, is unprecedented. Unfortunately, no dictionary of synonyms published in English, German, or French comes even closer to the comprehensiveness and detailedness of Apresjan et al. 2004. 

Phrase stress: Bennett 1972, Quinlin 1991 (and also his 1989 dissertation), Hoptman 2002. However, Tsimmerling 2007 finds this analysis irrefutable. The low tone (in the initial pretonic position): Ivanov 1999 (and earlier). He suggests that "the Indo-European particle/adverbial element *kom could be used both as an enclitic or as a proclitic." etc. It seems no one is willing to abandon the ban on the Anlaut position though. A couple of very important notes. First, gone is the time of the notorious Neogrammarian motto "sound laws have no exceptions." See Hoptman 2002 and Tsimmerling 2007 for more exceptions to Verner's law; Bernhardsson 2001 for a possible explanation. Second, we don't really know for sure when Verner's law started to function (in Proto-Germanic? Before or after Grimm's law?) and how long it functioned. Also, there have been several attempts to merge Grimm's and Verner's laws into one. And, finally, the most importing thing to remember is that 

In Latin, there was total regressive assimilation in a combination of an occlusive (Verschlusslaut) followed by f: 

I'd like to add a very important point here. On the verge of saying a truism (for generativists), I'd like to remind you that grammaticality is not acceptability. Your informants can decide whether this or that sentence is acceptable. However, it is the job of a linguist to collect data, analyse it, and write a grammar of that language. Only a linguist can determine the grammaticality of a sentence. There are other, non-grammatical factors, that may have an impact on acceptability, such as age, gender, social group etc. and, last but not least, psycholinguistic factors (i.e. a sentence is difficult to parse, your informant is tired etc). To make things worse, we learned a very important lesson from generative syntax: acceptability is gradient. A good grammar is the one that tries to explain as much data as possible. However, a grammar that completely captures your data is impossible. The perfect match between grammatical and acceptable sentences is theoretically unattainable. 

Theological issues aside, I can see several wrong assumptions in your question. "The word God is a relatively new European invention, which was never used in any of the ancient Judaeo-Christian scripture manuscripts that were written in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek or Latin." It's not entirely clear what you meant there. If you are talking about the English word "god", then why would you expect to come across an English word in a Latin or Greek text? If you are talking about the concept of "god(s)", then your assumption is inaccurate. It is a well-known fact that various Indo-European peoples had gods, attested by names of deities (Jupiter, Zeus, Perkunas etc.) and the word 'god', e.g. Latin 'deus', Vedic 'devas' etc. As a matter of fact, Father Sky is a very common deity in many IE cultures. A common motif is the main god fighting/killing some chthonic creature (a snake or a dragon). Now about "Gad" and English "god". The wrong assumption here is what Yuri Otkupschikov called "chronological scissors" (chronological disparity). You are comparing words that don't belong to the same time period. Yes, in OE the word was "god" but looking at other Germanic languages you can't help but notice that originally the root vowel was not "o" but rather "u", e.g. have a look at this. I'm not a Hebraist (nor a Semitologist) but here's what I've been able to find about the origin of the Hebrew proper noun "Gad". I strongly recommend looking it up at least in Klein 1987: 

Just wanted to clarify things. False cognates are words that exhibit chance similarity (or chance resemblance). 

Word-initial PIE *sr- > L. fr- L. frigus, cf. G. ῥῖγος Word-medial PIE *-sr- > L. -br- L. funebris, cf. L. funus, funeris The intermediate stage was PIE *sr > PIt. *θr. (Baldi 1999: 284; Leummann 1977, §194, §207; Sihler 1995, §225.2: Weiss 2009/2011: 163) 

Geert Booij defines inherent inflection as “inflection of a word that is not required by its syntactic context” whereas by contextual inflection he understands “inflection that is required by the syntactic context in which a word occurs” (Booij 2007). He gives some examples, e.g. he argues that case markings on nouns are contextual but the present tense on the verb is inherent inflection. It seems that inherent inflection is indeed equivalent to interpretable features in MP (understood as those features that have an effect on semantic interpretation, e.g. Adger 2003), whereas contextual inflection is equivalent to uninterpretable features. 

Memorize the IPA chart - this includes, first, the ability to read the IPA (it requires lots of practice). You can test yourself by reading the broad transcription of the North Wind and the Sun passage (for American English first); it can be found e.g. in the IPA Handbook on p. 44. Then you can read the same passage transcribed for other English dialects. You're a native speaker of American English, so you shouldn't really struggle with the IPA consonants (for English). Mastering the IPA vowels could be more challenging. Start transcribing single (isolated) English words - broad transcription only - and then start transcribing sentences. Some exercises in Ladefoged A course in Phonetics (a standard intro text), pp. 48-52 should help. 

Strictly speaking, palatalization in phonetics is a secondary gesture, and in IPA it is graphically represented as a superscript "j", [dʲ]. So, in my opinion, there is a difference between [dʲ] and [dj]. The former is one (palatalized) sound, the latter is two sounds, a voiced dental stop followed by a palatal approximant. I haven't checked it in Praat yet but I'm almost certain that you'll see that difference on a spectrogram. Although there are palatalized stops in Russian, I've never seen/read anyone talking about palatalized stops in English. I will be more than happy to "get educated", if I'm wrong.
