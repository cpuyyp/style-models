The usual answer is that Russia abolished slavery in 1723. Technically speaking, there were no more slaves in Russia after this point. In reality, it meant they were merged into the class of serfs, whose lives were barely distinguishable from the formally enslaved anyway. 

Now for some specific examples. One of the more tragic cases is Alice de Lacy, an heir to two earldoms. She was first abducted in 1317, despite still being married to Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, by men loyal to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. This was actually not a bridal kidnapping since Warenne ended up not marrying her, but after Thomas was executed as a traitor in 1322, much of Alice's lands were confiscated and given away - to Warenne's benefit. Alice then remarried to a household knight, Eubulus le Strange, apparently for love. After his death however, the then 54 year old Alice was abducted again by Hugh de Freyne. This time, she was forced to marry her captor. Contemporaneous with Alice de Lacy were the de Clare sisters, Margaret, Eleanor, and Elizabeth. Their father Gilbert de Clare was one of the wealthiest men in Medieval England, so when his only son fell in battle without issue in 1314, the three sisters became co-heirs to his vast fortune. Unfortunately, this made them extremely coveted targets. Elizabeth, was first married to John de Burgh, an heir to an Irish earldom. They had a son, but John died in 1313, and Elizabeth was recalled to England by her uncle the King. King Edward II probably hoped to arrange a marriage, but his plan hit a snag when Elizabeth was then abducted by minor Irish noble Theobald de Verdon. He might have known her in Ireland, but was 17 years Elizabeth's senior, and died shortly afterwards. Edward II then pressured a pregnant Elizabeth to marry Roger d'Amory, at the time his court favourite. Elizabeth widowed for a third time at only 26 years old when d'Armory lost favour and died in the Dispenser War. Eleanor was married to Hugh Despenser the Younger, another favourite of Edward II. This marriage survived much longer than her unfortunate sister's, but in 1326 Edward II had Hugh hanged, drawn and quartered. William la Zouche, a baron who had helped captured Hugh, then abducted his widow Eleanor from her castle and married her. Unlike her sisters, Margaret managed to survive these turmoil decades personally unscathed. She was married twice, first to Piers Gaveston and, after his death, to Hugh de Audley. With Hugh she had one daughter, also called Margaret. However, in 1334, the younger Margaret was abducted as a teen by Ralph de Stafford, a middle aged widower. 

It depends on the location and time. Using the number of chariots to denote the size of an army is most often a Spring and Autumn practice. During this period, the traditional, ritualistic formal system of the Chou Dynasty degraded and gave way to ad hoc reforms. Part of these reforms is changes in military organisation. The Chou dynasty prescribed extensive rules governing most aspects of social and political life within their empire. These applied both to the royal domains, as well as most Chou-aligned tribal states concentrated in the Central Plains. This original military system called for 30 soldiers for each chariot. That included 3 heavy infantry riding on the chariot, 7 more on foot, and 20 light infantry. At this stage, warfare was still a nobility centric event, and the light infantry were more servants than soldiers. At the start of the Spring and Autumn period, despite severe prestige and territorial losses by the Imperial Chou court when it moved east, many states still followed these rulse (even though they no longer obeyed royal commands). By mid to late Spring and Autumn, increased warfare have caused the main states to restructure their military service. When the Chou Dynasty supplanted the Shang Dynasty, it established what is effectively colonies across its new territories. These "garrisons" (so to speak) became tribal cores for the Chou vassal states, and their descendants the ruling class. As citizens (, who live in the capital and the suburbs), they participated in state politics and for obvious reasons service in the army was restricted to them. As warfare expanded, by necessity the states all enlarged their manpower pool. This was done by conscripting the conquered servile class (, who lived away from the city and in the fields). Still, riding and controlling the all-important chariot was a skill requiring long training, and as such remained the province of the lower nobility. Thus, to make use of the enlarged manpower pool, the chariot military unit was expanded to 75 soldiers per chariot, plus an additional 25 men logistic section. All in all this included: 

Of course, "heaven commands it" is largely a hand wave and an euphemism for "they got lucky". As that sentence admits, many commentators placed the blame in more concrete places by attributing Wei's downfall to not using Lord Xinling. That's part of a broader trend attributing the demise of the Six States to failing to give the right people power. This is often a result of Qin successes in getting rid of skilled enemy commanders via espionage. 

Authorities did try to deal with the problem, especially in France. Raping civilians of allies being less tolerated. Notably however, the Army scapegoated black servicemen for reported crimes: 

England was by no means "much" further away from France. The Strait of Dover is only 33.3km away from France at the closest. You can see Calais atop the White Cliffs, and vice versa. So even if it was appreciably more dangerous to sail across the North Sea, such a journey could be avoided by simply taking a short hop from France. And in fact, the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain began in the Southeastern England. Eopwinesfleot , in Kent, is preserved in chronicles as the site where Hengist and Horsa first landed in Britain. More concretely, East Anglia is generally regarded to be the first to be settled by the Anglo-Saxons. Both locations are within easy distance from continental coast. 

It is perhaps not strictly accurate to say warrant officers were appointed by the Board of Admiralty. In general, they actually received their warrants from the Navy Board, which was the Royal Navy's administrative body until it was merged into the Admiralty in 1832. The Navy Board kept records of candidates for a warrant. When a vacancy opens up on a ship, it would (in theory) be filled by promoting suitably qualified mates with the appropriate specialty, more or less on the basis of experience. Captains were generally given commissioned officers by the Admiralty, and warrant officers by the Navy Board. Only the petty officers were under the Captain's authority. An exception was when the ship is away from Britain. Then, the captain was allowed to nominate a certified person to the position, but these were subject to re-examination and confirmation by the Navy Board later. 

It's the same reason why Europe was more religiously tolerant in Roman times (except to Christians). Namely, a lack of religious exclusiveness in their native beliefs. When Buddhism was transmitted to Japan, for example, the local population have no trouble reconciling Buddhist doctrines with their native Shintoism. The Shinto kami were integrated into Buddhist cycle of death and reincarnation, while the Buddhist deities were incorporated among the kami. Thus, although Japan had a strong national religion, its inclusive nature allowed it to accommodate the importation of Buddhism. In China, the belief system was dominated by Confucianism, ever since it was adopted as the national philosophy by Emperor Wu of Han. Confucianism prescribed many near-theological tenets that demand religious observance, but makes no real statements on the existence or non existence of other deities. It was happy to co-exist with both Taoism and the later introduction of Buddhism - as long as there was no conflict of interest. Note that in both China and Japan (since you tagged those countries), persecution of religious groups did occur. For example, the Three Purges of Buddhism in China. Purges took place in response to perceived political threats or for other political reasons. Emperor Wuzhong of Tang imitated a purge to increase tax revenues (they were tax-exempt). In Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the expulsion of Christians because he was feared the Roman Catholic organisationa and the possibility of religious revolts. He might also have been concerned about reports of Japanese individuals being abducted and sold abroad as slaves. 

When Byrant wrote her Six Red Months in Russia in 1918, it was not unreasonable to make the same mistake as Lenin. Communism was still essentially theoretical; the idealistic belief that it could compete favourably against capitalism in terms of economic output had not yet been undermined by decades of underwhelming reality. Meanwhile, belief in the inevitability of class war underpinned the ideology. In fact, shortly before her book was published, the Allies did intervene against the Communist revolutionaries. Had their attempt to prop up the White Army worked, Byrant would've been completely correct. What this really shows, is that predictions of the future rarely works out. 

As @Matt pointed out in the comments, so-called religious wars in history were almost always also motivated by economical and political concerns. The First Sacred War is no exception here. 

(Click to enlarge - shamelessly stolen from here.) While Australia is not as far from New Zealand as the latter is from Tahiti, the ancestors of the Maori found a relatively vast virgin land when they reached New Zealand. There would have been no more population pressure to migrate further, as had been the case in the much smaller islands of the Polynesian heartland. Due to their self-sufficiency, and with New Zealand being too isolated to maintain contact with the homeland, the Maori also ceased long range travel altogether. Another thing to note is that by the time the Polynesians began exploring the Pacific, the early Australians have inhabited their continent for tens of thousand of years. While there are evidence of more recent cultural contact, for example the introduction of the dingo to Australia (perhaps 10,000 to 5,000 years ago), nothing is known about any such relations. Hence, when early Polynesians reached Melanesia, they found it already occupied, and moved along eastward, thereby missing Australia altogether. The first recorded instance of Maori presence in Australia dates to the 1790s, when some chiefs began visiting Sydney. It was a start of a budding commercial relationship and they befriended Samuel Marsden, an early missionary to New Zealand. They, or other chiefs in subsequent visits, may well have met Aboriginal Australians. Unfortunately, 2,000 kilometres is no small distance. Europe also lost all contact with Greenland. 

But ultimately this is all quite speculative, and there are competing theories that the Peleset originated in Anatolia or Cyprus. 

Pyke's ideas won the support of Lord Louis Mountbatten, then head of British Combined Operations. However, he felt British resources were stretched too thin for such a project. Instead, Mountbatten offered the proposal to the American General George Marshall, and secured American commitment - despite poor reception by the Pentagon's analysts once Marshall brought the idea home. It was also at Mountbatten's instigation, when he arrived in Washington D.C. later on 9 June, that Robert Frederick was given command of the unit. Operation Plough was now rapidly turning into a reality, so Mountbatten then took Frederick and Pike with him to enlist the Canadians. Great Britain might not have the resources to participate, but the nature of the unit made the Dominion of Canada an obvious candidate for representing the British Commonwealth. 

Lithuania fell under Soviet occupation in 1940, but the Soviets were promptly evicted by Operation Barbarossa. So in practice, the Lithuanian SSR was established only in late 1944, after the Baltic Offensive. It would have been stranger for Moscow to entrust East Prussia to this fledgling government, who would've had their hands full setting up shop in Lithuania. For reference, Memel was later returned to Lithuania in 1948. So the question is probably, why not transfer the rest of the exclave after the dusts have settled? Well, as you noted in the question, Crimea was transferred to Ukraine only in 1954, under Khrushchev. What you might not be aware of is that a similar offer was made to give Kaliningrad to Lithuania. However, the Lithuanian leader Antanas Sniečkus had the foresight to decline. By then, the German population had been expelled and replaced with Russian colonists. The Lithuanians wisely refused to adopt a large, and potentially problematic, minority. See for instance, the troubles faced by Ukraine today. 

Though these were military production, the innovations in machine tooling and production methods occurred in lockstep with private industry. Furthermore, many surplus or captures military weapons were repurposed for sale to civilian markets in this period. By the end of the 1800s, the Boer farmers of South Africa were going head to head with the British Empire equipped with breechloaders. Nonetheless, the relatively lower cost and convenience of both gun and ammunition for muzzleloaders allowed it to preserver in some capacity. Not to mention its popularity today in the form of replicas. 

This doesn't really have anything to do with walls, but some nomadic tribes were forced westward during the Han Dynasty. Under the jingoistic Emperor Wu in particular, Han armies launched several expeditions deep into the steppes between 133 to 119 BC. A period of peace followed as the overexerted Han Empire found itself teetering on the brinks of collapse, but open warfare resumed after 103 BC. By 71 BC, the Han empire had clearly prevailed. It is often suggested that some (but not all!) of the defeated Xiongnu tribes fled westward. One popular theory is that this created the Huns. Whether true or not, any move west would have had almost nothing to do with the Great Wall, except that it was extended to help safeguard conquests. Furthermore, this occurred during a period of great Roman strength. It is quite dubious to say that the Xiongnu being driven west caused the fall of Rome on the other end of Eurasia, some 400 years later. At any rate, many Xiongu groups simply surrendered to the Han. They took an early and active role in the subsequent uprising in AD 304 mentioned earlier. 

Somewhat tellingly, two thirds of Chinese POWs in Korea opted to defect to Taiwan, the last bastion of Nationalist China, rather than return to the Communist mainland. 

The claim is true if we take "Italian" as meaning modern standard Italian. At the time of Italy's unification, what we know today as "Italian" was more of a literary language than a vernacular one. The 2.5% figure cited is a lower bound figure, but the higher end only goes up to 12% or so. Either way, only a small minority of Italy's inhabitants spoke it. That's because what we call "Italian" was only one of many descendants of the ancient Latin language. In fact, modern standard Italian was merely Florentino, a dialect of the Tuscan language spoken in Tuscany. In other regions of Italy, multiple different languages (some Romance, some not) dominated. Understandably, and unsurprisingly, few common folk outside of Florence and the city's hinterland spoke the Florentine dialect when it was chosen to be the national language in 1861. Florentino's adoption as the Italian national language reflects Florence's cultural prestige. Notably, Florence native Dante, called the Father of the Italian Language composed his works in that language. His Divine Comedy helped established Florentine as the literary language of Italy, a statue enhanced by other literary giants writing in Florentine. This however did not replace the local vernacular language of each region. Even today, regional languages are still quite alive on the Italian peninsula: 

A curious lapse had they intended the numbers to be meaningful. As experienced national leaders, Churchill and Stalin were not naive enough for this to be an accident. In fact, it's evident from the way Churchill referred to the agreement that he considered the the percentages to essentially be only for show. As he remarked in 1956: 

The Articles of Confederation deliberately engineered a weak central government. Congress could neither coerce the States into paying, nor punish them for their failure to do so; and its attempts to remedy the situation were easily thwarted. Proposals to realise a revenue from tariffs were single handedly shutdown by Rhode Island, for example. Ultimately, the confederation was in a state of financial disrepair because it was so weak.
