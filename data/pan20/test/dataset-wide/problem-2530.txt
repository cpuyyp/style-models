Teach and practice the Dhamma and encourage others to practice as well, just like how the Ariya-sangha would do. 

Yes, it is ok since you are simply voicing your opinion against corruption. Your motive is not to divide people. But it is not ok, if you are putting the people who follow you in harms way, just to serve your political agenda. 

A dollar bill dropped on the stairs may not qualify as an abandoned object or an object without an owner like "wild berries in the woods". Money is almost always owned by someone. People don't usually abandon it on purpose. The owner might not care too much, if it's just a dollar. But if it's a large amount, he or she could be so worried and looking for it already. So you could practice compassion and look for the owner. Alternatively, you could simply think of it as something you didn't earn or something that does not belong to you and walk away. If it starts troubling you or if you start worrying whether the next person will pick it up, you are already clinging to it. Think of it as a problem you didn't have until you saw it and let go. 

It is simply saying that you should not cling to people as clinging causes suffering. What you practice towards friends and family are Kindness(Metta), Compassion(Karuna), Sympathetic Joy(Mudita), Equanimity(Upekkha). They are called the 4 divine abidings. Craving and clinging are not required to have a friendship. 

You don't need to have sex to be healthy and well. Otherwise, most Buddhist monks should be sick. Cheating breaks the 3rd precept. That is bad Karma for you. Whether your wife agrees or not, associating with prostitutes has many bad consequences. You and your family's reputation can be tarnished. Higher risk of catching diseases. Your wealth will decrease. You could be cheated in many ways as you have very little idea about the character of the other person. You could be blackmailed by those who get to know about your habit. Most of all, your lust will increase. After sometime, you will start developing unnatural sexual cravings. There's no end to it, if you crawl down that pit. Nevertheless, sexual pleasures are not forbidden for lay people. So, as a Buddhist layman, you have several decent options available: 

Namo Buddhaya. One very important aspect which has not been said in the answers so far is that cessation of Dukkha can not be achieved if the Kamma has not been exhausted.Suffering can not affect those who have done no bad deed. By developing loving kindness,compassion,altruistic joy and equanimity one can liberate the mind from past kamma. It leads to non-returning or Nirvana. I quote the following sutta to support the answer: 

Every internal sense organ comes along with corresponding external organ. For example eye comes along with form, ear comes along with sound, nose comes along with smell , mind comes along with mental phenomenon. I am aware of the meaning of form or sight , sound , smell etc .. but I am not sure what is meant by mental phenomenon? When eye and form/sight come together eye consciousness arises. When nose and smell come to together nose consciousness arises. In both the statement above it is clear from my experience what is sight and smell. But when we say mind and mental phenomenon come together mind consciousness arises, it is not clear from my experience ,what is the mental phenomenon? Is mental pehnomenon the memory of past or the simulation of future or is it the dream or is it the speech ? There are different types of tastes ,colors ,odours, touch etc... Are there different types of mental phenomenon also? 

My question is: How did the suffering of Gautama Buddha(no matter how small) arise or co-arise? My guess is that with incomplete cessation of ignorance came incomplete cessation of fabrications. From incomplete cessation of fabrications came incomplete cessation of consciousness. From incomplete cessation of consciousness came incomplete cessation of name-form. From incomplete cessation of name-form came incomplete cessation of six sense media. From incomplete cessation of six sense media came incomplete cessation of contact. From incomplete cessation of contact came incomplete cessation of feeling. From incomplete cessation of feeling came incomplete craving. From incomplete cessation of craving came incomplete cessation of clinging/sustenance. From incomplete cessation of clinging/sustenance came incomplete cessation of becoming. From incomplete cessation of becoming came incomplete cessation of birth. From incomplete cessation of birth came incomplete cessation of aging ,death ,sorrow,pain , distress. I am not saying that Buddha was ignorant but that there is a possibility that there are levels of ignorance which one needs to transcend like the levels of jhanas. 

Technically, watching porn doesn't break the 3rd precept, but it weakens it. In other words, it weakens the merits you gain by keeping to the precept apart from accumulating bad karma. 

Yes, that's right. Happiness, loving kindness, hatred, jealousy, craving etc. belong to this group Vinnana(Consciousness) 

We can use the word 'god' or 'higher-god' to refer to brahmas, but that doesn't clearly separate them from Devas who belong to the sensual world. Is there a better English word? P.S. I'm inclined to think that there's no proper English term because the Western world did not have the practice of attaining Jhanas. Thus no concept of Brahma realms or non-sensual realms. 

Enlightened beings help others due to compassion. Compassion(Karuna) is a virtuous mind state. When someone becomes enlightened, he only cuts off unwholesome mind states. Virtuous mind states continue to arise. 

You can pick anything other than what is forbidden under Samma Ajiva of the Noble Eightfold Path. Here are few options: 

There's no such thing as "Electromagnetic energy" from a Vipassana(insight) meditator's point of view in Buddhism. It's all just seeing, hearing, smelling ,tasting, touching, thinking. 

Reality is that which stays the same when you try to subdivide. They are called Paramatta Dhammas. Perception is that which changes when you subdivide the supposed object it points to. ex: Table is a perception. If you break it into pieces, it becomes a pile of wood. It's not a table anymore. Man is a perception. If you pile up the bones and flesh separately, it's not a man anymore. 

Being capable enough to chase away a crow is enough to be ordained as a novice. So, yes! Keep in mind that you don't have to make youtube videos or preach to large audiences, just because you get ordained. You could simply stay in a forest or monastery, meditating. Wanting to be recognized can cause a lot of depression in a person. Work on giving up that need. 

Yes, it is against the first precept since it kills. What you can do is, instead of giving money, buy normal nets and mosquito repellent lotion and donate. 

It is true that there is no permanent identity of self and there is no identity of self which doesn't result in suffering. Nirvana is permanent , full of blessings, and is unchangeable. We humans can reach to the state of Nirvana by following the Buddha and his Dhamma. So my question is : Why can not we call Nirvana the true self of ours? (As an example I can say that I am not form,feelings,perceptions,volition,consciousness but I am the permanent , pleasant and unchangeable state of Nirvana) 

Understanding Anatta is easy but living it is difficult. I can tell you in which ways you are not experiencing Anatta. If you are identifying body as yourself or as your's then you are not experiencing Anatta. If you are identifying feelings as yourself or as your's then you are not experiencing Anatta. If you are identifying perceptions as yourself or as your's then you are not experiencing Anatta. If you are identifying consciousness as yourself or as your's then you are not experiencing Anatta. If you are identifying volitional formations as yourself or as your's then you are not experiencing Anatta. In order to experience Anatta you must NOT identify with Body, Feelings , Perceptions,Consciousness and Volitional formations as yourself or as your's. We do that by applying mindfulness. Here I quote from DN 22: 

I think I have found one answer to the question in Manual of Buddhism by Hardy Spencer. I quote from p.364: 

In Mudita meditation or Joy Meditation I am supposed to experience Joy for all beings. But I don't know which aspect of living beings is worth celebrating. My question is : How should I express Mudita or Joy for all beings? EDIT: To support my mental dilemma I quote Maiterya. 

No. Animals can not become Buddha. Even if an elephant or any other animal regulates his life right ,he will not attain insight into the Truth. To quote from Questions of King Milinda: 

How are the aggregates affected by a person's becoming enlightened or more enlightened? As far as I understand , for an enlightened mind the aggregates will cease to exist because the mind will no longer cling to the aggregates. Because with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence … cessation of birth … aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. The cessation of this whole mass of suffering will happen. This includes cessation of forms, feelings,perceptions, consciousness and volitional formations. How does "mindfulness" affect the aggregates, what's the change (in the functioning of each aggregate) depending on whether or not you're being mindful? To be mindfully aware of not clinging to the aggregates(as long as they are present) is mindfulness. Logically for a mindful person aggregates will cease to exist once enlightenment is achieved. Is this a wrong question -- were/are the "aggregates" only taught in the context of their being something inconstant and not worth attaching to? Aggregates are taught with reference to getting rid of the idea of self which is present in most of us. Conceiving self is like a disease and a person conceives self through the aggregates. Aggregates are taught in this context. I have tried to answer logically based on whatever I have learned till now. Hope this helps. 

Apart from that, the Buddha visited the Thawthisa heaven, seven years after his enlightenment to preach the Abhidhamma to his former mother and the other Devas and Brahmas. He spent three months there. He also visited a country called Sunaparanta with four hundred and ninety nine arahants, including venerable Kundadhana and venerable Ananda. 

If you want to know the truth about reality, you have to learn how to make impartial observations of nature. When you ask questions like "Who is waking up? Who is witnessing?", you have already made the assumption that there is an entity involved. The moment you do that, you drift away from reality and the experiment becomes biased. It's the same as asking "Who is making it rain? Who is making the sun rise from the east? Who is making the fruits fall to the ground?". To take an example, if you impartially analyse the experience of seeing, you wouldn't be asking the question "who is seeing?". You would ask something like "what are the different aspects of seeing?". That question does not add anything assumed/fabricated/artificial to the test environment. Then you will notice a physical aspect and a mental aspect to the experience that took place. Physical aspect is the light, eye and the mental aspect is the awareness of it. Upon further investigation, you will notice that these experiences do not just happen magically. You will notice that they arise due to causes. You will notice that the awareness aspect of the experience is also something that arises due to causes and that it is impersonal. Likewise, if you want to know reality, throw all of the assumptions out of the window and take each experience as it is. If you do not hypothesize or fabricate, the truth will reveal itself. 

The usage of the word 'self' in a conventional sense is the same as the usage of the word 'chair'. There's nothing intrinsic in the material it is made of that makes a chair a chair. But the usage of concepts are useful in day to day life for the purpose of identifying functions. 

Buddha corrects wrong way to mindfulness of death. But as far as I see , a person who wishes to live as long as it takes to chew and swallo a single mouthful , is same as a person who wishes to live as long as as it takes to chew and swallow ....The translator of the text failed to point out the difference between the mendicant's way of mindfulness of death and Buddha's way of mindfulness of death. I will thankful if someone could explain this sutta in its true essence. My question is :How should one be mindful of death? 

Namo Buddhaya. In this vast ocean of knowledge I haven't gained much knowledge. There are five aggregates, namely form,feeling,perception,volitional formations and consciousness.If I am not wrong, the aggregates are called aggregates because they are the sum total of many heterogenous things taken together. I am asking a very basic question here: What are these aggregates made up of? 

Namo Buddhaya. Sabbe Dhamma Anatta. Form is Anatta too. Meaning form is not worth identifying as myself, me or mine. Does that mean that I should identify myself as formless ? Am I in form or am I formless or I do not exist ? Similarly for feelings and consciousness. Should I identify myself feelingless? Should I identify myself consciousless( i.e. I will become without consciousness) ? I am pretty confused. 

Yes and remember Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha.Give up your belongings and be grateful that he did not hurt you. If he hurts you be grateful that he did not kill you. 

Namo Buddhaya. This sutta asks for development of 7 factors of enlightenment including Mindfulness and Equanimity. Development of Mindfulness is described in detail but I couldn't find any sutta describing development of Equanimity. My question is : Can you please suggest a sutta which describes how to develop Equanimity ? 

I am riddled by this question lately and it necessary for my progress on path of Dhamma. My question is, why is it that in this life time I have became obsessively bent to attain nibbana while everyone around me is living in total oblivion. Society is by and large enslaved by Mara the evil one. This answer explains in detail. Don't go by the society. I mean if I had so many rebirths in past lives exactly what was I doing all these quantillion lives, was I never told the dhamma. If I was told, then why am I not already enlightened. Was I dumb or something all these lives not to have awaken to the truth of suffering? You were and are under the influence of Mara as is almost everyone. Do you think Steve Jobs was dumb , Bill Gates is dumb or Einstein was dumb ? No. Even the smartest of people fail to get the insight. What must have been my mistake all these lives? How can I rectify that mistake so that I can felicitate my nibbana in this life? Yours and everyone's mistake is that they haven't renounced the self and the world. They still think that the eyes is theirs. They still still think ears is theirs. They still think body is theirs. They still think Mind is theirs. When in actuality it all belongs to Mara. To rectify the mistake ,I guess the best way would be to, renounce the world and walk the path which Buddha laid.
