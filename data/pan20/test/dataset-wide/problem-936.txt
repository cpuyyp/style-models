There are unusual cases with no (or only) organic matter, or with so little iron that iron oxides don't give color, in which case we see the underlying minerals, which can also have varying redox states. 

Do you have another source of seeds, or are you hoping to get all the seeds to jump-start agriculture from processed food in a grocery store? If the latter... a lot of our processing kills seeds while sterilizing food. Often we remove the seeds in the first place. For instance, I rarely see bell-pepper seeds in frozen sliced bell pepper, or tomato seeds in sauce. There are seeds in frozen okra, but okra is a hot-climate plant, I don't know if its seeds survive freezing. There might be whole flax and sesame seeds in granola that could still sprout. I think you should put a damp paper towel somewhere warm and test things as you find them in the grocery. 

"Proteins" isn't even consistent with the rest of the sentence in that quotation! It isn't principally protein. I think that paragraph is a paraphrase of the relevant paragraph from Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils, a standard introductory textbook, ยง4.1: 

Soil loses net carbon when disturbance stops carbon fixation but does not stop carbon respiration. Carbon is fixed into organic material by photosynthesis, mostly by plants; carbon respiration is when organic material rots or is eaten, as described by communitys. Undisturbed soils have fluxes of carbon both in and out almost all the time. Most human disturbances reduce photosynthesis, so "disturbed soils release carbon" is an adequate shorthand. For instance, plow agriculture that keeps soil bare of plants for a significant part of the year; or moving piles of soil around for construction, or diverting streams and groundwater so that plants die of drought, or simply paving over soil. Natural disturbances can do the same. As ecosystems mature on undisturbed soil, they tend to become more efficient at capturing energy and retaining limiting nutrients and therefore gain biomass, including soil organic material (SOM). SOM not only literally contains nutrients, but is a micro-environment that buffers nutrients, buffers water, and supports microbes that help plant roots flourish, which is why agriculture benefits from increased SOM. Even in wild environments, leaching eventually reduces the soluble nutrients and reduces total biomass (see Vitousek & Reiners, 1975, and a lot of Vitousek's later work). The leaching takes long enough that it's also an adequate shorthand to say that undisturbed soils will accumulate soil carbon. 

This answers one of the questions you list, but the shallowest seamount, per this list on Wikipedia is Banua Wahu, which is 8 meters below the surface, but has risen above the surface and fallen below the surface several times in recorded history. However, this is definitely not the tallest seamount, standing only 400m high from its base. Edit A larger database by Yesson, C et al. includes several seamounts that are within 2 meters of the surface. However, the data does not suggest when the measurements were taken (high tide or low tide), which would have obvious implications. Also, there are many seamounts within that range (I stopped counting at 100). 

The mention that species whose adults live within plankton were completely wiped out. This differential extinction is somewhat suggestive of a GRB. Summary Ultimately, there's not a clear and definitive link to a Gamma Ray Burst as the sole or primary source of this extinction event. However, there are some correlations. In the author's words, 

The answer that you're asking is within the paper that you cited in the question: Did a gamma-ray burst initiate the late Ordovician mass extinction? (Melot et al). Specifically the section titled "ASPECTS OF THE LATE ORDOVICIAN MASS EXTINCTION POTENTIALLY COMPATIBLE WITH A GRB". But if you're looking for an article summary, here is the evidence they mention that may point to a Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) as a possible source of the extinction: Rapid global cooling followed by rapid global warming Specifically, they say that a GRB may cause the production of NO2, which will increase the opaqueness of the atmosphere, causing cooling. Some species impacted more than others They mention that this may have happened, but that they would expect: 

Since you're looking for a list, you could investigate each of those technologies above. However, the one instrument not mentioned above and the most high recommended method is simply using geological maps. 

Source: Black Tusk, Wikimedia Commons The entire Intermontane Plate was subducted under the North American plate. However, we are able to see the remnants of the plate in the volcanic islands it left behind. Once this Intermontane Plate was subducted, the Insular Plate became the new subduction zone. This entire process was actually repeated with the Insular Plate, subducting the entire plate, leaving behind yet another chain of volcanic islands that fused to the western coast of the North American Plate. The Burke Museum has an excellent article that describes the subduction of both the Intermontane Plate and the Insular Plate. Well worth the read. 

There are two stages to what you want here. 1. Converting point data to gridded data First off, since you want to plot regular cells rather than the actual data that you have, you need to covert your point data to cells in some way. The best way to do this may depend on the data itself, but one way would be to interpolate, perhaps using something along the lines of, 

userLTK has explained that not all of the ice in the Antarctic stays frozen all the time. But perhaps there's a more basic view needed : sunlight in temperate areas melts all of the ice quite quickly, so why doesn't the same happen in Antarctica? There are a number of reasons, but the simplest (and probably most important?) is one of geometry, and the way that sunlight reaches parts of the planet's surface. Imagine that you are shining a torch onto a ball, where the beam from the torch is circular and much smaller than the ball. 

The linked paper does numerical modelling of a hypothetical tsunami and predicts speeds between 60 m/s (at its point of origin) and 30 m/s (nearer to shore). We can try a back-of-an-envelope approximation to see if we get close, and to understand why the speed would be so much lower than on Earth. A tsunami behaves as a gravity wave with a very long wavelength. In shallow water (and pretty much anywhere in Earth's oceans counts as shallow water for such a long wave), the speed at which it moves is approximated by $$V = \sqrt{gD}$$ where $V$ is the wave's speed, $D$ is the depth, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, $g = 9.81$ m/s2 and, in the deep ocean, we might assume a depth of 4 km and obtain a speed of 198 m/s, or 713 kph. Let's try this for Mars. As you've identified, the acceleration due to gravity on Mars is about 3.8 m/s2, and the linked paper gives assumed depths of the ocean on Mars as between 100 and 1200 m (forgive me if this is not quite right - I've only skimmed the paper, and these figures come from Table 1). Let's assume a 1000 m depth, since the highest speeds will be found in deep water: $$ V = \sqrt{ 3.8 \times 1000 } = 61.6\ \textrm{m/s} $$ which is close enough to their value for comfort. So a tsunami on the Mars described here would be much slower than on Earth due to the weaker force of gravity and the shallower depth of the ocean. 

The glacial buzzsaw hypothesis (summary; sample paper) is that mountains can't get much higher than the elevation at which glaciers form cirques. The upper walls of the cirques are steep and erode easily, which planes off the peaks above them, shortening the mountains. The evidence is, to summarize, that they don't get much higher than the cirques. Cirques are lower in higher latitudes. The highest possible mountain would therefore, I imagine, be near the equator and somewhere quite dry to minimize glaciation. But a very high mountain intrinsically alters global wind and weather patterns -- the Himalayas are sometimes called "the third pole". I don't know if you could have a dry, tallest-in-the-world mountain near the equator, no matter what plate tectonics was trying to do. 

The Italian Civil Defense's map of earthquake risk zones shows Rieti in at best Zone 2, "Medium-high seismicity, quite strong earthquakes possible", and near or in Zone 1, "High or catastrophic seismicity, strong earthquakes possible". The map of recent earthquakes in Rieti shows regular earthquake activity. Last year an earthquake killed hundreds in Rieti. There was a famous long legal case in Italy over earthquake predictions and warnings. 

There are two main problems that "wear out" soil, and people working on this deal with both of them. A soil might be low in organic matter and nitrogen, perhaps because all the crops were sold away and the topsoil eroded off. This would also happen on a new sandbank, or where a landslide had revealed a lot of subsoil. Naturally what happens is that the site is colonized by "primary succession" plants that are good at surviving there. These plants photosynthesize carbon compounds, and have bacteriological associates that fix nitrogen out of the atmosphere. The plants and bacteria live and die and leave detritus that slowly turns into richer soil, and somewhat more complex "secondary succession" plants move in. Reclamation agriculture or reforestry helps this along, and agroforestry tries to forestall soil loss by growing trees instead of arable crops. But C and N are not all that plants and bacteria are made of -- just about everything else, eg P and K and Mg and Ca, comes from the geological parent material of the soil. When as anions and cations these elements are being traded and fought over by plants and microbes, they are soluble, and over time they will weather out of the soil. Over geological time they weather out of the underlying rock, which is the problem in the oldest parts of the Earth, and then it's difficult for even primary succession plants to grow. Hawaii is a beautiful natural laboratory for this, as the islands are made of the same lava but are of very different ages. The classic work on this is by Vitousek; here's an open access paper following up on it: Primary Succession on a Hawaiian Dryland Chronosequence. There's a ecology-economy group trying to fix this problem in Haiti. Haiti has exported so much, for historical reasons, that their soil is terrible and they have to import a lot of food although they were recently a very NPP-productive place. SOIL works on designing and introducing composting toilets so that the elements imported as food are incorporated into agricultural soil instead of running off (causing public health and fisheries problems as they go!). It's a very nice virtuous-circle, though it takes a lot of work to keep it going. 

The largest database of seamounts contains over 33,000 seamounts and was created by Yesson, Chris; Clark, MR; Taylor, M; Rogers, AD. Link For their list, they defined seamounts and knolls as 

We know that plates can subduct, causing one plate to be pushed into the core by another. As the plates move, the subduction continues, pushing one plate under the other. If this process continues, logic says, the entire plate could be subducted under the other. Has this ever happened? How would we know? 

The source for this answer is from a Nature.com article. However, they take their sources from the original research: 

[1] James P. Kossin - Is the North Atlantic hurricane season getting longer? GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 35, L23705, doi:10.1029/2008GL036012, 2008 James P. Kossin 

We had a surprising opportunity to study this very question during the period of September 11-14, 2001, when all air traffic was grounded across the United States. The research was inconclusive, but they found that there was a 1.8 degree celsius increase across the US during this time frame compared to the three days before and after that time frame. However, this shift may have been coincidental. It was found by others that this temperature shift was within the normal range for the time of year. Ultimately, the question of whether these high-level clouds impact the weather and temperatures is still an open debate. 

In their paper, they set the definition of a seamount as a sub-surface feature, not breaking the water. This puts the highest elevation in their dataset is 2m below sea level. The pulled their definition from Morato, et al (2008), which states: "seamounts are defined as any topographically distinct seafloor feature that is at least 200 m higher than the surrounding seafloor, but which does not break the sea surface." Then, they subdivided the features into knolls and seamounts at an heigh of 1km (with knolls being between 200m and 1km in height). So, specifically answering the question, that databases uses the Morato, et al (2008) definition, which excludes super-surface seamounts. 

They go on to say that both of these patterns "may exist". Differential extinction They probably say this best: 

The hurricane season is set by the National Hurricane Center. They use statistics to determine the dates. Specifically: 

Excellent question! Indeed, entire plates have subducted before. One example is the Intermontane Plate (Wikipedia). This plate sat west of North America around 195 million years ago. The plate contained a chain of volcanic islands on its western edge (known as the Intermontane Islands). As the plate subducted under the North American plate, that island chain stood too tall and merged with the North American plate. An illustration of the plate:
