The Silk Road was very secure during the peak of the Mongolian Empire, basically the early 13th to 15th centuries. Most of it was subsumed in Mongol controlled territory, and the movements of troops along or around it also acted as a "policing" mechanism. Prior to the Mongols, the nearly-as-ferocious Turks maintained the security over most the Silk Road. During times when there was no "dominant power," bandits and robbers were a real problem, as pointed out in other answers. At such times, only relatively short "stretches" of the roads, between nearby cities, were reasonably safe, and most of the shipping took place over those stretches in "relays." People that went beyond those relatively safe stretches really "paid their money and took their chances." 

In June 1864, as General (later President) Ulysses S. Grant was leading the Army of the Potomac against Richmond, Lee DID order an offensive by one of his better remaining subordinates, General Jubal Early. $URL$ Early debouched from the Shenandoah Valley, cut a swath across Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and threatened Washington. But the South had few punches left after Gettysburg. They had reached their "high water mark" there, losing over 20,000 men, including several generals killed or wounded to no purpose. This, after the loss of 13,000, including that of General "Stonewall Jackson, at the previous battle of Chancellorsville. The day after Gettysburg, General Ulysses S. Grant had captured Vicksburg, Mississippi, establishing Union control of the whole Mississippi river, cutting off Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, plus the re-occupied states of Mississippi and Tennessee from the Confederacy. In effect, the latter was now fighting with only six states out of eleven. These victories soon led to the promotion of Grant to the de facto commander Army of the Potomac, who allowed the Confederates few openings to counter invade the north. The previous invasions had followed Union defeats at the Second Battle of Bull Run (ending at Antietam), and the battle of Chancellorsville, prior to Gettysburg. 

MOST countries' kings practiced "Diplomacy by marriage." Austria stood out by making it work. That's because her kings' marriages seemed to be highly topical, rather than random. For instance, there didn't seem to be much of a point for Maximilian of Austria to marry Marie of Burgundy. Until you realize that Austria is on the southeast edge, and Burgundy/Netherlands was on the northwest edge of the Holy Roman Empire, and Maximilian was likely to (and became) Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage of Maximilian and Marie's son Philip to Ferdinand and Isabella's daughter Juana didn't seem to make much sense either, until you realize that Spain and the Netherlands were on the south and north of their common enemy, a newly united France. A couple generations later, the marriage of Austria's Prince Ferdinand to the heiress of Bohemia didn't seem to have to particular meaning, until one realizes that it enabled Austria, Bohemia, and the Holy Roman Empire to split off from Spain and the Netherlands (the latter two under Philip II). On the other hand, the marriage of Philip II of Spain to England's Queen Mary didn't do much for either, except to arouse antagonisms on both sides. And the marriages of various French kings to Polish princesses didn't do much for France, because Poland was a liability, rather than an asset to France, given all her enemies. The marriages of French Louis (XIII and XIV) to Spanish princesses didn't reconcile these natural enemies. 

The Act tended to phase out feudalism. Specifically, it replaced taxes on land with excise taxes on the products of land, specifically alcohol (the highest value added product produced from grains). Suppose the target revenue was £100,000, while the value of all the alcohol produced each year was £1,000,000. in this example, the excise rate would be 10%. Of course this would work only if the net proceeds to the landlord after the excise tax were still higher than the value of the next highest use. But that's why they chose alcohol (salt in France). Under feudalism, lords had paid fixed annual rates for the land, either in money, or in "serjeanty" (services provided by their peasants). If you were a peasant, the new Act would lower your rents and serjanty obligations, because the king would no longer be collecting a share of them. Whether or not you would be better off depended on your consumption of alcohol (or lack thereof), because this "crown rent" was replaced by a tax on alcohol. 

The question isn't about what would have happened in that event. It is: Have one or more recognized historians delved into this question (of what would have happened if Britain had surrendered to or collaborated with Germany under another leader than Churchill)? What were the findings of their inquiries? (In "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich," William L. Shirer hypothesizes that the relationship between occupier and occupied would have been a hostile one, but doesn't go into what the implications would have been for war itself.) 

At least two major events in the past 25 years led to the rise of China as a superpower. The first was the collapse of the Soviet Union (then the number two power) in 1991. This created a power vacuum with the United States as a clear number one, but room for other possible number twos (Japan, Germany or China). the second event was China's joining the World Trade Organization in 2002, and thereafter exerting her influence (with the largest number of people in the world) on world trade. Once China abandoned her former isolation, her rise was only a matter of time. The current decade is when she hit "critical mass." 

The war aims (and implied post war plan) for Germany in the Soviet Union was based on the so-called Archangel-Astrakhan, or AA Line. Germany wanted the most desirable, industrialized parts of the Soviet Union west of this line, representing over 80% of the country's original population and industrial capacity. Hitler was satisfied to "allow" (relocate) the Soviets a country east of that line. That would have been a Vichy-like settlement, with the Soviets being more remote, and hence having more autonomy, than the Vichy government, but probably forbidden to do some things like make alliances with other countries. 

Generals will order their soldiers to "fight to the death" only when there is a military or political advantage to be gained. This was not the case here. At the Alamo, some 174 Texans defended a fort to the death and inflicted several hundred casualties (a multiple of their own number) on the Mexicans. This weakened Santa Anna to the point where he could not pursue the main Texas force under Sam Houston until he received reinforcements. Houston also received reinforcements and won the battle of San Jacinto. A similar story could be told for say, the "fight to the death" defense of Stalingrad, to buy time for the encircling forces. In the case of the Confederates, they had just been ousted from their fortified positions around Richmond, which was the Confederate capital. Half starved soldiers were fleeing west on foot, many without shoes. There were only about 30,000 left from an original strength of over 60,000. (And the decline in Confederate strength was more than 50% because many of these men were replacements for fallen veterans, supported by limited ammunition and almost no artillery.) Their objective was Lynchburg, which supposedly offered them food and transportation to the mountains where there was at least a hope of a guerrilla resistance. Neither was present there, and the Confederates were caught in open country, outnumbered four to one, (not the earlier two to tone, in fortified positions), with hordes of Union cavalry ready to cut down any stragglers or "escapees" from the main fight. Under the circumstances, a "fight to the death" would have been suicide, without the chance of winning or even inflicting meaningful casualties. In 1864, with his line broken at Spotsylvania, the same General Lee asked his men to "fight to the death" to close the breach at a place called the "Bloody Angle" by offering to personally lead the counterattack, to allow his engineers to build a new defense line. Their success prolonged the war almost a year. No such advantage offered itself around Lynchburg. 

Spanish influence didn't take root, at least in the modern Netherlands, because it was "unnatural." Belgium and the Netherlands represented the inheritance of Marie of Burgundy, who married Maximilian of Austria (and lost her native Burgundy to France after she did so). They had a son, Philip the Fair, who married Juana, the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain. The younger couple produced Charles V who inherited Spain from his maternal grandparents, and Austria plus Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as the title of Holy Roman Emperor from his father's side. When Charles V abdicated, his holdings were "redivided," with Austria and the Holy Roman Empire going to his brother Ferdinand, and Spain and the Netherlands, going to his son, Philip II in 1556. This was a mistake, because the quasi-Germanic Netherlands fit more naturally with Austria and the Holy Roman Empire. The northern, Protestant part of the Netherlands revolted against its new master, the King of Spain, ten years later, and basically did not wish to have anything to do with Spain, even when temporarily occupied. There was limited Spanish influence on the Spanish Netherlands (Belgium), because of their shared Catholic faith, and their common French enemy. 

The reputations of the two men had to do with their personal reputations, not their roles as kings. Richard was known as the lion-hearted, (Coeur de Lion). He was brave in battle, and magnanimous toward his enemies. He became the leader of the Crusades when others dropped out of the picture, and his reputation was known through all of Europe. He also made a brilliant cease-fire with the enemy sultan, Saladin that almost became a "love-fest." John was known as "John Lackland," because he was the youngest son who inherited the least from his father (until his brothers started dying off), a man with a inferiority complex and a chip on his shoulder. He was regarded as a coward in battle, a lecher around whom no one's wife or daughter was safe, and personally cruel; he ordered the torture-executions of a number people. As a king, Richard neglected and overtaxed his country for his personal (Crusades) glory. John (accidentally) gave England the Magna Carta and some personal liberty. It's not clear that Richard was the better king than John. But he was clearly the better man, and the two are remembered for the latter and not the former. 

One reason is that the French "Army" (its officers actually) looked up to a former general named the Marquis de Lafayette. He was a war hero who had fought for the Americans in the American Revolution, helping to defeat England, (France's arch enemy), and was firmly on the side of French Revolutionaries. Lafayette was a mediator that was trusted by both sides. At one point, he calmed revolutionary tensions by kissing the hand of Queen Marie Antoinette in public. 

One of the primary aims of the Government of India Act was to weaken the rising Indian governing class, specifically, the Congress Party. For instance, Burma was separated from India altogether, and a number of Indian provinces were subdivided for "gerrymandering purposes. The idea of having "separate but equal" electorates for the classes at the bottom was to give them a certain sop to their pride, while dividing them from other Indian classes. Other provisions of the Act were meant to cater to the Princes. These provisions didn't always achieve their intended purposes because the Indians were actually more united, (or at least less divided) against British rule than Britain thought. But they did represent the "rearguard" actions of a dying Empire. 

There were several reasons while Nepal, Bhutan, (and until recently, Sikkim), remained Independent of India. 1) The first was their remote, mountainous locations. That made it hard for Britain to occupy them, and the fierce soldiers of Nepal (the Ghurkas) were particularly prized by Britain. Basically, it was easier and more profitable for Britain to "deal" with them than conquer them. 2) The second reason (related to the first) was the power and sway of local warlords in these countries that made for the issues in 1) above; easy cooperation, hard conquest. Sikkim, the smallest of the three, was nominally independent until 1975. Its affairs had been managed by India but they maintained "administrative autonomy until civil strife brought them into the hands of India. 

That is to say, this imbalance was redressed by giving land to the newly ennobled. Germany had a similar concept going back as early as the turn of the first and second millennia, and it's possible that both that country and Italy inherited the idea from the Holy Roman Empire. It is noteworthy that in Britain, one way to noble titles was through military success (Duke of Marlborough, Duke of Wellington), although these titles were hereditary.But as another poster pointed out, it was possible to become a "life peer" (by late in the second millenium.)
