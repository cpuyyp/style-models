I find argument 2 naive to the extreme, and I think argument 3 somewhat strange. Of course the Soviet Union technically could have occupied all of Finland, Finland was a small country with few people, the Soviet Union a huge empire. But the Finnish resistance was much stronger than anticipated, and occupying Finland would have cost the USSR a lot of men, that was better used elsewhere. It's clear that the USSR decided that the cost of Finland was not worth it, so they instead made peace. I don't think that tells us anything about what their plans for Finland was, had they succeeded in occupying it. As such I think the weight of evidence falls clearly to the side that the USSR intended to annex Finland in the form of a USSR state, although it's unlikely we'll ever know for sure. 

It is a question of contacts. Where are you to move, and how? In general you move to where you have friends, contacts and where you can speak a language. And moving a long way with all your possessions is costly and takes time. 

The bible have contains two almost exact copies of the same text, one in 2 Kings 25 and one in Jeremiah 52. One of the differences is that Jeremiah says that commander Nebuzaradan arrived on the 10th day of the fifth month, and 2 Kings say he arrived on the 7th day. Neither gives an exact date for the destruction of the temple, they just say that he " He set fire to the temple of the Lord, the royal palace and all the houses of Jerusalem." The next date mentioned (only in 2 Kings) is "The seventh month", so presumably the destruction of the temple happened before that. So for all we know the destruction of the temple could have happened any time between the 7th of Av and up to two months later. However, Josephus refers to the date of Jeremiah, and says that the first temple was destroyed the 10th. And he also says that the second temple was destroyed the tenth. (Not the 9th as later tradition has it). In the quote you show he does reflect on this coincidence, and clearly wonders if it is true. So, what is he actually sceptical about? Does he doubt the claim that the first temple was destroyed the 10th? This is possible. He might after all be aware that another text claims the 7th. Does he doubt the claim that the second temple was destroyed the 10th? Wasn't he an eye-witness? Well, yes, he was, and he was Titus translator, and should have remained by his side. And this is what he says about the destruction: 

The events were written down by Ibn Ishaq, who unusually for historians of this time actually would write down who his sources were. From New Light on the Story of Banu Qurayza and the Jews of Medina by W. N. Arafat, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, (1976), pp. 100-107: 

Islam has traditionally not been big on forced conversion. Generally Muslim rulers have been OK with allowing other religions. Especially since non-Muslims often was made to pay extra taxes. The claim that Islam spread rapidly everywhere else there was Islamic rulers is not a really correct statement from that point of view. It took many hundreds of years there as well. I can't find any support for the position that conversion somehow was slower in India than in most other Islamic empires. 

What's that's supposed to mean? It only becomes comprehensible once you realize that this is an attempt to remake the earlier quote in a more older language. The thing is of course the Macaulay didn't make a speech in 1935, and his Minute on education does not contain the quote. It's quite obviously an attempt to render the original fake quote in an older language, but it's a very bad attempt. And even if it would have been a good attempt, it still begs the question why the quote first floated around the internet is a more modern version. 

0 meters, as the known world (that is, known by Europeans, which I assume you mean) already included parts of the "new world", ie Greenland and the coast of Canada. As for the distance between the "old world" (ie Afro-Eurasia) and the "new world" (ie the Americas), the Bering Straight is about 80 kilometers wide. However, very few people live either side of it, so that's not much use. (Unless you include islands, in which case Iceland straddles the mid-Atlantic ridge, which means Reykjavik is in America, but that's really stretching "New World"...) Other relevant distances: The distance between Iceland and Greenland is as little as 300 kilometers, and Icelanders were completely aware of Greenland at this time, but there wasn't much reason to go there. The last Norse people on Greenland probably died quite shortly before Columbus travels. The distance between Reykjavik and L'Anse aux Meadows, where there was a Norse settlement for a short time (probably just a winter) who were driven away by the native Americans, is about 2400 kilometers, which can be compared with the around 6900 kilometers Columbus traveled from Europe to land in America on his first voyage. I assume your question really is about "Could there have been some other easier way to discover America", and the answer is yes. And in fact it had been discovered at least twice before. Once by the people who first moved there about 13.000 years ago, and secondly by Leifr Eiríksson around the year 1000. 

There are plenty of examples of long-lost treasures being found, a viking silver hoard pops up in average once a year in Gotland, for example. I don't think there are any cases of anyone actually actively seeking one specific buried treasure finding the intended treasure, and definitely not involving any elaborate series of riddles, maps or traps. Who would be stupid enough to leave a trail when you hide a treasure? You know where it is. Lost treasures are instead generally found by pure luck, or by archaeological examinations of interesting features. There are however several cases of people looking for sunken ships with large treasures on them, and finding those shipwrecks. No riddles or traps involved though, but lengthy searches. The biggest of the treasures is probably the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, found in 1985 after 16 years of searching. 

It seems to me that most of the things you suggest Vercingetorix might have done is what he actually did. They did try to stop the circumvallation, but failed to make a noticeable impact. Once help arrived they tried to attack from both sides at once, also at night, which was close to succeeding. Of course, everything we know about this siege comes from Julias Ceasar himself, and as this almost successful attack was finally countered to a large part through Ceasar's personal bravery, he might have takes some license with actual facts.... :-) You can't exactly say that Vercingetorix tried a all out war of attrition, but it seems like a besieged city that are low on resources are doomed to lose any war attrition per definition.

The answer depends on what exactly you mean, and what vehicles we are talking about. So I'll restrict this answer to cars. (Airplanes is a completely different issue, if the Wright brothers had been shown a model of a F-117 and you had told them it was a future airplane they would probably have laughed at you). The ideas of aerodynamics go back a long way, and race cars quite early used primitive ideas of aerodynamics, like the 1899 land speed record holder La Jaimais Contente. However, the position of the driver outside the body and the exposed chassis likely undid most of the effect of the body. So there was an early understanding that aerodynamics was desirable, but not much knowledge of how to do it well. And that's one of the reasons early cars wasn't aerodynamic, people simply didn't know how to make them aerodynamic. When in 1914 an aerodynamic prototype was made of an A.L.P.H.A 40/60 the speed increase was 86 mph, compared with 78 mph for the standard model, this not only because of the bad understanding of aerodynamics, but also because the bodywork became much heavier. In addition to that, the technology to make modern aerodynamic bodies is likely to have been expensive or complicated. So to answer your questions: 

What I think happened here is a case of gradual exaggeration. Benito Mussolini, who started the Italian Fascist party, was a socialist. But he got kicked out of the socialist party for supporting Italian involvement in WWI. Since he was no longer in the socialist party, he started his own organization, which eventually became the fascist party. Although the opinions of the fascists and the socialists differed in several respects, most of the fascist ideology was simply socialism. Therefore the opinions of the fascists and the socialists was quite similar in many respects. A similar thing happened in Germany, where DAP, the German Workers Party, acquired some nationalist opinions and finally turned into NSDAP, the Nazi party. The discourse, propaganda, opinions and target interest groups of the socialists and the Italian fascists and German nazis was very similar, although the socialists emphasized class while the Italian fascists and German nazis emphasized the nation. The politics they proposed was also very similar. But by the time Mussolini actually formed the Fascist party, it was seven years since he was kicked out out the socialist party, and there was no reason for him to just take the socialist party's program and change it a bit. I also can find no support for this claim, and I think that would be more widely known if it was the case. So, no, they did not share the same electoral programme as far as I can figure out. I did find the 1920 program of PSI, and the 1921 program of PNF, and they are not the same at all. But that doesn't prove anything, you would have to compare the program of PSI for all it's years with the programs of the several socialist parties in Italy during all their years, and to do that you probably need to go to Italy. :-) 

Most people who are or want to be political leaders try to look like they love children, and children love them. The reason is very simple: Most adult people are parents. For almost all parents there is nothing more important in the world than their children. Hence, the best way to rise in the eyes of parents, and hence the best way to rise in the eyes of adults, is to look like you care about children. This way you look like someone who cares about the small, the helpless and the future all in one go. This is the reason for the ubiquitous "Baby kissing" of presidential candidates, this is the reason Nehru tried to portrait himself as every child’s "Uncle", and this is the reason Stalin portrayed himself as a protector of children. 

Notice how Cuba's life expectancy is increasing rapidly already before the revolution. The increased life expectancy under socialist rule can not be attributed to the revolution. In 1980, Life expectancy reached that of Italy. Then it started lagging. 

There are probably several reasons, and it's likely impossible to answer without writing a book, and most of the reasons are not political but has rather to do with economics. One of the major reasons is based in fundamental economics. The Bismarckian welfare state is based on social insurance, ie, the government pays for an insurance that the welfare recipient can use as they best see fit. The most clear example is in health care, where the Bismarckian health cases system has a tax-funded health insurance which you can use to pay for to a largely privately run health care system. This preserves competition and ensures efficiency better than the British system (often called the Beverige model), where the health care system is not funding individual health care, but instead funding state owned health care. This creates a monolithic bureaucratic system where the health care is overpriced. The result is typically that the rich pays for better private health-care, while everyone else are forced to endure long queues and waiting lists for operations, fueling resentment and dissatisfaction with the system. The second major reason is political, and that is that the unions in Britain used their power to a large extent to block change and economic reforms. When industry was going badly, the Unions would not accept changes as this would have resulted in cut downs, instead they striked to prevent the cut downs, which just resulted in companies shutting down completely. This resulted in a conflict between the unions who were unrealistically blocking reform, and the union-supported government who tried to make reforms and still keep the unions happy at the same time. This impossible situation and the resulting economic decline was then only reverted when a conservative government took over, as this government did not need nor want the support of the unions and went through with the economic reforms despite the unions opposition. Countries with similar situations to the UK (like Denmark and Sweden) saw similar development. Both Denmark and Sweden has also, like the UK, made many free-market reforms, and both are busy improving their health-care problems by moving the a Bismarckian system (but not the UK, yet).
