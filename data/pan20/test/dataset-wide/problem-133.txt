Start with a commodity or a commodity currency. This really goes without saying since the period doesn't yet have fiat currencies, it's either silver or gold. Gold is basically useless in this period apart from decoration or currency, and perhaps elves have different taste in decoration. Maybe the elves value good steel above gold because it's hard to get without destructive industry, just as Aluminium was once highly valued. However you approach this problem, to have two way trade you have to find something that both parties value. If you don't want two way trade then the glass beads used to trade with some primitive tribes could be the way to go. Decorative and rare to the tribes in question, but largely worthless to the explorers. 

The equivalent comparison is not about toxic substances, it's closer to shooting yourself with bullets of ever increasing size to build up tolerance, it's not going to work. The human body runs on electricity and is damaged by high flows. I'll leave you with the ever popular health and safety executive 

Different technologies become important. First up: Advertising This becomes the be all and end all for your internet profile. No advertising, no profile, no visitors to your website. With no searches to game, getting your name out there becomes a matter of paying someone to do it. This increases the value of advertisements on high traffic sites massively along with the value of going viral. Next up: The Index You'll need to index everything on your site. If you want a page to be found you'd better have good menus and an index, otherwise nobody will see it. I'm sure menus and site navigation were better in the days before internal site searching. Then there are the Yellow Pages type sites, that list every company that submits (and pays for) a listing. A website equivalent of the directory we used to get through the door, since Google took over their market the directory is a pale shadow of what it was (barely worth the effort of tearing in half). 

Here's some footage from the BBC of dorado and frigatebirds hunting flying fish. The dorado force the flying fish into the air, where the frigates catch them, the frigates scare them back into the water where the dorado catch them. The two predators are not directly competing as they don't share a medium of movement, and for each the presence of the other makes the hunt easier, as the prey can evade each one alone. 

Distinguishing between destroying the world and merely killing everyone on it. In short, yes there were certainly enough nukes to kill everyone several times over. New York Times: March 6, 1984 

Methods of "encouragement" used at the discretion of the Dear Leader. Too much education is a bad thing, it leads to rebelliousness in the population. A tendency to think for themselves, this should be discouraged. The majority of the population should be encouraged to be obedient. Greater glory to the nation. 

The problem with this idea is that it's self defeating You have a batch of students, naturally social creatures meeting new people and making friends as fast as they can. You induct them into a culture of mistrust and isolation. They move up a year and a new batch of students come along They're naturally social creatures making friends as fast as they can. They don't make friends with people in the older years because the older years have been inducted into the culture of isolation, so they don't naturally pass this culture down to the next generation. Every year you have to start from scratch, you're having to put a lot of work into it when you could just say, "examinations are competitive, only 50% of you will move up a year". To get a properly unhealthy culture in an environment you need to have a slower turnover than a university. It's much easier to do in a workplace. 

Your primary problem is cooling You will need a constantly cycling cooling system ideally with the ability to automatically top up lost coolant or holding such redundant levels of coolant that moderate losses are not catastrophic. I would advise using water as your primary coolant. Your concerns about buildup of biological matter can be resolved by the simple consideration of the temperature the system is going to run at. Anything short of extremophiles are going to be cooked off in short order. Since this is a nuclear facility a consideration for a cooling system that will survive unpowered, unmaintained, and unattended, for example in case of meltdown or earthquake making the building unsafe, could be a part of local regulation for building the yards in that country/state. Based on a scaled up thermosyphon* for example. While this approach is not entirely bullet proof in the very long run, its largely passive nature and lack of moving parts means that facilities that survive the war should survive a considerable period afterwards. Facilities will be lost, some will suffer leaks and be unable to recover sufficient water, or suffer earthquake or other damage and suffer catastrophic failure. The nature of a rail network means that while some depots will be lost, others will survive. 

You need to look at the social factors as well. Are you looking at a modern world with a middle class and people expecting a decent daily wage or a highly stratified feudal society with mages/lords at the top and everyone else basically serfs. If it's the former then it's one person with a team of horses. Simply a matter of cost. If the latter then peasants are cheap and don't need paying. Remember that serfdom wasn't abolished in Europe until the mid 19th Century. 

Your first problem is weight The bigger the "ship" the heavier is has to be to maintain its own structure. Anything big on soft sand is a nightmare. If you want them to move fast then give them kiteboards. Your second problem is wheels. Ideally you don't want wheels, moving parts and sand don't mix. They also focus all your weight down to a very small area. At low speeds on hard sand perhaps, at high speeds you want to be thinking skis. It's possible to ski/sandboard on softer sand than you can drive on, like the downwind side of dunes. In summary Lose the big multimast, make the 20man ships the big slow cargo carriers taking them down to a crew of 3. The bulk of the group should be kiteboarding for speed and maneuverability with maybe a few 2man land yacht types with skis alongside their wheels so they don't bog down too much. 

Disease It's going to be the wealthy and the already mobile who lead the way. They're going to try to stay safe in sealed enclaves but once a plague goes global the only way to truly quarantine yourself in a controlled environment will be to go to sea. A disease carried by just about any mammal but mostly only affecting humans would drive people off the land to stay safe. Only the suicidally brave or immune would risk going back to land to gather resources. 

Imagine if you will, a traveler from 300 years ago landing in our time. (I know this is a greater time than you're looking at but it's a good point in history for this.) This person is going to turn up with a few virus variants that we haven't seen for a while and will catch a few from us, but he could turn up with any of TB, Bubonic Plague or even Smallpox! To us these diseases are largely consigned to history or standard vaccination and treatment schemes but to them they were a part of life. What would your traveler be taking with him that the people of the future have consigned to history? Measles? Chicken pox? Polio? Things that should have been forgotten are now showing up because he traveled to the future. 

In perfectly uniform density over an infinite volume, yes, but this equilibrium is unstable. Any given point in an infinite volume of perfect uniformity is under no stress, effectively in the centre of an infinite shell. You have chosen a hard substance, rather than a gas which would be simpler, but the result is the same. The difference is that it's able to maintain a greater deviation from the perfect uniformity before the system breaks down. As soon as there's an edge or a distortion, anything that breaks that perfect uniformity to an extent greater than the structural strength of your material, then the equilibrium breaks down and the mass will start to bead up (form planets or, because this is a high density substance, form black holes). 

The effect is that it's painful to walk in flats. You could cause someone to be born with this, though it would normally be treated medically rather than through wearing stilettos.
