As I touched in the last paragraph of this answer, we don't really know who the Huns were. Its one of the great mysteries of history, up there with the identity of the Sea Peoples. It appears the initial idea that they were the same people as the Xiongnu in the Chinese records came from an 18th Century French historian who also argued that China was initially an Egyptian colony. His contemporary Gibbon repeated the former (thankfully not the latter!) idea in his seminal Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which was the English-language text on its subject for the next 200 years. The initial logic appears to been circumstantial: after their defeat by the Han, the Xiongnu were pushed westward out of the Chinese sphere into modern Khazakhistan. A mere three centuries later, the Huns suddenly appeared as players around the steppe north of the Caspian sea (400 miles to the southwest). There is some argument about whether the two names themselves would have been pronounced similarly. Some argue it would. There are some archeological similarities too (they both used the same kind of bronze pot, as did nearly everyone else on the steppe at that time). Sadly the Hunnic language is no help, as we have only have 3 recorded words, and some names to go by. IMHO that would be determinative, but barring some lucky find in a Sogdian library, we are not likely to find out any time soon. 

The author was working for the King of Portugal at the time. Given this as the state of the art of European cartographical knowledge in 1492, we can see that the intervening ocean was thought to contain numerous small islands. The Azores and Canaries and Cape Verde islands were known and depicted. In the East, Japan (Cipangu), Java and other "spice" islands of the SE Asian archipelago are depicted. There are some interesting "unknown" islands. There are several placed up in the arctic circle, perhaps as a nod to Iceland and its legends. There was also one island roughly the size of England smack dab in the middle of the ocean named "Saint Brandan". Likely this is a reference to the story of the Irish monk St. Brendon, who was said to have traversed the ocean and found an island paradise. The interesting thing about this is that it appears that this rather tall tale was apparently given much more credence in mainstream European thought than the Icelandic discoveries. Even there though, it was clearly just thought to be a large island, not an entire new continent. So it seems fair to say the folks in the best position to speculate, the Portugese navigational community, didn't think there was anything in the middle but islands. 

The Germ Theory of disease of course had not yet been developed at that time. It had to wait until the second half of the 19th century to get any scientific traction, and until a couple of decades into the 20th (when it saved the US's Panama Canal effort) before it became generally accepted. The typical theory before then was that diseases were caused by Miasma ("bad air", or "malaria" if you were Italian). This led the advisors of Pope Clement VI to suggest he wait out the plague in a room surrounded by torches. It appears to have been a team of scientists in 1894 investigating a Chinese outbreak from 30 years earlier who first identified Yersina Pestis. Historian Francis Gasquet appears to have been the initial champion for the idea that this was the same disease as the Black Plague, and (by 1908) that rats and fleas were the cause. The man had his detractors, but modern genetic studies of the remains of victims seem to back him up. 

Before we go away thinking warm fuzzy thoughts though, I feel compelled to point out that these conflicts all have something in common, but different than WWII: they were sold at least in part as the US helping out the country in question. They were not conflicts against a nation that was perceived to have the popular support of its own people there for its actions. The closest I believe the USA has seen to that was during the Iranian hostage crisis. I distinctly remember a lot of anti-Iranian feeling floating around back then, to the point where if I were Iranian, I certainly wouldn't have felt safe. Ratchet that up a few notches for an actual shooting war, and it may well not have been safe to be an Iranian walking around in public. At that point internment talk ("for their own safety") may start making sense to some people. 

The killings to which they are doubtless referring occurred as part of his ownership of the Congo Free State. They all happened in Africa, and the deaths seem to have been the result of a rather abusive form of slave labor that was employed to keep productivity there high. The wikipedia page says that estimates range from 2 to 14 million deaths, but there's really no certianty involved in those numbers, as no records were kept, and Congo in the 19th century wasn't eactly the kind of place prone to gather census figures. However, this was all completely aside from the fact that Leopold happened to be the king of a European nation. The CFS was owned by Leopold personally, and the profits went to enrich himself, not his country. That particular graphic seems to have taken a very high estimate and used it as an absolute number. If they did that with everybody on the list, I suppose you can at least get a good relative sense, but still I find that a little dishonest. If you truly "don't know a lot about history", there is one thing I'd like you to take away from this: be careful, because everybody has an angle. History is little better than politics in this regard. 

I believe in this matter, the Pope was acting much like we use the UN or international standards organizations like IETF or ISO today: as an independent international organization respected by all parties. The main factor that diminished this authority was the rise of the protestant northern countries (England, Holland, and much of Germany). Protestant countries (by definition) didn't recognize the Pope's authorithy, and had no compunction about carrying out their own overseas explorations (or siezing those of the Iberian countries). 

Wikipedia claims that, while color printing was known even in the earliest printed works, it was various Chromoxylography processes developed in the 1800's that first made color printing practical enough to be commonplace. 

My guess is that they were meant to be service flags. These were usually rectangular flags with a wide red rectangular border and a white middle area. In the middle area, a person would place a number of stars indicating the number of loved ones you had serving (blue star for serving, gold for killed). 

I know it has been common practice in the USA in the past to send convicted criminals to serve in the military in time of war in lieu of jail or some other kind of community service. Particularly during WWII, when thousands of men were paroled contingent on military service. During the unit self-intro bit at the beginning of Stripes, I believe at least one recruit had been sent by a judge. That is high fiction of course, but I know of a least one reference in non-fiction: In the opening chapters of Hill 488 Ray Hildreth relates being given a choice of jail or military service after some "youthful indiscretions" This is cheifly something that was done back when there was a draft (and thus men of fighting age would have been at a premium), not something done today with the USA's all-volunteer armed forces. So the reference in Stripes was probably an anachronisim. Today the USA armed forces generally do not even accept convicted (violent) felons. For example, the current Army regs(pdf) on this require a waiver for a lot of criminal offenses, and a lot more cannot be waived. 

Polynesians discovered and colonized pretty much the entire Pacific this way. Easter Island is one of their more impressive discoveries, but it isn't even the most impressive. That title has to go to Madagascar, which was settled from Borneo (about 5,000 miles away!). How did they do this? Well, the Polynesians were the ancient world's best navigators, and had developed all kinds of techniques. One thing not many of us land-lubbers think about is migratory birds. They can't fly forever, so islands they can stop and rest at are important to them. They don't just flap around the ocean aimlessly looking for islands when they get tired; they fly straight from island to island. Therefore an ancient navigator knows he must eventually find land if he just follows the trail of migratory birds. One other thing to note. Sweet Potatoes were domesticated in (mainland) South America. However, they somehow appeared in New Guinea (and got added to the standard diet) about 1200 years ago. That's 8,000 miles away. How did this happen? There are some wacky one-in-a-million theories running around, but the most likely explanation is that there was some small amount of interaction (perhaps even trade) going on between Polynesians and South Americans as far back as 800 CE.
