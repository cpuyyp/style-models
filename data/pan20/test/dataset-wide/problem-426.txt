What the mechanics of their Soul getting to the Otherworld? Interfere with that. Examples: 1) The entity that takes them there or guides them there stops doing its job. 2) There are some people that die too soon, or are so in love with Life, or another living person, or so consumed by their responsibilities, they can't bring themselves to go to the Otherworld, as a consequence their Soul dies and they become evil and undead -- precisely the opposite of themselves in Life! 3) Certain kinds of death or actions result in souls being barred from the Otherworld; and they die. Death by suicide, rapists, murderers, and people that double dip their chips in the salsa. 

Most likely not. Like our own transistors in real life, Human neurons have already evolved to the very edge of being as small as they can be and still function without being overwhelmed by electrical noise (noise causes errors); and evolution preserves this tiny size (and myelin coating) for the same reason we prefer tiny transistors: It makes communications between parts faster, getting more done in less time. If everything in the giants is multiplied by 3, their brains internal communications would run 3 times slower than that of a normal human; making them very slow dullards. If their neurons are small like ours, they still have this problem: Without a complete brain reorganization, they will inevitably have communications between remote parts of the brain that take 3 times what our communication takes. On top of that, their neural signals to muscles will take three times as long to reach the muscles; making reaction times slower, and inputs (ears, eyes, touch) will take three times as long to reach their neural centers, also contributing to making reaction times much slower. Also, most of their larger brain will be taken up by having to process a much larger volume of body, skin sensors (pain, cold, warmth, pressure) and other operations; there is a strong correlation between brain size and body size for that reason. Finally, you need some working definition of what super-intelligent means. Borrowing from the artificial intelligence field; one such working definition would be what most of us think of as a generalization of Sherlock Holmes type abilities, when investigating crimes. To solve crimes, Sherlock typically spots tiny obscure clues and translates them into what must have happened: In one case, the Dog that Didn't Bark, he deduces that because a dog did NOT bark at whomever committed a crime, the dog must have known the perpetrator, which with other clues narrowed the list of suspects to one. Similarly, intelligence is the ability to solve puzzles, extrapolate from clues, and arrive at theories or models of reality that have a high probability of being correct. This includes "prediction" about the past and present, not just the future: Geologists study patterns in rocks and deduce what must have happened (volcanoes, earthquakes, floods). Astronomers study patterns in the light of stars and deduce supernova must have happened hundreds of millions of years ago. Archaeologists study patterns of fossils to deduce what must have gone on hundreds of millions of years ago, here. We have patterns that let us deduce what must be happening now: a column of smoke indicates a probable fire, even if we do not sense any fire directly. We have patterns to deduce what will happen; in the weather tomorrow, in politics next month, in our health, in our economy, in our sciences. As a working definition of higher intelligence, we can measure it as better pattern interpretation with a higher probability of being correct when deducing what most likely happened, is happening or will happen. So better deductions, or being better at finding obscure patterns that are useful in such deductions, or have meaning. "Meaning" is about ramifications or constraints; when somebody says "Do you know what this means?", they are saying they have identified a pattern that will most likely have specific consequences in the future, which may be good or bad, but are in their mind are highly likely. "Meaning" is about a distinct difference; e.g. if I want my work to have "meaning" it should mean the world is different (and presumably better) because I did that work, it had impact I consider positive, etc. If somebody says something is "meaningless", they consider it to have no impact and create no difference in any outcomes they care about. (of course due to butterfly effects everything can make some difference in the future, but in human terms "meaningless" and "makes no difference" are talking about the same idea; "meaning" and "made a difference" are the flip sides.) Back to your story: It is not clear that neural mechanisms can get much better than the best of what we have now. For soldiers, that is not likely to be a good outcome: If they are more intelligent than their creator, they are unlikely to take orders from their creator for very long, and are likely to outsmart their creator's attempts to control them, control him instead, and implement their own agenda rather quickly and effectively: That is what greater intelligence means: Better anticipation of outcomes and reactions, better predictions of what strategies will work, and thus fewer mistakes and greater successes. When we build a trap and bait it; we are anticipating the behavior and reactions of an animal, and the animal's lower intelligence is failing to anticipate that taking the bait will have various consequences (mechanical for a trap, or biological in the case of spiked bait). It is our ability to see correctly predict what will happen (and because of that ability, devise a way to make something happen) that costs the animal its life and produces our dinner. If your giants truly are far more intelligent than ordinary humans and can predict outcomes with 3 times the accuracy of humans, then your "genius creator" will be no match for them; like a monkey charging a man with a shotgun. 

Yes, obviously, if stone materials are available. The pyramids were built, right? Stonehenge was built. The Roman Coliseum was built, and we know how. Infinite money and workers means stone walls of great height and width can be built. Unlike the pyramids; it is not necessary to have huge stones that are problematic; just 'large' stones of one ton or so can be shaped (using other rocks) and moved by about 20 men (i.e. they must each carry 100lb some distance). Such rocks can be loaded on a barge and transported to their destination. twenty or forty men on the barge can lower the rock into the water. Divers (natural divers can dive a hundred feet, and hold their breath for minutes at a time) can guide them to put the stones in position. Likewise, using medieval (or even Roman) technology, such a sea wall could easily be built. 

P.S. If you want; they can take all the salt and minerals from the oceans too; there are thousands of compounds they might want there that would be absent on hothouse Venus. So they leave behind freshwater oceans. Find a contour map of the oceans with depths; pick your new ocean level and you will have your new landscape. 

First, I upvoted Erin's answer; Vets should be great at just about everything. I keep dogs as pets; one of my dogs had bladder stones and my local vet did the surgery of opening him up; cutting open the bladder, feeling around and getting all the sand and stones out; and putting him all back together. She didn't screw it up, my dog recovered fine. My dog wasn't her first; she had done dozens before him. Vets can do full hip replacement surgery on animals with arthritis, they can amputate hopelessly damaged or diseased limbs and fit animals with prosthetics; in my neighborhood there is a dog with an artificial front right foot (I don't know the owner; another neighbor says the dog's original foot was run over by a car. Must have been a traumatic time for all). The extremes may be a problem, things that vets often do not deal with, because at some point we just euthanize animals; such as those struck by cars or bitten by snakes. Also the vet may not have had any experience with many cases of human health care like transplants, or chronic illnesses like tuberculosis or spreading cancer. Human doctors have hundreds of ways of keeping a person alive for years, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, long after an animal owner would have given up. Vets may be aware of such measures but have never been personally involved --- just because euthanasia is very seldom a choice (or may even be illegal) for human doctors, patients, and guardians of patients. Especially euthanasia to save money on further (or continuous) treatment or medicine. I am noting this because in game play, these extremes may present useful obstacles. On average your vet would be able to treat things like gunshot wounds, knife stabs, broken legs, etc. In such cases consider the vet exactly like an E.R. doctor, with full surgical ability and complete medicinal knowledge. But if you need plot points where players must make choices, your vet might not have any experience with more extreme health care choices. 

The only thing evil people understand and respect is brutality, and they won't even respect that unless it follows rules. Otherwise they wouldn't be evil, if they were held back by principles, or empathy, or sympathy, they couldn't do the things that they do. So in this case, as per your setup, the most powerful entity is going to rule, but it cannot be by whim: There must be clear rules about what is allowed and what will get you killed in the most painful way possible for you, and they must magically enforce that penalty, even if it costs them more than they'd like, on every monster that violates the rules. I would add, even though you didn't ask, that if the Monsters cannot exercise their evil then they probably won't stay, and your city will eventually be abandoned. They aren't going to live in peace with each other just because it is a city! The value of a city is proximity and opportunity, usually at the hub of some kind of trade or attraction (e.g. movie studios, financials, shipping and trading, farm or ranch markets, etc.) For plausibility, I'd expect monsters to be there for a reason, to ply their evil trade perhaps, or live on the magic energy. The most probable rules to pass first are "don't damage the infrastructure," "don't steal from the shops", etc. Murdering and eating a pedestrian may be okay, but shoplifting gets you shredded alive, buster. 

It only depends on whether there are catchable fish in the ocean. There is plenty of evidence that very early humans (even non-humans, like Neandertal and Heidelbergensis (the predecessor of both Neandertal and Homo Sapiens)) knew how to tie nets and make flint knives and spears; and archaeologists have found carved animal bones that may have served as fish barbs (for spear points) and fish hooks from "prehistoric" (pre-technological) humans ten thousand years ago. Take a chunk of hard femur and use a rock or sharp flint to pare it into a shape you want. What else were you doing today anyway? Fish alone, even raw, can supply enough protein and nutrients (eat the brains, eyeballs and organs) to keep humans alive for many years; no vegetables needed. All you need next is seaworthy rafts and an ability to dive and swim; also in evidence from prehistoric times. See Thor Heyerdahls's Voyage of the Kon-Tiki, for example. Also note that such rafts can be HUGE, the size of several football fields; and with pitch (waterproof tar widely used in prehistoric construction) and strong hair rope (animal or human hair), many smaller rafts can be made (say 10 yards square) and lashed together, making a resilient, flexible surface that is nearly impossible to overturn or sink. Especially if the inner material (I say inner because I presume it is covered by pitch) is reeds and wood that naturally floats; the platform may be swamped by a wave but will rise to the surface again anyway. Such rafts can have shelter from the sun and precipitation built on board. Fresh water would be a distinct problem, but large skins full of fresh water are buoyant enough to be easily towed, and it is possible to capture rainfall in the ocean. Also water can be obtained through food metabolism (see here), basically fish blood has the same salinity as terrestrial blood, so does not create a salt-elimination problem for us. Although I have never heard of any archaeological evidence of it, I think solar stills to distill seawater might be within the scope of prehistoric human technology, it isn't like they never saw water evaporate or condense. If nothing else, they could learn to follow the rain. The answer is: Sea faring cultures could abound and live on the sea for years at a time, plenty of time to find other lands and colonize them, without any need for a terrestrial path, or any technology more advanced than what we have evidence for actually existing in prehistory. Response to Comments about Raft Size See The Benson Raft, as an example; circa 1906, a gigantic sea worthy cargo raft made of logs (tied together with chains not available to primitive people, but still, giant rafts of logs **can be ** seaworthy). Here is an article on Pre-Columbian Rafts, made of bundled Reed and wood, often bamboo, these are tied together by hemp, and which mentions they were found as much as 36 feet long, with over 30 men, and 30 ton cargo capacity. Spanish explorers in the 1500's encountered them, and reported the rafts were almost unsinkable; because the were constructed so water just washed through them. Note these particular rafts in South America only lasted six months to a year, but were not coated in pitch like early Egyptian rafts, which lasted for many years. In my commentary response I discuss using timbers to make rafts, which I consider viable. Bamboo is another very popular alternative and seaworthy. But rafts are not the only option: early sailing ships where constructed of timbers with pitch or tar for waterproofing, and iron or metal is never a necessity in wood-working. We have all heard of dove-tail joining; and woodworkers can create dozens of similar locking mechanisms to join wood by simple carving; I have seen an hourglass kind of join for joining boards edge to edge, for example. The question isn't necessarily about the materials or the shape of the ship, just whether primitive humans could build something to live on the ocean for years. All oceans, if heated by a sun, will have convection patterns that circulate between continents. An ocean-going tribe caught in a storm might well find themselves on something like our Gulf Stream and transported to another continent, which they might choose to colonize, especially if they are the first intelligent species to set foot there, and don't want to risk trying to find their way home (Ocean streams are one-way streets, the one that brought you to point B won't take you back to Point A.)
