These citations all seem to indicate that, in particular, autophagy of unhealthy cells is a function of good immune response. *NOTE * My research has yet to show whether autophagy of healthy cells contributes specifically to improved immune function. 

Presumably, you've been told to take the Band-Aid off periodically in order to give it air. In fact, this slows healing, so if you wish to have your cut heal as quickly as possible, keep it bandaged. The primary benefit of a bandage is to help seal the wound and stop or slow bleeding and prevent re-injury and infection. Where people start to differ in opinion is once the wound has been cleaned and placed in a sterile environment. At this point, the primary benefit of bandages are to keep the wound moist, which your well-meaning friend might not realize provides optimal conditions for healing. 

Autophagy leads to improved immune function. This question targets improvements to immune function in particular. This is confirmed by the following articles following articles. 

No, and I consider this 11 page publication to be the most authoritative assessment of the matter. It covers all the topics you've raised, as well as assessing whether it was possible that elephants were once capable of jumping (they weren't). With respect to your mention of the "Elephant Jumping Festival" - that is false, and discussed at the end of page 6. Page 7 covers the origin of the mythical anecdotes that baby elephants have been observed jumping. Furthermore experiments conducted to test this explicitly (by dangling food out of reach) have never produced this behaviour. [1] Natan Slifkin.

In summary and in (partial) answer to your question, with many caveats outlined in the above to papers, girl brains develop faster than boy brains. This may correspond to earlier "maturation" in the colloquial sense, if that sense is understood, for example, as the development of the frontal lobe, which is responsible for impulse control. The issue of whether such differences are affected by nurture is not addressed in these studies. There is however strong evidence for significant physiological differences in the rate of brain development. 

Even more seriously, a study in the 1992 issue of Psychological Medicine concludes that "Later-onset AD [Alzheimers Disease] was found to be positively associated with starvation/malnutrition and with nose-picking." In short, Dr. Bischinger (mentioned in the linked article) has provided us with zero evidence for his assertions. He has not published his findings in a peer review journal, nor do other studies support his conclusions. The eating part is therefore dubious. By contrast the dangers of nose-picking are well-documented, and must outweigh any supposed gastrointestinal benefits of ingesting mucus.† †Please note that this answer does not constitute medical advice.

Conclusion Resources seem to suggest that intermittent fasting is a feasible way to increase autophagy, but by no means suggest that this is the best (most effective or healthiest) method. Many sources suggest that mere caloric restrictions, not outright fasting, are the key. There are some very popular diets that specifically target autophagy. The Atkins Diet relies heavily on ketosis as a method of reducing body fat, which, in itself, could be considered a form of cellular autophagia. [Ref] It remains to be shown (by my research) whether intermittent fasting promotes autophagy in infected cells where it wouldn't otherwise be triggered, or whether the promotion of autophagy in healthy cells improves to immune function. 

I've heard anecdotes time and time again from people with allergies that their parent ate a lot of the food they're allergic too while pregnant. Is there any known correlation? Alright, let's jazz up this question with some sources: 

Their references only reach as far back as 1995. I am doubtful that any scientist would have more recently dignified this claim with an investigation. Any individual doctor or nutritionist, when consulted, is able to debunk these fears with basic facts of medicine and chemistry. Over time, the nature of the claim has changed (from causing death, to Leprosy, to Vitiligo, to generic skin disease, to generic bad health - but mostly Leprosy). There's zero evidence for these claims in modern times. The cause for Leprosy is now well known and has nothing to do with fish or milk or any combination of the two. [4] 

Moreover, the same paper concludes that "in the case of mice infected with influenza virus, ion-deprivation increases the cumulative mortality rate" and "since ion depletion is a constant concomitant of modern urban life, one reasonably may speculate about comparable inimical effects on humans." A study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology in 2009 finds ionization "to be an effective method for reduction in surface and airborne bacteria." In this study ionizers were installed inside refrigerators, and although effective the amount of reduction depended "the constructional layout and material properties of the ionizer housing, air circulation within the refrigerator and the interior volume" or the refrigerator. An earlier study in the Journal of Food Protection concludes that "high levels of negative air ions can have a significant impact on the airborne microbial load, and that most of this effect is through direct killing of the organisms." By contrast, a study done in 2007 by the School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds suggests that "the bactericidal action attributed to negative air ions by previous researchers may have been overestimated." To summarize then, it seems that ionizers can indeed reduce the airborne bacterial load but could also be bad for humans. A reasonable piece of advice comes from the same 1976 article in Science quoted above, which recommends to "maintain air ion concentrations and ratios approximating those existing in nature" and expresses hope that "air ion levels of urban air will approach those of clean rural air." Please note that this answer does not constitute medical advice. It is only meant to summarize published research related to the original claim and limited to the cited sources. Consult your physician about what these results may mean for your health. 

These are the simplest arguments that can be conjured up without requiring you to dig too deeply into things like interferometry and quantum electrodynamics - but these too are easily observable in the classical world and are completely incompatible with any theory that postulates a speed of light that is affected by the speed of the source. 

A 1996 published African article titled [3], did a thorough investigation of the origin and evolution of this, and related myths, as well as referencing a handful of scientists that performed more scientifically thorough investigations:

The seminal review on graphology is "Illusory Correlations in Graphological Inference" by Roy N. King and Derek J. Koehler, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology. The study supports two major conclusions. (1) A meta-review of the literature finds "overwhelming evidence" against the predictive validity of graphology. (2) "Semantic association between words used to describe handwriting features and personality traits was the source of biases in perceived correlation" between hand-writing and personality. In other words: the science of graphology is junk, but people continue to believe it because words used to describe handwriting (e.g. messy, unclear, neat, confused, meticulous) can so easily be used to pass judgement on the person. Why the French in particular disregard the science for superstition is a topic for another question. 

This article Bumblebees finally cleared for takeoff is a good summary of a Cornell physicist's research in the year 2000 mathematically demonstrating and simulating why bees and similar insects can fly. 

This study focused on Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, and how intermittent fasting increased autophagy of Schwann cells (which is apparently a good thing). One final article, a little older than the others, but that will probably interest you more, is a generic treatment of how autophagy is triggered by caloric restriction and leads to a decrease in age-related manifestations that are a result of reduced autophagic activities. [6] *NOTE * My research has yet to show whether intermittent fasting leads to increased autophagy of infected cells that would not normally undergo autophagy as part of the natural immune response. 

To me, this is a huge misinterpretation of the observational study (N Engl J Med), which appears to have merely correlated self-proclaimed coffee drinkers with living longer. We know of course that correlation does not imply causation, and the relationship could be due to a number of things, such as the possible fact that coffee drinkers tend to wake up earlier and have more active days, which might improve their overall health. Is there anything in this or any other study to actually suggest a causal relationship between drinking coffee and living longer, or is this being blown out of proportion by popular media?

I am somewhat surprised by the findings, but there is a lot of published research on this topic. A paper published in Science in 1976 maintains that:

Barring further major developments contradicting the above, I consider this question resolved in the affirmative: according to reputable (American) sources Assad used chemical weapons against his opposition in 2013. 

The claim is plausible. Let's break it down into several components: Q: Are monkeys capable of stealing wallets or learning to use vending machines? A: Certainly. There is ample video evidence of monkeys stealing wallets and using vending machines. Token-based food vending is common practice in studies of animal behavior. Q: Are simians capable of learning how to use vending machines on their own? A: Yes. See "Socially biased learning in monkeys" by Fragaszy and Visalberghi in Animal Learning & Behavior (2004) 32: 24 among similar studies.
