The Attack on Mers-el-Kébir/Battle of Mers-el-Kébir was an action that took part between the Royal Navy and the French Navy on July 3rd 1940 that was a result of Winston Churchill ordering that the French Fleet should either join the RN, with or without French crews, or be neutralised. 

In the 74 days that Argentina occupied the Falkland Islands several people were at first deported and then placed under house arrest at Fox Bay East. Governor Rex Hunt was removed from the islands the day of his surrender: 

Granted, not all of these formations contained destroyers but the extent of the deployments maintained by the Royal Navy is important in this case. 

Having searched around the suggestions above, I eventually found this badge that is listed as a Imperial Russian Fire Society badge. As you can see, there are several similarities between it and the badge in your picture; the helmet and crossed axes mainly. 

Here in the UK, a network of bunkers were built and maintained into the 1990's - mostly by the MOD. Unfortunately for us plebs, the vast majority of these bunkers were not intended for use by the general public. Instead the bunkers were intended to be used by local council members, police chiefs, government ministers, military personnel and, of course, the Royal Family. 

Background: Recently I've been reading about the Roman Republic, specifically about its last century of civil war and disorder, and I've noticed that some historians say that the Republic fell because its institutions were prepared to handle only a small territory, not the big empire that the Romans conquered throughout the centuries. The most recent book where I found this line of thought was Mary Beard's SPQR, but I've seen it in other places before. The problem is that when these books talk about the end of the Republic, they in general just list events concerning the Gracchus brothers' fight for redistribution of land, Marius' and Sulla's civil wars, and events concerning the First Triumvirate — they never tackle the issues of obsolete institutions directly. Even the article in The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic pertaining to the topic only mentions this obsolescence and says the idea is correct, but doesn't elaborate on it. From these works I've gathered that Roman institutions were obsolete precisely because they permitted the existence of this kind of conflict, but I still don't understand why that's the case, which institutions were obsolete and why. Question: What institutions were so obsolete as to cause the fall of the Republic, and why did they function properly only with a small territory? 

Well, according to this article on DefenceNow, the Indian Army hasn't purchased any new field artillery since the 1970's. 

The paper then continues in it's assessment with quotes from Soviet commanders, for example in one section it states that Moscow's assessment of the reliability of it's allies was more pessimistic than the Wests mentioning that the memoirs of Col. Oleg Penkovskiy repeatedly mentions Soviet concerns about East German forces. 

According to "Birth of a Legend. The Bomber Mafia and the Y1B-17" by Capt Arthur H. Wagner, USCG(ret.) and Lt Col Leon E. Braxt, a Bulgarian Air Force pilot suggested the use of aircraft for bombing during the First Balkan War in 1912. Subsequently, Captain Simeon Petrov developed the idea and created a number of prototypes. After a number of iterations the final design had an increased payload, an X-Shaped tail, improved aerodynamics and an impact fuse. Furthermore, the book states that copies of the plans were later sold to Germany, was codenamed Chataldzha, and remained in mass production until the end of WW1. The paragraph containing this information can be found here (Google Books). While this doesn't speak for the other combatant nations in WW1, I can't imagine that the technology was that different. 

It seems that the word 'hospital' would be misleading. The majority of ancient institutions treated only specific parts of the population, while modern hospitals don't make that distinction. Also, in general physicians went themselves to the houses of the sick, and not the other way around (this, of course, if the sick could pay). But there were some institutions that treated specific sectors of the population, such as slaves and the military. About Valetudinaria: Romans had valetudinaria for slaves and military infirmaries, examples of such institutions. But this was not always the case, at least for slaves: until 50 CE sick slaves were in general dumped in the Aesculapium and not treated by their masters, which only changed when emperor Claudius issued a decree forbidding such a practice. Nevertheless, the 'physicians' in slave valetudinaria were even compared by Cornelius Celsus with veterinarians and barbarian doctors, and did not offer high-quality care. I didn't find any sources that stated that these were state-sponsored institutions, though, and it seems to me that they would be generally privately owned, so as to reduce money losses by the owners in the form of dying slaves. I also could not find sources that told what happened to these slave institutions in the 3rd century in specific, although if something changed with them probably these changes would have been mentioned in the works used. About military valetudinaria, however, there is more information. As you said, the motivation for these institutions was pretty obvious, to maintain a healthy and functional military, and a standard plan for the fortresses built by the military included a valetudinarium in a quiet sector of the fortress. Nevertheless, in the 3rd century it seems that the military institutions had declined, and Alexander Severus (222-35) "allowed soldiers who were seriously ill to retire to a city and convalesce with some family of the town." (quote from Miller) About the Aesculapium: For the Asklepieia, temples of the god of medicine of which the Aesculapium is an example, it seems that they didn't provide hospital care. They didn't provide suppliants with a place to sleep, with food, or even with nursing care. Pausanias seems to provide some backing to the claim that these institutions really took care of the sick, specifically about the Aesculapium at Phocis, and says that the sacred precinct included the temple together with dwellings for both the sick and the servants of the god. This, however, doesn't mean that all Aesculapium had these facilities, and evidence for the contrary seems scarce. The ritual for curing, for example, didn't include medicinal care or anything like this, and was more of a ritual practice. The sick made a sacrifice to the god Asklepios, and then went to sleep on mats on the floor; after some days, the god might cure the sick person, or appear in his dreams asking him to perform a specific action, or even recommend an accepted medical remedy, that doesn't seem to have been provided by the Aesculapium. These specific actions sometimes included things like jumping into an almost frozen river, for example. Physicians did work as priests in these temples, but they don't seem to apply medical knowledge in treating the sick, preferring to ask for spiritual help. About hospitals in general: The works I read made specific claims about institutions resembling true hospitals only appearing at the 4th century, namely the xenodocheia or ptochotropheia. This kind of institution was in general backed up by a church, by ecclesiastical means, and could be used by everyone that wished to do so. Nevertheless it seems that the richer part of the population still preferred to be treated by private physicians instead of going to these institutions. Works used: MILLER, Thimothy.

It's worth remembering that it was common for ships of the Royal Navy to carry some livestock for slaughter, milk etc. and the the Captain and Officers of a ship would often buy their own provisions to supplement those supplied by the Victualing Board. 

So, to answer your question "Is there documentation of any concerns from high ranking Soviet military officers, or of their Warsaw Pact counterparts, as to the reliability of Warsaw Pact allies in the event of a military engagement with NATO during the 1980's?" The paper I have found (and linked to) lists several sources and indicates that both the Western Intelligence community and Moscow, as well as other WP nations, believed that NSWP forces would not be totally reliable in the event of conflict. To be honest, I've just read through most of the article and quoted parts that I feel are relevant to your question, but you will get a much better, and much more in depth, answer to your question by reading the article I have linked to. 

The following quotes, from English Medieval Knight 1400-1500 By Christopher Gravett on Google Books, states that retained Men-At-Arms would have worn their lords colours. 

In The Corrupting Sea (2000), the authors state that Cyrenaica's harvest time was "a month earlier than that of most of Greece and well before that of the Black Sea" (p. 72), and because of this the area was very important for Greek economy in the 4th century BCE. For this claim, their source is Brun, P. (1993) 'La stèle des céréales de Cyrène et le commerce des grains en Égée au IVe siècle', which I couldn't find online and even if I did I wouldn't be able to read it, seeing that I can't read in French. Since no other sources or details are given, I speculated that Cyrenaica's geographical position, closer to the Equator than Greece and the Black Sea, provided it with stronger sunlight, which made harvest times there earlier. But as I said this is mere speculation, seeing that I have not considered soil and other weather conditions. Also, I assumed that the same crops were planted in Greece and Cyrenaica, namely wheat. The Wikipedia page on Cyrenaica confirmed that this region exported wheat. Also, the most promising page I found was linked to harvest festivals, that could happen in different times of the year in different places because of differing climates and crops, but there was not much information beyond this. Therefore my question, which I apologize for its very specific nature, is this: what ambiental factors could have lead to this difference in harvest times specifically in ancient Cyrenaica? 

Unfortunately, there I can't find loads of easily accessible information on Clipperton's occupation in WW2 by the US. However, what I can find indicates that Clipperton was briefly inhabited up to somewhere between 1937 and 1939 by the French in the form of a restored Lighthouse and a small military outpost. I can find no other records that state the Clipperton was inhabited beyond this time, until the arrival of the US Navy in 1944. I have found what could be a potentially interesting resource for the United States Naval Institute Proceedings Magazine - Feb 1962 Vol 88/2/708, which contains the article "The Clipperton Operation" by George M. Lowry, Rear Admiral United States Naval Reserve (Retired) Unfortunately, I cannot access the whole article as it is behind a paywall. Here is what can be seen: 

That isn't to say that a number of ordinary people wouldn't have been able to gain access to these regional bunkers in case of attack, the largest had room for 6,000 people, but the vast majority of us would have been left to fend for ourselves. A series of leaflets, radio broadcasts and public information films were circulated throughout the 1970's and 1980's called "Protect and Survive". These instructed the general public on what steps to take should the UK have been attacked. 

What he meant by this is that people were not forced to convert to Islam, and instead the situation was rigged so that it was an advantageous thing to do. Muslim people paid less taxes than non-Muslims, even if they weren't Arabs, and people could only be a part of the ruling elite by being Muslims. (Curiously, this was so even though the administrative language was still Greek for some time after the conquests.) Another key element is that it was essential to be a Muslim if one wished to pursue a military career. Of course after some time problems arose between newly-converted people and old-timers, but that goes beyond the question. About Mu'awiya and his claim to the Caliphate in 656: his family already had properties in Syria, which let him form a power base that lifted him to the Caliphate in 661, after the First Muslim Civil War. So even though the general population didn't convert, his participation in the ruling class made him able to advance his name as a possible Caliph after the death of Uthman, the last of the Rashidun Caliphs. All these claims are due to the aforementioned book by Hugh Kennedy. 

This explains the reasons relatively clearly, but it seems a bit like "We have the most and biggest guns so we're in charge" kinda thing. What I'd like to know is: When NATO was originally formed was there any resistance to the setting of the precedent that the President of the United States nominated SACEUR, and that SACEUR would always be American? Where there any political reasons for SACEUR being American beyond the Americans wanting to retain control of a force that heavily comprised of their troops and wanting to retain tactical control of their nuclear weaponry? Why is it that only British and German officers have served as his Deputy? and who chooses the Deputy SACEUR? 

The Bill of Rights then went on to declare William and Mary the King and Queen of the United Kingdom. 

Having done some research on Urban Renewal, it seems that is a phenomenon that occurs for the same reasons in African and Asian nations as it does in Western nations - in that it occurs when it needs to in order for an area of a city to be rebuilt or repurposed. One of the best papers I found concerning Urban Renewal is "Neighborhood Regeneration in Beijing" on the McGill University School of Architecture website. 

In many moments of Roman imperial history coin was debased, with its silver contents being reduced over time, and in general this was linked with increasing imperial expenditures. In Harper's The Fate of Rome (2017) it is stated that Caracalla needed to create a new kind of coin, the antoninianus, to be able to pay soldiers after he raised their pay. This new coin was said by the state to be worth two denarii, even though its silver contents only reached the mark of 80% of the silver contained in two denarii. It seems that this worked for a while. But in the 250s and 260s the denarii and sesterces were progressively melted down, eventually disappearing, and the antoninianus, the sole remaining silver coin, was debased until it was a billon coin, almost pure vile metal. Harper says that people must have started holding on to good metal, taking coins out of circulation and accelerating the currency crisis. In the author's words, "no other era of Roman history is so productive of coin hoards." (p. 148) My question is: How could Romans, in this period and in other periods as well, tell if their coins were being debased? How could those people that took coins out of circulation know that their silver content was getting lower? Did they keep measuring the density of new coins, or did the state advertise that new coins had less silver? (This would seem counterproductive if the objective of these measures was to pay for the state's debts.) (My research so far didn't give any results, as the articles I found were only about debasement as a problem for the Roman Empire, and didn't tell me what I wanted to know)
