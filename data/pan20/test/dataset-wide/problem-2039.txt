Sure, and I would hand you this resume right away: Nolo Problemo Senior Software Engineer, 1983 to Present Highly qualified in judging people, especially prospective co-workers. I'm the guy who will offer his opinion after you have left the interview room as to whether we want to hire this arrogant knucklehead. 

Most interviewers are going to tell you their role, and an open-ended question such as, "So where do you fit into the organization?" is fine, but requesting a resume? And then let your interviewer sit there and fidget while you read it? You're not showing them that you're easy to do business with. 

You're equating perhaps unclear formatting and punctuation with informality. Those are different concepts. Word choice, capitalization, and punctuation matter to understanding your message. If you're using your phone keyboard, then all lower case is common and expected, but if you're sitting at a full-size keyboard, it's a lot easier to read and your meaning is clearer if you use proper case and punctuation. 

Porn websites generate a lot of traffic, which means you need some pretty solid technical skills and good decision making abilities in order to get something like that up and running and keeping it that way. On top of this, such sites tend to scale relatively fast, you have to be ready for it. Also, most of the good techniques used to monetize a website also apply to such a site, and this is not as easy as it sounds. 

Even if people on this site tell you the way they do it or the way it's usually done, such things can easily be completely different based on company culture. Therefore, in my opinion, the best solution is to just ask one of your coworkers about the way it's done in your company. They will probably be glad to help you. By-the-way: the more formal your company is (especially larger ones), the more likely it is that the answer to your main question is No. 

I have to agree with @Pete, you have to look out for #1. If the founder's previous company sold for $300 million, that doesn't mean he has that much in the bank, and that certainly doesn't mean he is willing to spend it on this startup. One thing people forget is that the wealthy don't gamble with their own money, they gamble with other people's money. That's how they stay wealthy, and that's why they're looking for venture capital money. I've been where you were, with a founder who made a bucket of money off his first startup, private jet, etc., and the VC money was just around the corner. The new company was so disorganized and had the absolute wrong people trying to run it that it didn't last and collapsed one night owing everybody money. The founder went on to the next startup and the worker bees went away with nothing after a year of below average pay, benefits, & wasted nights & weekends. YMMV, however. If you're learning stuff (including how not to run a company) it might be worthwhile hanging around. If not, bail. 

Maybe 26K was before taxes and 20.34K is after taxes. So there's a reasonable chance that they didn't lie to you. I recommend proceeding with caution: don't go in there with accusations and finger pointing. Instead, state your concern about this in a polite and calm manner. 

While sexual harrasment is definitely not OK, there's something you need to keep in mind: if you decide to take the legal route suggested by @apaul34208, you will have a very very hard time maintaining a good working relationship after all this, even if you win. What your boss did is probably insufficient for her to be dismissed, which means, after all the legal "battle" is over, she will still be your boss. And your working relationship with her will be very difficult or awkward. Quitting or transfering to another team or department is probably going to be the next step. So, my advice is: if you try to involve lawyers and everything that comes with it, expect the complications mentioned above to occur. 

As a 1099, they're already off-loading most of their expenses of being a regular (W2) on you anyway. I've been in the same situation. One way to look at this is that you are trying to generate business for yourself, through the original client to which you're a 1099. If they are guaranteeing you that when the new client signs on you will also get more work, then it might be reasonable to pay your own way to woo the new client. But if they're just using you to pad their marketing budget with your free resources, I would politely beg off and tell them to send someone else. But whatever you decide, the good news is that now you know. The original client is trying to squeeze whatever he can out of you. And you can act accordingly. 

If you were to privately talk to him about this, that not only does it bother you, it's painful (because sinus problems are painful), how do you think he would react? As my wife always tells me, "It's all in the approach." If you think he's a considerate guy, and is self-aware enough to realize he's got an addiction to a habit that affects others, just try talking to him honestly. I've worked with people at both ends of the spectrum; some who were considerate to others' sensitivity to smoke and some who would stub out their cigarette on your face if you complained. As always, whatever you decide, make sure your resume is up to date before you broach the subject. Good luck. 

I am currently doing a short internship for a month at a games developers that may result in a part-time job at the end. I am generally a fast worker, and often complete tasks way before people expect me to. The main problem I have is that I feel as though I am pestering the employees when I am asking for stuff to do, because I'm there every half-hour to an hour. At one point they ran out of stuff for me to do until the manager got back to give me something to work on. Now I am finding it hard to go and ask for more work, because I feel anxious that I am annoying them, even though I know they appreciate having the stuff done. I've spent time on learning things I want to as well, but whenever I do I feel guilty that I'm not working hard because I'm reading up on coding etc. How do I better approach people asking for work to do without feeling as awkward and how do I make it so that they have an expectation for me to finish things quickly, and not constantly be surprised when I'm already finished? 

Yes, if an interviewer will ask you about it, it's best to admit that you got fired and also provide some details if they ask for them. However, I would like to point out that most interviewers will probably not believe that the tiny typo got you fired, simply because it's a little ridiculous. I know I wouldn't believe it. They will most likely imagine that you were a poor performer and the email typo was the excuse the company needed to let you go. Now, I doubt the interviewers will explicitly say this to you but, in order to crush those suspicions as best as possible, be extra prepared to prove that you will be a valueable employee. References from people currently working at your last company have the highest chance of accomplishing this. 

I'm referring to multiple and diverse types of information, all of which are clearly visible on my resume. There was almost no interview in which I didn't experience this. So, my question is: why does this happen ? Reviewing a resume for 5 - 10 minutes for each candidate you're going to interview shouldn't be that big of a time consumer and it actually gets you more prepared for the actual discussion. EDIT. A little clarification: It's not like I expect them to memorize it or anything. Just skim through it for 5 minutes so that you won't look so surprised if I tell you that I write in a technical blog or that I actively participate on StackExchange or that I actually did work with your technologies in the past. It leaves me a really bad impression of you as a company and/or as an interviewer. Companies keep saying that they need applicants who impress them. Well maybe they should take their own advice once in a while...
