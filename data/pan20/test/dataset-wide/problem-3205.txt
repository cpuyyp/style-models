A 4-part "Ideas" radio program by the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), called "On the Line: A Journal of Exploration along the Canada - U.S. Border" (presenter Marian Fraser), aired in Nov 1986 and used a series of interviews to tell the story of the border. Ep 2, "Survey and Surveillance" has a section about the Quebec/Vermont border. Dr. Alec McEwan, [then] Canada's commissioner on the International Boundary Commission, explained how the border was established: The border between Lower Canada and New York was marked in the 1760s. That the line was off due to surveyor error was known at an early time. But Vermonters were sure it was already too far south and every arbitration attempt (1790s, 1814, 1830s) to correct the survey error was stymied. 

If the restriction was applicable only to Lethbridge and not the surrounding communities, then any official action would have been a community by-law or ordinance. But according to Wikipedia, Lethbridge was not incorporated as a town until November 29, 1890, and only became a city on May 9, 1906. That leaves the possibility of corporate discrimination or informal pressures by other residents. From 1874 to 1886, the North-West Mounted Police were the authority in the region, based in Fort Whoop-Up. They would not have had authority over land purchases. Several companies, however, including the major employer North Western Coal and Navigation Company, its successor Alberta Railway and Coal Company and especially, the Canadian Pacific Railway, were involved with drawing settlers to the area. Since the Americans (whatever their religion) arriving in the area probably did not go through the CPR application process, they simply were not eligible for 25 million acres (100,000 km2) of land reserved in western Canada by that company in the 1880 contract to build the trans-continental railway. Most of those parcels were along the railway, which went through Lethbridge. 

There's really a few questions being asked and it would be better to separate them. Why didn't Europeans in the Middle Ages appreciate "antiquities?" First, because archeology hadn't been invented yet and two because it was the Dark Ages. Now, the Coliseum was scavenged because so much knowledge was lost after the collapse of the Roman Empire, the people really needed the material, but there other things at play as well. During the early Medieval Period, or "Dark Ages," through the Renaissance, art was regulated by the Catholic Church. A good amount of very beautiful art was created, but its intentions were to help its audience spiritually. All writing, music, painting, drama, sculpture and architecture created during the period reflect these notions. What was art and was not art was something decided by religious clergy. They could be particularly hard on dramatic performances, multitonal music or any developments in art. At the time, they absolutely did not consider pagan philosophy or art to be appropriate topics. In the Renaissance (14-17th century), the attitude lightened a great deal. Pagan philosophy and ideas were taught in universities. Nonreligious topics were allowed in art again for the first time. The movement originated in Italy and there was also interest in studying the old remains of classical Roman buildings. 

The city state of Siena comes to mind. Today it is famous for the horse race the Palio di Siena, which pits the cities nine districts against one another. Modern life in Siena still revolves around the horse races and citizens have little contact outside their own district. During the Middle Ages, the citizens took part in numerous sports competitions between their nine districts and each district had a separate government within the Siena city state, referred to as the "Government of Nine." In the 14th century, following plagues and famine, there were rebellions and infighting and Siena was annexed by The Grand Duchy of Tuscany. 

In late 1994 or 1995 Israel gave a small strip of farm land to Jordan after the signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty. This land was not part of the treaty but as it was east of the river (and I believe conquered in 1967 along with the West Bank) it was given as a token to the Kingdom. 

The Islamic State regularly destroys historical artefacts. Here is one from just last week. Here is another. It is widely suspected that they loot and smuggle a considerable portion of the content of the museums and historical sites that they destroy as well. 

Wikipedia has an informative article on the Saros cycle, which is used to predict eclipses. According to that page, and by extension apparently the pages to which it references, the Babylonians were recording the eclipses which describe the cycle in the sixth century BC. Apparently Hipparchus (second century BC), Pliny (first century AD) and Ptolemy (second century AD) were aware of the cyclic nature of eclipses, though the degree to which they could be predicted for a specific location is debatable. 

While searching for a canonical translation to my language of the phrase Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears I was surprised to find reference to it only in the Shakespeare play. As the play is based on historical events, was this a true historical quote or were the words concocted in the 16th century? My intuition tells me that since the Wikipedia entry for the play does not have the words in Latin, that it is in fact not an historical quote. Is it? Addendum: Since I'm not sure if this is a historical quote, it is off topic to ask about it here? If so, is there a better SE site to have asked on? 

The pact replaced Germany's long running relationship with China before WWII. Germany originally felt closer to China when it opposed the terms of the Versaille Treaty giving Germany protectorates in China to Japan. China's civil war ended in 1949, but communism was a growing force in the country in the 1930's and the weakening of China's nationalist government translated into a gulf between China and Nazi Germany. So instead Hitler sought an alliance with Japan, which had also been undergoing ideological changes, who he saw it had more ideological similarity now. I don't believe racism was an important reason or other ideological reasons. Japanese ideology, often referred to as "Japanese fascism" in the past was quite different in many ways. The most important way is that it was not a workers movement, as it was in Germany. It was instituted by the elite in Japan to "improve" and speed up capitalism and industrialization through the monopoly control of industry. Here is a good article. 

(Apologies for so much cut and paste) There are many other theorists that have looked at the reasons for the cycles of peace and war in societies, as well, but I suggest starting here. 

This figure is very much in line with the historical poverty measurements. Therefore, 50% of the American population during the Great Depression were suffering deprivation on par with the poorest of the poor of the world today. 

The Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottomon Turks in 1453. They recruited to fight them (rather than pray about the end times) and I see no reason to think that the differing religions of the two sides wasn't used to inspire the soldiers. Possibly what you are referring to is following the Plague of Justinian, the Eastern Empire gave up trying to reunite with the Western Empire and prevent its final, total collapse. Justinian I (482-565) was the Emperor, but also head of the Church in the East not long after the Sack of Rome in 410. He set about a successful military campaign against the barbarian tribes. The Plague of Justinian was a terrible disease similar to the Black Death that hit Constantinople and was believed to be a punishment from God for his marriage to a "dancer." At this time some people did believe it was the End Times. There weren't any more military campaigns, holy war or any form, because the Eastern Empire couldn't financially afford it due to the plague.
