I've a Bear Archery Super Kodiak from 2013 with 40 #. I shoot 8,2 gpp arrows on it. Recently I heard that I should not shoot a BCY 425x string on it since the high amount of vectran somehow harms my bow. Is this true? An if yes, how exactly is it harmful? 

What should one consider while storing a snowboard? Mine is in the same position for about 7 months of the year. In case it makes any differences, here are the specs: 

Skaters commonly wearing special kind of shoes. However, from my point of view they just look like a pair of sneakers. 

Since May 2015, the German Elbsandsteingebirge (Elbe Sandstone Mountains) has so called "Trekkinghütten" (trekking cabins). However, due to the fact that they're pretty new, there aren't really any longer tracks to find. What's a possible tour for two days (4-8 hour hike, sleep and 4-8 hour hike back)? 

Let's assume I hike in a region with a lot of streams, rivers and lakes (South-Germany etc.) not longer than for two days. Am I supposed to use a life-straw as my primary water-source or should it be considered just as an emergency tool? 

Often the cock feather points to the left on traditional bows. On compound bows it's either up or down (can't remember and I'm not a compound shooter). This is just something you get told when doing a course. "The cock feather needs to point to the left." But why is this the case? 

However, why do we need this plastic cup? Why can't we just say: "Okay, I have this point at my target and try to group three arrows around it." 

When I'm out in the woods I often find huge pieces, like for example a car tire or even something bigger, or huge piles of trash. Of course I can't take that with me on my hike to bring it out. What should I do then? I feel like this question can't be answered generally so let's narrow it down to Germany or other EU countries. Am I supposed to call the police? 

I'm in doubt if I should attach tracers to my arrows. Of course, they make them better visible but I've heard rumors that they do influence the arrow (other than stated by the manufacturer). Do they influence the arrow? And if yes, in which way? Tracer: 

I've fun creating archery targets. I experiment with different materials and building styles. However, I wonder what would be the characteristics to measure the quality of the tries. So, what to look for in a quality archery target? Obvious example: It should stop the arrow 

Before you hand in a sample you have to know what your water filter actually does. Use these characteristics to generate "bad" water and put it in the filter to collect the potential "good" water as your sample. 

Is there something similar - kind of an outdoor universal hook - to buy? Edit: This hook has to comfortably fit in your trouser pockets, so that it can be taken out easily. 

Due to heavy rain, the water level raised drastically in the last days and arose a few small "ponds" besides our local river. Also the main stream is accordingly extremely wild these days. Recently I've discovered a really strange behavior of our local swans. They live as a couple in our river normally. They started to collectively move to one particular shore pond a few days ago. They got started with two couples at first. Meanwhile there are swimming 20-30 swans in this small little lake. Note: 

The harder work an uphill hiker has to do The smaller field of vision of an uphill hiker They are in that "hiking rhythm" zone which shouldn't be interrupted (Inertia) 

Freely interpreted: Sometimes standing inconspicuous on the wayside: concreted marking stones with a moulded "BP" inside. These stones mark cable trays of the "Deutschen Bundespost", the predecessor of todays "Deutsche Post AG", "Deutsche Telekom" and "Deutsche Postbank". From "Heimatarchiv": 

There was this story around Mick Fanning this year. He was attacked by a shark in a surfing tournament. 

So, from a non-hunting archer's point of view, the arrow length is Is there any difference for a hunter or is calculated just the same way? 

My brother asked me lately if I wanted to join a fishing license class with him later this year. I would absolutely like that but I'm afraid that I can't handle the additional time consumption. How much time do I have to calculate with? 

Further explanation In case you didn't get what I wanted to explain, here is a paragraph which describes the problem pretty well: 

When you're up in the tree stand and need to urinate, is it okay to do it just from above or should one seek another solution? So, does your game somehow smell the urine and will stay away? Any other considerations? 

I've often thought about if there is a thumb rule how to wear a backpack comfy and safe. Where should it sit on the back to be ergonomic etc.? How do I adjust the shoulder, hip and chest straps to achieve this? 

For snowboarding reasons I need to know which country has the most "snow days" (is it even called like that?). I don't mean the highest snow height or something. Just the time when it's white outside. :) A snow-fall analogy to the "sunshine hours". I guess it's a battle between Scandinavian countries, Austria and Switzerland, isn't it? 

Freely interpreted: The "BP" stand for "Bundespost", the "Deutsche Bundespost" to be specific. The stone marks the way of the telephone cable from Cologne to "Dormagen". It was laid from the telecommunication center of the "Deutschen Bundespost" and its course marked with these stones. 

So, first of all there is no alpha male! An alpha male only exists in captive wolf packs but never ever in the wild. Further reading about this topic here for example. The pack you've encountered was a family of three (more likely in January) or two generations. 

I currently work on a diy-target. I wan to fill a big cardboard box with stuff, that stops an arrow. However, I'm not able to get my hands on foil rests or textile waste. I just have a full paper bin :) Is this paper-waste, when compressed (pressed in the box and held together with duct-tape), (cardboard, common paper) suitable to stop an arrow? 

My friend and I want to go out for roving. However, this is our first time and we wonder if there's a list what we should consider before moving out? 

Coyote Shaker A good method to get rid of coyotes is to use a coyote shaker — a soda can filled with pennies or pebbles and sealed with duct tape. This device scares the approaching coyote in three ways. Through: 

Of course it's theoretically a difference if I've a 4" or 5" fetching. I wonder if it's really practically noticeable? I'm asking from a bow-hunter's point of view (strong bow/powerful arrow). 

Is by far nothing which is considered as "weak and easy to hunt" by a wolf. Remember the "Appearing weak and small"-part from above? 

Okay, besides the "waves" in the limbs pretty much the same, eh? But have you mentioned the tips? Horseman bow string doesn't touch the limb: 

A friend of mine told me that elephants used for tourism in Thailand are mistreated. They are taken away from their mothers in the wilderness and brought to a station where they are tortured to make them calm, ready to be ridden by everyone. This process is called "cracking". Is this true? How exactly does this process work? Why do the gameskeepers not react? 

However, I'm not sure where the the kill exactly would be. I assume that it's the little brown spot beneath the arm, on the edge to the white stomach-fur? 

First of all, yes, you should absolutely wax your bow string. Especially if you've this kind of setup. The good news is, that it's extremely easy. Get a bow wax Purchase an appropriated wax from your local bow-dealer. Just buy a "real" bow-wax. There are a lot of resources on the www which suggest different kinds of other waxes. However, this is often a compromise somehow. However, what I want to say is that a bow wax isn't really expensive and therefore no need to compromise. 

They seem to have an identical concept but still the Crown costs three times as much as the Charly. What are the advantages of the crown compared to the charlies? 

I got your question wrong at first. Correctly considered your question is based on a false assumption however. Adult humans don't eat certain food for the simple reason that they can. You would be absolutely surprised how easily a human can change his mind when hungry :) (vegans who hunt become a thing then). For example North Korean people ate grass and tree bark to survive: 

So, to answer the question "Why did the wolf-pack withdraw from attacking me?": the wolves decided that you were not suitable as prey (luckily). 

Despite giving recommendations, they tell you about a lot of details to keep an eye on when purchasing a smartwatch for mountaineering. Thus my advice is to read through it. However, to address your question, I'll narrow down the recommendation list. At the end of the day the current market only lets you decide between these two watches meeting all of your requirements: Garmin Fenix 5 (GPS/GLONASS, battery life 4 weeks, HR) 

It doesn't really matter. The recovery rate of mechanical broadheads is a little bit higher but negligible since the rates are overall extremely good (82 % fixed vs 91 % mechanical). So, if you are used to mechanical broadheads and can afford them, I would recommend to go with them. If you aren't used to them (normally shooting with fixed broadheads), I would recommend to grab the fixed ones. 

Let's assume there's a reason to stay dry from rain. You've a form of a basecamp which can keep you dry. Is it better to walk or to run back through the rain? The crux (imho!): 

tl;dr What you describe is absolutely allowed (using a bivouac to spend one night). If you set up a small camp (described as a "planned bivouac" further in this text), you shouldn't be in a protected area. 

Let's say I shoot 180 fps with a 400 grain arrow. I choose a new shaft and tune it, so that I get a 350 grain arrow. Is there a rule of thumb how many fps adds to the 180? I'm searching for something like the draw weight rule, which says: "Add 5% of the poundage given at 28" per inch draw length." 

I thought about trying unconventional breeds for hunting. I stumbled across the "Akita", which was initially cultured to hunt. However, it seems that it's pretty much a common house/pet dog nowadays (nothing wrong with this of course). How does an Akita do as a hunting buddy? The Japanese Akita: 

Yes! Not a silly question at all and surprisingly easy to answer: yes! There are even sound-systems exactly for that use. 

Each Axis shaft has the "Hidden Insert Technology" (short HIT) and therefore you need a HIT-insert. Normally these shafts are already delivered with such! So be aware that you don't buy additional ones.
