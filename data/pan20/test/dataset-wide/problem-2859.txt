When you hear people in church debasing themselves and saying that they are miserable sinners, it seems contemptible and not worthy of self-respecting human beings. Religion is the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes. Religions are an extremely dangerous doctrine, because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside, the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves. 

I needed the complete citation from the book. I think it was a typo, because I think the question was: why Flat tax isn't so good to society or capitalism's justice. 

A review of standard reference works suggests that there is a broad agreement among such sources that philosophy involves the study of the most fundamental and general concepts and principles involved in thought, action and reality. If it is possible to do philosophy while neglecting the study of mathematics depends of the kind of concepts and principles involved. 

The question of a finite chain of causes of the universe, itself makes no sense. Why is there something rather than nothing? This is an illogical question because impose an impossible explanatory demand, to deduce the existence of something without using any existential premises. One can not give a imaginary definition of attributes of a being as a timeless or out space being or an uncaused being, as proof of existence. If everything has a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just be the universe as God. Of all the approaches to a being’s existence, the deduction is the strategy that we would expect to be successful were there a necessary being. But there are not a valid deduction of a non logical existence, then we can conclude that there is no such necessary being. 

The Rise of Modern Philosophy: A New History of Western Philosophy "An accurate summary of what each of the major figures had to say, and then a perceptive analysis of the philosophical consequences. Kenny makes reading the history of philosophy great fun. It is ideal as the first thing to read for someone new to this wonderfully creative period. Sir Anthony Kenny is one of Britain's most distinguished academic figures. He has been Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford, Master of Balliol College, Chairman of the Board of the British Library, and President of the British Academy. He has published more than forty books on philosophy and history." 

Agnosticism was coined by T. H. Huxley. It was morally repugnant the insistence of the orthodox that their dogmas required sheer unswerving acceptance, and that breakdowns in argument or intelligibility were simply occasions for the exercise of an intensified faith. T. H. Huxley was forthright. In “Agnosticism and Christianity” he wrote, “I, and many other Agnostics, believe that faith, in this sense, is an abomination.” A growing mass of data and theory supplied by the physical sciences was prima facie at variance with biblical history and cosmology. There was the new time scale of geology, the impersonal and amoral Darwinian evolutionary theory, and the radical textual, historical criticism of the Bible itself. For Huxley agnosticism was “not a creed but a method, the essence of which lies in the rigorous application of a single principle”: Reason should be followed “as far as it can take you,” but undemonstrable conclusions should not be treated as if they were certain. Justifying agnosticism as a philosophical position requires a careful investigation of the limits of our cognitive powers. Specifically, it must be shown that human reason is simply incapable of reaching either affirmative or negative judgments concerning the existence of the God of traditional theism. Statements about the god of traditional theism, or other supernatural entities are neither analytic nor empirically verifiable in principle. Naturalism’s basic thesis is that the only things about which reliable knowledge can be obtained are things that can be investigated by the methods of science. The supernatural eludes investigation by the methods of science. Since naturalists tend to hold that the only individual things of whose existence we have reliable knowledge are physical things, the conclusion is drawn that the existence or nonexistence of a god is unknowable, then there are no sufficient truth-conducive reasons to support belief. No one ought to hold a belief on insufficient evidence. Why the believer feels compelled to use the extraordinary language he does use? It has become much unconvincing to use religious experience as an argument to a god’s reality. Naturalistic forms of explanation, have been proposed for religious experience; and analogies are often drawn between religious or mystical experiences and drug induced or pathologically abnormal states of consciousness. Philosophical sense still needs to be made of the connecting of revealed content with the alleged divine source. Religious people say a good many mysterious things about their Absolute, things that, by their own account, were strictly unsayable. Problems arise when it is claimed that ultimate reality or God are altogether beyond all conceptual descriptions. This kind of strict ineffability is incoherent, because to be described as ineffable is itself a description. We have good reason for thinking there can be no such ineffable X ‘out there’. It is very difficult to see what use positing an ultimately ineffable X would have, religiously, practically, philosophically or scientifically. Very few religions rule out in principle all conceptualizing of God, even if they are quite wary of such theorizing, and so philosophers they still engage in conceptual analysis when they are already cut off from the religions they are attempting to explore philosophically. The questions here are not questions of credibility but of conceivability. Notions such as self-existence of a god and creation of universe by an external agency involve symbolic conceptions of the illegitimate and illusive kind. This justify to describe as atheist one who rejects religion on the grounds that talk about a god is unverifiable talk, or that the concept god contains inner illogicalities. 

I think your central question is “Does external exist, and we conceive internally, if we are a brain in the vat? Answer: If we apply the Occam's razor the question is pointless.The maps are not the territory. Suppose a Bizarre Brain, BB, that is, the computer of the "brain in the vat" skepticism, the brain of the Descartes' devil that deceives us, a permanently dreaming brain, or the solipsistic brain that create the "universe" for itself or for us. If the BB makes her mind the object of scientific study, it will find that it behaves with the same complexity as the universe described by a Common Sense Brain, CSB. Thus what CSB calls "the universe", the BB calls "one's own mind." Understood this way, the distinction between CSB and BB collapses and amounts to different ways of describing the same thing: a massively complex process that causes all the BB's experiences. Presumably having made the case that the BB scientist is actually a CSB scientist, the BB applies Occam's Razor, and suggests to the BB scientist to prefer the CSB's standard external “reality” over something like a BB's "reality". This is because the standard "reality" fits all the data available to the scientist, and on the skeptic's hypothesis is impossible to find differences, rendering superfluous the other more complicated possibilities. Unobservables such as atomic particles, the force of gravity, and the quantum physics, are useful representation models. "The brain in the Vat" skepticism and the solipsism are interpretations or models too. Any language which provide a practical way of thinking and make sense about natural laws, a common mind-independent world, must provide a way of expressing common true inductive inferences about this world, or a description that relates representation to prediction. What varies are the models and interpretations, but if they are to be true, what they predict does not change. There is no more an objective basis for choosing one theory/representation over another than there is for preferring the Fahrenheit to the Celsius scale for temperature ascriptions. In an interpretation, it is prediction that remains invariant between different, but equally adequate, theories or representations. If too many of speakers utterances are false, then the link between what speakers say and the world is severed; and the enterprise of interpretation each other halts. Too much error in statements about the world is not an option if speakers are going to translate each other. Therefore prediction is objective in the sense that most of what speakers say about the world are truths about the world. This is an assumption an translator makes because the only path into the world speakers share are the events in the world that cause them to hold those sentences true. Models translation need essentially inter-subjectivity.The maps are not the territory. It is pointless to say "the mountain is disobeying the map". Central ideas of David Deutsch and David Davidson 

What are its pros and cons of speculative philosophy? I think we can interpret speculative or continental philosophy in contrast to analytic philosophy and that the best approach is to consider some famous direct debates between famous analytic and continental philosophers: Reception of Heidegger's philosophy by Analytic and Anglo-American philosophy $URL$ Gilbert Ryle on Heidegger’s Being and Time $URL$ "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" Rudolf Carnap $URL$ The first recorded announcement of the analytic-continental divide in the twentieth century. $URL$ 1958 Royaumont encounter between British and French philosophers $URL$ Sokal affair $URL$ Searle-Derrida debate $URL$ $URL$ Protests against Derrida’s honorary degree in Cambridge $URL$ How rational can a polemic across the analytic-continental 'divide' be? $URL$ 

In 1971 Nagel is probably referring to the supposed refutation of skepticism by Moore. What Nagel and Clarke are saying is that Moore's arguments only prove that common sense is a possible way of describing the world, and they say that other forms are possible and incompatible. Hence the skeptic instead of asking how I justify that common sense is correct, he ask now how to know which among the possible ways of describing the world is the correct one. I personally don't like the skeptic's refutation of Moore, but the refutation via semantic externalism. I don't know Thompson Clarke's references. 

I don't see the “self-refuting”. ‘Scientism’ is a term of abuse. Therefore, perhaps inevitably, there is no one simple characterization of the views of those who are thought to be identified as prone to it. Perhaps open to the charge of scientism is to think that philosophical problems are scientific problems and should only be dealt with as such. A successful accusation of scientism usually relies upon a restrictive conception of the sciences and an optimistic conception of the philosophy as hitherto practiced. Nobody espouses scientism. A proposition is epistemic if and only if it has some implication for what, in some circumstances, is rationally worthy of belief. Scientific's propositions are epistemic propositions. I do not see science as a progress toward THE FINAL TRUTH. Many past theories were not approximately true or truthlike. Ptolemy's geocentric theory was rejected in the Copernican revolution, not retained in the form “approximately Ptolemy”. Indeed, the progressive steps from Ptolemy to Copernicus or from Newton to Einstein are not only matters of improved precision but involve changes in theoretical postulates and laws. There is no theory-independent way to reconstruct phrases like "really there", each theory has its own ontology. Convergence to the truth scientific progress seems to be impossible, if ontologies change with theories observations, and ontologies are relative to theories. Science is progressive only on values other than the truth, such as simplicity, predictive accuracy, comprehensiveness, and requirements for consistency. Scientific theories are hypothetical and always corrigible in principle. They may happen to be true, but we cannot know this for certain in any particular case. 

If there is a pair of coexistent necessarily omniscient and necessarily morally perfect omnipotent agents, then there is a pair of incompatible contingent states of affairs each of which is morally optional for these agents, that is, neither morally prohibited nor morally required for them. If a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents were even possible, then possibly, at a time, t, some omnipotent agent, x, while retaining its omnipotence, endeavors to move a feather, and at t, another omnipotent agent, y, while retaining its omnipotence, endeavors to keep that feather motionless. Intuitively, in this case, neither x nor y would affect the feather as to its motion or rest. Thus, in this case, at t, x would be powerless to move the feather, and at t, y would be powerless to keep the feather motionless! But it is absurd to suppose that an omnipotent agent could lack the power to move a feather or the power to keep it motionless. Therefore, neither x nor y is omnipotent. This line of reasoning appears to reduce the notion of a plurality of coexistent omnipotent agents to absurdity. 

This is the complex question fallacy. Classical example: "Have you stopped beating your wife?" Whether the respondent answers yes or no, they will admit to having a wife, and having beaten her at some time in the past. Two otherwise unrelated points are conjoined and treated as a single proposition. The reader is expected to accept or reject both together, when in reality one is acceptable while the other is not. The fact that a question presupposes something does not in itself make the question fallacious. Only when some of these presuppositions are not necessarily agreed to by the person who is asked the question does the argument containing them become fallacious. Hence the same question may be complex in one context, but not in the other. For example the previous question would not be complex if it was asked during a trial in which the defendant has already admitted to beating their wife. Coping: Identify the propositions illegitimately conjoined and show that believing one does not mean that you have to believe the other.Place the burden on the deceptive questioner either to expose their tactic:"Then please explain, how could I possibly have beaten a wife that I've never had?" Or a short answer: "I neither did nor do I now". Answer the question by reframing it and pointing out the inherent flaws in the premise behind it. Examples: 

Hume challenged other philosophers to come up with a deductive reason for the inductive connection. If the justification of induction cannot be deductive, then it would beg the question. To Hume, induction itself, cannot explain the inductive connection. Wittgenstein's early account of causation in TLP follows Hume in rejecting the idea of causal necessity. There is only one kind of necessity, namely logical necessity; 'outside logic everything is accidental.' This means that there is 'no causal nexus' to justify an inference from the existence of one situation to that of another. Hence, too, there is no 'compulsion' that one thing should happen because another has happened, and we cannot know future events (TLP 5.135-5.1362, 6.3, 6.36311-6.372). In other words, induction (TLP 6.3f.) has only a psychological justification; 'there are no grounds for believing that the simplest eventuality will in fact be realized.' For the 'law of induction', according to which nature is uniform - will carry on the way it has in the past - has no logical justification. Everything outside logic, in the domain of empirical science, is 'accidental'. In particular, causation is neither a real nor a necessary connection between events. Consequently we cannot know that the sun will rise tomorrow. "The events of the future cannot be inferred from those of the present.Superstition is the belief in the causal nexus". For reasoning yields knowledge only if the premises are known to be true and entail the conclusion; but the existence of one situation never entails the existence of another. Wittgenstein supposition is that knowledge requires certainty. Like other so-called 'fundamental' laws of science, the 'law of causality', according to which every event has a cause, is not a law, but 'the form of a law'. This means that it is neither a law of logic, nor an empirical generalization, nor a synthetic a priori proposition. Indeed, it is not a proposition at all, since it tries to say what can only be shown. What it indicates is a certain 'form of description' which is crucial to scientific theorizing (TLP 6.321f.). Descriptions which connect events in a non-lawlike manner are excluded from science. To characterize something as an event is to imply that it is explicable by reference to some often unknown causal law. Causation itself is a formal concept. It characterizes not reality, but the 'network' of an optional form of representing reality, such as Newtonian mechanics (TLP 6.33-6.341, 6.36f., 6.362). Wittgenstein's later thoughts after TLP on causation focuses on the way we establish causal connections in everyday life, not in science, and the results challenge crucial aspects of the Humean position. Wittgenstein makes the claim that the principle of causality, 'Every event must have a cause', is not a synthetic a priori truth, as Kant thought, but a disguised rule of grammar. If this means that our grammar simply rules out as nonsensical the expression 'uncaused event', it is wrong. But one might argue that it is a norm of representation of classical mechanics that it always makes sense to look for the cause of an event, even if no plausible candidate is in sight. 

They are different concepts. Plato in the Theaetetus interprets Protagoras’ doctrine. Plato attributes the doctrine called subjective relativism to Protagoras, that what anyone believes is true for that person, ‘true’ is replaced by ‘true for’. On that interpretation, the way things seem to an individual is the way they are in fact for that individual. If the wind feels cold to me, and I consequently believe that it is cold, there is no objective fact of the matter by reference to which that belief can be false. Subjective relativists argue that truth and falsity of all judgements and the right and wrong of actions are relative to the beliefs and opinions of the individual thinkers. The view entails that the truth and falsity of our judgements come down only to what we believe or like. Subjective relativism rules out the possibility of disagreement and the very distinction between correct and incorrect judgements, for it turns all our judgements, as long as we believe in them, into correct or true ones. Subjective relativism is a notion that may make critical thinking look superfluous. If the doctrine were true, each of us would be infallible. Solipsism is the view that only oneself exists. This formulation covers two doctrines, each of which has been called solipsism, namely (1) that one is the only self, the only centre of consciousness, and, more radically, (2) that nothing at all exists apart from one’s own mind and mental states. These are not always distinguished from corresponding epistemic forms: for all we know, (1) or (2) might be true. Epistemic versions of solipsism are themselves extreme forms of scepticism. In the first type of solipsism, it can be based on the thoughts that one has no direct awareness of the mental states of others, and that to infer that they must have mental states because of the outward resemblance between their bodily behaviour and one’s own is to make an inference based on one case only - not normally regarded as sound inductive procedure. Another, more radical, argument is that one is unable even to form any concept of a state of consciousness that is not one’s own. The second type of solipsism, which finds problematic not just the existence of other minds but of everything other than one’s own mind and mental states, is a very close relation of scepticism about the existence of the external world. Although closely related, it is not the same thing, since a number of philosophers from widely varying traditions have denied the existence - or at least the independent existence - of a material world, while showing no tendency to assert that theirs was the only mind. Berkeley is a prime example, having portrayed the material world as illusory, wrote a treatise explaining why solipsism was not an inevitable consequence.
