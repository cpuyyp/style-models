Credit: Laursen (2010). Only in few cases is the galaxy responsible for the absorption found. This is partly because the light from the quasar outshines everything in its (projected) vicinity, but possibly also because the huge hydrogen cloud is a galaxy in the making, that perhaps hasn't form many stars yet. And since the probabiliy for sightlines toward quasars of hitting a small galaxy is larger than hitting a large galaxy (due to the total cross section of small galaxies being larger), galacitc counterparts of DLAs should tend to be small. Thus, DLAs are thought to probe young galaxies in the process of forming. Other types Other types includes distant red galaxies (DRGs), (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs), and gamma-ray burst host galaxies (GHGs). One of the big challenges of astronomy is to ascertain how the galaxies of the different group fit in some big picture. Is there for instance an evolutionary sequence from DLA→LAE→LBG→SMG→DRG (see e.g. Gawiser 2005)? 

The sizes of dust particles varies enormously, and thus the density of dust particles depend upon which sizes we are talking about. The dust size distribution can be described by a power law with a slope of roughly $-3.5$; that is, the density of 0.1 µm particles of is $10^{-3.5}$ times that of 0.01 µm particles, or roughly 3000 times smaller. Moreover, the discussion is complicated by the fact that we don't really have a formal definition of what is dust. But one "definition" takes the minumum size as a conglomeration of a few molecules, and the maximum size as "what has time to grow in a formation process" (these dust particles can later "stick together" and grow to form pebbles, rocks, asteroids, and planets. That's why any definition will be arbitrary). In a dust-dense region of the interstellar medium, this results in a typical mean density of roughly one dust particle per cubic centimeter. 

Radiation has energy, and energy exerts gravity. You could say that it "strengthens the force of gravity" (it definitely doesn't weaken it), but it would be more appropriate to say that it contributes to the total gravitational field. The effect it immensely small, however, and is in almost all circumstances completely insignificant compared to the gravity of other forms of mass/energy. But most of the radiation in the Universe is the so-called cosmic microwave background, and because this radiation is gradually redshifted with time, it used to be more energetic, and hence exert more gravity. It is fairly easy to calculate that until the Universe was roughly 50,000 years old, radiation actually dominated the gravitational field. Prologue: As Zephyr points out below, the term "exerting gravity" is not really the correct way of describing gravity. In general relativity, objects are assumed follow straight lines in space, unless a force (e.g. electromagnetic) acts upon it. What we interpret as "gravity" is the deviation from what we think is "straight ahead", caused by a geometrical change in the space (and time) — and thus in the mathematical rules we use to calculate e.g. how parallel lines behave, how many degrees there are in a triangle, etc — around a massive object. The deformation of space is given by the Einstein field equations, in which the so-called stress–energy tensor appears. This is a mathematical object consisting of 16 numbers, of which one number (the "$T^{00}$'th component") holds the energy density of everything, i.e. radiation, dark matter, dark energy, stars, planets, bicycles, and — in particular — your mom. 

In principle yes, but in practice no. At the so-called photon sphere, gravity is exactly so strong that a photon on a tangential trajectory would stay in orbit. For a non-rotating black hole of mass $M$, the radius of the photon sphere is $3/2$ times the radius of the event horizon — i.e. the "surface" of the black hole — which itself is given by $r_s \equiv 2GM/c^2$, where $G$ and $c$ are the gravitational constant and the speed of light, respectively. However, the orbits are unstable; any perturbation will cause a photon on the photon sphere to either escape or plunge into the black hole. 

Not really, for the same reason that you cannot travel west by jumping up in the air and let Earth rotate underneath you, such that you land a little farther to the west. The reason is that standing on Earth's surface, you already have a velocity toward the east which matches exactly the speed of the surface. Thus, in the reference frame of Earth, you simply jump up and down. In the same manner, if you use your mad hypothetical spacecraft to fly "up", i.e. away from the Galactic plane, you already have a velocity of $\sim$250 km s$^{-1}$ in the direction of the rotation of the plane, so that in the reference frame of the plane, you simply fly straight up. Apart from this, in order to leave the Galactic plane, you need to fly roughly 500 lightyears. This will take a long time. You should stay home. 

Yes. Theoretically, structure is expected to form first on small scales (stars and stellar clusters), and later on increasingly larger scales — galaxies, groups, and eventually galaxy clusters (see e.g. Longair 2006). This is confirmed, at least to some extent, observationally. For instance, galaxies have been detected out to a redshift of $z=11.2$ (400 million years after Big Bang; Oesch et al. 2016), while cluster have only been detected out to $z=2.5$ (2.6 billion years after Big Bang; Wang et al. 2016). Thus, when clusters formed, the Universe had already expanded so much that interaction between them is rather rare. It does happen, however. One of the most important examples is the Bullet Cluster, which consists of two colliding galaxy clusters. The reason I mention this is that it really beautifully confirmed the existence of dark matter. The image below (from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day) shows the two clusters after the collision. The stars and galaxies are so far apart that collisions between galaxies are rare, and collisions between stars virtually never happen. Thus, they have just passed right through each other, as seen in the image. The gas between the galaxies, however, collides, slows down, and is separated from the galaxies. This heats the gas to millions of degrees, emitting X-rays (seen in red). The blue stuff is a map of the mass distribution, made using gravitational lensing. This mass is clearly separate from the gas, but coincides with the galaxies, and gives a much higher mass than the visible mass, roughly 5.5 times more, which is exactly what is found for the ratio between dark and normal matter using other methods. 

Hence their transmission is in the near infrared ("NIR"), and they're both above 700 Å. The exact transmission curves vary a little depending on the producer, so if you want to calculate exact magnitudes, for instance, you need to find the transmission curves for the telescope in question. From the TRAPPIST equipment website, it seems they use filters from Astrodon. Astrodon don't seem to provide filter curves for these exact filter, but if you're okay with a good approximation, you can find the curves here: Bessel I and Sloan z'. 

Without going into the technicalities of spacetime diagrams and ants, I think the quickest way to wrap your head around this is to look at it from the distant galaxy's perspective. For instance, let's take GN-z11, which actually receded from us at $v\simeq4c$ when it emitted the light we see today: A photon left GN-z11 at $v=c$. Space expands, so although the photon at any time travels locally at $v=c$, it increased its distance to GN-z11 at an ever-increasing speed $v>c$. The Milky Way receded from GN-z11 at $v\simeq4c$, but locally it has $v\simeq0$, and until recently the Universe expanded slower and slower. At some point, the photon reached a point where the Universe expanded at, say, $v=0.1c$ wrt. GN-z11, so the photon receded at $v=1.1c$. Later, it reached a point where the Universe expands at $v=c$ wrt. GN-z11, so it receded at $v=2c$ from GN-z11. And so on. Eventually, it simply "caught up" with the Milky Way. It is important to note, though, that this is only possible because the expansion rate didn't accelerate until recently. The acceleration puts a limit to how fast galaxies may recede and still be visible. Today, that limit happens to be roughly $v=1.2c$, corresponding to galaxies roughly 17 billion lightyears away. Photons leaving GN-z11 today will never reach us, even though it "only" recedes from us at $v=2.2c$ today. 

Mass fractions in the Universe Matter in the Universe is dominated by two components; baryons (i.e. atoms in various forms) and dark matter (DM). The baryons predominantly exist in two forms: gas (including plasma) and stars (some gas condenses to form dust, planets, etc., but that's a minor part). The fraction of the Universe's total energy in the form of matter is $\Omega_\mathrm{M}\simeq0.31$ (most of the rest is dark energy). The baryons and DM have fractions $\Omega_\mathrm{b}=0.05$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{DM}=0.26$, respectively (numbers from Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). Hence, the baryons and DM comprise fractions $f_\mathrm{b} = \Omega_\mathrm{b} / \Omega_\mathrm{M} = 16$% and $f_\mathrm{DM} = \Omega_\mathrm{DM} / \Omega_\mathrm{M} = 84$% of the total mass, respectively. Galaxies have more dark matter than the average Universe Galaxies formed when DM+gas overdensities decoupled from the Hubble flow and started collapsing, and so were "born" with the "cosmic" fractions. However, observationally it is found that the baryon fraction in galaxies is much smaller; for instance, a "typical" Milky Way-sized galaxy roughly has $f_\mathrm{b}$ only half of the cosmic average, and the DM fraction is correspondingly larger, >$90$% (e.g. Werk et al. 2014). Gas and dark matter dynamics The reason is the different mechanisms that affect the dynamics of the particles. Whereas the DM is collisionless, the gas particles collide and dissipate their energy, making it easier to cool and contract. Thus, the part of the galaxies that we can observe is much smaller than "whole" galaxy; the typical "half-light radius" is but a few percent of the emcompassing DM halo (Kravtsov 2013, Somerville et al. 2017). The half-light radius is the radius within which half of the light is emitted; when you see an image of a galaxy, it typically looks perhaps 4-5 times larger than this. So, something like this: 

Yes, time does run slower$^\dagger$ for far-away objects, as observed from our point of view, because they recede from us at high speeds. And yes, because expansion accelerates, this time dilation slowly, very slowly, becomes more pronounced. This is a well-known effect, and is always taken into account when doing observations. For instance, when observing distant supernovae, one is often interested in how their luminosities decrease as a function of time. This is called their lightcurve. In order to compare lightcurves at different redshifts, they are usually converted to their restframe, i.e. how they would look if you were "standing next to the supernova". However, time dilation does not work exactly as you seem to think. At galaxy at a redshift of $z$ has its time dilated by a factor of $1+z$, so time runs twice as slow for a galaxy at, say, $z=3$ than for a galaxy at $z=1$. Galaxies with redshifts larger than $z\sim1.5$ recede faster than the speed of light, and time does not at all stop here. Only for $z\rightarrow\infty$, i.e. at the beginning of time at Big Bang, does the time dilation approach infinity. $^\dagger$EDIT: I originally wrote "faster" instead of "slower" 

The comoving distance is a distance. You can calculate the comoving distance from your head to your toes (though it's more useful in cosmological contexts). It is defined such that today it coincides with the actual, physical distance you would measure if you froze the Universe and laid out meter sticks. In 11 billion years from now, when the Universe has doubled in size, physical (cosmological) distances have increased by a factor of two, but the comoving distances are, by definition, the same. A "horizon" is a term used for a (non-physical) boundary, e.g. the "particle horizon", which is the boundary between the observable and the un-observable Universe. Or the "(cosmological) event horizon", which marks the boundary between regions from which we may at some point receive a signal emitted today, and regions from which we cannot. Just like on Earth it makes sense to talk about "the distance to the horizon", you can say, e.g., "The comoving distance to the particle horizon is 46 billion lightyears", or "The comoving distance to the event horizon is 17 billion lightyears". As you say, to calculate the comoving distance you use the Robertson-Walker metric (assuming here a flat Universe for simplicity) $$ ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 \big[ dr^2 + r^2 d\Omega^2 \big], $$ and set $ds=d\Omega=0$ to measure along a radial null geodesic. Then $dr = c\,dt/a(t)$, or $$ r = c \int_{t_\mathrm{em}}^{t_\mathrm{obs}} \frac{dt}{a(t)}, $$ where $t_\mathrm{em}$ and $t_\mathrm{obs}$ is the time when the light is emitted and observed, respectively. To calculate the comoving distance to the particle horizon, you set $t_\mathrm{em} = 0$ and $t_\mathrm{obs} =$ today, because the particle horizon corresponds to light emitted at Big Bang and observed today. To calculate the comoving distance to the event horizon, you set $t_\mathrm{em} =$ today and $t_\mathrm{obs} = \infty$, because the event horizon corresponds to light emitted today and observed in the (almost) infinitely distant future. 

The three different cases are illustratred below. Keplerian, solid, and flat rotation are drawn in green, red, and blue, respectively. For comparison, a typical spiral galaxy velocity curve is drawn in magenta. 

In other words, you are right that if there were no DM, and if we observed the same thing as we do, then there would be a contradiction. But if there were no DM, we wouldn't see what we see. Therein lies the resolution. 

Galaxies move through space with velocities of the order of a several 100 km per second; small velocities for small groups (~100 km/s; e.g Carlberg et al. 2000) and large velocities for rich clusters (~1000 km/s; e.g Girardi et al. 1993). In addition to this so-called "peculiar velocity", galaxies also also carried away from each other due to the expansion of the Universe, at a velocity proportional to the distance from each other (the "Hubble flow"). But this is not a motion through space; rather it is space itself that is expanding (and hence the velocity may exceed the speed of light for sufficiently large distances). One may define a "global reference frame" with respect to which velocities are measured. Any reference is valid, but it makes sense to use the frame in which all galaxies are, on average, in rest (when the Hubble flow is subtracted)$^\dagger$. In this frame, the Milky Way's local galaxy group has a velocity of 627 ± 22 km/s (Kogut et al. 1993). 

It's dust! The black band is not absence of stars, but rather clouds of gas and dust — a significant component of almost all spiral galaxies$^\dagger$ — which block the light of background stars and luminous gas. In the image, you see both individual stars, scattered all over, and the distinctive bright band of the Milky Way, most of the stars of which are so far away that they blend together. Most of the dust is in the plane of the Milky Way. The individual stars are closer to us than the bright band and the dust clouds, so what you see is the billions of stars in the Milky Way band, some of the light of which is blocked by dust, and then on top of this you see a few 1000s individual stars that are closer. The components of galaxies Galaxies consist of roughly 85% dark matter and 15% normal ("baryonic") matter. By far, most of the normal matter is hydrogen and helium, some of which is locked up in stars, and some of it in huge gas clouds, sometimes glowing (the pink clouds you see in the Milky Way image are probably hydrogen clouds being excited by the hard UV radiation from hot and massive stars, subsequently emitting H$\alpha$ light). A small fraction (1–2%) of the normal matter are heavier elements, by astronomers lazily referred to as "metals". Roughly 2/3 of the metals are in the gas phase, but the remaining 1/3 has depleted into dust grains, e.g. silicates and soot. This dust is mixed with the gas clouds and often become dense enough that they block light of stars. A strong wavelength dependence of the dust's extinction properties However, dust scatters and absorbs light with short wavelengths (such as blue and UV) much more efficiently than long wavelengths (such as red and infrared). So while it may effectively block visual and UV light, infrared light passes more or less unhindered. For instance, if you look at the molecular cloud Barnard 68 in red and near-infrared, it looks black (left in the image below), but if you look farther out in the infrared, you can actually see the background stars (right below): 

$\pi$ is just a number. It doesn't vary with anything. The ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle varies with geometry, so in the general case, this definition doesn't hold. But there are other definitions, such as $$ \pi = \int_{-1}^{1}\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}, $$ or $$ \mathrm{The\,smallest\,positive\,number} \, x \, \mathrm{for\,which}\, \arccos(2x) = 0. $$ The latter definition can also be expressed a power series, which is independent of geometry.
