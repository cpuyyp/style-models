The answer is yes. Actualy Rouche's theorem is valid for smooth functions if instead of the number of zeros you count the signed number. (I suppose that this is what you want to count). That is the zero with positive Jacobian is counted with + and zero with negative Jacobian is counted with -. This is called the topological degree. 

Without the deep theorem of Nash-Kuiper, it is easy to construct and visualize a bi-Lipschitz embedding: think of those Dutch collars of the XVII century like this: $URL$ 

The answer to the first question is "yes". This is called conformal gluing, and the proof is based on the following lemma due to Lavrentiev: Let $\phi$ be an increasing diffeomorphism of $[-1,1]$ onto itself. Then there is a simple curve in the unit disk connecting $-1$ and $1$ breaking the disk into two domains $D^+$ (above) and $D^-$ (below), so that there exist conformal maps $f_1$ from the upper half-disk to $D_+$ and $f_2$ from the lower half-disk to $D^-$ which satisfy $f_1\circ\phi(z)=f_2(z)$ for $z\in [-1,1]$. For a beautiful proof, see Goluzin, Geometric theory of functions of a complex variable, (English translation: AMS 1969), Chapter 11. The condition that $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism can be substantially relaxed (See Ahlfors, Lectures on quasiconformal mappings, Chap IV, where this is called $M$-condition, modern term is "quasisymmetric"), but for arbitrary homeomorphisms this is not true. The answer to the other two questions is no. The procedure that you describe is called the Schiffer variation of conformal structure, and it indeed changes the conformal structure (of the resulting compact surface). See for example, S. Nag, Schiffer variation of complex structure and coordinates on Teichmuller spaces, Proc. Indian Acad. Sci., 94 (1985) 2-3, p. 111-122. The original source is M. Shiffer and D. Spencer, Functionals of finite Riemann surfaces. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N. J., 1954. 

For real functions whose domain is a real interval, it is necessary and sufficient that the second derivative is a function of bounded variation on every compact interval in the domain. Or, in terms of distributions, the second derivative must be a measure (a difference of two non-negative measures). 

For seeing immediately that such conjectures cannot be true, it is useful to keep in mind Runge's theorem: every analytic function on a compact set which does not divide the plane is uniform limit of polynomials. Application of Runge always gives sufficiently generic examples: an open set. 

For a beginning mathematician, the best advice is to follow the adviser's recommendation in the journal choice. Considering the reputation of a journal, there are many ratings, for example, Mathscinet journal citation database. Another advise, look what kind of papers are published there. Look where the people you cite publish their papers. If the journal is not in your library, this is an indication of the too high price, and you probably do not want to publish in such a journal. 

There are plenty of journals which charge no fees, and online access is free. I am surprised that nobody mentioned the Bulletin of the AMS. Some other examples are Conformal Geometry and Dynamics (electronic only): $URL$ Journal of mathematical Physics, analysis and geometry (only electronic version is free), $URL$ All these are peer-reviewed and actually of high quality. 

In the beginning you say that your $x_k$ and $y_k$ are complex. Then most of the time you assume them to be real, call them "extrema", etc. Anyway, if I understand correctly, you are asking for a polynomial whose ALL critical points and critical values are prescribed. (If $P'(x)=0$ then $x$ is called a critical point and $P(x)$ is called critical value). This problem in general has no solutions. Indeed, a polynomial of degree $n$ depends on $n+1$ parameters, and has $n-1$ critical points and $n-1$ critical values, together you want to satisfy $2n-2$ conditions, which is impossible when $n>1$. What is possible in general is to prescribe EITHER the critical points or critical values (and 2 parameters will remain free). If all critical points and critical values are real, there is the exact condition that critical values must satisfy. Assuming for simlicity that critical points are simple, denote them by $x_1\leq x_2\leq\ldots\leq x_{n-1}$. Then the necessary and sufficient condition the critical values $y_k=P(x_k)$ must satisfy is $(y_k-y_{k-1})(y_{k+1}-y_k)<0$. So some critical values can be equal, contrary to what you say. One can obtain similar necessary and sufficient condition with multiple critical points. 

There are (at least) 2 kinds of proofs: analytic ones (which use the existence of Abelian differentials with certain properties) and algebraic ones. The proofs of the first kind use powerful analytic machinery, so it is a question what are you willing to accept as prerequisites. The simplest analytic proof that I know is in Hurwitz-Courant (exists in German and Russian, but unfortunately not in English). Of course all prerequisites are in the same book, starting from definition of complex numbers. The proof of the Riemann-Roch itself is about 1 page, once existence of Abelian differentials is established. The simplest algebraic proof that I know is in Lang's book Algebraic and Abelian functions, which is almost self-contained (refers only to Algebra book of the same author). 

On your last remark. The subject is out of fasion, so modern books do not treat it. There are just too many Riemann surfaces to have an interesting classification of all of them. So the research is concentrated on various special classes that have some applications. For example, on hyperelliptic surfaces (those obtained as a 2-sheeted ramified covering of the plane); Such surfaces occur in mathematical physics. Another interesting class which is studied is Abelian coverings of compact surfaces. 

Alexandr Solynin told me that he solved this problem (even the more general one, for hyperbolic n-gons with all zero angles) in 1993. A. Solynin, Some extremal problems for circular polygons, (Russian) Zapiski Nauchnyh Seminarov POMI 206, 1993, 127-136. English translation is in Journal of Math Sci. 80 4, 1996, 1956-1961. 

An entire function cannot be a covering map, unless $f(z)=az+b$ with $a\neq 0$. Indeed, the complex plane is simply connected, so every covering of the plane is a bijection, and the ony entire functions that are bijections are polynomials of degree $1$. In general, let $f:S\to S$ be a holomorhic map between Riemann surfaces. Then either $f$ is a covering map, or it has a critical point or it has an asymptotic curve. An asymptotic curve $\gamma:[0,1)\to S$ is such a curve that a) for every compact $K\in S$ there exists $t_0\in(0,1)$ such that $\gamma(t)\cap K=\emptyset$ for $t\in (t_0,1)$ and b) There exists a limit $\lim f(\gamma(t))\in S$. This limit is called an asymptotic value. EDIT. Example $f(z)=\int_0^z e^{-\zeta^2}d\zeta$ is surjective, so the image is $C$, and $f'(z)\neq 0$ but this is not a covering: it has two asymptotic values. 

It does not hold in general, as Benoit Kloeckner explained. More precisely, there are two obstacles, one local and one global. The local obstacle is the Gaussian curvature, $-e^{-2u}\Delta u$. It must be zero for the pull-back of the Euclidean metric (which means that $u$ must be harmonic). But there is also a global obstacle. For a given metric of zero curvature on the disc, there exists a conformal local homeomorphism to the plane such that your metric is the pull-back of the Euclidean metric. However this local homeomorphism is not necessary a global homeomorphism. There are Euclidean surfaces conformally equivalent to the unit disc but not isometric to any region in the plane. 

MR1075991 Abhyankar, Shreeram S. Algebraic geometry for scientists and engineers. AMS Providence, RI, 1990. It is really for scientists and engineers. Another excellent choice is D. Cox J. Little and D. O'Shea, Ideals, varieties, and algorithms. An introduction to computational algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics. Springer, New York, 2007. Griffiths Harris is far too difficult, especially for "non-mathematician". Shafarevich is OK for a beginner but beginner-mathematician. EDIT. B. Hassett, Introduction to AG, Cambridge 2007 is a very short book in the spirit of Cox, Little and O'Shea, aimed at undergraduates. Grobner bases are emphasized. Another excellent book, in a very different style (classical geometry) is J. Harris, AG. A first course, Springer, 1992, 1995. 

Your condition $\dim M>2$ does not save the situation: you can have many counterexamples with $M=M'\times C^n$ where $\dim M'=1$ and your functions are independent of the second variable. And in dimension $1$ you certainly have plenty of pluriharmonic (=harmonic) functions which do not extend anywhere. 

The "formula" is this. Let $j(z)$ be that $j$ for which $|f_j(z)|$ is maximal among all $|f_k(z)|$. (There can be several $j$ with this property, choose one, or just remove from your set several functions, to make this $j(z)$ unique). Then $j(z)$ is locally constant on some open set, the boundary of this open set consists of analytic curves which can meet at isolated points. If $m$ and $k$ are two values of $j(z)$ on the right and the left of such a curve, which means that $|f_n(z)|=|f_m(z)|$ on the curve, while $|f_m(z)|$ is the largest one on the left, and $|f_n|$ on the right, then the density of the Riesz measure on this curve (with respect to the arclength) is equal to $$\frac{1}{2\pi}|(d/dn)\log|f_n(z)|-(d/dn)\log|f_m(z)||$$ where $d/dn$ is the derivative along the normal to the curve. The direction of the normal in this formula can be chosen arbitrarily, but the same in both summands. In other words, this is the jump of the directional derivative of $\max_k\log|f_k|$, in the direction normal to the curve on which this $\max$ is not smooth. All this is easy to prove, and people frequently use this, see, for example, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 140, (2012) 1397-1402, formula (7), but there is no convenient reference where this fact is stated. People either prove this, in the situation where they need it, or say that this is evident, or well-known. I've seen this formula as an exercise in some Russian book, but I do not remember which book. (There was no proof anyway). Of course, the gradient of $\log|f|$ is $|f'/f|$ but here we deal not with the gradient but with the derivative in the normal direction of the curve. But of course you can produce from the above formula a formula which is more convenient for your purpose. 

The gluing does not necessarily exist, neither it is unique when exists, in such generality as stated. (I am not even speaking of what the "boundary" of a Riemann surface could mean in general). Even in the simplest case when two original surfaces are disks, the glueing does not have to exist for an arbitrary homeomorphism. In addition to the articles of Hamilton suggested in the previous message, I recommend the web site of Christopher Bishop, and old papers by Alfred Huber (in German). 

EDIT. My previous answer was incorrect. So I replace it. The answer is no. A counterexample is $$y^{2m}+(z^{m-1}y-x^m)^2.$$ This is of degree $2m$ but $\delta$ is like $\epsilon^{2m^2}$ near the point $(0,0,1)$. I found this example in the paper of Kollar and Shiffman, TAMS 329 (1992), on the very first page. They credit it to Lojasiewicz himself, IHES, Bures-sur-Yvette, 1965. I do not know how to find this IHES preprint, but Kollar and Shiffman is available to everyone online. 

Your first integral is $|A|$ (volume), and similarly the other integrals. Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies $|A\cap B|^2\leq |A||B|$ and nothing else can be said. Your inequality with 3 sets is not true. Take $A,B,C$ independent. That is the volume of each product set is equal to the product of the volumes. Such sets can be easily constructed, and can have any given volumes. Then your inequality says $$|A\cap B\cap C||B|\leq |A||A\cap B||A\cap C|,$$ that is $$|A||B|^2|C|\leq |A|^3|B||C|,$$ that is $|B|\leq|A|^2$, which is in general not true. 

Let $g$ be the inverse function to $f$, and $w=f(z)$, so that $g(w)=z$. Let $h$ be the automorphism of the disc sending $0$ to $w$. Then $g\circ h$ sends $0$ to $z$. Then by Koebe $1/4$ theorem $$dist(g(w),\partial\Omega)\geq (1/4)|(g\circ h)'(0)|=(1/4)|g'(w)||h'(0)|.$$ We estimate $|g'(w)|$ by the Koebe distortion theorem which gives $|g'(w)|\geq |g'(0)|(1-|w|)/8.$ Then we compute $|h'(0)|=1-|w|^2\geq 1-|w|$. Finally we estimate $|g'(0)|$ from below using Schwarz's Lemma: $|g'(0)|=1/|f'(0)|\geq R$, where $R$ is the distance from $0$ to $\partial \Omega$. Combining all these estimates, we obtain $$dist(z,\partial\Omega)\geq (R/32)(1-|w|)^2.$$ 

The space $L^2(a,b)$ is a Hilbert space of infinite dimension. Therefore there is an element $f\neq 0$ of this space which is orthogonal to $e^{i\lambda_j x}$. Take this $f$. You can also find such $f$ is any finite dimensional subspace whose dimension is $>n$. Just choose a basis and solve a system of linear equations. 

As Aaron Hoffman pointed out, all trajectories lie on the level lines of $p^2+x^2+(2/3)x^3=c$. The LHS has two critical points: the local minimum $(0,0)$ with critical value $c=0$, and the saddle $(-1,0)$ with critical value $c=1/3$. The behavior for large $(x,p)$ is also clear. So it is easy to sketch all these level lines, and the conclusion is that the trajectory starting from $(x_0,0)$ is bounded if and only if $x_0^2+(2/3)x_0^3\leq 1/3$, and closed when this inequality is strict. For $x_0=0.5$ we obtain that the trajectory is not really closed, but tends to $(-1,0)$ as time goes to infinity. You cannot detect this on computer because the point $(-1,0)$ is unstable. It takes infinite time to approach it on the trajectory, but once you miss, no matter how little, you will be either on a closed trajectory or escape to infty. And it will take you long time to find out, if you miss very little. EDIT. By the way, this system is called the classical anharmonic oscillator. An explicit solution in elliptic functions exists, but physicists prefer to consider perturbative expansions. See, for example, L. Landau and E. Lifshitz, Mechanics (Course of Theoretical Physics, vol. I). 

Everything depends on the meaning of the word "analytical". In the common usage there is a word "analytic", which means "can be expanded in a convergent power series". Then there is a general theorem: if you have a differential equation $y'=F(y)$, where $y$ is a function with values in $R^n$, and $F$ is an analytic function (in your case, $F$ is a polynomial of degree $2$), then for every $t_0$ and every $y_0$, there exists a solution with the property $y(t_0)=y_0$, which is analytic in some neighborhood of $t_0$. The neighborhood depends on $F$ and on $y_0$. However I suspect that your word "analytical" means some kind of "explicit formula". Of course, this has to be defined exactly, but if you are looking for solutions in terms of functions that contain algebraic functions, exponentials, logarithms, any sums, products, ratios or superpositions of the above and integrals of the above, then the answer is no. Example: $$y_1'=y_1^2+y_2,\quad y_2^\prime=1.$$ This is equivalent to the single equation $y'=y^2+t+C,$ and J. Liouville proved in XIX century that it has no solutions of the type described above. 

Let $M$ be the closed unit disk in the plane. Let $f$ be a diffeomorphism of $M$ onto a smooth Jordan region $D$ in the plane. If $D$ is not convex, we can easily arrange that the average $$\int_{\partial{M}}f(z)ds$$ does not belong to $\overline{D}$. This implies that the harmonic extension $F$ of $f$ maps some interior points of the unit disk $M$ to points outside $D$. Let $z_0$ be some point in the interior of $M$ such that $F(z_0)\in\partial F(M)\backslash \overline{D}$. Evidently, $F$ is not an immersion at this point. Remark. It is a classical theorem of Rado, Kneser and Choquet that if $D$ is convex then $F$ is a diffeomorphism inside $M$. I have not looked in their papers, but I am sure this example must be there. 

This proof was new to me when I read it:-) The standard proof, which I teach, and which is given in most books uses Harnack's inequality, which follows from Poisson's formula for the ball, or Poisson's formula directly. If I were the editor or a referee, I would accept this paper. 

Since you are talking about gravitation (rather than electrostatics) I assume that all charges are positive. (With charges of different sign it is easy to arrange a whole curve of equilibrium points). It is certainly non-zero if the number of points is at least 2. (From very general consideration it must be at least $N-1$ if you count multiplicitis properly. Without counting multiplicities it can be $1$ for any $N$). But an exact upper estimate is not known. J. C. Maxwell conjectured that is is at most $(N-1)^2$, but this is wide open. Even finiteness is not known. I know only computer-assisted proof for $N=3$ but I have not checked it. If one assumes finiteness, then there are upper estimates but they are much worse than expected. Reference: $URL$ 

Logistic map is semi-conjugate to the shift. If $F(t)=-(1/2)\cos 2\pi t+1/2$ then $F(2t)=f\circ F(t)$ where $f$ is your logistic map. To the point $1/2$ correspond $t_1=1/4$ and $t_2=3/4$, and $t\mapsto 2t$ just cuts the first digit of the dyadic expansion. Therefore, if you want your orbit of $T_0$ to visit every neighborhood of $t_1$ or $t_2$ infinitely many times, it is necessary and sufficient that the dyadic expansion of $t$ contains sequences $001000000...$ or $011000000...$ with arbitrary many zeros in the tail.
