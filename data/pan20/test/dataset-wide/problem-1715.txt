Repair your network adapter (let me know if you need me to tell you how this is done) In a command prompt on the XP machine type ipconfig /flush dns. 

No - if you require a machine which can handle multiple remote RDP connections you need to purchase a server Operating System combined with Terminal services with the correct ammount of licenses for users. Any attempt to hack/slash your Windows XP machine is not recomended for obvious reasons, not to mention as Sergey said you will have violated your License agreement with Microsoft. 

In terms of DHCP not assigning new leases. Check to make sure your scope is infact Authorised, the DHCP server service is started. Windows WILL let another DHCP server win everytime and stop it's own service. It is worth checking your event logs to see if the DHCP server is reporting any warning or errors, you might also find that your scope is full. I hope this helps, let me know if you have any further issues. 

Which Juniper product are you using would be a good start for anyone to help you. I think your trying to say your being blocked by a webfilter hosted on Juniper equipment? Are you an administrator or a user trying to bypass the system? 

The correct $HOME variable was set and the puppet update worked. The 'user' parameter in vcsrepo refers to the user used to authenticate to the mercurial remote server, not the user who runs the process on the local server. 

There is nothing there, and the server is telling me the /var/log/btmp file starts 14 days ago. There is one other archived btmp log files in /var/log/ 

I have 2 AWS accounts and have set up cross account authentication using IAM roles. I have created a AWS CLI named profile for the second account, which uses a role_arn and specifies my default profile as the source_profile. For my default profile, I keep my KEY and SECRET as environment variables, rather than as static strings in the ~/.aws/credentials file. However, when I switch to the named profile, and query the API, I get the following error: 

Is there any way I can get a named profile to refer to my environment variable credentials rather than static credentials in ~/.aws/credentials? 

I've done quite a bit of research on this over the last month or so. My conclusion is that unless you use the Skype Tools for Active Directory, or are in a position to use a Proxy server for all your Internet traffic, Skype is not a good corporate solution. This is because Skype performance cannot be guaranteed in environments using Port Address Translation $URL$ Quote from Skype Administrators Guide: 2.2.4 Relays If a Skype client can’t communicate directly with another client, it will find the appropriate relays for the connection and call traffic. The nodes will then try connecting directly to the relays. They distribute media and signalling information between multiple relays for fault tolerance purposes. The relay nodes forward traffic between the ordinary nodes. Skype communication (IM, voice, video, file transfer) maintains its encryption end-to-end between the two nodes, even with relay nodes inserted. As with supernodes, most business users are rarely relays, as relays must be reachable directly from the internet. Skype software minimizes disruption to the relay node’s performance by limiting the amount of bandwidth transferred per relay session. ie regardless of what bandwidth you have, when using PAT, you will still be dependent on resources over which you have no control. 

Try www.mxtoolbox.com it has a simple blacklist checker which should be able to detect any blacklists that your on! What are you settings in hmail for outgoing email? 

No. This is a security feature built into server 2008. You can open an elevated prompt by simply right clicking the CMD program icon and selecting run as administrator. (provided you are in fact an administrator!) 

Please see my question, I think I had the same initial issues as you where on 2008 DNS Changes to DHCP assigned hosts were not seen/updated. The commented KB fixed this issue. 

How many domain controllers do you have and how many sites do you have? If several sites what are the link speeds like? 

You will now need to open an additional mailbox in Outlook you can do this by going into account properties in Outlook opening the existing users account, going into option and adding the additional mailbox in there. Let me know if you need anything else. 

You need to run the cmd prompt as an administrator. By default you will not have the correct rights to do this. 

Can anyone tell me what is going on here? My aim is to prove that there have been no invalid login attempts in the 261 days the server has been up, but lastb doesn't appear to be able to confirm this. 

Boto has a function, update_environment, that allows the user to update options in an AWS ElasticBeanstalk environment. Using the AWS CLI, this would typically be actioned as follows: 

2 x ip addresses with 2 individual certs, with each one attached to an ip address A wildcard certificate that works with both domains 

I am trying to deploy a Rails application in the Phusion-Passenger Docker image: $URL$ The Gemfile for the application specifies Ruby version 2.3.1, but the image comes with 2.2.5 by default, so bundle install fails. I've read the documentation a couple of times, but it isn't clear to me if it is possible to user a different major/minor version of Ruby with this image. I have tried the following in the Dockerfile 

Amazon Linux (Linux distro used in Amazon EC2) $URL$ Issue Overview: A missing bounds check was found in the way OpenSSL handled TLS heartbeat extension packets. This flaw could be used to reveal up to 64k of memory from a connected client or server. Affected Versions: Any Amazon Linux AMI on which openssl 1.0.1 is installed, which is any Amazon Linux AMI 2013.03 or later, and any Amazon Linux AMI that has upgraded to 2013.03 or later. OpenSSL is installed by default on the Amazon Linux AMI. Affected Packages: openssl Issue Correction: Run yum update openssl to update your system. Once the new package is installed, it is required that you either manually restart all services that are using openssl, or that you reboot your instance. While the new package is still named openssl-1.0.1e, it does contain the fix for CVE-2014-0160. New Packages: i686: 

You could look into using WSUS, combining it with group policy to force your update settings onto your servers. Please see the following website as it has quite helpful information: $URL$ 

Once this has been done look for lines which contain :25 if any exist the application is correct and we need to look more closly at the software running on the box. If not the software is not accurate. EDIT Now you have checked and found a line showing port 25 is infact open on your machine, we need to see what that process is. 

Any idea's would be great EDIT: Please see my comment below - I appreciate my question could have been misleading I know that best practice is to use a static IP. The alternative is to use a DHCP range printing direct to hostname. The KB - KB967363 resolves my issue - thank you to those who tried to help. 

you said you can access internal stuff but not external. it could just simply be a proxy server? Check your internet explorer options underneath connectivity! let me know how you get on! 

For both providers, the TTL on the NS records in 0, while the NS records at the TLD Registrar level point to the name servers of Provider1. When I change the NS records in the zone at Provider1, I can see this reflected in NS queries almost immediately (using 'dig example.com ns'). However, when I send a query for an A record, ie 

There are various ways to trigger a Jenkins job from an SCM like Bitbucket, but what I want to do specifically is trigger a build using the branch that is the source of the Pull Request. Up to now, we have used the Bitbucket Pull Request Builder, but it is very flaky and unreliable, and not supported well. $URL$ Bitbucket do supply quite good features in terms of Webhooks, which when used with the Jenkins Git Plugin, do allow for triggering of builds based on various Bitbucket events (eg a Pull Request update). There is also the Bitbucket Webhook plugin, but again that doesn't offer much in terms of dynamically choosing the branch you want to build. $URL$ However, what this seems to do is trigger a poll of the repo, where is then tries to build any branch that is different from the main branch. Our use case is that we allow developers create their own branches, for which they then create Pull Requests to the development branch. There doesn't seem to be any way to trigger a build that uses the developer created branch as the build branch (other than the aforementioned Bitbucket Pull Request Builder). Am I right or wrong in this? 

Provided that you have enough user cal's for the number of users you have, you are in compliance. You can check this by checking licensing under server manager. 

The first thing that comes to mind would be, how is what is the logging mode set as on your database? If you change it to simple it should reduce the size of this. This link may help: $URL$ 

If you are looking for a beginning into the world of Windows Server, it may be worth looking at Microsoft's small buisness server. It provides: Domain Controller, DHCP/DNS, File serving, Exchange (Microsoft's Email Server) and much more all under one package. - The OS is heavily wizzard driven to make tasks simpler. I'm a windows server tech so I couldnt tell you too much about *nix systems. Hope this helps some. 

this is quite subjective but wouldnt setting up an FTP server suit your needs better? Possibly try FileZilla Server. If you are hosting files also then apache wouldnt be a bad choice for you. 

Your problem is that Telnet is not installed by default on Server 2008 machines. (Or Windows 7 for that matter). To resolve you will need to open up Server Manager and enable Telnet Client as a feature. If you need any more help please let me know. 

I have a farm of production mysql servers that are currently protected by restricted passwords. I would prefer to restrict access to these systems at network level, but have to account for the fact that some members of the dev community require read only access to debug applications issues. I know that I can do this by creating mysql users that can authenticate at different levels from different ip subnets (eg 'user'@'10.0.0.8') but I'd like to avoid having to refactor code to introduce new users into the application (which would require a considerable QA effort). Ideally, I just want to break the network link between where the mysql servers are (in a dedicated subnet) and the developers are (in a dedicated subnet) and allow the application servers continue to access the mysql servers as before. It would seem like some sort of TCP based proxy with authentication would suit this purpose. In that way, I could create user specific accounts on the proxy that would create an audit trail and provide short-term on demand access to developers without having to tinker with the user database on the MySQL servers. However, authentication options in software like HAProxy and MySQL proxy appear quite limited. Has anyone implemented something similar? 

I have a slightly oddball question, I have a Windows 2008 DC running DHCP and DNS, the problem I have is: 1 - HP Multifunction Printer connected to network picks up DHCP IP Address 

The secretaries will be able to send to the list provided they are sending as the manager. They should not be able to send messages to the Distrubtion list otherwise! I hope this helps you out. 

Is the server a 2003 sbs server or a standard/enterprise? The first thing you need to do is make sure migrating your hardware will conform with Microsoft licensing requirements. You need to check if your OS is OEM or Retail, if its OEM it dies with the hardware if its retail you should be ok. Is this server a domain controller? You will need to check the folder structure and the standard that was setup when the server was brought into action. If you can let me know the answers to the above I can edit my answer with a solution for you. 

It is a SBS server, it is designed to do all of the above. I have seen many servers where customers have skimped on the spec but they still run perfectly fine! If you are looking to remove and disable features you may aswell rip off the SBS os and install 2003/2008 Standard. ****Please note if the SBS server does not have all the FSMO roles it WILL shutdown frequently and be very unhelpfull!!***** I would look at what is eating the CPU and RAM, it makes sense to check that first and go from there. It would also be worth while checking the C: drive to see how much space is remaining. You could always attempt on offline filesystem defrag 

Have managed to test this and I can confirm that it does work. Whereas ElasticBeanstalk assumes that your Dockerfile will build on and add to the base image, it is not actually necessary to do this. The Dockerfile can simple refer to the base image your want to use (eg in the AWS ECR) and the port you want to expose when it is deployed to the ElasticBeankstalk instance. This then allows you to use ebextensions in a Single Container Docker environment. 

Take a look at Dan J Bernstein's daemontools. It can monitor any process and restart it instantly if it fails. Perfect for keeping things like tunnels alive. You can set it up in 5 minutes. $URL$ For a simple HOWTO, check: $URL$ 

Must people who are tricking around with it for the first time will run it on a single server, and then spend days trying to figure out why the health goes yellow due to unassigned shards. 

However, when the user tries to upload a file using SCP, they can't, as the dev_login script is interrupting the process. Is it possible to use the 

I think you will find it hard to find a linux based mirror of your Exchange solution, if not impossible (unless you excel in nix based OS) If you have any questions let me know, I am happy to help you where I can. UPDATE I have just re-read your question, I assumed you are using SBS2003. Could you please confirm your Server OS? If you are not using SBS2003 you should be able to add another mailbox store and migrate your heavy users over to it. 

open Exchange Management Console Expand Recipient Configuration Click Mailbox Right Click the User and "Manager Full Access Permission" Click add, find the user and hit OK, then click manage and finsih. 

The SSL Certificate option which your looking for is called SAN (Subject Alternative Names) It will allow you to add the local hostname alongside the external url. You can pick them up from Globalsign and is asked as part of the certificate request. I hope this helps you. 

I assume this is a DLINK router, and your using cable internet connection? Can you ping the router? you may find you need to power down the modem if it is cable at the mains then power back on whilst the nic is connected to the router.
