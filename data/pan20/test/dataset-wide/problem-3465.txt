Is there any great economic structural reforms, which date back to the Middle Ages or to the Ancient times? 

As you can see, the information criterion (AIC) differs and the $log(L)$, too. My question is, why do they differ in the two model? I'm looking forward to any answer. 

I'm trying to reproduce Gertler-Karádi (2013) model. How far-fetched is the thought to use the amount of corporate bond as an input of production? 

How will Trump’s tariffs affect North Korea? Do tariffs mainly worsen the condition of the North Korean economy? 

Demand shock ($m, n > 0$) Supply shock ($m > 0, n < 0$) Monetary policy shock ($m, n < 0$) Technology shock ($m > 0, n < 0$) 

Given a standard Cobb-Douglas production function: $$Y_t=(A_t L_t)^{\alpha} K_t^{1-\alpha}$$ Moreover, the production function has constant returns to scale: $$\alpha + (1-\alpha)=1$$ How to estimate the output elasticity of labour ($\alpha$) and the output elasticity of capital $(1-\alpha)$? I would like to estimate the output elasticity of labour and capital for a specific group of countries (US, Germany, Korea, Japan) for my RBC model. 

I studied at BA level, that ARIMA(0,1,0) on $y_t$ and ARIMA(0,0,0) on diff($y_t$) are the same models. I am doing the Box–Jenkins model estimation on the historic data of US unemployment rate. My results (in R): 

I don't think different prices make the supply curve shift according to Keynes. Rather the price-change will cause unemployment! Read more about this here: In classical macroeconomics, why Labor supply responds to real wages and not money wages? 

I'd like to read more about the recruiting process of firms. Signalling theory and game theory can be a useful tool to better understand this phenomena. For example: 

You’re right, the migration of workers boost the economy. It’s a stylized fact. It may have political consequences, though, but it is not the part of the analysis of economics. Let’s consider $A$ the set of active labour force of an economy before, and $A'$ after the migration. Then $A$ is the subset of $A'$: $$A \subseteq A'$$ This notation means that the social planner of the economy is able to optimize on a greater number of workers. We can assume that opening the door for migrant workers is at least as good as it was before migration: $$A \preceq A'$$ If this condition is not true (e.g. the migrants doesn't want to work), the authorities of the economy won't open borders for migrant workers. You're considering the effect when the nation itself does not have full employment. This condition is not important. The nation could have 0% unemployment, however, the migrant workers would still get jobs. 

I found many organizational answers to this question: improve communication between agents, introduce shorter contracts, improve on-site execution, etc. However, I personally think internalization would be a great choice: bringing together the agents (like Elon Musk did at Tesla). Then the agents could optimize on a vaster decision set, and the result would be Pareto-efficient. The big question is: how? My question is: how can a decision maker improve the construction productivity? What would be the answer from an Economist point of view? 

Let's assume a standard regression model: $$y=\beta x+u$$ We'd like to test if an variable $x_j$ is relevant in the respect of the model. t-statistics: $$t=\frac{\hat{\beta_j}-b}{SE(\hat{\beta_j})}$$ Most of the time, we assume the following two-tailed hypothesis: $$H_0: \beta_j=b, \ H_1: \beta_j \neq b$$ My question is, why don't we use more often the one-tailed hypothesis to test the significance of a variable $x_j$? When I read papers and write assignments I hardly ever come across one-tailed t-tests in the respect to regression models. Why? 

Are you interested in inequality? I highly recommend this database made by Thomas Piketty. Here's his TED lecture on the topic, too. 

NBA stars create more money (ticket prices, jersey sales, merchandising, branding). However, only few basketball players play in the NBA, the 99% of basketball players are amateurs. But all the doctors earn realitively well. 

Because of the higher costs firm must raise their prices, which definitely leads to inflation. As well as, higher marginal costs lead to higher marginal profits. 

Is it possible to tell anything about market structure if I have annual price data of the industries? Here's the time-series plot on a single graph: 

Therefore, the nation's companies make more money, and this causes the economy to grow. Growth and R&D may also improve by means of brain-drain effect, because there are migrant scientists and white-collar workers, too. 

I heard in a lecture at my university, that measure theory is applied in finance. This field also operates with negative probabilities a lot. Anyways, I don't see the practical intuition behind using negative probabilities in a bond-pricing model. You can check this article by Burgin and Meissner: Negative Probabilities in Financial Modeling (Wilmott Magazine March 2012). I think you should migrate your question to Quant SE. 

A variable is block exogenous, if it does not Granger cause ANY other variables of the VAR model. In your case, the direction of the Granger causality is the following: $DRS \rightarrow DLRGDP$ $DRS \rightarrow DLRM2$ $DLRGDP \rightarrow DRS$ $DLRM2 \rightarrow DRS$ As you can see, every variable Granger cause at least one other variable. There's no block exogeneity in your VAR model. 

This phenomenon leads to overheating spiral: higher profits cause higher costs, and higher costs cause higher profits. The government must set higher treasury rates to kill off the inflation monster. Sub-question. Increasing the money supply leads to the reverse effect of the former. Higher money supply increases the nominal rates, which give birth to crowding-out effect, so the aggregate output diminishes. As a result of lack of demand, the prices of production factor sink, which decrease the level of costs. 

Absolutely, these people have got different preferences. Here're the utility functions of residents ($r$) and immigrants (i): $$u_r=C-\alpha_r L$$ $$u_i=C-\alpha_i L$$ where C and L denotes consumption and work. We can conclude that $\alpha_r$ must be higher than $\alpha_i$. The disutility of work is higher in the case of the residents. 

You can include government consumption in the utility function of the representative consumer, but why? When we add exogenous government purchase shocks to a macro model, we enquire about the dynamics of the agent's consumption and labour supply change. This concept is clear and easy to measure. Let's assume that you are including government spending in an additively separable utility function. For example, the representative consumer is happy because of the government is investing in coastal defences. But he is unhappy about the state's Olympic games project. It's all OK, but how are you going to defend these assumptions empirically speaking? I think you should introduce a few agents plus. How do you describe the preferences of agents about the different government spending projects (defence forces, park building, etc.)? It's a normative assumption, what makes this research Economics no more. This research becomes Political Science. Unless you find or do a reliable research on the preference of agents about government spending projects. But keeping in mind, political preferences are very far-fetched from the so-called rationality. There is always an emotional factor, which makes a spending project likeable or not. How to make these "soft" questions into "hard" science? It's a very hard question. Anyway, what is the purpose of including include government consumption in the utility function? I can imagine an OLG model with a social choice problem. E.g. children want playground, adults park, and elders hospital. To answer your sub-question, government purchase is wasteful by default in Macroeconomics, unless this purchase don't effect the production function in a positively. In any other case, the welfare of the economy can be suboptimal. If government buys tablets for every pupils in schools, it may makes the workforce more productive in the long run. You can measure the effectiveness of government spending considering the fiscal multipliers indicator. It's a stylized fact that the effectiveness of government spending depends on the countries structural features (income, openness, exchange rate regime, etc.). See also: Enrique G. Mendoza, Carlos A. Vegh , Ethan Ilzetzki - How big are fiscal multipliers? New evidence from new data (01 October 2009) 

As you mentioned before, $\bar{n}$ is the sensitivity parameter of the interest rate to changes in short run output in a monetary policy rule. What is the relationship of $\bar{m}$ and $\bar{n}$ within the Taylor rule? It heavily depends on the given economic climate. Assuming the basic Canonical New Keynesian DSGE Model the equations of our economy are the following: IS (investment/saving) curve: $$ y_t = E_t [y_{t+1}] - \theta r_t +u_t^{y} $$ AD (aggregate demand) curve: $$ \pi_t = \beta E_t [\pi_{t+1}] +\kappa y_t + u_t^{\pi}$$ Taylor rule: $$ r_t = m E_t [\pi_{t+1}] + n E_t [y_{t+1}] + u_t^{r} $$ If you estimate the Taylor rule empirically with some kind of economic techniques, there should be considered 4 scenarios (shocks) . 

A good estimation of the labor supply is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of labor and consumption. A typical form of labor supply then: $$L_t ^\eta = w_t C_t ^{\sigma}$$ where $L_t$: labor, $w_t$: real wage, $C_t$: consumption, and $\eta, \sigma$: elasticities of labor and consumption. According to utilitarian school, working is considered a negative, and consumption is considered a desirable good. The goal is to optimize the path of lifetime consumption. 

Globally, labor-productivity growth in construction has averaged only 1 percent a year over the past two decades, compared with growth of 2.8 percent for the total world economy and 3.6 percent in the case of manufacturing (McKinsey, 2017). The most common market failures / problems in the construction industry are: 

Maybe the second case is a bit stupid, but I gave you a hint. Do you know any articles on the signalling theory / game theory / asymmetric information of the firms' recruiting process? Thank you in advance. 

We assume that the logarithmic function of $p_i$ equals the coefficients of the demand equation $w_i$. I have the following demand system: $$ w_{a}=-0.03-0.01 \ \ nk +0.02 \ lcons $$ $$ w_{b}=-0.26-0.004 \ nk +0.08 \ lcons $$ $$ w_{c}= \ \ \ 0.96+0.03 \ \ nk -0.14 \ lcons $$ $$ w_{d}= \ \ \ 0.30+0.001 \ nk -0.05 \ lcons $$ $$ w_{e}= \ \ \ 0.07-0.005 \ nk +0.04 \ lcons $$ $$ w_{f}=-0.05-0.01 \ \ nk +0.04 \ lcons $$ Variable $w_i$ denotes the proportion of good $i$ of the total consumption (cons) of a family, and $nk$ (number of kids) is a dummy variable. $lcons$ is the logarithm of the total consumption. Plus, I know the income of the families. I will appreciate your help with this situation. 

The quote implies that firms should calculate their costs using real wages instead of NOMINAL wages. Nominal wages are only important in the short run, nominal values are neutral in the long run. Repricing constantly leads to the well-known menu costs or shoe leather costs problems. 

After the Financial crisis of 2007–2008, the inflation's decay became more persistent in many countries. There are several reasons why: 

I would like to give advice whether a firm should entry the market or not. Is is it possible to decode price data like "the incumbent firms must have been playing a Bertrand's price competition game at the carp market"? Or do I need further details to say anything about the market structure? Is it possible to apply IO theory if I have only price data of an industry? I really need some clues, please. 

The main conclusion of Keynes' model is that GDP and real wages are countercyclical. Later, it was turned out to be moderately procyclical by empirical research. Other more sophisticated models: - sticky prices, flexible wages, perfect labour market - sticky prices, flexible wages, imperfect labour market - flexible prices, sticky wages, imperfect labour market If you want to model nominal effect, you should take note of nominal wages. If you are modelling fiscal shocks without the effect of the money, then considering real wages are maybe enough. It depends on one's research philosophy. 

The Phillips Curve equation is: $$\pi_t=\pi_t^e + \beta_1 (\beta_2 Y_t + (1-\beta_2) Z_t) + \varepsilon_t^\pi$$ where $\pi_t$ is the inflation, $\pi_t^e$ is the expected inflation, $Y_t$ is the output level, $Z_t$ is the real exchange rate, and $\varepsilon_t^\pi$ is a stochastic shock. In a small open economy (semi-structural framework), the impulse response functions to a domestic demand shock are the following: 

After the crisis, the Phillips Curve became flatter. My question is, how can one interpret the change in the slope of the Phillips Curve after the crisis? 

Considering this is an Economics Stack Exchange site, I’m going to answer in the spectre of Financial Economics. These are the most foundational equations and ideas of Financial Economics to understand more complex applied or academic research. 1. Gross yield The gross yield is the yield on an investment before the deduction of taxes and expenses. $$1+R_{t+1}=\frac{P_{t+1}+D_{t+1}}{P_t}$$ $R_{t+1}$: net yield $P_{t+1}$: price of the financial asset $D_{t+1}$: dividend 2. Present Value Present value ($PV$) is the current worth of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return. $$PV=\frac{FV_n}{(1+R)^n}$$ $FV$: future value $R$: interest rate 3. Gordon’s growth model The Gordon growth model is used to determine the intrinsic value ($V_0$) of a stock based on a future series of dividends ($D_0$) that grow at a constant rate ($g$). $$V_0=D_0 \frac{1+g}{R-g}$$ $R$: interest rate 4. Bond pricing The price of a bond is the sum of the present values of all expected coupon payments plus the present value of the par value at maturity. $$P_{bond}= \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{\text{Interest}}{(1+r_{it})^2}+\frac{\text{Par Value}}{(1+r_{iT})^2}$$ 5. Duration A measure of the sensitivity of the price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. Given the relation between present value, future cash-flow and yield to maturity:$$PV=\frac{\sum CF_t}{(1+YTM)^t}$$ The second order Taylor polynomial is the following: $$dPV=\underbrace{ \left( \frac{dPV}{dYTM} \right)dYTM}_{\textbf{Duration}}+ \underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{d^2 PV}{dYTM^2} \right)dYTM^2}_{\text{Convexity}}$$ $YTM$: yield to maturity 6. Convexity For any given bond, a graph of the relationship between price and yield is convex. This means that the graph forms a curve rather than a straight-line (linear). The degree to which the graph is curved shows how much a bond's yield changes in response to a change in price. $$dPV=\underbrace{ \left( \frac{dPV}{dYTM} \right)dYTM}_{\text{Duration}}+ \underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \frac{d^2 PV}{dYTM^2} \right)dYTM^2}_{\textbf{Convexity}}$$ 7. Liquidity premium A premium that investors will demand when any given security cannot be easily converted into cash, and converted at the fair market value. 8. CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) A model that describes the relationship between risk and expected return and that is used in the pricing of risky securities. It can be estimated by simple OLS: $$ER_i=R_f + \beta_i(ER_m-R_f)$$ $ER_i$: expected return of portfolio $i$, $ER_m$: expected return of the market portfolio, $R_f$: risk-free portfolio, $\beta_i$:CAPM-beta of portfolio $i$
