The important thing to get across to people is that as an intern you are already costing them a lot of money, so the extra cost of a little training could be small compared to value they gain in the short term from you having had that training. Using your example, if providing you with Methyl Salicylate handling training would mean that you could take the load off a permanent employee who is currently over-stretched, or allow someone else to provide even more business value than they are currently providing, you might be able to convince them to authorise the training. As with many things in business, you have to provide a business case for anything you want to spend company money on. You may not have all of the figures needed for a full cost-benefit analysis, but just having the discussion with your manager/mentor could be all that is needed to find other areas where a business case could be argued. 

In the European Union, you have to be careful that employees do not end up working longer hours than is allowed by the European Working Time Directive. Except in the UK (where you can agree to waive, in writing, your rights under the WTD) member states must ensure weekly working time is limited by law, or collective agreement and average working time should not exceed 48 hours for each 7 day period during the reference period of 4 months. Incidentally, in order to comply with this directive, employers in Europe are effectively forced to keep track of employee working hours. In the UK, I have known business to request that employees opt out of the WTD not so they can work longer hours, but to remove the requirement for hours to be tracked, reducing the administrative burden on both the employee and the company. 

I've recently been thinking about bias in recruitment procedures, as part of a consultation at work to help with our Athena Swan application. For early stage candidates, you may be able to significantly reduce your own bias in selecting candidates for interview by asking for resumes to be stripped of the following information before they reach your desk: 

Work out your market rate (I think Stack Overflow as a tool for this) Work out your monthly (or annual deficit), your market rate - your salary Book a meeting with your Father and the Co-owner to discuss this. You'll have to be firm but friendly. Frame it as 'by working for the family company I am effectively investing X monthly into the business, what can I get for this'. The owners need to look out for their long-term future but so do you. Shares or share options seem a viable option. 

People have answered about why the accepted wisdom is good, and they are valid points but you also asked 

If you are lucky enough to not to have to worry financially and you are fairly confident that you can freelance if need be, I think taking some time off for a break is a great idea. Why? 1. R&R Job searches can be hard work, especially if you have a demanding job. Taking some time to yourself can be great for you, it can give you some time to decompress and evaluate what you want to do next. 2. Travel Related to R&R but there are some trips that can't be easily done while working where you get a limited amount of holiday time. Long trips and experiencing other cultures can also be great for you personally, giving you a fresh perspective on your life. 3. Training There may be some skills that you would like to learn or brush up on, this can be hard when you are working full time. You can spend time on a formal or informal course to give you a chance to learn things that will be advantageous when looking for a new job. 4. Community work This could be open source work, or something local where your experience can be useful. Again this is a good thing to talk about when interviewing and can be good to give you insight into yourself. 5. Flexibility You kind of mentioned this, but it is worth reiterating when you start to look for work you can be flexible about when and where you interview and you can also be more flexible about start dates and locations, which will not hurt your prospects. 6. Networking You don't specify your field, but you may find there are events you can go to, conferences or such like, where you can network, talk about jobs and get to know more people in your field. If your current employers won't give you time for this you will be able to go on your own time (and cost). This can be a great springboard to freelancing or to another permanent position. 7. Assertiveness When you are interviewing you will be able to use points 2-6 above to show that you are a confident go-getting individual who is not afraid to step out of the norm to improve themselves. This is in many cases seen as a good thing and can reflect well on your prospects. So, of course, there are risks involved in jumping ship without a plan, and these should be seriously considered. But it is far from all downside, used correctly it can also benefit you greatly. 

No, it is not acceptable to use pirated software to do your job, in fact it could lose you your job. In the UK, the use of pirated software would usually be considered gross misconduct and be grounds for summary dismissal, so as risks go, that's a pretty big one. As others have mentioned, the reason companies treat this so seriously is because the consequences for the company can be grave. In the UK, The Federation Against Software Theft (FAST) publicises the legal penalties and security risks for piracy and prosecutes both organisations and individuals on behalf of its members. They also promote the use of Software Asset Management to help companies avoid copyright infringement. Even using software provided by your company, if you know it to be pirated, could result in pretty dire consequences - it's not impossible that you could be considered to be a conspirator and personally liable. Under such circumstances, ethically you should report the infringement to FAST (in the UK) and any repercussions for this should be covered by whistleblower legislation. The situation in the US, or in any of the countries around the world whose legal system is based on the UK/UK models, would be pretty much the same. The specific laws, crimes and enforcement agencies would be different, but the essential principal and the ethics of the situation would be identical. 

The best way to transfer knowledge is for the people who need the knowledge to work with those who have the knowledge. Whilst the knowledgeable people may not have the time to work on documenting their knowledge themselves, they may already be spending some of their time explaining to others what to do and how to do it. Even if the knowledgeable people had the time to write up their knowledge, it is not necessarily the case that the documentation they produced would be of use to the less knowledgeable people. It is surprisingly easy to miss out important 'obvious' information when trying to impart knowledge. By making the knowledge transfer more explicit and co-operative, and having the users of that documentation write it so that they can understand it, you could both ease the burden on the knowledgeable people and get more information transferred. If the knowledgeable people are really pressed for time, you could ask the people who need that knowledge to write up what they understand now, and then have the knowledgeable people proof-read and correct any misunderstandings. This could substantially speed things up, and could also help identify areas where the knowledge is lacking. 

If you've been with the company for less than 2 years, bring up the layoff rumors. The risk attached to looking jittery is less than the risk attached to being labeled a job-jumper. If you're a young employee, nobody can fault you for getting jittery, especially given this economy. If more than 2 years, go with the "looking for a career opportunity" route. This makes you look like a lifelong learning-go-getter, while at the same time nullifying points they'll dock you for abandoning ship when the cards are down. Companies and organizations want you to loyally stand by them when the chips are down, but any one of them will cut your job in a heartbeat if they feel that they need to. It's important to note, though, that given whatever your circumstances are, none of the five I've listed (or insert your own) are untruthful, per se. 

I feel kind of insensitive for asking about this. I am connected to a guy that suddenly died about a month ago of natural causes. I was just looking through my connections on LinkedIn, and apparently his family never deleted his account or whatever happens to a LinkedIn account when somebody dies. I am the sort that wants to keep his network "up-to-date" and "organized," but I don't want to be insensitive to his family should they be checking his forwarded email. I don't think this guy had much family (divorced with son) and I think his son would control his digital legacy. Unfortunately, his son is only about 10 years old, which doesn't mean that he is going to be taking care of these items for a long while. So, I have 3 questions: 

Here's a script to follow: inquest: Hey Susie, whatcha workin' on? Susie: Oh, we're having problems with the widget again! inquest: Is it a problem with the widget's manifold? Susie (suddenly attentive): Yes! You've worked with a widget's manifold? See how this works? This is much better than: inquest: Hey Susie, didn't you know I was a world-class level 4 black-belt widget manifold specialist from 1984-1986? Step aside! I can solve all your problems! In the former, your a helpful colleague concerned for Susie's plight. In the latter, you are self-seeking and egotistical. 

There is another possibility: That while the team were happy hiring you their decision was overruled. Often hiring decisions stay within the local team before getting a final sign off from higher up. It does seem to fit the evidence. It was not just yourself that spent a lot of time, the company did as well. They would not do this if they were not seriously interested. It sounds like it was the final authorisation that caused the issue. I've seen it from the other side, where I have interviewed a good candidate for a role where there was supposed to be a job and to be told that it was not possible to hire them. It is unlikely that the company would let on if this was the case, to say 'we have no budget', or 'we have a hiring freeze' or 'the sales team blew the budget on their team building trip to Venice' is not something they would say to somebody in your position. While it is disappointing it does happen. 

Firstly take a little stock of the situation. If the market rate for you is 25% more than you are getting, it is likely that to replace you your current employer would have to offer that. (Unless you are being underutilized, in which case moving may be better for you). However on the flip side some companies can't pay more, either due to financial or bureaucratic reasons. Be prepared to move if they can't make the offer you want. Also 25% is quite a chunk of money, but be careful of the work you will be doing, career progression, benefits and hours expected. Hopefully you have thought of this and you are prepared to leave if you are not successful in your negotiation. Right, so as others have said you don't need to put request for a counter offer in your letter. It is just a formal notice. However it can be an effective tool if you wish to play hard ball, and take a little risk. A resignation letter is a deadly serious way to show that you are serous. Write it print it out, put it in your pocket. Tell whoever it able to negotiate your salary that you need to talk to them. OK so very clearly explain your situation in the meeting. Don't make it personal. Just be clear is that as much as you like the job, you can't turn down an offer like you are getting unless you get X. Some people do this without having an offer to back it up. I have seen companies where threatening to quit was the only way to get a decent pay rise. Your boss may think you are doing this. This is where the letter comes in handy, if they are not willing to negotiate you can hand it in there and then. Make clear that this is the case. In my experience actually having the letter will help you negotiate, even if it just the fact that it alters your frame of mind. Be very careful to make clear that this is just about you getting paid the going rate, not a personal vendetta or blackmail. The risk is that after you resign your other offer could evaporate. Unlikely but it can happen. Most of all don't feel bad. Companies will get away with paying as little as they can get away with. If you can get a chunk more money elsewhere they are under paying you. 

The "Fair Wage Effort Hypothesis" is a well-known idea in the world of economics. Nobel prize winner George Akerlof and Janet Yellen wrote several papers discussing the effects of open knowledge of salaries across an enterprise. For the lazy, I will summarize: people that know your salary compare it to their own. If they feel that they are not being appropriately compensated in comparison to a colleague, they will adjust their efforts in the workplace to match their compensation level. For the record, I am not so sure that that effort alone is adjusted; I think that people generally prefer to leave, but this hints at another cost for the business. Sure, you might make a stream of income by not paying somebody what they are worth, but it must be compared against the costs of bringing somebody new on board, the cost of lost time on projects, etc. On the other hand, people almost always overestimate what their own worth is to the company. 

Just one short thing to add: make sure that you get the interpretation of the events correct. I had colleague mad at me for 6 months once because he thought I made a fat joke (which is something I never would do). If there's any room for doubt, hold your boss in goodwill, and shake it off. This ensures that work relationships are not damaged. If he's the type that gets off on people feeling bad about themselves (and there ARE plenty of bosses like that in the world), then the only way to feed the beast is to feel bad about yourself. 

You should never make a decision about whether or not to stay in a job based on whether somebody has spent money on hiring you. In my opinion, the cost of the burnt bridges plus the "enemies" is a price worth paying for a meaningful career move.
