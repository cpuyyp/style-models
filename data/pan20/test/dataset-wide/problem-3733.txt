Let $X$ be a non-singular, projective variety and $Y \subset X$ non-singular, projective subvariety. Denote by $\pi:W \to X$ the blow-up of $X$ along $Y$. Let $Y_1 \subset W$ be a non-singular subvariety of codimension $1$ such that the restriction $\pi:Y_1 \to \pi(Y_1)$ is an isomorphism. We assume that $Y_1$ intersects properly the exceptional divisor of $W$. Denote by $j_1:Y_1 \hookrightarrow W$ and $j_2:\pi(Y_1) \hookrightarrow X$. Is it then true that, $j_{1_*}:H^2(Y_1) \to H^4(W)$ is the same as $$H^2(Y_1) \cong H^2(\pi(Y_1)) \xrightarrow{j_{2_*}} H^4(X) \xrightarrow{\pi^*} H^4(W)?$$ 

Let $X$ be a smooth, rationally connected variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Denote by $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ the space of automorphisms of $X$ and for a given $\phi \in \mathrm{Aut}(X)$, denote by $\mathrm{Fix}(\phi)$ the fixed points of the automorphism $\phi$. I wanted to ask, if there is any known condition under which the intersection $F$ of all $\mathrm{Fix}(\phi)$ as $\phi$ ranges over all elements of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ is the emptyset? 

Let $\pi:X \to B$ be a family of smooth, projective curves. Fix coprime integers $r,d$. Denote by $\mathcal{M}(r,d)$ the relative moduli functor corresponding to rank $r$, degree $d$, semi-stable sheaves on $X$ flat over $B$. It seems from the book "Relative moduli spaces of semi-stable sheaves on families of curves" by Jens Thomas Alexander Lang, Theorem 6.10, this functor is representable. But, this book is not downloadable and I cannot see the entire proof. Is this statement true (i.e., is $\mathcal{M}(r,d)$ representable if $r$ and $d$ are coprime)? If so, can anyone tell me if this book is available online or suggest an alternate reference. A sketch of the proof is also fine. 

Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring and $X$ be a regular, integral. projective $R$-scheme, flat over $R$. Let $F$ be a torsion-free coherent sheaf on $X$ of rank $n$, flat over $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. Is there any known additional conditions on $X$ under which we can conclude that the exterior power $\wedge^n F$ is again flat over $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$? 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>0$ and $f:X \to Y$ be a quasi-projective morphism between noetherian $k$-schemes. Assume that $Y$ is regular and the geometric generic fiber of $f$ is generically non-reduced. Does there exist a noetherian scheme $Z$ and a dominant morphism $Z \to Y$, locally of finite type such that: 1) $Z$ is reduced and $\dim Z=\dim Y$ 2) the geometric generic fiber of the composition $(Z \times_Y X)_{\mathrm{red}} \to Z \times_X Y \to Z$ is generically reduced. 

Let $R$ be a Henselian discrete valuation rings with algebraically closed residue field and $X$ be a regular, flat, proper $R$-scheme. Assume that the generic fiber to the natural morphism from $X$ to $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ is smooth and the singular fiber is simple normal crossings divisor. Is it true that $H^i(\mathcal{O}_X)$ is a torsion-free $R$-module for $i>0$ i.e., for $K=\mathrm{Frac}(R)$, is the natural morphism from $H^i(\mathcal{O}_X)$ to $H^i(\mathcal{O}_X) \otimes_R K$ injective for all $i>0$? If not true in general, is there any known condition on $X$, under which this could hold true? 

Let $f,g:A \to B$ be two ring homomorphisms of noetherian rings satisfying that for any prime ideal $\mathfrak{q} \subset B$, $f^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})=g^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})=:\mathfrak{p}$ and the induced morphisms from $A/\mathfrak{p} \to B/\mathfrak{q}$ are the same. Is it true that $f=g$? If not true in general, is there any known additional conditions on $A$ or $B$, for which we have a positive answer to the question? Any reference/hint will be most welcome. 

Let $G$ be a connected, linear, semi-simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and $P$ be the maximal parabolic subgroup. We know that the quotient $Z=G/P$ is a projective scheme. Is it true that the Picard group of $Z$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}$? 

Let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ be an affine integral scheme of finite type over $\mathbb{C}$ and $\phi:\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ be a surjective morphism of coherent sheaves on $X$. Let $f \in A$, $U:=D(f)$ the open set defined by $f$ and $s \in H^0(\mathcal{G})$. Let $s' \in \Gamma(U,\mathcal{F})$ be a section such that $\phi(s')=s|_U$. Does there exist an open set $V \subset X$ containing $\mathrm{Supp}(s)$ and a section $s_0 \in \Gamma(V,\mathcal{F})$ such that $\phi|_V(s_0)=s|_V$ and $s_0|_{V \cap U} =s'|_{V \cap U}$? 

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero and $X$ a smooth, projective $k$-variety. Let $E_{\overline{k}}$ be a coherent sheaf on $X_{\overline{k}}$ ($\overline{k}$ denotes the algebraic closure of $k$). Then, does there exist a finite extension $L$ of $k$ and a coherent sheaf $E_L$ on $X_L$ such that the pull-back of $E_L$ to $X_{\overline{k}}$ is isomorphic to $E_{\overline{k}}$? 

Let $R$ be a complete DVR with fraction field $K$, $X$ be a regular scheme flat over $R$. Let $L$ be a finite field extension of $K$ and $Q$ be the integral closure of $R$ in $L$. Denote by $Y:=X \times_R Q$ the base change of $X$. Is $Y$ a regular scheme? If not true in general, is there any additional assumption on $R$ for which this holds true? PS. One can assume that the characteristic of $K$ is zero. 

Let $X$ be a smooth, projective variety, $Y \subset X$ a smooth, projective subvariety of codimension $3$. Denote by $\pi:\tilde{X} \to X$ the blow-up of $X$ along $Y$ and by $E$ the exceptional divisor. We know, that $\pi|_E:E \to Y$ is a $\mathbb{P}^2$-bundle. Let $\pi':F \to Y$ be a $\mathbb{P}^1$-sub-bundle of $E$ in the sense that there exists a closed immersion $i:F \hookrightarrow E$ such that $\pi|_E \circ i=\pi'$. Is it possible to say something about the kernel of the push-forward morphism $i_*:\mathrm{Pic}(F) \to A^2(E)$ i.e., about its generators, where $A^2(E)$ denotes the Chow group of codiension $2$ cycles on $E$. If necessary assume that $\mathrm{Pic}(Y)=\mathbb{Z}$. I know that this is not the Gysin map on Chow groups. The question is motivated by Gysin map on cohomology, rather its restriction to certain Hodge structures. To simplify the original question, I have given the above formulation. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and $X$ be a smooth projective curve over $k$ of genus $g \ge 2$. Fix a polarization $L$ on $X$. Does there exist a semi-stable vector bundle on $X$ of rank $r$ and degree $d$ with gcd$(r,d)=1$? I know that this result is true in characteristic zero. I have heard this to be true in positive characteristic but have not been able to find a good reference for this fact or a counterexample. Any reference/hint would be very helpful. EDIT Assume further that $k$ is countable. 

Let $p:=[0,0,...,0,1] \in \mathbb{P}^n$ the point whose all the coordinates are zero except for the $n$-th. This defines a linear projection map $\phi:\mathbb{P}^n-p \to \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$, given by $[x_0,...,x_n] \mapsto [x_0,...,x_{n-1}]$. Let $X$ be a local complete intersection subscheme in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. Is it true that the scheme theoretic closure of $\phi^{-1}(X)$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is a local complete intersection subscheme in $\mathbb{P}^n$? If not, is there any known condition on $X$ under which we have an affirmitive answer to the question? (Assume the underlying field is the field of complex numbers and $n \ge 3$) EDIT: If I understand correctly, $\overline{\phi^{-1}(X)}$ is locally complete intersection at all points in $\phi^{-1}(X)$. It only remains to prove it is locally complete intersection at $p$ (if $p \in \overline{\phi^{-1}(X)}$). Since $p$ is of codimension at least $2$ Hartshorne's Ex. III.$3.5$ tells us that the ideal sheaf of $\overline{\phi^{-1}(X)}$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ is simply the pushforward of the ideal sheaf of $\phi^{-1}(X)$ in $\mathbb{P}^n\backslash p$ under the open immersion $i:\mathbb{P}^n\backslash p \to \mathbb{P}^n$. Finally, we just need to show that the stalk at $p$ of the ideal sheaf of $\overline{\phi^{-1}(X)}$ is generated by a regular sequence. The question is then, when is this possible? 

Let $X$ be a projective variety with at worst (analytic) normal crossings singularities and $\pi:\tilde{X} \to X$ be the normalisation. Is there a "nice" description relating the picard group of $X$ and $\tilde{X}$, for example through a short exact sequence. We know that, in the case $X$ is a curve we have such a short exact sequence. Any idea/reference will be most helpful. 

Let $X$ be an irreducible nodal curve (over $\mathbb{C}$) with exactly one node, say at $x$. Let $F$ be a torsion-free, rank $n$ sheaf on $X$. We know that $F_x \cong \mathcal{O}_{X,x}^{\oplus n-a} \oplus m_x^{\oplus a}$ for some integer $a$, where $m_x$ is the maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$. Using Chapter II. Lemma $2.3$ of Special divisors and vector bundles by S. Narasimhan, we know that if the normalisation of $X$ is rational, then there exists a rank $n$ locally free sheaf $E$ on $X$ containing $F$ such that $E/F$ is supported at $x$ and is isomorphic to $k(x)^{\oplus a}$. This result has been cited in $(2.7)$ of Torsion-free sheaves on nodal curves and triples by H. Lange and others. However, the curve in this case need not normalise to a rational curve. My question is: Does the proof of Lemma II$.2.3$ in the paper of Narasimahan, generalise to torsion-free sheaves on any nodal curve with exactly one node? Is there a reference for this more general result? 

Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring, $\{B_i\}_{i\in I}$ be an inductive system of $R$-algebras of finite type and $B$ the direct limit of the inductive system. Let $X$ be a regular, projective scheme, flat over $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. Fix a polarization $H$ on $X$, under which there is a closed immersion $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_R$ for some integer $n$. Denote by $H_i$ the pull-back of $H$ under the natural morphism $X \times_R \mathrm{Spec}(B_i) \to X$. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $X \times_R \mathrm{Spec}(B)$ and $\{\mathcal{F}_i\}_{i \in I}$ be a sequence of coherent sheaves on $X \times_R \mathrm{Spec}(B_i)$ for $i \in I$ satisfying: 1) For each $i \in I$, $\mathcal{F}_i$ is semi-stable under the polarization $H_i$ 2) The pullback of $\mathcal{F}_i$ under the natural morphism $X \times_R \mathrm{Spec}(B) \to X \times_R \mathrm{Spec}(B_i)$, arising from the natural morphism $B_i \to B$, is isomorphic to $\mathcal{F}$. The question is: Is $\mathcal{F}$ semi-stable under the polarization $H$? 

Let $\pi:\mathcal{C} \to B$ be a (flat) family of complex projective schemes of pure dimension $1$ with fixed Hilbert polynomial, in particular, for some $n \ge 3$, $\mathcal{C} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_B$, the composition of this closed immersion with the natural projection $\mathbb{P}^n_B \to B$ is $\pi$ and there exists a Hilbert polynomial $P$ such that for all $b \in B$, the fiber $\pi^{-1}(b)$ is of Hilbert polynomial $P$ in $\mathbb{P}^n_b$. Assume that $B$ is integral. Suppose that there exists a closed point $b_0 \in B$ such that the fiber $\pi^{-1}(b_0)$ can be embedded into $\mathbb{P}^3$ i.e., the closed immersion of $\pi^{-1}(b_0) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ factors through $\mathbb{P}^3$. Is it then possible to find an open neighbourhood $U$ of $b_0$ such that for all $u \in U$, $\pi^{-1}(u)$ can be embedded into $\mathbb{P}^3_u$ i.e., the closed immersion of $\pi^{-1}(u) \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_u$ factors through $\mathbb{P}^3_u$? If not, is there any known condition on $B$ under which this happens? EDIT By "closed immersion $i:A \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ factors through $\mathbb{P}^3$", I mean that there is a closed immersion $i_1:A \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^3$ and a LINEAR embedding $i_2:\mathbb{P}^3 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ such that $i=i_2 \circ i_1$. 

We know that for an effective divisor on a smooth projective variety there is a natural way of associating to it a scheme, in particular using the Cartier divisor. Can we do the same for higher codimension effective algebraic cycles? More precisely, let $X$ be a smooth projective variety and $Z_c:=\sum_i a_iZ_i$ be an algebraic cycle on $X$, where $Z_i$ are integral of the same codimension and $a_i>0$. Then, 1) Is there a natural way of associating to $Z_c$ a scheme $Z$ such that the corresponding segre class $s(Z,X)$ (notation as in Fulton's Intersection theory, chapter $4$) is the cycle $Z_c$? 2) Furthermore, if $Z_{c_{\mathrm{red}}}=\sum_i Z_i$ is local complete intersection subscheme in $X$, then can we find such a $Z$ which is also local complete intersection subscheme in $X$? 

Let $\pi:\mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be a flat, projective family of noetherian schemes with generic fiber a smooth, projective variety. Let $p:\mathcal{Y} \to \mathcal{X}$ be another flat, projective family such that the composed morphism $\pi \circ p:\mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{P}^1$ satisfies the property that for a general $t \in \mathbb{P}^1$, $\mathcal{Y}_t:=(\pi \circ p)^{-1}(t)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^2_{\mathcal{X}_t}$, where $\mathcal{X}_t:=\pi^{-1}(t)$. Does this imply that for any point $t \in \mathbb{P}^1$,$\mathcal{Y}_t \cong \mathbb{P}^2_{\mathcal{X}_t}$? If not true in general, is there any known condition under which this holds? Any idea/reference in this direction will be very helpful. 

Let $X$ be a projective reduced (not necessarily irreducible) curve over an algebraically closed field and $\mathcal{F}$ be a pure coherent sheaf on $X$. Is it true that $\mathcal{F}$ is Gieseker semistable if and only if it is slope semistable? If so, does the same conclusion holds if $X$ is of higher dimension?
