I don't have your lean factor but from the info you provided i would say that your calorie intake should be at least 2000 calories a day not less. Don't rush into anything as it will do you more harm then good, try to find someone who has done these programs and get more insight as to if the intensity level it will suit you. 

An interesting solution for you might be to the following workout every 2nd day for 2 weeks. Warm Up. Do some dynamic stretches. Then only on your right side do a static glute stretch, this is so that you weaken the muscle on the right side a little, but please take extreme care not to over stretch as that can cause injury during the workout. Now do a single leg squat on your right leg without any weights and on your left leg add 5LB in each hand and do the same. You can incorporate this in any workout you are doing if you feel it will help. Another option to look at is to do yoga, I have seen a lot of results in that area on myself with yoga. 

I really like the question as its something that a lot of teenagers struggle with at this age. To your question "Will increasing the number of reps I can do back to back help with muscle gain, or will this gain plateau eventually?" the answer is Yes you will gain a drop of muscle but not alot, and Yes doing the same thing all the time will cause you to gain a plateau. Having said that I think you need to look at other options ifd you are serious about getting in better shape, the best option for you would be is to look to get a program, and I will list 2. 

Increase in height is not an issue if you really like your body and accept it. Although in some cases like sports/ work(armed forces) requires you to have a min height which is different based on their rules and regulations to which you cannot avoid it. Normally the height of the body grows during the period of 13-19 years of age approx.(Depending on the gender Male or Female) During this age period if the body get's the required supplements as well as the exercise then the body starts to grow in height. Sometimes even if your hereditary genes lack growth by proper excise in this time you can even overcome the height limit which was not seen in your previous generations.( i.e. you tend to be taller then your old generations) However the height of the person is also limited based on the region which they were born.(not meant to be racial but like for region's In the eastern side of the world it's just the kind of proteins or the supplements which is abundant in the area through food and water which your body absorbs correct me if I am wrong ). You might increase the height of the body up to the age of 22 or 24 max only if it's a matter of few inches like in 5Ft 4inch can be increased to 5Ft 7inch or even 5Ft 8 inch.Although that's not a huge difference but still in the end you have gained / improved your height which matter's the most for you. Just follow the above exercises properly and maintain an healthy diet for your bones and your body as well. 

Since having children, I have taken up running because I can push them along. Sometimes I push one kid in a running stroller, other times I push two kids in a small-wheeled stroller that offers much more resistance. I have been reading and developing the ChiRunning technique, which provides fairly detailed instructions about movement. How can I adapt my running technique (ChiRunning specifically, or running technique in general) to accommodate pushing a stroller? Some specific problems / questions that I am 'running' into: 

I have a proposed mechanism from personal experience. Although there is insufficient evidence, I hope that the information will be an anectdote to the above statments that more or less imply that there may be no negative side effects of riding with these shoes. Please comment if you have had any similar experiences. Riding and racing bicycles was my primary extracurricular activity for many years - all done with cycling shoes. Now I ride my bike for commuting - with the same look style cleats and often with heavy loads of children and a single gear. I have taken up running for my primary activity. After developing plantar fascitis last summer, and then feeling the way my foot naturally attempts to grab the pedal by curling up, I am beginning to suspect that this could cause some of the issues with my plantar tendon. I am generally very cautious about and attentive to errors that may be leading to pain. So, I am planning to get either flatter pedals or using cycling shoes. 

I agree that different exercise suits for different body types. Different diet ,proteins etc. are good for one body type and may not be good for the other. But how can one identify their build or type of body. According to me the first step in Body building or having a healthy body is identifying your body type. After identifying one's body only can one have the desired progress in the stipulated or expected time(as one can clearly follow his/her given exercises ) and then maintain a strict diet for his/her particular body.(could be fat, lean, athletic etc.). Also please clarify how and based on what is the body classified. 

I basically do 20-25 dips which is slightly inclined towards the wall and then some push ups of 20-25 for starting. The height is 5Ft 11 and weight 69.1kgs Male for which i am underweight. My question is what kind of muscle is being targeted when doing the inclined dip and the push ups.My goal is to remove fatigue and weight gain. Is it the appropriate kind of exercise that i do or i need to bring in some changes.Willing to give commitment for it.Images or links would be helpful for correct technique Time and space are my constraints please suggest accordingly. 

Instead of the cereals loaded with chocolate you could opt for the Cornflakes kind of breakfast and top it with fruits which you like the most(do not mix sugar again in the milk). Go for muesli if fresh fruits are not available but make sure the muesli contain the fruit but not the added flavour and very less sugar content. This will definitely wean you off your cereal habit and also give your body the required energy for the day plus the taste of the fruits. Follow this breakfast regime for atleast 2-3 weeks and you will see the result for your self.
