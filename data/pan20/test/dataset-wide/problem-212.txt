Making things that are small enough to fit inside a building. That would include making swords and knives, pottery and dishes, clothes, shoes, furniture, saddles, jewelry, etc. Repairing any of the above. Cutting hair and other such personal grooming services. Paperwork. Copying books, keeping accounts, record-keeping in general. Painting and sculpture. Performing music. Preparing and/or serving food and drink. Doctoring and nursing. Government, in the sense of debating and passing laws or handing out decrees, handing out licenses or permits or letters of marquee and the like, collecting taxes, etc. 

Lots of answers here already but I'll throw in my two cents. Maybe their technology has just gone in different directions from ours. We tend to think of all technology as being on the same scale. It's easy to imagine a society that is more primitive than ours -- just look at our own past. It's easy to imagine a society more advanced. But we tend to think of all sorts of different branches of technology on the same timeline. Like, nuclear power is a mid-20th century technology, and television is a mid-20th century technology. So we think that a society that has television would also have nuclear power and vice versa. But who says? Perhaps people on another planet would be far ahead of us in one area, but far behind in another. Perhaps their electronics is very advanced so they have artifical intelligence and android robots, but their medicene is way behind so they have no concept of organ transplants and no drugs beyond herbs that people find in nature. Maybe they use advanced robots to put leaches on patients (or whatever the equivalent is in their biology). This would be problematic in some ways. Technologies depend on each other, sometimes in ways that aren't obvious unless you know the whole history. Like, early computers were in many ways based on tabulating machines, machines that would read punch cards and calculate totals. Those tabulating machines were based on principles developed for looms, to make cloth with patterns in it (jacquard looms). If our society had never seen a need for cloth with pretty patterns rather than plain solid colors, we might never have invented computers. Or at least, they would have had to have a different history. The idea that a society could invent electrical and electronic devices, but never invent internal combustion engines, doesn't seem all that far out. You could explain it based on available resources. Maybe the materials to make computers are plentiful on this world but petroleum is rare to non-existant. You could explain it based on need. Like the old aphorism, "Necessity is the mother of invention." Perhaps the people on this world never perceived a need to travel very fast or very far. Like the population is small and everyone lives close together, and the people aren't all that curious about exploring the rest of the world, so the few people who travel and explore just don't create enough demand for advanced transportation technology. 

Hitting a planet behind your target is a non-issue, unless your slugs are VERY big or have a LOT of momentum. It will just burn up in the atmosphere. Well, you did say a "few percent of the speed of light", that is a lot of momentum. Easy enough to make up numbers for mass and exact speed and calculate kinetic energy, but I don't know how to get from there to calculating what happens when it hits the atmosphere. Maybe Tunguska was a stray slug from an alien space battle. :-) If your battle is in deep space, probably a non issue. Space is very big. The probability that someone will run into this slug in all the hundreds of cubic light years between any two stars is minuscule. Where it could be an issue is if your battle is in a planetary orbit, and both sides are firing lots of slugs. Now you're adding a lot of space debris. But then if you're firing at a few percent of the speed of light, it's not going to stay in orbit, it's going to go flying off into deep space. Let's see, it takes light approximately 5 hours to travel from the Sun to Pluto. So at 1% of the speed of light, that would take 500 hours or about 3 weeks. So in three weeks, your slug has exited the Solar System and is in deep space. Back to non-issue. 

How barren is the desert? And how high-tech are the people? People manage to live in deserts on Earth. The Sahara is probably the most desolate place on Earth, yet people live there and some even built cities there. If there's any water at all, and any nutrients in the soil, than it should be possible to eke out some kind of living. BTW a truly barren desert with an Earth-like atmosphere is problematic. Earth's atmosphere is sustained by complex interactions, of which the most basic is that animals generally take in oxygen and give off carbon dioxide while plants do the reverse. If a planet has no plant life, what is producing the oxygen? I suppose with sufficient imagination you could come up with some mechanism, of course. 

Just going by the title of your question, the answer would be, "Just how strong and/or powerful are you assuming that this dragon is?" In the body of your question you give a bunch of details to answer that. These make your dragon pretty formidable. In a sense one could say that, as you say that the dragon is impervious to small arms fire, then it is invincible unless someone can attack it with something more potent than small arms. I guess that would mean canons. Many possible means of attack come to mind: 

This is just a slightly special case of the general question, "How could we tell if an alien race is intelligent or convince an alien race that we are intelligent?" Adding the detail that they are giant ants and the human ship has made an emergency landing would likely change the details, but the big question is tough enough without getting into details. I'm sure thousands of science fiction stories have been written exploring this idea. For starters, what is the definition of "intelligent"? We often talk about using tools. But people have trained animals to use simple tools. I saw a documentary years ago about animals in nature using simple tools, like a bird trying to reach the water in a bottle with an opening too small for its head, dropping pebbles into the bottle until the water level rose to where it could drink it. Was that "intelligent"? Etc. While the aliens in most SF stories think and act just like people, the only difference being that they have blue skin or pointy ears, some writers have tried to craft a truly alien intelligence. (Aside from the dull standby "they have no emotions", which always leaves me wondering, Then why do they do anything at all? It's a paradox to say that they have no emotions because they are so proud of their refined logic. Isn't "pride" an emotion? If they don't love or hate anything, then that must mean they don't love life. So why would they lift a finger to protect themselves from a wild animal attack or a heavy object falling on them? Wouldn't they all be dead within a few months? Etc. But anyway ...) Could aliens have a totally different mathematics, for example? Could they never have thought of the idea that 2+2=4 but be very advanced in, say, Euclidean geometry? It seems theoretically possible but difficult to imagine how it would work in practice. Would aliens wear clothes, or is that something peculiar to humans? One could imagine aliens who do not get sexually excited at the sight of each others' bodies -- maybe who don't reproduce by sex at all -- and who have never thought of the idea of fashion, i.e. clothes for decoration, and so only wear clothes when necessary to protect them from extreme weather, etc. Aliens might communicate in a way imperceptible to us, like they might have radio transmitter and receivers built into their bodies. Or they might communicate in a way that we can perceive, but that would be too far from our thinking or too subtle for humans to notice. Like emitting odors in a specific pattern, blinking their eyes in Morse-like code, etc. I'm reminded of an SF story I read many years ago -- sorry, I forget the title and author -- but there's a scene where humans meet aliens, and eventually one of the humans figures out that the aliens communicate by sending microwave messages. At this point one of the other humans says, "You mean they communicate by telepathy?" And the first person says, "Sort of. But to them, so do we. They don't think of sound as a method of communication, so when we talk to each other" etc. Anyway, books can and have been written on this subject. I can't imagine you'll get a complete, definitive answer here. I'm just throwing a few thoughts in to chat, basically. 

I don't see a blatant problem with "country". Nothing in the word connotes a subset of a single planet to me. Even if it does mean that to you and others, words often are adapted to new situations. "Computer" used to be a job title for a PERSON who performed arithmetic calculations. When the mechanical devices came along, they were seen as replacing human computers and so were called by the same name. Today I doubt anyone uses the word "computer" to refer to a person. If and when we colonize other planets, it's hard to say what words people will use. My guess is that words for terrestial nations will just be carried over. If, say, India were to establish a colony on Mars, I suspect we would say that the "country of India now consists of the Asian sub-continent and their Mars colony". It's also possible that people will adapt some other word or invent a new word, but I don't know how we'd predict what word. Some terms would clearly be inapplicable. Like today we say "This is the area controlled by such-and-such nation". An interstellar nation wouldn't occupy an "area" but a "volume". I wonder if people in the future will casually refer to "the volume our nation controls" rather than "the area". Etc. 

It must be possible to come up with a set of bills totaling any desired amount. But that's easy: You have to have a 1. You should be able to make any likely amount with a manageable number of bills. For example, if all you had were 1's, and you had to pay 653, that would require counting out 653 bills. Or if you had just 1 and 100, 653 would still require 6 hundreds and 53 ones, still a pain to count. It should be easy to do the arithmetic to add up the total value of a stack of bills. If your denominations were 1, 6, 13, 28, and 87, it would be much easier to make arithmetic mistakes if trying to count in your head than if they were 1, 10, and 100. The number of different denominations shouldn't be too large, or it gets hard to manage them. Like in the US, cash registers generally have 5 bins, for \$1, \$5, \$10, \$20, and "bigger". If you had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 100, this would be a pain for anybody who has to sort money: the number of piles gets too large. 

It depends on how much you are assuming it is possible to observe at such a distance. If we observed alien life (intelligent or not), it could tell us a lot about what is biologically possible. Is the aliens chemistry also based on Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen? Do they have something like DNA? How is it the same and how different? Do they gain nutrition, reproduce, etc, similar to creatures on Earth or do they do these things differently? Etc. Conceivably such knowledge could lead to a greater understanding of our own biology, what is inevitable and what is coincidental. Thus it might lead to improvements in medicine, genetic engineering, agriculture, who knows? Or, of course, such knowledge might turn out to be of only academic interest with no practical implications. Depending on just what we learned. 

Yes, Google is big and provides a lot of services. But it's not like they're the only ones out there providing these services. If Google suddenly and mysteriously evaporated tomorrow, millions of people would be inconvienced for weeks. Then people would switch to other providers offering comparable services. I don't know of any service that is offerred ONLY by Google, but if there is something, and people care, someone would come along to offer a comparable service. Bing and other search engines would take up the slack on search engine business. There are hosts of email providers and DNS providers, losing Google would be a drop in the bucket. I don't know an existing alternative to the Google App Store, but if there isn't one, somebody would build one in a hurry. Etc. I'd guess that within 6 months or so there'd be little noticable remaining effect. People who had valuable data on Google servers that was lost would be harest hit. They might take considerable time to recover. I suppose some businesses that had critical data stored on Google and no backups anywhere else could be ruined. In real life it's hard to imagine Google simply disappearing over night. If they started losing money it would likely be months or years before they actually went bankrupt. Or whatever scenario you're supposing, people would likely have time to adapt, so when they finally did close up shop, it would be a minor disruption for the few who had failed to prepare. Their servers and software and buildings wouldn't just evaporate: other companies would buy them up. It's like when US Airways went bankrupt, their planes and pilots and so on didn't all disappear, they were absorbed by other airlines. People who had tickets were inconvenienced, but that's about as far as it went. It's not like it led to an end to all air travel. Big companies go out of business all the time. It's tough on the employees and investors, but the rest of the world goes on with little notice. 

Once they have radio, communication is clearly possible. You could send a message to another planet with pulsed lasers but that's a more complex technology than radio. But they could at least theoretically communicate well before that. They might, for example, build giant bonfires that would create enough light to be seen with telescopes from the other world. Once you have something that is detectable, you can vary it in one way or another to create meaningful messages. Like create a string of fires in some pattern that conveys a message. The big question is, how big a bonfire? I found a formula that says that the maximum resolution of a telescope, in radians, is R=w/D, where w is the wavelength of light and D is the diameter of the telescope. (I have no idea where this formula comes from or how to prove it.) If we assume visible light is about 600 nM and the telescope is 10 m, that gives R=60e-9. The smallest object we could then see would be x=sin(R)*s, where s is the distance between the planets. Let's say they're as far apart as Earth and Mars, around 60e9 km at closest approach. So sin(60e-9)*60e9 = 3600 m, or about 3 1/2 kilometers. You can distinguish light versus darkness much more easily than resolving an object in general, so I think a bonfire much smaller than this would be visible. Anybody know how to calculate that? I guess it's still at least hundreds of meters. So, big project, but doesn't seem impossible. Of course just sending a signal and actually working out a comprehensible message are two different things. That's another whole dimension. If aliens could send us a letter with printed text, could we figure it out? It's hard enough to decipher ancient languages, which are of course written by fellow humans. What would it take to decipher a message from aliens?
