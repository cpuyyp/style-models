In Propositionals Logic 'Some cats are black', since it is atomic, will be formalised like this: 'P'. In Predicate Logic 'Some cats are black' will be formalised like this: '∃x (Fx & Gx)', which should be read as 'There is at least one thing that is both a cat and black. 

What other questions are regarded as fundamental (nowadays*) by contemporary philosophers? *Since this particular question is new in the sense that neither philosphers in the antiquity nor middle-age philosophers addressed it. 

I think it looks like a good place to start with. Maybe not everything that passes is really good, but those not passing can be dismissed. The serial rapist probably fails on 2, 3 and 4. 

According to the philpapers survey, 78% of the participating philosophers said they accept or lean towards atheism. 14% accept or lean towards theism, and the rest went into 'Other' with 12.6%. You can find the survey here: $URL$ 

Humanity is not identical to the universe (universe is way bigger), although we are a part of it. So you can say: A little part of the universe is trying to discover the universe. 

Particular: a thing without properties. It has to instantiate universals(properties) in order to have a shape, a color, a taste etc. Individual: the red apple. It does not instantiate anything. In the ontology of someone believing in individuals (nominalists), there are no abstract things as properties, just individuals, and there are red individuals, blue individuals etc. The predicate just describes an individual, but does not denote an object. Trope: a trope is a particularized property. This apples redness for example. The tropes of this apple of course differ from the tropes of that apple. Universal: Redness, Shape, Length, Weight, whatever. Particulars instantiate these in order to ~have~ properties. 

And here you can read the Introduction (on Sider's Homepage), which includes short abstracts for each chapter. 

Your questions belongs to mereology, the (part philosophical, part mathematical) theory of part and whole. We should begin by distinguishing between parthood and proper parthood. Something is a proper part of some other thing iff the first is part of the second, and the two are not identical. Something is a part of something else iff the first thing is a proper part of the second, or both are identical. Let's call something that has no proper parts a simple, and everything that has proper parts a composite object. Then the view you ascribe to physics is the view that the fundamental objects are simple, while the others, you and me, chairs and tables, are composite. There are philosophers who think that everything is infinitely divisible (Anaxagoras would be an ancient example). This idea, or stuff that is infinitely divisible, is often called 'gunk'. For gunky objects it is true that every part again has a proper part. (Lewis introduced this term in his book Parts of Classes.) There is also a wiki-article for gunk. As to the contemporary state of physics, I'd like to point to the efforts of Arntzenius (2008), who argues that a point-free physics can get around some problems. Instead of points (which are indivisible) Arntzenius proposes gunky space or spacetime, which is thought to have 

The structure of Structuralism is made explicit by Jean Piaget in his "little" book, "Structuralism", 1970 Wholeness, where elements are governed by laws & not just an aggregate composite Transformation, dynamicity and change again according to rules or laws (In this sub-section 3 of the Introduction, on transformation, Piaget, referencing Godel' methods, is adamant that the relation between structuralism and constructivism is no longer avoidable. (That intuition provides much of what we then proceed to axiomize.) And thirdly, Self-regulation (& self-maintenance) which involves rhythm, regulation and operation as the mechanism In "Structuralism", also, Piaget cites the French group know as the Bourbaki. Piaget, however also states on p.27 of a chapter called "Mathematical and Logical Structures" and two years before Mac Lane's "Categories for the Working Mathematician" the following. What we have in mind are the "categories" of MacLane, Eilenburg, and others' The "categories" of of the new branch of the Bourbaki school are classes which comprise "functions" and therefore "morphisms" among their elements (a function, in the usual acceptance of the word, being the application of one set to another [or itself], obviously engenders isomorphisms, in fact every variety of "morphism".) Then on P. 28 he cites S. Papert's observation that "MacLane's categories are a device for laying hold of mathematical operations rather than of "mathematics" itself: they constitute yet another example of that reflective abstraction which derives its substance, not from objects, but from operations performed upon objects even when the latter are themselves products of reflective abstraction" In "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists" Benjamin C. Pierce quotes in the preface What we are probably seeking is a "purer" view of functions: a theory of functions in themselves, not a theory of functions derived from sets. What, then, is a pure theory of functions? Answer: category theory --Scott [104,p.406] What comes to mind when thinking about "pure" functions is the combinators invented by Moses Schönfinkel before Church's lambda-calculus. Combinatory logic is a computation model equal to the lambda calculus, but without lambda-abstraction, that is, no substitutions What combinatory logic does is the same as a basic term rewriting system. A reduction system. See the article in the on-line "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy" "Combinatory Logic" But what also comes to mind is constructive or Martin-Löf type theory that is yet another alternative to the foundations of mathematics. Their are categorical models of type theory. One model is Local Cartesian Closed Categories or LCCC, Seely & refined by Hoffman & Cybjer. Also universal algebra (A.N. Whitehead) is very similar to category theory by creating algebraic structure of closed sets of operations and data. (What object oriented programming aspires to but doesn't know it except for the writers of Smalltalk and Java) If structuralism is to describe all such systems and mathematics itself, it needs formal definition. Piaget may have been off to a good start in this respect as what he describes is either automata or a cybernetic system. J. Richard Buchi says in "Finite Automata, Their Algebras and Grammars", Dirk Siefkes, ed that the theory of automata subsumes all algebraic systems including universal algebra so I assume category theory, too. That is we can write a categorical theoretic program in Haskell or SASL. (I've a book by M. Arbib "Arrows, Structures, and Functors: The Categorical Imperative" where, I think the subtitle is "Thinking in Arrows") There's a number of books on category theory that do not require a PhD in mathematics Here is another "Categories, Types and Structures: An Introduction to Category Theory for the Working Computer Scientist", Andrea Asperti and Giuseppe Longo, 1991 

In John Searles 'Making the Social World" (2010), the chapter 'the purpose of this book' starts with declaring the following question as a fundamental question of contemporary philosophy: 

When can we truly say of something to be conceivable? What are its necessary and sufficient conditions? Is it like imagining? Is it just being consistent with everything we know? How many people have to conceive something in order for it to be conceivable? 

It seems to me that you are reading the wrong books, essays, websites, w/e. For a start, you probably shouldn't read Armstrong et al when you are doing philosophy as a hobby for a few months. I do not mean to be an arse, I just think it is helpful to start exactly where your problems are, at the basic stuff. Consider me doing a bit physics as a hobby for a few months, now I pick up the latest Journal and naturally I won't understand a bit of it. Learning philosophy is a quite slow process. And it is not going to be any faster by skipping all the basics. Quite the opposite, you don't understand much and get confused by technical terms. There are books exactly for this situation, e.g: the Cambrdige Introduction to Philosophy-Series; The Math you need to do philosophy; Philosophical Devices; for logic check out this site: $URL$ There are almost for every discipline excellent readers, one being e.g.: The Philosophy of Language, by Martinich. It covers all the things you just mentioned, the most influential essays, good forewords that explain all needed vocabulary. As to my little example of me jumping into contemporary physics. The language of physics os mostly math. A lot of people, me included, don't understand a word (or number ;)). Think of philosophy as the same: Just because its language is our natural language, doesn't mean it is not as hard to understand as the physics-essay. 

Not sure if it is what your looking for, but since you tagged it as philosophy of science...: Imre Lakatos developed a theory to weaken Poppers falsificationism. According to Lakatos, theories are never isolated, but part of chains of theories. Each part of a chain is a theory that shares with the other parts its hard core, consisting of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. To the hard core comes a weak hull, consisting of auxiliary hypotheses. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme - they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to 'protect' the 'hard core'. One feature of the theory of lakatos was that he allowed contradictions in the weak hull, as long as they are not permanent. In this sense he would allow an inconsistent physics. 

I agree that John is mostly wrong based on facts. Assuming he does not have other motives he, himself, must be employing the fallacy of exception. When Bob is defending him he is not defending his argument but his moral status. John was not lying, he was just wrong; his weak cognitive abilities and some indications that newborn kids are shorter formed his opinion. Mary just got a bit swept away that's all. From another point of view you can say that they are wrong because they did not follow Occam's principle stating that 'the argument with the fewest assumptions taken is most probably true'. I do not know what the negative of that is called. 

Because things that are not are more numerous and descriptive of being than the things we immediately see. While I am not well read in regards to Greek Idealism it seems that this definition extends the typical of what a form is as the essence of an object. In the idealist sense I understand the form to be a prototype object that every true object of this kind exist in reference to. Leonardo here uses a definition that is modern and mathematical in essence. An important dimension of mathematical work consists of identifying an object under question and abstracting it as much as possible in a way that the mathematical object could describe anything of that type. I.e. 2πr and 2π*r(squared) describe the geometric properties of any circle, not a specific circle, every cirlce. A circle with r = 5 meters we might have in front of us is not the essence of the circle because it is not every circle, but just one. The essence of the circle extends to the non-being circles that every existed and will exist. That is as with the being of humans, animals and trees. More will have existed and will exist than in our present and even more are their possibilities that will never exist but still would be described as human, animal and tree. In this sense the study of topology in mathematics is relevant, but only to a certain extend, because several geometric specific properties are included. Thus we can say that being and nothingness constitutes everything and there is a mathematical intuition for that. 

Something is true if it has been a fact in a time- and space-frame. i.e. something is part of real-ity if it is real, descrite and observable. The closest we can find paradoxes outside language and in physical reality is in computations that do not compute, for example, a computer programme that crashed. Reality never crashes, our interpretations of it do. Paradoxes always have an element of self-refentials, sort of a reference to their axioms, their basic structure or something like that (e.g. think of Russell's paradox). A paradox like 'nothing that I say is true' has this self-referential component that is analogous to a sentence like 'every sentence of this type has the verb after the subject' with an added element of 'crashing', as in being wrong. Semantically we understand it as procedure going 0->1->0->1... sort of a perpetual semantics machine. The short answer would be that this is an inherent pitfall of our language, a bug not a feature, that we should be careful for. We should be careful not to have conclusions that make as change our axioms, we should plan it that way. Paradoxes are not more interesting than that, feedback loops are much more interesting than that. But if you like you can create some sort of robot that chases its tail.
