Sargo are bottom feeders, and prefer crustaceans as their staple diet. The most reliable choices for bait include shrimp/prawns, mussels, squid, clams, and sea snails. People also catch them with worms, and small pieces of fish. Where they're plentiful, they'll eat other bait that people have on hand when catching similar fish in the same water. There's also another paste in addition to the one you mentioned. It's made from bread/flour and cheese, and the sargo seem to enjoy it.

I was recently told that there are organizations, at least in the United States, that study migration of monarch butterflies by tagging them. The purpose, as in most animal migration monitoring, is to learn as much as possible about the animal, keep that animal population safe, and enable researchers to educate people regarding various species. While banding and tagging of larger animals doesn't seem so difficult to me, I'm wondering some specific things about tagging a butterfly. 

Other sounds are called chatter, rattle, muk muk, to name only a few, though they're not specifically indicative of danger. Tail movements are equally as important when communicating in general, and research shows that certain tail movement/vocalization combinations are likely to indicate danger. Sometimes she sounds an alarm from the nest. Other times, she purposely separates herself first, so it's hard to know whether or not she'd speak up if you got close. Squirrels are very smart, and also have a keen sense of smell, so if you seem like a curious passerby that doesn't smell like an animal, she's more likely to just sit on or at the nest. If you reach out to touch it, that would be a different story, but since that's not your intention, time spent watering or walking around your trees is probably not enough to cause her to make much noise.

The main difference between alpaca and merino (or any other) wool is the fur itself. Alpaca is not technically wool, as it has a different construction. It's fiber, which is more like hair. Because Alpaca fiber is hollow, it has many advantages over merino wool. It's warmer, softer, more lightweight, thermal for use in all seasons. It's also durable. As for warmth: Studies done at the Yocum-McCall Testing Laboratories have this to say: 

Last year we visited some friends at their summer home in Lamoine, Maine, in Northeast United States. They took us to a place called Somes Sound, on Mount Desert Island. It's either in or near Acadia National Park, I can't remember which. In the ocean running under a bridge at the base of some large rocks, we saw a powerful and fascinating swirl of water which we were told was the only true fjord on the East Coast. My friends have recently returned for this summer, and I just received an email saying that, although it looks the same to them, the fjord had been "downgraded" to a fjard. What's the difference between the two, and why would the fjard be considered a "downgrade" in status? Edit: We just returned from another visit to the area in October of 2016. We learned that 

For storage up to three months, which is a bit longer than the trip in your question, regular room temperature is good. For 6-9 months, a cool dark area is recommended, with temperatures about 65° - 68° and 75% humidity. For extra long, up to 9-12 months, store in the refrigerator. In case you're interested, I found the result of an experiment done by Jamie, of Prepared Housewives. She treated a carton of 18 eggs with mineral oil according to the same method described above. She put those in the refrigerator, making sure to flip them every month, for a year. She also put a carton of 18 untreated eggs right beside them. At the end of the year, she published her findings in Preserving Eggs with Mineral Oil, 1 Year Later. As you said, the mark of a healthy egg is when it sinks to the bottom. She started there. Mineral oiled eggs: All 18 sunk straight to the bottom, except one, which had a crack in it. Untreated eggs: All 18 floated on the top. One of those also had a crack, with brown sediment oozing out of it. How well did they cook? Mineral oiled eggs: Looked perfect and tasted great. Untreated eggs: Cooked flat like a pancake. The texture was also different, slightly rubbery. The linked page has pictures of eggs during each phase of the procedure. The final picture below shows the dramatic difference after cooking them over-easy. She ate the treated egg. 

When I go to the beach, I love to look at sea shells. I never take them with me because they're vital to the eco-system. I just gently pick them up, have a close look and sometimes take pictures, then put them back where they were. It's very important to me not to bother any animals. In the case of certain mollusks like clams and mussels, a closed shell is an indication of life. Barnacles, seaweed and a variety of other living things are easily spotted. Snail shells are beautiful, varied and interesting, but it's not always easy to tell if there's a live snail inside, especially because they can go so far in that you can't see them. According to Snail Facts, 

Charlie Brumbaugh gave you excellent information about land turtles. It may be exactly the same for aquatic species, but I'd really like to provide you with information about those. Unfortunately, it's turning out to be more complicated than I thought. If you don't mind, I wanted to at least post something, even though it's not exactly what you need yet. I'll probably have to make some phone calls to experts in order to get fully accurate information. I promise to come back with reputable sources, or delete it if it's just taking up a lot of space without really being helpful. If some kind soul comes along with the right answer, that would be great! The closest thing I've found so far pertains to the Western Painted Turtle, (Chrysemys picta belli). According to this fact sheet, an early thaw can be dangerous indeed. 

Many additional studies indicate that the witness of what seems to be a delay in migration is actually time spent loading up on food and calories in order for the migration to be successful. Some birds actually increase their body weight by 100% before making the trip. The report of one such study, authored by a professor at the University of Rhode Island, can be found here. For these reasons, I believe that people can leave feeders up all year long without worrying that they're interfering with the natural process of migration. 

She compiled a list called "10 reasons why Mumbaikars need to save the sparrow". I removed the tenth because I found conflicting evidence from other sources. The bullet points are hers, but also include information from other sources that said the same thing. 

Because there are so many different migratory birds, each with their own unique pattern, this is a rather broad question. The answer, therefore, will be based on the general study of migration, rather than individual birds. Migration is an extremely complex process, and a large amount of research into contributing factors is ongoing all over the world. One essential part of that research is rooted in backyard bird feeding and how it affects migration. Variables are many, and include bird species, age, gender, health, and experience, to name just a few. To put this large body of work into simple terms, it's generally accepted that birds who plan on migrating will do so whether or not food remains available. The primary migration triggers are change in the amount of daylight, also known as photoperiod; and change in air temperature. The Cornell University Lab of Ornithology in New York is considered a world leader in the study, understanding and conservation of birds. Your question was posed to them as part of their many interactive bird-watching projects. From their answer: 

In my town, which is a neighborhood in a suburban location in Massachusetts, barefoot walking is common once the summer starts. I'm old and stay cold longer than most, so I don't even switch over to sandals until long after people like you have taken off your shoes! My "winter feet" are soft and vulnerable, so it takes time to build the callous and thicker skin my "summer feet" need to protect from burning (to a degree), and being vulnerable to some of the small shards of things. I advise looking out for bigger rocks/stones. As your feet get bigger, so do the spaces between your toes, leaving you more susceptible to something getting caught between them, or in the space (arch) under your foot. Those can make you fall, and can be true on all the different surfaces you mentioned. In the most polite way possible, I'd also like to mention droppings from animals (scat). We have strict laws about cleaning up after your dog on the sidewalk or on people's lawns, but I don't know if you have that. Still, I have to remember to frequently look down on the sidewalks and roads as I walk. The same is true in your yard and on the trails. There can be diseases present in the scat, and sometimes hard things like berries which stick in your feet. You probably know all that, since that falls into your Mum's category of diseases. Animals also dig in the yard, and along the trail. I've often stepped into holes I didn't know were there and twisted toes and even an ankle. I even fell once and hurt my knee. Shoes can be helpful for support at times like that. I spend many hours in my garden during the summer, and always keep something on my feet, usually sneakers. There are a few more things that pertain to all of the areas where you walk. Tree "droppings" can be annoying, and potentially dangerous too. Nuts and acorns can be tripped over. Sap can be sticky and liable to cause a fall. Pinecones can be sharp enough to cause open sores. If people on your street have lots of trees, that may be an issue. The same is true along the trails you mentioned. Also in the yard and on the trails, certain insects, like ants, can bite if you step on them, and bees can sting. There's a type of bee called a miner (or mining) bee that builds its nest in the ground, like anthills, and they can sting if you step on them. As I got older, I would go deeper into the woods and encounter things I didn't used to before I hit your age. If you're doing that, you might be technically in more danger of hurting your feet. You obviously know about things like rusty nails, discarded bottle caps and other sharp litter. Since you're an experienced barefoot-walker, I'll bet you've been careful of those your whole life! In my area, younger kids leave things lying around on the sidewalks, like small toys, or even bigger things like skateboards. I've often had to step out of the way, or over these things, so as not to trip. Shoes can offer protection if you do step on something like that. This may sound silly, but as I got older, I paid a lot less attention to what was on the ground and more to the people I was walking with, like friends. If that pertains to you, it might worry your Mum. You didn't say that though, so I don't want to put words in her mouth! If you don't mind, I'd like to share a quick story from my life. When I became a teenager, I was allowed to go alone or with friends into stores, restaurants, and other places where bare feet weren't allowed, so my Mum made a strict rule not to leave home without shoes on. That's just my experience of mine, and doesn't answer your question! You obviously have an excellent Mum who cares enough to worry about you, and has also taught you to be mature enough to come to a place like this and ask for advice. I hope our suggestions can be helpful to you. 

Alpaca is also less likely to cause itching. Sheep's wool fur has tiny scales along the edges, whereas alpaca fiber is more smooth. 

To confirm, here's a list of Ohio's 12 species of turtles. In the description of the midland turtle, it says 

Other sources also list that as an important consideration, and add that in general, alpaca doesn't become moldy or grow mildew. This is helpful when you're traveling. You don't need to spend a lot of time stopping to let it dry, and you don't need to worry about it spreading mold to your other clothes. It also doesn't smell bad. 

They can also be held as a stabilizer while you put the shoes on, but without tugging. My podiatrist and orthopedist recommend not using it as a tool to pull on the footwear, even if it's high quality. After a year or two, especially if used frequently, that's enough to alter the shape. That causes breakdown of the inner structure so you lose proper support of the feet, heels and ankles. Eventually the legs and back can be affected, as they're relying on your feet for strength and proper posture. Also, shoes with a compromised shape may have a shorter life, which we all like to avoid, especially since they're so expensive! I've been instructed to unlace enough of whatever type of shoe I use so my foot can slip in easily. Holding that tag is a great way to keep it in place during that process. 

World-renowned ornithologist, Arthur Cleveland Bent, compiled a large group of studies and visual reports of grackles and their behavior dating back to the late 1800s. The following is a quote from Witmer Stone in 1937, published by Mr. Bent: 

We saw this magnificent white tiger in a wildlife rehabilitation center in the United States. I don't like seeing animals out of their natural habitat, but all of these animals were rescued from circuses or zoos, and are not able to be returned to the wild. Usually these places have signs by the animal enclosures so we can learn about the animals, but I didn't see any information there. This especially intrigued me because I don't think I've ever seen a white tiger before, even on television. Where does this breed of tiger usually live? What are some other important facts about it?
