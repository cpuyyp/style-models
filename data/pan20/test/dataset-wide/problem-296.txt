We would be awake at "night". There would be no dark sun when woke up, and the moon would cast its shadow over our activities. There would be less push to invent light sources, why invent light when all you need to do is go in the basement? However, when we wanted to sleep, we'd open the blinds all the way, to get some of that relieving darkness. I don't think it would be too different from modern times, except less windows and more activity underground. It might prove disorienting though, if your main character crossed over to there from here. Otherwise, it could be just like earth, except with darkness and light inverted. In a different realm, people could see by shadows, like we see by light. Maybe it's an alternate earth dimension. 

I know about humans, and how we have adapted to different eviornments with skin and hair color, but I want something a little bit different for my creatures. They are amphibious humanoids, and live on a planet with about 85% water, and with no land masses larger than Australia. Their planet is close enough to earth that humans can survive on it with no problems. Now, what I had in mind was there being a variety of different skin colors, namely purple, red, blue, green, and yellow. But what purpose would this fulfill? Under what circumstances would creatures evolve to have many different skin pigments? 

I was thinking, and I came up with an idea. Have three stars of equal mass orbiting a single point, with all stars in the same plane. But is there any way to make this possible? If not, is there a way to make three stars of equal mass have a stable system? 

I've been working on building a society for my story, but I've run into what I consider to be a significant problem. What are the different professions required to maintain a society of a technological level of ~1800? How much demand is there for these professions compared to each other? (Such as you need X amount of farmers as opposed to X amount of blacksmiths.) 

These leeches should feed off of blood. Human blood should be preferred, although I would be okay if they also fed off of other animal's blood. Humans should also be their primary host, if not the sole one. These leeches are a quarter of an inch to a half an inch wide, and of varying lengths. These leeches infest their human host, feeding off their blood. A single worm is extra small and smart, and it infects the brain, controlling the body parts. other worms assist the human host in its movement. Smashing the person's brain, or damaging it enough, would make the host unusable, because the worm would not be able to control the body. To adress Wylia's comment, the worms can target pretty much anywhere. But it is a requirement that you can kill the zombie by bashing its head in. Also, I don't know how they reproduce, probably similar to tape/ring/worms or leeches. I always imagined the worm thingies just burrowing into people's skin. Zombification should probably only take about five minutes. 

So, how do the inhabitants of one species kill the other ones without destroying the other planet? If one planet is destroyed it throws the other out of its orbit with potentially disastrous consequences. Also, radioactive weapons are impossible to manufacture, because it would kill all the aliens who would make the bombs. Not only this, but these species are similar enough that they are affected by the same diseases. So, how would one civilization wipe out the other and leave both planets habitable? The moon doesn't have to survive, but the planets' orbit must be left mostly unchanged. Edit - The moon could be unnatural, put there by these alien species. I don't care about the stability of the moon's formation, but there is a sizable body of something that orbits these two planets. 

Now that You've heard me drone on and on, let's get back to the original question. With magical abilities such as these, how would the architecture and design of castles change to combat these threats? Would castles even be practical? 

They Believe In Helping People You said that this religion began with a lot of outposts providing refuge to people in trouble areas. Judging from this, it would seem likely that a tenet of their religion would be helping those in need. If their religion exists in a place that is often involved in a war, perhaps the leaders came to the conclusion that the best way to help is through medicine. That would explain why their clerical schools would move towards becoming medical schools, and help explain why. And since their religion is focused on medicine, taking off a lot of strain on the government for medical facilities, that would explain why the government gives them such free reign. It Puts Them In A Position Of Power As AndreiROM pointed out, it would put the church in a position of power. A lot of people would be dependent on their care, and should they see fit to abuse that privilege, well, there would not be a lot that could be done. 

I would say, do what the Netherlands do. Make earth and stone walls around the civilization. This way they would not have to move in the drought/flood seasons. If they make their buildings underground, they could make stone structures whose roofs would be at ground level. That way they would not have seepage into their homes. They could rebuild damaged sections of wall during the drought periods. As for the animals, well, they'd better learn to move or die. These animals likely wouldn't need the humanoids' help because they have survival instincts. If it's uncomfortably dry, go somewhere wetter. 

I read a book a while by Brandon Mull, and in the series Beyonders, they have a zombie plague. It is cause by little worms with hive minds. These worms knit together wounds, and somehow work together to move the body, like a second set of muscles. They feed off of the blood of their victims, and take their bodies. I find this scenario the most realistic, otherwise, how would a zombie stay in one piece, or get anywhere at all? Why would it feed on flesh, like in the walking dead? The food is irrelevant to their survival, and they don't think or breathe, so their brain would be dead and they'd have no reason to go eat people. But man, do these nasty little worms crave blood. I don't think prions are realistic, because once the body becomes significantly damaged, then you have brain death, which mains you cannot move. Besides, what purpose would prions have with eating people? Unless these prions somehow supplied the brain with oxygen, and made sure the body was not damaged, they wouldn't be very intimidating. Break its leg and it can only drag itself very slowly, or crawl. I recommend using some kind of parasite, because then there is an actual purpose to the madness of their violence. Also, some people might have a smidgeon of reason, maybe enough to barely keep a hold on themselves, or enough to strategize how to catch people. This might make your zombie apocalypse more dangerous and interesting. 

I don't think that much would change, except lying would be infinitely harder, and people would literally have events that embarrassed them for life. While you may remember a lot of things that would improve your life, no-one would ever forget a little lie you told, or that really embarrassing moment. This might make it so that making mistakes or doing dumb things were more easily forgiven at first, then more severely looked down upon later. 

Is it possible to add a moon to this system and have it be stable for at least 10 billion years? Also, at what distance would this moon have to be? How fast would it orbit these two planets? Bonus points if you can make a diagram of its orbit. 

Take Turns One king's eldest son is the ruler, and the other king's son is his closest advisor. When the King dies, the eldest son of the advisor becomes the new King, while the eldest son of the dead King becomes his advisor. That way, it is always clear which King holds more clout in decisions. 

No! Again, slashy things! Slashy things need their strength, which you have just deprived it of. Also, there is no way to make your sharp blade move without making some kind of scaled thing, and then the areas where they connect will be awful. 

I have an alien species that is my pet project. Now I'm to reproduction, which I have a specific idea for, I'm just not sure exactly how it works. My creatures are aquatic, and everything goes on underwater. The female lays eggs, which are probably about the size and shape of a golfball. The male fertilizes them soon after, then coats the eggs in his saliva. These creatures then need to grow, still inside the egg, to a football shaped thing about a foot long, at which point they will emerge from their eggs. The areas these eggs are laid in are nearly stagnant pools of freshwater, such as lake bottoms, swamps, bayous, deltas, meres, or ponds. You get the idea. Probably. These creatures are capable of producing electrical signals, using them for hunting, visualizing their surroundings, and possible for communication. So during the later egg development small aquatic creatures could potentially be lured in using electrical signals. If that helps at all. These creatures are humanoid, and are on average about 4.5-5 feet tall. You can assume their dietary needs are about that an electric eel, only scaled up. The main issues I see are the actual egg, which I assume would have to be some kind of membrane capable of growing. I was thinking of having the male's saliva help digest nutrients, which would then be absorbed by the membrane, feeding it and the creature within. The question is, is this feasible from a biological standpoint? If not, how can I make it more so? 

Short Answer No! Longer Answer Never in a million years! No matter what, you will always have fighting on Earth. If you don't mind me quoting a little scripture, “We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion." D&C 121:39. During nearly all of human history there has been war. It's just human nature. And it doesn't help that you will always have those people who just like to start fights, or those crazy murderous people. 

First, let me say that the state of Deseret would not maintain its independence. The LDS people believed and still do, that the constitution was created by men who were inspired to do the right thing. They would try to join the US, and it would be tricky for this to occur. The sentiment at the time was that Mormons were evil, and they were shunned and kicked out the the US. The US at the time, or at least their politicians, would have to have a total change of heart. Which may or may not be possible, you would have to flesh that out. 

The Gibble I created a species of flying creatures a few years ago. They're like a mixture of Blimps and manta rays. They are shaped like manta rays, and have an air sack they fill with gases like helium using special gill like filters. They use the appendages by their mouths to catch other flying prey (perhaps HDE's little pufferpolyp friends). These creatures also fly in swarms, with the females in the middle. The babies grow on the mother's belly in a special clear sack. This means the females have larger air sacks; so they can carry their babies. The babies learn how the males protect the females, see their parents catch food, etc. Once they are fully developed and ready to fly, they either puncture the sack, or spit acid on it to dissolve it. I haven't decided which. Life goes on (for everyone but the pufferpolyps). These creatures would have a lifespan of about twenty years, and they periodically refill their air sacks. Their filters can control the amount and type of gas in these sacks, to adjust the elevation the creature sides at. If they died of disease or old age in the air, their sacks would slowly leak and they'd drift to the ground. Or they'd be eaten by some other creature first. While these creatures may look like manta rays, they are very different on the inside. Their bones would be hollow, their "wings" would catch up drafts, and their wingspan be more along the lines of three feet, instead of three yards. (Scaled down from actual manta rays.) 

For my fantasy world, I have what I think is a really cool idea. The world is flat, and elliptical in shape. If you touch the silvery edge, well, let's just say bad things will happen. (Not relevant...) This edge is an impenetrable, indestructible wall. This world is like a coin, with two sides. Each side is the same (for the purposes of the question), and the giant island slopes downward until it meets itself. This leaves most of the ocean without a solid floor. Assume that gravity is magically inclined to drag everything down to the equator of the "coin". with 1g of force, and this gravity is the same all around. The world has a high "ceiling" of sorts, above each surface, uniformly heating and lighting each side of the coin. ~72°F That is the full extent of the world, no sun, moon, or stars for you to be concerned about. If an object sunk into the sea, it would sink until it reached the bottom of the oceans, a mile from each surface. A fish happily swimming on one side would appear upside down from the other. My question is, how would aforementioned changes affect the ocean? 

I think it would make more sense if you had one "female" gender and a previously selected number of "male" genders. These males would each provide some parts of the child's DNA, while the mother gives the child the rest of the DNA and births it. However, you would need to have some way to differentiate between these "male" genders. Each different gender could have something it's better at. Now, while this isn't totally true, bear with me. Men are generally more muscular and stronger than women. Women are more articulate and detail oriented. For your species, one male gender could be physically strong, another extremely intelligent, and a third would have heightened senses. Then you'd have the mother, who would be more like a regular human woman.
