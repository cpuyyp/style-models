I spoke with someone and they said they were staying off certain trails because snow melt and mud would ruin the trails. I had never thought of this and really want to be considerate. Is this a valid concern? Should I avoid a trail because of this? How do I know when it is ok to use? 

I was looking to buy a new MTB and was wondering if a purchase of a frame and components separately was cheaper then buying a bike with everything? I would assembling everything myself instead of a LBS. I suppose the bike manufacturers get volume discounts for some stuff, but not sure if they pass along those savings or not. 

It depends what you use it for. The primary advantage I have from my helmet is not hitting the branches with my head, when riding in forest. For that I don't need a new one each 2 years. I even heard that this is actually what bike helmets were made for in the first place. 

I generally go silent. In case the road is blocked completely I slow down, choose a side and say "Excuse me." just behind the ear, so it's clear where I need my space. If going in the opposite direction, I lean my head to my chosen side. It's is clear enough signal to allow me to pass on the left in my right-hand traffic country, when I choose. Adults are pretty predictable, in case they stand sideways I pass behind. For children I leave at least 1m space, slow down and look for possible distractions and points of interest, to predict unpredictable. 

I am going to build my first wheel using the Ryde V38 rim (Westwood type). The shop where I ordered the rim, says it has 5.5 mm spoke holes. The nipples that come with the regular 2.34 mm (13 g) spokes are specified to have a 5.9 mm nipple head diameter. It seems like that is a rather small overlap, so I am wondering if I should use "large head nipples" (7 mm) instead? 

The main differences to the drive train is the length of the rear derailleur arm. MTBs have lower and wider spaced gearing which means the rear derailleur has to handle a bigger span in chain length. A MTB typically has a large chainring with 42 teeth and a small one with 22 and a rear cassette with 12 - 28 tooth span - so the chain has to fit both a 42+28 combo and a 22+12 combo. That makes for a span of 70 - 34 = 36 teeth. On a typical road bike, the biggest combo is 52+22 and the smallest is 42+11, thus a span of 72 - 53 = 19 teeth. In order to keep the chain tight, the derailleur has to be able to "suck up" 17 more chain links on a MTB, which is why it has a longer arm. 

From my experience the biggest loss in grip between MTB tires and slicks is on the sand (especially sand on tarmac), mud and snow. On ice there is no grip in either case. On wet surface the slicks are actually better and this makes the border conditions thinner, you either grip well or skid completely. 

You can straighten a bent wheel by hitting the lawn (or something soft -- not to damage the braking surface). You need to take it in hands on 8:00-4:00 with the bulge pointing downwards and hit appropriately hard. Repeat few times correcting for the bulge position and direction until you can ride. I did that twice and both wheels are still in use. One of those is so true (after some spoke tweaking), that you would never say that it was bend to the point it wouldn't go through the fork. The brake pads leave less than 1mm space on both sides. 

I just received a pair of wheels that I ordered online. They are a replacement for a 1940'es vintage bike that now only takes "wulst"-type tires, which are only available in very poor quality at very high prices. The rims are of the Westwood type. The front wheel looks perfect, with all spokes being a bit shorter than the nipples. But on the rear wheel almost all the spokes protrude clearly into the (single wall) rim. Most of them just a bit, but maybe 10-15 of them seem more than 0.5 mm too long and I measured the worst 4-5 of them to protrude around 1.5 mm. Surely rim tape will cover some protrusion, but how much? Will rim tape be enough to protect the tubes from this or should I go through the hassle of returning the wheel? I'd really prefer to just slap them on the bike and not think too much about it, but on the other hand I bought these wheels to get better tires and fewer flats. Here is an example from the rear wheel: 

What tire size will fit a Schwala Xero 220 rim? Can it take any 700C tire? I am having trouble figuring out what size tires could possibly fit this rim: $URL$ The closest I see is this rim size: 700C*20*19MM. 

Just a 10mm allen wrench was needed. Looking at the head for the bolt, it looks special, but its not, so I was deceived. Probably not a traditional bolt head, as the axle must fit through it. 

I was looking around for new wheels and thoroughly confused about the common approach to freehubs. Do they usually come with the freehub or do I have to actually put that on? If they do come with it, why in the world do none of the listings actually say anything about sizes? Specifically, I was looking at this $URL$ which shows one in the picture, but does not give any specs. 

The other day I read a question about heat induced brake fade in hydraulic disc brakes caused by too much braking on long, steep descents, which is something I have also experienced when cycling in the alps. (A quite unpleasant experience, I might add.) This made me wonder if mechanical disc brakes would suffer from the same problem. There is no fluid to start boiling, so at first thought they should be heat-fade-proof. If so, I think an optimized disc brake system would have hydraulic activation of a short mechanical lever or wire connected to the caliper itself. This way the system would optimize modulation (by minimizing elasticity) while still being safe to brake for extended periods. I realize that even with mechanical brakes, you can't brake indefinitely, as the pads, calipers and discs would overheat at some point, but if the margin is large enough to cover most practical uses, the idea might be worth exploring. So I'd like to hear from people with mechanical disc brakes if they have experienced heat induced fade? 

First of all for anything to work you must be visible. I have a few reflective straps on my backpack and I turn the lights on when it's darkish. I don't believe it can hurt you. Lights are much more effective safety measure than a helmet. The biggest cause of bike accidents are cars not giving way and running over the cyclist from behind. Bikers cause less than a half of the biker-involved accidents, primary biker death cause in Poland last year are not giving way either on intersections or crossings -- over 70%, another 7% is inappropriate lighting. For the cars in front of me: I wear a hat with a big Jolly Roger. I guess the producer was targeting Emo children, but it fits perfectly and I even get away with driving in the left lane (everybody thinks I'm crazy). As mentioned, eye contact is very important. If in doubt I always aim at the rear of the car and just get back into the traffic behind it. Predict and be ready for the worst case. For the cars behind you just don't keep so close to the curb and only get closer when you hear a car approaching. This buys me enough space. 

I have been trying to ride on some trials that have very soft sand and especially agitated by ATVs. When I hit a soft patch my front tire pulls in one direction and I freak out a little. I cannot seem to plow through it and ultimately just end up moving slower and slower, which than leads to a full stop. Is there some trick or style to riding on these trails? 

I would like to remove rust from some old parts such as cassette, bolts, and nuts. Most of the rust is just surface rust, and I would think there would be a good technique for doing this. Besides using steel wool, I have heard of either using ultra-sonic washer or an acid bath. What is the best way to accomplish this? I would prefer to stay away from chemicals.
