I know the problem : you either get books on the science vs faith theme or you find books trying to vindicate the rationality of (usually Christian) faith. Something less polemical or 'apologetic' and more conceptual is required. Try any or all of these : Basil Mitchell : How to Play Theological Ping-Pong: And Other Essays on Faith and Reason Published by Eerdmans Pub Co ISBN 10: 0802805442 ISBN 13: 9780802805447 Paul Helm :Faith and Understanding (Reason & Religion) (Reason and Religion) ISBN 10: 0748609229 / ISBN 13: 9780748609222 Published by Edinburgh University Press 01/07/1997, 1997 J.

Michalson : The Rationality of Faith: An Historical Critique of Theological Reason Published by SCM (1964) John A Hutchison : Faith, Reason and Existence Published by Oxford University Press, New York USA (1956) I don't think there is an ideal book but you should find something of what you want in at least one or some of these. 

What the realistic chances are that we will adopt an enviromnmentally-friendly way of life, I don't know - I am not optimistic. But the three points above still apply. 

Therefore it is raining (false) 'If it is raining, then the pavements are wet' - true conditional. 'The pavements are wet' - true consequent. They really are wet. But it isn't raining - false antecedent. The pavements are wet because a water main has burst. Hope this helps, makes things a bit clearer : it shows that your question was spot on. Your logical instincts are sound. 

Philosophy involves a quest for knowledge. Both Jesus and Mohammad possessed all knowledge requisite to their missions, if one accepts their teachings, without having to seek knowledge. Knowledge was given to them. If one does not accept their teachings then it must still be conceded that they believed themselves to possess all knowledge requisite to their missions, and so did not need to seek it and therefore were not philosophers. This is not to say that their teachings do not suggest philosophical questions, e.g. about the attributes of God or the nature of free will. But one is not a philosopher simply because what one says prompts philosophical questions. In my view the proper status of neither Jesus nor Mohammad is altered one whit by whether they were philosophers or not. 

▻ DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE ('DJ') DJ occurs in the allocation of rewards, resources, rights, obligations, costs and burdens - any benefit or disbenefit that has to be allocated to a number of people. If I slice a cake at a children's party, I divide the cake into equal portions : each child gets the same amount because I do not favour any particular child. In fixing salaries I might allocate payment on the basis of 'to each according to their work', 'to each according to their needs', 'to each the same' or some such formula or principle. In making redundancies - a disbenefit - I might 'let people go' on the basis that the newest staff are the first to lose their jobs. ▻ EQUITY Equity applies not in the field of distribution of benefits or disbenefits (as above). It is mainly about fair exchange - the mutually beneficial transfer of valued resources. In any situation there is usually an input/ output ratio that is fair or would widely be judged to be fair. It is hard to fix or define this ratio in advance but, for instance, if your input was 12 hours' hard work in cleaning my house, and my output was a payment to you of $1 or £2 or €3, the ratio does not seem proper or right. My output (payment) is disproportionately low in relation to your input : there is an inequitable ratio. ▻ CONVERGENT USAGE There are other uses or meanings of equity by which equity and DJ come out the same : some might say that if I pay different salaries to two groups of workers doing identical work in two different factories, this is inequitable. This reduces equity to a form of DJ : if this situation is inequitable it is because I am not paying to each according to their work. The account given of equity at the start marks out different work for the terms 'equity' and 'DJ'. We need both concepts, not the reduction of equity to DJ. 

Propaganda can be true. It is merely communicative discourse addressed to a mass audience for the purpose for getting the audience to accept a particular view or to support a particular policy. Refinements are possible but that's basically what it is - and clearly, despite 'propaganda's present-day primarily negative connotations, the view may be correct and the policy just and efficient. P1 - call this propaganda which is true (like much of the Allied propaganda directed against National Socialist Germany in 1939-45). P2 - call this propaganda which is false. Much of the 'communicative discourse' used by the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe in later years was false. As was that used by the Apartheid regime in South Africa. P3 - call this half-truth propaganda. An example would be a claim made by the Spanish Embassy (UK) in the 1960s that Franco ended the Spanish Civil War (1936-9). The Embassy failed to mention that Franco also started the war. Fake news - this is a vague and evolving term. It seems primarily to mean false stories circulating on social or mass media. This makes a straight link with P2. If there is a difference, and I'm doubtful, it is that 'propaganda' has traditionally been associated with governments and states. 'Fake news', by contrast, has usually no such central political source. 

You tell me that Queen Victoria died in 1901. I seem to remember reading that it was a different year. I can question your claim, raise a doubt about its truth, without assuming that you don't know or are not telling the truth. In fact she did die in 1901 and my own memory is false. You do know and are telling the truth. You tell me that drug X is the most effective available against tooth-ache - it is the fastest-working and most powerfully analgesic. I can question this without assuming or implying that you don't really know (though you might not) or are trying to deceive me. 

Try : (1) Who Was Nietzsche's Genealogist? Elijah Millgram, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 75, No. 1 (Jul., 2007), pp. 92-110. Pretty critical and not unsubtle. Attacks (2). (2) Nietzsche on Ressentiment and Valuation Author(s): Bernard Reginster Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 57, No. 2 (Jun., 1997), pp. 281-305. Not an attempt to demolish N's account but none the less a critical examination and in the final para. the suggestion of a different, subversive critique. Useful exposition of N's concept of ressentiment, which might pull some ideas together. (3) Nietzsche's Conscience Aaron Ridley, Journal of Nietzsche Studies, No. 11, Conscience and Pain, Tragedy and Truth. Examines problems in the relationship between ressentiment and bad conscience - unusual angle ? (4) Nietzsche's Radicalization of Kant William W. Sokoloff, Polity, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 2006), pp. 501-518. Tries to synthesise Kant and Nietzsche. Not much but some of it might help.
