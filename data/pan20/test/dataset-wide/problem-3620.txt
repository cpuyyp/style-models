In my (limited) experience I would recommend using the Smart Coach to set yourself speed goals. The tool speeds you up gently over a 12-16 week period (or less amount of time if you're feeling like a challenge). It gives you an indurance run, a gentle run and speed training each week. I only use it for 10k running so I can't speak for half or full marathon running, but it really improved my pace a lot - down to about 46 mins from 50+ mins. 

Use a running track. Sprint 100m as fast as you can, then jog the rest. Repeat 5 times. Treadmill version: 20 second sprint, 60 seconds jog. "Enjoy a metabolism increase of 40%" 

The advice I was given by a professional physiotherapist was to concentrate on stride length, and landing on the back of the foot/heel (I pronate though, so this was probably foot shape specific). It may have been very generic advice and not something an Olympic champion would care about, but it helped my pace/lap time quite a lot. Squats and glute exercises are worth considering too, especially if you are increasing your mileage fairly quickly, both help if you suffer from shin-splints. 

Another exercise involves using the elbow to massage the back, with a fair amount of pressure - obviously you'll need a partner/friend/willing house mate to do it though, and it hurts. 

It features in Rocky therefore has all the associations related to that film. Egg yolks have lots of fat in, however egg whites are really just water and protein (about 90% water and 10% protein). They would be slightly cheaper than chicken if you don't mind eating 10 of them. Chicken however has a lot more protein as a percentage - 24% compared to 3%. It'd be cheaper and less labor-intensive to simply eat protein shakes or chicken. 

This is wikipedia's answer, which I've been led to believe are the reason for the sensation both during and after exercise. 

The way to increase you lung capacity (vo2 max) is to perform interval training and sprinting, one technique is known as Fartleks. The more you push your lungs (and get out of breath for short periods), the greater your capacity becomes, at least up to a point. One interesting device that is a fairly cheap that claims to improve your inspiratory muscles is the Powerbreathe. It works by you blowing into the device, and it providing resistance for both. Like push ups or press ups, you increase the amount you do each day, and also increase the resistance. 

The main problem with eating breakfast before a work out is you have to wait an hour or more for it to be digested. For jogging, a lot of people prefer to eat a carbohydrate rich meal before bed to avoid the wait in the morning. If you aren't doing anything intense, a low speed 30 minute jog for example, this probably isn't necessary. But for more intense work outs you will use your glycogen supplies quickly without carb-loading the night before. You'll then get tired and do less, and lose lean tissue. So the choice for running is a low intensity jog on a piece of fruit or drink, or mid-high intensity with a meal the night before. 

The secret to feeling full is combining protein with carbohydrates, which also gives you the added benefit of aiding the transport of the increased Tryptophan from the protein. There's a tonne of studies to support this, to quote one: 

If you look at the nutrition value of the bar it looks like their claims are largely BS. The product has high amounts of sugar and seems to fit into the mid-to-high GI/GL bracket so won't be providing a slow intake of energy (low GI foods are associated with this). And the feeling full factor is likely to come from the 500ml of water you're drinking with it rather than the bar. 

What type of exercise? If it's short burst exercise such as the anaerobic exercise of body building, then simple carbohydrates are better: baked potato with cheese. For long aerobic exercise such as marathon running, slow burning complex carbohydrates work best - pitta breads, pasta. This book goes into a lot more detail: 

I experienced quite bad stitch when I first started running, and after some casual research discovered my problem was coming from: 

As you're not a professional athlete (I'm guessing), or even if you were, it's really whatever works best for your body based on the sport and the food which takes a few months of trial and error. 

4 exercises I was given by an osteopath when I had fairly chronic muscular lower back pain were all leg related: 

What weight training exercises can I do with dumbbells that will benefit me most for running 5-10ks? Are stomach crunches/sit ups worth doing too? 

I've never managed to get below 46 minutes for a 10k because there is actually quite a big fitness and training gap with just those two minutes. As Rhea points out it's down to miles per week and then raising the tempo from 4:36 km/minute to 4:30 (I think) or using another strategy such as increasing the tempo post 5k. Increasing the weekly mileage will make shaving a few seconds per minute off easier, however the speed training is important for the races as you're rarely able to keep one consistent pace with a lot of runners. I've linked it a few times on the site but the Runner's World Smart Coach can really help, and also doing the speed training on a treadmill. I realise that as someone who hasn't done a sub 45 minute race my advice is really just anecdotal, however I believe enough miles per week turns it into a breeze. 

The "official" distance for long distance running - as used by IAAF and IOC - is 3 km (1.86 miles) (Wikipedia)- but having said that most runners equate "long distance running" and "endurance running" and thus consider 3-15 km as middle distance and only longer distances as long-distance. One of my running mates - who run 20-25 marathons plus a couple of 100 km races every year(!!) - considers everything less than 42 km as middle distance, whereas his wife considers everything over 3 km as an impossible long distance! So "long distance running" is what you want it to be. If you run 10 km a couple of times every week and consider that long, then it is long distance to you! 

I have hurt my shoulder so for the next 2-4 weeks I have to be a little careful with my training. The daily running is properly OK as long as I keep away from the most challenging trail runs, but the daily dose of the plank has to be replaced for the duration with something a little more gentle. But what are the good alternatives to the plank if it a part of a daily morning exercise? 

I have had the same sorts of issue with my back some time ago. I really don't know what is wrong with your back, and can thus only speak from my own experience. I have used an exercise ball at work for some years and it has helped a lot. I also have a height-adjustable desk and stand up approximately 50% of the day - I do not have a regular office chair any more! Just the exercise ball and the height-adjustable desk. Every morning, I use 10 minutes for some (very light) core training and stretching which I also think has helped. I have no ideas how long it will take before you will see any real difference, but I will guess that a few weeks should make some difference (at least, that is how I remember my case). 

One of my teams mates tried something different some years back in a very similar situation: He simply spent 5-7 weeks where he didn't run on roads at all, but instead went for long walks - 10-15 km - in his running shoes. As I recollect, he walked for 2 x 1 hour the first week and ended with 3 x 3 hours the last week. He did experience some mild shin pains in the beginning, but that went away after a few weeks. After this he moved to walk-run and followed a regular beginners 10 week program until he got to 5 km. He is running fine now with very few problems. Whether this will work for anybody else, I have no ideas. But I'm very, very sure you have to be very disciplined to not start running too soon if you feel everything is fine. 

In context of running, one of the most discussed subjects over the last many years probably have been whether "Natural Running" will prevent injuries or actually be the source of injuries. I have looked at the many, many references you can find on the web if you search for "natural running injuries" and to me it looks like you can easily confirm any initial views or assumptions no matter what you think of the subject. With other words, it is extremely difficult to find objective investigation - let alone research - into this subject. From discussions on my local running team, the general agreement seem to be that natural running is good for your legs in general - especially your shins, knees and hips - but it is bad when it comes to plantar fasciitis. Which kind of make sense to me, as your steps are shorter, but the archs under the feet must handle more pressure. [As I have almost continuous problems with shin sprints, I wonder if I should try to switch. But I have also had some rather serious problems with PF in the past, which I really, really don't want to repeat..] Thus the question: Are there any (conclusive) research in this field? Has anybody figured out if natural running is good, bad or just same-same? 

As @Sarge says, this is for a doctor to diagnose properly. I had something similar - or rather with the same symtoms as I understand you - 3-4 years ago as I first started to run for races: stress fracture foot. Basically, this is very small stress induced fractures in the bones of the foot - though it can be in any bone in the body in theory. Very often a result of too much running :-) Only you doc can tell you for sure with an MR scanning or similar. Ohh, and the bad news is that the only real solution is to stop running for an extended period. In my case 4-5 months after which I could start again... slowly, ever so slowly... 

If you by "effective training" mean run faster, then I would concentrate on interval training based on Jack Daniels work (also on Wikipedia). You can find a page that will help you with all the relevant numbers here. E.g. if you run 7:15 per mile, then you should consider training intervals where you run 400m in 1:55 then jog 1 minutes and repeat this 4-6 times. That should improve your running speed pretty drastically over 4-6 weeks. EDIT: For the last couple of months I have also use 10-20-30 two times a week with really good results - I have cut 10-15 seconds on my km-time! The concept is very easy and can be used by everybody - and contrary to Jack Daniels method, you don't need to look up target speeds before you start... And it is just two times 30 minutes per week. After which I'm soaked... From the article from the University of Copenhagen:
