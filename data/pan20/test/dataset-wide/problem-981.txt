Firstly you need to define what you mean by average daily temperature. What algorithm are you going to use to compute it (from several time spaced measurements), why and what do you think the result represents. Obviously if you use a measurement which is going to be affected by very local anthropogenic activity (e.g. cars) you can expect timing of activities to affect individual measurements. a measuring station which is going to be thus affected is not really going to be useful for anything wider or general though. When siting weather stations we try to find locations which are not subject to such local disturbances. Ideally well away from any heat producing apparatus (e.g. fixed a/c units), heated buildings, variable traffic and so on. Locations in open non urban areas are preferable for understanding changes in the weather and climate. Past locations thus chosen however have often been compromised by the expansion of nearby housing or industry as populations and cities have expanded. This is why you sometimes see references to Urban Heat Islands (UHI) in discussions of climate measurement. 

It is a quartz crystal artificially coated in thin layer of metal called aura quartz or rainbow quartz. They come in various colours and often can be found in new age shops. More information on the topic can be found on wiki: $URL$ 

Three layered ones look like either sandstone or limestone with a bit of iron oxides. You can put several droplets of acid and check if they fizz. If they do, that is limestone, but I have seen limestone in that colour only once and think that is more likely to be sandstone. 

All of this is wrong on so many levels. Volcanoes are a very small contributor of CO2 and they make it colder on average, not warmer. 

The Karoo ice age period is associated with a drop in CO2 and an increase in O2 (Source) That probably long and rambling and needs more than a little clean-up and I invite counterpoints, but I think that's the gist of estimating when ice ages will end. A precise answer isn't possible. 

That's 100% correct. If we assume constant solar input, there's only two ways the Earth's surface temperature can change. Albedo and Thermal radiation. Greenhouse gas driven climate change means exactly what you said - less heat radiates off Earth into space. Most of this heat goes into the Ocean. 

Quarz veins come in different sizes - starting from milimetre scale ending with several meters (if not more). Quartz veins form from aqueous solution and in most cases that is associated with high hydraulic pressure (be that because of deformation or volcanic fluids). It is highly unlikely that you could identify veins from satelite images because of their size and vegetation. On the other hand that might be possible using drone photos. I suggest looking at Cabo de Gata (cape of agate) satelite images as an example of volcanic region with plenty of silica veins and very little of vegetation. The veins there usually smaller than 1 meter so I don't expect you to see them but you can see some cracks in the rock, which occasionally are refiled with silica (coordinates 36째46'57.3"N 2째06'02.8"W) (source: I did mapping there) 

Absolutely, 100%, unquestionably yes. This is accepted, measured, confirmed and can be modeled and explained. It's 100% accepted science. Even the ancients were able to observe this with careful measurement, though they couldn't accurately explain it. 

In my opinion, there's 3 primary factors. There's a difference between ice ages and ice age periods. The Milankovich cycles appear to play a key role in the forming and receding of individual ice ages, but what it doesn't appear to do is trigger ice age periods. The modern Quaternary ice age period began about 2.58 million years ago. Milankovich cycles likely began long before then, so it's unlikely that Milankovich cycles triggered the period, only that they play a role in the cycle within the period. Same is likely true for solar maximums and minimums. They come and go, but they aren't likely the drivers of ice age periods. Timeline of glaciation the Quaternary, the Karoo and the Andean-Saharan ice ages all happened in the last 450 million years, and they were separated by long periods so the cause should be looked at more long term. Milankovich cycles operate on 26,000, 42,000 and 100,000 timelines, much to short to drive changes over millions of years. OK - the 3 things. Land and ocean placement, Solar output (long term, not short term sunspot changes), and CO2 Land and Ocean Placement One thing that seems necessary for ice age periods is a large land mass over one or both of the poles. The reason for this is pretty straight forward, land gives ice a place to grow and as land ice grows into a glacier, Albedo increases and oceans drop. High altitude over the glacier tends to blow cold air and maintain the glacier. Also as oceans cool, oceans can hold more CO2, dropping atmospheric CO2 and reducing the greenhouse effect. These feedback loops tend to make ice ages colder and they are only possible with land over one or both of the poles. Antarctica drifted over the South Pole and began forming a glacier about 30 million years ago and, in maybe 15-25 million years, it will drift off the the south pole and begin to melt. I think, once Antarctica drifts into warmer waters, ice ages are likely to stop. 15 million years or so? Maybe more? It's also possible that Canada or Russia drift over the North Pole and as the the giant Antarctic Glacier is replaced by a giant Arctic Glacier, but I think the general consensus is that we can expect ice ages to stop when antarctic drifts over warmer water. We can also expect higher sea level too, lower Albedo and no more ice age cycle. Solar output - long term, not short term sunspot cycles. The sun growing more luminous, meaning, more energy for Earth, it's expected to grow warmer by about 10% over the next billion years - roughly 1% every 100 million years. (Source). 1% might not sound like much but it actually is. Solar variation, which is believed to have caused the Mini ice age, has a variation of about 1 - 1.5 watts per square meter. (Source) A 1% more luminous sun would be in the range of 13-14 watts per square meter, so as the sun grows brighter, and if everything else stays the same, certainly within 100-200 million years, the sun would be sufficiently hot to make ice ages pretty darn unlikely. This site suggests that a 10% increase in solar luminosity could result in 47 째C, 116 째F. It will take quite a bit less than that to end ice ages. (Source) We also have to consider orbital drift. If the Earth is slowly moving away from the sun, that's a factor too, and by this study, it is moving away, at 15 CM per year (Source), so, in 100 million years, 150,000 km, 0.1% further from the sun, about 0.2% less solar irradiance, which is only 20% of the increase in solar output,so this, at least by current estimates, will be overshadowed by the sun growing brighter. (Source) Carbon Sequestering / atmospheric CO2 PPM Finally, and very difficult to predict over the long term is carbon sequestering. CO2 has generally been decreasing over millions of years and the drop in CO2 may have played a role in the current ice age cycle. It's entirely possible, though some might disagree, but it's certainly possible that our current uptick in CO2 by human activity has already knocked the next ice age off it's feet and we might have changed the planet enough to end the ice age cycle. The orbital forcing is believed to be only about 1 degree C but ice ages can be about 10 degrees C colder due to feedback mechanisms. Our man made increase in CO2 is expected to warm the earth more than that, so at current CO2 levels, it's entirely possible that an ice-age couldn't form. source quote: 

That looks like a pebble of sandstone with some iron oxide (red layer). Other option is limestone and you can test it with acid if it fizzes. 

Quick googling shows that Cherokee county is dominated by metamorphic rocks. The rock looks like mica schist. The roundish minerals look like garnets but I am not sure about traces of elongated ones - might be kyanite or staurolite (or something more exotic), cannot tell from this photo. 

The parallel layers suggest that it is a rainbow obsidian. Obsidian (aka volcanic glass) forms when molten rock material cools so rapidly that atoms are unable to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure. The rainbow is created by light reflecting from minute inclusions of mineral crystals, rock debris, or gas. The stone is semi-precious, I remember paying several quids for an unpolished piece. 

If we ignore the giant impact (which would have enormous effects), and just look at the effect of the Earth having a 0 degree axial tilt, the most immediately apparent effect is that the seasons would be reduced almost to nothing and the very small seasons that remain would be planet wide, not alternating between the 2 hemispheres. The Earth is currently closest to the sun in the first week of January and furthest in the first week of July. Source, so it's pretty obvious that being closer to the sun doesn't create summer. The axial tilt is what causes the seasons, but the change in distance to the sun still has some effect. There's a little over 3% variation in distance, see source, yielding a bit over 9% variation in energy received between the Earth's perihelion and aphelion, but that doesn't mean a 9% change in temperature. It's much smaller than that due to the Earth's oceans, atmosphere and to a lesser extent, surface are all heat sinks that take a long time to warm up or cool down. The seasonal difference in temperature would be much less than that. Maybe a few degrees, perhaps 5-10 degree difference between summer and winter, probably less than the change between night and day. No tilt also means, you lose the 6 months of sunlight, 6 months of darkness that we currently get near the poles and the sun wouldn't be higher in the sky in summer than in winter. At the poles, you'd effectively get sunset, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year but over most of the Earth you'd have 12 hours (and a few minutes) of sunlight and nearly 12 hours of, not darkness, cause you'd still have twilight and dawn, but over the most of the planet, it would be 12 hour days pretty much. The poles would receive less solar energy and could be colder and there wouldn't be a spring thaw or summer growth. Plant Growth would be pretty consistent all year around. The equator would have more peak sun and could be hotter. With our current tilt, the pole to equator solar energy ratio is 0.4 to 1. Source. With no tilt, it would be 0 to 1. The poles could see an increase in permanent ice. But, despite that increase in ice, you'd get a decrease in solar-ice-reflection, so that could mean a warmer earth, even with more ice on both poles. The equatorial region could be hotter. Circulation is hugely complex, so that's a great big wild-card. Seasonal driven ocean and air currents would be greatly reduced but temperature driven currents should increase, though the reduction of temperature variation is difficult to predict. You still get night to day temperature variation, but the overall effect on wind and ocean currents is too hard for me to predict. Hyper-physics says the tilt is essential to life (linked above). I'm not sure that's true, but no seasons and potentially reduced circulation due to more consistent temperatures could have a pretty big effect. The potentially worst outcome could be a significant still water in the oceans which could create large dead zones. That's by no means a certainty, but it's possible.

Climate science is a very exciting field to get into right now. Not only do we have a change at the top in politics in the USA and the prospect of big changes there but the new theory of a Gravity Induced Temperature Gradient is coming to the fore. I recommend researching and reading about both sides of the debate, not just the CAGW theory stuff. If the ideas of Loschmidt (c.1870's) and the recent experimental results of R.Graeff (2007) take precedence over the current consensus theories then there will be great opportunities opening up in this field for those with the right knowledge and background. Good luck with it ! 

Craters actually can be identified by formation of high-pressure materials such as diamonds or stishovites and coesites (varieties of shocked quartz). A good example of this is the Popigai crater in Russia. Pressures and temperatures at subduction zones are usually too low to form big diamonds but microdiamonds (10-80 microns) were discovered within metamorphic rocks related to continental collisions. There are five well confirmed diamond-bearing terranes, the Kokchetav massif of Kazakhstan, Dabie and Quinlin in China, the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, the Erzgebirge massif of Germany, and the Kimi complex of the Greek Rhodope (according to the paper $URL$ 

Most volcanic eruptions have very little effect. Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 is thought to have cooled the planet for a couple of years, by maybe 1/2 of 1 degree, if that. Mt. Tambora in 1815 was much larger and had a more drastic cooling effect, but only for a few years and only one year was the year without summer. The reason for this is the cooling volcanic gas and particulates, primarily SO2, has a very short half life in the atmosphere. By some estimates, it's half life is as short as a few days, though for larger amounts, because it primarily rains out of the atmosphere, the half life might be longer for big eruptions. Source and Source. (best sources I could find with a quick google search). It's an interesting question as to why Volcanoes are as good at cooling the earth as they are, given that SO2 has a half life of just days, but the answer to this is at least in part, that only very large volcanoes measurably cool the planet, and it might not take that much SO2 to reflect enough sunlight to cool the earth, at least for a month or two, which might be enough to cause a measured drop in temperature for the year, and in extreme cases, a year without summer. But the short answer is that Volcanoes don't heat the Earth, they cool it, and they're not particularly good at cooling it either. Their effect is usually quite temporary. If a Volcano is strong enough to stop man made climate change in it's tracks, it would probably also cover half a continent with ash and significantly hurt our food supply for the year and perhaps, remove most of the ozone layer for a time. The temperature effects would be the least of our problems. (Hopefully, an eruption like that won't happen for several tens of thousands of years, perhaps a few hundred thousand years, but, a gonzo eruption will happen again at some point, probably not in our lifetime though. 

The most common software for creating and modifying maps is ArcGIS (commercial but you can get free trial for a month) or QGIS (open source). 

The glittery part of the rock is mica. Mica is a class of minerals which belongs to sheet silicates. As you can see, crystals form sheets, which forms layers in the rock. Crystals tend to grow perpendicular to highest stress direction during deformation event, so that indicate metamorphism in the past. The presence of micas also indicate the composition of rock - it had to be aluminium rich before it was affected by heat and pressure. It is difficult to tell about the size of crystals but lack of other higher grade minerals or deformations suggests it's mica schist.
