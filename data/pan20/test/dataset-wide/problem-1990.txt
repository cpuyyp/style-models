Here is a completely different angle for you to consider. It may be a completely useless suggestion, but could also transform your life. Since you say that your depression is biological, it is possible that it is rooted in a gene defect governing some important metabolic pathway in the body. Many people who have what most would assume is a mental disorder have significant or amazing improvement in their conditions after mitigating for the problems revealed through genetic testing. You can get genetic testing done at a site like 23 and me (sorry, I don't know of genetic testing companies in the UK, but you can research this). Either do just the Ancestry service, then get your genetic data and upload it to a site like Genetic Genie, or do the more expensive Health & Ancestry service (though you can still use Genetic Genie or another provider, there are several). Please research this, though, as it seems their offerings have changed since I last researched it thoroughly, and you want to be sure that you'll get what you expect. Based on the prices, you may need to do the Health & Ancestry service in either case. For example, a woman with inherited anxiety of disabling and destructive degree, who was completely unhelped by therapy, found through genetic testing that she had an (inherited) double MTHFR gene defect. Under a specialist's care, by avoiding certain foods containing folate and taking a methylfolate supplement, she almost completely resolved her anxiety issues which had plagued her and was destroying her family. Here is an example story—similar, but not identical to the one I read about. Some web searches will reveal lots of talk about this possible connection. It may be a long shot and I know you are short on money for the test and for any special medical care to follow up on the results, but considering how life-changing it could be, how could you not check it out? If you started a GoFundMe site to pay for the genetic testing and any subsequent medical care, I would probably even contribute, myself. To My Detractors I am not advocating the avoidance of honest self-inquiry, nor suggesting skimping on copious amounts of hard work. If there is progress to made through self-improvement efforts such as going to therapy, joining support groups, or reading relevant books, then do all those things! But if there is truly a biological basis for the OP's depression as he has claimed, what reason do you have to doubt him? Are you psychology experts, now, able to diagnose complete strangers after reading a couple of hundred words they wrote? Or is it that you doubt? You don't think that genetic defects in genes governing key metabolic pathways could ever cause depression? Are you all genetics experts, too? Had you ever even heard of MTHFR or COMT? Are you aware of epigenetics—that two people with the same genes can have different genes expressed because of environmental factors? Or that these defects can be more about rates and thresholds than absolute switches, so that an issue can arise later in life after another health problem has stressed the body in some way and put demand on the key pathway? The OP wants to know "How to get a raise I am denied to because of sick leaves." My answer is an objectively realizable path that could achieve his goal. He pays $200 to do genetic testing. He discovers he has a heterozygous defect in a couple of important genes. He visits a doctor familiar with these issues and begins supplementing with vitamins, plus avoiding a few foods. The depression is cut in half in intensity and duration, it becomes easier to manage, he reduces his amount of sick leave by 75%, and is able to get the raise he needs. Or, it doesn't work, or he doesn't have a defect. So then he moves on to another strategy to manage and defeat the problems in his life. If you downvote, please leave a comment with what objective reason you're doing so for—and include your thoughts on genetic defects. If you're just ignorant, go educate yourself before you vote. But if you have objective information that shows my answer to be poor, please share it so that everyone can learn! Don't be afraid I'll revenge doenvote you—I won't. Do be afraid I'll be checking and contesting any objective claims you make that upon investigation appear to be flawed... 

What privacy is violated by using CCTV to check when they entered and exited the building the build or are at their desk or not? Employers do have a right to check up on hours worked and in some country’s not logging OT hours correctly can get the employer fined. What code of conduct for CCTV are you referring to? And its not like you have been asked to look at the content of their email account which would be a privacy violation. You seem concerned about your relationship with other employees is there a culture of falsifying time sheets at your company – what I might term “Spanish” practices. Just get all HR requests in writing and make sure you conform this with your boss. 

If you do want to resist him—I'd think carefully before setting up a big war or making a big insult, especially because these can show you're bothered which is not a good idea—but you could say something along the lines of "[shrug] doesn't it make sense to you that each person uses as big a password as he's capable of remembering?" Then turn away and act like you've dismissed him—get busy with something job-related. If he says something more, say "what, you're still here? Dude, don't you have work you should be doing?" then dismissively turn your back again. Walk away from your desk or involve someone else in conversation, pretending he's not there. Make sure you say everything in as low a tone of voice as possible, that falls at the end instead of rising. Go watch the video The Impact of Tonality and use it! There are many other videos by that same YouTube channel, Charisma Matrix, that could help you. 

For a DB Final Salary Pension you can estimate out what its worth by working out how many qualifying years you have in the scheme and at what rate you accrue (30th 40th or 60th are common) your salary and inflation. Obviously you have to take an average RPI. You can then compare this value to a DC scheme by working out how much you would have to invest to get the same income assuming the same rpi. 

In the UK Employees are entitled to sick pay during any part of their statutory notice period when they are: •“ready and willing” to work even if no work is provided by the employer; •Incapable of work because of sickness or injury; •Absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy, childbirth, adoption leave, parental leave or paternity leave; or •Absent from work on holiday in accordance with their terms of employment relating to holidays. $URL$ 

I don't see why you can't just put a very bland face on it. It's not a feather in your cap of course, and likely can't be used to promote your skills, but there's no reason it has to be a big hole or even all that mysterious. Select some of the elements of your work that were harmless, and make them the whole job. You had to have done, at least a few times, simple things, or things that can have a good face put on them. You were an office assistant. A driver. You sent faxes. You delivered communications to clients. You were a personal attendant. And so on. The business name can be very bland, too. Something like "Private Construction Company" or "Family Business". You can be honest that it was a family business and they're peculiar about the details of their exact identity not being broadcast. There are many such kinds of operations that are perfectly legitimate. I once worked legitimately for a company for 18 months or so, where half the employees (3 or 4 of them) reported for work daily to the CEO's own apartment, and sat at desks in her living room! Just discuss it in general terms, as honestly as you can, and don't let on that there was anything unusual about it. For someone with as little experience as you, this will not be such a bad thing. 

No culture develops over time and is overwhelmingly derived from the grass roots and the employees that make up the company modified by the culture these employees come from Senior management can attempt to change/modify culture but this is hard and can backfire. Sounds like you have been reading to many MBA case studies by HR professionals trying to make their role seem more important than it is. 

You need to talk to a lawyer or some one who understands TUPE, this can get very technical. If your bonus was contractual you should still have it - was this not covered during the consolation process. 

Use examples from your work experience where you have had to investigate a new technology or technique. E.g. the initial proof of concept was to slow for production so I investigated the possible solutions and taught my self node.js and rebuilt the system using that. 

This suggests, find some friends who think the guy is a jerk and can commiserate with you about it. You'll feel supported, won't be as bothered by him, and this alone will make him want to do it less. 

Giving the "out" of the intern saying "oh, yeah, I meant no disrespect" lets him save face and repair the relationship in the most painless way possible. There is no need to extract a confession that he did mean it disrespectfully or to garner some huge apology. The point here is not power-over but successful internship. If after all this, the negative behavior continues, you can address it more head-on. There is no reason you can't give a performance goal to an intern just like you would to a problem employee, or use any other strategy you would use with a regular employee. But remember that the interns are NOT experienced in the work world and should be given a break or two while you gently, but firmly, accustom them to the standards of the professional work world. 

NO use ms word its the defecto industry standard and you want to create as little reason for HR to drop your CV as possible. A second reason unless you have access to acrobat/tools to properly create the pdf you run the risk of having a poor looking pdf 

In the UK the norm is to pro rata the holiday through the leave year if you take 50% of your holiday and leave 25% of the way though the year you do owe them its normally deducted from your last pay cheque. You may be limited in how much leave you can carry over. You need to say when you leave year starts. 

Prepare a proper agenda and send that with a printed document which covers all the changes that they need to be aware of from the Wiki. Doc should be a summary with links to the Wiki. But you would have to have a senior manager propose and champion this.
