The three questions you list -- "what is the purpose of life?", "do we have free will?", "do good and evil exists?" -- are ones many people have strong feelings about, and likely they do not all agree with one another. But common sense is generally understood to mean something like "sound and prudent judgement based on a simple perception of the situation or facts" (Merriam Webster). I.e., a piece of common sense is something which is obvious to anyone and which no reasonable ("sound and prudent") person would disagree with. This is important because it means common sense things are generally not contentious; they are obvious based on "a simple perception of the situation or facts". Citing common sense normatively means pointing out the obvious to someone, often simply by reminding them. For example, if you are in a cabin in the woods at night during a freezing cold winter, common sense dictates the door should not be left open. No one in the cabin is going to take issue with that -- unless there is another common sense factor that supplants it, for example, that the cabin has filled with smoke. So questions which have common sense answers are generally not topics for philosophy, although the concept of "common sense" might be (e.g, contemplating how people come to recognize common sense). There are some grey areas, however: 

This alone may seem potentially anthropological -- it says "concepts of", and anyone might study someone else's "concept of" something without accepting it and contribute to a body of knowledge surrounding that conceptualization. However, while theology may involve examinations of false conceptualizations of God, the ground of such analysis is the true things that can be said about God, and contributing to the body of knowledge requires either applying an explicit and existing set of truths about the divine or an adaption or elaboration of a set of truths about the divine. That's not an anthropological approach, which would not depend on either the truth or falsity of the divine and simply would be an examination of a belief about it. While an atheist could study theology along (e.g) anthropological lines, there is not anything a specifically atheist perspective could sincerely contribute to the body of knowledge; this does not mean the individual atheist could not contribute, only that their contribution could not be something that could only be made by an atheist. Atheism weakly defined is a non-belief in God and the divine; more strongly defined (aka. "antitheism") it's a denial that God and the divine exist.1 Either way, there is nothing to know about and therefore no legitimate body of knowledge to consider and no possibility of making legitimate contributions to it. 

1. Ruling out essentially figurative uses such as, "Guns and tequila are my religion!", although someone might come up with a coherent metaphysical order to justify that (in which case all they'd need would be adherents and presto, religion). There might also be people who'd claim there are some non-metaphysical Eastern religions but I'll hedge that as very dubious. 

This is not true; some facts about existence could be said to be non-temporal even if they are not certain. For example, that 1 + 1 = 2 is a belief, but if it were true, then it does not depend on a thinking subject, or time, to be so. Time is meaningful only in terms of relation, which is erased by the solipsitic challenge. A solipsistic subject might pragmatically deploy the concept of time (and "existence") in self-reflection, but this does not make it otherwise real. 

If transgender people clearly constituted a protected class under U.S. law, then this would be cut and dried -- but of course this is not the case. Presumably over time they could become such, but it would require either executive fiat or else a consistent string of judicial precedents (and conversely, the chances of them ever becoming such could be dispelled by the same processes). That answers the question of why a public funded college might consider itself to be legally exempt and act accordingly. It still does not make them ethically exempt, but presuming their own understanding of ethics accords with their actions, the most feasible argument [advocacy for the devil ->] is a probably a utilitarian one that you have more or less already outlined: For every transgender person made happy by allowing admittance, a disproportionate number of existing students will be made unhappy and feel betrayed in relation to what they feel the college is. So, in the interest of the happiness of the greatest number, it is best to keep transgender people out. This is perhaps implicit in a quote from the aforementioned article: 

The materialist approach is that nothing other than the physical world is required to explain anything, period. It not only does not require a reason for the physical world to exist, it pretty much insists there can be no such thing as a reason for it to exist.1 If you find this problematic, then you have metaphysical aspirations (conscious or unconscious). 

No, because although (i) and (ii) both assert the reality of consciousness, (i) further asserts the reality of something that inexplicably mimics it. So (i) inevitably involves greater complexity; it has multiplied the entities involved with the assertion that there are really existing p-zombies. If so, in addition to explaining consciousness, we need an explanation for "seemingly conscious" persons that are in fact p-zombies. I.e., (i) is the same as (ii) but more elaborate. Of course, if we had uncontroversial evidence for the existence of p-zombies, then (ii) is just false. Not everybody has consciousness, so (i) or some version of it is the only reality. There is a third option, if we can question the existence of consciousness generally: 

1. Note that these laws have long been deemed invalid by U.S. Federal Courts, however, they still mysteriously exist, with occasional minor consequences. Further discussion and references are in the comments. Please also note I am not trying to argue for the "New Atheism" movement but only explain some of its self-justifications, which (for better or worse) often include citing these State laws. 

One problem this exposes is the issue of who or what it is that actually thinks; "I think therefore..." takes as given that it is in fact the I subject which thinks. Yet conjecture could lead us to the conclusion that it might be something else which thinks, and the I is simply an observer of this with itself as the subject. A refinement would be to ditch the the "think" but keep the "I" and "exists", such that the subject is proof of existence. So there are two unquestionable things, the subject, and existence. This implies it might be possible for there to be existence, but no subject, in which case existence is the fundamental ground of the subject. Solipsism is a challenge to this, asserting that without the subject there might be no existence, in which case existence and the subject are one and the same. 

If you are going to a university in the English speaking world, enrolling in Philosophy proper usually does mean a concentration in analytic philosophy; this does not mean it is impossible to get a schooling in continental philosophy that way, but that doing so will make you a bit of an outcast and will not get you out of fulfilling the basic requirements of the program which will include formal logic. At the undergraduate level, offerings in things such as Critical Theory are more likely to be relevant in Humanities and Sociology. Most of the foremost thinkers in 20th century continental philosophy came out of places such as the École Normale Supérieure or the Frankurt School; a similar line of study here would be considered interdisciplinary or (again) Humanities, and less easily satisfied by the Philosophy Dept. I'll restate what others have said, however, about being wary of avoiding maths for avoiding maths sake. You do not have to go toe-to-toe discussing calculus with physicists, but if the fundamental reason is you lack confidence in your ability to solve quadratric quations etc., and/or you you think such is not interesting enough to merit your time, you are giving up somewhat on your ability to think about and learn fairly fundamental things. 

1. To clarify, this is not to say there was no reason for the big bang. Almost certainly there was, but it was a physical reason. WRT Occam's razor, that is the simplest option. "Multiplying entities" does not mean increasing the number of something that already exists; a house with five rooms is as likely as a house with two rooms by Occam's razor. It means not adding new kinds of entities that otherwise don't need to exist (e.g., a house with five rooms full of ghosts). From this perspective, multiverse theories are not objectionable because they don't claim there is some new realm that cannot be analyzed in physical terms. They claim there is more than one room in the house. 

Perhaps there is a "map is not the territory" fallacy at play here. That experience can be explained physically does not make the explanation the equivalent of the experience. I would agree, however, that given a sufficient explanation of an experience in neurophysical terms, it may be plausible to replicate the experience: 

If the planet Abracadabra is one some astrophysicists insist exist and others insist do not, people in the latter camp cannot at the same time claim they have something to contribute to the body of knowledge (-ology) about Abracadabra. They might have things to say about the beliefs of those that do insist on its reality, but that is not the same. Hence, there is no definition of theology that would make atheism a meaningful qualifier of it. Starting with wikipedia: 

No, you're misrepresenting the concept of probability. The improbability of our universe is like the improbability of human life -- we happen to be it, there. But just because we notice that the vast majority of the universe, or even just our solar system, does not contain life on the order of human beings, does not mean that human beings should have all kinds of arbitrary absurd characteristics or else clearly something spooky going on. This is like saying because I won the lottery yesterday I should continue to win all week, and if I don't, then it must be because God interfered. Of course, perhaps humans do have all kinds of arbitrary absurd characteristics but we don't notice ;) 

In context, monism is the belief that everything has the same fundamental ground, the material universe (or multiverse, depending on whatever theory-of-everything physical you find most appealing). Everything that is real is physical. Philosophy of mind wise, this contrasts with dualism, which asserts that the mind is a real thing which might have a dependence on something physical, but is really more than the sum of its material parts (this is a point where a distinction between physical and material might be worth consideration). With regard to phenomenon such as pleasure and pain, it is already well established, that, e.g., someone can attach a bunch of electrodes to your head and identify, physically, which parts of your brain (which is material) light up in response to various stimuli. However, this is still not really enough to confirm that the mind is still just a physical entity (like the earth's electromagnetic or gravitational field); to do this we would need a clear chain of causality derived from physical laws, taking us all the way to a definitive description of all the contents of consciousness. A monist materialist would say we simply don't have the science or technology to do that yet, but there is still no reason to believe it is not possible in theory. A dualist would say we never will because the contents of consciousness are apprehendable only in terms of consciousness itself (or perhaps, some special realm of which consciousness is a part). Note that dualism thus depends on something other than the physical to explain the nature and workings of consciousness. This shifts the burden of proof in a very awkward direction, and a monist materialist objection might be that no such realm is necessary and that asserting one prematurely is a violation of Occam's razor; when you unnecessarily multiply the number of entities "required" to explain some phenomenon, you might as well so multiply them any number of times (i.e., this manner of thinking allows you to claim equal validity for anything you want). Getting to the point then, for a monist materialist (e.g., yours truly): 

According to wikipedia, physicalism is now-a-days the preferred term to materialism in order to better include physical phenomenon which might be considered immaterial, e.g., fields or space itself. I'm not sure how important this distinction is, but it does help to emphasize: 

Unlike the ability to make choices, which is obvious from "a simple perception of facts",1 this is not, as you claim, a piece of common sense even if most people agree. Going back to our politician, winning an election with 70% of the vote is an accomplishment, but it does not mean the politician's hyperbole is true. That would be a perverse interpretation of democracy; it implies that if a majority vote that the sky is bright orange at night, then this means the sky is bright orange at night. Obviously a rational majority would not do that, but that is not why it is not true, either. It's not true because this is a matter of common sense, a "simple perception of facts", and not something that can be decided by human beings making choices. Likewise, although settling debates democratically is a laudable social practice, this is not ideally how philosophy works. Philosophical issues are not published as multiple choice questions then distributed to university faculties for their members to vote on. However, there is a democratic factor in so far as in any other academic field, if your peers take you seriously, your philosophical work may flourish, otherwise it likely will not. But the argument that something is false because it is unpopular is not a good one; ideally, we want a rational case for the opposite: that it is unpopular because it is false. This does not free us from making a case about why it is false (again, not because it is unpopular). Framing an issue as a matter of common sense is political rhetoric if the issue is in fact not one which everyone will easily agree upon, and this is exactly what you have done with the issue of free will; despite the fact that almost everyone will agree that for pragmatic purposes we can make choices, many of them will admit that could be a bit of a theoretical distinction for various reasons. So free will is a good topic for philosophy precisely because it turns out to be a bad topic for common sense. To answer your question, then, no, philosophy does not work by tackling common sense questions and "adding complexity but not answering the question more precisely". Truly common sense questions ("Should I leave the door open?") are not really serious topics for philosophy. We might even say that philosophy begins where common sense ends, and this is true to the literal meaning, "love of wisdom or knowledge", if we assert that the "wisdom or knowledge" referred to here is potentially of the uncommon sort.
