If the loan is indexed to inflation, "nothing" would happen. The remaining loan payments would simply increase. If the loan is not indexed to inflation, when inflation occurs, the debtor's wage would most likely increase with the inflation rate. Hence, he would very quickly have the money (in nominal terms) required to pay back the debt (which is now less worth, in real terms). Consider the loan $L$ in monetary terms, and denote the price level by $P$. The lender was expecting $L/P$ when he formulated $L$. Now, instead, he is getting $L/P_2$ in real terms, which is (for the much larger price level $P_2$) a much smaller real value. Which leads us to the conclusion that in this case (and very often), higher inflation is a redistribution from lenders to debtors. 

It's not really introductory in the sense that it focusses on what Macro-Prodential means (reducing risk at the cost of efficiency), but rather applied: Martin and Philippon (2014) analyze the great recession in Europe and simulate to what end more macruprudential policies would have ameliorated the situation. 

Say I have a time series of two variables, $X$ and $Y$, and want to find out which one of these two moves first. One example is the one of GDP growth and investment growth, where we usually tell the story that at a business cycle frequency, investment moves "earlier" than production or consumption. I dont want to do eyeballing econometrics ("this thingy here clearly moved first"). What is the standard way of dealing with these things in the literature? What methodology can be used? Answers that allow for more than two variables are very welcome. 

I'm looking for as many empirical "stylized facts" about price dispersion (in products markets) in the idea of Burdett and Judd (1983) as possible. For example, 

Let's see how questions like the following are taken here. Gali and van Rens, 2014 show that empirically, the correlation between $Y, Y/L$ has been declining over time. In fact, it only was a "real thing" when the RBC theory was formed, and is now not statistically different from zero. Is that an end to RBC theory as we know it? And by RBC I mean anything that sets driven by a TFP shock / uses TFP shocks to explain empirical phenomena: Standard neoclassical models for sure, even Neokeynesian models rely (to a lesser extend) on these. Also the whole Diamonds-Mortensen-Pissarides literature, where the surplus of a match comes from labor productivity, seems to be affected. Alternatively, one could argue that that the correlation has become smaller, but amplification mechanism are larger now. Or attack the measurement of Gali and van Rens (but their results seem to be pretty robust). What are potential views on this, what arguments does the literature emphasize? 

This was all without political economy consideration. There are arguments on optimal spending that take into account how your current budget will affect the budget of future (different) governments. Have a look at Persson and Svensson (1989) to get a feel for this kind of political economy reasoning. Note that the argument in the cited paper would go the wrong way (i.e., too much spending of a conservative government), but it shows you how optimal policies under a permanent ruler can differ from optimal policies in a democracy. 

(emphasis mine). In contrast, they find that the elasticity of earnings (food sector) w.r.t. the minimum wages is consistently around $0.2$ for many different specifications. 

Believe in Coordination If all these fail... make the government powerful. Kaplan and Menzio (2015) model unemployment, and can get two steady states given their calibration. They take the lower unemployment level as the "reasonable" steady state, that they use to calibrate parameters against. I don't think they spell it out, but the argument most likely is that if there are two steady states, a powerful government could steer the economy to the steady state implying the highest welfare. This is basically your "highest value" point - but it should be clear that there is some reason why that is achieved. That's why I said "it depends a lot on the context" - many coordination failure models hinge critically on the assumption that no higher power can steer the economy. See also the Chicken Economy model, a term I believe originally to be coined in Minnesota. Sunspots Finally, if all else fails, sun spots are what determine which equilibrium you are in. In economics, we mean by that basically a random exogenous variable, something not modeled. They're very disputed as they have no economic meaning and are hard to digest. Basically, if there was anything that had economic meaning and could determine the equilibrium, you would rather put it into your model than having a coin flip determine it. See also Karl Shell's summary on the subject for The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics. 

This was supposed to be a comment to @rumtscho, but it turns out to be too long, and then I kept adding information, so perhaps this deserves to be its own answer Is an increase in mobility really detrimental for efficiency? Imagine a world with non-mobile capital and labor. Now we increase mobility of capital (but not labor). Now @rumtscho argues, this would decrease employment. In general, the opposite should happen: A decrease in rigidity increases efficiency (in almost any model I am aware of), and hence the utilization of previously unused resources. Intuition Intuitively, imagine some people being unemployed in region XYZ, because they are stuck in a region with labor but no capital. With mobility of capital, capital will move towards that region (because unused labor promises higher returns to capital). General Case Technically, the change over time of the unemployment rate $u(t)$ can be denoted as $$ \dot u(t) = s(t)(1-u(t)) + u(t)e(t)$$ where $s(t)$ is the rate of separations, and $e(t)$ is the rate at which unemployed find employment. Now, technology can affect both $s(t)$ and $e(t)$. I have brought forward reasons why $e(t)$ may increase, and @rumtscho has brought forward reasons for why $s(t)$ can increase. Conclusion The overall outcome is unknown. Anecdotal evidence and intuitive hand-waiving arguments have betrayed the economic profession quite often. To answer the question at hands, we need real data. Of which I, unfortunately, am not aware of. 

The total number of matched applications is $$\sum_{x=1}^\infty g(x)xv = E[x]v$$ The number of applications matched with vacancies with $x$-many applications is $$g(x)xv$$ Hence $$Prob(\text{matching with x} | \text{matched} = \frac{g(x)x}{E[x]}$$ Using this in the equation in the question gives $$ \tilde f = a \sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{g(x)x}{E[x]}\frac{1}{x}\\ = E[x]a \sum_{x=1}^\infty g(x) \\ = \frac{v}{u} (1-g(0)) = f $$ 

Let's think about a unit of non-depreciating capital that has a price of $p_k$, in a static environment where we normalized the price of the consumption good to 1. Furthermore, the unit of capital gives you $r$ units of interest in consumption good units. tl;dr: Yes, Because of some equilibrium condition. The value of capital Let me denote by $\lambda_t$ the value of a marginal consumption good in unit $t$ - this is how much more happy you would be today, if you knew that in time $t$ you get to consume a little bit more. Then, the utility that a unit of capital generates for you at time $0$ is $$\lambda_1 r + \lambda_2 r + \lambda_3 r + \dots$$ We assume that capital doesn't give interest in the first period. Note that discount rates are hidden inside $\lambda$; this sequence converges by assumption. This is your discounted real expected return on capital goods. Cost of Capital Now, what is the opportunity cost of investing into one unit of capital? You forgo $p_k$ units of consumption in period 0. Equilibrium Condition The cost has to equal the value in equilibrium - the price has to equal the value of capital, otherwise:
