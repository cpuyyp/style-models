In algebraic topology, there are two slightly different ways of thinking about this: one bundle at a time (the more usual way) and universally (via bundles between classifying spaces). The second approach is surprisingly simple and general, as shown in the very brief paper "A note on the splitting principal", $URL$ #109 on my web page. A key point is to notice that the splitting principle concerns the reduction of the structural group of a pullback of a given (complex) vector bundle from $U(n)$ to its maximal torus $T^n$. Replacing $U(n)$ by other compact Lie groups leads to splitting principals for other kinds of bundles, e.g. symplectic and real with cohomology away from $2$. Replacing $T^n$ by a maximal $2$-torus gives a splitting principal for real bundles and cohomology at $2$. 

The homotopy analogue definition of natural transformations has been known and used regularly since at least the late 1960's, by which time it was understood that the classifying space functor from (small) categories to spaces converts natural transformations to homotopies because it takes the category $I=2$ to the unit interval and preserves products. Composition of natural transformations $H\colon A\times I\to B$ and $J\colon B\times I\to C$ is just the obvious composite starting with $id\times \Delta: A\times I \to A\times I\times I$, just as in topology. (I've been teaching that for at least several decades, and I'm sure I'm not the only one.) 

Since Denis gave the right reference, namely $URL$ I did not follow up and answer this question. We can work with any compact Lie group and any complete universe. Working in the equivariant stable category always, with $S = S^0$, $S^{-n}$ a negative sphere $G$-spectrum and $S^0$ and $S^n$ sphere spaces with trivial $G$-action, $$ \pi_{-n}(S) = [S^{-n},S]_G = [S,\Sigma^{\infty} S^n]_G = [S^0, QS^n]_G = 0 $$ where $Q^G$ is the functor $(colim_V \Omega^V \Sigma^V(-))^G$, with $V$ running through representations of $G$; $Q^G(X)$ is an $(n-1)$-connected $G$-space if $X$ is so. Replacing $S$ by $\Sigma^{\infty} G/H_+$, the same argument works, using change of groups so that one is now looking at $[-,-]_H$. More generally, the negative homotopy groups of the suspension $G$-spectrum of any $G$-space are zero, and the non-negative groups are calculated by the tom Dieck splitting theorem. 

Hi Greg, I'll give an alternative, elementary, starting point towards an answer. Dylan, there is a question about using the bar construction that seems maybe to be missing from your answer, and I don't understand your statements about dealing with multiplicative structure or with uniqueness. Also, if you will forgive a little teasing, if your favorite tool is a sledgehammer, then every nail looks like a rock. I'll use the two-sided bar construction from "The geometry of iterated loop spaces", [12] on my web page; see [112] for a modernized discussion and some category theory relevant to the question. For a $T$-algebra $A$, define a $T'$-algebra $F(A)$ by $F(A) = R'B(L,T,A)$, where $T$ acts on the right of $L$ via $\epsilon R$. This is a $T'$-algebra since $R'D$ is a $T'$-algebra for any $D\in \mathcal D$. Similarly, For a $T'$-algebra $A'$, define a $T$-algebra $G(A')$ by $G(A') = RB(L',T',A')$. Of course, $F$ and $G$ are functors. I assume that we have natural weak equivalences $$\gamma'\colon B(R'L, T, A) \to R'B(L,T,A)$$ and $$ \gamma\colon B(RL', T', A') \to RB(L',T',A').$$ We expect the second to come from a weak equivalence of the general form $|RX|\to R|X|$ for a simplicial object $X\in \mathcal C$, and similarly for the first. With $R = \Omega$ and $\mathcal C$ the category of based spaces, proving that there is such a weak equivalence $\gamma$ was the hardest thing technically in [12]. It is something like this that I find missing in your sketch, Dylan, but if we can see directly that $B(R'L, T, A)$ is a $T'$-algebra (say by commuting $T'$ past $B$) and similarly for $B(RL',T',A')$, then perhaps that is not needed here. Since $T = RL$, we have the chain of natural weak equivalences (ignoring algebra structure) $$ A \leftarrow B(T,T,A) \leftarrow B(R'L,T,A) \to F(A) $$ where the middle arrow is induced by $\alpha\colon R'\to R$, which I'll assume given (rather than taking a conjugate). Similarly, we have the chain of weak equivalences $$ A' \leftarrow B(T',T',A') \rightarrow B(RL',T',A') \to G(A'). $$ Therefore $F(G(A'))\simeq A'$ and $G(F(A))\simeq A$. It remains to prove that these equivalences (or related ones) are equivalences of $T'$-algebras and $T$-algebras. I haven't had time to try. 

The geometric fixed point construction can easily be described in terms of constructions present in any good model for the equivariant stable category. For notational simplicity, I'll restrict to the case $H = G$. In general, one can first apply the change of groups functor from $G$-spectra to $H$-spectra and then apply the geometric $H$-fixed point functor. Let $\mathcal P$ be the family of proper subgroups of $G$. There is a classifying $G$-space $E\mathcal P$, and we let $\tilde E \mathcal{P}$ denote the cofiber of the evident based $G$-map $E\mathcal{P}_+ \to S^0$. Any good model is tensored over $G$-spaces, so for any $G$-spectrum $X$, we have the $G$-spectrum $X\wedge \tilde E \mathcal{P}$. Its categorical $G$-fixed point spectrum is the geometric fixed point spectrum of $X$. (This is pointed out briefly in Section XVI.3 of Equivariant Homotopy and Cohomology Theory. I've ignored model theoretic niceties for clarity.) Edit: In the context of orthogonal $G$-spectra, Mandell and I gave a reasonably comprehensive treatment in Section 4 of Chapter V of ``Equivariant orthogonal $G$-spectra and $S$-modules'', all in a more general framework of normal subgroups and quotient groups. We give several definitions and comparisons (see Lemma 4.15 and Proposition 4.17, including the context-free one I described above). The functor preserves cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations by Proposition 4.5, but I see no reason to think it is a left adjoint: I described it in the first place as a composite of a left and a right adjoint. The monoidal property is Proposition 4.7, and the compatibility with space-level fixed points is Corollary 4.6. The Whitehead theorem is not there, but is a comparison with the usual criterion in terms of "categorical" fixed points (aka Lewis-May fixed points) by the implicit isotropy separation cofibration and induction. The term "categorical" refers to the fact that this fixed point functor is right adjoint to the functor from nonequivariant orthogonal spectra, viewed as $G$-trivial naive $G$-spectra, to genuine $G$-spectra obtained by change of universe. You first change to the trivial universe and then take level wise fixed points. 

I have no idea whose paper the question refers to, but I can say what standard naive practice dictates. For any map $f\colon X\to Y$ of based spaces or spectra, there is a canonical cofiber $i\colon Y\to Cf$, where $Cf = Y\cup_f CX$. Here $CX$ is the (reduced) cone $X\wedge I$, where $I$ has basepoint $1$. Thus $Cf$ is the pushout of $f$ and the inclusion $i_0\colon X\to CX$. That is the space (or spectrum, being sloppy about the distinction between fiber and cofiber sequences there) that a working mathematician has in mind for your $Z_f$. However, I emphasize that this is not just a canonical space but a canonical map. For a map $g\colon Y \to Z$, the resulting sequence of maps $X \to Y \to Z$ is said to be a cofiber sequence if there is an equivalence to the sequence $X \to Y \to Cf$. If we require a map of sequences giving the equivalence to be the identity on $X$ and $Y$, then it is given by a map $h\colon Z\to Cf$ such that $h\circ g = i$. Then $h$ is given by a null homotopy of $g\circ f$, and that may be the "preferred" null homotopy your author has in mind. This is analogous to algebra, where a cokernel of a homomorphism of groups is not a group but a homomorphism of groups. The analogy becomes precise if one works with chain complexes instead of groups. 

Well, there is an eponymous spectral sequence in my thesis (still never published in full, but there is an announcement, stuff about it in Ravenel's book, and papers by Tangora and others). Quite generally, take a connected graded algebra $A$ over a field $k$, filter it for example by the powers of its augmentation ideal $IA$ (the elements of positive degree). Then the associated graded algebra $E^0A$ is bigraded. The filtration leads to a spectral sequence that converges from $Ext_{E^0A}(k,k)$ to $Ext_A(k,k)$. There is a homological grading and a bigrading from $E^0A$ that give a trigrading. Incidentally, in the opposite direction, Bockstein spectral sequences of spaces are monograded. 

That is a very reasonable question. By a $G$-spectrum $KU_G$, $G$ a compact Lie group, one should mean a genuine $G$_spectrum, so suitably indexed on representations of $G$. One gets the structure maps by use of equivariant Bott periodicity. A good sketch of how this goes, without full details, is given on pages 146-148 of Equivariant Homotopy and Cohomology Theory (available here: $URL$ The relevant chapter was written by John Greenlees. 

Jacobo, I don't know where to put answers to questions asked after answers, and I don't have much of an answer. I do know how to manufacture the localization of $BSF$ at a prime $p$ out of symmetric groups (a multiplicative version of Barratt-Priddy-Quillen), also in the old $E_{\infty}$ ring book. However, I think by geometric you mean algebro-geometric, interpreting Quillen's relationship with formal groups that way. For sure I know nothing along those lines and don't expect anything.
