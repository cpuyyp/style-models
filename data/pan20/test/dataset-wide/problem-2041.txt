Let's start with a simple question: Is this about promotion? You mentioned cut-throat promotions right after this passage: 

Talk to manager about your doubts - ask why is he fired, honestly tell you don't see the reason. Protest his firing, if you strongly feel it's unjust. Ask for better conditions for him. Him having someone having his back speaks well of him, even if he is incompetent. You may give the manager a pause, a cause to rethink. If he pauses and then still goes with "fire him", then you know decision has serious reason and was made already. If the amount of work he was given seems unreasonable, verify that with other people. Ask them if they also think that. Tell to your / his boss that that's a bad move and it makes other people afraid that same will happen to them. Perhaps add "in light of talk about company going for sale people wonder how many staff we are to lose prior to acquisition". This is something that I honestly am hesitant to add, may hurt you and others if played wrong. Get your colleague to profess what he wants. You should know if he wants to stay or not. BEWARE! People almost always say they want to stay, while few months later, in new job, they almost always say they are better where they are now and staying would have been a bad move. How much of it is rationalizing and how much is truth, you may never know. In my cases they really seemed happier. Carefully weigh in that if you succeed and he stays, this will cause stress. He went through "termination warning" and had Damocles' sword above his neck. It's not gonna go away like that. So, your help doesn't stop on "him NOT getting fired". Consider it likely you'll end up diffusing several situations later on, where he (or management) over-interprets some words, actions. It's a large responsibility. 

This is exactly why I wouldn't say anything. It's never good to complain about a job no matter how bad it was at times and instead you should only leave with the positives. If you really wanted to say something to those that recommended you just keep it brief. Something similar to: 

Of course it is but only if you move to a job that is going to enhance you in some way. My first proper job I loved. I was straight out of my apprenticeship and I did mostly IT networking/support. I then started to get interested in programming and started to learn this on the job. The job itself however wasn't focused in a way for me to build my skills further so I had to make a move. I'd been here six years and I was young so moving jobs was daunting. That move was almost certainly the best move I made in the long term. Not only did I learn new skills in doing so I then found another job more suited to my skills. As an added bonus, on each move I also negotiated my salary. This in itself helps in the long term as you'll want more money to buy all those nice things, as well as affording all those expensive bills that will certainly come along at some point. I'm now in a job that I again love, I'm comfortable in and can happily support my family. So not only did it benefit me, it benefited my family (long before I knew it would). With all that said it certainly comes down to you as an individual. Think to yourself, what can I now get out of my job? if the answer is very little then it may be time to make that move. Either way, good luck. 

That might serve as one of the reasons why you shouldn't try to be indispensable for any certain position at work 

That is so so so soooo wrong! Answering a professional question that you have no clue about, without doing any research, is actually the unprofessional thing to do here. Telling someone I will research on this and get back to you is one of the most appropriate responses you can have. If I was the interviewer or even your boss and I was certain that what I asked is not everyday knowledge that you should already know, I would be pleased with your response. 

Set the alarm after the regular office time is over. Everyone who stays in office after that and has to go out must disable the alarm and then set it again before leaving. Following this protocol will ensure the alarm is always set and there is no guesswork involved whether someone else is still in the building or not. Yes it is a little extra hassle for everyone to do it but it ensures its set always. Neither does it cost you an extra dime nor does it rely on guesswork. 

Advise them that they seem a little under the weather and it would be better for them to get home and have some rest. If they can work remotely then let them work remotely and ensure they are paid for it. They may not even be ill, they could have a seasonal allergy. That being said, in all places I've worked, I've had one that allowed to work remotely and they did it begrudgingly. At my current place we are allowed one day to work from home remotely, the others are unpaid. It's not something that I often see being pushed. Often the employer would say if you're ill then take the time off to recover which is all well and good when you can afford too. Here is the problem. I myself don't get paid to sit at home so if I'm capable of getting my two sons ready for school/nursery and I'm not bedridden, I'm going to work. I myself don't like to do this but I'm not in a position to lose a days wage when I have my mortgage/bills to pay and 2 young ones to feed. I understand that people don't want ill people to come into work and spread germs but chances are you're going to catch the cold anyway even if that person is at home. People can be carriers of an illness and not show any signs of having it so if one of those people is in the office you're still open to catching it. Obviously if you are really ill or have a really contagious disease then yes the right thing to do is take the day off. I wouldn't come into work with smallpox for example. I don't like sniffing. It bugs me never mind the person who has to listen to this. Personally I have head phones. Being a developer I often wear these to drown out noise anyway. Get a pair and listen to the radio from your PC. Alternatively move to another location with a bit less noise. 

So, assuming it's (perhaps!) not just that junior who has this misconception; assuming your fears are about your promotion (will my boss think like this junior? will my other colleague fighting with me over promotion will tell the boss that I keep needing help in my tasks?); assuming you still want to ask for help (for reasons you do it now)... 

Monitor yourself. Set simple rules when you would ask, when you won't. Keep priorities of the job in mind when asking or asked for help. Weigh in how often you ask / are asked, how much time you / others spend on helping. Compare it to your rivals if you're worried about them overtaking you. Do your due for problems before you ask for solutions / help. Phrase your questions so other know it. Double-check that it's not an easy question, perhaps test how much your peers would take to solve it. Don't mind the junior, his comment may come from simple excitement, that this mighty senior, whom he has enshrined, has things he doesn't know and perhaps can be reached in time. 

Personally I don't think you need to take this any further with anyone. You made it clear to the company you were working for why you are leaving and that should be enough. Only if the people that recommended you approach you would I say anything. 

They would be and should be expected to take time off as a holiday or as unpaid. Unless they are the owner of the business they are more than likely under the same polices given to every employee. Should the company decide that it's OK for this manager to attend a funeral and be paid to do so then other managers would expect the same. It's setting the wrong precedent. In my opinion if the manager wants to attend the funeral I'm sure they would do so by taking it as a holiday or unpaid leave. It's a small sacrifice to be there for your friend. This might be completely different had it been the employee who died. The company may then take a different approach to handle that. I currently live in the England so France may differ 

Listen to this guy. 10 years from now on you will be thinking fondly of his advice and will be regretting not paying heed. In the present you are fresh, energetic, eager to work as fast as you can but slowly you will tend to find less energy to keep up the pace over the years. There will be a day you will start thinking I can take it a little easy I don't have to do everything yesterday but by that time you would already have gained reputation for getting things done yesterday and you will have to keep the pace up even when you don't feel up to it. I don't know or care about the motives of this person for telling you to slow down, but the advice itself is very good. Send me back 15 years I would take it. 

Andy's picture that you have painted clearly makes me believe that if Andy had heard that conversation, you would not be sitting here guessing whether he did. You would have received a call back right there. So, don't worry :) And that is the recommended practice at least in our culture, cross the bridge when it arrives. 

You may want to alter the wording but I really would keep it brief. There's no need to go into a lot of detail. 

At my first job I asked for a salary increase and they dismissed it saying that my salary was competitive with the current market in the area. I was however asked to have a look around myself to ensure this fact was correct. I was young and so asked what they meant by that and simply put they suggested looking on job websites and comparing the salary provided for the same role advertised in the same area. It was competitive according to that but I still felt underpaid for what I did and for my potential. I moved on and gained an increase in my salary in a slightly different role. As time went on I still felt I wasn't being paid enough and no I wasn't being greedy. As you get older, life gets more expensive; children, mortgage, bills etc. I asked for a salary increase and again was refused as it was competitive. I was lucky however and had a recruiter contact me for a local job. I took it. It was a £10k pay rise putting me apparently £15k more expensive than the going rate in the area. It's not really, it's fair. Before leaving my employer wanted to see if they could match. When I told them the offer they nearly fell off their seat. They couldn't believe the wage I was being offered and were in no way prepared to match it. I now feel I'm getting the wage I deserve for the job I'm doing in the area I'm in. If you want to write to a letter, you'll have to show your research. The best research will be job sites which are offering the same job in the same area. This will give you a good indication of what you can ask for at your current job. TL:DR your best bet is to move jobs. This I've found is the easiest way to get a pay increase.
