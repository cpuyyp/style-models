Let $X$ be any non-constant random variable. Then the covariance between $X$ and $2X$ is not zero. Therefore it is false that all random variables have zero covaraince. Therefore the statement 

You say you went from two cups of coffee to the Peano axioms to the natural numbers. This is, first of all, an extremely strange progression. Most of us became pretty familiar with the natural numbers long before we'd ever heard of the Peano axioms. Fermat, Pascal and Euler managed to discover a great many deep truths about the natural numbers and never learned about the Peano axioms. So if this is really an accurate account of your experience, then your experience is so much at odds with anyone else's that I'm not sure any of us can have much insight into what is and is not possible in your mental universe. Next, note that just as there's far more to the Peano axioms than there is to the distinction between one and two cups of coffee, there's far more to the natural numbers than there is to the Peano axioms --- as is evident, for example, from the fact that the Peano axioms have (first-order) non-standard models, and so cannot fully describe the properties of the natural numbers. I know (from Frey/Ribet/Wiles) that the natural numbers satisfy Fermat's Last Theorem. I do not know whether Fermat's Last Theorem follows from the Peano axioms. Because the natural numbers transcend what you can learn from the Peano axioms (and way transcend what you can learn from counting your --- presumably finitely many --- coffee cups) I do not see what would lead you to imagine that they're ultimately based on either of these things, or on anything physical. It seems clear to me that the primeness of the number 17 is not a physical fact. You could (just barely) argue otherwise, saying that it's a physical fact that there's no way to arrange 17 stones into more than one equally sized pile. But what about the fact that there are infinitely many primes? On what physical observation do you imagine that to rest? 

Nobody can know what Rand or Nozick would have said, but here is what they should have said: Suppose the medicine costs, say, $100, and that a healthy infant has a 1% chance of someday needing it. Then as long as there are functioning markets, one can insure against needing the medicine at a price of about $1 (maybe a bit more to cover administrative costs; the exact number doesn't matter). The family, by virtue of choosing not to buy that insurance when the infant was healthy, revealed that they preferred a dollar to having the insurance. If it's okay for the state to force old men to provide that insurance, then surely it's even better to force old men to give young families a dollar. That, after all, is what the young families seem to prefer. So what's at issue here is not the rights/freedom/dignity of old men with medicine; it's the rights/freedom/dignity of young families with children. If we respect those family's choices, then we might or might not lobby for old men to give them money, but we surely won't lobby for old men to give them insurance that they value less. 

I. It would be a very odd thing indeed if the truth/falsity/neither of a statement about, say, arithmetic could depend on a bunch of more-or-less-arbitrary axioms invented by human beings in the twentieth century. This suggests, for example, that Gauss, who had never heard of ZFC, would have had no way of knowing that the statement "2+2=4" is true, and in fact would not have been able to formulate a correct definition of what it would mean for that statement to be true. II. A given mathematical statement can have more than one formalization in ZFC, and it's possible for one of these formalizations to be decideable and the other not. On your account, do such statements have truth values? III. It is, in any event, unclear what you're suggestion. Which of the following comes closest? Version 1: Decideability in ZFC causes statements to have truth values. Version 2: The set of statements that are decideable in ZFC happens to coincide with the set of statements that have truth values. Version 3: Some other thing. IV. You write: "if the rules can not determine the truth value of a statement, then that's it" --- Ah. But the question "Does Theorem A follow from Axioms B, C and D?" is a mathematical question, and you've just allowed that it has an answer. That means, given the rest of your program, that you are assuming that the statement "Theorem A follows from Axioms A, B, and C" is decideable. But we know that there are statements of that form that are not decideable. So I believe you are hoist on your own petard. 

The right "behind the veil" calculation is to ask yourself whether you'd rather be born into a world with capital punishment or a world without --- accounting for the facts that you might be born a murderer, or someone who is falsely convicted of murder, or a murder victim, or someone who is saved from being a murder victim through the deterrent effect of capital punishment, or any of a thousand other possibilities (all, of course, with probabilities reflecting the frequency of these roles in the population). The key element in this calculation is probably going to be the size of the deterrent effect of capital punishment. Most studies have found that effect to be quite large (on the order of eight murders prevented per execution). A few have found it to be much smaller, and a few others have found numbers as high as 24. 

First of all, this is not a question to which there is a right or wrong answer; it's a question about conventions. That said, the standard convention, so far as I'm aware, is that an argument begins with a set of premises and there are no restrictions on that set (except, in a formal setting, for the requirement that it be recursive --- i.e. that we ought to be able to recognize the difference between a premise and a non-premise). You seem to be strangely passionate about an issue of pure convention, but for all your passion you don't seem to be able to produce a single standard reference that requires the set of premises to be non-empty. In fact, if you're doing propositional (as opposed to predicate) logic, it can be convenient to define a tautology as a conclusion that follows from no premises. (Of course you have to be careful about what "follows" means if you're going to do this --- and again, this is a matter of convention, not absolute truth.) If you do feel inspired to pick up a book, I feel sure that any standard logic textbook will do. They tend to specify that an argument starts with a set of premises, and I have never seen any restrictions placed on the cardinality of that set. Disallowing sets with exactly zero premises strikes me as exactly as unnatural as disallowing sets with any odd number of premises. What would be the point? 

If all observers agree that two events happen at the exact same time, then they must happen at the exact same point in spacetime. If they happen at the exact same point in spacetime, they are, by definition, the same event. 

Of course there are important things left out of the mathematical model. Maybe one of the islands is inhabited by bears who will certainly eat anyone who tries to enter. Maybe one of the bridges is incapable of supporting the weight of a human. Maybe there's an eighth bridge that somehow nobody's noticed before. I have a great deal of trouble seeing what the issue is here. No matter what you choose to talk about, it's always possible you've overlooked something important. Once that thing is pointed out, you might or might not be perfectly happy to continue ignoring it. That's why we generally like to run our arguments past other people --- because sometimes they notice things we haven't noticed. Your question seems to be: "How can we be 100% certain of never overlooking anything we might care about?". The answer is that we can't, and the counter-question is "Why ever would you have thought that we could?" Edited to add: In the particular case of the Konigsberg bridges, I am sure that Euler would have been perfectly happy to go right on ignoring the bears or the collapsible bridge, because he was never terribly interested in traversing the islands in the first place --- instead he was interested in the mathematical problem the islands inspired, and that problem would have remained interesting with or without its "real-world" counterpart. 

A paradox (in this context) consists of two theorems that contradict each other. Russell's paradox, for example, consists of the two theorems "R is an element of R" and $R is not an element of R" (where R stands for the Russell set. In the case of Cantor, we have one theorem, namely that there is no surjective map from the natural numbers to the real numbers. For this to be part of a paradox, we'd need a second theorem that says there is a surjective map from the natural numbers to the real numbers. Nobody (or more precisely nobody using the standard axioms of set theory) has proved such a theorem, so there is no paradox. 

The exclusion of pathological examples (i.e. the property of being "not too broad") is not the only desideratum in a definition. You also want the definition to allow certain natural constructions, so that, for example, you can construct products, quotients, coproducts, etc. Sometimes, in order for these constructions to make sense, you have to allow pathological examples. (For example, if you know some algebraic geometry, think about the quotient of a scheme by a subscheme). In other words, if you insist on having good objects, you might get a bad category of objects, or vice versa. One reason to tinker with definitions is that it forces us to explore this tradeoff. 

Surely people have made incorrect arguments that have been generally accepted as valid until they were examined more closely. But I don't think your imaginary pre-Cantor example could have been one of them, because, when presented with that argument, the first thing any mathematician would have asked is: What exactly do you mean by "same size"? What exactly do you mean by "bigger"? Then one of four things would have happened: 1) You might have given Cantor's definitions, in which case it would have been immediately obvious that your argument proves nothing. 2) You might have given some other definition which would have made it immediately apparent that your argument proves nothing. 3) You might have given some other definition according to which your argument is entirely correct (but not in conflict with Cantor's, because you and he are using the same words to mean different things). 4) You might not have had a precise answer, in which case the mathematician would have immediately known that you were talking nonsense. 

Where is the unit circle? Where is the number 17? Where is the euclidean plane? Where is the category of all sets? None of these things occupies a spatiotemporal location because (among other reasons) none of these things lives in our Universe, which is where the spatiotemporal locations are. Why would you expect a Universe to be located in our Universe, any more than you'd expect the number 17 to be? 

To be an elephant is sufficient but not necessary for being a mammal. To be a mammal is necessary but not sufficient for being an elephant. 

This might be a standard assumption in freshman and (sometimes) sophomore level economics classes, but it is certainly not a standard assumption among practitioners of neoclassical economics --- as you can plainly see for yourself by flipping through the pages of any current research journal. 

If I define a mammal to be a warm-blooded creature that gives birth to live offspring and has hair, and I define a fish to be a vertebrate that has fins and lives in the ocean, do whales (with their "mammal/fish duality") pose a challenge to ontology? Do whales demonstrate that creatures can have more than one nature? Or, perhaps, does it just mean that my arbitrary classification scheme, drawn up before I knew about whales, needs to be tweaked a little? 

So either 1) The person who said A intended to express statement C (in a very contorted way for some reason) or 2) the person who said A was confused. 

It's very hard for me to imagine how you could possibly theorize usefully about ontology or epistemology without testing your theories to see whether they say plausible things about mathematical entitities and our knowledge thereof. And it's very hard for me to imagine that you'd do a very good job of this unless you had a pretty clear understanding of the foundations of mathematics, which is to say a clear understanding of things like numbers and sets. 

Whatever your notion of "exist" might be, you say you are willing to acknowledge that an electron exists. An electron is a disturbance in a quantum field, so a fortiori you believe that at least some quantum fields exist. I can't imagine any criterion by which some quantum fields exist but the electromagnetic field does not. Do you have such a criterion in mind? 

The division of labor, as described by Smith, can lead to increasing returns to scale, which in turn means that it's impossible for each factor of production to paid its marginal product. This in turn implies that Euler's theorem alone can't account for the distribution of income. Insofar as the distribution of income is a central issue in economics, the division of labor is therefore of central importance. 

Utilitarianism is a brand of consequentialism --- that is, it judges actions by their effects. Libertarianism (at least as you seem to be defining it) is a brand of deontology --- that is, it judges actions by something other than their effects. They are therefore fundamentally at odds (as would be any other brand of consequentialism and any other brand of deontology), though of course there are modified versions of each that come closer to being compatible. 

If to be is to be the value of a bound variable, and if 1728 is the smallest number that is the sum of two cubes in two different ways, then the number 1728 exists. If moreover, in the absence of human (or other) minds, 1728 would still be the smallest number that is the sum of two cubes in two different ways, then the existence of the number 1728 does not depend on the existence of human (or other) minds. It seems to me be to be self-evident both that 1728 is the smallest number that is the sum of two cubes in two different ways, and that this would remain true in the absence of human (or other) minds. 

It seems to me there is a fundamental contradiction between two parts of your question. First you say: "I am an ultrafinitist". Then you ask how you should interpret modern mathematics. But ultrafinitism is an interpretation of mathematics. So either you subscribe to that interpretation, in which case you surely have no need to ask what it is, or you do not subscribe to it, in which case you are not an ultrafinitist. 

What's logically possible depends on your axioms. If your axioms about the Universe are satisfied by, say, ordinary Minkowski space, then your axioms cannot imply that the Universe had a beginning, because Minkowski space had no beginning. If your axioms about the Universe are sufficiently restrictive that they are satisfied only by our own Universe and no other, then they semantically imply that the Universe had a beginning, because our Universe had a beginning. Whether they logically (i.e. syntactically) imply that the Universe had a beginning is, I suppose, an open question. 

It depends, of course, on what counts as a computer simulation, which in turn depends, of course, on what counts as a computer. If the universe is anything like current physics says it is (with time infinitely divisible) then it can't be simulated on a (finite) digital computer, but there's no barrier to simulating it on a quantum computer --- in fact, the Universe itself can be that quantum computer. 

By your apparent definition, color is not real, and while we're at it, objects are not real. For that matter, space isn't real either, since space in GR is exactly as subjective as time. You are right that in a typical model of relativity there is no global time coordinate. But for a given observer at a given event, there is a preferred direction called "forward in time". That function from observers to directions is as real a mathematical object as the spacetime you started with. 

The reason there's not much criticism of Weintraub's cartoon version of neoclassical economics is that it's silly to waste time criticizing cartoons. In particular, note Weintraub's third assumption: 

Consider the argument with no premises and the conclusion "the sky is red". All the premises are (vacuously) true --- and surely "logically true", whatever you might mean by that --- but surely the conclusion is false and the argument is not valid. This is no better than R. Barzell's example, but it's even simpler. And it addresses your distinction between "true" and "logically true", by providing a list of premises all of which are true, all of which are logically true (again, whatever that means), all of which are false, all of which are logically false, and all of which have property glarb, whatever that might be.
