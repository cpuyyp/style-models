Perhaps try for a used fork. For a decent new 29er fork you're looking at Â£250+ (I estimate thats around $300) (such as rockshox reba) - or go rigid. It's sureley better than a cheap fork. 

Bikepacking tends to be more lightweight and generally doesn't involve panniers or racks. Just look at the rigs used by tour divide riders ($URL$ If you think you need pannniers, then perhaps you are talking about touring rather than bikepacking. Bikepacking luggage will typically require one or more of the following: 

I can appreciate that some materials are lighter than others and some have more flex than others, but overall, how do different frame materials affect handling of the bike? Assuming the same geometry and design. What are the main handling characteristics of each of the below common frame materials? 

One for every removeable or adjustable part on your bike (including tyres). With the exception of those you will be unable to repair/fix on the trail, such has hubs and bottom brackets. They need not all be combined with one tool though (sometimes individual tools can be lighter) 

For this setup you would need a derailleur with a capacity of (52-30)+(40-11) = 51 teeth. This page states that the SGS has a total capacity of 45 teeth. That's seems quite a bit below what you are trying to do, even if you don't plan on running big/big. 

One thing that I think has changed significantly is the quality of department store bikes. It used to be that you could go down to your local department store to get a quality bike. I'm not sure exactly when the transition happened, whether it was 10, 15, or 20 years ago, but at some point, almost all the bikes at large retailers became extremely low quality. Canadian Tire used to be a place to get a pretty decent bike. I use a 20 year old Canadian Tire (SuperCycle) as my rain bike. You pretty much have to go to a bike shop, or at least a dedicated sports store to get a decent quality bike that you can depend on. And when you are commuting, you want something you can depend on. 

In short, you can't. I find turning my head to the side a bit reduces the noise a bit in one ear, but you can't do this all the time. A rear view cycle mirror may help you. 

I had a similar problem on my bike. The manufacturer had made the rims too deep and it was causing the tube to conform to the odd extra "U" shape when pumped up. It took a while to figure out why I was going through so many tubes. Check with your manufacturer / retailer. I got mine replaced free of charge. Perhaps your rims have an abnormality near the valve hole. 

Sounds like you have only surface rust. The frame would have to rust through to cause any integrity problems and that would take many years of damp conditions. The creaking you hear when shifting your weight to the bars may be the headset. It may be worth getting it serviced. As its likely the grease has escaped/become clogged with dirt causing the creaking. It would be wise to check all the joints and welds for signs of fatigue or cracks. Ensure they are all solid. 

Talked to a guy who had a velomobile at a local charity ride. He said the thing cost $5000. Recumbents, while not as expensive as velomobiles are also quite expensive. Usually over $2000. That could be part of the reason. Sure, with economies of scale, they could be made cheaper, but that's kind of a chicken and an egg problem. Also, even though recumbents and velomobiles are so much more efficient, they do have quite a few of their own problems. Because they have so much extra weight, they tend to be quite a bit slower on the hills. Many people also don't like being so close to the ground. I like being able to stand on my pedals and see over most of the cars when riding in traffic. Also, regular bikes are pretty efficient these days. For $1000 you can get a pretty good bike. And one last thing. Don't underestimate the "conformity" factor. Many people don't want to be seen as weird, or outsiders, and want to fit in with social norms. Riding a bike is already going against social norms in many places. For some people, having a recumbent just takes things a bit outside their comfort zone. 

You will find (usually an allen/hex key) bolt on the brake pad itself. Loosen that, align your brake pads then re-tigthen. You may also need to adjust again on the bars to get it to fit. You will also find it easier when loose and aligning them, to pull the brakes right up to the rim and tighten the bolts. Everything you need to know you will find here: $URL$ 

It could be a number of things. The most likely it sounds as if your cable is sticking/jamming. Try replacing your cable and cable housing. This shouldnt cost much for DIY (read up on how to do it, you dont want to crush the housing when cutting), but would cost more from a mechanic. I would firstly check that your deraileur isnt out of alignment and/or loose or bent first. Another thing you can do is check that you have the right chain for your cassette and that the chain isnt worn (a cheap tool will check this for you). If your mechanic has not solved this, I suggest trying a different one. 

I would think that both these are from different manufacturers, or maybe slightly different product lines (DuraAce vs. Ultegra). I can't think of why a manufacturer would bother shipping 2 identical chains with one only having 2 links more than the other. Choose one based on some other criteria such as which brand you trust more, or which is actually supposed to be better. 

This would be completely fine. You only really have to worry when going to a much wider range. Smaller road derailleurs cannot deal well with big differences between the largest and smallest gear, but they can all handle a 15 tooth difference. Things only start to get compatible once you move beyond 11-28. Shimano/SRAM are compatible for 8-9-10 speed cassettes. Things aren't compatible at the 11 speed level. According to this chart, Shimano and SRAM mountain Cassettes are compatible at 11 speed, but for the road there is a small difference in sprocket pitch. 

One tip I have picked up to avoid cars passing so close is to ride further away from the kerb (but not so far you're hogging the road and then drivers get annoyed). This seems to have some pycological effect on drivers to give you more room. I can't explain it, but found it to work in most cases. I have also seen bikes with mirrors fitted and some sort of plastic distance keeper (a pole that sticks out with a reflector on, I would imagine this needs to break if a car hits it.) 

My free hub body has cracked and im looking to replace it. I have discovered it uses a 14mm hex key to remove. I cannot find a freehub body for sale that matches m785. Will a "m760-m765" body fit my "m785" hub? 

Most components will have an instruction sheet detailing the reccomended torque. This is typically measured in Nm (newton meters). Torque wrenches can also be purchased that show you how much torque you apply. Some components even have the reccomended torque value on the component itself. Checking other components will give you an indication of the difference in required torque in relation to your BB. 

With some Googling, I was able to find this bulk bar tape. However, at $156 for about 10 bars worth, it doesn't seem like you get much of a deal. Plus the site looks really shady. But if you aren't wasting so much, it might end up as a net positive for you. But it does confirm that such a product does exist. Try to look for a reputable retailer to sell you bulk tape. 

According to this post they appear to be date codes. There is a list of date codes here. They are outdated, but you can follow the pattern to figure out when the sprocket was made. the one in your picture appears to be from October/November 2001 if this theory is correct. This site has a more recent list indicating that this trend has continued. The date codes from that page are partially copied below in case those old forums disappear. This doesn't appear to make sense with codes like aq/ar, but the codes on the sprocket shown most likely indicate date of manufacturer. AQ/AR may indicate the model of cassette they came from. Shimano documentation says that ar is associated with the CS-HG400 9 speed sprockets. AQ seems to be associated with the CS-M770 cassette. If you google the specific code you are looking for, such as "shimano code aq" (without quotes) you will most likely find shimano documentation for the part in question.

Depending on design, try ensuring all bolts are tightened evenly (so if the top two are done up all the way and the bottom two are not, undo them all and redo them evenly) 

I would reccomend against this. It only takes 10 seconds to hop on a bike and make off. Although some suggestions come to mind 

You can go as tall as you like. Have you seen those tall bikes that people must climb up a ladder to use? However practicality is another thing. As the comments have said - enough room to stand-over is a good start. Try getting a bike-fit, adjusting certain geometry (saddle hight, stem etc) may help in your circumstances. 

There are a lot of things you could do that would make it difficult to make a speedy getaway. Anything that would hinder you would also hinder a thief. 

I have two bikes, a hybrid commuter with skinny tyres, full mud guards & rim brakes, then I have a 29er hardtail MTB with hydraulic disc brakes and off road tyres. Which would be best, for commuting (with a minimum modification cost) in the snow? (this is likeley to be a small-medium amount of snow, perhaps having been compressed by other vehicles/walkers)
