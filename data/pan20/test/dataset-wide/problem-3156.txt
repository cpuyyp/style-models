The siege of Carthage was the main event in the third Roman war. It went on from 149 B.C. to the spring of 146 B.C. According to Wikipedia the Carthaginians would have had about 410 000 citizens and 90 000 defenders. How did the Carthaginians keep their population alive? It wasn't like everyone in the city was doing nothing either, as 

Vegetius wrote after the professionalization of the Roman armies, the Marian reforms. The original Hastati, Principes and Triarii referred to degrees of wealth(and thus equipment) and experience of the troops in the unit. After the reforms these distinctions became meaningless as the troops where state-equipped. At the time when Vegetius wrote the roman army had been reorganized again, this time by Diocletianus. There are again important distincions in troop quality, but they carry names like Limitianei and Comitanses, the first defended the borders and the latter formed the field army. I have heard that the Romans still sometimes referred to the lines with the old distincions, when the troops where sorted in three lines. But if this was the case they probably would have referred to the first line as hastati and so on, your quote seems very strange. 

There was always a question of how one culture replaces another...in the Ubaid period, this transition is now thought to be a gradual adoption of one culture to the next as opposed to a violent overthrow and pottery is the number one reason we think that now. Pottery can also link civilizations via trade as there is a good potential pottery was one of our species first trade goods. If culture A possesses pottery that is very distinctly theirs, but we find evidence of this pottery within Culture B's cities, then we can surmise that trade has occurred in some manner (or war/plunder) between these two cultures. We can also link cities and culture that belong to like cultural groups by their pottery...when a city is uncovered, especially one dating back to 5000 BC and earlier, the abundance of pottery left behind becomes the easiest method of identifying the cultural grouping and period that the city ruins date to. Even a lack of pottery provides evidence of the period a people came from (PPNA, or pre-pottery neolithic A and later PPNB). We've also used Pottery to distinguish ages, just as we like to use 'Iron Age' and 'Bronze Age', 'pottery' and 'pre-pottery' are used as terms to distinguish a period of time in human development prior to the bronze age (starting in the 12000bc range to around 3800bc). Oddly this period is often lumped into what we broadly call the 'stone age', though it's a distinct age and stepping stone towards the bronze age. And finally...pottery was often artwork. $URL$ 

In medieval Europe character was defined by the four temperaments. The choleric temperament is called "gele gal" in dutch, which translates to yellow bile. From Wikipedia: 

The Hetairoi (companions: regiments of noble heavy shock cavalry) of Alexander where often rewarded with land after victories. After the Galatians arrived in Anatolia they took land for themselves. The Ptolemaic Pharaoh's later gave many of them land in the fayuum delta in reward for military service. Giving land in reward for military service was common among the successor states. Many of ALexanders city's started by settling veterans in them. William the conqueror did the same for his nobles thing after his conquest of England. Before that the Saxons had taken land for themselves after their conquest of England. It seems settling conquered lands with their own soldiers and families was common among the German tribes, since Caesar already records this practice by Ariovistus. Similarly after the crusades many nobles would receive (or take) land after a victory. Land grants in the roman military where already mentioned. Giving land to core soldiers seems a common reward, in ancient and medieval times. This has a double purpose: Motivating those soldiers with a future reward (many of them where not actually paid) and controlling the newly conquered land. 

There was a massive change genetically in England that suggests a huge number of the native population was killed off. This is relatively unique, especially within Europe. Quite literally, the majority of 'Roman English' speakers were killed off and their language wasn't able to influence Enlgish as heavily as it did the Romance languages. 

They couldn't. In this time frame, the Byzantine empire was thoroughly stretched financially from the wars in Persia (Byzantine - Sassanian wars) and later the Arabic wars. Their lands were struggling under harsh tax rates to support these armies as is and the devastation from the conflict started to impact what wealth the lands could produce. War is costly and the Byzantines were pushing a point where they could no longer afford war. The Western Empire was even worse off...the power squabbles hit almost absurd heights and there was no longer any consistency in leadership. Most western empire emperors were somewhat contested (and in some cases not even recognized by the eastern empire) and the ones that were recognized had horribly short reigns, usually coming to death at the hands of an assassin or their own army turning on them. Tax collectors and most officials were corrupt and held little loyalty to anyone but themselves, meaning what taxes were collected rarely ended up in Roman coffers (slaying the Roman officials/tax collectors and proclaiming oneself emperor happened a few times as well, such as the Gordinians in Carthage). There were a few periods where a loyal subject of Rome that wanted to pay his/her taxes couldn't find a representative to pay taxes to. For info on how absurd this got, Year of the Five Emperors (google it for details) was an outright absurd time (193ad), yet somehow the Romans managed to outdo themselves in 236 with the year of the six emperors (I really recommend reading the intro here: $URL$ you have a cruel tyrant, a young aristocrat revolt, an elderly emporer and his son, a jealous neighbor, riots in Rome, an army killing it's own general, and feuding co-emperors publicly put to death...all in under a year). 

Post #6 in this thread discusses the possibility of high female gestapo agents. Apparently there isn't any evidence for them. They did find this link which proves the existence of at least one female Gestapo, but it isn't clear what her rank was. 

In dutch it's a lot easier: 1500-1800 is the nieuwe tijd, wich translates to new time, and 1800 to now is the hedendaagse periode, wich translates to contemporary period. I've never heard of a distinction for the period after world war II. I can maybe help you with the first question though: we define the start of the early modern period by events like the fall of Byzantium in 1453, the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg in the same period and the discovery of America by Columbus. The end is mainly defined by the french and the American revolution, and the fall of Napoleon. I have heard of the postmodern period before but never in history classes, just behavior sciences (in high school). I just did a quick google and it seems almost all results are about literature, architecture and culture in general. I think it is rarely used in history. 

7 years later was $URL$ in which a new Roman fleet had been built without a dime being spent by the now exhausted republic treasury: 

There are parts that are reliable and parts that are not so much. You can readily tell, simply by the name of the work itself, that it is written from the Roman standpoint (to the Jewish people, this book would be entitled 'The Roman War' after all) and it's skewed to a pro-Roman stance from that. That being said, he appears to be a mix bag himself with his position lying somewhere between loyalty/appeasement to the Romans, but somewhat faithful to the Jewish aristocratic's he descended from (stating the aristocrats were peaceful and accomodating) instead blaming the conflict on 'Jewish brigands/rebels/bandits' (probably 'extemists' in todays language) He does appear to have access to military documentation from the Romans side and much of this information is verifiable. He also got distances very close to exact. $URL$ 

*I had to weigh it myself, and i don't have any grain for horses. If anyone knows a better weight i'd be happy to recalculate (not really). 

The french maillotins (wiki only in french) led a revolt in Paris, and consisted of several thousands of armed men. They managed to keep Charles VI imprisoned (in his palace ofcourse) for some time and held on to the city for about a year. Their name comes from the lead hammers of the weapons-depot of the city that where used to defend the walls from attackers. The Huscarls of the Scandinavians and eleventh century Angle-Saxons fought with two handed Dane-axes. The Varangian guard of the byzantine emperors used the same weapon. Though an elite guard they numbered 6000 in the beginning. (Harald Hardrada, the guy who fought Harold Godwinson and his previously mentioned Huscarls for the throne of England was a Varangian btw). Many ancient germanic warriors chose to wield clubs. some of them where depicted on Trajans column possesing swords but chosing to wield clubs (click next till number 17). 

This militaristic nature may have staved off the Russian slaughter that befell the Aluutiq people, but the major reason their culture has endured has more to due with Geography and the British/Canadian peoples...they lived further north into area's the residential schooling policies were never enacted as opposed to the many tribes further south that got caught up in residential schools. This might be a living answer as it'll be updated as I find more information. 

Pottery is likely one of the easiest things to trace in early neolithic human history and has become a major route of linking cultures and proving early trade. Neolithic pottery is actually quite abundant (it survives the test of time quite well) and we can often trace a peoples movements and transitions of culture via their pottery. Pottery is one of the first pieces of technology that emerges with urbanization (a 'city' provided both the need for pottery and the ability to create it). A pottery style is often unique to a culture and the (relatively abundant) pottery left behind gives good insight into which culture left behind the city ruins. The best example I can give is from the Halaf-Ubaid Transitional period ($URL$ When a culture or region transitions from one culture to the next...was it a gradual transition or was it abrupt? This answer can often be deduced from the pottery 

In the end progress in a war like this was made by capturing castles and cities, or keeping them. (the focus on big battles can be misleading) Bertrand du Guesclin did both. If it wasn't for him the english would have conquered Rennes and Nantes (and thus held Bretagne). He also advised charles to use a scorched earth tactic against the invasion of Richard III. Richard besieged many cities but failed to take any but Caen. (fun story, in the English wikipedia this is only rewarded one sentence: Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. while it's rewarded half a page on the French.) He also helped Henri of Trastamare on the spanish throne, and as a bonus managed to lure several thousands of mercenaries (who had been living as robbers in france for decades) with him. In the end the progress made by Du Guesclin was obtained by fighting against the free companies, defending castles and methodically besieging castle after castle, which is how he died 

(This is actually from the story of Molson which became one of the prominent brewers in Canada. $URL$ 'For Beer and Country!') During WWII, the Ontario Brewers took up a public relations battle to ensure the prohibition of WWI would not return. 

In short...when you are facing wooden walls and lightly armored horsemen that aren't aware you are coming, horse archers do amazingly well. When you are facing an enemy with stone castles and heavy cavalry, your horse archers have little they can do. After these changes were made, engagements between Mongols and Hungarian soldiers were solid wins for the Hungarians with heavy losses to Mongol forces. 

Still looking for any reference to Peter the Great wanting to circumnavigate the globe...but this is the best I have after a day of looking. 

Not really due to British involvement. By the time Hitler attacked Russia, these oil fields were in British hands. I believe the same goes with Iraqi oil fields further south. If Russia lost it's Baku oil, I believe Siberia might be the only remaining option. A second source for verification. $URL$ 

As the image above shows most of the peninsula would have been occupied by the Romans, so more then a little farming seems impossible. So my question is twofold: 1) How did the Carthaginians manage to procure enough food to keep most of their population alive and working for three years and 2) How did they manage to get enough drinking water? (I know they had large cisterns to store water, but can that really have been enough for the whole population, Especially with large amounts of refugees from the countryside?) 

Zoroastrism is probably the only monotheistic neighbor of Judaism that i know of, and since it originated from the 7th century BC it is about 2 centuries older then Judaism. I don't know whether it was henotheistic though. 

One pound of horse meat has about 603 calories. warhorses weigh between 800 and 2000 pounds, so the amount of calories would be anywhere between 482.400 and 1.206.000 calories. Since a grown man needs about 2500 calories a day, he can eat for another 192,6 to 482,4 days. |Edit As has been remarked in the comments only part of the horse is edible. Apparently this could be about two-thirds of the meat in case of cows. I couldn't find any numbers for horses but since we're talking about warhorses who where not bred for eating the percentage would probably be lower. Keep in mind though that supposedly non-edible parts become very attractive as you get hungrier.| Of course, provided he can keep the food good for so long. Since in ancient times the only place a 1000 man horse army trapped in a siege seems likely is the east, it is probably too hot for that. The only ways to keep food good in the warmer regions of the ancient world would be smoking or salting, but it's doubtful a besieged army has enough access to any of these to preserve a 1000 horses. A horse should eat about 0,3 to 0,4 percent of it's body weight in grain, which is about 24 to 80 pounds per day, so 5 days of grain makes for 120 to 400 pounds. A male Roman citizen would eat about 4 modii of grain per month (source: my prof), making 36 liters of grain. 1 liter of (chicken*) grain weighs 690 grams, so 24,84 kilos or 54,763 pounds per month or 1,8254333 pounds per day. Thus the grain for his horse would keep him fed for 2-7 months. I'd like to add that a desperate sally by heavy cavalry could be a much better option, and has proven succesfull in the past. An example:
