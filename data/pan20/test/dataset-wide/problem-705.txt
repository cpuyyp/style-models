I need to replace a tube in my bike. I know there are many tire sizes. I bought 26', assuming that my bike was that size, and realized when I got home that I didn't even know where to measure from. What is the correct location to measure in order to get the correct size of tubes? 

I'm seriously considering bicycling to work, and I'd like some advice on the way to choose a route. Specifically, I have these two options: 

Some time ago, I stuck a U-lock on my bicycle for safe keeping, on the top tube below the seat. It's annoying when riding, and I'd like a way to remove it. I've lost the key some time ago, or I would have removed it that way. Preserving the lock is optional. What would you suggest? 

Go on a path with only 2 cross streets, but a road that is 55 mph. I'd probably have to bike off-road, but there's a well maintained dirt shoulder. Go on a path with a bike lane, only 35 mph traffic, but many cross streets, traffic lights, etc. 

I figured out a way to do it which was actually fairly easy. This only worked because it was in my garage, trying to steal someone's bike like this would be crazy... I took a hammer, and pounded on the bar. The first thing that happened was the plastic broke away. I kept pounding on it, until the lock just fell apart. It took about a minute... Note to self, don't buy a cheap lock next time... 

I have this bike: $URL$ Frame Size is 17.5 Crank is: Shimano Deore XT, 38/24 I purchased a garmin edge. It asks for Crank length for the cadence business. How do I get my crank length? Should I get out a tape and measure it? 

Yes, HT works well as a general purpose machine. I've used a Hard Tail for everything. Harsh single Trails, Cross-country racing, 300km road trips. I found it works pretty well. I do recommend getting a suspension with 'lockouts' (A remote lockout even better, but at least manual lockouts). For road trips, I usually pump my tires to it's maximum. (65psi or so) for lower rolling resistance and lock my fork. I do the opposite for trails. With that said, for more serious/fast road trips, having a good road bike helps with efficiency, (about 10-30% more efficient at higher speeds). 

It happens when you put pressure on the chain, not when switching gears, right? If it's a more recent issue, usually this happens due to wear & tear on Chain/Cogs/Chain ring. (Chain rings wear off and become less able to grip the chain. I had to replace my chain ring a few months ago when that happened. Replacing chain rings doesn't mean replacing the whole crank. For Cogs sometimes you can swap out just the bottom most worn cogs. Chains have to be replaced every 2000k or so on a MTB, probably less often on a road bike. 

Figured this one out after a bit of work. If you look from the back side, you will see that there is a gap in the metal. This is to allow compression to clamp the seat tightly. Put the clamp on the frame of the bike, and if there is a quick release, tighten the nut hand tight. Then put the seat at the right level, facing the right direction, and close the quick release. If there isn't a quick release, tighten the nut hand tight, put the seat in place, and tighten it the rest of the way using the correct tool to do so. 

Each is about the same distance, so that's not a significant factor. I'm more familiar with the first route, as it's a clear cut reason to drive that way, but I know my way around the second route. There really isn't any other routes, although I might be able to make the second route a bit more off of a main road with a bit of work... Also, feel free to give any generic advice to choosing a bicycle route. 

I recently moved, and had to take off the seat to my bike while I moved. I was surprised to find when I arrived and settled that I couldn't find the clamp to my bike seat. I managed to find a new bike seat clamp, but it's not obvious how I'm supposed to install it. What should I do? I've included a photo of my bike seat, without the clamp. Don't be confused by the bike behind it, the black seat post and seat and red body is the one I'm working on. My bike is a GT avalanche, unmodified from the store.
