Sensation - it can feel it's own body; corollary, it can feel pain if it's body is harmed; additionally, it can detect the presence of any interloper, though it has no mechanism for identifying them specifically, it can gauge an entity's general level of magicallity. Sentience - it can think, furthermore, it has had a great deal of time to do so. Communication - it can relate to other minds by projection of thoughts via the medium of images and sensations. 

Closing note. This question largely has to do with cultural perceptions. It's therefore hard to say how we might feel about Necromancy if it were, you know, actually a thing that could and did happen. Portrayals of Necromancy haven't helped at all, really. You've already touched on this by pointing out that usually Necromancers are mad, evil, or both. Generally they're egomaniacal, murderous, and usually they're interested in conquering the world - typical comic-book villains for typical comic-book villainy. It won't be hard to bring a more nuanced angle to this aspect of fiction. What if, and I know I'm being speculative here, but what if there was a necromancer (or even more than one!?) who didn't want to conquer the world, slay all the living, and reanimate their corpses to go to his insane tea party? What if he had good hygiene and expected the same from his unliving tools? And what if he knew how to give a skeleton a spade or hammer instead of a sword and shield? Some more good questions to ask going into your world-building: How long has Necromancy been a thing? Is there other magic, and how are other magicians regarded? Is there cosmic good and evil in your setting (our world is mostly grey and grey, but in The Lord of Rings there are obvious good guys and obvious bad guys, who go along with the associated gods - the same goes for most other epic fantasy settings)? If Necromancy is generally tolerated, are there some who rail against it? Is there a god who condones or even sponsors necromancy, what about one who opposes it? Is Necromancy accepted everywhere, or just in one region or country? 

No While this might work for most cases, it won't work for "hard cases" - stuff that depends a lot on circumstance, or where there is no precedent - for example most cases involving slayer laws or in emergency situations such as the speluncean explorers (where some of the decisions are based on stuff such as what does the public want, or if there is an expectation of executive pardon) It also fails to ensure that the law is enforced as intended - for example Adultery is illegal in many places, but not prosecuted - is this a law? - times changes, opinions change - be it if alcohol is legal/illegal, marijuana, LGBT, etc. - and normally society changes before the written law changes, so if the written law was enforced as written, then there would be many problems. Computers are also horrible at reading intent or motives, which is a critical part in evaluating many laws, such as what supercat's answer wrote - consider anti-monopoly laws where a large corporation may be willing to accept the slap-on-the-wrist fine while enjoying huge profits - or big Phara companies suing each other to continue being the sole source of drug X, and thus get an injunction preventing anyone else from selling X, even if their patent has run dry because of bogus quality concerns or other issues - they continue getting tons of $, at the relatively minor costs of lawyers in comparison. Or what happened with lavabit when it technically complied with a court request to turn over it's SSL keys, and they did so by printing it in a tiny font 

Depends on how the resulting inflation is spread through the economy. In most general terms: it would affect those who save money, and those who borrow money. Theoretically, it will not affect wage earners (because if inflation is spread perfectly evenly through the economy, wages should go up at the same rate as all other prices). Of course, in the real world, inflation won't spread evenly. If history is any guide, wages won't actually participate in the inflation. The impact on savers and borrowers is complicated. Those who saved at fixed interest rates before starting this form of taxation will lose the most. Those who borrowed at fixed interest rates before starting this form of taxation will benefit the most. Those who save or borrow after this scheme starts will see the interest rate spread increase corresponding to the amount of money being printed. Investors in assets will (again, theoretically - asssuming a perfectly even spread of inflation) neither lose nor benefit, because whatever assets they invested in will rise in value along with inflation. Investors in derivatives (futures, options etc.) or any time-based assets will need to carefully do the math. 

I am a mad scientist who has discovered a way of efficiently killing all sorts of annoying flies, from mosquitoes to fruit flies, and want to unleash my creation upon the unsuspecting buzzers. However, I want to do it in a way such that I don't destroy the entire ecosystem by removing an important food source for birds, bats, frogs, etc. or replace any sort of other potentially useful properties of the flies (including preventing aliens from destroying the earth). How can I best accomplish this? 

If there was to be a habitable planet, similar to earth, but with varying gravity at different points on its surface - lets pretend that it varies from .8g to 1.2g - what sort of terrain or form would be necessary in order for this to exist? it would still need to have a large amount of liquid water, so mechanically a very tall mountain range would need to not fall under it's own weight (and ideally also have a breathable atmosphere at such heights). It could spin much faster on it's axis, and have some sort of Centrifugal force, which would reduce the gravity near the equator, but also mess up any sort of day/night cycle, and again, potentially the atmosphere. Are there any alternatives? some sort of weird but feasible planet geometry? a large moon that can reduce the gravity on the surface of the planet depending on it's position in orbit? 

Your library has rather limited options for self defense. It cannot cast spells, as it has no mechanism to learn them (the last man on earth has all the time in the world to read, but broke his glasses?). It cannot manipulate its own structure (thereby trapping, discombobulating, or otherwise interfering with an interloper). It cannot even properly track cause-and-effect, as it has no mechanism for linking any sort of pain it feels to the presence of a particular outsider. In your example, say there are 10 people in a room, and the library experiences the pain of a bookshelf being broken. Did one of the interlopers cause this pain? If so, which one? How would it discover this? It couldn't even ask, because its telepathy only allows the projection (and not the receiving) of thoughts. Your library needs guardians. Of course, according to your proposed caveats, the library has no means of creating these guardians itself; the most likely explanation to my thinking is that the library has requested such patronage from among its visitors. Perhaps an order of magical monks or bookish scholars now maintains permanent residence therein, or perhaps a single powerful magician calls the library home. Another possibility is that a number of individuals maintain regular custodianship of the library. A select number of wizards, for instance, might take shifts dropping in to place and restore wards, maintenance automagical guardians and servitors, mend books, clean, etc. Such guardianship would not be hard to establish, the library would simply need to communicate to a trusted visitor (perhaps recognized by his magical signature) that it required such guardianship. A final possibility - the library is telepathic - is telepathy common in your world? Can the magically skilled learn it easily, or at all? If not, it could be extremely disconcerting to even powerful magicians to have their minds invaded, and they would likely have little defense against it. If the library could overwhelm a person's mind with sufficiently strong and malicious communication, it could - perhaps - render them catatonic, overwhelm them with intense fear or anxiety, induce any number of debilitating conditions of the psyche, or even lead them astray and into dangerous encounters. 

Yes, but with a caveat. Printing money is effectively the same as taxation, but with far less control and supervision. First of all, "the government" always "prints money". Actually, in most countries, it's not the government, but some central bank that is usually semi-independent, such as the Federal Reserve in the USA, the ECB in Europe, or the Bank of England in Britain. and the money is not created through physical printing bills, but through loan transactions. This "printing money" should be balanced by money being destroyed (through loans being paid off, mostly), and economic growth. When more money is created beyond that balance, you get inflation (either systemic inflation throughout the economy, or sometimes investment bubbles such as the housing bubble of the early 21st century, or stock bubbles). Inflation simply means that each unit of currency (dollar or whatever) will be worth less. Now what you are proposing is basically that the extra money goes to finance the government, but those who already have money or income (i.e., the population) suffers the loss of value of money. In other words, the population pays for the government's operation. Which is no different from taxation, just through another means. Here are some of the problems - and benefits - of using "printing money" instead of taxes to finance the government: 

Their legs are vulnerable - they have a large surface area to volume, which means that they won't be able to be heavily armored, as any added mass on the legs would greatly restrict mobility (moving legs -> moving tank, adding weight -> slower legs -> slower robot) - very similar to how cars try to minimize their unsprung wheel weight as much as possible in order to remain fast & efficient. Furthermore they have many exposed joints which are vulnerable to getting gunk / sludge / stuff stuck in them, which would make them unable to move Speaking of efficiency, jumping is not an efficient maneuver - while I won't doubt your 15m jumping ability, as you can hand-wave an energy source, you will also need to hand-wave it as to why it won't make sense to use that energy source in a more efficient method (i.e. traditional tank, flying robot, whatever) You mentioned wheels on the legs - All of the above still applies, you need to not only make it possible, but make it somehow better than the alternative (normal wheeled vehicle, or even compared to a tread-drive tank). Strong, light-weight armor? Why not put a plate 2x as thick on a regular tank for more protection? That said, there is one distinct advantage that the legs give your tanks - that is they can step over large obstacles or cross very difficult terrain. You may want to reference the AT-ATs from star wars and see how their legged tanks could adapt to various terrains. 

First off, the question is somewhat meaningless. A society where such a lack of privacy is possible will not devolve into a zero-privacy society, but rather into a society where privacy becomes a luxury good. This also means that privacy would become asymmetric: ordinary people wouldn't have privacy, but elites would keep it (as would governments). In this scenario, trust would not be enhanced, but undermined. This happens because ordinary people have no reason to trust elites (who would still have privacy), and elites would fear that ordinary people might still eke out enough privacy to stage an uprising. By the way, this type of society is by no means utopian. That is one reason I arrived at the privacy-as-a-luxury-good. Privacy is a very recent invention to begin with. Privacy only started taking hold when people were able to build large enough houses or apartments to have rooms to retreat to. In many parts of the world, privacy has effectively been outlawed. The most obvious example is North Korea, but also in the Pilgrim's New England, there were laws that prohibited anybody from living alone; for singles, widowers or widows, etc., having roommates were mandatory "to prevent sin". Today's NSA/GCHQ is actually somewhat similar: they expect complete privacy for themselves (under threat of life in prison or even a death penalty), yet insist that nobody else be allowed to have privacy (even to the point where Britain's Cameron suggested outlawing encryption). The hypothetical society in the original question would suffer the same fate. Possessing these types of drones, or the 3-d printers that produce them, would likely be unavailable to ordinary people. They would likely be illegal, and since there is no privacy, it would also be impossible for ordinary people to illegally own them. So, no, a true zero-privacy society for everybody is not going to happen. Privacy-as-a-luxury-good would be the real outcome.
