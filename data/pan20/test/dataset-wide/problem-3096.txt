Disclaimer: IANAH. Not even an amateur one. Several customs made Marriage expensive, as in some sense it still is. They very at least across period, country/region, and social class. As mentioned in the comments, Dowry, Dower and Bride-Price were all customs by which one party to the marriage must provide some sort of financial compensation in order for the marriage to take place. A Dowry involved payment to the husband by the bride's parents, in certain traditions directly to the groom, and in others to the bride as a means to establish her new home to similar standards in which she was raised. A bride-price was payed by the groom to the bride's parents, and A Dower was property turned over to the bride by the husband. These customs were instruments that facilitated the arrangement of marriage in various ways. They could ensure a wife's position in case the marriage resulted in separation or divorce. They could guarantee a certain quality of life for the wife, at least at the beginning of the marriage, and the transferred wealth could then be passed on to descendents. A large dowry could be used to lure a husband of higher social class or prospects, or to marry off a daughter who did not attract suitors on her own merits. On the other hand, a daughter who was highly attractive (in appearance or personal qualities) might solicit a proposal of marriage even without any dowry to offer, a major plot device in "Pride and Prejudice", for example. a Dowry could also be used a device for negotiating alliances, when a union between households had geopolitical significance, negotiations over the dowry could in effect express the terms of the alliance. We see traces of this in the opening Scene of "King Lear", for example. A bride-price was paid by the husband to the parents of the bride, suggesting that it was in the husband's interest to seek the marriage. Besides these customs, the customs relating to the wedding itself are also varied and could be expensive then, as indeed it can be today. However, an expensive celebration was often an expression of wealth particular to social class. As early as the late 18th century in Wales, so-called "Cardigan Weddings" in which the guests were invited "to bring the feast with them", as it were, were common, and therefore the cost of the wedding feast was in some locations was not prohibitive. Civil marriages were possible in France since the end of the 18th century, and in engaged by the middle of th 19th century. The reduced cost of marriage by an official meant that it was much less of a hurdle if it had ever been. In England, a long-standing custom called "the banns", required that an upcoming marriage first be announced to the congregation in church, and time given for members of the community to raise objections, if one of the parties being married, or if they were related in some way. It seem plausible to me that this custom was the origin of the familiar "speak now or forever hold your peace" part of the Christian marriage ceremony, but I haven't investigated. The delay involved during the waiting period associated with "the banns" was an inconvenience to some. Understandable if one remembers that people often married young, and that chastity before marriage meant that any delay of the wedding also meant a delay of the young couple's sexual relationship. That goes some way to explaining why young couples, and perhaps the groom in particular, sometimes felt an "urgent" need to have the wedding as soon as possible. To facilitate this, the possibility of marrying using a "wedding bond" instead of waiting for the "banns" was instituted. The couple were allowed to marry without delay, but the husband was required to post a bond on the guarantee that there exists no lawful reason for marriage not to take place. The bond had a term of a year or so, and if the marriage turned out to have been unlawful, the value of the bond was forfeited. As the more specific issue of the exchange in Ibsen's play, I think the explanation is that for various reasons, possibly bride-price as mentioned later in the play, engaging in a "proper", respectable marriage according to upper middle-class norms was indeed expensive but, no less importantly, it was also "rigid". Oswalds' stay in Paris among his artist-friends clearly suggests they are living a bohemian lifestyle and so although they may not be able to afford all the accoutrement of a bourgeois marriage, they are also probably not particularly interested in settling into such a "respectable" family life. Instead, they engage in illicit affairs, which result in children and then simply go on to set up home with the women they are involved with. It's not implied that these women were the same "daughters from good homes" which they could afford neither to marry nor ,presumably, to provide for in the style to which they were accustomed and their parents demanded.

Excellent question; we often hear that "life was better before" and that "back in the day when there was a single bread winner, things were awesome." I contend that this presumption is a little off. To answer it we must look at the demographics of a country to get an answer. Let's look at the USA at 1900: The 1900 census reported that the US had 60 % of its population living in rural circumstances. 60% of the population lived on the land! That implies that the largest segment of the US population engaged in farming, not wage labor. And can you visualize a housewife on a family farm just hanging out at home and reading magazines and gossiping? No way! Everyone was working their buts off the whole summer, including women and children. So to answer your question, no in 1900 there was not a single wage earner in a typical family. There were zero wage earners and plenty of work to do. After the industrial revolution, some farming families would send their teenage daughters to work in factory towns to be wage earners. One example of this is from 60 years earlier in Lowell. These girls traveled from their farms to Lowell, worked for 3 or 4 years and lived in company dorms. They had no spending money, as their wages was sent back to their families. This "teenage girls go to the city" stuff is still happening, if you watch China Blue you can see it in modern form. Another example I know of relates to Japan between 1870 and 1910. Silk export constituted the bulk of foreign exchange earnings that were used to modernize Japan. And the silk was processed through the underpaid labor of young Japanese women working in silk factories. They worked for years dipping their hands into boiling water to grab silkworm cocoons. We can dig further and find more examples, but my point is obvious: In both rural and urban situations in the past, most women worked very hard for survival just like men. (Likewise, single working mothers were not rare either; disease and war were still overly common) But why on earth do we always hear about the good old days of when Women were expected to just be housewives, and they "had to have dinner ready by the time hubby gets home from the office" and they "had to make sure to wear heels and pearls so that he is happy". We hear about this so much, but in 1900 and before, it obviously wasn't so. Where does this meme of the eternal housewife come from? I don't have a source for this, but the concept of "working husband with a stay-at-home housewife" is a middle class / upper middle class "value" that started in the 1800 as the growing middle class sought to imitate the behavior of royalty. Supposedly in the post WWII US economy, aided by the GI Bill, most Americans became "middle class in the late 1940s and 1950s. So I think a good assumption is that the concept of "most families" having "stay at home wives" began in the 1950s. However, I haven't seen any demographics proving this. I know both my grandmothers worked in the 50's and 60's once my parents were in school. From this anecdotal evidence, I assume that at no time in history did most families in the USA have "stay-at-home" women. I'll make another assumption: Today, upper-middle-class women have the luxury of choice to be housewives. They might live in large suburban houses, while their partner earns a fortune doing something. These people existed in 1900 as well. However, the women today in these well-to-do situations can have a career, while in the 1900's women in this social class were expected not to work in anything except charity. Unfortunately, this wealthy class did not, and does not constitute "most people". 

EDIT I'm sorry, but I may have been a bit off on the reasons for keeping the shutters 'alive'. It has since dawned on me that privacy might be one of the main reasons. In Portugal (and most of France) houses are pretty close by and, unless you want your neighbours to see what's going on inside your house (you don't want it), you'll need some form of protection: shutters and curtains. During the day, when shutters aren't used, windows are protected by a light curtain that allows homeowners to see what's happening outside but doesn't let the others look in. In the evening, when lights are on, people outside can see through the light curtains into the home. Therefore, you either add heavy curtains to the mix or you add shutters. One thing that I find extremely uncomfortable in 'anglophone' houses as seen in films and TV shows is how vulnerable the homeowners are in terms of privacy. Any curious neighbour will be able to spy them as they go about their private life since the houses in such films / shows never have shutters and rarely have curtains. It's unsettling. So perhaps keeping the shutters is also in direct relation to how many peeping-Toms a society expects to find amidst one's neighbours. 

EDIT TO ADD MORE DETAILS (I'm using school History text books as source) By the 10th century, crossbows were already in use but only became regularised in 1299 with an edict by King D. Dinis requiring every town to have a militia of these men. By the mid 14th century the militia had become a force of elite. All men should be tested and the best of them (with the financial means to maintain the weapon in good state, which excluded the poorest peasants) would be part of this elite. If the financial means were above a certain level, they were also required to have a horse. However, most of these men would eventually be chosen amidst mercantile and craftsmen families, since farmers were often poorer and, on the other hand, their service on the land was essential to feeding the army and the population in general. This doesn't mean that, in rural areas, one wouldn't find a large portion of these men to be farmers. Training focused on developing speed recharging but especially on accuracy. The arrow could go 150-200 metres (164-218 yards) and was often poisoned with hellebore (known as 'erva dos besteiros' or 'herb of the crossbow archers'), although the church did not aprove of it. Crossbows were not often used in open battle but in sieges (there were plenty of those in the Iberian peninsula throughout the centuries, much more than field battles). An accurate crossbow archer was held in high regard as he could kill a person on a castle wall with a single shot, therefore making this class an elite amidst the infantry. 

Most phenomenal rise was by Zhu Yuanzhang who went from being an orphaned from a destitute peasant family to the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty. His rise to power took about 11 years. Summarized in list form: 

So I found out from a post on skeptics:SE that when Yuri Gagarin landed from being the first human in space during the Vostok 1 mission, he parachuted down and landed in the Soviet Union near the Volga river on a farm. Wikipedia recounts it like this: 

Japan lost because they didn't have large petroleum resources nearby, and had to over-extend themselves. With sufficient petroleum, they would not have needed to expend into SE Asia, and thus would not have needed to attack the Americans in the Philippines and Pearl Harbor. There were technical differences abound, but really both Japan and the US had nearly equivalent technology. They lost because of over-extension and oil. 

Notes [1] Bayly, Christopher Alan. Indian society and the making of the British Empire. No. 2002. Cambridge University Press, 1988. [2] The best example of this is related to Tea, Opium, and the relationship between the British Empire and the Qing dynasty. According to [1], they learned how to do this within the Mogul Empire when expanding the British East India Company. It was also used in the African expansion. Because the Opium trade / wars are the easiest example, I will explain that. Around 1750 - 1800 the British were importing a lot of Tea from Qing China. The only payment that the Qing would accept was silver. Britain was importing so much Tea around 1790 that the trade deficit was causing economic problems. They sent George Macartney to negotiate new trading rules so that the British Empire could trade goods instead of silver, reducing the deficit. For a variety of reasons, the Qing refused and maintained the silver requirement.[3] The British tried a bunch of ways to get this to change, and during the Napoleonic wars the figured out that they could grow Opium in India and smuggle it into China. It turned out (not surprising to us today) that Opium smuggling was very profitable, and that once you get customers, the are fairly "loyal".[3] This smuggling went on for a while, until Opium use combined with a loss of silver bullion was causing economic hardship and social breakdown. The Qing dynasty responded by shutting down the Opium trade, which sparked the Opium wars. The Qing lost the Opium wars, and the British got a bunch of small colonies in China and were free to trade as they pleased.[3] The areas administered by the British (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Xiamen) were originally small villages, and they quickly became the wealthiest areas of China. Why? Because the wealth of the Chinese hinterland was flowing out of China through these port cities.[3] Over time, the colonial possessions were gaining not just wealth, but also power. The power of the British and other Europeans and Japan was increasing throughout China, while formally the Qing dynasty was still in control. The Qing Dynasty was a rich, powerful country. It was richer and had a better economy and a better educated elite in 1750 than any other part of the world. It took a long time for this society to crumble, and the elite understood what the British were doing, and some fought back. In contrast, Africans were already quite divided when the British were moving in. Compared with the Germans and French, the British tended to leave the existing power structure in place and extracted just the wealth of the local area (Indirect Rule? Protectorate? Shaka Zulu). The British in the late 1800s had several advantages: They were really good at conquering and administering colonies, they were rich and industrial. They knew how to extract the wealth of the colonies. [3] Lipman, Jonathan N., Barbara Molony, and Michael A. Robinson. Modern East Asia: An Integrated History. Pearson, 2011. 

Although the question is about France, that was an edit to narrow things down a bit. I can only offer an example for Castille in the 14th century. King Alfonso XI of Castille was crowned in 1332. It was not common to have coronation cerimonies in Castille, unlike France, where the sacred aspect of being a king was stronger than in the Iberian Peninsula at the time. However, decades of political turmoil favoured a more forceful imposition of the royal power. The codex "Libro de la Coronation" (Book of the Coronation) was written for this effect in order to establish a coronation ritual for the kingdom. It was influenced by such books as the "Ordo of Constantinople", where the coronation ritual was described. The coronation was divided into two parts: becoming a knight and being coronated. Each part happened at a different location. On the day of his crowning, the king was dressed in his royal robes and mounted a horse. There was a procession from his lodgings to the cathedral. The procession included all the important noble lineages and some less important ones that the king was trying to bring under his control. Only the nobles entered the cathedral, but the peasants participated in the decoration of the city, as was usual in royal celebrations (such as entering a town). Decorations used in royal celebrations included covering streets with plants and hanging quilts from windows. So, yes, peasants could attend, though there wouldn't be enough room within the cathedral for them to enter. They would see the procession, participate in banquets (royal weddings were known to include large portions of food to be prepared for the peasants). The king wanted the entire kingdom to witness the celebration, whether directly (seeing the coronation moment itself) or indirectly (participating in the festivities in general). However the most important thing, was that the nobility would pay him homage and be personally bound to his service. This was done through a communal banquet and the fact that, once coronated, king Alfonso XI knighted hundreds of nobles. EDIT The coronation was described in detail in the "Crónica de Alfonso Onceno". I have read elsewhere descriptions of royal entrances in towns, but I can't recall the title of the book. 

I personally don't like this question because it gives credence to racial theories. Scientifically speaking, there is more variation from individual to individual than there is between peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. Anyway, addressing your question: One theory I've heard is that King Phillip's war was the cause. The idea behind this theory is simple: When the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock in 1620, the Native Americans aided them in establishing themselves, and helped them not to starve, by teaching the pilgrims, people who had lived as refugees in the Urban Netherlands for a generation, to learn farming and survival skills. They even celebrated the first thanksgiving together. In New England, generally speaking, the contact between the Europeans and Natives Americans were more than cordial - there was intermarriage, and conversion to Christianity, and peaceful coexistence. The primary difference between the two populations was more one of lifestyle than one of race. By about 1670, the mixing of the two populations, combined with declining Native American populations and quality of life, set the stage for "King Phillips War" Supporting Source and Wikipedia links. The common narrative goes like this: Metacom, a Native American nicknamed "King Phillip" by the settlers, started attacking and slaughtering the colonial population. The English colonialist responded in kind, slaughtering the Native American population. Both sides killed whichever "enemy" they came across, including women and children. Persons of mixed heritage were victims of both sides. 5% of the settler and 40% of the Native American population died. The general slaughter led to well defined racial identities that didn't exist before the war, and set the stage for future separate ethnic trends in North America. There is, of course, an opposing theory presented in this book that the war was not about race at all, but was instead a civil war intended to increase British control of the region, which used "divide and conquer" strategies, split what was a unified community to increase colonial power. One results of the increase British control was marginalization of the Native population, and a stronger racial identity for the settlers.
