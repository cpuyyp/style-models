Assume an earthlike planet with less mass than Earth. The planet is super-habitable. It has shallow oceans, was geologically active but is now geologically inactive, the main continents are east-west and there are no north-south continental land masses like Africa and the Americas. The planet stopped being geologically active approximately two million years ago. Vulcanism ceased, i.e., no volcanoes. Continental drift stopped. Mountain building was halted. A planet with shallow ocean will have warm seas which pump enormous volumes of water vapour into the atmosphere leading to high rainfall globally. The mountain ranges have been ground down to effectively nothing soil erosion and water activity over the last two million years. Much of the shallow oceans has filled with silt and run-off soil. Water levels have risen to cover large areas of the mostly flattened continental land masses. Marshes and swamps are now the dominant land form. There will be areas where the free oceans still exist. It seems worthwhile to leave some vestiges of the planet's earlier environment. This adds to its plausibility. And it adds to the author's plausibility: I, the author, know one-environment planet aren't too likely. Note: there are some exceptions, but we don't need to worry about them. Because the planet is, was or has been super-habitable, there will be vast reserves of material to drive the food chain (this could be more difficult than this glibly suggestion; but it can simply be assumed it is so) though this may be mainly detritus feeding, which is much like swamp or marshland ecology anyway. This means there should be a rich flora and fauna on the planet which as it changes into Planet Marshlands adaptive changes and evolutionary pressures will adapt them to this environment. The above model is based on the super-habitable planet and is well worth your while to do some further research into to help build your planet. The Wikipedia entry linked above is a good starting point. There is a certain amount of pure hand-waving in this model for marshlands-only (well, almost) planet There is another putative model for a swamp environment planet, but that involves a super-Earth type of planet with high gravity and a rigid crust which suppresses mountain building, vulcanism, and continental drift. In this case, the high gravity would be the killer. No natural Earth humans could move around such a planet without lots of advanced technology. While this logically makes sense, it's the death knock for plausible fiction. 

The system is rigged. Worlds like this, where super-powered heroes slug it out with super-powered villains, and the world keeps resetting itself (apparently) are controlled and manipulated by even more powerful super-beings who have created the worlds. These worlds are effectively reality shows for audiences of higher dimensional beings who vicariously enjoy superhero adventures. The worlds, of course, have to be reset otherwise the stories would stop. Although if the ratings fall too low, the worlds will be either shut down or there is no need to keep resetting them. Basically the reason everything keeps going on and on the same is due to the fact that the whole world is set up to be that way. Its inhabitants have no choice but to keep on doing everything in their lives without any changes. 

This video sets out the basic problems with a 25 foot tall King Kong. This suggests a fifty foot tall King Kong will have even more obstacles. On the plus side, the video is amusing, informative, and mercifully brief. Of course, YMMV. A 25 foot tall Gorilla would weigh 60 tons and while his skeletal structure, his bones, and circulatory system could support this, his ability to move around would be severely limited. Let alone his ability to fight or jump around. Also, being a herbivore Kong would be spending most of his time simply eating plants. In fact, if he was eating the same proportion of his body weight that a normal gorilla does, this is one-eighth of its body weight per day, Kong would be eating 7.5 tons per day. It is easy to suspect Skull Island would have been stripped bare of its plant resources Because Kong is an island dweller, and because the ecology of the habitat affects the size of animals this will influence his size, in fact, the smaller habitat the smaller the animal. The dinosaurs, for example, which were huge, lived on very large continents. The remains of Pigmy Mammoths were on the islands where they had lived. So if Kong is giant gorilla and an island dweller, he must be a pigmy giant gorilla. 

Usually questions about space-whales are a steaming pile of pseudoscientific twaddle, however, this question confines itself to something sensible. The OP may congratulate himself. For the sake of scientific sanity, it is assumed that space-whales are otherwise whale-like creatures created by extremely advanced alien technological civilizations. Basically they are cyborg marine mammals equipped with environmental protection systems to enable them to survive in space, and a propulsion system for easy travel around the galaxy. The core question is essentially whether dying or dead whales "beaching" themselves on alien planets can be a source of life dissemination. Basically, panspermia by dead space-whales. So the question is would this work? Could life on a planet be initiated by the cells and tissues from a dead whale? The simple answer is no. Possibly the DNA from those cells might form the precursors to life on the planet, but this should be regarded as extremely improbable. So no. What is more probable to be a source of life on a planet is the microbiota carried by the space-whale's body. If microbes could become established in the planet's environment they could colonize the planet. However, there are caveats about the fact that these micro-organisms will be well adapted to the environment and ecology of the space-whale's body this will make it improbable, but not impossible, for dead space-whales to be the vectors for spreading life to otherwise lifeless planets. Possible, highly improbable. May life even grow inside the corpse without ever needing to go out? Sadly, no, even ten thousand ton dead space-whales don't last forever. Their tissues will either run out or break down to the point where the viable existence for any organisms living inside a dead space-whale will run out. Eventually the outside environment will break in, and the space-whale won't be anymore. So, for a short time, yes, but not in the long run. 

Frankly no. The idea of using gravitational waves as a medium of communications isn't bad of itself. At first glance, it does look like a good idea. The real problems are with transmitting and receiving gravitational waves. The typical source of gravitational waves is a pair of black holes colliding, but any moving masses will generate gravitational waves. However, the masses involved are of the order of stellar masses. usually many times the mass of the Sun. 

What is called "inertia dampening technology" is really a mechanism that keeps whatever is inside the "magic" container is always at relative rest with respective to the walls irrespective of changes of momentum, velocity, and acceleration is experienced by the container itself. This means its mechanism is more than a motion compensation field. Motion is a concept that's more slippery than is usually thought. What can be done with motion compensation (MC) containers? Jules Verne-type space guns, for starters, and lithobraking, i.e., stopping by crashing into the Moon and planets when you arrive at your destination. You could create the most spectacular fairground rises in human history. Crash into walls or the ground at hypersonic speed. Skydive without a parachute. Fall off mountains with impunity. Applications in the military are trivially obvious. Bullet-proofing, artillery-proof, possibly blast-proof, great of tank and battleship armour. Aircraft can be made bullet-, missile-, anti-aircraft-weapon-proof. Airliners can crash in perfect safety and everybody can walk away unscathed. You might be able to make indestructible pressure vessels too. The limiting factors will be ultimately the destructibility of the container itself and the materials out of which it is made. 

Start by building a super habitable planet because this will maximize the conditions for life and evolution. If anything is going to increase the probability of intelligence, then a super habitable planet will be the first requirement. This won't of itself guarantee the rise of intelligence (in absolute sense), but it will increase its probability. 

If by "seeing" you are talking about the capacity to visualize higher dimensional spaces. Because poor three dimensional creatures like ourselves live in a world of three dimensions of space and cannot observe anything with more spatial dimensions. Considering time as a fourth dimension can be neglected for this exercise. if it is possible, and this is by no means certain, to modify to order parts of the brain, then it is possible to genetically reorganize the visual cortex this might be adapted for the visualization of higher order spaces. In which case, it may be possible that people with modified visual cortices will be able to visualize 4d, 5d, 6d and 7d and possibly even higher dimensional spaces. If so, this make geometry a much easier branch of mathematics for them. Mathematicians can dealt with higher order spaces including infinite dimensional spaces in their equations as abstract qualities. Whether there is any empirical evidence that the capacity to visualize spaces leads to improved geometers is an open question. In theory, if we understood how the visual cortex worked, and knew how to modify it by genetic engineering to order, then creating people with higher dimensional visualization should be possible. But whether this will make better at geometry remains an open question. ADDENDUM: As point of clarification, this answer discusses genetic modification to the structure and function of the visual cortex. This should not be taken as an improvement in the actual perception of the spatial dimensions in which humans exist. Everything in their environment would be seen as spatially three dimensional. The improved visual cortex was always intended, in this answer, to be the platform with which people could be able to visualize, that is to say, through an act of imagination to conceptualize higher dimensional spaces.
