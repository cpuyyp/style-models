For some tournament $T$, let $\gamma(T)$ denote the cardinality of a smallest dominating set of $T$. Denote by $f(k)$ the minimum number of vertices of a tournament $T$ having $\gamma(T) = k$. From what I've been able to find, not much is known about $f$. We know $f(2) = 3, f(3) = 7$ and $f(4) = 19$. Past that we're lost. Results from Erdos and Szekeres-Szekeres showed that $$(k + 1) 2^{k - 2} - 1 \leq f(k) \leq (k - 1)^2 2^{k -1} C$$ (for suitable constant $C$) some 50 years ago, and I haven't any refinement of those bounds (except that $f(5) > 47$, showing the lower bound is not exact). I'm interested in the structural properties of a tournament $T$ of order $f(k)$ having $\gamma(T) = k$, but I can't find much except this paper : Domination and irredundance in tournaments and its references. Any references that describe $T$ would be helpful. In particular, I'm interested in the existence/non-existence of a constant $c$ that satisfies this statement for any $k$ (and for a large enough tournament) : 

How to choose a point uniformly from a convex polytope $P \subset [0,1]^n$ defined by some inequalities, Ax < b ? (Here A is an m-by-n matrix, x is n-by-1 and b is m-by-1.) I imagine that you could start with a uniformly chosen point in the cube and do some process to get a point with Ax < b. 

Then it as the 1D gauge theory has an action determined by an element of the classifying bundle $H^2(BG, \mathbb{Z})$. How is the action an element of the cohomology? 

There are many examples of q-series identities being proven by interpreting them as generating series of geometric invariants like the Donaldson invariants. I would like to know if there are ways of establishing congruences among the coefficients of theta functions or other q-series using geometric invariants. As an example, here's one relating SO(3) Donaldson invariants and mock theta functions. Here's another one involving McMahon's enumeration of plane partitions. These deal with infinite products or series. I'd like to know if physical or geometric methods have been used to prove congruences My naive opinion is that since physics deals mostly with "real" spaces, there's no way to get the "torsion" involved in number theory. EDIT: Perhaps what I ask asking for is much simpler. Are there number-theoretic congruences among invariants in topology or geometry? Examples might be Bott periodicity or Adams' theorem on the # of independent vector fields on spheres. 

In other words, pick any $k - c$ vertices. Then there's some smallest dominating set that contains them. This doesn't hold for $c = 0$, but it makes intuitive sense that it does for $c = 1$. However, I'm not even close to showing this is true for some constant, neither that there there is a $c$ for which the statement holds for every $k$, but for at least one smallest tournament with domination number $k$. 

The following greedy algorithm should reconstruct the tree corresponding to a given distance matrix $M$, assuming it exists. Beforehand, one must show that $T$, if it exists, is unique, but unless you insist I will skip these details (informally, you can use induction on $n$: from a tree $T$ for $M$, remove a leaf $l$, use induction to get the unique tree for $M$ with the $l$ row/column removed, then show that there is only one unique place to plug back $l$). 

Say we have a labeled, binary unrooted tree $T$, i.e. each node has either 1 or 3 neighbors. Denote by $L(T)$ the set of leaves (degree-one nodes) of $T$. For some $L \subseteq L(T)$, denote by $t(L)$ the smallest subtree of $T$ containing $L$. That is, $t(L)$ is the minimal (in terms of nodes) connected induced subgraph of $T$ that contains $L$. A $k$-partition $P = \{L_1, \ldots, L_k\}$ of $L(T)$ is called valid if for any distinct $L_i, L_j \in P$, $t(L_i)$ and $t(L_j)$ are vertex-disjoint. The question is : how many valid $k$-partitions of $L(T)$ does $T$ have ? Denote by $p(T)$ the number of such partitions. I'd like to know if this problem is known/has been addressed previously. I'd be happy with lower and upper bounds on $p(T)$. I'd also like to know if the structure of $T$ is relevant, or is $p(T)$ only dependent on $|L(T)|$ ? NOTE : this originates from this thing called the Perfect Phylogeny Problem, which has been studied for some time - but no one seems to have bothered with counting $p(T)$. 

René Thom proved that two closed $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$ are (unoriented) cobordant iff their Stiefel-Whitney numbers agree: for any partition $i_1 + \dotsb + i_k = n$, $$[M]\frown w_{i-1}(M)w_{i_2}(M)\dotsm w_{i_k}(M) = [N]\frown w_{i-1}(N)w_{i_2}(N)\dotsm w_{i_k}(N).$$ The mod 2 Euler characteristic is a Stiefel-Whitney number: $\chi(M)\bmod 2 = [M]\frown w_n(M)$. Thus, if $M$ and $N$ are unoriented cobordant, then their Euler characteristics differ by a multiple of 2. (There might be a more direct proof of this using handles.) You can get rid of the mod 2 assumption if you work with (stably almost) complex cobordism, equipping all manifolds and cobordisms with a complex structure on the stable normal bundle. (In particular, this determines an orientation of your manifold.) Milnor and Novikov showed that $M$ and $N$ are complex cobordant iff their Chern numbers agree: these are defined in the same way as Stiefel-Whitney numbers, but for Chern classes. The Euler characteristic is a Chern number: $\chi(M) = [M]\frown c_n(M)$ if $M$ is $2n$-dimensional, and $\chi(M) = [M]\frown 0$ if $M$ is odd-dimensional. Thus in any dimension, the Euler characteristic is a cobordism invariant for stably almost complex cobordism. 

where $q$-Catalan numbers are shown to enumerate invariants related to the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points on $\mathbb{C}^2$ (which respect to an equivariant torus action). There are clearly some vector spaces related to the $q$-catalan numbers Gorsky has $q,t$ Catalan numbers and just set $t = 1$ ( I am looking for the correct degeneration). I do not underestand why $(q,t)$-enumeration is so trendy, as one could have arbitrary deformations. My double-use of the letter $q$ is a bit suspect since $q$ could be: 

How is $H_1(\mathbb{C}\backslash\{ 0,1,x\}, L^*)$ different from $H_1(\mathbb{C}\backslash\{ 0,1,x\})$ ? 

Thus we get a sphere-filling curve. The images supplied in Thurston's paper do not convince me they fill the sphere. 

Far as I can tell... Hex is a "Princeton" phenomenon. It originated in their Math department as invented by John Nash / Piet Hein. The game is not widely available (but these days with Amazon, relatively easy to find). And... there's not much activity now (in favor of of games like Scrabble or Checkers or Mancala). 

The manifold $P(m,n) := (S^m\times \mathbb{CP}^n)/(\mathbb Z/2)$, where $\mathbb Z/2$ acts by the antipodal map on $S^m$ and by complex conjugation on $\mathbb{CP}^n$, is called a Dold manifold. In "Erzeugende der Thomschen Algebra $\mathfrak N$", Dold computes the mod 2 cohomology, Steenrod module structure, and Stiefel-Whitney classes of $P(m,n)$. The calculations are fairly straightforward, and I found them to be a good example when I was learning Stiefel-Whitney classes and wanted more examples than projective spaces. The paper is in German, but it's nonetheless quite readable, especially with a dictionary. 

In dimension 4, the Todd genus does not depend on the choice of a symplectic structure or even on an almost complex structure. If $M$ is an almost complex 4-manifold, then $\langle c_1(M)^2, [M]\rangle = 2\chi(M) + 3\sigma(M)$ (see here, p. 9), and $\langle c_2(M), [M]\rangle = \chi(M)$; here $\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of $M$ and $\sigma(M)$ is its signature. Thus any orientation-preserving diffeomorphism preserves the Todd genus, and the orientation-preserving assumption is necessary, because the signature depends on the choice of orientation. This is also mentioned at the end of §2 of this paper by Łukasz Bąk. 

This result is not obvious (although Pak's proof is short). However, any explicit collection of sets I build such that three of them intersect, have a clear total intersection. How about this simpler result, also from Pak's book: 

If we set $\eta = 0$ and $\tau = -1$, theorem 1 says if $H_0$ is ``majorana reflection positive" then: $$ \rho_P = \mathrm{Tr} \prod_{k=1}^M e^{-\tau H_0} = \det \left( I + \prod_{k=1}^M e^{-\tau h^0} \right)$$ However, it's ambiguous what to put for $H_0$ or $h^0$, possibly eq (10). 

If I understood my automorphic forms correctly, at least cusp forms can be thought of as elements of $L^2(G/\Gamma)$ for a $G = \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $\Gamma = \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ or a suitable congrence subgroup. I want to know if there is an analogous result for hyperbolic-3 space modulo a Bianchi group. For example: $$ \mathbb{H}^3 \,/\, \text{PSL}_2 \big(\mathbb{Z}[i] \big) $$ This is a group action by isometries. They inherit from this action of the full group: \begin{eqnarray*} \text{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times \mathbb{H}^3 &=& \mathbb{H}^3\\ (g,z) &=& \frac{az+b}{cz+d} \end{eqnarray*} In this case, is there a version of modular forms (or cusp forms) here? I have never seen a discussion of modular forms over quaternionic arguments. I suppose the method of images could produce an invariant function: $$ f(z) = \sum_{\gamma \in \text{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[i])} f_0( \gamma \, z) $$ I am hoping or something more explicit. Is there an analog of theta function or newform in this setting? My guess this should be an element of the space $L^2(G/\Gamma)$ that I have constructed. $$ f_0(a+bi+cj+dk) = e^{2\pi i \, (a^2 + b^2+c^2 + d^2)} = q^{z \overline{z}} $$ This is just a speculation. Certainly this will be invariant but it won't be in $L^2$. 

I'm trying to find generating manifolds for the cobordism group $\mathit{MO}_5(K(\mathbb Z/2, 2))\cong (\mathbb Z/2)^4$, which can be represented as the cobordism group of closed 5-manifolds $M$ together with a class $B\in H^2(M;\mathbb Z/2)$. I've found three of the four generators; the fourth should be a 5-manifold $M$ such that $w_1(M)w_2(M)\in H^3(M;\mathbb Z/2)$ is nonzero, and here I've gotten stuck. Such an $M$ cannot be a product of lower-dimensional manifolds, nor can it be the total space of a fiber bundle over the circle. I'm happy to hear general approaches or ideas as well, such as ways of modifying a manifold to change its cohomology or Stiefel-Whitney classes in useful ways. 

There's an interesting application of stable homotopy theory to condensed-matter physics, and it makes heavy use of integral and torsion information, contradicting your 4th assumption. Within the general program of understanding topological phases of matter, condensed-matter theorists are interested in symmetry-protected topological phases (SPT phases). Approximately speaking, these are systems which have interesting topological behavior in the presence of a symmetry, but become trivial when that symmetry is broken. Their classification has gradually gotten more homotopical: 

This formula suggests $$ \chi(\mathrm{Sym}^l[C]) = \binom{l -1+ \chi(C)}{l} = \chi \binom{l-1 + C }{l} $$ where the right hand side is some "categorification". Removing the $\chi$'s, is there some sense in which $$ \mathrm{Sym}^l[C] = \binom{l -1+ C }{l} $$ is rigorous? 

There's a relation between Associahedra and noncrossing partitions as outlined in this paper: Rational associahedra and noncrossing partitions Sloane Encylopedia has along list of facts about Catalan Numbers Wait. These are not higher dimensional. 

The definition in [GK] should agree with what I've discussed before, I've practically outlined what it should be. It is a weighted sum over various "acceptable" . If we choose $A$ correctly and the weights $C_{ijk}$ and $g_{ij} = C_{ik}^l C_{jl}^k$, then perhaps we get a count of the domino tilings. 

Edelman and Kostlan count solutions for Gaussian random polynomials in a geometric way via the Crofton formula. We are counting the number of intersections of a curve on the sphere with a random hyperplane. Finding the zero of a polynomial is like showing two vectors are orthogonal: $$ \sum a_n z^n = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) \cdot (1, z, z^2, \dots, z^n) = 0 $$ where $z \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\vec{a} \in \mathbb{R}P^{n+1}=S^n$. The Gaussian joint distribution of coefficients amounts to the uniform distribution $\vec{a}$ on the sphere. The Crofton formula says your expected number of real zeros in an interval is equal to the arc length of your curve projected onto the sphere. $$N_f = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_I \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} \log [v(x)\cdot v(y) ]\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}_{x=y=t}dt $$ The Edelman-Kostlan paper has a version of this function for $\mathbb{C}$. For iid Gaussian coefficients, Peres-Virag work this out to be $\rho(z) = \frac{1}{(1 - |z|^2)^2}$ in the limit that the degree gets large. At least you can see a concentration around the unit circle $|z| = 1$.
