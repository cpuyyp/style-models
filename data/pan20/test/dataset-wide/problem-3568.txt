For strength training, you should always do full-range of motion (ROM) push-ups. Partial ROM exercises are appropriate only for intermediate or advanced lifters who need to fix a problem area in a weighted exercise where recovering from doing the full ROM would be problematic. (For instance, deadlifting an enormous amount of weight can take a week to recover from, so an elite deadlifter might do rack pulls one day and halting deadlifts another.) Since push-ups are not a weighted exercise, the recovery is not going to be an issue, and so there's no reason not to train the full ROM. If one is so weak as to be unable to do a single push-up, bench pressing a broomstick or light bar across the whole range of motion would be superior to doing partial ROM push-ups, since the muscle will then get stronger across the full ROM. Training the partial ROM will not get one strong enough to do the full ROM. There may be other reasons to train partial-ROM push-ups, such as mass/hypertrophy or conditioning. It seems that for both of these goals there are superior methods: running, a Prowler or boxer's speed bag for endurance, and various presses for hypertrophy. It does not seem that partial-ROM push-ups are particularly useful except when one does not have access to more suitable equipment. 

Counting is generally best for keeping rhythm when lifting. You can say the numbers out loud, murmur them, shout or grunt them, or just count in your head. 

Lean back while the bar is at the bottom. Squeeze your whole trunk, particularly the glutes. Push the bar straight up. As soon as possible, lean forward and get your head under the bar. At the top, you lock it out slightly behind your head. This image from the book makes everything clear: 

Strength and conditioning coach Kelly Baggett espouses a bodybuilding-style approach for short-term gains: 

Doing push-ups every day is fine. Don't overdo them. Do other things too, like squats and lunges and pull-ups and Hindu push-ups and sprints. The advice you're reading is not geared towards all situations and is not applicable to just doing a few push-ups. 

The goal here is not weight loss. You can lose weight by chopping an arm off or donating a kidney. What you want is to be healthier, look better, and lose fat. The term for this is body recomposition, that is, changing out body to be composed of more muscle and less fat. You can't out-gym a bad diet "You can't outrun a bad diet", the old saying goes, which means that almost no amount of exercise can help someone who eats lots of bad food. As Dr. Yoni Freedhoff puts it: 

I sweat a lot. When my grip slips because of sweat, I blame the sweat and not the bar. This approach works pretty well. I wear sweat-bands on my wrists and carry chalk. I wipe the sweat from both sides of my hands onto a towel or my shirt, then chalk my palms copiously. This keeps my grip mostly dry.

Holding your breath is common, standard, well-accepted powerlifting practice. Hold your breath throughout each rep of squatting, deadlifting, and pressing. Holding your breath helps keep your chest locked. Breathing during the rep encourages you to move your chest, meaning you lose the tightness in your abs, upper and lower back. This invites injury. For instance, I was blasting through a good set of deadlifts, but pulled a muscle in my back when I let myself breath out on the way up. If you feel like you need to let your breath out in the middle of a rep, sometimes you have to dump the bar and lose the rep. (Other times you can grind it out.) The Mayo Clinic is wrong. I assume, since they do not give reasons or evidence for their claim that holding one's breath is dangerous, that they think that holding one's breath while lifting could cause some sort of stroke or aneurysm. See pages 50-54 in Starting Strength 2nd edition for a discussion of why this is incorrect, where, among other things, it is noted that 

If you're overhead pressing as much as you're deadlifting, either something is wrong (like a deadlift-preventing injury) or you're not challenging your deadlift. The way humans are built make them able to lift more--a lot more--with some lifts than with others. So yes, the ratios between different lifts matters in StrongLifts. If you look around, you can even find articles where the author of the program describes why his program doesn't work with just a single pair of dumbbells. The central tenet of the program is not "this lift, then that lift, yadda yadda yadda", it's "lift X pounds today, rest a day, then lift X+5 pounds". The concept of linearly progressing a small number of fundamental lifts is way more important than what those lifts are or what the rep scheme is. In a deeply fundamental way, StrongLifts is adding weight every session, which you can't do if you just lift 36kg every time. 

You're going to experience novice gains almost no matter what you do, so expect that the first six weeks or so will be great. If the CrossFit gym is properly run, you'll get stronger and better at not getting tired. CrossFit varies greatly from gym to gym ("box" to "box"), but the basic formula is generally constant: basic gymnastics, power- and Olympic lifting, and metabolic conditioning (in the form of running, pull-ups, kettlebells, and all manner of other exercises). All of these involve a degree of strength and "endurance" work, so you'll probably see the improvements you're looking for. You'll probably do fine just splitting up the workouts: CrossFit/martial arts/CrossFit/martial arts. It won't much matter if you mess up the rhythm until you've been at it several months and your progress starts to level off. At that point, you'll probably want to develop or find some structured strength programming. (Most CrossFit gyms can help you with that.)
