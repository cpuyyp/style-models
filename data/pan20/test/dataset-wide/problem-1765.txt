Yes, it is possible. You can edit the settings of the vm and add a new disk or an existing disk. However, your guest OS need to do a rescan to discover the disk and use it. So it is a multiple-step process. 

There should be no expected issues just from running this command (otherwise the man page will be full of dire warnings for sure). If things die, then it would not be due to atime update turned off, but some hardware problems you have. that remount simply turns off the atime updates and will thus have LESS disk usage and therefore make things less likely to die. Have done this sort of things many times and never see any issue. If you are still concerned and if you can later restart the system or mysql, you certainly can do so. 

Use the command runlevel to find what is the run level, which is the number before on or off. So if your run level is 2, you can grep 2:on from the above output and find all the services that are on. Usually run level is set in /etc/inittab, but can be changed. 

In the same shell it will not work. Try to put the ulimit setting in you .bashrc of root, login as root again and try. You can verify with ulimit -a to verify. 

is the certificate self-signed or signed by CA? if the former you need to generate a new one, and if the latter you should contact your vendor CA support. or you just have to purchase a new one from some vendor if you do need a CA-signed one. 

Port can be reassigned to confuse people etc., so if you have a plain http server actually listening on port 443 then your http url should work, and vice versa. However the restriction you are facing may be more than just the port. Since ssl and http are different protocols, it is trivial to figure out that the packets are not http and your connection is thus blocked. It is probably easier to do ssl tunneling if your http traffic in this case. 

I have a couple servers at Linode. I'm trying to set them up so I have a VPN into one of the machines and can then access all the other machines using the private linode network. Public access to private services (SSH, etc.) would then be restricted to only those who have VPN access. Note: I have no firewalls running on these servers yet. 

So we have a few servers that are running Lucid and will be running apache/php. We would like to be able to run PHP scripts as different systems users as well as have customized php.ini files for said users. I did some reading on using fast-cgi with suexec, which looked like it might work, but then came accross php-fpm. Did some research on that and php 5.3.3 has just been released with php-fpm built in. So, my immediate need is to get 5.3.3 on Lucid. My long-term need is to have a mechanism whereby we can get regular PHP updates on Lucid. I have seen on launchpad that there is a 5.3.3 release for Maveric. However, my concern about using sources from a newer release is that there are going to be dependency issues. So, it seems to me that taking the source files from Maveric and compiling them on Lucid and then putting those debs in a PPA is a valid idea. But the whole launchpad/ppa/packaging thing is currently over my head and I would rather not spend the time looking into all of that if its not the best way to proceed. So, two primary questions: 1) What is the best way to get regular PHP updates in Lucid? 2) If the answer to the first question is anything like I outlined above (pull source package from later releases, compile, push to PPA), how would I get started on something like that for PHP? Thanks in advance. 

Yes you can and it is possible to install this. To verify it you can download an eval copy and try it. 

can you at least download the zone files? that is actually all you need. if you cannot even do that, you would have to use dig or another client to go through all the records that you know to find information, that would be painful. 

even within the same minor version, there are different kernel updates so definitely you can stay 5.4 and update your kernel. how did you compile the drivers? unless you have used dkms (search for that), you will have to recompile if you upgrade the kernel. there is something called ksplice which may do what you want. search for that again for details. it dynamically patches a running kernel to block vulnerabilities. 

I did a google search (I know that does not provide the answer per se) on the linux kernel mailing list site, but the entries found seem to indicate that it is more or less something harmless. not sure if any entry actually applies to your case, but you can take a quick look at the search result of: local_softirq_pending site:lkml.org 

disclaimer: you should read lvm manual carefully and understand what each step does. however, there should be very little risk unless you encounter errors. this is what I do usually i this case. if there is a chance that someone else might do something to mess you up, you want to block any login while doing the maintenance (touch /etc/nologin etc. per your maintenance procedure and company policy). pvmove /dev/md3 # make sure all used extents are moved away pvs -o+pv_used # make sure that no extents are used in /dev/md3 vgreduce vg1 /dev/md3 # now remove the physical volume 

So, I think based on the above, when I ping 172.20.1.1, my server should send the packets to 192.168.137.64 (internal server). That server should, because of ip forwarding, take the packet from eth0:1 and route it to tun0 (172.20.1.1). But, as you might have guessed, pinging 172.20.1.1 from nix03 (db server) does not work. I did some packet capturing to see which MAC address my ICMP packets were getting sent to: 

And that tells me the packets should be getting to the internal server. At least, they are being sent to the right NIC. However, when I run tcpdump on eth0 and eth0:1 of the internal server, I don't see any icmp packets coming in from the db server. What else can I try? Thanks in advance. Update #1 Routing table for "internal" server: 

WOW!, just did another google search and came across a guy who mentioned AVG. A light went off and I completely disabled my AVG and the problem disappeared. Further testing showed the problm is with the LinkScanner functionality. I had considered AVG early on, but since I don't have the internet security version, I assumed it would not have an impact. I very much regret that assumption! 

I ended up having to add a NAT rule to the internal server. I'm not sure its necessary, but it is what worked: 

Current problem I want to be able to hit the database server through the VPN. From my vpn client (laptop at my office), I'd like to be able to ping 192.168.137.63. However, that currently fails. In my attempts to troubleshoot, I decided to approach it from the db server side and see if I could ping the VPN tunnel on the internal server (172.20.1.1). I realized that I would need to setup a route on the database server to tell it where to send packets destined for the 172.20.1.0/24 network, so I did that: 

I'm working with postfix on fedora 9 and I'm attempting to make some changes to a system setup by my predecessor. Currently the postfix server on [mail.ourdomain.com] is setup to forward mail sent to two addresses to another server for processing. The other server [www01.ourdomain.com] receives the email and sends it to a PHP script to be processed. Then that PHP script generates and sends a response to the user who sent the original email. We're adding more web servers to the system and as a result we've decided to move these processing scripts to our admin [admin.ourdomain.com] server to make them easier to keep track of. I've already setup and tested the processing scripts on [admin.ourdomain.com], and on the mail server doing the forwarding [mail.ourdomain.com] I added [admin.ourdomain.com] to /etc/hosts and also added another, aside from the one for [www01.ourdomain.com], entry to /etc/postfix/transport for [admin.ourdomain.com]. I also restarted postfix as well. I've tested the communication from [mail.ourdomain.com] to [admin.ourdomain.com] using telnet and the [admin.ourdomain.com] domain and everything runs correctly. But as soon as I change the forward address and attempt to send an email to the mail server I get a bounce message stating "Host or domain name not found. Name service error for name=admin.ourdomain.com type=A: Host not found". If I change the forward settings back to [www01.ourdomain.com] then everything works fine. Is there some setting I'm missing in Postfix? The server itself and telnet work fine it just seems to be postfix that's not able to discover the location of [admin.ourdomain.com]. 

On two of our servers we have an Ubuntu LAMP setup with PHP code designed to allow large image and audio uploads. One of our clients is having an issue where they are unable to upload any files larger than ~4MB from any computer in their office. They get a "The connection was reset" this error in FireFox and in chrome they get "Error 101 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET): Unknown error." In chrome I can watch the upload percentage and see the upload fail around the time ~4MB is reached (53%) on an 7.79MB file. It's not a speed issue as I've successfully uploaded files from slower networks. Apache is returning no errors in the logs, and is recording the start of the post in the access log. The PHP.ini is set to allow files up to 500MB and we have other clients doing this with no problems. I've upped the script timeouts of PHP as well. I've tested uploading from a number of other locations to the servers with no errors; and I've also tested uploading from the clients location to other services, also with no errors. I'm really at a loss i can't tell if it's a server error a client and I'm hoping someone might know of something I can use to test or perhapses possibly a setting I might have missed. 

yeah, in ovf export (File -> Export). not sure if it is a good idea to save to usb directly, as usb i/o is often iffy. it is better to save to your hd and then copy. done many many times with no issues. 

It certainly could, but automatic reboot is usually associated with hardware/software issues such as overheating or kernel bugs. So it is possible that heavy load causes overheat which leads to reboot. In any event, you should investigate the log or kernel dumps to find the exact cause. 

Quite sometime back, I have worked with servers in some ISP where I can access via ftp/sshfs etc, but no interactive shell access, to the server. One workaround they have is to allow you to set up a cron/at job via a web interface, or a copy of crontab file that you can edit, that will invoke scripts/commands. Ask the administrator if that is possible, if interactive shell absolutely cannot be granted. 

Only is expecting a shell command to be executed, not a condition like what you have, which should be a case instead. 

Virtualbox and vmplayer will do also. Xen is another. For guest os you might want to start either with jeos or one of the minimal ubuntu isos. You can easily find all these. 

I have used this and it does support it, not sure if it is builtin or it is a custom field, as it was a couple of years ago in a different company. $URL$ it has 30 day free trial. 

The order should be the same of zip. So if you can control the zip process, then you can order the file addition as you please and unzip should come out in that order. If you do not do the zip yourself, then you would have to unzip them to the file system and reorder as there is not an easy way to order them. If you really want to avoid create temporary files, you can use something like
