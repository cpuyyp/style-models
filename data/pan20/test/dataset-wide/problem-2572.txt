There is no problem at all. It will have mixed result (if casue is really mixed) or each action will have it's own result (selling liquor - bad, generosity - good). Amount of the result is not just lineraly depend on the amount of action, it's also depend on the level of development of mind of the performer. There is more factors to play in the ripening of karma. 

Answer is greatly depend on what communism is. There is many opinions on communism, and in the course of history it have appropriated many unfortunate misconceptions (like vulgar atheism and dialectical materialism). I would define communism as idea of scientifically improving humanity (society as a whole and each person in particular). This most general idea does not contradict with Buddhism. Improving society is barely touched in Buddhism, but improving persons is. Alas, actual communist traditions have accepted ideas that really contradict Buddhism. For example, Leninism state that 'everything that is good for working class is moral'. That is directly contradictory to Buddhist discipline. Also, curious quote from Dalai Lama: 

In no way alaya-vijnana is "eternal, unchanging". This is Buddhism after all and nobody will posit totally non-buddhistic concepts which could contradict basic teachings of Buddha. Unenlightened beings may mistakenly perceive alaya-vijnana as Soul, but they may perceive so about any skandha. (One interpretation of why skandhas are five is that it's five assumptions of Self.) Standard analogy for alaya-vijnana is violent current of a river (udakaugha), it may be perceived as solid (from a far) but it's highly changing (if looked closer). Alaya-vijnana is only remains to the end of sansara. 

To state such judgement would be to intentionally contradict with Christianity. I believe there is no internal (teaching needs) nor external (societal) need for such judgement. Thus, it's highly doubtful that any big council would make such statement, and even more doubtful that it will be 'official for all Buddhists'. No council can prescript official opinion obligatory for all Buddhists of Earth. Because Buddhist community is not centralized/autocratic but pluralistic. Any council that will try to enforce dogma will just split community on who accept it and who is not. 

First, it's important to understand, that it is not logically follows that if something is more worthwhile than lesser goal is discouraged. Acquiring lesser merits is not discouraged. Only bad deeds are discouraged. Second, motivation is also play very important role, see AN 7.49. And yes, merit (positive karmic fruits) of the action is also dependent on its nature, and merit of giving depend on the object of that giving, see AN 9.20. Giving is meritorious deed, so helping poors is still meritorious deed. 

While habits are part of the workings of karma, it is not reasonable to say that what you described (habit to fight leads to beating) is Buddhist notion of karma. It may be correct other way around, though—some unwholesome karma is ripening while you exercise habit to fight. Karma is similar to idiom "you reap what you sow" but with some added complexity. What you will reap is not need to be the same or feel the same as what you sow. In Buddhist concept of karma, unwholesome actions, when sown, will certainly reap into unwholesome fruits. What will be reaped is not mirror of what is sown, but it is consequence of what was sown. So when you sow action that should result in suffering, you will reap suffering for sure. 

This is one of classifications of paramartha dharmas. In (most) expanded form they also known as dharma lists. There is many variations in these lists between traditions. Sometimes traditions differ in content (if some element should be included in the list or not), sometimes in status of elements in there. Probably all four categories have difference in some or another tradition. 

A lie is directly supporting ignorance. And an ignorance is directly supporting all defilements (it's present in all of them), which directly supporting all type of evil deeds. It's usual that weight of deeds is greatly misperceived by common people in compare to Buddha. Mental deeds are most important in consequences. And deliberate lie, probably, does most damage to a mind. It's said that Bodhisatta in previous lives could do all evil, except lie. 

To rely on expiration of karma is probably even wrong view, because it is conductive to lack of right effort to do wholesome actions that actually improve karma. Also, without right effort you'll continue to produce bad karma so there is no exhaust in this case. 

Higgs Boson is a concept. And, as with any concept, we can invent into concepts any idea whatsoever, with any property we can imagine. What is constructed (and thus empty) in Higgs Boson is it's conceptuality, the way how that knowledge is reached. 

You are right in that anatman is a view, not just a doctrine. Anatman is phenomenological view, where phenomena are dharmas. Once you properly acquire that ultimate view, you just don't see a place for Atman to be. Because everything is covered by dharmas. And the view by itself is sound. In comparison to phenomenological anatman view, view of atmavada is metaphysical. It is based on imagination and doubtful inference. Which is not sound base for views and actions. Additionally, from methodological perspective, atmavada leads to unwholesome deeds and, thus, suffering. So it's not useful and not profitable to hold such a view. 

Two truths is not just Mahayana development, it's Abhidharma (Abhidhamma) development, and exists in Theravada too (check this (pdf) excellent article of prof. Karunadasa). But "relative and absolute" is really misnomer, properly said it's conventional and ultimate truths (skt. samvriti & paramartha satya). Their distinction is like between naïve language (convention) and scientific analytical discourse. When language is used in its common sense it's conventional, and when it express Buddhist teaching it's truth. When reality as it is, is analysed into dharmas and expressed in special dharma-discourse (adhidharma), it is ultimate truth. Typical example is: when Buddhist teaching talks about beings it's conventional truth, when it talk about skandhas it's ultimate truth. 

Hirakawa probably only meant that "classification of dharmas into conditioned and unconditioned" is found in the Agamas, not that space were considered to be unconditioned dharma "is found in the Agamas". Conditionality of space (akasa) was controversial topic even inside of Sarvastivada. If it would be mentioned to be non-conditional anywhere inside of Agamas (i.e. in sutras, as in 'Buddha's words') it would not be that controversial subject. 

This is two things. Plain idea of 'evolution' supposes progress and positive development of species. Buddhists probably should not hold such position, as species could regress as result of bad karma. And about 'natural selection' part, why not? Idea of selection, natural or not, doesn't coincide or contradict idea of karma. Idea of genetic engineering either. 

On the other hand, how Enlightenment is not producible by tanha? Function of tanha is to drag us into next birth. Thus, relying on tanha we can not expect next birth to be Enlightenment, we can not rebirth into arhats. 

There is different level of depth and scientifical strictness in understanding of even mundane causal relations. One of main differences of pratityasamutpada from causality in general is its phenomenological context. Pratityasamutpada work between the dharmas. Meaning of teaching of pratitaysamutpada according to Asanga: 

Degree of consequences is not established by the law of karma, only wholesomeness of them. Check this fine sutta AN 3.99. 

Actions are considered as having beginning, middle and end. And determinant is their end, sometimes called fruit (phala) or result (vipaka). I.e., wholesome (or good) actions in Buddhism are these that lead to pleasant or happy experience as their final result, and unwholesome (or bad) actions are these that lead to pain and suffering. Action that is unpleasant at the beginning still could lead to happiness and thus considered wholesome. Example is unpleasant meditation. Action that is pleasant at the beginning, easily could lead to the suffering as final result. To determine results of action need some sort of knowledge and wisdom (prajna). Otherwise action is conditioned by ignorance (vipaka-avidya) and commonly lead to suffering. Good detailed article Kusala and Akusala as Criteria of Buddhist Ethics, Bhikkhu Thich Nhat-Tu. 

"Historical" is fact established by historical science. Even historical existence of Shakyamuni is debated. There is no other historical buddhas besides Shakyamuni. That is other buddhas are present to us only as mythological characters. 

Karma is of course accumulated. But other factors play much more important role in it's ripening than exhausting of accumulations. Our actions in this life and (impossible to control) thoughts at the last moments of life are usually much more determinant to next birth than expiration of karma or merit. See quotation from Abhidharmasamuccaya: 

We can only propose taxonomy. Plus there is many misuse of the terms. This is how I view things: school (vada) - It's supposed to be school of thought, so school adherents should share common philosophical view. Probably in ancient times they was. But in modern practice, frequently, any group united by common root is called a school. sect - sometimes people divide whole Religion into sects, but sometimes they call schools sects. Plus, term inherited from Christianity some negative connotations of heresy. Thus, sometimes word 'sect' is not liked at all. branch - just general division which is not loaded term as a sect. For example, we can split whole Buddhism into branches (Tibetan, Chinese, etc), but also we can split some tradition into branches (Tibetan into Gelug, Kagyu, etc., or Kagyu into Karma Kagyu, Drikung Kagyu, etc.) It's general classification word like 'part', 'subdivision', etc. tradition - what is survived (or evolved) to modern day from ancient ages. It's probably region based. But in practice interchangeable with sect or school too. vehicle (yana) - some theoretical division of the Teaching, used by Buddha in some texts. It's more abstract division than real historical entity. Only historical we have about vehicles is attribution of some texts to vehicles and acceptance or not by some schools of these texts as canonical. lineage - supposedly unbreaked personal inheritance of some teaching, or student-teacher relationships, from ancient to modern teacher (frequently lineage goes up to the Buddha himself). vinaya lineage - historically is more important than adherence to philosophy, it's unbreaked succession of ordinance into Sangha by the rules for particular vinaya. Currently only three vinaya lineages are survived. What else? 

Non-Mahayana Theravada Buddhists* aspire to become arahants. So, are they discouraged from performing wholesome karma to accumulate merit (puñña)? Probably not. Lay-following is not discouraged while there is still higher goal. Mahayana distinctive feature is acceptance of all teachings of Buddha. So from Mahayana perspective non-Bohisattva teachings and practices are integral part of Dharma and possible for some types of personalities. But, if person aspire to become budhisattva/buddha he probably should abstain from intent of leaving samsara to nirvana, but not from intent of reaching enlightenment (bodhi). He may wish to become enlightened bodhisattva, or even buddha. 

(Implied question) Is it contradictory to stop tanha with tanha? No, as already mentioned, Brahmana Sutta confirms. Tanha is stoppable factor, if it's done in proper way. Cause of tanha is ignorance (avijja) which is stoppable factor either. Additional quotes from R. Morrison article: 

It's not supposed to be that way. Tanha is neutral factor (in a sense that it will not necessarily cause evil deeds). Tanha is also always and everywhere present factor in non-englihtened beings. And tanha is quite complicated notion to define, so, it's rarely used directly as is (in the Abhidhamma). Instead, it's used in derived terms, like lobha, raga, etc. But, tanha could present itself not just as unwholesome roots (lobha, desa, moha), but also as factor of enlightenment (chanda). 

If you deny just one link, that should not make other 10 links of no value even for you. In Sarvastivada school there is also instantaneous (ksanika) interpretation of pratityasamutpada. Quoting Abhidharmakosa-bhasya: 

Because other laws serve their purpose and karma law is law of nature. So, to acquire our goals we establish our laws. With established laws we don't try to replace law of karma. 

Some traditions, schools, teachers, could incite you to take bodhisattva vow(s) as sort of basic thing. But this is their particular teaching and not general Mahayana requirement. Because Mahayana suppose diversity of teaching for different types of personalities. Mahayana, I repeat, is not some unified school, but very very broad notion including any and all types of Buddha's teaching for any types of beings. Some personality may not have courage to have bodhicitta intent and of course she/he will not be pushed out from vehicle of maha-yana. 

Platform sutra describes 'non-symbolic repentance' as including sincere promise to never repeat faults in the future, and acknowledgement of our past faults, that are caused by defilements of mind (ignorance, pride, and envy), which we decide to clean off our thoughts for good.
