You want an archaeology text book, giving that civilisation (the living in cities) predates literacy. 

The other clue is in "French politicians represented special-interest groups, particularly middle-class ones." where classes are depicted as (primarily) segmented interest groups. Not as relations to production, but as ideas groups. We can assume that the language being used is untheorised identification of past self-representation by status group, "the middling classes" etc. Here "middle class" would mean, rather than those people who owned capital and subsisted off extracting surplus value, it would mean people displaying the culture of the urban burgher and the rural farmer: people who incidentally owned capital, but who could be identified by their tight closed sitting rooms, control over parliamentary politics, inheritance strategies. More Bourdieu or Weber than Marx. 

The theory of history, that history is a linear progress to perfection (generally) or bourgeois liberal society as exemplified in the United Kingdom (specifically) is easily disprovable. For example, the relationships between people in what is now Western Europe sank from legal reciprocity to armed violence as Rome slowly morphed into the Germanic kingdoms. For example, out of a state with codified laws, Mussolini's fascism emerged with its systematic paralegality. On top of this critique, that whig history isn't tenable as it is demonstrably wrong, whig history contains the theoretically suspect category of "progress," which is necessarily ideological in form. To claim as transhistorical (ie: as the universal justification of all historical processes) a particular ideological outcome is not just teleological, it is also anachronistic: whiggery didn't exist during 500BCE. Finally, some use "whig history" to point to any teleological historiography, such as Marx's teleos for example. Teleos in Marx isn't determinate. In the determinate transition to feudalism, there was no further determination of capitalism or socialism. The bourgeoisie were a side effect produced and reproduced by feudalism. Unlike whiggery which postulates a universal and determined project; Marx's description of history's past determination is merely that, a description. Teleology is often used as a criticism, but it doesn't have the force of suggesting someone's history is a whig history. There are circles in which teleological histories are still acceptable, as long as the teleology is demonstrated of course. There aren't circles where I've seen whig history accepted, but this does remind me to suggest to friend that a non-historical discipline they're involved in is playing in the filth of whig history. 

I wish to supplement choster's answer. Communist Party of Australia (CPA) CPA leadership discovered the Secret Speech as the CPNZ leadership transhipped through Australia early in the year. According to the then informal organisation of International fraternal parties, the CPA was dependent on the CPGB for material at this level. They didn't find out until CPNZ leadership had a face to face with CPA leadership. The CPA leadership were horrified by the Secret Speech ontop of 20th Congress. The CPA leadership was highly Stalinised, and had to keep a lid on both Thompson-style reformers, and a left-revolutionary union-based CP vibe. They decided to hide the speech, and the 20th Congress was not heavily discussed in public. When the speech leaked in June through the NYT (IIRC) they policed members vigorously at the Branch level, meaning a leadership directive was issued. This caused a pre-split situation, when a significant body of what would later be called "socialist humanists" and the like started reacting to their persecution within the Party. The CPA had lost most of its left nationalist fellow-travellers from inside the party over 1945 (Revolution Now), 1949 (Too much Revolution) and various other things. The stayers were there because they had strategic or family reasons to be in party. Then Hungary 1956 blew the lid on the Australian party's fragment. Helen Palmer founded Outlook, a socialist humanist journal who spent much of its time reconsidering Leninism through Stalinism and through Indigenous liberation issues. The 1956 splitters were heavily reviled, and as late as 2006 were viciously attacked in public by CPA and ex-CPA members. (Somehow this was a "worse" betrayal than leaving the party over 1945 or 1949 or 1968). The party's engagement with Maoism, and with 1968 issues probably relates to the unresolved questions over reformism and the path to socialism that 1956 brought forward. However, I'd suggest that the Secret Speech brought forward the issue of party independence and democracy, and Hungary brought forward the issues of Stalinism. The Party leadership started looking towards Maoism after this, charting what would eventually become a kind of independent left-reformist-Stalinism conditioned more by the reformist practice of the CPA and its relative union strength as the best militant union leadership body in heavy industry and transport. 

My understanding is that both schools are "broad" interpretive frameworks. The obvious deficiencies of "intentionalism" are clear—we can clearly demonstrate the plurality of emergent genocidal conducts, and these cross German and NSDAP racial categories. The POW origins of systematic camp based killing should be sufficient indication. Goldhagen posits three majors mechanisms for killing: the pogrom, the camp and the death march. In Goldhagen's account, the late war system of death focuses on the use of the death march to eliminate already fatigued prisoners. I suppose that Goldhagen is arguing that the imaginary Jew still required punishment and discipline by the German people. This system of marching people to death is the focus of his attention in the majority of the end of the book. The camps operated until they were in the domain of operational warfare, and then instead of just abandoning prisoners, the camp authorities marched them out to die. Obviously the aims of the policy of massacring, imprisoning, executing and neglecting prisoners were widely shared institutionally and popularly. While Goldhagen is functionalist, his functionalism relates to a cultural history assertion that's pretty unique to Goldhagen about the nature of the German People. (I agree Goldhagen is deeply unsatisfying). If we accept Goldhagen's broad schema of methods of execution, but start looking more broadly, we can see that pogroms continued into 1944/1945 in Yugoslavia and other areas of partisan activity. Similarly the idea of the "camp" as an idee fixe of the "Particularly Jewish Holocaust" breaks down when we consider the death rates of Slavic slave labourers in the late war. I would suggest a few things: 1) That the motivations that drew the majority of the German People and the institutions of German society into systematic murder and death by maltreatment of central and eastern Europeans continued into the late war. 2) That killing Jews and Slavs were broadly shared policy aims throughout German society, and that this policy was still viewed as good and essential into the late war. 3) That the imaginary Jew in the culture of Germany in the 1940s required a particular "punishment" as distinct from the imaginary Slav (see pointless makework). That the imaginary Jew's elimination was a high priority policy across bureaucratic apparatus, and in popular German life (soldier's voluntary "Jew hunts" in rear areas, as opposed to actual anti-partisan operations). So the continuation of the policy for a contemporary functionalist is bound up with the policy continuing to fulfil popular and institutional German policies. It doesn't require Goldhagen's thesis on the German people being fundamentally bad. Finally, I'd suggest that genocide studies in general has retreated from "broadscale" analysis in the past 15 years, and has begun to focus more and more on the individual massacre as the unit of analysis. This seems to be indicating a general breakdown of theoretical categories and an attempt to reconstitute the field from the bottom up. I hope this helps. 

Thanks for the question. "Civic responsibility" is bound up with the concept of the separation of society (the mass of persons) from the state (the armed body of men, monopolised by the bourgeoisie). (Gramsci). The separation of individual subjectivities from the state apparatus, as if they should be connected, arises in the French revolution with the development of the state as an institution justified by the "mass participation" of newly created subjects with rights. Prior to the French revolution, the body of the nation existed merely as the passive object of the attention of the absolute monarch. After the revolution the subjectivity, the capacity for individual action by the monarch became possessed by the entire body of society, and the state became the passive object of the body of subjectivities of the nation. In other words: before civic responsibility—the state acted on pre-society through bureaucracy, after civic responsibility the society enacts the state as a parliament representing society's interest. (Similar processes are visible in the slow British revolution towards general parliamentary representation, the Dutch revolution towards mass social participation, and the US revolution—all early bourgeois revolutions show a measure of this change.) Attempts to describe early relationships as "civic responsibility" will be anachronistic, our version of civic responsibility is thoroughly mired in modernity, the nation state, and the problem of the state adequately representing the general interest. There was no nation for the Quaestor, no "common man," of modernity as a subjectivity in a power relationship. The earliest this can be pushed is into the period of the individuation of moral conscience in Europe—ie, protestant and anti-protestant reforms. And the Dutch revolution remarkably begins in this period, and the English begins at the height of controversy over personal moral responsibility. Sources for theory: 

The answer lies in history being a discursive and inductive practice where our evidentiary materials are untrustworthy. A preponderance of the evidence, correctly interpreted, with a correct interpretation of what constitutes relevant evidence is required. This is obviously debatable. My invaluable peasant letters are your irrelevant ephemera. Proofs can't be offered inductively; only unrefuted conjectures. 

What is China has changed over time, as have the number of people in China, as has China's level of per capita output (GDP prior to capitalism is an anachronistic imposition if measured in a current value expression), as has the number of people not-in-China, as have the level of per capita output in places not-China. The assumption that China's proportion of world output would remain static is a less tenable hypothesis than that all proportions of long lasting cultural nexuses of output would vary. 

In specific relation to Marx's teleology (at various stages), let's consider 1847's Poverty of Philosophy at chapter 2: 

This question is historically unanswerable. The wikipedia article is exhaustively sourced for this kind of article, and it didn't uncover the legal intention of the Baron who connived this law. As wikipedia says, "Samuel Midgley in his Halifax and its Gibbet-Law Placed in a True Light,[c] published in 1761, states that the law dates from a time "not in the memory of man to the contrary".[6] It may have been the consequence of rights granted by King Henry III to John de Warenne (1231–1304), Lord of the Manor of Wakefield.[7]" The phrase, "not in the memory of man to the contrary" indicates that it was an ancient custom or practice. These ancient customs and practices were almost always inventions by one member of the peasant/lord power relation, usually as a way to circumvent other existing laws. As the Gibbet-Law was baronial law, it was probably an invention of John de Warenne or his ancestors. The actual practice in Halifax indicates that it was practiced in the class interest of the baron, "So strictly was the law applied that anyone who apprehended a thief with his property was not allowed to recover it unless the miscreant and the stolen goods were presented to the bailiff. The goods were otherwise forfeited to the lord of the manor, and their previous rightful owner was liable to find himself charged with theftbote, or conniving in the felony.[7]" We cannot know the prices of goods with any certainty from this era, nor the intentions of the law makers. Wikipedia disagrees with my speculation above, following a speculation from Holt, "Eighteenth-century historians argued that the area's prosperity attracted the "wicked and ungovernable"; the cloth, left outside and unattended, presented easy pickings, and hence justified severe punishment to protect the local economy. James Holt on the other hand, writing in 1997, sees the Halifax Gibbet Law as a practical application of the Anglo-Saxon law of infangtheof. Royal assizes were held only twice a year in the area; to bring a prosecution was "vastly expensive", and the stolen goods were forfeited to the Crown, as they were considered to be the property of the accused.[22]" Holt, James Clarke (1997), Colonial England, 1066–1215, Hambledon Continuum, ISBN 978-1-85285-140-8 p23 and the following speculation, "But the Halifax Gibbet Law allowed "the party injured, to have his goods restored to him again, with as little loss and damage, as can be contrived; to the great encouragement of the honest and industrious, and as great terror to the wicked and evil doers."[23]" Midgley, Samuel; Bentley, William (1761), Halifax and its Gibbet-Law Placed in a True Light, J. Milner p404. I would describe these speculations as "whiggish" in that they ascribe to law an intention that was unlikely to have arisen, and give the law the character of an impartial disinterested power serving the community. We have strong and good reasons to believe that Baronial law never functioned with these intentions or character. Wikipedia cannot supply an intention or price of cloth at the formation of the law. We do not have good wage-price series to 1304, and it is my real belief that wage price series before 1750 shouldn't be used. However, we do have a good to price equivalent from the last execution: 9s per yard of cloth. (Wikipedia). If pushed, I would argue that 1s 1d and 1/2d is an intellectually pleasing amount indicating that it is one step more than a shilling and a pence: it is a compounded amount. I'd also dispute wikipedia's inflation of 1650~2008 £5.40, using purchasing power parity, and instead suggest something along the lines of 1270~2011 ~£13,400 using share GDP as a better expression of the economic weight of 13 and a half yards of cloth. For the utility of the questioner: Wikipedia reports 9 yards (11.25 English ell) and 15 yards (18.75 English ell) stolen in the 17th century. 10 ell is 12.5 yards, 11 ell is 13.75 yards. In 1779 the cloth trade traded 30 yard pieces ( $URL$ ). So if pieces were an ancient practice, the numbers have no relation to piece length. 

The Nove / Millar debate was a debate amongst economic historians in the 1970s, where the Western understanding of Soviet economic development in the 1920 and 1930s was seriously revised. In particular the debate engaged the relationship between the agricultural and the industrial sectors of the economy, and the potential ways the party could have structured these relationships to achieve industrialisation. With greater detail: 

Gorski 2000 seems to indicate part of the problem is the fetishisation of organised religion as an indicator of peasant religiosity and the corresponding privileging of Christian narratives of appropriate religious behaviour in medieval Europe.(Van Engen 1986 in Gorski 2000) The peasantry depicted in all these historiographies was fundamentally religious—what it was not what organised or Christian in comparison to the opinion of the Church. So the answer is "yes, they were fundamentally religious, but your question is wrong as it incorporates unacceptable normative assumptions." Medieval popular cultures were local, Christian, Magical, Pagan, Churched and non-Churched. But fundamentally religious in the sense that a metaphysical determination of reality was constant, and the observation or propitiation of a reality other than the apparent was required. Gorski supplies a full literature review with critical analysis as of 2000. Any question you may have on the topic will be fully covered in Gorski. 

The term PTSD was invented in the 1980s by the medical discipline of psychiatry. The condition which the term PTSD refers to was well known to people from antiquity under various names with different meanings specific to those societies ( $URL$ ). The matter is being discussed more now in particular, because the medical condition grants certain benefits and stigmas which previous accounts of the trauma of war didn't grant or stigmatise. We live in a society where discussion is common and discussion is used as a way to resolve or draw out conflicts; using people with what we call PTSD as pawns in social contests. Previous discussions of the underlying trauma were discussed in the manners natural to those particular societies. Whether those people actually suffered PTSD is debateable: the definition didn't exist until recently, and aspects of the definition would be incomprehensible to earlier people. They used their own terms to socially and culturally explain what war trauma meant to them. 

Around 1671CE two turbine steam engined devices were presented by the Jesuit Friar Min-Ming Wo to for the Khang-Hsi emperor. Joseph Needham and Wang Ling. Mechanical Engineering. In Science and Civilisation in China Vol 4 (Physics and Physical Technology) Book 2. CUP 1965: p225ff. 

Necessity then is the combination of supply (embodying value), and intensification of production as capitalisation (requiring greater realisation to realise the cost of capital, such as slaves), with a willingness to raise the volume and variety of utilities consumed in the metropole while avoiding raising the value composition of the consumed bundle. A similar process occurs later with cotton, or iron work, or iphones.
