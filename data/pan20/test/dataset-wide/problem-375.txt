It is possible, indeed it is already done today, it is called a Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. But, I can't find any problem related to the continuous blood flow nor its benefits. 

For now just don't care about the B227, it can't harm you after all, the main problem is if the Agonizer leaves the planet, the B227 will have plenty of time to reinvade Berusslow-4c. So don't leave the planet. Make the Agonizer refuel in the biggest "gas station" of the planet, make reserves, and burn it down if there are still energy in it. Then go into low orbit to ensure that one orbit completion is too short for the B227 to refuel at another refuel station (if there is more than one). Thus, the B227 will also stay in low orbit to avoid being shot. Make some energy consuming maneuvers (atmosphere entry, pro-grade burning, retrograde burning, ...). By doing so, the B227 will hopefully run out of energy sooner than the Agonizer. Which will let it few choices: 

In this school, future wizards will acquire a tremendous knowledge and power. This amnesia is forced to ensure that future wizard will not use this new power to get revenge or satisfy needs they got in their past life. 

It seems for someone to fit your requirements, they can't instigate what they are famous for. Even if they don't instigate it, you may disqualify them for having an aforementioned trait whether or not that trait (indirectly) caused the thing or was utilized in their response to it. 

Most people have referenced personal taste or societal trends or fashion, and indeed this is a sufficient reason. I'll focus on two other reasons: Status A futuristic world could have a growing population living on a relatively fixed amount of land. In such a case, land is a commodity, and having a large amount of personal property would be a visual indicator of wealth. Now it defeats the purpose if the house doesn't match, so why not make it extra large? Add a handful of guest rooms, a ballroom, an oversized library and/or study, and you've got yourself a manor or a mansion. 

Notes: a) Depending on how aristocratic your future society is, it might make sense for tight-knit (or not-so-much) families to come together in a single home. b) The wealthy might opt to build their home on a less crowded planet, or build a high-class community on an artificial (and mobile?) island. 

I think signal convolution between the sound and a prerecorded shot sound should suffice to determinate that is actually a shot (a trained human can easily separate shot from other sounds), and we admit that this computation is instantaneous. Thus, only the sound travel time must be taken into consideration. The speed of sound at sea level and in ISA conditions (25°C, 1013.25 hPa, ...) is 340.29 m / s, thus the time to reach the cyborg "ear" is $$t = \frac{distance}{speed} = \frac{20}{340.29} = 0.058 s = 58ms$$ The main problem is that sentence is actually false. This is the problem when something has passed the sound barrier, the sound is behind the object. Thus, if your cyborg is shot, the bullet would reach them before any sound does. (In fact the shockwave created just on the tip of the bullet is ahead of the bullet and if you want to hear it you have to listen to the bullet tip... and you don't want to put your ear there). 

In order to build this scale, I need some criteria that help evolution or curb it. What are the planet criteria that influence evolution of life ? I know that distance from star, the type of star, presence and composition of the atmosphere, temperature are capital for example. Are there any others ? In what extent are they important ? 

Hard science: No. That said, the best theory I can give you is that humanity has always had the potential ability to manipulate reality—something intrinsic to our intelligence probably. To activate the ability requires the right mindset, and maybe the right genes. The right mood or mindset creates the right brain chemistry to allow the ability to turn on, but then it also takes the right effort or skill to actually apply the ability. You can cite all the scriptural miracles as evidence. If your character isn't a prophet sort of person, then maybe his genes are a new mutation that allow for a wider range in brain chemistry to turn on the ability than the rest of humanity. 

I'd like to note that your problem might be stemming more from your approach. It sounds like you might be describing the material world more than you are describing the culture. As a reference, Treasure Planet comes to mind. It's a futuristic world, but has a heavy colonial and piratic feel. 

Frankly, I think notable on any significant scale entails historical impact. Here's some examples along ozone's famous victim path. 

Completely non historical answer : It seems that the most convenient way to transport a spear is on the back/on your shoulder. With a string tied to the upper and the lower part of the spear, you just pass your shoulder between the string and the spear and you are good to go. You just have to lean a bit to go through doors. For walking in the forest I think holding the spear with at least one hand is better to avoid to stuck it in a tree. Or you can make a convenient cover, with two straps to use it like a backpack. But it is really less convenient if you have to use it quickly to defend yourself... But depending on the technology used you may make it telescopic, it would be much more convenient to transport. If the weapon is the main one of your character it could be unique and customized, and a telescopic spear could be really cool. 

The magical power is hidden deep into the Earth; powerful magicians are just simple people with the ability to attract this power from the Earth into their body. This power (like many things) is attracted by a force similar to gravity (this is why it is inside the Earth and the planets more generally). Thus, when celestial bodies are in conjunction, their gravity-like forces are adding each other, consequently the magical power is attracted to the surface or even worse... directly into well-placed wizards... Just like the Moon and the Sun attract water to form tides. For example you can state that magic attracts magic and replace the mass by a kind of magical potential in the gravitational equation. I think the Moon would be full of magic, so would the Sun. 

Organic The quantum-powered hero gets headaches when perilous situations are coming up because he died in some other possibility and it collapses back through time to a point of low peril. Some possibilities collapse clearly; others don't. Naturally, boss fights are especially dangerous futures, so it's natural for collapses to happen right before such fights—it's a relatively—and for you to subsequently collapse back to this point. Unknown The small shrines to the ancient god of death aren't recognizable by most these days, and it might be the god has a shrine guardian preventing people from noticing. Regardless, you're in his employ, so you can pray at these shrines and the god of death will remember your prayer. Then you go assassinate someone as part of your beliefs. If you fail, well, the god of death isn't done with you; he'll reject your death and return you to the last shrine you prayed at. Perhaps a shrine is constructed there for your convenience since the god of death gave you this dangerous assignment and suspected you'd need it. It could also, be a natural feature the enemy camp incorporated into their layout. Maybe it serves as a common household decoration, and the unwitting decorators for your next target have helped you out. Immovable Due to the nature of the Ancient's engineering, there's no practical way to move the their restoration chambers. If only someone had the right genes to make use of them... If no one is known to be able to exploit these inconvenient chambers, then enemies will just build around them. If this spot is the best for the enemy boss, then the "unusable" restoration chamber outside the door doesn't make a difference—it's alien tech that they had to work around. Note: This one doesn't work in the long-run. Anybody finding out that an enemy can just respawn indefinitely in their base will relocate somewhere safer. Secret Some of your robotic compatriots have discretely embedded some reconstruction points in the enemy base. It's doubtful the humans will figure out about the reconstruction points: all robots look the same, so how could they know it's the same robot attacking again and again. Even if they were looking, it'd be hard to find them without a special robotic vision mode/mod. Your compatriots would naturally plant these points in optimal spots for you, and right before the Big Bad Boss is, I would think, very optimal. Note: This one doesn't work well in the long-run unless the antagonists are really dumb and don't pick up on the pattern, but it would probably work longer than the immovable solution. 

The acceleration equation is : with Here you want and So . Which results in w (omega) = 0.4041 rad.s^-1 = 3.86 tr/min 

This question does not take into account the Sun effect on the tides, which is in fact greater than the one made by the moon. So this answer explains why removing tides does NOT curb the oceans rising problem I don't think so, because, you are right, when the moon is "above" the ocean, the water is rising. But this additional quantity of water does not come from nowhere, so when the sea level is rising somewhere, it is going down somewhere else. The thing with the ice melting is that you add water to the overall quantity by releasing the water contained in the ice on the land. So by destroying the moon (and the tide effect of the Sun, too) you would just make an average sea level which would be rising over time. 

I think the term Artificial Intelligence is widely used... and misused. The problem is even though everybody can agree (at least it is less discussed) on what is "Artificial" : not natural, human-made, which requires skills to make; a lot of people are struggling at defining the "Intelligence". Anyway, the definition I think people should know is the one defined in 2003 by Russel and Norvig. To sum up, they state that an intelligence must "think" or "act" and it can do it in 2 ways "like a human" or "rationally". Thus, it gives you 4 cases in which your question has different answers.
