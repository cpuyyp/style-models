Just to follow up on Eric's correct answer: when you have an almost complex structure $J$, you can decompose $1$-forms into type $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Locally, you can find a local basis $e^1, \ldots, e^n$ of $(1,0)$-forms, but these are not of the form $dz^1, \ldots, dz^n$. Indeed, as Eric mentioned, we do not have local holomorphic coordinates. Then $\bar e^1, \ldots, \bar e^n$ are a local basis of $(0,1)$ forms. Now if we compute $de^i$, it is a $2$-form, so it can be written in the form \begin{equation*} de^i = a^i_{jk} e^j \wedge e^k + b^i_{jk} e^j \wedge \bar e^k + c^i_{jk} \bar e^j \wedge \bar e^k. \end{equation*} The almost complex structure $J$ is integrable if and only if all the $c^i_{jk}$'s are zero. 

I decided to make my comment into a more detailed answer. When $M$ has an almost complex structure $J$, then one can talk about smooth complex-valued differential forms of type $(p,q)$ in the usual way. A complex valued $2$-form $\omega$ is type $(1,1)$ if and only if it satisfies $\omega(JX,JY) = \omega(X,Y)$ for all smooth vector fields $X$ and $Y$ on $M$. If $\omega$ is a real $2$-form of type $(1,1)$, which means that $\overline \omega = \omega$, and if we define $g(X,Y) = \omega(X, JY)$, then it is easy to show that $g$ is a smooth, symmetric bilinear form on $M$. So it is a Riemannian metric if and only if it is positive definite. This is the definition of a positive $(1,1)$-form (that the associated $g$ is positive definite.) The triple of data $(J, \omega, g)$, where $J$ is an almost complex structure, $\omega$ is a real positive $(1,1)$-form, and $g$ is the associated Riemannian metric as defined above together define an almost Hermitian manifold. Now the condition for $M$ to be Kaehler is that $M$ be complex ($J$ is integrable) and that $d\omega = 0$. (These two conditions can be packaged together as $\nabla \omega = 0$ or $\nabla J = 0$, where $\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection of $g$.) Hence, if one is starting out with a complex manifold $M$, together with a closed real $2$-form, the only additional condition required to ensure that it defines a Kaehler metric is that it be a positive $(1,1)$-form. 

The central limit property of $h$ follows from the main result of: David Freedman and David Lane, "The Empirical Distribution of Fourier Coefficients", Ann. Statist. Volume 8, Number 6 (1980), 1244-1251. They show that all the Fourier coefficients (not trivially related as complex conjugates) are asymptotically independent. 

A somewhat lengthy calculation, involving integrals, reveals that the probability an $n\times n$ Hermitian matrix, drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble, is positive definite, decays as $\left(\sqrt{3}\right)^{-n^2}$ for large $n$. I can’t say what decay constant I had expected, given the context, but it certainly wasn’t $\sqrt{3}$ ! Is there a deeper or more direct explanation for the appearance of this number? 

Consider the random variable $S=(s_0, \dots ,s_{N-1})$, a sequence of signs uniformly distributed on the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^N$. With the Fourier transform we can define $N$ random walk variables $$ \hat{s}_q=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \zeta^{q k} s_k, \qquad q=0, \ldots, N-1, $$ where $\zeta=e^{2\pi i/N}$ and to keep things simple we take $N$ to be prime. As we take $N\to\infty$ all of these have normal distributions: $\hat{s}_0$ on the real line and the others in the complex plane. I would like to be able to claim that these random variables become independent as $N\to\infty$ in a certain qualified sense. First, since $\hat{s}_q$ and $\hat{s}_{-q}$ are complex conjugates we only consider $q\in\{1,\ldots,(N-1)/2\}$. Second, I am only interested in "fixed-information" counterparts of these. We define these random variables as $f(\hat{s}_q)$, where $f$ maps the complex plane to a finite set. For example (in fact the case that generated this question), $f$ might be take the magnitude of the complex number and round it to 7 significant digits, or to $\infty$ if the magnitude exceeds a certain bound (in order to keep the cardinality of the range of $f$ fixed as $N\to\infty$). Is it true, say for particular kinds of fixed-information maps, that $f(\hat{s}_q)$ and $f(\hat{s}_{q'})$, $q\ne q'$, are independent as $N\to\infty$? 

Well, now there is a great textbook for Sasaki-Einstein geometry, by Boyer-Galicki: Here is a link to the book at Oxford University Press I would definitely start there. 

Kevin Lin gave a great technical answer to this question (which should be accepted) but I would like to add some more "philosophical" reasons for this: [1] algebraic geometry methods are easier to apply and much more well-developed. I don't mean algebraic geometry is easy, I just mean that the tools, by their nature, give more concrete results (for example, on toric varieties), as opposed to geometric analysis methods, which by their nature often yield non-constructive or non-explicit results. [2] the algebraic geometers got into the Mirror Symmetry game much earlier and made more rapid progress than the differential geometers. (And they wrote many of the books.) I would still appreciate more answers, though. Perhaps people who are very adept at having a dual existence (like Eric Zaslow) can contribute their opinions? 

I would also add the following book: Dominic Joyce, Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy The early parts of the book include an introduction to the Riemannian geometry of Calabi-Yau manifolds. It also includes a proof of the Calabi conjecture. 

[First paragraph has been edited, after Vitali's comments below.] According to one convention, hyperKahler manifolds are not actually quaternionic-Kahler. This is the case if you define hyperKahler as having holonomy exactly $\mathrm{Sp}(m)$, and quaternionic-Kahler as having holonomy exactly $\mathrm{Sp}(n) \cdot \mathrm{Sp}{1} = (\mathrm{Sp}(n) \times \mathrm{Sp}(1)) / \lbrace \pm 1 \rbrace$, where in both cases the real dimension is $4m$. In fact, these "strictly" quaternionic-Kahler manifolds are NOT even Kahler, so they are poorly named, but unfortunately, the name has stuck. HyperKahler manifolds are always Ricci-flat, but quaternionic-Kahler manifolds are always Einstein with nonzero Einstein constant. By contrast, hypercomplex manifolds need not have a Riemannian metric at all. Being hypercomplex means that one has a triple $I, J, K$ of almost complex structures which satisfy the quaternion multiplication relations. I can't remember if one requires them to all be integrable or if this is always true. On a hyperKahler manifold, we certainly have such a structure, so it is hypercomplex. A quaternionic-Kahler manifold does not admit such complex structures globally, only locally, but the $4$-form $\Omega = \omega_I^2 + \omega_J^2 + \omega_K^2$ is actually globally defined, where $\omega_I = g(I \cdot, \cdot)$ is the associated Kahler form to $I$. Added later: Quaternionic projective space $\mathbb H \mathbb P^n$ is not hyperKahler. For example, $\mathbb H \mathbb P^1 \cong S^4$, which cannot even be Kahler, since $b_2(S^4) = 0$. 

Consider the random variable $S=(s_0, \dots ,s_{N-1})$, a sequence of signs uniformly distributed on the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^N$. We are interested in $N$ large and prime. The Fourier transform $\hat{S}=(\hat{s}_0, \dots ,\hat{s}_{N-1})$, where $$ \hat{s}_q=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \zeta^{q k} s_k, \qquad \zeta=e^{2\pi i/N}, $$ defines a new multivariate random variable. Finally, consider the univariate random variable $$ h=\left(\prod_{q=1}^{N-1}\hat{s}_q\right)^\frac{1}{N-1}=\left(\prod_{q=1}^{(N-1)/2}|\hat{s}_q|^2\right)^\frac{1}{N-1}. $$ This variable is the scaled algebraic norm of the cyclotomic integer whose coefficients are $S$. I would like to prove that $h$ has the central limit property for $N\to \infty$, that is, its distribution becomes increasingly concentrated at one value. The plausibility argument goes like this. Consider a "baby" estimator of the variable given by the geometric mean of a fixed number $M$ of the $|\hat{s}_q|^2$, instead of all $(N-1)/2$. For this fixed number of Fourier transform components we have a multivariate central limit theorem, for $N\to \infty$. When we apply CLT and compute the covariance matrix, we find that these $|\hat{s}_q|^2$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. The baby estimators therefore have the central limit property for $M\to\infty$. Unfortunately, the $M\to\infty$ limit of the baby estimators may be a different random variable than the $N\to \infty$ limit of $h$. 

With help, offline, from P. Diaconis: I believe my "fixed information" map is really just a license to take the limit $N\to \infty$ before asking if the random variables are independent. Now, if I exercise this license, I notice that $\hat{s}_q$ and $\hat{s}_{q'}$ have a bivariate normal distribution (in the limit), and when I work out the covariance matrix, which I can do for finite $N$, I see that indeed the two variables are independent for $q\ne q'$ (taking the $N\to \infty$ limit of the covariance matrix). 

Let $V$ be an $n$-dimensional real vector space with an inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$. Then $\Lambda^k (V)$, the $k^{\text{th}}$ exterior product of $V$, inherits an induced inner product defined as follows. If $\alpha = v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k$ and $\beta = w_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge w_k$, then $\langle \alpha , \beta \rangle = \det \langle v_i , w_j \rangle$ on decomposable vectors, and then extend by linearity to all of $\Lambda^k(V)$. Now a $k$-dimensional subspace $P$ of $V$ can be represented by a decomposable element $\alpha_P = v_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_k$ of $\Lambda^k(V)$, where $v_1, \ldots, v_k$ is a basis for $P$. If the basis is taken to be oriented and orthonormal, then the element $\alpha_P$ is uniquely determined. (Otherwise it is only determined up to a non-zero real scalar, so in general it defines a point in the projectivization $\mathbb P (\Lambda^k(V))$. Since this is a real inner product on a finite-dimensional vector space, it does indeed give you a measure of "how far" two vectors are from being parallel, or in this case, how far two $k$-dimensional subspaces are from being the same. If $k = 2$ and $a_1, a_2$ and $b_1, b_2$ are two oriented orthonormal bases for two planes $P_a$ and $P_b$ in $V$, then $$ \langle P_a, P_b \rangle = \det{\langle a_i, b_j \rangle} = \langle a_1, b_1 \rangle \langle a_2, b_2 \rangle - \langle a_1, b_2 \rangle \langle a_2, b_1 \rangle. $$ You can search for "induced inner product on exterior algebra" or look at any book on differential forms for more details. 

I can't say I share Littlewood's sense of humor, but here is a formula that made me grin the first time I saw it ($A$ and $B$ are non-commuting square matrices): \begin{equation}\frac{d}{dt}e^{A+B t}=\int_0^1 e^{s(A+B t)}\ B\ e^{(1-s)(A+B t)} \ ds. \end{equation} 

Hadamard matrices may be characterized as $n\times n$ real orthogonal matrices $U$ that achieve the lowest possible "energy" as defined by the (scaled and shifted) entry-wise 1-norm: $$ E(U)=n^2 -\sqrt{n}\,\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n |U_{i j}|. $$ We'll consider only those $n$ for which Hadamard matrices exist; their energy is zero. I'm interested in the minimum energy "barrier" between distinct Hadamard matrices. Let $U_0$ and $U_1$ be distinct Hadamard matrices and $U_t$ a continuous map from the unit interval to orthogonal matrices (a "curve") with these matrices as endpoints. The energy barrier, for this curve, is the maximum over $t$ of the energy: $$ \Delta E(U_t)=\max_t E(U_t). $$ Finally, define $\Delta E$ as the infimum of energy barriers over all curves that join any pair of distinct Hadamard matrices. $\Delta E$ is easily bounded above by $90^\circ$ Givens rotations (as curves) that have the effect of swapping two rows or columns of a Hadamard matrix; the maximum energy, at the halfway point, is $(2-\sqrt{2})n$. Is this bound sharp, or are there smaller barriers? 

I like Cliff Taubes's simple titles: "Gr -> SW", "SW -> Gr", and "SW = Gr". (Okay, they each also have a subtitle, but the first part is enough to tell the reader exactly what the paper is about.) 

Of course, it depends on the Riemannian metric you put on $\mathbb O \mathbb P^1 \cong S^8$. For the round metric you do indeed get $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ holonomy. A priori, one could imagine other "natural" metrics with reduced holonomy. However, we know by the Berger classification that if the metric was not locally symmetric, since the dimension is $8$, the only possibilities for the holonomy would imply the existence of a non-trivial parallel $2$-form or $4$-form, which is impossible in this case because of the topology of $S^8$. I suppose that one could find some way to write $S^8 = G/H$ as a Riemannian homogenous space, in which case the holonomy would be $H$, but I am not the right person to ask about this. The only way I know how to do this is to take $G = \mathrm{SO}(9)$ and $H = \mathrm{SO}(8)$, which gives us back the round $S^8$ again. 

Let's suppose that $M$ is a connected $1$-dimensional smooth manifold (Haussdorf and paracompact). We know that there are exactly two types, up to diffeomorphism (even up to homeomorphism), namely $\mathbb R$ and $S^1$. These are clearly both orientable, and one "high-powered" way to show this it is to show that the top exterior power $\Lambda^n (T^*M)$ of its cotangent bundle, which is the cotangent bundle itself since $n=1$, is trivial, because each of these manifolds is a Lie group. Of course, if you already know that the only ones are $\mathbb R^1$ and $S^1$, you can also directly show from the "oriented cover" definition of orientability that they are indeed both orientable. I am teaching a third-year curves and surfaces course, and what I am looking for is the following. Suppose you don't know what all the connected $1$-dimensional smooth manifolds are. (In my course we can suppose they are embedded submanifolds of $\mathbb R^n$, but that's not very important.) How can one show, using elementary ideas, that any connected curve has to be orientable? I believe that one way to do this is the following: show that any connected curve can be expressed as the image of a single regular parametrized curve. Once we have this, we're done. It is clear that the argument should use the fact that we can always "reparametrize by arc-length", and by measuring the arc-length from a fixed point in a fixed initial direction, one either gets a diffeomorphism with $\mathbb R$ or with $S^1$, depending on whether or not the curve is closed. Is there an easy way to justify this to students in a curves and surfaces class? Is there an easier argument that I haven't noticed? The reason I am thinking about this is because all the undergraduate curves and surfaces texts spend a lot of time explaining why surfaces need not be orientable, but never discuss why orientability is never an issue for curves. They also spend a lot of time talking about "covering a surface with multiple coordinate charts" but never discuss (except for $S^1$, sometimes) the need to cover a curve by more than one chart. It would be nice to be able to give my students an easy (but rigorous) explanation of the orientability of any connected curve. 

I'm interested in a family of properties of connected simple graphs that comes up in percolation theory. Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. Now consider the set of subgraphs of $G$ that I will call "cores". A core $C$ of $G$ is a connected subgraph of $G$ with the property that upon "removing" $C$ from $G$ the resulting graph has no edges. I define "removing" as deleting from $G$ all vertices and edges in $C$. Note that a core is not the same as the induced subgraph of a connected dominating set (which makes reference only to the vertices of $C$ and not its edges). For example, the triangle graph has 1 core which is the triangle graph itself, 3 cores that are chains of 3 vertices, and 3 cores that are chains of 2 vertices. The properties are defined by sums over all the cores: $f_k(G)=(-1)^{v(G)+1}\sum_{\mathrm{cores}\, C\in G} v(C)^k (-1)^{e(C)}$. Here $v(C)$ and $e(C)$ are respectively the number of vertices and edges in $C$, and $k$ is a non-negative integer. I've proved that $f_1(G)=0$ for every connected $G$ except for the 1-vertex graph, for which $f_1=1$. I therefore do not need a name for property $f_1$. What about $f_2$? Here are some special cases. When $G$ is a tree with $n>1$ vertices, then $f_2(G)=0$ unless it is a path; for that case $f_2(G)=2$. Now consider cycles of length $n$. For these the $f_2$ values are $n(n-1)$ . For the complete graphs $f_2(K_n)=n!$ . Perhaps these special cases will help someone make the connection with a known property. Addendum: I welcome suggestions for a better term for what I've called a graph "core". Here is a rewording of the definition, in case there is still confusion. A core $C$ of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ induced by a subset of the edges of $G$ and which has the following two properties: (1) $C$ is connected, and (2) every edge of $G$ is incident on a vertex of $C$. It's not obvious from the definition of $f_k(G)$ that these integers are always nonnegative, but I believe this is true for all positive $k$. Is $f_k(G)$ counting something in $G$? If so, then the definition in terms of cores (and the naming problem) can be avoided. 

This is probably closer in spirit to what you're looking for than what you've received in the comments. If $(V^{2m}, J, \omega, g)$ is Calabi-Yau (which for me means that $J$ is integrable, and the first Chern class $c_1(V) = 0$), then one can say much more. In this case there exists a holomorphic nowhere vanishing $(m,0)$ form $\Omega$, called the "holomorphic volume form." The form $\Omega$ is unique up to multiplication by a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function. We don't need to assume that $\Omega$ is parallel, but Yau's theorem does tell us (if $V$ is compact) that we can change the metric, keeping the Kaehler class $[\omega]$ unchanged, to make $\Omega$ parallel (and consequently also the new metric will be Ricci-flat.) But I have digressed. In such a situation, if $L$ is Lagrangian, then it is well known that the restriction of $\Omega$ to $L$ is equal to $e^{i \theta} \mathrm{Vol_L}$, where $\mathrm{Vol}_L$ is the volume form of $L$ (with the induced metric) and $e^{i \theta}$ is the "phase" of the Lagrangian, where $\theta : L \to \mathbb R/ (2 \pi \mathbb Z)$ is a smooth, multivalued function on $L$. In addition, the mean curvature $H$ of $L$ in $V$ is given by $H = J \nabla \theta$. So the minimal Lagrangian submanifolds (vanishing mean curvature) correspond to those with constant phase function $\theta = \theta_0$. In this case, if $L$ is compact, then the volume of $L$ is given by $\mathrm{Vol} (L) = \int_L \mathrm{Vol}_L = \int_L e^{-i \theta_0} \Omega = e^{- i \theta_0} [\Omega] \cdot [L],$ which is topological. (It looks complex, but it's actually real, because $[\Omega]$ is a class in $H^g(V, \mathbb C)$.) If you prefer, you can just replace $\Omega$ by $e^{- i \theta_0} \Omega$ to get rid of the phase factor. Such "minimal Lagrangian" submanifolds, whose volume is purely topological, are also called special Lagrangian submanifolds, and are widely studied in calibrated geometry and differential geometric approaches to mirror symmetry. The best place to start looking is the text "Riemannian Holonomy Groups and Calibrated Geometry" by Dominic Joyce and its multiple references. I'm not sure how much of this will extend to the case of $J$ non-integrable and $c_1(V) \neq 0$. I'd have to think about it.
