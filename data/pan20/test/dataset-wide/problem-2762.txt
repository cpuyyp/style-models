To describe something you’re holding in your hand such as an ‘apparent’ apple as either “real” or “unreal” is a question of genuineness or authenticity. Either way you have a genuine apple or a genuine fake (representation). In this context you have useful information regarding affordances (J.J. Gibson) - a genuine apple is edible a fake one not. To describe “everything” (The universe as a whole) as either “real” or “unreal” seems to me like a categorical error. Statements like “we cannot prove that there is a reality”, smack of folly, since they suggest that there is a ‘standard reality’ by which you can differentiate. If there is no benchmark reality by which to make a comparison, then I’d say the concept has no extension. Also the existence of just about everything (apart from what is normative/conventional or artificial) is not contingent upon whether you have a conception/notion of it or not. Either way the [Real(apple) V –Real(apple)] makes pretty good [Real(cider) V –Real (cider)], which gets me [Real(soused) V –Real (soused)], or better yet {Realy[Real(soused)]} V –{Realy[Real (soused)]}! 

One gets the distinct impression that consensus is anathema to philosophy. Eric Dietrich gives a good account of Philosophy’s antinomic character: $URL$ Also David Chalmers has had a crack at the whip, but I find it a tad pretentious and dishonest. And by that I mean, if you were going to be brutally honest about philosophical consensus, your conclusions would be very much like that of Wittgenstein’s: (4th paper under 2014) $URL$ 

Consider the following: S1: The assumption that “the chair has certain affordances (weathered, rickety, sturdy, available, etc.)” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity (sitting, avoiding sitting, using as an improvised ladder/a shelf, hanging my coat, burning for heat, etc.) that couples an agent x to the (chair). S2: The assumption that “the patient has advanced artery disease” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity (the administration of statin, nitro-glycerine, ACE inhibitors, advice about radical dietary changes, etc.) that couples the surgeon x to the (patient’s heart/cardiovascular system). S3: The assumption that “consciousness has the property P (physicality, non-physicality, non- localness, universally distributed, etc.)” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity that couples an agent x to the (phenomena of consciousness). There’s obviously nothing controversial about S1 and S2. But, the glaring issue about S3 is precisely what ‘activity’ or ‘operation’ are we talking about here? What is it that you couldn’t actually do (and not just talk about doing) if you weren’t working with the assumption that “consciousness has whatever property P”? 

I think this goes back as far as Russell and his theory of definite descriptions (“On Denoting” 1905) which in part tried to deal with non-existent entities and to preserve the law of the excluded middle (vis. statements about non-existent entities seem to be neither true of false). If you have a concept to which nothing existent corresponds then that concepts extension is said to be the null set. So the extension of the concepts ghost and werewolves are equivalent- they are both “non-differentiable” members of the same null set. 

Part of Marx's legacy was the realization that identity need not be passive. The International Workers movement he helped to fomented was perhaps the largest secular transnational identity formations on the planet. One need not be passive (or reactive) in the face of identity. We have the capacity to forge new ones, based on new lines in the sand, the communities we seek to establish. What he was fully aware of that perhaps many of his followers weren't was just the extent to which the politics of identity needed to be a continual struggle or effort if they were to succeed. And not as something separate from politics in general, but as a central feature insofar as it is a type of branding on individuals who can either be supporters or who can take on an opposing identity of the enemy of what you represent. 

1) Antonio Negri is probably the person that has most radically built on Marxist thought in a way that attempts to explore the philosophical implications of the changes the world has seen since the 19th century. Part of what's most radical about his project has been the de-Hegelianization of Marx's thought with him. His is probably the most profound reengagement Marx's work since Althusser. 2) David Harvey is a geographer by profession but is one of the most renown contemporary Marxists that attempts to analyze the world today from a Marxist lense. He isn't a philosopher so his language and work would likely be more "accessible" than that of Negri who is a bit more difficult to digest if you're not familiar with others that have heavily influenced him, like Spinoza. 3) Terry Eagleton & Frederic Jameson might be good to look at as well as they both approach contemporary Marxism from its cultural aspects as opposed to the economics side that Harvey would be more versed in or the philosophical that Negri would be the best source on. Jacques Ranciere might also be considered in this category, but Ranciere is a fairly adept philosopher. 4) Surrounding Negri are other Marxist theorists that are interesting in their own right: Yann Mouliere Boutang is an economist by profession who's specialty these days are understanding the cutting edge of capitalist development from a Marxist standpoint (that is to say, to analyze the political implication of the broad scale evolutions of Capital); and Christian Marazzi is similar to Boutang, but focuses more on the financial/monetary side of exploring contemporary capitalism and the political and philosophical implications of things like wage relations/exploitation etc. 5) Etienne Balibar since the 1960's has been cranking out analyses of Marx's work and attempting to reinterpret his questions and methodology in novel ways. He is not a very flashy philosopher but he is very thorough and thoughtful. He engages with the same types of subjects as a Badiou or Zizek but he's keeps the discussion at much more practical level. 

For Epicurus, the problem with the fear of death is the same as with any other sort of fear for him. It is firstly an obstacle to knowledge. One has to remember that he grounds his Ethics with a Physics. He's interested in things as they are as that helps us live the good life. To obtain knowledge one has to look for adequate causes of phenomena, not fear phenomena. And the knowledge isn't just for mental consolation purposes but to know how to deal with it. If one doesn't know how to swim, we see water and immediately sense fear, because that water presents a danger to us. Adequate knowledge allows us however to understand our relations with water and with practice we can come to work with it, to learn to swim. Fear is contrasted to learning, to curiosity. It's recoiling, as opposed to a careful "working-with". The second problem of fear (in general) is that it is the single greatest cause of man's misery (under the guise of anxiety). This constant fretting over future "what-ifs". So if one has as the central purpose of one's philosophy, showing man how to attain ataraxia (true equanimous happiness), one must attack fearful dispositions head-on. Death is not a special category in this framework, but a central component, treated in the same way as one treated the fear of Gods. Fear of death comes from 1) our relationship with our infinite capacity for desire, and 2) improper understanding (superstitious understanding) of the natural phenomena of death. It is, for him, only through working with natural understanding of ourselves and of life that we learn to pare down desire, make it come into alignment with knowledge of the universe and eliminate the fear of death. Without that one doesn't experience true life-pleasure or true happiness. 

there is an x such that x is the creator of the universe: ∃x[CU(x)] for any x and y, if x is the creator of the universe and y is the creator of the universe, then x=y (i.e. there is at most one thing which is the creator of the universe): ∀x∀y[[CU(x) & CU(y)] → y=x] for every x that is the creator of the universe, x is subject to logic: ∀x[CU(x) → SL(x)]. More briefly put, the claim is that "God is subject to logic" says that some x is such that x is the creator of the universe, and that any y is the creator of the universe only if y = x, and that x is subject to logic: ∃x[CU(x) & ∀y[CU(y) → y=x] & SL(x)] 

If we apply Russell’s theory of (definite) descriptions (“On Denoting” 1905) to the sentence “God is subject to logic”, it can be analysed into a conjunction of the following three: 

If I told you the chair is rickety and unstable due to excessive weathering you would have something to work with regarding the ‘affordances’ (J.J.Gibson) of the chair; namely that you should be wary of sitting on it; using it as a shelf to place a weighty object; as an improvised ladder; a door stop, etc. Alternatively if I told you I’ve just finished applying a coat of clear exterior oil based varnish on it you would know not to touch or use it in the ways mentioned above. Again if I told you the chair is sturdy, clean and available for use, you could then appropriate it in the above mentioned ways. Now image if I told you the chair is physical. Precisely what difference does that make to any potential interactions you might have with the chair? None whatsoever. What difference would it make to assume consciousness is non-physical? - Basically the same; namely nothing. The physical/non-physical distinction is bogus. I’ve found P.W. Bridgman’s ‘operationalism’ (not a term he coined) to be helpful when thinking about such things: $URL$ 

Looking for specific term to describe those ideas which are commonly held without proper justification or questioning? What about "putative"? 

Can anyone one provide counterexamples to the following: The assumption that all human behavioral level activity (i.e. no sub-personal or subconscious processes) can be bifurcated into two kinds of routines (activities, tasks, processes)- those that are representational and those that are non-representational; and that all activity is a combination or ratio of the two. By “non-representational routines” I mean causally efficacious or mechanically productive environmental interactivity. Examples are: making a cup of coffee, cooking an egg, walking your dog, riding your bike, driving your car, throwing a ball, taking a bath, mowing the lawn, building a house, etc. By “representational routine” I mean activity that consists in (linguistically mediated) thought and its communication (production) and or interpretation (consumption). Examples are: armchair rumination, inner mumblings, judging, thinking, believing, realizing, remembering, prediction, expecting, deeming, suspecting, surmising, assuming, conjecturing, planning, goal setting, reasoning, calculating, inferring, imagining, fantasizing, understanding, comprehending, (philosophizing!) etc. Inscription/enunciation: writing, texting, scrawling, sketching, illustrating, blogging, speaking/talking, discussing, debating, lecturing, miming, acting, etc. Reading/interpreting: speech, text, icons, symbols, signs, maps, (technical) drawings, diagrams, graphs, tables, etc. 

For me it helps to frame the topic from the central objective of his philosophy, which one might put as: the liberation of humanity from the enchainment of exploitative modes of production. If we assume this tenant, every act can be judged on the basis of whether or not it leads to greater liberation or greater exploitation. Identity politics is politics pure and simple, BUT the question from a Marxian standpoint is what interests the particular identity serves. Marx was adamantly against nationalist and racial identities, not simply because he disliked nation-states or had a hatred of racial classification theories, but because they both constitute a "superstructure" created by and reinforcing the production relations constituting the economic structure of society. They are epiphenomenal to what is "really" going on in capitalist modes of production. 

Posit that throughout your day you interact with innumerable people, but these people as they see themselves in interaction with you, speak and operate in a sort of identification with the "ego" that resides in them. For Lacan, this "ego" (the image we all have of ourselves and that we speak from when interacting with others) is a fiction. Being a fiction, he doesn't want to make this the target of his focus. It doesn't help him in his endeavor to discover what truly ails or drives a person (a patient, a lover, an enemy etc). The ego isn't ignored however, it's just called the "subject of the statement", an idealized presentation created by the subject of enunciation as a means of reflecting to different others the mirror that enunciative subject unconsciously develops as a coping mechanism for the endless array of social settings and demands this fragile ego tells itself it needs to interact with and survive. The "I", the "ego", the "subject of the statement" is viewed as a signifier and indexical because it allows to understand both it's (the subject's) statements, and ultimately, the subject of the enuciation. The subject of enunciation is what in Freudian terms would be called the unconscious. It is the same subjects that you encounter in your interactions but the parts that is hidden from their ego. It is more precisely all the agencies that speak through the subject of the statement. Your neighbor sees all of his action and utterances as sovereigns acts that he does in full independence of everyone else. What is revealed through the recording of the subject of enunciation is a an amalgam of agencies (forces in Nietzschean terms) and the neighbor is the agent. What this means is that truth is always deceptively divided in the individual. There's the truth as the subject of the statement presents it to itself and to Others, and there is the truth that is only uncovered through the analysis of the statement of the encunciation. E.g. he states in Seminar XI of the Ecrits: 

Within the same "in-carnation" (the taking on of flesh) there is the birth and death of particular types of minds or personalities. One is conscious of each new incarnation in this concept of the reincarnated and thus would not necessitate amnesia. If one has a concept of reincarnation that implies a physical dying and being born as a same self in a new body, there may be quite a few other things that would need to be explained before we even got to the issue of absence of memory of previous lives.
