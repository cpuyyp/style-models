Note that I use the term "liberal" in the context of philosophical liberalism, and not in any political sense. 

There is no philosophical reasoning to approve one and not the other - and I question whether or not such schizophrenic philosophers even exist. Furthermore, both the freedom of speech and the "freedom of deeds" - even in the most liberal circles - have been generally governed by the harm principle in their seminal states. Ergo, free speech does not mean that saying anything anywhere is permitted, just how the concept of liberty or a free society doesn't mean you can go around killing people. I suggest you read John Stuart Mill's On Liberty to familiarize yourself with the concessions of Mill's staunch liberal position. Further reading: 

This is true. By the principle of explosion, if we were to allow for contradictions, anything can follow (e.g. ). So the system is meaningless. 

All four (also Bentham and others) believed, like Aquinas, that a 'covenant from fear was valid,' so fear is, therefore, not coercive. The limits of coercion seem to align closely to what Aquinas laid out. Mill, however, argued that coercion consists of more than violence and threats thereof. He made several leaps: 

I haven't read too much about the subject, and I invite anyone that knows more than I do to correct or amend my answer. Most of the information is synthesized from the SEP article on coercion, but as always, I suggest reading the primary sources. To answer your question, you first need to precisely define coercion as things are not as simple as they appear. There are, generally speaking, several schools of thought regarding coercion, purported by Aquinas, Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Mill, and Nozick. Aquinas - The 'inclination of the will' and non-coerciveness of threats For Aquinas, the result of coercion is the disconnect between what he calls the 'inclination of the will' and the action taken by the agent. Simply put, it looks something like this: 

You ask if it's "absurd" for sets to have two features: (a) a capability to be empty and (b) a capability to contain other sets. With that said, I'm not really sure what you mean by absurd, but you could mean two distinct things: logically incoherent (or inconsistent) OR non-intuitive. If your question is about logical coherence or consistency, the answer is simple: all well-thought-out set theories (like ZFC) are logically coherent. There are many proofs that take care of this. So, as far as we know, there are no logical inconsistencies as far as empty sets or sets of sets are concerned. If your question is about intuition, then it becomes semantically-loaded -- and NOT a question about logic (but maybe about meta-logic). I would argue that the number zero has about as much intuitive force as an empty set: that is, almost none. Negative numbers have even less intuitive force behind them and let's not even bring up imaginary numbers. I'm not familiar with Geldsetzer, but there is a lot of extra work that needs to be done if one wants to show that empty sets and sets-of-sets are not helpful. One couldn't simply say "well it doesn't make sense!". If that were the case, Mary could, just the same, claim that "imaginary numbers make no sense" and there would go an entire field of mathematics (namely, complex analysis). 

There are three key concepts involved in Objectivism when tackling the is-ought problem. They are "Man" (referring to mankind, but in terms of the individual person), "Value", and "Morality." Understanding these concepts, in addition to every concept upon which they depend as Objectivists define them, will help you understand how Objectivism dispenses with the is-ought. Objectivism maintains that concept formation is heirarchical, so these three concepts depend upon a great deal of more fundamental foundational concepts. Defining what every concept that these key concepts depends upon would require hundreds of pages to type out so I'll have to refer you to Leonard Peikoff's work "Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand." Specifically look at the first five chapters which cover Reality, Sense Perception, Volition, Concept Formation, Objectivity, and Reason. Chapters 6-9 really would be required reading as well because these lay the foundation for understanding Man, The Good, Virtue, and Happiness. It's not a very good answer to simply reply "read this book" but because the scope is so broad in this question I've limited the response for the sake of brevity (believe it or not) to the essential interplay between these key concepts at the highest level of abstraction. The important thing to understand is that it is quite impossible to grasp these concepts fully without the prerequisite framework in place upon which Objectivism depends (see Dr. Peikoff's book). Pertaining to the discussion in the comments section of the main question, this is also why Sam Harris falls short of presenting a fully validated framework for an objective ethical system. The concept of morality Rand describes, 

This is also elegant and flexible enough (I believe) that it can't be interpreted to mean "every human life must turn out the exact same and we must all have the same set of values." The real beauty of Objectivism, in my opinion, is that it's presentation of an objective moral framework accounts for and explains the illusion of moral relativism within the context of individualism (within the context of an individuals conditional and hierarchical code of values based on that individuals own life). While the "ultimate value" is always the same (that being ones own "life"), and the basic biological questions of what sustains survival are the same, farther removal from these more basic questions doesn't diminish Objectivism's ability to underscore an ought among alternatives... generally in the form of "If you value X over Y then you Ought to Z." 

Therefore, the TbA does not necessarily contain more rows than the number of open branches in TtA. Proof: (1) is trivial but we can prove that the number of open branches are unbounded, i.e. (2), by induction on the disjunction operator like so: 

It means "metaphysics". He uses the same terminology as Aristotle. In modern (and more specific terms), we can also construe it as "ontology"; that is, the study of being is the most basic ("first") philosophy. 

There's no easy way to fix this. It's a fairly well-known problem and it tends to happen when dealing with "flat" context-free representations -- like event semantics. Jerry Hobbs (of discourse analysis fame) provides one possible solution here. I'm not sure how I feel about it, though. He seems to reference his work on abduction (where there's a knowledge base, KB -- formally, we can represent this as a set of sentences -- that utterances can back-chain to). In the above case, KB would contain things like but not that enapsulate the quirkiness of of monotone-increasing quantifiers (that retain truth value) and monotone-decreasing quantifiers (that do not necessarily retain truth value). There are also other considerations (such as conservativity; read more here) which need to be taken into account if trying to escape context-free semantics. There may be better approaches to solving your "paradox", but I am mostly familiar with Hobbs' work. 

The truth table TbA for A will have 2n rows. The truth tree TtA for A has an unbounded number of open branches. 

Let's look at the last line marked with an asterisk. will yield per Table 1. Similarly, as well as will also yield per Table 1. So, no matter how we decide to commute, we will have to deal with an and the remaining . And will always yield a per Table 1. This is why we observe the odd-even alternation of truth values when all operands are true. It turns out that you don't want to use a in examples like the one in your OP. What you actually want to do is something like or (via DeMorgans) . There is no logical connective that does this since this would require an n-ary connector, e.g. something like which would only work as a function in FOL. Here is an interesting paper discussing the ternary exclusive or. 

To answer your question, "How fatal" I would answer "Not at all." If human beings are understood as living organisms with specific requirements for survival (obvious), and that a code of values (morality) is a requirement and necessarily must be based on the ultimate value of ones own life (including achieving happiness throughout that life)... then the very concepts of what ought a person do can be easily answered and defended based on individual codes of value, within the context of the ultimate value of ones own life. Lets better understand another piece of this quote now. My emphasis in bold, and commentary in ellipses. 

Ayn Rand is alluding to an even more fundamental realization when understanding the concept of value above and questions, "of value to whom and for what." Essentially what she means by "where no alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible" is explained below... 

I'm not really sure what more there is to explain other than to point out that it has nothing to do with the shallow immediate economic gain for the masses and everything to do with the principle of self-ownership. Any shallow immediate economic gain can't have any substance if "you" are nothing but a piece of property owned by the state. 

The term "Randian" is very much a slur in comparison to the term "Objectivist." Think of it like referring to the "Tea Party" people (or really anyone from the right) as "Teabaggers." The perception is that Ayn Rand had the type of personality that did not accept disagreement among the people she associated herself with, and this was true to an extent. One application of the term "Randian" is essentially viewed as students of Objectivism who follow a person, as opposed to ascribing to a philosophy. Some people did (and do) treat Ayn Rand as if she's one of the romanticized perfect characters in her books. The term "cult" is thrown around a lot, and maybe its applicable to some groups of Objectivists. There are a lot of different types of Objectivists you can meet. One particular strain most associated as a "Randian" are the hyper-judgmental, very insecure, socially awkward types. This is obviously a stereotype but some of them do exist in the same severity as the Westboro crowd. The difference between the two isn't in philosophy. In fact I don't think there have been any major schisms on thought. It's not like when the Protestants split off from the Catholics. This is an unofficial label applied subjectively for a number of reasons (ignorance possibly being one of them) to Objectivists. Where most schisms occur is when one Objectivist comes to believe that the actions of another Objectivist are inconsistent with the principles of Objectivism. 

We know that S is not true and S is not false (because we'd run into a paradox) so (implicitly) S cannot be both true and false, therefore the correct answer is d where S is neither true nor false. There are various proofs for this sketch. So the Liar Paradox question is, in fact, solvable in our second form. 

is not a number because happens to be the (a?) unit. And a number, by definition, is a multitude of units. So clearly then, the two are distinct. See Metaphysics 1052b35, Posterior Analytics 72a22, and Topics 108b30. To see why, for example, is a number whereas is a unit, see Metaphysics 1039a15. 

Would this question perplex you as much as your original one? Probably not. The correct color simply isn't a choice. This question is just as unanswerable as yours - no more no less. Why your question seems more interesting is because it makes a key assumption (just like the first incarnation of the Liar Paradox question did - namely, that a statement is either true or false). Specifically, it makes the assumption that the probability of getting a correct answer is 50%. This is incorrect. The probability is, I would argue, mathematically indeterminate. Consider E2: 

Sometimes, primes are used (you can also mix and match, but staying consistent is always a good idea). Here's the set of all blue pens possible: 

Are all not non-coercive according to Aquinas. and are threats and Aquinas doesn't believe threats can possibly be coercive. is not a threat (your company is losing money as we speak!) but it's non-violent so, again, it's not coercive. If you run a government and subscribe to this kind of philosophy, you're in luck. You can do just about anything. Violent torture, punching someone in the face, or otherwise being violent while attempting to undermine someone's 'inclination of the will' is the only way of being coercive. Raising gas prices is the least of your worries. Primary source reading: Summa Theologica. Hobbes, Locke, Kant, Mill - Justice and the role of the state Hobbes, Locke, and Kant mainly thought of coercion as a tool of the state that ought to be conducive to justice. Even Aquinas thought that a governor needed certain coercive powers to ensure order. Hobbes, in particular, thought it to be an essential part of government:
