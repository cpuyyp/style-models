Regarding visualization, I see it as those flags which are all sewed together and become a very long line when we want and take them out to the wind. 

I suppose most (which?) complex $n$-manifolds can be classified by a degree $p\in\mathbb{N}$, that of holomorphic completeness. The simplest way I see it is as the dimension $p-1$ of the compact factor on a product of a compact complex manifold by $\mathbb{C}^{n-p+1}$. I see it also as the maximal dimension (+1) a compact complex submanifold can attain... Stein manifolds=holomorphic 1-complete=holomor. embeddable in some $\mathbb{C}^n$. Andreotti, Cartan, Grauert, Remmert, Stein worked a lot on the notion in the middle of XXth century. A consequence is that every coherent sheaf's $i$-cohomology vanishes for $i\geq p$. But how could we deduce the number of charts from cohomology? For which sheaf? 

What are the units of $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}[x]$? Anything of the form $\pm 1 + 2 x p(x)$ for $p(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ works, and is in fact its own inverse. It's easy to see that any unit must have constant coefficient $\pm 1$ and, if the unit is not constant, it must have highest non-zero coefficient $2$, which lends credence to the above form. I can show that if a unit is its own inverse it must be of this form, but I'm unable to complete the proof. Just in case, I wrote a script to assist me in finding counterexamples to this form and found none. I've also searched and found nothing useful. If my form is correct, then the nontrivial units of $\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ are precisely those elements with multiplicative order 2. Just since I'm curious, is it more than a coincidence that 2 is the only zero divisor of this ring? That is, is there a characterization of the units of $\mathbb{Z}_m[x]$ (or even a more general structure) which includes this observation as a special case? The $\mathbb{Z}_4$ case is problem 3.10 from D.J.H. Garling's A Course in Galois Theory. I've otherwise completed the book and am now going back through to find answers to the questions I wasn't able to finish. Hints are certainly welcome in addition to solutions. Thanks for any help! 

Continuing Joel Fine and Fran Burstall's answer about, indeed "neat", Lebrun's result. Just want to recall that the "orthogonal" twistor space of any $2n$-dimensional pseudo-sphere $SO(2p+1,2q)/SO(2p,2q)$ can be written as $SO(2p+2,2q)/U(p+1,q)$. So the Kähler manifold in question, in case of the 6-sphere, is $SO(8)/U(4)$. One should think of each $j:T_xS^6\rightarrow T_xS^6$ as a linear map on $R^8$ with $j(x)=-1$ and $j(1)=x$. Well, proofs have been rewritten of LeBrun's result. I wish I had more opinion on this: $URL$ 

The solutions to your questions are in Lemmas 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 (page 10) of "Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry", F. Hirzebruch. As you say and those Lemmas confirm, «there is an essentially unique way to associate such a multiplicative sequence to a formal power series, and that all multiplicative sequences come from this». 

Even if David Roberts is right, I'll give an answer; more details my be found in the book R. Brown, P.J. Higgins, R. Sivera, Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids, EMS Tracts in Mathematics Vol. 15, 703 pages. (August 2011). of which a pdf may be downloaded from $URL$ Any crossed module $\mu: M \to P$ has a classifying space $X=B(\mu)$ whose homotopy groups are 0 above dimension 2 and in dimensions 1 and 2 are respectively Coker $\mu$ and Ker $\mu$. A morphism $f$ of crossed modules is a weak equivalence iff the induced map of classifying spaces is a weak equivalence. The homology of a crossed module is defined as the homology of its classifying space. The result asked for is easily obtained by passing to universal covers.

After "dimension" this is the most basic numerical invariant of a manifold and the least explored. I found this reference some years ago: I. Bernstein, "On Imbedding Numbers of Differentiable Manifolds", Topology, Vol. 7, pp. 95-109. 

Is there a classification of the holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles $\pi:E\rightarrow M$, over a given complex Hermitian manifold, which are projectively flat and the curvature is proportional to the Kähler 2-form: $$ R^Ee=s\,\omega\otimes e \ ,\ \ \forall e\in E\ .$$ Projectively flat means the curvature 2-form of the Chern connection on $E$ is a multiple $\alpha 1_E$ of the identity of $E$ by a $(1,1)$-form $\alpha$ (see e.g. famous book S.Kobayashi, Differential Geometry of Complex Vector Bundles, Math. Soc. of Japan, Iwanami Schoten and Princeton UP, 1987). But what about when $\alpha=s\omega$, a scalar multiple of the Kähler 2-form not necessarily closed? And what about if it is closed? If $E=TM$ and $M$ is Kähler, and, moreover, $s$ is constant, then the answer is the constant holomorphic sectional curvature manifolds. Thank you very much for answers. 

As the title says, I'm trying to find ideals of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ generated by $n$ elements and no fewer. I suspect $(2^k, 2^{k-1} x, 2^{k-2} x^2, ..., x^k)$ is generated by no fewer than $n=k+1$ elements, but I haven't been able to prove it. I've tried successively replacing single elements in a finite generating set in an attempt to zero out the constant order coefficients of all but one generator, but I'm not able to ensure I've done so while preserving the ideal. If I could do this, an inductive proof would follow immediately. I've also tried to make other examples but none seemed as promising as this one. This one also generalizes the neat example $(2, x)$ (generated by at least 2 elements) which shows explicitly that $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is not a PID. I've searched and found nothing useful. This is problem 3.7 from D.J.H. Garling's A Course in Galois Theory. The chapter itself seems to be a standard introduction to commutative algebra with an eye towards polynomial rings over fields. I hope the question isn't too basic for this site; it's my first post. I've gone through the book and done every problem except for (parts of) around a dozen, including this one. He gives questions that appear to rely on more advanced material than was presented in the text from time to time, so perhaps this question is easy for someone more experienced in algebra, or maybe I'm just missing something. Any help is appreciated! 

I'll make this another answer as it tries to be explicit in answer to Henry Wilton's comments and questions. Certainly the pushout statement given shows how $\Pi_2 K$ is determined by the $\Pi_2$ of $L,M,N$ when $K=L \cup M$, $N= L \cap M$. This is clearly directly analogous to the usual Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, and like that, has some connectivity conditions, as stated. A useful case is when $L^1 = M^1$ and so $ =K^1$ (not necessarily the $1$-skeleta). Then the theorem implies that $$\Pi_2 K\cong \Pi_2 L \circ \Pi_2 M$$ the coproduct in the category of crossed $\pi_1 K^1$-modules. This has a rather explicit description given in the paper Topology 23 (1984) 337-345., where the top group is a factor group of a semidirect product of the top groups of the parts. Some cases of explicit descriptions of $\pi_2 K$ are given there. Another useful case is when $N=N^1, M=M^1$. Then the pushout, $\Pi_2K$ is called the crossed module induced from the crossed module $\Pi_2 L$ by the morphism of fundamental groups $\pi_1 N^1 \to \pi_1 M^1$. My papers with Chris Wensley are about explicit calculations of this, including that of $\pi_2 K$. One result is that if all else is finite, then the induced crossed module is finite. One example given in the paper in J. Symbolic Comp is to take the crossed module induced from the normal inclusion $C_3 \to S_3$ by the inclusion $S_3 \to S_4$. The answer is a crossed module $SL(2,3) \to S_4$ with kernel $C_2$. Using classifying spaces one gets a result on a mapping cone. That is, we compute this $\pi_2 K \cong C_2$ by computing the $2$-type as a crossed module of finite nonabelian groups. Hope that helps.
