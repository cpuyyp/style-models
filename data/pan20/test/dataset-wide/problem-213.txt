If speed is your goal then the best you can get is to add at least one zero to 20-50 years and you have something possible with really advanced technology (really cheap interstellar transport). You just need to add oxygen and bacteria. Start with a world nearly identical to the early earth, as close as possible, with only very earliest forms of life, (barely having cells). Then spread your own bacteria and algae on an industrial scale, let them liberate oxygen, and wipe out the native stuff on their own. That will get you oxygen in the atmosphere. 2-300 years is possible with enough mechanical help. Your real issue is not making oxygen it is using/filling up enough the rocks/sediment that will bind up all the free oxygen, it will be constantly sucking the oxygen out of the atmosphere. You are not making the same level of oxygen as the modern atmosphere you are making about ten times that at a minimum. If your people can import billions of tons of oxygen then can speed it up my an order of magnitude. It took at least a billion years to do this on earth, if you import huge quantities of oxygen (electrolyse a few comets) you can speed this up, kill off the native life, and probably see some really cool gigantic sized fires all at once. Then you want to spend a few decades or so building soils using more imported bacteria, Then you can start importing plant and animal life and living on the surface, taking another few decades. All together you are talking anywhere from 3-500 years, maybe half that with really advanced technology (lots of automation and bulk interstellar travel). People can start living on the planet right at the beginning as long as they are living in domes or other enclosed environments with greenhouses for making food. They can even use their waste products to speed up the terraforming process if the sterilize it first. Alexander's mention of the snowball earth time period works as well, although it will be a lot harder to wipe out life that advanced, though this could provide additional material for the story with persistent pockets of the native life. Of course you will have a lot of protest about wiping out native life. 

Another invention - "muscular skin", fibrils normally contracted and desiccated when dormant - which is their "use state". The fibrils relax upon feeding with a special nutrient (feed can only be administrated within a narrowish temperature range/env conditions) and when relaxed the scale can be easily extracted - but is not loose enough to fall on it's own. The skin also require feeding periodically (every 2-3 days?), otherwise the wear cause by the relative movement/friction will cause the skin to tear. Bonus - make the scales a by-product of the skin metabolism, something like hair/nails (keratin or chitin stuff). Advanced scenario - make it a living thing in symbiosis with the wearer and feeding from the wearer's blood stream. The skin is grown specially for the host, cannot change the her/him on the danger of anaphylactic shock for both the host and the skin within minutes. If you can give the skin some nervous system enough for perception, instincts and reaction (toughen when detects fear, amplify the strength of fast movements, etc), such a skin would try to protect the wearer as the only source of food. 

Consider something like the leaf cutter ant, which eat nothing but fungus, they evolved agriculture long before humans existed. They harvest plant material to farm the fungus and have been doing it for so long they can barely digest anything else. They even produce a biological antibiotic to kill off anything that might compete with the fungus. It would be easy to see a strong evolved disgust response against even trying to eat other food in such a species. They farm something to feed the fungus which can be fed a variety of things, then only eat the fungus, that would allow them to evolve behavioral plasticity since they have to find things in new environments to feed the fungus. Plus fungus agriculture has evolved at least three separate times in insects so you completely justify it on an alien species. Any advanced civilization could develop the technology to synthesize their food, but there are many reasons they would not bother, especially on a large scale. 

There are scenarios where it can work without changing the history: transport aluminium spoons and crowns, get back the DNA of Michelangelo and Nero - insert a passage of Newton being nagged by a microrobotic mosquito probe; or just fingerprints of past celebrities for collectors. Speaking of DNA samples of the past: how about female/gynoid agents seducing and collecting genuine reproductive genetic material for those willing to pay enough to have a child of a male celebrity of the history? (maybe it can work for ova as well?) Any ethical conflicts for a story here? On the line of just the empty vanity of the customers, the children are missing the "nurture" side to realize the potential of the "nature"? 

it doesn't matter how altruistic they are, the problem arises as soon as there is a problem with more than one solution and not enough resources to try both, now you have conflict and you need conflict resolution. your people will have different perspectives and thus favor different solutions, and this will not be a rare occurrence. direct democracy won't work unless they are spending most of every day voting, and it will be very slow on top of that. You need some specialized decision makers, which means you need a way to select such people, which is basically what a political system is. Plus you have already hinted at an additional source of conflict, local needs, not everything has a local or easy to see solution. lack of information will exacerbate both these effects, as no one person can be well versed in everything there just is not enough time, so for many decisions they won't understand the situation, which again leads to a political system out of sheer necessity. They may not have leaders, but they still have specialists who make policy decisions, which means they need a way to pick such people. 

There was an answer, now deleted, regarding the energy resulted from the annihilation of a proton with a anti-proton and the comparison with the energy resulted from fusion. Too bad it was deleted, because there are conditions in which the answer was valid. In the event of matter/anti-matter annihilation, the energy is likely to be emitted in any direction. And it's many orders of magnitude higher than the chemical bond energy. Which means a gamma emitted towards the planet is very likely to vaporize some anti-matter and eject it in space towards the cloud of matter above. Would this anti-matter be electrically charged (very likely at the level of energy we are speaking), the magnetic fields will deviate the ejected antimatter in areas where the cloud wasn't repulsed by the "initial" explosion. With enough density of normal matter in the cloud, you may assist to a cascade effect causing a gamma storm engulfing the entire surface of the planet. Which bring us to the important parameters which describe what happens on the anti-matter planet - the (absolute) density and the distribution thereof for the matter cloud. 

I could see a worm with two curved hard plates something similar to shipworms, just with offset plates and a twisted motion. the question is why are they burrowing in hard soil? there will not be a lot to eat in compacted soil, since compacted soil doesn't have much in the way of spaces for water and air that things need to live. I am thinking a digging apparatus something like an antique post hole digger crossed with a bunghole auger. with a motion where they push forward with a slight twist slowly carving away the soil. energetically it not that different than normal burrowing, you might need to give the worm so form of soft cartilaginous pseudo-skeleton in order to generate the torque. but you really don't need to have no sun to have things live underground there is life for miles under the earth's surface. 

Those 2 alone would allow to feed the entire population with only 7-10% of it working in agriculture. Of course, knowledge on selective breeding and whatnot are going to help, but given the two above you can skip highly productive breeds/varieties in the first phase . Hydroponics? Last time I checked, nobody is growing staple (corn/wheat/rice, potatoes, sugar cane/beet, oil crops) in hydroponics condition - it's simply too expensive even today. 

In between, various other scenarios - regular pulses being improbable, though not impossible - e.g. still happen if the "cloud" is instead a "galactic stream of cosmic dust - after repulsing a "wave" by a gamma burst, the stream renews the density of the cloud with other incoming matter. 

Do what the government did, buy a hotel, the more remote or resort like the better, build an addition on the hotel, maybe a new wing or kennel, at the same time (at night) build a secret bunker underneath it. All the moving and excavation just gets lost in the normal legitimate construction, they had to dig to build a stable foundation anyway. This is actually a pretty common way to build bunkers. Once it is completed it is easy to hide people coming and going among the normal guests, deliveries, staff, ect. 

capability to use the control/use the energy to work the fields - do you realize how much infrastructure you need to create and get to run agricultural machinery? Conjure into existence steel/metallurgy, petrol, roads/transport, etc. to get "modern farming". If you get those, there's little difference from the "modern world" (cca late 1800) fertilizers - Haber-Bosch process is probably the other factor that is needed for the modern agriculture. 

See also: Herbig-Haro objects - protostars for which the accretion disk falling into the forming stars ionizes and the created magnetic field ejects polar jets at "supersonic" speeds. Those jets collide with the surrounding nebula and produces EM emission in visible spectrum (recombination and bow shocks) without the corresponding (for a mature star) IR part of the spectrum. How's the above relevant? Well, astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics is complex enough to allow a pulsating phenomenon (caused by the described configuration) to actually occur in the right conditions. It is also conveniently complex enough to allow for quite a fair bit of plausible hand-waving; feel free to do it I don't think someone will jump to say: "No, that's impossible", especially after accepting the presence of an anti-matter planet. To asses the safety of handwaving, a google search for "pulsating bow shock" brings in something like: 

There will be several effect and acuity is the least of them. Color will be a bigger effect than acuity, birds see more base colors than we do. Many things will suddenly be the wrong color, especially blues, blacks, and purples (to us). Additionally there will be several completely new colors we don't even have words for since they can see into the ultraviolet. Diurnal birds also have worse night vision than humans (fewer rods), so your guy will likely experience night blindness. Birds have something called a Pecten oculi which supplies nutrients to the eye and will mean they have a bigger blind spot, this will not have much effect unless they are close to something and looking up at the same time however. Oddly this may also be allow birds to detect magnetic fields, how this would translate to vision is anyone's guess. Visual acuity will not have much effect. The amount of the brain devoted to processing visual information is not any larger and with the increase in incoming information (new color and magnetics) it has to process your human may actually experience a lose in acuity, not a gain.
