A lot of the things that can crystallize inside the human body can cause excruciating pain if they crystallize in the right spot, or if you eventually need to pass or excrete the crystal at some point. Think of things like: 

What about community service hours? You could even make the punishment fit the crime in some cases. If the person is found guilty of jaywalking, make them to spend their days off as a crossing guard. If the person is found guilty of littering, make them to pick up trash on the side of a highway. And so on... This kind of alternative sentencing is already becoming a little more common in some juvenile and misdemeanor courts in the US. 

At this point in history I suspect a draft would do it... (and yes I'm aware of the pun there) Forced conscription with the current political climate, and with Vietnam in recent memory would probably inspire the sort of split you're looking for. Confidence in the federal government is pretty low right now, and even more right leaning states would likely be hesitant to send their young people to fight under the current commander in chief... 

Depends on which definition of "efficient" you're looking at. Efficient: achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense. If you're really shooting for minimum wasted effort or expense, couldn't you just do nothing and wait around? On a long enough timeline most all civilizations are ultimately doomed; the sun will super nova or burn out eventually, large asteroid strikes happen every so often, and so on... 

"Music", at least in popular depiction, was fairly common on early battlefields. Often simple music, think drums/pipes/horns, were used to coordinate formations and motivate troops. Realistically musicians were protected by not being the front line. In formation the drummers, pipers, and what have you, would be in the rear. Probably with the honor guard and standard bearers. These instruments being loud by nature even without amplification would still carry over and be heard as needed. Scottish pipe and drum is a fairly good example: $URL$ $URL$ In modern times music is routinely used for recruitment. See: $URL$ Note the "epic feel" Beyond "organized militaries" music is very often used to inspire and motivate. A couple of personal favorites: $URL$ $URL$ 

$\Delta V$ required to raise Earth to Jupiter's orbit $= 3.4 \frac{km}{sec}$. Divide the $\Delta V$ requirement by the amount of $\Delta V$ provided by a single interaction: $$N_{interactions} = \frac{\Delta V_{required}}{\Delta V_{Interaction}} = \frac{3.4}{4.4 \cdot 10^{-4}} = 7,624 interactions$$ Vesta flybys of Earth. At an average of 5.2 years per flyby, this will take you $$7,624 \times 5.2 = 39,648 years$$ But you can significantly accelerate the process by using more than one asteroid to transfer momentum.

Desert Survival suit Uses passive nanomaterials to condense water out of the air as well as allow sweat to evaporate keeping the body cool. Also uses passive color changing to reflect heat back into the environment during the day. Uses passive color changing to warm the body during the night. Uses nanomaterials to keep a static charge facing out to keep sand and dirt off / away from the suit wearer. Skinsuit Uses material elastic properties to maintain positive pressure on the body. Wicking ability allows the wearer's sweat to carry heat away from the body. Passive color control helps reflect the heat from direct sunlight away from the wearer. Built in electronics provide sensor suit and radio / data reception to the suit wearer. Space skinsuit 

Considering that the "you" walking into the personality upload facility is fully aware that it stands a 50% chance of being the biological entity or the uploaded entity when its done, does the law require a 50% split of assets or allow the one walking in to dictate the terms for the two walking out? Perhaps it requires a minimum level of support for each entity. 

Imagine a setting in which small caches of learning materials were stored in such a way to survive and be recovered. A very knowledgeable person stumbling upon such a cache, might be able to use that recovered knowledge to improve his life. Of course the written language in such materials would diverge widely from what was in common use. The application of the knowledge in those books would also diverge widely from what was in common use. Imagine a person inventing simple electrical and mechanical devices. In some ways this would appear to be identical to the learned wizards of fantasy settings. Having to learn an ancient language, recovering lost wisdom, controlling vast and mysterious powers that can potentially kill the careless. Yup, sounds like wizardry to me. And like wizardry in a fantasy setting some will fear, avoid, and/or persecute the "magic wielders" while others will try to bend those powers to their own needs/wants/wishes. Putting it another way, people will still be people. As such there will be good people, bad people, and the majority who are somewhere in between the two. 

Umm... The obvious problem would be the death of the joke creator (as depicted in the Monty Python sketch) If such a thing were possible, how does the creator protect themselves from their own creation? How would they know that they had created a lethal joke? How could they share their creation? Luckily no such thing is possible without other significant factors, such as the victim having a pre-existing heart condition or breathing problems... This is stretching things pretty far though. A victim so predisposed to death will die under any significant strain, even a mildly entertaining joke may put them at risk. 

Nearly everything else will be frozen, dry, or canned. All of your meats and most of your veggies, will probably be IQF (individually quick frozen) Don't expect to find much in the way of unmixed dry ingredients like flour. Most pancakes, waffles and that sort of thing come to the diner as a "just add water" mix. Which brings us to the primary problem... A diner simply wont function without running water for more than a few hours. Most restaurants don't carry large stocks of bottled water, and even fewer carry other bottled beverages. Sure you may have a few gallons of fruit juice, but soda will probably come from a bag-in-box dispenser (wont work without running water) the coffee machine is likely plumbed in and the tea most likely is as well. So... If you had a staff of 6 and say 12 customers at the time of transport, all of the water you have on hand will probably be depleted within a day, maybe two days if you rationed carefully and didn't use it for making waffles. Sorry to paint such a bleak picture, but on the up shot you would probably have enough food, even without refrigeration to last a few weeks. Keep in mind that commercial freezers are really well insulated and inside a typical diner freezer you would find a near solid wall (a few feet thick) of frozen food. 

Except for smaller number of stops, an exact solution is not computationally efficient. Many approximations and heuristics exist that should yield good answers. Unfortunately, I can't find the paper that discusses this but some researchers have found a method of finding an exact solution and it involves a "liquid computer". They build a clear plastic model of the routes and then push fluids through the model. The water going through the shortest route makes it to the end the fastest. I assume various dyes are injected so they can determine the "winning" route. However, there are many attempts at developing numerical methods that imitate the water flow method of solving the problem. 

Why are some systems still running? BtB discovers that civilization fell with individuals performing heroically to set up systems to maintain services for nyone who might have not received a lethal dose. Some systems (say nuclear or hydro power, water systems, etc.) might be configured to work for a while without human intervention. How long this might be is anyone's guess: days, weeks, months but probably not more than a year or two. Remember that fossil fueled systems run down faster because no one is fueling them. Read Earth Abides by George Stewart for a treatment of what this might feel like. In it Stewart postulates a plague that wipes out humanity while a geology student is on a field trip to the American Southwest (another possibility). Possible sources of radiation 

In short (links to follow as I find time to put them in). Coil guns (aka Gauss guns) Have a higher max projectile velocity. Powerful switches alternate the electromagnetic poles in the drive coils as the projectile passes through the coils. This requires high voltage, high amperage, high speed electrical switches. Researchers have been trying to build these for decades with only moderate success. 

I suspect some more or less "settle" as these deadlines approach, if the deadlines are significantly delayed or removed, well obviously you wouldn't see that. These issues could also play a role in marriage/divorce rates. 

Advancement in cigarette manufacturing technology Perhaps motivated by lagging sales and government pressure big tobacco finally gets around to producing cigarettes that are every bit as tasty and addictive, but substantially less or even non lethal. Overnight millions of anxious, agitated former smokers light up again. 

Much like most humans, this will probably depend on the individual. Some elderly folks seem to keep up rather well, they adapt to new technology, they enjoy new music, they try new foods, and so on... They enjoy variety and find interest in the new. Others cling to "the good old days", modern times seem somehow corrupt and lacking compared to their rose colored version of their youth. Much like how members of "The Greatest Generation" looked back on the Great Depression and World War II "you know people had moral fiber back then... hardworking, dependable" or how the "Baby Boomers" look back at the swinging 60's "remember when sex was safe and motorcycles were dangerous?" I would guess that you would find the same diversity in vampires. Some would miss the good old days, when hiding the leftovers from dinner was as easy as tossing them on the plague cart. While others would probably enjoy the modern urban subcultures where vampires could hide out in the open. 

First lets look at another reason that a plant might want to produce fire: A great many parasitic insects are attracted to CO2 and most organic substances release some amount of CO2 when burned. So producing CO2 may create a small advantage in attracting insects for pollination and/or consumption. Next how might a plant self ignite: According to several sources; cotton rags when soaked in linseed oil can spontaneously combust, under the right conditions. 

There really isn't a practical way unless you are discussing truly massive scaled terraforming. Freeze it out Set up a sunshade arrangement to drop the planetary temperature low enough to freeze the water, then "mine" it and launch it into space. Understand that you'll need a super efficient method of surface - space transport. You'll need something as efficient as a space elevator and this structures efficiency could be improved by simultaneously transporting goods from space - surface and using that energy to power the lifting of water. Burn it off My other suggestion would be the opposite approach. Use a massive orbital mirror to concentrate sunlight on the surface of the planet and "burn" the water off. Note that this wouldn't work very well over short periods of time for a planet as massive as Earth. However, if the planet is roughly half as massive, its hold on water is a bit tenuous and you might be able to heat the water enough to significantly its outflow over non-geologic time scales. I haven't run the math though so I might be incorrect. In general, this is going to wreck the biosphere more thoroughly than the "freeze it out" method. However, it is a less active approach - no mining and transport workers required, just apply the giant space heater. Note: this approach works better if you focus that sunlight into a very narrow beam and heat a small column of water to a tremendously high temperature rather than baking the entire planet at some lower temperature. I believe the Jean's escape mechanism scales linearly to the maximum gas temperature. It also helps to apply this heat to the top levels of the atmosphere rather than lower down - so perhaps regularly "salting" the upper atmosphere with low albedo dust would help the process. 

Any well organized force could easily defeat a mass of mindless drones, even if the odds are two to one and they have to resort to hobbling them because they can't exactly be killed. Half a zombie is still a unit with no legs and not a credible threat. The Romans proved this over and over again in antiquity. Military history and tactics matter considerably. If your individual units aren't capable of basic decision making they're pitiful cannon fodder and will be quickly mowed down by any half capable, organized force. "Alright boys, take them out at the knees, we don't have time for this!" 

I think it would be a safe assumption that flight would be one of the dragons' early adaptations. Developing wings after getting too big would be troublesome for dragons who sprouted wings before the wings became strong enough or large enough to provide lift, the precursor to useable flight wings would be a liability for a large dragon and probably wouldn't pass on very well. So, your prehistoric dragon would likely start off as a small, canopy dwelling predator with rudimentary gliding capabilities, like a flying squirrel. At this stage the going adaptations for avoiding dragon attacks would be: 

This was touched on in your horse question, but with infinite vegetation you could have near infinite livestock. Goats may provide a good solution for both keeping some land clear of grasstatoe and providing your people with a source of protein and surplus goats, cheese, and hides for trade. This may sound like a joke but in some places you can rent goats for land clearing. 

I'm picturing a world with a permanent, dark, overcast sky, but I'm wondering how dark it can be before photosynthesis is no longer an option. It looks like there are a good number of plants that have good shade tolerance, but I can't find any real information on the bottom limit. There also appear to be, a few plants that don't need to photosynthesize at all. The closest analog I can think of is the oceanic zones, photic and aphotic. Photic being the top layer of a body of water where most, if not all, of your photosynthesis is happening. Aphotic being too deep for enough light to penetrate. Apparently the photic zone:
