Have you talked to Alice privately? Praising her in front of the team could help, but only if the cause of poor performance is one of a small number of things (feeling under-appreciated, insecure, generally demoralized, etc). Getting to the root of the problem first should help you understand how to boost performance. 

The best advice I was ever given, was to make a resignation letter short and sweet. Start with the fact you're resigning, then take a sentence or two to say something positive, and finish off with any important details. Even if you left in bad spirits, leaving saying positive things keeps potential future options open for you. Sounds like you're going for this approach. To respond to your specific example: 

Raise standards of performance back to what they were. In team meetings, focus on the achievements of the team, not the individual. In private meetings, focus on where you want the team member to be, and the next steps to get there. And don't gloss over a backwards slide -- acknowledge you've noticed a change, reassure them you want to help improve their performance, and ask how you can help. 

That specific sentence loses some of its weight because it sounds overly emotional and hyperbolic. Would "nobody else" really hire an entry level programmer? Of course not, just nobody else that you applied to. It would give more weight if you play up the potential risk to the company and make it more personal, or even leave the last bit out. Such as: 

After two hours, go to one of them and casually ask how is it going. Or, make it random. What if they are on social media with their friends. If they understand they must be accountable, they will start to straighten up. 

Send a friendly email. Thank them for giving you the opportunity to intern with them. Say you received another opportunity that more closely aligns with your career goals. Mention this isn't a goodbye, but really a hello, and hope you cross paths with them in future. 

Your management is also at fault. They should understand that managing interns (interns, not seasoned employees who have seen the world) takes time and dedication. To re-iterate 

I've been asked to do mentorship in my organization (City Government in USA), which is rewarding because I get to teach eager employees (from other departments for 2 months at a time). On the other hand, I've come across 1 or 2 people (one is hard to fire, other has permanent City title and cannot be fired) who've, lets say have given me a run for my money. Now I am volunteering as officer role at Toastmasters to get "hands-on" leadership training, and I'm dealing with an especially toxic person (acts nice to your face, but does opposite when you are away). And this person happens to work at my organization (different building though) Question: Please recommend books that will enhance my understanding. Perhaps show me how to create healthy boundaries, i.e. a ship is surrounded by water, but the ship is built so water does not get in.

As such, you should make sure your employer understands what's going on before you start, but it's not worth mentioning at interview time. Interviews are there for understanding whether you have the skills and attributes necessary for the job, and are a relatively early stage in the hiring process. Temporary conditions should have no bearing on the decisions at interview time. Since there's no guarantee you will get the position, you don't need to disclose medical issues, just as you don't need to disclose time off you may need when you interview. That being said, it would show good faith to bring it up if you get an offer, and before you accept. That way, they know what's coming before they hire you. 

4 weeks worth of reduced productivity is a very important thing to make sure your employer understands. You want to make sure: 

It's impossible to know what the hiring managers were thinking. However let me tell you a story. I was once in a position in a small IT department that had recently had some turnover. There were two vacated positions outside of the team I ran, and my boss and I agreed that the best approach would be to absorb those positions and their respective responsibilities into my team / team's service portfolio as a whole. So I posted the positions, and scheduled a round of interviews for the first round of applicants. I was in the middle of interviews when my boss told me he changed his mind. Instead, he was going to form a new team with these two positions, reporting to him, and the responsibilities would be shared differently across the two teams (meaning the skillets for the openings no longer matched what I was recruiting for). So I had no choice but to call up strong candidates, one of whom was 2 hours away from his scheduled interview, and tell them that the position was no longer going to be filled. I wanted to say more, but giving more detail would have reflected poorly on the organization. Point is, sometimes plans change without warning, and sometimes potential employers can't give much detail why. 

Unpopular opinion time: From both the company's point of view, and your managerial career's point of view, there is only one possible path forward: You have to report this to HR, even if your subordinate does not want you to. As a manager, your primary duty is to protect the company's interests. The company needs to know that one of their employees has raped (!) another employee, since this has "lawsuit" written all over it, and you will be negligent in your duties as a manager if you don't tell HR. What's more, if the company ever finds out that you were aware but did not report this, you will now be in hot water. Yes, I'm aware it's uncomfortable to go against your subordinate's explicit wishes, but while it's rational for her to be scared of him, it's probably in her own best interest as well that the company deals with the incident. Given the severity of the accusation, if there's any sort of evidence to back it up, odds are pretty high the harasser will be fired. Even if the investigation cannot conclude anything, in any half decent company she (and you) will be protected from any form of retaliation -- and if the company/accused is not decent and retaliates against her anyway, well, that's more fodder for a lawsuit. 

Depends completely on your employment contract. In the IT world, it's not uncommon for companies to claim ownership of everything you create, even outside office hours and on your personal equipment, if it relates to or could potentially compete with the company's business. For example, while I don't work there I gather this is standard for Amazon, and good luck finding a line of work they're not somehow involved in: $URL$ 

How does this benefit the team, the organization How does it benefit you, so the result is that is benefits the team, the organization 

In your case, tell them what you expect from them, i.e. I expect code by this time, with zero-errors. Sometimes, people need structure, other times, people will find excuse not to work. 

Well here is the problem. Lot of people are scared of sharing information, also known as collaboration. But I think if more you share, more others will eventually share with you, or more opportunities will open. And certainly the coworkers will start to warm up, and you can find the relationship beneficial. If you have too much work on your hands, you can get their help. Do this slowly and steady, so you all feel comfortable. 

Are these coworkers straight out of college? Perhaps college interns. Sometimes they behave that way because they don't understand real-world. Or they can just be annoying people 

Can you do self-learning on your free time? From there, you can show more of your knowledge, your employer can give more responsibilities, and eventually a raise. Maybe you can strategize eventually starting your own small business, i.e see Small Business Administration. I don't believe they do background checks. And it doesn't have to be in IT. See what else you are good at. This was a shot in the dark. Best wishes! 

Ask what have they done to solve the problem so far. Lot of times, people can troubleshoot their own problem and learn in the process. If your friend attempted to find a solution and was unsuccessful, then offer your time to help 

Yes, it is common, but by no means universal. If they're the ones asking you to move overseas, visa support & costs are nearly always a part of the deal, and the family would typically be included in this case. If you're applying for jobs locally, though, it's a bit of a question mark. The employer would certainly sponsor the visa, and would likely pay your fees (compared to your salary, the cost is likely small), but whether the family is included would be a matter of negotiation. And of course you'll be at a disadvantage compared another candidate who doesn't need a visa, not just because of the the cost, but because of the avoided hassle and uncertainty (what if the visa doesn't come through?). Sponsorship for more expensive/optional endeavours like permanent residence or citizenship will also vary from company to company. When I applied for permanent residence in Australia, my employer at the time sponsored me and covered half the (sizable) bill, but with the stipulation that I'd have to repay it if I left within a year. 

Yeah, that is pretty ridiculous. I would let them use the room until you find a "paying" internal tenant, and make it very clear to them that you're doing a favor and they may need to vacate at very short notice, and to the rest of the office that the room is still available. 

In larger companies, promotions and role changes are often entirely separate things, and it's not possible to do a "diagonal transfer" that involves getting a promotion and moving to a new role at the same time. Open roles, even internally, have fixed level requirements and a Level 2 Widget Fiddler is not going to be eligible for a Level 3-4 Discombobulator role unless they get a promotion to Level 3 in their current role first. Whether this is fair or sensible is another question, but the general thinking is that by being promoted to a level of responsibility in one role, they've demonstrated that they have the soft skills (leadership etc) needed for the same level in other roles as well. This is particularly the case for more senior management positions, where soft skills are often paramount. Short of quitting for a less rigid company, it's unlikely you can do anything about this in the short term. In the medium to long term, you should be working with your manager on promotions that will enable these career opportunities. Also, large companies anchor their salaries on what other companies are paying. (And yes, this is recursive.) If the market average salary for Fiddlers is higher than Discombobulators, a Level 2 Junior Fiddler may well earn more than the Level 4 Senior Discombobulator. 

I disagree. There are infinite ways one can always show they are adding value, build relationships. As long as there is a lot of work to do, a lot of things to innovate, then their is an ocean of such opportunity, one needs to ask themselves how else they can contribute. 

There is a scholarship program for current employees in our company to go to graduate school. The Graduate school in question require letter of recommendation from supervisor via online. It's been more than 10 years I've been in University, and back then when I asked for letter of recommendations, the person would give hardcopy in sealed envelope. Now, Graduate school website says: 

It probably made you look bad. They say pig likes to fight in mud, only difference is pig enjoys it. Pig is your coworkers in this case. 

So far, I have my current supervisor, and past supervisor whom I can ask. How do I approach? Do I simply say, please register for this online system, or do I create an account and password for them, ask them to log in and change it. Is there anything else I should do Bottom Line: How to make it easy for supervisors past and present to provide letter of recommendation for this online format? 

Next time you encounter this type of behavior you can POLITELY ask "how well do you think I fit for this position?" ... perhaps they will be attentive and/or give courtesy to end interview early. But don't discount disrespectful interviewers. I had this type of experience once and was STILL given job offer 

Flash drive?! This is the 2010s, the standard place to post your personal projects is online on github.com. Then you can just add a link to your profile in your resume. And if you're not familiar with Git, if you work in IT, you probably should be. Edit: But on rereading your question, I agree with the other answers that they're almost certainly looking for experience working in large projects, not the code you've written. 

Negotiate after you receive the offer. If they select you over the other applicants, they obviously think you're the best candidate and thus worth more than the rest. They've already invested enough time in evaluating you that they're not just going to walk away if you ask for more, so the absolute worst case is that they don't raise the offer. For much more on this topic, see Salary Negotiation on Kalzumeus, specifically the "When Does A Salary Negotiation Happen?" bit (but you really should read the whole thing). And feel free to negotiate over the phone with HR, but get the details of any offers in writing before you accept anything! 

I would not bring it up during the "core" of the interview. However, if the interview went well and they get to the "so do you have any questions about the role?" part, it might be appropriate to bring it up, particularly if it's unclear if there is any remuneration. That said, especially in larger companies the person interviewing you well may have no idea about the compensation. All things being equal, I would advise that you wait until you have a solid offer on the table, and that if possible, you get offers from several companies so that you have a stronger negotiating position. Also remember that the primary value of an internship is not the money paid out during those few months, but the experience earned and the doors it opens to a well-paid future job.
