I have personally experienced that precise symptom, from mountain biking rides or from commuting rides. Although I am not sure what causes it, I have observed that when it happens to me, I have ridden up steep inclines in "too high" gears while remaining seated or seated too far back on the saddle. For these reasons I have changed my pedaling technique a bit, using a lot more gearshifts. I can also recall that my problems appeared when I changed my saddle for a narrower one, so later I found that to accommodate my sit bone, I tended to sit further back, so I could catch a wider part of the saddle. No doubt I changed my saddle's fore/aft position by half an inch towards the front. In some rare occasions I have gotten hip pain from riding in too tight, non stretching pants, like jeans, specially carrying objects in my pockets. I suspect the problem here is the pressure the clothing excepts over the hip joint while flexing up the leg. Objects like phone, keys or tools in the pockets make this worse. Check if any of these issues is affecting you and, if you find so, try changing one thing at a time, to see if something helps. 

Yet another possible cause is frame flex. In some frames the shifter cable is routed under the bottom bracket with part of the shifting cable exposed. In this kind of kike, the cable has not full length casing, instead the casing goes from the shifter to some cable stop in the frame, then the inner cable goes to another cable stop and enters another casing length finally going to the derailleur. Some frames can flex under stress and pedaling hard from a full stop can be enough to momentarily deform the frame so the distance between certain cable stops changes, thus changing the cable position inside the casing which in turn changes derailleur position by just millimeters. This position change is too small to complete a full gear shift, but is enough to make the chain "want to shift", hence the rider can feel skipping or "ghost shifting". The solution for this is either create or use a different cable routing (Some frames may have alternate cable routing) or simply use a single casing from the shifter to the derailleur.

Here in my country is kind of difficult to get certain types of handlebars, but it is easy to get flat and riser mountain type handlebars and standard types of road drop bars. So I'm investigating whether it is possible to purposefully bend a straight handlebar to have it in another shape. Can it be done with common store-bought tools? If not, I can take it to a metal working shop and get it bent there? Will it be safe? In particular, I'd like to turn straight handlebar into a bullhorn shaped one. I'd like to have this done on aluminum but i'm not sure whether a finished handlebar can be bent. A second option is to make the handlebar out of steel pipe that is easily bought locally. However to install it on a bike shims will be needed to make up for the "bulge" that handlebars have in the clamp area. I have currently configured my bike with a short straight handlebar fit with bar ends and it works pretty well for my purposes, but I'd like to have a rounded curve instead of the sharp angle that the bar and bar ends have. I currently do not have the means to buy a ready-made bullhorn via internet by myself, but if I had, the hassle of shipping, customs taxes and other annoyances made me wonder if making my own is feasible. 

Actually, yes, they do exist and are quite cheap. The old stype frame pump, the very old style was just a stick with a straight shape. At the business end there was a threaded hole in wich you fitted the little hose. It was a arround 6 inches (15 cm) long, and had the propper head for the valve in one end, and in the other ussually had the same thread as the Dunlop Valve. Here is the only picture I could find: These pumps had a receptacle in the handle end, where the hose could be stored. There was a spring inside the telecopic handle, such as to dampen the hit at the end of the stroke, this also alowed you to "compress" the pump a little. The bike frame had a couple of "spikes" pointing at each other alongside some tube of the frame. So to store it you slide the hose inside the handle and inserted the pump between the spikes mentioned before, the pressure from the spring kept the pump in place. That is what you see in the picture, the longest, most shiny tube that is not being held, ia a pump stored in the green bike frame. Those pump hoses are still available, and they look like this: 

Your best option is to practice a lot on how to unclip your foot, so you get accustomed to it. I suppose you have already done this. So you must now adjust the spring tension on your pedals. Refer to the instruction manual on how to adjust it. Aside from that, I have found that dirt, grime and other pollution in the cleats makes it extra hard to get the foot free. It gets to your pedals every time you step on mud or soft soil and then go back to he pedal, something that does not happen so frequently for a road biker. When you cleat after stepping on mud or soft soil your shoe picks up little stones, little stems, leaves and all sort of things that clog up the pedal's mechanism, and the pedaling action makes all this dirt get to critical places. That's why I recommend to thoroughly clean the pedals and oiling them between rides. Normally you won't get too much dirt in only one ride, but you don't want it to get accumulated, for this worsens the performance of the release mechanism. Oil helps a lot for clipping in and out, but also helps a little by not allowing some dirt to stick to the mechanism (Your pedal won't be so dirty by the end of the ride). Tip #2: you should periodically inspect your pedals and cleats for dents, deformations and other that can affect your ability to clip out. Specifically I've had trouble with the "ramps" that push the cleat out when you twist your foot. For some reason these develop a kind of hook that prevents the foot from twisting. You can easily file out these deformations, usually they are surprisingly tiny! Use a fine file or a rotary tool (dremel) with a fine grit grinding stone. Tip #3: Part of some training I also did, was about conquering difficult technical sections without removing any foot from its pedal. I did this by building small obstacles in the middle of an ample flat terrain. The Obstacles where made of stones and logs, trying to make then with increased difficulty every time, but always made then in such a way that if I fell it wouldn't hurt much, hence the flat clean terrain around the obstacle. This kind of training gives the rider a lot of self confidence and builds the necessary skills that make the use of cleated pedals more intuitive at the required level for MTB riding. These tips have kept me clipped for 10 years of mountain biking, doing XC, and a little all-mountain and downhill. My final comment: IF you're accustomed to SPD on your road bike, make an effort to stay on SPD for your mountain bike, if you remove them, almost sure you'll miss them! 

At this point the bike had a very weird feeling. I think I was a little bit faster, but it felt awkward and dorky so I never really enjoyed the ride. 

If the bike is a cheap one, then a really cheap seatpost must exist for it. Cheap Seatposts are usually made of steel or mild steel, which should withstand the wear from repeatedly adjusting the seat height, so my advise here is, don't worry that much. Some bikes use a type of seatpost that doesn't have an integrated seat clamp. If this is your case, it is likely that you can even fit a piece of common steel pipe to it, which will result really cheap if you obtain it from a scrapyard. Another suggestion is, instead of using the quick release clamp, you may like to make a few side to side perforations in the seatpost and using a pin to keep it from going down. This may make a quicker adjustment every time, you'll save just a few seconds. This sugestion is particularly suited if you can use plain pipe for a seatpost. Regarding lubricant: If it is really being changed/regulated daily, and the post slides really easily into the seat tube, there is no need for lubricant. If the seatpost slides easily, the friction is virtually non existent so there is no need to worry for it. Covering seatposts with grease is advised to prevent seizure of the post to the frame due to galvanic corrosion, but this only happens if the two pieces are left together long enough. So, again, if you are moving it daily and are concerned about fumes from the lube, you are probably fine without it.
