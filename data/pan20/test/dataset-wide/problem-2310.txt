No, center of gravity is not a issue between a tall and short person. That is because the rest of the body scales too. The center of gravity relative to the body height stays the same. Imagine a stool. If you make the legs longer but keep the same footprint, then it would be easier to topple. However, if you enlarged the footprint the same amount as the height, then it would not be easier to topple. It's not just the height of the center of gravity that matters, but that height relative to the footprint or base size. A taller person doesn't just have a higher center of gravity, but also a longer stride, and the ability to extend the feet farther out from the point directly below the center of mass. The two effects cancel. A taller person is not less stable than a shorter one. However, not all things scale linearly. All else being equal, smaller animals use more quiescent power than larger ones relative to their weight. For example, for a mouse it's no big deal to run up a wall. The mouse uses enough power just to stay alive that the additional power of running up a wall is not that much. For a typical human, though, the extra power of hiking up a steep hill is significant. Let's do the math of a example to see what the numbers look like. Let's say the human weighs 200 pounds, which is about 900 newtons. Typical power just sitting around at a comfortable temperature is about 50 W. As a sanity check on that, let's consider the often-quoted 2000 cal/day a human needs to eat to balance energy used. That's actually 2000 kcal in physics terms, which is 8.368 MJ. Over 24 hours, that comes out to 97 W. Considering that's a whole day average, about half that just sitting around seems plausible. So far we have 50 W quiescent power, and 100 W average daily power. Now let's look at what it takes to hike up a hill. Let's say that means going up a 15% grade at a 30 minute per mile pace, just to pick something. That means for every mile horizontally, the hiker went up 792 feet, which is 241 meters. Times the 900 N weight, that is 217 kJ in potential energy. Divided by the 30 minutes it took to expend that energy yields 121 W. Note that this is the actual output of the body. The body is not perfectly efficient in producing that 121 W. I don't know what the efficiency is, but that 121 W output must mean at least 150 W expenditure, probably more like 200 W. Of course the body still has to keep itself alive, so the total energy expenditure is 250 W. So, hiking up this example hill means the body is using up 5 times the power compared to resting. It should be no surprise that feels like a lot of work. The difference for a smaller animal is that the resting power per unit mass is higher. The physics of going up a hill is still the same, although the speed should also be scaled to the body size to be fair. Both these effects combine to make the difference between sitting around and going up hill much less. 

Bobcats have short stubby tails. The typical house cat has a tail almost the length of its body. Bobcats have a specific color pattern. House cats have all kinds of colors and patterns due to the human selection and lack of natural selection. 

It's definitely one of the cascade peaks, which are all old volcanoes. The question is which one. As others have pointed out Mt Baker is a possibility. Another might be Mt Hood. It's often not so easy to tell where you are in a commercial airline flight. You could have been further south than you think. Note that there seems to be nothing major to the left (south), but there does seem to be a hint of higher mountains at the horizon at the right (north) side of the picture. To answer this question best, make a list of the likely suspects (there aren't very many of them), then look at profiles of each one seen from the east southeast. 

In most parts of Alberta "winter" starts well before November and extends well past mid February. That's OK if your protagonists get into their mess in November and get rescued (or whatever) in mid February. It's not OK if you think that the conditions lighten up in February somehow so they get themselves out, which they couldn't do in January. 

Getting trail conditions is region-specific. For example, in New England the Appalachian Mountain Club provides a good deal of trail info. I'm pretty sure there is a web site about trail conditions, but for the White Mountains of New Hampshire you can get trail conditions info directly at the Pinkham Notch visitor center run by the AMC, the National Forest visitor center in Lincoln, and probably various places you can call including the several you could walk into to ask. Every major park or forest has some place you can call or look on the web. For more obscure places (hiking-wise), it gets less formal. Here in north-central Massachusetts, like in much of the US northeast away from the major hiking destinations, there is a surprisingly large scattering of land open to the public with trails on it. There is no one place to go for info about all of them. Most of these areas are just patches of land with maybe a sign and hopefully a few blazes on the trails. There is no visitor center or any building or any staff, so there is nobody you can call directly and there isn't likely a web site with up to date conditions. For the obscure local trails, you have to use a little common sense. For example, if you wanted to explore the Harry J Rich State Forest in Groton, which is unstaffed with no facilities, you use a little logic and realize it's conditions aren't going to be that different from a few miles away. For example, you might inquire about the Willard Brook State Park in Townsend. Conditions will be similar enough, and someone there may have even recently been out to the Rich Forest. Or find out about conditions in the town. Lots of towns have conservation groups with web sites. These don't generally list current conditions since that would be too much work for the volunteers to keep up with. But, there is usually some contact info. To use Groton as the example again, there is the Groton Conservation Commission, the Groton Trails committee, the private Groton Conservation Trust, each with web pages. It doesn't take much digging to find a email address or find that there is a grotontrails email list. Send a message saying you're from out of town and would like to know the conditions, and you'll probably have half a dozen replies by the end of the day. If you want to hike in Littleton or Ayer or Westford instead, dig around there for web sites and contact information. For example, Littleton has the Littleton Conservation Trust private group, and the headquarters for the New England Forestry Foundation are located there. If you can't find anything for Ayer, for example, look at a map and realize that whatever you find out about Littleton or Groton will be pretty close. These are just local examples that I am familiar with since I live and work here, but this sort of small local patchwork of organizations applies to most of New England, and probably to many other places too. So the answer for less known places is to dig around for local info and be willing to extrapolate to the place you are actually interested in. 

Unlike with most predators, running away works if you can get far enough fast enough. The bull chasing you can run faster than you, but the reason he's chasing you in the first place is only because he wants you out of his territory. By running away you show the bull that you're not a threat, not asserting dominance, and are also giving him the desired result. If you're lucky, after a short distance the bull will feel like he achieved his aim and stop persuing you. After all, you're not dinner to him, like you are to a predator. Once you're far enough away, you aren't worth expending energy on anymore. It helps to run towards the nearest fence that you can hop, or some other obstacle that the bull can't as easily cross as you can. Make sure not to run towards any of the other cattle. If no fence is nearby, head towards a rocky outcrop. Cattle can walk on rocks, but see little value in them. 

Bears have definitely been migrating from the Berkshires in western MA eastward over the last couple of decades or so. Everyplace roughly outside Route 128 (about 15 mile ring road around Boston) and parts of the south shore and The Cape has bears. Loss of habitat is pushing them to find food elsewhere. Increasingly, that elsewhere is near people, since that's pretty much all that's left. Bears are naturally afraid of humans, but with increased exposure, some become acclimated. In places with less wild food, bears are becoming increasingly used to being around humans. One town in the Connecticut Valley (North Hampton ?) had such a bear problem that it took a city-wide effort and new ordinances to deal with the problem. You can probably find details about that on line. Worcester may be headed the same way. Acclimated bears are a danger to humans, and are usually shot by animal control officers. The best thing you can do is make sure there is never any food left around, and to encourage your neighbors to do the same. Your bear was probably young and inexperienced, has previously found food near humans, and may have even been given handouts by irresponsible people. Once this behavior is learned, it is not unlearned. This bear will undoubtedly continue, and will most likely get itself killed this fall when it really steps up its eating behavior. The MA Division of Fish and Wildlife tracks these encounters and is quite aware of the situation. There is probably a lot of detail about urban bears on their web site.

Then I contacted our local vocational or "trades" high school. They had the appropriate equipment. I had a meeting with the guy in charge of such things, and he was quite willing to route signs for us for a nominal fee as long as he didn't have to store any material for us. It was near the end of the school year, which is a busy time for them, so he asked me to contact him again in 2 months. I did and left several messages and emails over a few months without ever getting a single reply. Eventually I gave up. A guy I knew with his own machine shop was willing to route signs for cheap on the side as long as I could just give him the program for his numerically controlled machine. I was going to generate the graphics with my slide making program anyway, which is based on vector fonts. I figured it wouldn't be that difficult to have it output control commands for the machine, and was willing to write the software. I took pictures of the control head of his machine to track down the manufacturer: 

I am trying to determine the best way to attach trail signs to trees in the woods. The problem with trees is that they grow. If you firmly embed a nail in the wood, the tree will eventually grow around the nail head. When we put up small plastic trail markers (what we use a blazes), we deliberately leave a ½ inch or so gap between the nail head and the marker. Put another way, we don't bang the nail in all the way. This gives the marker room to slide along the nail, instead of the growing tree pushing all around behind the nail head, and eventually buckling and cracking the plastic marker. I am now going to put up some aluminum signs that will last much longer than the plastic trail markers. A tree could grow multiple inches over the expected life of the sign. What I'd like is a way to mount the sign so that it stays on the outside, moving with the growth of the tree instead of getting swallowed up by it. It seems that just the right diameter and length of nail might do it. You want the sign to be held, but the nail be able so slide out as the tree grows and pushes against the sign. What diameter and depth might that be? What studies are there that have looked into this? What experience do you have with this? 

Five hours from San Francisco is enough to reach a good chunk of the Sierras and even further north in the area of Lassen and Shasta. There are large areas of national forest within this range. Generally the national forests will have less restrictions than national parks, particularly popular ones like Yosemite. Each national forest will have its own rules. Most will allow gathering small amounts of dead and down wood for a fire, but fires will be restricted by location, time of year, and may require a permit. Forest fires are a serious issue in this area. Check whether Yosemite allows dispersed camping. Probably not, but maybe in some of the more remote areas. Even if they do, whether you're allowed to have a open fire is a completely separate issue. Yosemite used to allow gathering dead and down wood within some distance of certain roads for use in fires in designated camping spots. That was a long time ago, so the policy may well have changed. 

Unfortunately, much of the shoreline of Mt Desert Island looks like that, particularly on the east and south. Stop and think about what you were doing before and after being there. There is only one way onto the island by car. Did you see this before or after getting to Bar Harbor? How long before or after? Do you remember which way the shore was facing? Could you see anything across the water, or was it open ocean? In what directions from straight out did you see other land across the water? What time of day was it? From that you can find the sun angle, from which you may be able to determine orientation some of the pictures were taken in. Did you just pull over at the side of the road, or was there a parking area just for that purpose? Were there any signs there? Was this at high tide or low tide? Basically, what I'm trying to point out is that you know a lot more than just what the pictures show, even if maybe you don't realize it. Think about it carefully. There are substantial clues in your head. After narrowing it down, look at maps and Google Earth to see what matches. At the least, you should be able to dismiss large sections of the coast as not matching. Keep narrowing things down. For example, if you were near Bar Harbor, you should be able to eliminate anyplace on the western half of the island. The pictures also show no buildings obvious along the shoreline. That clearly eliminates anyplace at a town, for example. Keep following the clues. You know a lot more than you're telling us. 

We are very pleased with the quality. We initially did a test of three signs, each 6x12 inches. One had 4 lines of text, one 5 lines of text, and the third was a resolution test. I wanted to know what I could rely on their process doing, keeping in mind that some day I may want to make a large sign with a map or other graphics on it, and I wanted to know what size line/space their process could reproduce. After deploying both the text signs at real intersections in the woods, we decided that the 5 line format was plenty readable from a reasonable distance. This is what we are going forwards with now. The sign above is from the second batch of 9 signs. We tweaked the arrows to make them a little fatter than the first batch, and added our URL to the bottom. For the resolution test sign, I made 7 patterns with line/space widths from 25 mil to 100 mil. I chose 25 mil as the smallest because I was expecting their process to be unable to reproduce that, and it's finer than we needed anyway. To my surprise, even the 25 mil (0.64 mm) line/space details were cleanly reproduced, better than you can see in the resolution picture allowed on this web site: 

I don't know about poison oak, but have lots of experience with posion ivy. I think the irritant in both is similar (urushiol oil, or something like that). This answer applies to poison ivy, which I think transfer to posion oak too. No, ordinary soap does no good against this oil. I have taken a shower with ordinary soap shortly after being exposed to poison ivy, and got the nasty rash. Last year I started using a product called TechNu (or something similar to that, can't remember exact name) and I can tell you it does work. It is something you use like soap after exposure, but unlike soap, it actually does wash off the irritating oil. There have been a least two cases now where I'm quite sure I got exposed to poison ivy while doing trail work. I went home afterwards, took a shower and washed with the TechNu stuff, and had no symptoms. I'm quite allergic to poison ivy, and am convinced that washing with this stuff made a difference. I'm at work now and the bottle is at home, but I sortof remember that poison oak is listed on the label as one of the irritants it is effective against.
