Politics and management is your answer. People from the wrong political party will get ostracized. They and their families cannot return to the town because they voted for the wrong ruler, or they took the wrong side in some political battle. They need to take their families and leave or else face punishment. Since your technology is so old, the life of those who work for a living will be really tough. The demands of the rich will increase as the rich have a way of getting bored and demanding more lavish life styles than they already have. Many of the working/slave class will eventually feel so burdened that they'll take their families and escape the city which for them is nothing but a labor camp. If anything, it will get really hard to keep poor people in the city, so slavery will be invented, or upgraded if it hasn't been invented yet. There will always be insane people or criminals and the city folks would want to get rid of them. The simplest way would be to kick them out of the city, if they aren't useful as workers. 

I don't know why nobody mentioned satellites and space debris. A piece of something that is manufactured could stay in the orbit for a long time. But, if it's too small, you need to correct the orbit. There is some discussion on SE about making satellites stay in orbit for a long time, see here the discussion on orbit correction, and here the one on making long lasting satellites. A civilization could build something on an asteroid already orbiting the Earth and leave it there for the next civilization to discover. That will be big enough not to need orbit corrections, and if you coat part of the asteroid with glass or aluminum, it would be visible from Earth. That mysterious space object will always be a puzzle for the generation to come. Also, if you are advanced enough, build pyramids on the Moon and put metal plates on them, so they shine. They won't be discovered easily, but they will last millions of years. Or you could go all out and sculpt the Moon like in Greg Bear's book Eon. 

Would roasted pig work? I would cut the belly, take out everything, put vegetables like onions, carrots, and whatever else inside. Then I would sew the belly back and leave it in the shadow of my space station until the thermometer indicates that the exterior (a few inch of fat) is frozen (meaning it insulates the inside of the pig. I would take the pig out of the shadow and leave the cut in the sun until its fried well. This operation will keep the interior insulated so it doesn't lose too much water and ruin my vegetables inside. The rest is just routine roasting in the sun and it will last for a few good hours. At the end of the roasting, the pig fat will be too charred and dehydrated to be edible, but the rest should be fine. The whole thing should take about 4 hours. 

As others have suggested, there is a problem with the stone humanoids. They are too powerful, and they seem to have no needs. This suggests they are probably not very social, which means they tend to be found alone. Even if they are powerful and fast, they'd still be vulnerable to attacks by large groups of people. Also, because of their power, they don't need to be so smart. If that's the case, they are essentially trolls. Trolls who don't need to eat, would just lie around all day waiting for the sun to disappear. Another option is that the stone people, being as intelligent and invulnerable, have no need for further conquest. Therefore, they dedicate their lives to philosophical pursuits and crafts. Early when people settled on the continent, they made clear that humans can do whatever they wanted except for attacking stone people and polluting their sacred grounds. The punishment for those would be wiping out, Ghenghis Khan style, all the offending villages. 

Someone thought of a skyscraper hanging from a geostationary asteroid. It is not possible with the current technology. I'll link the SE question about it. You could use this kind of space object to transport back to Earth in controlled conditions whatever you like. If it is solar energy, you could use optic fiber to transport it from the asteroid to the surface, or you could even send a high energy laser beam through some vacuum tube until it reaches the ground. Other materials like Uranium that you mine from the asteroids could be sent down by an elevator. The building could be made using some high tensile materials and you could argue that graphene or carbon nanotube advances have made possible producing meter-long defect free structures of these materials. 

Something like Roman Empire should develop along the coast, just like that empire did. Too far inland, you should need a way to make the transportation cheaper or faster. Then you need to improve the communication, as it was already mentioned. Once your empire riches its maximum size, it has to become self-sufficient. That's the real difficulty. Rome was a very large city and coudn't support itself. Every now and then they would mount expeditions to rob their neighbors. When their neighbors became part of the empire, they would overtax them. Eventually, the empire overextended, there was a lot of Rome to feed and it was very hard to collect from the faraway provinces. Things got sour, then dark. So, I propose the following: 

I think the short answer is that Romans win. The short bows don't have the penetrating power to pierce the Roman shield. When tercio sends a volley, Romans put the shields up, so the formation looks like a turtle. Romans can approach in this formation with minimal losses. When Romans get close, it's a few lines of pikemen against theirs. Pikes would typically slide off the shields, and pikemen will try to impale the Romans before getting to close. It could keep romans at bay, depending on how many rows of pikes are, but, in the end, pikes get stuck and Romans still have the short sword. I assume they threw their javelin at pikemen already. If tercio fights in phalanx formation, with archers behind, Romans can flank tercio. That ends badly for tercio, with pikemen killed and archers fleeing. But, if the bows can penetrate the Roman shield, the fight is similar to that between Persians and Romans. Persians have a good chance to win. 

On a planet with 9 year days, it might be a serious problem for intelligent life to develop. If during that long day, the temperatures stay in the range people can tolerate, it would probably mean that in the dark regions it's really cold. I think the region where people should live would be very narrow. Also, there would be little plant life as we know it on earth since no tree would resist freezing below -100C. I assume most land plants would be ferns and mushrooms who can produce frost resistant spores. The land animals would be small and would also take part in the great migration, like every mobile being on the planet. The weather would be reasonably stable, and it would be mostly cloudy all the time, assuming you have enough water. Close to the interface regions between light and dark, you would have strong storms that would be a great motivator for someone not to fall too far behind with the migration. Humans don't really belong to this environment, but if they existed, they would be faster and smaller than homo sapiens. They'd also have a lot of endurance. Maybe they'd weight about thirty to fifty kilograms, not more, because of the food scarcity. Other animals that could coexist with them would be birds, goats, or dogs. There could be also some sort of Sarlacc-like beings. Sarlacc would burrow into the ground, in the path of migration and wait for its prey. What would fall into its pit would be consumed over the nine-year night. After years of migration, people will learn the pattern and the ones getting old and falling behind would start building settlements to be found by the next wave of migration. Enough generations would be able to learn how to build strong enough buildings to resist the cold and the storms at the interface. They could capture (tame) Sarlaccs and use them to preserve food for the settlements. Once they start settling, people could grow slower and stronger to be able to keep up with the building. The settlements would look a lot like ant hills. This would especially be feasible if the planet has thermal waters. For the migratory people, not having to sleep would be quite useful, as they would have to always be on guard for various dangers. Dolphin brains would help, and if they had those brains, the people would look more like the Ferengi in Star Trek. They would also have big ears, like elves. The eyes need to be like ours, only they don't need as good irises. They aren't adapted for night. They also have to be dark skinned to get more sunlight protection and they have to be able to sweat. Their kidneys have to work great to be able to drink whatever water they run into. I would also put a hump on their backs to store additional fat and water. 

Incredible speed isn't so incredible if it's not fast enough to modify the mass of your planet. As others have pointed out, if your planet rotates fast enough, it might get pulled apart by centrifugal forces. But, if God made your planet, he surely must have thought of this. So, let it spin so fast, that it's equator moves close to the speed of light. Not only will your planet be seen by observers as a massive celestial body, but if its mass and speed were large enough, it could radiate detectable gravitational waves (I think). I'm not a specialist in General Relativity, but to estimate the mass of the rotating planet, I'd solve this integral: $m=m_0\int_o^R\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\omega^2r^2/c^2}}4\pi r^2dr$, where $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the planet, $m_0$ is its rest mass, $R$ its radius and $c$ is the speed of light. Edit: for the low velocity case in which the objects at the equator experience half of the acceleration compared to the ones at the poles: $a=g-\omega^2R=g/2 $, meaning $\omega=\sqrt{\frac{Gm}{2R^3}}$, with $G$ the gravitational constant. There always will be a centrifugal acceleration $g\cos \theta/2$ perpendicular to the axis of the planet. $\theta$ is the latitude. The Coriolis acceleration would be $-2\omega \times \bf v$. Plugging in some numbers, for an Earth like planet, you would see a rotation period a little under 2 hours. The Coriolis forces should be one order of magnitude larger on your planet. 

Mercury surface is very hot (430C). Additionally, the Sun radiation as you approach Mercury with your mining mission could cook your ship's electronics and personnel. So, you need to find a way to approach Mercury. The best way is to approach Mercury at such an angle, as to be in its shadow most of the time. Unfortunately, Mercury is small, so I think you could only benefit from its shadow for the last few million of km (I didn't calculate how many) of your approach. This brings me to the first issue. You need to make sure your ship electronics is resistant to heat. That leaves out a lot of nifty discoveries in microelectronics that make possible today's computing. Your ship electronics have to be simple and extremely robust. Mariner 10 mission approached Mercury, so that much is possible. But, you cannot bring people to Mercury, unless you develop a cooling system and radiation shielding to protect your ship. If you don't, you have to develop materials and new electronics that enable high density information processing and storage at up to 500C, at least. Then, you have to develop the AI for your ship and robots that would enable you to complete the mission and handle unpredictable situations. I'm not sure if that is doable now, but machine learning has made lots of progress and it is conceivable. Once you get to Mercury, better land on the dark side (Mercury is tidally locked). You need to build your basis, and bring enough material to be able to start the mining operation. Your space ships can only bring enough material if they have nuclear reactors. If you don't have the technology, better hope you have all that you need to build on the planet. In that case, you need to do a lot of exploration and that might prolong forever your mission. To dig at 200 miles, I think is only possible with atomic blasts. Assume your hole is similar to those for diamond mining, you should dig an area of at least 100m radius, to have a chance to get to the bounty. That's about 1 billion cubic meters of material, assuming your hole has vertical walls. But, if you dislodge the dirt with atomic blasts, it will most likely be an inverted cone. In that case, assuming a 15 degrees for the cone's angle, which I think is conservative, but possible, the material you need to extract is in the range of ten thousand billion cubic meters. The other thing is that Mercury is quite dense ($5.4g/cm^3$) so you need to break the rock somehow. You can also do mining on the hot side of the planet. You can use solar concentrators to melt and then solidify the walls of your hole to stabilize them after you extracted the rock. Looking at the numbers, I think the biggest challenge is getting the rock out. For that, you cannot bring enough equipment from Earth, because Earth has a limited supply of metals. I think you should find enough metal on Mercury, but you should develop an planet-wide chemical industry to separate it and make more machines. That is likely to take lifetimes to finish. One way to do it, would be to make your machines self-replicating.
