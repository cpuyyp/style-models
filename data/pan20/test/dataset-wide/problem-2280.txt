What you want is called "skin". However, that's not something you just add on one day and go hiking for days. Keep in mind that our species evolved to get around by walking and running with our feet. Our feet have evolved to handle that. Unfortunately, habitually wearing shoes eliminates the stimuli that the feet need to produce the necessary thick skin in the right places. The solution, if the desire is to be able to hike reasonable distances barefoot, is therefore to stop wearing shoes. Unfortunately, our feet can't respond to the new stimulus instantly. I like walking around barefoot, and do so whenever possible in the summer. I find it takes a month or so of significant regular walking over rough ground to build up the thick skin so that you don't care anymore. If you only do this occasionally, it will take longer, perhaps never even get to the full thick skin level. So how do you get to the point where you can walk most anywhere barefoot comfortably without at some point pushing the limits of comfort? You don't. Your feet need the feedback that you consider uncomfortable to trigger them to build up the thick skin that makes it comfortable. Once you do though, you'll be surprised how much rough stuff you can walk over without giving it much thought. About the only thing I've never really gotten comfortable on is a bed of artifically crushed rock. Once you regularly walk around outside barefoot, you'll probably be amazed at how much more you are aware of details in the ground. Different ground is at different temperatures, which makes sense but is generally not something you realize when wearing shoes. You also find that your toes start doing some useful things, not just stay lumped together with the rest of your foot inside a shoe. You will feel a lot more shure-footed too. I don't know how exactly to explain it, but you can feel that you will loose traction with bare feet before you actually do in a way that just doesn't match up to any sensation with wearing shoes. Shoes just suddenly slip. With bare feet, you can sense you are getting close before you slip. I like walking around barefoot and make of point of doing so whenever the temperature allows it. Here in New England, that is roughly half the year. Unfortunately the feet loose the thick skin during the winter so you mostly have to start all over again every spring. I don't have a good answer for that. I think it is unfortunate that our urbanized society usually looks down on walking around barefoot. This is to the point that many private establishments actually require you to wear shoes to enter them. Contrary to common belief, there is actually no law that says shoes are required in supermarkets. These are private property, so the owners have the right to set the rules, but it's wrong of them to claim state law makes them require shoes. In the summer I keep a pair of sandals or "flip-flops" in the car so I can put them on when walking into a store I frequent. If I'm in a distant place where I'm not coming back any time soon, I sometimes have fun seeing what I can get away with. I get thrown out of the supermarket in Lincoln NH about once a year. It's interesting to note this has always been after I bought whatever I came in there for. Usually a manager comes over and tells me I need to wear shoes in the store as I'm paying in the checkout line or even after I've paid and am already walking out. I recognize they have the right to make the rules on their private property and I never resist when asked to leave, but that doesn't mean I can't have a little fun tweaking their nose every once in a while. 

Unfortunately your picture doesn't give a good sense of scale, but my first reaction was that it looked like dog poop. Some other canid is also possible, with coyote being the most probable, then fox. As for safety concert, you don't need to examine poop for that. There is nothing in southern NH that is a physical threat to humans, at least assuming a normal healthy animal. Black bears can hurt you if they want to, but they don't want to, unless you do something deliberately stupid. The most dangerous animal in NH is a human. Second on the list is a moose. But again, other than humans, nothing is going to bother you unless you do something stupid. I hike around a lot in nothern MA and sometimes in the White Mountains of NH, and I have never come accross any animal that presented a danger. We have coyotes living in the woods around our house in northern MA, but they present no danger. They run away as soon as they see us. Actually we see them only occasionally, but we hear them howling every night in response to nearby train whistles. 

I'd say yes, it would add roughly the same temperature boost to all bags. This is of course assuming other conditions are the same, like the surface you are on, stillness of the air, etc. Short of the material actually changing physically (like down getting more fluffy), one piece of insulating material will have the same temperture drop accross it for the same heat power going thru it, regardless of the absolute temperature. Put another way, if something exhibits a 10° drop when you put 50 watts thru it, it will exhibit that same 10° drop whether that is from 10 to 20 degrees or 50 to 60 degrees. Again, this is assuming the material is not changed by the temperature difference, like it melts, clumps, gets more fluffy, etc. Of course things will vary, but as a first rough approximation I'd say the degrees added "warmth" will be about the same accross different bags inside. 

I am not a doctor, so I can only repeat what I think I understood from lectures by those that do have medical training. I'm pretty sure I remember Dr Murray Hamlett (I highly recommend attending one of his lectures, if he's still doing them. He is not only a leader and pioneer in cold weather medicine, but also a very good and engaging speaker.) saying to keep the patient awake. I don't remember exactly the reasons he might have given, but keeping the internal metablic activity as high as possible sounds like a advantage to me. Basically, we burn fewer calories, and therefore produce less heat, when asleep. It is also more difficult to assess a patient's state when they aren't fully concious.
