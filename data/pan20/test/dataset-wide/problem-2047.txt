Features: Motivation Working on your own projects, bits that you really want fixed/refactored from your daily work or similar things at your own pace and direction is very rewarding to a lot of programmers. Getting out of the box It sparks creativity, thinking through a whole stack, planning and coordinating with other team members and possibly presentation skills. Extending/Spreading knowledge Often people worked together on projects to learn from or with each other new skills, technologies or libraries. Improvements to company products or assets Almost everything I've ever seen done in this kind of environment eventually proved useful to the company. 

I'm currently sitting on the other side of the table, building up a team. Maybe it's not the norm but for me, if you 'talk the talk' as they say, I can get a feeling for whether candidates are good on the job and ultimately I'll form my picture working with a candidate on a trial day, or pair programming session. So, if you genuinely are good at a job, display it not by preening yourself on something but by having an honest conversation, being interested in what problems you would be facing and - if you can - Current producer supplier, on how you would approach those difficulties, regardless of whether you would be hired. Would work with me, at least. 

The solutions to this problem depend on who this old lady is. Is she a worker that produces something - Manager, Developer, Designer, etc? Is she support - secretary, admin, assitant, reception? Is she a mover and a shaker? (Note - this might be someone from either category above.) Not all that long ago a company I was working for was trying to migrate from Office 2007 to Office 2010. There was a secretary who used 2003 because she refused to learn any changes in software. This was in 2012 - she was using Windows XP and Office 2003 when the entire rest of the department had been migrated. She was the secretary to a VIP in the company and, as such, a pretty big mover and shaker. We finally migrated that computer when she retired. This is an example of a person who you may not be able to migrate. Understandably your situation is a bit different - you're shutting down your exchange servers and migrating. But if she is in with an important enough person or she herself is an important enough person then you need to come at things from a different angle. We had a couple other folks, at the same time, who had tried to put off migration. This is the cynic in me but a lot of them were complaining so that they could have an 'excuse' for any issues. Oh they forgot to do something? It's that goshdarned new computer system! The solution for us, for everyone except the one secretary, was to get buy ins from their bosses. It's one thing to complain about something that IT is 'forcing' everyone to do. It's another thing to complain about something your direct boss is excited or happy about. That, ultimately, ended up being our problem with our lone holdout. She got to her boss and poisoned the well before we did. Even the oldest, crotchety-est ladies on staff somehow ended up being fine with the changes when it stopped being "the mean IT people are doing this" and became "This is part of your job, if you are incapable..." That is, admittedly, pretty cynical and a tiny bit mean. It wasn't all stick and no carrot - one on one training with users having problems. Promises(that you intend to keep) that when they have a problem with the system you will be there for them and help them resolve it. That if it's a legitimate problem or change you will go to bat for them. You will stand up and say "Yes Sr BossPerson, Gladys was unable to turn in the TPS reports as you expected and it was because of our system and this is how we've resolved this..." At the end of the day most people jut want to do their jobs. A lot of people also like complaining. The key to the second problem is to acknowledge the first. 

This is equal to "I found out that I'm not able to do this" or "I'm not able to do this" if it's something discussed before. Again, it has nothing to do with being disabled in particular. Everybody can find out that they're not able to do something - even after they've been assigned the task. The professional way of dealing with these issues towards a disabled person is to be aware that these issues are relevant regardless of disabilities and deal with them as one would towards a not-disabled person. What ever that means for the particular company and it's culture. Addendum: So how to address topics like this with team members? The most imporant thing is to praise in public and criticize in private. 

Applying for job is sort of like sales with yourself as the product, so you can apply this here. What does this mean? I'll take your example: 

This very much depends on where you are. Here in Germany, there's a lot of extra cost associated with contracting/freelancing, even beyond simple health care. When employed, insurance against unemployment and some sort of penion insurance are covered too, both of which can be argued about but they make accepting a lower but steady income not unreasonable. Also, again in Germany, there's the common conception that being employed instead of contracting binds you to a company for a longer term, which ideally would be in their best interest. A 'rebuttal' simply could be, that you prefer contracting and doing your insurances and taxes. 

The interviewer was probably taken aback because instead of considering the context of the question("we are here, together, to see if you are a good fit for the job and questions asked here are to determine that") you went for the general answer. Questions like this aren't because the interviewer wants you to do his or her job(which is a fairly ridiculous assertion) or because they are lazy or bad at interviewing. Questions like these are prompts for your 'elevator' speech that should show two things: a) You've done some research about the job and can articulate how you and this position would fit into the bigger picture. b) A chance for you to show off a little and explain why exactly you think you are awesome or skilled. In less formal companies an interviewer might ask - "What makes you awesome?" or "What is something that you've done that is exciting or impressive?" One of my favorite questions to ask is "What is the coolest/most interesting thing on your resume, the thing that makes you go 'Why hasn't she asked me about this yet?!?'" Interviewers ask questions like these in order to give you an opportunity to shine, to really show your passion(and knowledge) about projects you've worked on. It's possible that, your initial caveat aside, your answer showed this knowledge and passion. It's possible that even with a weak answer to this question your interview and credentials were otherwise very strong. It's possible that you were the only applicant. It's possible that the interviewer dislikes the question nearly as much as some of the other answerers here on The Workplace... There are a lot of reasons that a person is chosen for a position and it would be hard to pin much on this particular answer. Personally I think you would benefit from not adding the caveat. If you don't think you're a great fit for a job why would you be applying for it? Sure Batman could swing in and be like "I'm Batman" and he would probably be amazing at the job BUT you don't know(as you mentioned) and there's almost no benefit to downplaying your strengths and awesomeness in answering that question. 

Step 3 demands your creativity. Think outside the box, don't go looking for "That One Job" that you want to do in the long run, but see how the things you like about that perspective can be fused with the job experience you already have. These jobs are out there and with an open mind, unblinkered, you will find it. And sooner than you expect. 

You want to have lunch with you colleague? Invite them. You want to be happy in the workplace? Make others in the workplace happy. You want to be included by others? Include them yourself. I would say "Do to others as you would have them do to you", if it wouldn't sound like preaching. How does this work? or: I want them to change, not myself! / This isn't about me but the other person. / But this is too simple, how can this work? Doing this exploits a neat little mechanism in the human mind. People call it the principle of reciprocity. Basically, somebody gives you something first, then asks something from you, you have a much harder time, saying no. Sales people love this. Here however you use it for something more benign. You give them something, say, attention or happiness, by inviting them to have lunch or what you may think of. Next time they think about who to invite (read: their brain asks them to invite you), they will include you, too. 

Here is a question that you've not answered: Does the change you are proposing fix a typo that could potentially cause confusion down the road? You've mentioned that you point out "typos to do with internal acronyms and terms". And in some cases I can see the importance of correcting a typo. If there are two internal acronyms, ABC and ACB and someone in the meeting uses the wrong one then potentially(if there is no context perhaps) this could lead to confusion. But honestly? This part of my answer will be split into two parts. The first involves meeting notes that are meant to be post processed and distributed or involving communication outside your team and work. The second involves internal, 'meeting minutes'. Let's go with the first. If a group in a meeting is working together on a document that will be released externally than everyone in the room should be on point in catching and alleviating typos and poor communication. These materials are unique because, ultimately, they will represent the organization to the outside world. There is a responsibility, in this case, to speak up about any ambiguity or mistakes. In this case you, and everyone else in the room, is absolutely in the right to correct, gently if possible, any mistakes. The second? Well the second situation is where you kind of come off looking like a jerk. Internal, informal meeting minutes for casual meetings are just that: informal, internal and casual. Things that do not accurately represent the meeting should be called out. Say if the meeting agreed to do XYZ and the meeting minutes say "By consensus the group has agreed NOT to do XYZ" Otherwise? You're showing off whether you realize it or not. Whether it is your intention or not you are attempting to show how much more you know/notice/etc than the person taking the notes. If it bothers you that much? Take the notes yourself. Is anyone else in the room suggesting fixes for typos? Really think back over the last few meetings - how many times has everyone in the room spoken up? Of that, for each person, roughly what percentage was to correct typos in the meeting minutes? This is how you can guage how your regular 'corrections' are being taken. There is an important lesson all developers and IT have to learn eventually and that is the lesson of 'Good enough'. You are, absolutely, putting your working relationship with other people in the room at risk every time you recommend a 'correction' and for what gain? Do these notes live on forever, being referenced back constantly? Or are they like most meeting minutes where they get dumped on a network drive, emailed out or on a sharepoint in order to show that, yes, things happened in the meeting? What is the real benefit, other than scratching your typo itch, that these corrections provide? Imagine, for a moment, if you were working in a room and every time you made a minor, unimportant, mistake a specific person called you out. You open the cmd instead of the server console or something minor, unimportant, otherwise unnoticeable and, immediately, this other person calls you out. "You're doing that wrong!" How would you feel about that person? Especially, perhaps, if there were others in the group who did not point those things out? Some folks who read this may be adamant that they would be thrilled to have their mistakes pointed out but, let's be honest here - no one likes to be called out. No one likes to be called out on minor, unimportant things. No one likes to be put on the spot(typing in front of a group) and called out on minor, unimportant things on notes that may never be seen again. You have a couple of possible solutions here. First - if the typos bother you so badly why haven't you volunteered to take the notes? Be polite, even joking: "I'm super particular about typos, do you mind if I take the notes?" You may be unaware of the challenge of actively participating in a meeting while taking public notes. Or, alternatively, suggest spreading it around. Let everyone take the notes. If, for whatever reason, that isn't a possibility take a break on commenting on typos and watch other's reactions to those typos. See if other's feel they are important enough to comment, see how they do so, get a sense of the culture of correcting others in your group. 

Can a company call on ethics to forbid you from participating in this case? I think not. They can forbid you from drawing on outside resources of course. Or shun everything community-backed altogether. But only picking out active contribution is, in my opinion, hypocritical at best, unethical in itself on closer examination. In my opinion, so as long as your company gains something from drawing on stackexchange, in some form or another, it's your company's duty, ethically speaking, to allow, even encourage you to participate, too. Disclaimer: because this keeps coming up I do not suggest disobeying a company's rules and guidelines. I'm only voicing my opinion on them. 

I don't consider interviews as tests that can be passed or failed, but at opportunities to gauge whether the interviewee would fit the position I'm seeking filled. If they went through the trouble of researching what I might ask and prepared the answers on a sheet of paper, I might actually consider that a good thing, because it could show their determination to learn what it takes to get the job, and, by extension, maybe also do it well. What bad might come from this: probably only wasted time on either side. You pass the interviewee on to somebody with domain knowledge to find out whether their skills are adequate for the open position and they might figure out the interviewee is not. But unless you know the domain of the interviewee, you can't do much more than follow a script of questions about it. So failing to see that their answers might be scripted (unless you heard them before, verbatim), shouldn't reflect badly on you. 

I would ask. This doesn't have to be confrontational. This doesn't have to be a big deal. This just needs to be a laid back conversations that occurs when you're having your regular one-on-ones with your supervisor. (You are having those right? If not I would recommend starting.) During that conversation just bring it up casually. "Hey, I noticed that was moved into a cubical and I'm out on a bench. Was there a specific reason for that?" I totally understand the focus that turns this into a gender issue. Women, perhaps especially in tech jobs, are often discriminated(even unintentionally) in ways that are very subtle. It can be as simple as expecting the woman on the team to make everyone else cupcakes on their birthday(or expecting a woman on the team to take meeting minutes). That's not a big, bad discrimination but it stings. But, if I were you, I would be more miffed that two employees that started on the same day(fairly recently) were being treated differently. At least unless there are other subtle differences in how you are treated.
