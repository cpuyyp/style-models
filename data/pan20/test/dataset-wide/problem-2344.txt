From your question, it sounds like you already have a plan to supply your body with calories. I'll further assume you will have protein and fat, not just carbohydrates. With those covered, you then need vitamins and minerals. Fiber is a good idea, too. It is possible to be healthy eating only wild animal foods (hunting / trapping) for quite some time, but you have to do it right. Eat the fat and the organs, as they are nutrient rich. (Lions eat only the organs, and leave the muscle to scavengers!) Liver is rich in Vitamin A, which is great but must be balanced with Vitamin D. Very lean meats such as rabbit will leave you nutrient-deficient (if that's all you eat), so you'll still need to fill in the gaps another way. If you learn a few edible wild plants for your area, you can round out your nutritional needs very nicely. I believe that wild plants tend to have much higher mineral and vitamin content than farmed plants. Here in Pacific Northwest, I would focus on: Miner's lettuce, so named because miners would eat it for this very reason. It's very tasty. Stinging Nettle is very nutritious. I eat it raw, but most people will steam or boil it to avoid the stingers. The stems are good for cordage - maybe a bracelet to remember your trip. Dandelion is nutritious and easy to find in many places. I love the yellow flowers, but dislike the stems immensely. Leaves are good, especially when new. Don't confuse it with catsear aka false dandelion. These plants are easy to find & eat, and give you fresh leafy greens that you can't pack with you. To learn more, you can take a wild edibles class and get an edible wild plants book for your region. 

As far as I can tell dog life jackets do not have different ratings as for human life jackets. All the models I have seen in a brief search seem designed for the situation where your dog is conscious, can keep themselves afloat, relatively to land and therefore assistance if needed. Additionally, I suspect due to dog life jackets being a relatively niche product no standards will have been made and standards from human life jackets won't easily carry over. It seems the main concern of manufacturers is the size of the dog. As dogs come in a wide variety of shapes and weights this seems reasonable and just as for humans a poorly fit life jacket could cause lots of problems for dogs. 

There are a large range nice routes you could do. Generally, I would say the further North you go the wilder/more remote it will be. Although if you go really far North, the options for Munros does decrease somewhat. For specific routes, the "official" Scottish coast to coast goes from Oban to St. Andrews, and has some options for remote bits and Munros going through the Trossachs. I haven't looked at it in detail but you could definitely do quite a nice route from Fort William to Aberdeen, taking in Ben Nevis, Glen Coe and the Cairgorms. This probably has the best options for Munros. You could also do a nice route to Inverness, either starting at Fort William and up the Great Glen. Or Start by doing Skye. You could even go from Ullapool to Inverness, which would be remote but doesn't have that many Munros. Unless, you particularly want to go coast to coast, there are many other nice long distance walks in Scotland. Lots of which are fairly remote or can easily be made so. 

¹ I'd probably have flown to the lake soon enough, I did consider crossing by swimming through the lake across the river, but didn't have the right gear. 

In the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, national parks are in IUCN Category V rather than II. That means, their level of protection is not equivalent to what is a national park in (most) other countries, but rather a "Protected Landscape/Seascape". Indeed, UK national parks have villages, farming, logging, and even mining, and one of the aims of Scottish national parks is to foster economic well-being of the inhabitants. Down south, the South Downs are bucolic enough with its farmland, villages and small roads, but it's not Big Bend, Sarek, or Hoge Kempen. Are there any natural areas in the United Kingdom with a protection similar to the internationally recognised protection for national parks? That is, are there protected areas with no mining or logging allowed, and at best very limited farming and human habitation? If not, are there at least areas with a protection level stricter than what UK National Parks have? 

Start with a clean mouth Take a small bite Chew it in the very front of your mouth Spit it out Notice how it tastes, and how you feel. Not just in your mouth & throat, but throughout your body. Dizzy? Fuzzy vision? Weak? 

There are many different plant species, but you can say a lot about entire families, or at least about genera. A great resource for this information is Tom Elpel's Botany in a Day. Learn to recognize the most severe poisonous plans (here in WA state, USA, it's poison hemlock) and don't bother tasting them. It's probably a good idea to skip the whole carrot family. Learn to recognize a few good edibles. I like dandelion, miner's lettuce, chickweed, peppergrass, stinging nettle, and mustards. 

You always learn how to do things better by doing them. But take baby steps: Start by spending a night in your back yard. See if you can do dinner, sleep, breakfast without going back in the house. Take note of what things you use and what things you don't. There are campgrounds you can drive to. So drive to one & spend the night. If things don't go well, you can always hop in the car & drive home. Find a friend that likes to go camping, and ask to go with them. 

I'd climb the fence at a post. First, place /throw you backpack over the fence as climbing with it on is significantly more difficult, especially if heavy. Climb the fence, with at least one hand on the fence post and your feet one the wires, in between the barbs, as close to the post as reasonable. Being close to the fencepost minimizes the chance of you breaking the fence and is more stable. With your other hand either hold the wire, being careful not to grab a barb, or put both hands on the fencepost. When you are sufficiently high swing one leg over being careful not to catch yourself on the top barbs and place your foot in the fence on the other side. Either twist your foot around or put your heel in on the wire if you are less flexible. Carefully get your other leg over and climb or jump down. This method is easiest for lowish fences where you can just take one step on the fence and get your leg over. I wouldn't do it for anything over about 4 1/2 ft as the top of the fence may get quite unstable when you put your weight on it at that height. The disadvantages of this approach is that it is quite easy to catch your leg/crotch on the top wire and rip your trousers as you don't want to climb higher than necessary (climbing higher is less stable). Also if you feel you are losing balance don't grab the barbed wire, jump off. It may sound obvious but your natural reaction is to steady yourself and the wire is generally the most obvious thing to grab. 

Species in the forest will vary by locale. Here in the Pacific Northwest, Thimbleberry aka Salmonberry leaves are thick and soft, so they make a good wiping implement. The subtly-named How to Shit in the Woods is a good primer on this topic. One option described there is to use urine. Basically, you hold back the urine until you're done with the bowel movement, then use the pee to wash up. To clean your hands afterwards, cedar can help. Take a bite of cedar scales (leaves) straight from a tree. Chew it up & mix with saliva. Spit it out on to your hands and rub all over. 

Every ski resort gives lessons, and that's how you should begin. You can rent skis, and they will help you get them on, etc. Dress in clothes you would wear to go sledding. Remember that you work hard, get wet, then sit still. Layers, of wool and acrylic will keep you warm when wet and let you adjust as needed. Cotton makes you cold when wet, so avoid that, especially on you innermost layer. If you have a waterproof outer layer, that helps. Cover as much skin as possible: hat, gloves. Ski goggles are good but you can buy one after the first class if you like skiing. Having strong legs helps. 

Suppose I've been out for a long time already, and this system was too far away when I left. And suppose I'm here: 

The Subway, Zion National Park Within Zion National Park, for most of the year, day-use permits are required for The Subway and Mystery Canyon. They are awarded by advance lottery, or by last-minute drawing 7–2 days in advance. The lottery is not required during the low season (roughly November through March). This applies either for the full canyoneering route, or for non-technical hiking up to the point where canyoneering skills and equipment are required. 

View to Torre, the highest parts of the Serra de Estrela, where people are still skiing (nearly 2000 metre elevation). Due to delays, I reached no further than Covão dos Conches this day, and camped there illegally, as I was unable to reach the campground at Covão d'Amatade which was another 2–4 hours of hiking away (probably less than 2 in good conditions, but the steep trail down was tricky when I hiked it in heavy rain and half covered in snow). 

If you didn't bring rope with you on purpose, you may still have shoelaces. You could use them in a bowdrill to make a fire in an emergency (but you better know how to make and use a bowdrill well beforehand). Two plants that make good cordage here in the Pacific Northwest are Stinging Nettle and Fireweed. You can use it fresh and green, but if you properly dry it out you can get a very strong rope. Traditional rope is made by laying up. Take 2 strands and hold the ends together. Twist one a 1/2-turn one way around its own axis, and then wrap it a 1/2-turn around the other strand. Do it again with the other strand against the first. With practice you can add a 3rd strand to the mix. This is a very strong setup, as any weakness in 1 strand gets covered by the other 2. When one strand nears its end, overlap it with a new strand for a few twists. For a bigger rope, lay 3 smaller ropes up together. Repeat as needed for size & strength. 

A few others I could think of: Foxes Foxes are generally not aggressive are easily scared away by humans. However, there have been cases of fox attacks of on small children. It should be noted these incidents are very rare. Interestingly this appears to be more of an urban problem possibly caused by the close proximity between humans and foxes and the apparent trend of people feeding foxes in their gardens. Dogs Dog attacks are probably one of the larger 'wildlife' risks in the UK. According to this article there have been 5 deaths from dog bites since 2005, estimated >200,000 incidents per year resulting in approximately 6,000 hospital admissions. Recent legislation has increased the maximum sentence for dog attacks which cause injury from two to five years. Anecdotally I'll also add that dogs often try and run in front of my bike while cycling which could be another hazard. Birds of Prey There are many species of birds of prey in the UK some of which have been relatively recently re-introduced after becoming extinct due to hunting. Some are quite large (Sea eagles are the largest with a 2.5m wingspan. There are various reports of birds of prey attacking lambs. This has caused some unpopularity with farmers with reports of some birds being illegally poisoned on killed. There have also been fears that eagles may attack small children although there have been no reported cases and the RSPB calls these claims 'alarmist'. 

So it looks like that in 2010, there were indeed some sections with considerable snowpack, althoug lower foothills were snowfree. If this information can be trusted, that is; it does look like the resolution is rather poor. The map above has snow in valleys but not on glaciers, so I guess it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt. Therefore my question is: What are suitable areas for hiking in Eastern California around 10–20 May, if any? 

I honestly don't care if the measurement is 20 metre off. In the Swedish mountains, it usually isn't, there are no deep canyons, and if there are you can only go in one direction anyway (well, two). I don't need and I don't want a colour display, nor any map information. In Sweden, you really don't need a barometric altimetre. A compass takes battery life but you can get directional information by walking a bit in a certain direction, and in the Swedish mountains, this is almost always possible. The best way to maximise battery life is to get rid of all the useless stuff. I still want a GPS receiver that doesn't have a screen that's always on. All I want a handheld GPS-receiver to do is to tell me where I am (all models do) and keep a tracklog (all models do?). But when I'm in the wild for ten days, I don't want to have to carry 20 batteries. Therefore, my only consideration is: battery life. Did I mention battery life?
