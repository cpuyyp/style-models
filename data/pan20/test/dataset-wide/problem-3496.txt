Let's put the succinct answer by @TheAlmightyBob into an abstract model: We want to model the labor market. Markets' structure assumptions: goods market and labor markets are perfectly competitive. All participants are "too small" economically, and they cannot affect equilibrium price through their quantities demanded/supplied - they are "price takers". Markets "clear" - i.e. prices adjust so that quantity actually supplied equals quantity actually bought. Agents assumption: There are $n$ identical workers, and $m$ identical firms, that participate in the market. Both populations are fixed. Other assumptions: a) deterministic environment, b) one perishable good produced, c) model in "real terms" (real wage etc, scaled by the price of the good produced). The typical firm produces according to the technology $$Y_j = F_j(K_j,L_j;\mathbf q) \tag{1}$$ where $\mathbf q$ is a vector of parameters. Perfect competition in the goods market, and a perishable good imply that all output produced is sold.The goal of the firm is maximization of capital returns over the choice of labor. $$\max_{L_j} \pi_j = F_j(K_j,L_j;\mathbf q) - wL_j$$ We are modelling the labor market, so we are interested in the first-order condition $$\frac {\partial \pi_j}{\partial L_j} = 0 \tag{2}$$ and the corresponding input demand schedule $$L_j^* = L_j^*\left(K_j, \mathbf q, w\right) \tag{3}$$ Total Labor demand is $L_d = m\cdot L_j^*$. The labor market equilibrium assumption implies $$ L_d = L_s \Rightarrow m\cdot L_j^*\left(K_j, \mathbf q, w\right) = L_s \tag{4}$$ which implicitly expresses the equilibrium wage as a function of technology constants, of per-firm capital, and of labor supplied. In order to fully characterize the labor market, we need to derive also the optimal labor supply. Each identical worker derives utility from consumption and leisure, subject to a biological limit of available time, $T$, and the budget constraint that consumption equals wage income: $$\max_{L_i} U(C_i, T-L_i;\mathbf \gamma),\;\; \text{s.t.} \;C_i= wL_i$$ where $\gamma$ is a vector of preference parameters, indicating the relative weight between utility from consumption, and from leisure. This will give us individual labor supply as $$L_i^* = L_i^*(T,w, \mathbf \gamma) \tag{5}$$ and total labor supply is $L_s = n\cdot L_i^*$. Plugging this into $(4)$ we obtain $$mL_j^*\left(K_j, \mathbf q, w\right) =n L_i^*(T,w, \mathbf \gamma) \tag{6}$$ If we stop here, we have a partial equilibrium model that examines the labor market. We have fully described the market, and the goals and the constraints of the participants in it (firms and workers), related to the specific market. We can perform comparative statics in order to see how the various components of $(6)$ affect the equilibrium wage. Among them, there is the capital-per-firm term, whose effects on wage we can also consider based on $(6)$, by treating it as varying arbitrarily. In order to turn this model into a general equilibrium model: a) We need to specify things about capital: who owns it/controls it/makes decisions on it. What is the objective functions of these decision makers. This will lead us to an optimal $K_j^*$ as a function of the structure we will impose here. Then, comparative statics with respect to $K_j$ will turn into comparative statics with respect to the factors that affect the determination of $K_j^*$, which may very well prove to involve also $\mathbf q, w$ and even the other parameters in $(6)$, changing in this way the comparative statics results obtained in a partial equilibrium setting. b) We also need to take into account any macroeconomic identities that characterize this economy, something along the lines of $mY_j \equiv ...$ where the right hand side will be determined by the assumptions we make related to capital, but also, for example, by whether we will assume that the economy is closed or open, or partially open to the outside economic system. So, apart from being more complicated as a model, it may also lead us to different conclusions than partial equilibrium analysis. 

The paragraph is taken from paragraph from section 8.6 in Sargent and Ljungqvist. I understand that the fractions are independent of $s^t$, the state/complete history of realizations. However, I don't see how this leads to the second sentence -- there is extensive cross-history and cross-time consumption sharing. So my question is: why does the fractions of aggregate endowment assigned to each individual being independent of $s^t$ lead to cross-time and cross-history consumption sharing? Thanks 

I am looking for a paper (or textbook, or even lecture notes example) where there is a problem such as $$ \max f(x) \\ \text{ s.t. } \int g(x) \leq \int c $$ and there is at least some exposition/explanation about solving it. I believe that these are sometimes (often? always?) treated as infinite sum, but I may be wrong. In words, I am looking for an example and solution (or at least a discussion of solution) of a problem where the constraint contains an integral. It is okay (and probably will be the case) that $f(x)$ contains an integral too. I believe such optimization problems occur in macroeconomics. I'm specifically thinking of integrals over possible states, but the integral doesn't necessarily have to be over states. Or, if someone could explain solving such problems to me, that would be okay as well. Thanks. 

Here is my method, which is less rigorous but perhaps quicker, and I believe allows you to see the answer more easily, at least in this case. It may not be true in every case. Since the line segment will represent all combination of lawyers and M.B.A's that we can reach, it must include the extremes. That is, it must include the cases where we maximize the number of lawyers that we reach, and when we maximize the number of M.B.A's that we reach. In fact, these will be the endpoints (since if we are not maximizing one of these we have to be somewhere in-between). Because of this we can do the following: 1) Figure out how many lawyers we can reach, if we focus on only reaching lawyers. Well, the business magazine lets me reach $300$ lawyers for every $\$700$ I spend. The consumer magazine lets me reach $250$ lawyers for every $\$350$ I spend or equivalently $500$ lawyers for every $\$700$ I spend. This is important because we are comparing $\$700$ worth of one magazine to $\$700$ worth of another: we are making a $1:1$ comparison, which is necessary. What the above paragraph tells us is that, if I want to reach as many lawyers as possible, I should spend all my money on the consumer magazine ($500>300$). With a budget of $\$4200$ I can buy $4200/350 = 12$ ads. $12$ ads lets me reach $12*250 = 3000$ layers. So the most lawyers I can reach is $3000$. Additionally, $12$ consumer ads lets me reach $12*300=3600$ M.B.A's, hence one point (one extreme) is $$ (3000,3600) $$ To get the other point, find out how you can reach the most M.B.A's. One thing to note: The fact that things like $(0,3,600)$ are options should perhaps prompt you to consider maximizing the lawyers reached and maximizing the number of M.B.A's reached (since a $0$ indicates reaching none of one group). Not that doing so will be correct, but if you are stuck such a hint might lead you to the correct answer. Cheers. 

@denesp comments is right to the point as regards the scope of this question. In street-talk "Gentrification" just means "things get more expensive" ("rightly" or "wrongly", that's another matter). The displacement of poor people will happen, for those who remain poor, where here "poor" is a relative concept "poor enough not to be able to afford the new cost levels". What I believe is interesting here is to ask :"Assume that the amenities of an area increase in value, and so rents and "cost of living" goes up. If this value-increase of amenities is also increasing the productivity/efficiency/earnings of the local population, which effect will dominate?" Will the income-increase of local residents be enough to cover the increased costs of living? Instinctively speaking, I would say "no", if the productivity-increase comes through education, because the phenomenon of price-increases in such areas happens much faster than the time needed for education to bear income fruits. 

The main "De jure" (as the authors characterize it) resource (on which many scholars have built various indexes using wildly different methodologies) is the IMF's report Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) As the authors write, after presenting the various "De jure" indices, 

So, I don't see any change in the interpretation of Barro's paper. Both papers seem to accept that it may be the case that sticky wages arise from optimal, efficient behavior. Barro criticized sticky-wage models available then for not modeling such an efficient way to obtain the stickiness. Hall's accepts Barro's critique on past sticky-wage models, and creates a model where indeed, fixed wages can be a feature of an efficient equilibrium, something that Barro also considers it possible, as the above quote shows. 

There are various answers around the world that reflect and represent different political, ideological, philosophical and emotional points of view and stances -and there is the answer of Economics: 

It is a known result in Mechanism Design that both first-price as well as second-price auctions yield the same expected revenue, under certain conditions (like independence of valuations, private information, etc). Consult Jehle, G. A., & Reny, P. J. (2011). Advanced Microeconomic Theory (3d ed.), ch.9 on Auctions and Mechanism Design, for a very accessible exposition of the basics, as well as for the full set of conditions that must hold. The answer to your question is bound to be distribution-specific. Assume as an example, that, from the point of view of the seller, all (unknown to him) valuations of the bidders for the object for sale, come from a Uniform $U(0,1)$ distribution: this implies that we have normalized the value of the object for sale and that we express the possible valuations of it as a percentage of its possible maximum value, which is assumed common for all bidders. I.e. What we say here is :"we don't know how much each bidder actually values the object, but we do know that the maximum possible valuation by a bidder will be some $V>0$, and this $V$ is common to all bidders". We do not assert that there exists some bidder that actually values the object at $V$. In such a setup, the Expected Revenue of the Seller is $$ER(N) = \frac {N-1}{N+1} \tag {1}$$ where $N$ is the number of bidders. Again, this essentially expresses expected revenue as a fraction of the object (unidentified) maximum value. Now you can play around with $N$ to see how the expected revenue changes, in absolute, relative and percentage terms. It sure isn't changing linearly, but it is everywhere increasing in $N$, approaching unity (i.e. the object maximum valuation). This should be intuitive in the framework adopted: the more the bidders are, the more probable becomes to obtain higher and higher valuations of the object, and so also to sell it at a higher value. 

The question is not asking what you solved. You literally gave how much income would be needed by buy $90$ bottles at the new price. What the question is asking is basically "calculate the income effect, and add it to the original income, in order to cancel it out". That is, you solved for what he would have bought if there was no income or substitution effect, but the answer wants to know what he would have bought if there was no income but still a substitution effect. How the slutsky equation comes into play? That formula you gave is the income effect. The difference of two bottles is the substitution effect. From here on is an attempt at providing intuition that may be wrong in some aspect. I would not read it unless the above paragraphs did not make sense. At original prices and income you want to buy $90$ bottles. At the new price and income you want to buy $$ .02 \cdot 7500 - 2\cdot 40 = 70\text{ bottles} $$ you the quantity demanded has changed by $20$. That is, $$\frac{d x}{dp} = 20 $$ (counting a ten dollar price change as small, which is probably not the best assumption). The slutsky equation says that we can decompose this change in quantity demanded into an income and substitution effect. That is, \begin{align} \Delta x \text{ price change } = \Delta x \text{ substitution effect} + \Delta x \text{ income effect} \end{align} Our income has decreased by the number of bottles we were buying times the change in price (This is important to understand, IMO). Think about it, if you were buying $90$ bottles, and the price went up by $\$10$, now you are paying $90\cdot 10 = 900$ dollars more. Therefore, after the price change it is like we are facing prices of $\$30$ and income of $7500-900=\$6600$, if we are discussing the income effect. That is, if we are discussing the idea/thought/alternate reality where, instead of prices changing, we had prices be the same but instead our income decreased by $900$ dollars, we would demand $$ 6600\cdot .02 - 2\cdot 30 = 72 $$ Which means that we have a substitution effect of $2$ and an income effect of $18$. So to cancel the income effect, we would need enough original income to buy $70 +18$ bottles, which is $8400$ dollars. Now how/why these decompositions work I am still trying to better understand myself, so my reasoning may be off or wrong somewhere. There are also different ways to consider/define the income/substitution effects, which is something to take into consideration. 

I guess it just follows by definition. Assume that in the high state (for household $i$, aggregate endowment is 10, and household $i$ consumes $1/5 = 2$ of this, while having an endowment of $5$. Now consider what happens if we were in the low state (for household $i$), where household $i$ only gets $1$ of whatever endowment. However, if this is a high state for some other household(s), such that the aggregate endowment is still $10$, since the fraction is constant household $i$ still consumes $2$, even though they have a smaller endowment. Similarly for across time consumption sharing (although a bit weird since the model has no storage...). I guess it works that, if aggregate endowments are the same across two time periods, a household will consume the same amount regardless of whether their endowment was large or small (basically, they contribute to others when they have a lot (they lend), and they take contributions when they have little (they borrow). Thus, consumption smoothing.
