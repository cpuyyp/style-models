I ballpark the total number of fully fluent secondary speakers of these languages at no more than 700 million based on the chart above. Wikipedia's figures suggest that this number could be as high as 1.5 billion, but that's still far short of the 3-3.5 billion needed. Since Lewis gathered his statistics in "the early 1990's", when the world had a population of a little more than 5 billion, we can conclude that, for this stringent definition of bilingualism, there are far fewer bilinguals than monolinguals. However, other sources which use more relaxed definitions like "use at least 2 languages per day" offer evidence for why this claim exists. For example, this recent book (preview only) is cited by others in support of this claim. However, I can't find a good scholarly source for this claim that I can actually read. I rate it as "probable", given that something like a quarter of the world is bilingual under the very strict definition above. For instance, under this definition, my 10 hours of duolingo french, which I use to tease my wife (who is fluent in french) would possibly qualify me as "bilingual". I might only say a few sentences per week in French, but this isn't a high bar, and I might claim "daily" use if the question was phrased correctly. 

All the information that you need to revive an extinct specifies should be stored in the DNA. With present technology that means that you can theoretically revive specieses that died in the last ~100 000 years. There are currently efforts underway to revive mammoths. 

Are there real studies that support the usage of colloidal silver? Are there studies that show it doesn't work? 

There seem to be a two studies that tested the ability of practioners of that method and it found that they can substantially influence their body temperature. 

On Theranos website they say they sell Testosterone (Free) $17.33 while other labs sell them for $130.00. I want to know whether that's an accurate description of the prices of Theranos competition. Unfortunately most of the relevant tests don't get sold via internet and I therefore don't think a single example of another company that sells the test for less than $130.00 disproves Theranos claim. I think for Theranos claim to be true, insurance companies would have to reimburse tests that charge $130.00. If it can be shown that no insurance company reimbuses $130.00 I would consider Theranos claim to be false. 

Justification for claim 1: There are a number of studies on the subject, and you've cited several of them in your question. The WHO report here offers a reasonable overview of the state of research circa 1997, and concludes 

This is an interesting question. I've seen this idea bandied about personal finance blogs and forums before, and always thought it was a bit nutty, since, as noted in the comments to this question, paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first will minimize both total payments and time until you are debt free. Despite this, it is a notable claim, and one that is widely repeated (at least in my experience). It turns out this strategy has been studied very recently by the US "National Bureau of Economic Research" (NBER), which appears to be a think-tank devoted to economic policy issues. They claim to be "non-partisan", though I have no way of verifying this. The introduction of their working paper (page 1) provides a good synopsis of the claim and reasons why it might be true. The claim was popularized by radio host Dave Ramsey. This paper also cites a 2012 analysis of data gathered from a debt collections agency, which showed that the snowball method was actually an extremely effective strategy for people in arrears. The number of accounts closed so far turns out to be a strong predictor of closing more accounts, regardless of the dollar amounts on the individual accounts. The dollar amounts paid off so far, in contrast, were not predictive. The 2012 study already answers the question empirically (yes, at least for people sent to collections agencies, the snowball is effective), but the 2014 study investigates why this might be in much more detail, and proposes a full mathimatical model for the actions of human agents in paying off the debt (it looks like a great read, and doesn't seem to be paywalled). They also offer experimental results on a different set of tasks, showing that humans both i) perform tasks faster (voluntarily) when the tasks are ordered from fastest to slowest instead of slowest to fastest or randomly ii) humans are more likely to complete the entire set of tasks when they are ordered from shortest to longest than the other way round (71% completion rate vs. 48%!), or randomly (71% vs. 58%!). Interestingly, although past research found that, given the choice, humans prefer to pay off debt by ordering it from smallest to largest, in this study humans who were allowed to order their tasks actually preferred to do that largest ones first, even though this was less efficient! 

Is this true? Or: Did John Safran get a fatwa placed on Australian television host Rove McManus? It supposedly took place in episode one of John Safran vs. God: 

The claim is repeated in a few online news articles, e.g., hindustantimes.com, firstpost.com, NDTV.com, but seems to be contradicted by Zakir Naik himself ("I have always condemned terrorism" in the above). Question: Did Zakir Naik say "every Muslim should be a terrorist"? 

I can even watch the Dalai Lama and Lady Gaga video at smh.com.au without any problems. I didn't find it particularly interesting, but I had no problems accessing it. 

Almost identical quotes can be found on Baptist News Global, an EventBrite event, Before It's News, Christian Examiner, Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Charisma News (all dated fairly recently). My question is simply: is the claim true? I find it very hard to believe a transgender woman would be willing to expose herself, let alone to 6-year old girls. I also feel that indecent exposure laws would still apply, transgender or not. 

The claim is repeated in the titles of articles by the Washington Post ("China bans Lady Gaga after the pop superstar meets with the Dalai Lama") and CNET.com ("Lady Gaga is now banned in China"). Basically, I'm wondering if this is actually true, or just some kind of yellow peril mongering. Question: Was Lady Gaga banned from China? I live in China, so I can just search for these articles in Baidu, the dominant search engine in China (since Google is blocked). Here's some screenshots (accessible without a proxy): 

Is it true that the story that Arbesman and other tell about how the misplacement of a decimal point by Erich von Wolff lead to a popular misconception about the iron content of spinach is false? 

Kyle Eggimann writes on his blog LuckyGunnar in an article titled "Muscle Memory: Combat-Proven Self-Defense Training Tips": 

The person who wins the challenge for social dominance is more likely to engage in more challenges for social domiance through his raised testosterone. The loser of the conflict reduces his testosterone and therefore is less likely to try to be socially dominant again and fail again. 

Ranbaxy is a good example of a company that simply faked a lot of their data. Katherine Eban wrote a very good article in Fortune that summarizes the episode: 

Asking whether a psychological model like this is true or false is a bad question. If you want to evaluate such a model you have to ask yourself whether the model is able to make useful predictions. An example of a very bad psychology model would be the model that astrology proposes. You have 12 different personality traits that all depend on when the person got born. If you use that model and observe people's behavior you can't predict at all when they got born. In physics Newton created a quite useful model for the way gravity works. Newton's model makes useful predictions. You can use it to effective calculate the aerodynamics of airplane travel. Words like dominance and aggression are theoretical constructs that humans invented to describe reality. If you ask two different observers whether a behavior is dominant, they are more likely than chance to agree. There are however also cases where the two observers will disagree. You can't measure the quantity of dominance as finely as you can measure the speed of an object. As a result a concept that uses terms like domiance is unable to make predictions with 99.9% certainty. If you have two people and judge their dominance you can't predict their testosterone levels with 99.9% certainty. But let's get back to the definition of male behavior: Most males have a higher testosterone level than females. Testosterone does have an effect on behavior. If one wants to avoid vague human created terms like 'domiance' and 'aggression', it's tempting to define male behavior as that behavior that's created by a higher testosterone level. Since testosterone levels are in principle less fuzzy than old psychological terms like 'dominance' there some idealistic hope that it's a better definition. Giving the complexity of human behavior it's however hard to invent good categories and some people might find it more useful to use words like 'dominance' and 'aggression' because they can better imagine what those words mean. 

Does marijuana consumption make it more difficult for a driver to operate a motor vehicle? The answer to this question is Yes. Does marijuana consumption prior to operating a motor vehicle increase the risk of serious injuries or death during operation? The answer to this question is probably No, and at best that much more study is needed. Certainty it is nothing like the same risk increase as driving drunk 

However, as noted in a 1999 meta-study out of John Hopkins (which I consider to be an exceptionally well done paper in general, not just on this topic), the studies considered in the WHO report 

Although the findings of the first study are based on a theoretical model, they appear to be well supported by the available empirical evidence. This 2002 paper (apparently originally published in Nature) claims that during the fox hunting ban produced by an outbreak of Foot-In-Mouth disease, fox populations did not increase overall. The study's authors state "Our results argue against suggestions that fox populations would increase markedly in the event of a permanent ban on hunting." Another paper, published in Science, interviewed a random sample of several hundred farmers, gamekeepers, foresters, and related professions, from across Britain. A large majority of this group (~2/3) believed that a ban on hunting with hounds would have no impact on their ability to control the fox population with lethal methods. 

Genetic engineering is a bit like cars. Humans always moved from place to place. Having cars allows us to go faster. That's both good and bad. It allows us to save time but also increases the accident rate. For a longer analysis the Long Now foundation hosted a high level debate about GMO with synthetic biology. 

Various news outlets report like Slate that Julian Assange suggested that Seth Rich gave the documents to Wikileaks. I will start with my interpretion of what Julian said. He saw Julian Assange two times at the Chaos Computer Congress in Berlin giving a speech and talk with various hackers in that space, so I think I can decently parse what Julian is saying. It a circle of people who don't think in terms of Democrats and Republicans but who's political agenda is very different. That doesn't seem to have been the case. Julian Assange is a man who tends to speak in a precise way. Julian Assange gave an interview for Dutch TV (Transcript). In it he brings up the case of the DNC staffer Seth Rich being shot in a way that hasn't yet been officially found to be a robbery concerning. The moderator asks him what he's suggesting and he answers: 

Unfortunately, this statistic is unreferenced (or, at least, it's not directly referenced; there's a bunch of references, but it's not clear which the statistic might be in). I found a similar unreferenced claim in the article 3 Women Are Killed Every Day By Their Partners ... at the Huffington Post and in the article Three Women Are Murdered by Their Husbands, Boyfriends Every Day in America at AlterNet. Question: In the US, are three women killed each day by their male partners? 

The Salafi Movement Wikipedia page currently quotes Zakir Naik as saying "every Muslim should be a terrorist". They cite a TIME article: Von Drehle and Ghosh, An Enemy Within: The Making of Najibullah Zazi, 2009, which appears to be replicated here, which says: 

Other sources: Information Engine; The Simple Truth; WHIS News. (There is also a YouTube video, although I can't access it from China, so I'm unaware of its contents.) I'm pretty sure this is just made up (or a hoax?). Can this be confirmed/denied? The image in the news article shows an exhausted looking woman surrounded by 17 babies. Their motor skills are too advanced for babies born "last weekend". The woman also appears to be of a different ethnicity to the babies. (Although, there might be some explanation for this that I haven't thought of.) It also seems at odds with how difficult it is to give multiple births; Wikipedia writes:
