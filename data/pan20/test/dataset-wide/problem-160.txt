What about putting an edge and a hilt on one of these babies: Folding bike locks are designed to not break, so you are looking at something less flimsy than hollow telescoping swords. You could put in stoppers at each of the joints (I don't know what they're called, the ones where it locks into places and you push a button to release it) to lock each section at 180°. If this was well-oiled, a quick flick would fold each section out until it locked, leaving you with a nice sword that isn't hollow - the weak points are the joints/stoppers, so over-engineering them would be a good plan. Edit: forgot to say: Yes it's going to be at an angle. Yes you have to deal with it. If your segments are thin, it shouldn't be too big a deal. 

Let's go by a basic sound principle: higher-frequency sounds are absorbed quicker than low frequency sounds. For stealthy purposes, this means that someone in the next room is less likely to hear a squeak as opposed to a burp, volumes being equal. This is also beneficial for our spy as it means that the echoes from their high-pitched emission are more localised to close-by objects - they don't get as much cross-talk from further objects. Bats use ultrasound for echo location; I believe recorded cases of human echo location also uses high-pitched clicks. Now, is a high-pitched click appropriate for a spy? Probably not. But what were common in the middle ages? Rats. Lots of rats. And rats use high-pitched sounds themselves. A spy sneaking around and making squeaking rat sounds would probably be safely ignored - unless they had broken into the kitchen! 

Okay but when you assume the same athmospheric composition, and therefore also mass of any given quantity of air, you can't just say "gravity is such, AND/BUT air pressure is such", you have to calculate air pressure (at any given height) from gravity, because it is dependent on how much air is above it in the athmosphere, which in turn is dependent on how much air the planet can hold by ist mass/gravity. Sorry, I can't seem to find how to do that just this Moment, (which is why I can't even tell if that 1/3 - 1/2 Thing you started with is maybe correct), but I'm quite sure that is how it works. Unless you factor in Magic/some weird substance or structure that stably exists in the upper athmosphere/a mechanism by which gravity affects gases differently than solids... 

Third Person doctor/helper is a non-biological Person (Robot), or a sapient non-mammal, or a human with a very serious blood bourne infection, or some blood toxicity Thing. All very good reasons not to use their own blood 

Emphasis mine. Wikipedia also provides a quick how-to on where you an acquire some if you can't find any in the lab. 

Tar pits Why invent a new trap when nature has one that it's been using for thousands of years? And they're self concealing! A few years of dust and no one will ever suspect that the bones of a few dozen explorers lie beneath their feet until it is too late. 

To add to the list of horribly dangerous chemicals... Hydrofluoric Acid There are plenty of acids that are more dangerous than HF, but it would probably be significantly harder for your heroes to get their hands on fluoroantimonic acid, triflic acid or the like. And HF is plenty dangerous on its own. From the Wikipedia article: 

It could go either way, but I'd lean towards cooperation. I saw a documentary a few years back (which I unfortunately can't find at the moment) about a group of Israeli and Palestinian kids who were brought together for a while. As best I remember it, the kids entered with the prejudices they inherited from their parents, but upon meeting each other they abandoned them pretty quickly and became friends. I don't remember if any of the kids had been directly impacted by the conflict. I also don't remember the ages of the kids. What I understood from that was that the hatred and prejudice that fuel the conflict are taught to the youth at a very young age. But at the same time they are more flexible and will more quickly forget their differences than adults would in the right circumstances. And external threats are excellent at uniting people. 

Human Breasts. Because it is very implausible for a newborn whose spine is curved in the way that a centaur's must be, and who can't possibly have more developed Motor skills than that prime example of mammalian precocialness that is a horse foal, to bend down /curl around to reach the udder. Assuming the centaur Baby is the same size in relation to the mother, as a horse foal, the Standing offspring would not quite reach the nipples at birth and either require the mother to kneel, or use a Kind of step stool. And then they would be tall enough to comfortably reach the breast after a few weeks, and would know when to wean when they grow so tall they would have to bend down... again with the spine Also, suckling from the upper Body is just cuddly and nice and allows for eye contact and hugs, so I feel that would be more appropriate for a species that has both eyes in front and participates in somewhat human-like social interactions (If that's what you're going for). 

We start by pointing NASA's Deep Space Network at the appropriate point in our solar system. We move them if necessary. I don't know how long this will take. Now we can measure any gravitational-signal responses send back by the aliens. Then we come to the harder part. Generating the signal. So, gravity produces gravitational waves, as we have recently proved using two interacting black holes. Now I'm not going to suggest we create two black holes in our solar system (disclaimer: OK, I was going to suggest that we did that using our wormhole-generating technology until I read the question saying that we need to stick with current tech levels). However, those black holes were far away which is why they needed to be big to detect them. Can we get a similar effect by using smaller objects nearby? I have no idea, but since I haven't been paid yet as the lead scientist on this project, I'm going to say "Yes, with absolute certainty"! We make two Space JCBs. They are load-carrying spaceships. Then we fill up their load bins with heavy things (rocks, or lead, or uranium, or asteroids, or whatever is most fun). Now, the fun part. We send these Space JCBs to the point where we detected our aliens, and get them to play Space Chicken. We get these Space JCBs to fly towards each other, leaving only the tiniest of margins where they don't crash into each other. Their masses interacting will produce a gravitational wave, which since it's so close (or possibly inside) the alien spaceships, should be Super Easy to Detect™. However, for all these aliens know, that was just an asteroid crashing into another one, or however they explain common things occurring on the Light Side. So let's do it again. And again. And again. And again. But let's set up a specific pattern: a coding, if you will. Let's do one pass. Then wait. Then two passes. Then wait. Then three, and wait. Five, wait. Eight, wait. Thirteen, wait. Twenty-one, wait. I think you know what's next. That's right, back to one. This Fibonacci sequence was getting too long, so we'll stick to repeating this sequence up to twenty-one passes. Let's do this for an unreasonably long amount of time, or until the aliens notice, and our detector picks up some sort of coded activity in the wait periods - my hope is that our alien friends will start to pre-empt our numbers by filling in the wait periods, showing us that they are receiving our signals, understanding the sequence, and able to communicate back at us. ? Profit. 

Alternatively, if you are interested in lighting the werewolf on fire you can always go for dioxygen difluoride. 

Unlikely, but it doesn't necessarily need to Existing spacecraft don't need to deal with relativistic speeds, but they still move incredibly fast. And while satellite-destroying meteors are rare, micrometeors are pretty common. A meter of shielding is far beyond the budgets of any spacecraft we currently build. Instead of trying to use thick solid shields, modern spacecraft rely on Whipple Shielding. A Whipple Shield is a spaced shield - it has two layers with a gap between them. The first layer intercepts obstacles, but it isn't intended to stop them - its purpose is to disperse the energy over a larger area. 

Noninterference clause The gods are bound by a set of complex and mostly unknown god-rules. One of the primary rules is that a god cannot directly interfere with the chosen of other gods. The noble god interprets this rule much more strictly than the duplicitous god does. 

Most of the (very few) People that would survive would be those that were already blind but Hearing before everyone became blind and deaf, and that were also used to a somewhat Independent and also low-tech Lifestyle, and situated in a Location where the infrastructure for such a life was already established. Some forms of self-sufficient gardening, as well as taking care of dairy animals in a non-intensive farming situation, are much harder to do for blind people but still completely possible, and don't necessarily require Hearing. 

"a species has the psychological effects of alcohol"??? Question is somewhat unclear. Do you mean a species of which every individual, all the time, experiences the symptoms that humans get from alcohol intoxication? How can you even measure that? Human alcohol intoxication effents are only defined by Deviation from how unintoxicated human Brains work. A species whose Brains are inherently wired in such a way that they can never function better than humans at the alcohol Level you mentioned, would be somewhat less likely to survive or have evolved. Or, the other way, a species that somehow(?) has effects of alcohol, would have evolved to inherently, by how their Brains are wired, have superhuman concentration, Inhibition, reasoning, depth perception, what have you, so they would always compensate and have competitive abilities like humans 

You all are picking boring animals. Let's go look at the extinct list! I'd start with a glyptodont. It's basically a giant armadillo. It's strong but slow, and a quick shaman with a knife should be able to get past its armor without trouble. Now that you are invulnerable from the neck down, it's time for some strength. Bears are the obvious choice, but I think that they are probably outmatched by the 1,000 kg giant ground sloth. Now it's time to get some speed and endurance. Here the pronghorn is probably your best bet, if you can catch one. Sneaking up on one in the open plains where they live might be difficult, though, so you might turn instead to the majestic moose, which can clock in at 35 mph for over 500 m are excellent swimmers and can kick in every direction. For stealth and a wicked pouncing leap it's time to go jaguar hunting. And now you're ready to face your mammoth! 

Well the way that we know about dark matter is by the gravitational effects it has. This is then a place to start generating our communication system. We are using our current levels of technology. OK, great. We can currently send things into space. We can also currently detect local levels of gravitation - . Taking these two facts, and using some our own dontaskium (similar to alien's handwavium but light instead of dark) to generate the appropriate governmental and public support and funding for our venture, we do this: 

NO What is the appeal of your MMORPG - do you know this or can you find out e.g. do XY testing on popularity of limiting this behaviour? Are people drawn to the realism, and does this include the capacity for cruelty and genuine response? If so, then from the business perspective you can't do this: granting AIs human rights makes such behaviour illegal, which your MMORPG can't support. You also can't remove the behaviour, as people will not want to play. The question comes down to a matter of public perspective: "consciousness" is not as hardly delineated as we like to believe - but we do like to believe it is. If you release public statements saying that you understand people's concerns, but that these NPCs are art not people: much like a painting or statue that may inspire high emotion in people, they are designed as conduits for our own internal feelings, but not actually alive. More philosophical thoughts on "human rights" in virtual contexts (you can use this in your press release if you want) - humans are not simply a sentient mind, they are a physical body whose form, abilities and weaknesses shapes our physical minds in every single thing we do. We cannot simply be copied, backed up, reverted to a previous version, have memories deleted, etc - our physical form is integral to making our personalities, desires, phobias, mind-states, rationalities and irrationalities what they are. Being "human" is not only self-awareness (or the appearance there-of) - it is the unique interaction between our bodies and brain and the environment and evolutionary history that has lead us to our survival. Virtual minds, sentient or otherwise, could be simulated to have these feelings - but in the same way that I cannot eat the picture of food on my PC screen (still lamenting this after 20 years of internet), simulation is an inherently different process than "human experience". Note that I am not saying better, worse or other value judgements - just different, and that "human rights" are not applicable. 

Even as the first layer gets perforated, the holes are small and don't significantly compromise the layer's structural integrity. The second layer isn't penetrated by the more diffuse impact, and maintains an airtight seal. There are, of course, many variations on the design that Fred Whipple proposed in 1946. You can use more than just two layers - that way if the energy is not sufficiently dispersed by the first impact, it can be dispersed several more times before risking your final layer. You can use flexible materials such as Kevlar instead of rigid aluminum. But the basic principles remain the same. By using multiple layers separated by gaps you disperse the impacting energy and make it possible to protect your ship with a great deal less shielding than you would need with a solid shield. 

In an effort to aid conservation, this city put into place several ordinances which make it difficult and expensive to remove trees unless they demonstrate a clear danger to the nearby structures. There are tax breaks available for modifying buildings to accommodate nearby growth without harming it. By the time the tree was big enough for the neighbors to complain, it was an integral structural component of the building and couldn't possibly be removed safely. (Which will be a problem when the tree dies, but all involved are hoping it lays long enough for that to be someone else's problem. )
