If your handwavium gas is a compount of gravity-negatium (say for the sake of chemistry handwavium gas is gravity-negatium pentahydride) and gravity-negatium has a nucleus that really massively is repelled by normal mass... and ignoring the fact that all the handwavium would have scooted up out of the atmosphere just as fast as it could... you could make a suit of armour that had no weight at all. But as others have pointed out, it would still have mass. You could stand up in your brass/handwavium armour that masses 1 tonne, but the amount of power needed to get a single leg moving would be akin to towing sacks of sand. And once it was moving, it wouldn't readily stop. So if my some miracle you got your leg moving, you'd have to expend the same amount of energy to stop it when you put your foot down for the next pace. And if my some miracle you got yourself running at full charge towards the enemy, you'd be like an oil tanker with a five mile stopping distance. Effectively, you would be about as mobile as if you were standing inside a pill-box, great for getting in the way of things but useless for fighting. 

If you build with arches (or vaulting which is sort of the 3-d equivalent if you consider a wall as 2-d) there's no tensile strength needed... all the load is compressive. You can use precision-cut blocks or just about any material that will stick together to fill the gaps between blocks that are not precision cut. So you can build using whatever rocks are available... and anything that is vaguely cement-like for gap-filling. The building material doesn't have to need any tensile strength and nor does the filling material, it just needs enough strength to hold itself in place. You could even use something like lead hammered in. Look at all the mediaeval cathedrals in Europe, Roman aqueducts, castles... all of them are just about 'heaps' of stone in compressive loading with nothing tensile at all. You only need reinforced concrete or steel or timber to make lintels and flat spans... without it, you're limited to arches and somewhat more massive floors - you built a barrel-vault 'ceiling' and then you probably fill the top of the barrel vault up with loose fill to get a 'level' surface for the next floor up. Okay, no wood for the roof, you just make it vaulted and waterproof... and fit drains. No skyscrapers, but you can build several floors up before the walls at the bottom get so massive they use all of the room space. But it's a lifeless planet... so you can build wide and low, there are no neighbours to complain. 

Rules: In this society, people are required to carry out life as either a "Provider" or a "Dependent". Providers: 

I'm not attempting a complete answer since this is my question, but a few things that immediately come to mind are: The caste system of society would be substantially equalized in comparison to Earth's current circumstances.  Economic development would be more efficient; as there would be no "inherited" positions of power in business, politics, etc., and as such - those types of positions would be entirely subject to individual merit.  "Elite" families would be much less prevalent; as their success would be solely contingent upon sustained motivation, effort, & strategy throughout generations. Marriage would generally be much more successful & authentic.  In order for a spouse to benefit from their partner's assets, their only option would be to maintain a healthy relationship.  They would not financially benefit from divorce, the untimely death of their partner, or from having a child with them ( other than receiving a bare-minimum of sustenance until the child is of mandated age, in the event of the provider's death ). Crime ( particularly robbery of individuals ) would be greatly reduced, since credits cannot be acquired by non-legitimate means. 

Oveview: People cannot keep any assets ( both financial & physical ) attained during their lifetime within their bloodline. Assets are best utilized for enhancing your quality of life ( + your spouse & children, if you opt for that lifestyle ) and/or making an impact in the world however you choose. Assets are non-transferable, even to your spouse & children. If they choose to give up their dependent status, they must make their way in the world armed only with the education & life perspective you helped them to develop. Upon death, all remaining assets are liquidated and invested into socioeconomic development. Does it work? What does life look like? Potential benefits & disadvantages? Points to consider: 

Physical money has been rendered obsolete.  All monetary assets are in the form of digital credits, which are directly linked to individuals and are only transferable in exchange for goods & services.  A programmatic system is in place to minimize fraudulent transfer of assets in the form of overpaying for goods & services. Individuals who have opted not to assume dependents are bound by the same rules as providers. Any dependents entering the same career or political arena as their provider will be subject to additional scrutiny by the board of said arena.  They must be proven to be competent in all skills required, and will not be given preference over other candidates. In the event that a provider dies while their dependents are not capable of sustaining themselves; the provider's credits will be transferred to the dependents in a weekly recurring amount, which is dictated by State regulated terms.  Credits will also be directly applied to maintenance of essential assets as described below.
