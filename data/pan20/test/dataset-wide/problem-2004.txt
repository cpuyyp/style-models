With single-person restrooms, it makes no sense at all to designate some as "for women" and some "for men". Just approach HR (or management) and say something like "I've noticed that the men's rooms are often occupied. In a previous company they solved this problem by having unisex bathrooms. Can we do that here?" 

These are all possibilities. But if you want to know the actual reason for your particular situation, the only way to find out is to ask. (And even then you probably won't get an answer). Startups tend to be like that. Things never stay the same for long. 

Twenty years or indefinitely are far, far less likely to be achievable. I don't think I've ever seen a Non-Compete that specified twenty years, an I know I've never seen one designed to last indefinitely. The courts (at least in the US) don't like to prevent people from being able to work in their chosen profession. 

I assume refusing to comply with your director would be a bad career move. And I assume asking for your annual evaluation is a regular (annual) thing. And I assume you have been performing your annual evaluation without first having had a raise for at least the past 5 years. Thus, I suggest you do what you are told to do, or you may wind up on the receiving end of unintended career changes - despite the guidance of your doctors. Have you felt depressed and stuck for 26 years? If not - what changed to make you feel this way? Examine your feelings to learn where they are coming from - that may lead you to feeling better, or to deciding what you want to do. 

Yes. In this business, change is continual and relatively rapid. If you want to continue in software you must get used to change, learn to accept it, and learn how to continually adapt. Otherwise, you'll be left behind. 

Ask for whatever you want. If you don't ask, you won't get. You have to decide if the risk of asking equates to "pushing too far" or not. You'll have to decide that based on your knowledge of the company and manager. And based on your comment of "guess what: never saw a penny of it" you have to decide if this is the kind of company you want to work for or not. A raise seems extremely reasonable (I expect all interns to get more when they are signed on as permanent employees), payment for a past "promise" is a bit more iffy. You may have to have a long discussion about what that "promise" actually meant. Clearly, since you aren't receiving anything yet, there is a difference of opinion here. You really aren't in a position to demand anything. You can threaten walking out if you don't get what you want. Only you are in a position to judge if this would be likely to be effective or not. If you are granted anything, make sure you get it in writing this time, rather than just a "promise". That way, you'll avoid issues like the ones you are experiencing now. 

Since "Web Applications Developer" was not actually your title, then Yes - that would be a lie. Think of it this way - if a potential employer were to call your current employer and ask if you held the title "Web Applications Developer" would you want them to say "No, kacpr didn't hold that title"? However, your resume should include not only your title, but descriptive text indicating the work you actually performed. In there, you can indicate that you developed web applications. Additionally, you will want to develop a Cover Letter specifically tailored to the specific job and company for which you are applying. In that letter, you can provide details of your work which will tell the potential employer what you did and not just what title you held. 

The fact that you include the phrase "without telling his company/boss" leads me to suspect you already know this isn't a good idea. You do not have the right to print and disburse business cards that would lead the recipient to believe you are representing your company, without gaining their permission first. You could instead produce personal cards, leaving off all aspects of your company affiliation, if you choose. Omit the company name, address, phone number, email, logo, etc. You could include your title, website URL, personal email and home phone number. Then you could hand those personal cards out whenever you desire (such as at a networking event or professional society meeting), without asking your company for permission - not on company time, or on the company premises, of course. If you really want to know if your company would let you do something - ask them first! 

Often that means that she cannot recruit folks from company A to come and work with her. I've had this sort of contract before. Honestly, it's not really much of a barrier. If she suggests that you send your resume to someone else at company B and then company B hires you, she won't have recruited you directly. That's what I've done several times, and it has never been a problem for me. On the other hand if she is saying "I can't hire you because of my non-compete agreement", it means one of two things. Either she has a far stronger agreement in her prior contract that I've ever had, or she doesn't really want to hire you for some reason. If she is a good friend, you might be able to discuss it with her and find out the real reason. If she isn't a good personal friend, you may not know for sure. 

I don't know any Developers who wear ties and/or suits at work these days. In my area, the norms seem to run from anything goes (shorts, flip-flops, etc), to business casual (shoes, khakis and a shirt with buttons and a collar). But it would depend on the culture in your locale and at your workplace. It's possible (although unlikely) that formal dress is the norm at your new shop. If you interviewed on-site, you could have looked around and see how others were dressed - that would be a clue. Similarly, how the folks that interviewed you were dressed is a clue. But if you still aren't sure, you could do what I did when I was young and unsure. Call the office. Talk to the receptionist, HR or office manager, and ask how other Developers are dressed. While it might feel awkward to ask that question, you are likely to get some friendly help, just as I did. 

Be prepared to constantly recruit, replace and retrain these workers, no matter which option you choose. In all cases, they are unlikely to stick around for long and can be expected to leave as soon as they can get a better offer. 

Sounds like you have to ask your employer for some time off, and ask them if/how you can get paid. Talk with HR and find out if there is some sort of FMLA, paid Sabbatical, or short-term disability that would cover you. Some companies with generous personal leave policies will accommodate this - particularly if you have been there a long time and are a good an trusted employee. Other will not. 

In the extremely unlikely event that the company brings up your survey answers, just deny that they were yours. It cannot be proven that mapping characters this way produces unique results for everyone. 

I don't think it's stupid - in fact it's becoming rather commonplace in many of the companies in my part of the world. That said, I'm not sure I've ever seen this sort of thing tied to a percent of salary, but rather a fixed number of dollars. If someone were offering a 10% bonus, that could be a rather hefty chunk of change. Where I currently work, they have a "Wellness Program", championed by HR. You attain "bonus points" for certain activities deemed "healthy" by the company. For example, if you have an annual physical, you get 50 points. If you have your biometric screening performed (BMI, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc), you get 125 points. And so on, and so on. Once you get 300 points, you are given $250. And your spouse can earn $250 the same way. From an HR point of view, this improves the health of the company, is generally viewed as a "nice thing to do for employees", supposedly leads to a reduction in absences, and perhaps a future reduction in insurance premiums. I don't know the participation rate, although I'm sure it's less than 50%. And I don't know if the company has actually measured the impact of this program on productivity or absences. I don't think this would work as well if a single department attempted to implement it, if it weren't fully supported from the top of the company, or if the monetary rewards were tied to a percent of salary rather than a fixed amount. But those are just my feelings, I've haven't fully analyzed the impacts, and I'm not an HR professional. I have friends in other companies in my area who have implemented similar policies, although the details seem to differ slightly pretty much everywhere. Some companies don't try to directly measure any of this, but just offer discounts toward "healthy living" businesses, like gyms, yoga, etc. If you are the CEO of your company, I commend you for thinking along these lines. If you are at a lower-level, I suspect it might be more impactful if you try to convince HR to champion this for the entire company, rather than try to get it implemented for just your span of control. Seems like a good idea overall. 

I wouldn't use the term "irrelevant". And I'm not sure that's actually the consensus opinion. Once you have an established professional track record, whatever you did prior to working isn't as significant. That includes your GPA. That said, a high GPA is always better than a low GPA, even if it only matters a little. And there is always going to be the occasional interviewer who likes to see a high GPA for whatever their personal reasons might be. 

Accepting for a moment that all of these assumptions and generalizations about the difference between men and women are true, there are two things you can do. First (and most obvious) - work for a woman! Clearly, a woman will share your sense that excellent work should be rewarded, and will thus reward you for your excellent work. Second - get a woman mentor. A mentor has already gone though more negotiations and thus will have experience that she can pass on to you. Perhaps this woman and your boss could be the same person. Be careful about assumptions, though. Not all women are the same. Not all men are the same. Expecting all women to think and act like you, may not be a good prescription for success. And expecting that no men think or act like you may be dangerous as well. In my career, I've worked with and for many women as well as men. I've had many women as well as men working for me. I'd be lying if I said I could split them into two camps along gender lines. Over that period, I've learned to check and double-check my assumptions about gender and other stereotypes. 

It's a great idea! You can demonstrate your continued interest, signal your desire to hit the ground running once you start, and be even more prepared for a fast beginning to your career. What manager wouldn't want to see that sort of enthusiasm? You really shouldn't worry about what sort of expectations of your performance you are setting - you want you new manager to have high expectations, and you want to be in a position to deliver on those expectations. If you have already signed a Non-Disclosure, then it should at least be possible. But your company may still not want to give you more details until you have been through the complete onboarding/training process, and are actually on the payroll. It's also possible that the project details are still in flight, so sending them to you may not be as useful as hoped. Still, it's worth asking. If you sense any hesitation on your manager's part, you can always back off of your request. And you'll still get "brownie points" for showing how eager you are. I once made a similar request after agreeing to join a new company. I got some interesting work to do in my spare time leading up to my first day, and even got to design and lay out a new computer room. The week I joined, I felt like I really belonged.
