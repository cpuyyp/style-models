It is important to note that within the G and PG ratings the assumption is competent at the grade and at placing protection. This means that a 5.9 route with a huge run out on 5.7 terrain above a ledge with a horrendously tricky and strenuous, but bomber, placement to protect the crux would get a G rating. 

While I am not brave enough to call John Dunne fat, Climbing Magazine did. So there is at least one objectively fat climber that could send 5.14. That man can float up some seriously hard stuff: $URL$ 

I am a big fan of City of Rocks and the Albion Mountains in Idaho. While some of the peaks are over 8500 feet, there is a lot of hiking at lower elevations. There is a lot of exposed granite and much of the hiking is above treeline. 

I am looking for an article that was published in either Rock and Ice or Climbing Magazine around 1999. I know the area and route the article is about as well as the author's name. I may even have a copy of the cover image and/or and image used in the article. Are there digital back issues of the magazine? Is there a search function? Are there libraries that would have back issues in print (or microfilm)? 

One thing that has not been mentioned is to consider which trail head you park at. Some trails/areas have multiple trail heads. If you have a choice in trail head, it is worth talking to locals to determine if any are particularly problematic. In my experience the most problematic trail heads are those with easy access. What this means is that often if the only available trail heads are problematic, that there are alternatives to parking directly at the trail head. Sometimes you can park in town (e.g., Walmart in the US or an outfitters) and catch a shuttle, hitch, carpool, or even bicycle to the trail head. 

The Savage River State Forest and Garrett State Forest also allow backpack camping throughout the forest. 

In places where the contour lines are closer together, the slope is steeper. Where the lines are further apart, the slope is gentler. In a spot where you see several lines merge together, that is a sheer drop-off. Avoid those, obviously. Look for nesting Vs on the map. These are ridges, or possibly ravines. Water (blue) bisecting the V will tell you it is a valley. Through practice, I can pretty distinguish a ravine from a ridge in a few seconds. Sorry, I can’t describe a technique for that. * Perhaps I am recommending spending time poring over contour maps ;—) Be aware of the scale of the map and the level of elevation change for the map. In America, the USGS topographical maps generally go with 20’ per contour line. Some use 6m, but the style is distinct. We also have some maps with 40’ contours done in the same style as the 20’. Read carefully. My brain is trained to see that style of map and see 20’ contours. I have gotten myself into some difficulty expecting the terrain to be not so bad, but finding it quite steep in 3-D. Also, realize that because of the nature of maps, there can be an awful lot of terrain variety hiding between two contour lines. The scree slopes you mentioned will be quite irregular. * Having thought this over, if you are planning an off-trail hike, definitely spend some time studying the contour maps. I would suggest enough time to be familiar with the major features of the locale, including possible departure routes. 

I have driven my F(ront)WD Hyundai Santa Fe on plenty of logging roads in northern New Hampshire. It is quite possible to get around safely. I even know someone who owns an off-road Toyota Corolla. If you are looking at roads that get graded on a somewhat regular basis, you should be able to drive ok. Stay alert on watch for rocks protruding up and for dips. There may even be small wash outs. If you unsure about the spot ahead, slow down, maybe even get out and scout it on foot. If you aren't confident that your vehicle can handle a section of road, be extra cautious. Getting a tow truck to your location will take way longer than in town. Don't ask how I know ;--) Look for gravel. Think twice (or more) about dirt roads, especially if it has rained or there is rain in the forecast. Gravel holds up well, mud will suck your tires in. If you end up on a narrow section, keep an eye out for places to pull over if you need to either turn around or make room for an approaching vehicle. What kind of activity draws you to unpaved roads? I am an off trail hiker, so if I can't drive in as far as I planned, I am just starting the hike early. 

They sell small electric coolers (e.g., this one by Coleman) that run off of battery power (you can swap out your car battery with a marine battery or get a second battery/solar setup). As you are driving most days, you shouldn't have to worry about the battery running down. Then get yourself a nice two/three burner propane stove (e.g., this one by Coleman), an external propane tank, a wash basin, and a 5 gallon jug of water and you have a pretty nice kitchen (you of course can add an oven). Now you can cook almost anything (keeping ice cream and other frozen foods is more difficult). On all but the hottest weeks you can batch cook and store a couple of days of leftovers in the cooler. I would suggest you never cook at your campsite apart from maybe a small stove to boil water for coffee/tea in the morning and night. Rather, I suggest swinging by the grocery store on the way home, buy what you want and cook it in the store parking lot, eat, and then drive the rest of the way home. 

Somewhat motivated by How to progress in rock climbing after grades v4 / 5.11+? I am curious if anyone has tried to document if there are particular grades that climbers plateau on and need more time to work through. In other words, do many climbers get stuck at V4 an need to work hard to progress and then again at V7, or is it an individual thing that some get stuck at V3, other V4 and some V5? 

Before rubber soles, mountaineers (and others) used hobnailed boots "have been used since antiquity for inexpensive durable footwear". There is a nice note here about Vibram soles replacing hobnailed boots. 

In a lot of ways you pitch a tarp similarly to a tent. Running ground water is an issue for both types of shelters. Many tarp users use bathtub type ground cloths which are essentially the same as tent floors. In heavy rain you want to pitch your shelter in an area with good drainage. Tarps come in all shapes and sizes. The simplest shape is a rectangular tarp. Even the most advanced shapes do not shed wind as well as computer aided designed tents. This means it is more desirable to pitch a tarp in an area protected from the wind. A basic flat tarp has big opening on both ends and smaller openings on the sides. For rainy conditions, you want to pitch the tarp with the sides close to the ground (especially the windward side). You also want to pitch the tarp low to minimize the openings on the ends. Ideally you want to position the tarp so the wind is not blowing through it. You can then further protect yourself by propping your pack on the end. One advantage of a tarp over a tent is it can made of much more waterproof material (e.g., cuben fiber) than typically used in a double walled tent. Further, condensation is less of a problem in a tarp. Finally, with a tarp you do not need to worry about the rain fly sagging and touching the tent and making it less waterproof. 

My compass has become increasingly untrustworthy. Over the past couple years I had noticed that it often pointed pretty close to magnetic South, but it corrected after a light tap. In two recent trips to the woods this compass has been wildly inaccurate. This compass is stored by hanging from my rear-view mirror. Could various electrical devices like the radio and the fan motor degrade the needle? 

When I was in central Alaska, courtesy of Uncle Sam, we wore vapor barrier boots. They are great for extremely low temperatures, but of you are heavily exerting in milder weather* (down to -23C/-10F range), your socks would get downright soggy. Some soldiers did put anti-perspirant on their feet to help with cold and trench foot symptoms. If plastic mountaineering boots don't breathe, anti-perspirant could be helpful. 

Just run. Alligators (and crocodiles) are cold blooded and as a result don't have a lot of stamina. Warm blooded animals can maintain high energy output for longer periods. If you want to aim for something other than 'away from the alligator', go for high ground. That will lessen your chance of ending up in the water where the gator has a better chance of catching you. 

I know nothing about wombats, but I do stalk a particular wild animal here in my part of the world. Here is some general advice. Scat is a good start. Are there areas where it is more concentrated? Get well away from human activity. Wild animals avoid us, some more so than others. I gather that wombats are on the shy side. When you get out there, be quiet. It is difficult for some to fathom just how noisy we are. Move slowly and only move a few steps at a time. Can you hear birds singing in your location? You are starting to blend in. If they are alarming or silent, the wild creatures know that you are around. Rain can be helpful for stalking wild animals in two ways. 1) It makes dead vegetation less crunchy 2) it creates ambient noise that can mask a lot of low level sound. Also consider your scent. How well do wombats smell? You can try to approach an area from down wind. Some hunters do their best to de-scent themselves and their equipment. If they have good vision, you might consider camouflage clothing to give you an edge. 

One complaint about using the Munter hitch for belaying is that it twists and kinks the rope. After doing a full rope length rappel with a Munter hitch down a slightly overhanging face to the base of the climb, what is the best way for a pair of climber to get the twists and kinks out of the climbing rope (you can assume the rope is still hanging from the anchors and the climbers are standing on a wide open and secure area). 

All propane appliances should run off of 5 gallon central propane tank(s). This requires adapters, hoses, and T fittings. You will also want table(s) to set up on. Make sure the table fits in your car and get enough that there is space for everything. Your plans seem a little problematic in that a group of 20 people bringing food individually or in small groups means you need a kitchen for each cooking group. That is a lot of kitchens. Ideally, you would plan a menu and have everyone contribute. Cooking for 20 is difficult, but not impossible. Two groups of 10 would be ideal in my mind. If you really need lots of little groups, you probably want a simpler kitchen and limit what people can bring. Easiest would be for everyone to eat only dehydrated bagged meals. With only 3-5 meals (presumably only 2 dinners) you can just grill the whole time. 

The longer hiking trails in ME, NH, and VT, apart from the AT, like the Long Trail and the Metacomet-Monadnock Trail and Cohos Trail just have too much extreme weather on exposed peaks to be safe for a solo hiker. The New England Scenic Trail in CT and MA could be a possibility since it stays at lower elevations. 

I take public transportation to my work and the climbing gym. This means my climbing gear stays in my office all day with me. My climbing shoes stink and are really offensive to have in my office. When at home I tend to store them in the garage. What is the best way to contain the stench so that my office does not smell like rotting feet? The solution needs to be suitable for being carried on public transportation. In an attempt to mitigate the XY debate, lets assume that I am either unable, unwilling, or unsuccessful at cleaning rock climbing shoes.
