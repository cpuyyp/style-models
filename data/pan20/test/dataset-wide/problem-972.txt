NCERT is an Indian document written from the perspective of the prevailing non-scientific educational culture, in which (for example) astrology is considered to be bona-fide science! Therefore it is not authoritative, and certainly not written accurately from the perspective of peer-reviewed scientific sources. It has been criticized before, and in this case it is quite incorrect to write that transform faults are significantly affected by the Earth's rotation. Rather, the NCERT quotation that you cite seems to confuse the Earth's pole of rotation with the Euler pole of rotation. The latter is a key concept of the plate tectonic movement between any two plates. The Euler pole of rotation can be at any angle with respect to the Earth's rotational axis. 

I don't know much about Scandinavia in the 1500's, and in particular, how much was forested. However, one can say that the whole area was previously glaciated, with much of the topsoil being eroded away by ice, so soils generally tend to be thin, immature, sandy and nutrient poor. We do know that conifers predominated, leaving a soil-litter of pine needles. This latter has a high cation exchange capacity that leads to acid flushes whenever it rains after a long dry period. This acidity tends to leach out nutrients and adds small concentrations of toxic metals. These conditions do not help the soil's fertility. In addition, the valley floors often accumulate peat, hence high organic carbon and acidity. The geology of Scandinavia is complex, and difficult to generalize. Periglacial outwash in Sweden and Denmark would have given rise to some fertile areas, especially where there is limestone to counteract the tendency to acidity. So compared to Russia, Scandinavian soil and agricultural potential is more variable. As regards climate, coastal Norway is much warmer than either eastern Scandinavia and Russia on account of proximity to the Gulf Stream Drift. It also has higher rainfall, so the effective growing season is longer. Northern Scandinavia and Russia have close to 24 hours sunlight per day in high summer, so one wonders whether two growing seasons per year for some crops might be feasible? Are there any agronomists out there who can advise on this question? 

I don't have a definitive answer, but here is a suggestion you might look into: A large bolide will always have a large impact velocity because of the M1 x M2 proportionality of gravitational attraction. A high velocity means that the non-directional dissipation of kinetic energy will far exceed the directional momentum, resulting in a circular or nearly circular crater. A small impactor, on the other hand, may or may not be fast. In the event of a relatively low velocity, the momentum will be relatively large compared to the kinetic energy. Hence, depending upon the angle of impact, it may leave a slightly to very elongated crater. At one extreme, some of the craters in the northern Canadian shield are almost trenches rather than craters. So concentrate on the smaller craters and do a statistical analysis of the crater's eccentricity. If they are nearly all circular then they are probably volcanic; if there is a significant fraction of elliptical craters, especially with high eccentricity, then they are probably of impact origin. Also check for strongly directional patterns of ejecta from the smaller craters. 

Or bacteria could have metabolized silicic acid into insoluble compounds that had less oxygen. This is entirely hypothetical since only a little carborundum has been discovered, and the rest would have had to be subducted. Banded iron formations do though have layers of amorphous quartz. Silicon dioxide was being removed from the water. Perhaps it was alternately iron being removed while soluble siloxanes accumulated in water, and then the siloxanes were converted to silica and removed while iron accumulated in water. It was a complicated web of reactions. Photosynthesis provided the energy to create energy-rich chemicals. Meanwhile every organism that was not photosynthetic was busy finding its best mix of catalyzing chemical reactions that provided energy, versus creating the molecules needed to grow and reproduce. Strange things happened. 

Background First off, there's every reason to think that bacteria already did oxidative phosporylation before there was any free oxygen. It does not require free oxygen, it requires an electron acceptor. O2 provides the most energy, but many other reactants provide some energy, and the bacterial kingdom uses a bewildering variety of them. To use a different electron acceptor requires only one different enzyme -- the rest of the pathway can be the same. So before there was free oxygen, prokaryotes did arbitrage -- they evolved to use the best electron donor/electron acceptor pair they could find under whatever conditions they faced at the moment. And everything they used for that had to be created in a cycle. Anything which they used up that was not replaced, would quickly be gone. Before there was free oxygen, photosynthesis still got done. Some bacteria used H2S as an electron donor, creating S which could later be reduced for energy. Some created H2. Some could reduce CO2 so that they could use the carbon and oxygen to make structures they needed. Some could not, but could still get energy from light. One way to do that was almost the same as oxidative phosphorylation, it used the absorbed light energy for electron transport instead of using redox energy, in practically the same pathway. Cycles. Every reaction must be undone, or its products will increase to the point that the reaction gets very slow. The exception is products that change state. A solid or gas product won't inhibit the reaction much. So, a bewildering variety of electron donors and acceptors. Photosynthesis creates energetic pairs of molecules or ions. Then redox creates less-energetic pairs of molecules or ions. What was it that was bound to oxygen in the old days, that was not bound later? 

Silicon. Silicon is usually oxidized, SiO2. It doesnâ€™t have to have that ratio. Other silicon compounds are possible, eg carborundum SiC, and perryite Fe5Si2 which is stable in acid water, silicon nitride Si3N4, silicon phosphide SiP2 etc . Siloxanes can have ratio Si:O of 1:1. Low molecular weight siloxanes are produced by modern anaerobic biogas fermenters, though it could possibly be eukaryotes producing them. There is potentially a tremendous amount of SiO2 available to release oxygen, although only a little of it is soluble at any one time. 

The question There's a lot of free oxygen now. This oxygen did not suddenly come from underground or from space. So it used to be attached to something. The question is, what was it attached to, and what happened to what it was attached to? 

Break one open. If it is hard (scratches steel), black and vitreous, maybe with a conchoidal fracture, then it is flint, which is very common, especially in southeast England. 

The mountain you see is only a part of the story. From a geological view all mountains have roots, in which the weight of the mountain depresses the upper crust into the lower crust (occasionally with gravity inversion, as in salt diapirs), and the overall crust is depressed into the upper mantle. This results in a regional gravity anomaly which could be regarded as one form of the mountain footprint. That is, a map of the deviation of the mountain's 'Bouguer anomaly', away from the regional gravitational envelope. But that's just a geophysical perspective. You could doubtless develop comparable 'footprint definitions' from a hydrologic or geomorphologic perspective. 

The concept of 'return period' (= 'average recurrence interval', or ARI) is widely used in hydrology, and to a much lesser extent in geology, geomorphology, geophysics, etc. Whatever the application, the traditional analysis is predicated upon 'stationarity of the data-set'. However, in this new era of climate change the hydrologic data set is, by definition, no longer 'stationary'. That is, the underlying statistical parameters are no longer consistent. Therefore, a new methodology is required to take account of the drift in climatic means, extremes, revised frequencies, etc. Are there any first attempts to deal with this problem? 

Even in the exosphere, at 1800 deg centigrade, the only components of the Earth's atmosphere that can currently attain escape velocity are hydrogen (3 kg per sec), and and helium (next to nothing). The notion that the Earth's atmosphere would be stripped away by solar wind but for the protective magnetic shield, is a myth. So there is no 'characteristic time of loss of the Earth's atmosphere' in the sense of slow decay. There is certainty that, as the sun approaches the red giant stage, several billion years from now, there will be catastrophic heating of the atmosphere such that oxygen and nitrogen will be stripped away, leaving Earth to overheat in runaway carbon-dioxide. Unless, that is, if gravitational mayhem, caused by galactic collision with Andromeda, flings Earth substantially further from the sun. Oxygen, nitrogen and inert gasses can escape from bodies the size of the moon, Venus and Mars because the thermal process, 'Jeans Escape', in less massive bodies incurs substantially lower escape velocities. 

It depends upon the hydraulic conductivity, the degree of saturation, and the depth to water table. Generally, water seeping down in the unsaturated zone moves very slowly. Assuming a typical depth to water table of 10 to 20 metres, the seepage time could be a matter of minutes in the case of coarse boulders, to months or even years if there is a lot of clay in fine sediment. Under saturated conditions, the water might move a lot faster. Other factors include the configuration of the wetting front, the unsaturated storage, temperature, and the hydraulic gradient. So basically, there is no simple answer - it's all a matter of the local hydrogeology. There is no substitute for local measurement - water levels in an observation bore, in the case of water table conditions, or tensiometry in the case of the unsaturated zone.
