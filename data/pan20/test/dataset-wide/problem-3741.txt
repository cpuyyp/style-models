Therefore, by the above proposition, one should think of topological spaces as based lattices $(L,A)$ satisfying the above conditions. In fact, from the above result one easily obtains the duality between sober spaces and spatial frames and other dualities. This correspondence between based lattices and closure systems seems to be the most useful when studying closure operators or topologies that are not $T_{1}$. This duality between based lattices and closure systems is very interesting and I have found it to be very useful, but it does not seem to be very well known :(. At last, I should mention that while we would intuitively want topological spaces to satisfy the Hausdorff separation axiom, I would not consider just any Hausdorff space to be geometrically pleasing. It is better to draw the line between the spaces that have a clear geometric or analytic picture and the spaces that do not at complete regularity. All completely regular spaces have a nice geometric picture since they can be embedded into a product $[0,1]^{I}$. The completely regular spaces are precisely the spaces that have a compatible uniform structure. Furthermore, the completely regular spaces are precisely the spaces that have a compatible proximity structure. One would expect a space with a clear intuitive geometric picture to be compatible with extra structure such as a uniformity, a proximity, or even a local proximity (local proximity spaces are completely regular as well). Furthermore, a majority of the interesting topological spaces tend to be completely regular. I have never in practice come across an interesting topological space that is Hausdorff space that is not completely regular other than a couple of counterexamples. In fact, there are many classes of spaces that are automatically completely regular including the locally compact Hausdorff spaces, paracompact spaces, Hausdorff topological groups, uniform spaces and proximity spaces as mentioned before, metric spaces in particular, the order topology and even the lower limit topology on any ordered set, and even CW-complexes. The AMS mathematics subject classification puts the "lower separation axioms" (54D10) from $T_{0}$ to $T_{3}$ and starts the higher separation axioms (54D15) as complete regularity because there is a fundamental difference between spaces that are completely regular and the spaces that are not completely regular. 

Operations on topological spaces which are formed by taking compositions of operations such as union, intersection, complement, and boundary indeed have been studied before. For instance, Kuratowski's Closure Complement Theorem states that if $X$ is a topological space, then there are at most 14 operations on $X$ formed by taking compositions of closure and complementation and this bound is attained in certain topological spaces. Furthermore, if $X$ is a topological space, then there are at most 7 operations on $X$ formed by taking the composition of interior and closure. These 7 operations take the set $A$ to the following sets: $A,\textrm{Int}(A),\textrm{Cl}(A),\textrm{Int}(\textrm{Cl}(A)),\textrm{Cl}(\textrm{Int}(A)),\textrm{Int}(\textrm{Cl}(\textrm{Int}(A))),\textrm{Cl}(\textrm{Int}(\textrm{Cl}(A)))$. The fact that there are no more than these 7 operations follows from the fact that taking interior and taking the closure are idempotent operations, and that we do not get anything new when we alternate between interior and closure too many times. The 14 operations in Kuratowski's Closure Complement Theorem come from the seven operations listed above and their complements. Things get more complicated when we introduce new operations such as union and intersection however. There is a topological space $X$ and a subset $A\subseteq X$ such that infinitely many sets can be formed from $A$ simply by taking compositions of unions, intersections, complements, interior, and closure. Therefore, since there are many operations on topological spaces formed by taking the composition of operations such as union, complementation, and closure, it seems like it would be a futile task to give too many of these operations special names, but these operations formed by composing union, complementation, and closure do form an algebraic structure called a closure algebra. A closure algebra is a Boolean algebra $B$ along with a unary operation $C$ satisfying the identities $x\leq C(x)=C(C(x))$ and $C(x\vee y)=C(x)\vee C(y)$. The operations union, intersection, complementation, and closure on a topological space $X$ make the powerset $P(X)$ into an algebraic structure called a closure algebra. Furthermore, every closure algebra can be embedded into the closure algebra determined by a topological space. Thus, the operations on a topological space formed by taking union, complementations, closure. . . are in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements in a free closure algebra. Furthermore, the equational theory of the variety of closure algebras is decidable, so there is some algorithm to determine whether two of these operations on a topological space are the same operation or not. 

The notions of algebraic independence (as in linear independence) and probabilistic independence are both captured in the notions of an independent subset of a Boolean algebra and the notion of an independent family of partitions. Suppose that $B$ is a Boolean algebra. Then a subset $R\subseteq B$ is said to be independent if $R$ freely generates a subalgebra of $B$. Then $R$ is independent if and only if whenever $r_{1},...,r_{n}\in R$ are distinct elements and for all $i$ either $s_{i}=r_{i}$ or $s_{i}=r_{i}'$ we have $s_{1}\wedge...\wedge s_{n}\neq 0$. Recall that a subset $p$ of a Boolean algebra $B$ is a partition if $0\not\in p$, $\bigvee p=1$ and where $a\wedge b=0$ whenever $a,b\in p,a\neq b$. A collection of partitions $\mathcal{P}$ of $B$ is said to be independent if whenever $p_{1},...,p_{n}\in\mathcal{P}$ and $a_{1}\in p_{1},...,a_{n}\in p_{n}$ then $a_{1}\wedge...\wedge a_{n}\neq 0$. This notion of independence in a Boolean algebra can be thought of as both an algebraic independence and a probabilistic independence. For example, if $R_{1},...,R_{n}$ are events in a probability space with $P(R_{i})\in(0,1)$ for $1\leq i\leq n$ and $R_{1},...,R_{n}$ are independent in the probabilistic sense, then $R_{1},...,R_{n}$ are independent in a Boolean algebraic sense. The main result about independence in Boolean algebras is the result by Balcar and Franek which states that every infinite complete Boolean algebra $B$ has an independent subset $R\subseteq B$ with $|R|\subseteq|B|$ and hence a free subalgebra $A\subseteq B$ with $|A|=|B|$. One corollary of this result is that if $A,B$ are complete Boolean algebras with $|A|\leq|B|$, then there is a surjective Boolean algebra homomorphism $\phi:B\rightarrow A$. Furthermore, Balcar and Franek go on to show that complete Boolean algebras have not just large free algebras, but they also have large independent sets of large partitions in the following sense. Suppose that $B$ is a Boolean algebra. Recall that the saturation $Sat(B)$ of $B$ is the least cardinal such that every partition of $B$ has cardinality less than $Sat(B)$. Then $B$ is said to be well-semifree if there is an independent family $\mathcal{P}$ of partitions such that if $\lambda<Sat(B)$, then $\{p\in\mathcal{P}:|p|=\lambda\}=Sat(B)$. A Boolean algebra $B$ is said to be saturation homogeneous if whenever $B\simeq A\times C$ and $|A|>1$ then $Sat(A)=Sat(B)$. 

Since my comment on point-free topology was upvoted, let me give a better description of what anti-compactness means in point-free topology and why this notion corresponds to the notion of the cardinality of a topological space. The anti-compactness number in a topological space $X$ is the smallest cardinal $\lambda$ such that every closed cover of $X$ has a subcover of cardinality less than $\lambda$. Clearly the anti-compactness number of a $T_{1}$ space $X$ is $|X|^{+}$, so the anti-compactness number measures the cardinality of $T_{1}$-spaces. In this answer, I shall generalize the notion of the anti-compactness number to point-free topology. The reader is encouraged to read Picado and Pultr's book Frames and Locales: Topology Without Points for more thorough explanations. Suppose that $L$ is a frame. Then a subset $S\subseteq L$ is a sublocale if $S$ is closed under arbitrary meets and whenever $l\in L$ and $s\in S$, then $l\rightarrow s\in S$ as well. The notion of a sublocale is a point-free analogue of the notion of a subspace of a topological space. There are several different characterizations of the notion of a sublocale. It should be also noted that the sublocales are in a one-to-one correspondence with the congruences on a frame. The collection of all sublocales of a frame is a co-frame under the inclusion ordering. In particular, the collection of all sublocales of a frame is a complete lattice. In this complete lattice, the greatest lower bound of sublocales is simply the intersection of sublocales, and the least upper bound of sublocales is given by the following simple formula: $$\bigvee_{i\in I}S_{i}=\{\bigwedge R|R\subseteq\bigcup_{i\in I}S_{i}\}.$$ If $L$ is a frame and $a\in L$, then the set $\uparrow a=\{y\in L|y\geq a\}$ is a sublocale of $L$. The sublocales of the form $\uparrow a$ are called closed sublocales. There is also a notion of an open sublocale of a frame. It should be noted that the greatest lower bound of sublocales does not correspond very well with the intersection of sets. The greatest lower bound of all dense open sublocales of a frame is a dense sublocale since every frame has a smallest dense sublocale. However, the intersection of all dense open subspaces of a topological space with no isolated points is the empty set. On the other hand, the least upper bound of sublocales of a frame corresponds quite nicely to the union of subsets of a set. If $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a topological space and $R\subseteq X$, then define an equivalence relation $E_{R}$ on $\mathcal{T}$ by letting $(U,V)\in E_{R}$ iff $U,V\in\mathcal{T}$ and $U\cap R=V\cap R$. Then each $E_{R}$ is a congruence on $\mathcal{T}$. Let $\widetilde{R}$ be the collection of all maximum elements from each equivalence class in $E_{R}$. Then $\widetilde{R}$ is the sublocale of $\mathcal{T}$ that corresponds to the subspace $R$ and $E_{R}$ is the congruence on the frame $\mathcal{T}$ that corresponds to the subspace $R$. Furthermore, if $R_{i}\subseteq X$ for $i\in I$, then $$\widetilde{\bigcup_{i\in I}R_{i}}=\bigvee_{i\in I}\widetilde{R_{i}}$$ (here the least upper bound is taken in the lattice of sublocales of $\mathcal{T}$), and $$E_{\bigcup_{i\in I}R_{i}}=\bigcap_{i\in I}E_{R_{i}}.$$ We define the anti-compactness number of a frame $L$ to be the least cardinal $\lambda$ such that whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is a collection of closed sublocales of $L$ with $\bigvee\mathcal{C}=1$, then there is some $\mathcal{D}\subseteq\mathcal{C}$ with $|\mathcal{D}|<\lambda$ and $\bigvee\mathcal{D}=1$. If $(X,\mathcal{T})$ is a $T_{1}$-space, then the anti-compactness number of the frame $\mathcal{T}$ is $|X|^{+}$. Therefore the anti-compactness number of a frame truly measures the cardinality of the corresponding topological space. Also, the anti-compactness number of a complete Boolean algebra is its saturation (as defined in the Handbook of Boolean Algebras). I have not found anything published that has attempted to generalize the notion of the cardinality of a space to point-free topology, and there may be similar ways or even better ways to generalize the notion of the cardinality to point-free topology (in fact, sometimes concepts in general topology generalize to point free topology in several natural ways). On the other hand, unlike cardinality, most other well known notions from general topology have been generalized quite nicely and easily to point-free topology. I will probably come back later and add more detail to this answer. Perhaps, I should write a paper on this issue. 

$DM(X)$ is a completely distributive lattice whenever $I$ is a set, $x\in X$, $R_{i}\subseteq X$, and $\bigvee^{X}R_{i}=x$ for $i\in I$, then there is some $S$ with $S\preceq R_{i}$. for each $x\in X$, there is a smallest downwards closed subset $L\subseteq X$ with $\bigvee L=x$. 

then whenever $A\models\phi(f_{1},...,f_{n})$, then $A_{x}\models\phi(f_{1}(x),...,f_{n}(x))$ for each $x\in X$. Is there a characterization of the formulas closed under taking Boolean product stalks? Are the formulas closed under taking Boolean product stalks precisely the formulas closed under taking reduced factors? $\textbf{Background}$ A formula of the form $A_{1}\wedge...\wedge A_{n}\rightarrow B$ or of the form $(\neg A_{1})\vee...\vee(\neg A_{n})$ where $A_{1},...,A_{n},B$ are atomic is said to be a basic Horn formula. A formula of the form $Q_{1}x_{1}...Q_{n}x_{n}(\phi_{1}\wedge...\wedge\phi_{n})$ where $Q_{1},...,Q_{n}$ are quantifiers and $\phi_{1},...,\phi_{n}$ are basic horn formulae is said to be a Horn formula. It is a standard result that a formula is equivalent to a Horn formula if and only if whenever $A_{i}\models\phi(a_{1,i},...,a_{n,i})$ for $i\in I$ and $Z$ is a filter on $I$, then $\prod_{i\in I}A_{i}/Z\models\phi([(a_{1,i})_{i\in I}],...,[(a_{n,i})_{i\in I}])$. It is an exercise in Chang and Keisler that every positive sentence is preserved under taking reduced factors, but not every sentence preserved under reduced factors is a positive sentence. 

Let $A$ be a finite set, and suppose $0\in A$. For each $a\in A\setminus\{0\}$, let $w_{a}$ be a positive integer called the weight of $a$, and let $w_{0}=0$. Give $A$ the discrete topology and $A^{\mathbb{Z}}$ the product topology. We say that a mapping $\phi:A^{\mathbb{Z}}\rightarrow A^{\mathbb{Z}}$ is a one-dimensional cellular automaton if $\phi$ is continuous and if $\phi\tau=\tau\phi$ where $\tau(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}=(x_{n-1})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ is the shift map. Let $\Sigma(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}=\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}w_{x_{n}}$. We say that $\phi$ is conservative for the weights $(w_{a})_{a\in A}$ if $\Sigma(\mathbb{x})=\Sigma(\phi(\mathbb{x}))$ for all $\mathbb{x}\in\mathbb{A}^{\mathbb{Z}}$. Suppose that $f,g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ are strictly increasing and nowhere zero. Then we say that $f\simeq g$ if there are $r,s$ where $f(n)\leq r\cdot g(rn)$ and $g(n)\leq s\cdot f(sn)$ for all $n$. Suppose now that $\Sigma(\mathbb{x})<\infty$. Then define the width $W(\mathbb{x})=\max(\{m-n|x_{m}\neq 0,y_{n}\neq 0\})$. Let $G(\phi,\mathbb{x}):\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ be defined by $G(\phi,\mathbb{x})(n)=W(\phi^{n}(\mathbb{x}))$. Easier question: Let $f_{r}:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ be the function where $f_{r}(n)=\lfloor 1+n^{r}\rfloor$. Are the real numbers $r\in[0,1]$ such that $f_{r}\simeq G(\phi,\mathbb{x})$ for some conservative $\phi$ and $\mathbb{x}$ with $\Sigma(\mathbb{x})<\infty$ precisely the rational numbers? What if we required each $\phi$ to also be reversible. Harder question: Is there a characterization of the set of all functions $f$ where $f\simeq G(\phi,\mathbb{x})$ for some $\phi$ which is conservative with respect to some system of weights and $\mathbb{x}$? What if each $\phi$ were also required to be reversible? 

Simply take the ordinals $\omega+1,...,\omega+n$ and one obtains $n!$ distinct products (This solution was taken from Chapter 8 Problem 39 and Chapter 9 Problem 66 in the book Problems and Theorems is Classical Set Theory). This follows from the easily provable fact that for natural numbers $r_{1},...,r_{n}$ we have $$(\omega+r_{1})\cdots(\omega+r_{n})=\omega^{n}+\omega^{n-1}r_{n}+\omega^{n-2}r_{n-1}+...+\omega r_{2}+r_{1}.$$ 

I claim that for each cardinal $\lambda$, there is a connected space $C$ and $c_{0},c_{1}\in C$ such that whenever $|X|<\lambda$, then $X$ is connected if and only if for all $x,y\in X$ there is some continuous map $f:C\rightarrow X$ with $f(c_{0})=x$ and $f(c_{1})=y$. Let $I$ be an index set and let $(X_{i},x_{i},y_{i})_{i\in I}$ be an enumeration of all the connected spaces with two points of cardinality less than $\lambda$ up to an isomorphism preserving the $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$. Let $C=\prod_{i\in I}X_{i}$, let $c_{0}=(x_{i})_{i\in I}$, and let $c_{1}=(y_{i})_{i\in I}$. Then $C$ is connected. Therefore if $X$ is a space and for each $x,y\in X$ there is some $f:C\rightarrow X$ with $f(c_{0})=x,f(c_{1})=y$, then $X$ is connected. On the other hand, if $X$ is connected, $|X|<\lambda$ and $x,y\in X$, then $(X,x,y)\simeq(X_{i},x_{i},y_{i})$ for some $i\in I$. However, the projection onto the $i$-th coordinate $\pi_{i}:C\rightarrow X_{i}$ is a continuous mapping with $\pi_{i}(c_{0})=x_{i},\pi_{i}(c_{1})=y_{i}$. 

Real world applications of large cardinals The goal of this proposed project is to use large cardinals to prove a result in an applied area or at least a “down-to-Earth” area of mathematics such that the large cardinal hypotheses cannot be removed. Motivation Large cardinals are able to prove results about finite and countable structures which cannot be proven otherwise. For example, all large cardinals prove the purely combinatorial statement $\textrm{Con}(\mathrm{ZFC})$ and even $\textrm{Con}(\mathrm{ZFC}+\mathbf{S})$ whenever $\mathbf{S}$ is a weaker large cardinal axiom. One should therefore expect for large cardinals to also prove finitistic purely combinatorial statements which are independent of ZFC but which are of interest to mathematicians such as finite group theorists or finite combinatorialists. Unfortunately, large cardinals have not yet found their way into these down-to-Earth subjects. Rank-into-rank embeddings At this point in time, the large cardinals around the rank-into-rank level seem to have the most potential for real-world applications due to the intricate algebraic structure of rank-into-rank embeddings. We shall therefore limit the scope of this project to algebraic structure of the large cardinals around the rank-into-rank level. Let $\lambda$ be a cardinal and let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ denote the set of all elementary embeddings from $V_{\lambda}$ to $V_{\lambda}$. The elementary embeddings in $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ are known as rank-into-rank embeddings. If there is a non-trivial elementary embedding in $j\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$, then $\lambda$ is an extremely large strong limit cardinal of countable cofinality. Define an operation $*$ on $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ by letting $j*k=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}j(k|_{V_{\alpha}})$. 

Suppose that $\lambda$ is a cardinal. Let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ be the set of all elementary embeddings from $V_{\lambda}$ to $V_{\lambda}$. If $j,k\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$, then define $j[k]=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}j(k|_{V_{\alpha}})$. Suppose that $j_{1},...,j_{n}\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$. Let $\langle j_{1},...,j_{n}\rangle$ denote the smallest subset of $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ that contains $\{j_{1},...,j_{n}\}$ and is closed under the operation $(j,k)\mapsto j[k]$. Let $K=\{\mathrm{crit}(j)|j\in\langle j_{1},...,j_{n}\rangle\}$. 

Large cardinals such as weakly compact cardinals, measurable cardinals, strongly compact cardinals, and extendible cardinals all can be characterized in terms of a certain compactness theorem of certain strength. For instance, weakly compact cardinals are precisely the cardinals $\kappa$ where the $\kappa$-compactness theorem holds in $L_{\kappa,\kappa}$ when we bound the number of non-logical symbols by $\kappa$. Strongly compact cardinals are precisely the cardinals where the $\kappa$-compactness theorem holds for $L_{\kappa,\kappa}$. Extendible cardinals are the cardinals where the compactness theorem holds for higher order infinitary logic. Furthermore, there are characterizations of at least weakly compact, measurable, and strongly compact cardinals involving different forms of compactness besides logical compactness. Is there is a characterization of supercompact cardinals in terms of some sort of compactness theorem? Can any other large cardinal axioms besides the ones already mentioned be characterized in terms of some sort of compactness theorem?
