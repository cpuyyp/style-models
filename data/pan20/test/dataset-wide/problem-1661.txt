It isn't "stalling" but it is improving more slowly than the trend up to 2010. There is some wiggle room in the word "stalling" that makes it a hard claim to be precise about. But showing the actual figures can help clarify the situation. Newspaper headlines and speculation about the possible causes of the "stall" have not usually contributed much clarity. The BMJ however had a useful article earlier in 2017 which showed this chart which compares mortality to the level in 2001: 

The situation for the mechanism of action of one of modern medicines oldest drugs remains a mystery despite them being in routine use for a century and a half. 

Pauling believed that large doses of vitamin C could achieve many health benefits and he was powerful and persuasive advocate of his theories. But his persuasiveness didn't sway the scientific consensus. One early (1976) review of the idea that the vitamin protects against the common cold reported this: 

A recent article in arstechnica reports that there is a large flow of funding from some conservative groups to a network of climate denying think tanks and lobbyists. The article Reports how work by Robert Brulle (my emphasis): 

In a recent paper in Environmental Science and Technology, Kharecha and Hansen argue that, by avoiding the airborne pollution that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning, millions of lives have been saved. In their words: 

There are a number of contentious criticisms of climate science and some highly debatable claims about causality (is it all about the sun?). And I can't think of an easy way to verify Roman temperatures that wouldn't be controversial. But the claim that Alpine glaciers were much smaller is surely a matter of history and should be verifiable from historical sources. So, is his claim that they were much smaller in Roman times correct? 

If this count is credible, it appears that whether you count incidents the "home-grown" right wingers have caused more terrorism in the USA than Islamic extremist inspired terrorists (though the number of deaths is similar). They do, however, caveat this claim with the following: 

(somebody had to ask this) Micheal Douglas, who was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010, said in a recent interview with the Guardian: 

Since lead piping has mostly been eliminated, this effects is no longer likley to have any significance. So the direct evidence seems to suggest that hard water is (very slightly) good for you. I have not yet found more recent research results on the topic so it would be interesting to see whether similar studies from other countries or more recent studies show the same effect. 

Give that other estimates of milk consumption suggest that raw mile is <1% of total volume, this suggests it is between 50 and 100 times riskier. Edit april 2014 Visual.ly has compiled a useful infographic on the statistics on raw milk. It is big but useful: 

Better quality and cheaper care: is this true? Update In a recent (2018) article on infighting among Trump officials running the VHA, The Economist reports an explanation of why many Americans find it so hard to believe the VHA does a good job (counter to the widespread belief in the USA that "socialised" medicine is always bad). My emphasis: 

So there are plenty of known reasons why bad results get published and there are a lot of them. But it is something that good scientists can fight. 

Their methodology has been criticised before, is this estimate any better than the others? PS I've updated the title to match the latest claim. However, all the claims are based on the same analysis so a good answer should address all of the different versions Oxfam have presented over time. 

I received it most recently in a tweet from @Amazing_Maps. I have reason to doubt it, or at least the definition of invasion. In several of the European examples Britain was a liberating power not staging a takeover (as much of the comment implies). Lots of European countries were "invaded" by coalitions involving Britain during the Napoleonic wars and the two world wars (as were countries on other continents). And when was the last time we invaded Finland? So is it accurate on a strict definition of invasion (colonial takeovers, for example) or even on any looser definition? 

New York has filed a lawsuit against several Big Oil firms on the grounds that they fomented contrarian opinion to undermine some findings in climate science. In one part of the suit they claim the following (paragraph 86, my emphasis): 

The simple answer is: no they don't Andrew Gelman has addressed this issue several times in his blog and his book Red State, Blue State, also has a lot of related electoral statistics. In responding to statements like this (in William Saletan's review of Jonathan Haidt's book, The Righteous Mind), my emphasis : 

Ben Goldacre, in his sustained critique of the way the pharmaceutical industry and its regulators fall far from the standards of reliable evidence (Bad Pharma), makes an astounding claim (p193 of the paperback, my emphasis): 

The source for some of these numbers is a WHO publication Fuel for life: household energy and health (full text as pdf here). A simple summary would be that most of the damage from burning wood occurs when done in poorly ventilated indoor environments. Standing around an open air bonfire is probably not a big risk in comparison. 

This goes some way to explaining the difference between evidence and perception about screening. More relevant to this answer, the article quotes Sir Muir Gray (Chief Knowledge Officer of the NHS): 

One factor common to both experiments was that the buyers were not patients but other professionals (often medics) who were well equipped to judge the quality and effectiveness of the clinical care on offer. This goes a long way to making Kenneth Arrow's objection to healthcare competition irrelevant: patients may be ill-equipped to judge the quality or effectiveness of treatment when faced with a doctor or hospital who is, but the actual purchasers are not. The NHS is also distinct from many other health systems in that the patients do not pay either directly or via competing insurers: the Government acts as the universal insurer for the population. The evidence so far suggests that well-designed competition can save lives and lower costs The results from the first experiment in the NHS were mixed. Carol Propper summarises in this review (which also contains many references to other analysis, some from the US market so is a useful source for further reading and more detailed evidence): 

There is no evidence that synthetic chemicals are more harmful than those produced by nature One of the problems with the debate about whether artificial chemicals (which could mean novel compounds or naturally occurring compounds synthesised by laboratory or industrial processes) are carcinogens is that the tests on artificial chemicals are rarely seen in context. Bruce Ames summarises the issue well in the abstract of one of his papers (my emphasis): 

There are two projections being made here. Period life expectancy uses current mortality in its estimate; Cohort life expectancy uses projected future mortality changes (so it is the one to compare to the question's claims). For the UK the latest numbers are shown in the ONS chart below (with three scenarios based on uncertainty in the future mortality numbers): 

A recent carefully conducted study clearly says there is no relationship Fabian's answer addresses the consensus and the problems with the reported methods (or their lack) of the Chinese studies quoted by the anti-fluoride movement. But a recently reported and carefully conducted study from New Zealand specifically studies the reported link between intake of fluoride and intelligence and concludes there is no link at all. From the pubmed abstract (my emphasis): 

but in a recent opinion piece, British GP Iona Heath suggests that we are currently overtreating low risk patients and actually making their health worse: 

So thats a fairly muted positive for micro finance. It isn't a miracle, but it seems to be better than nothing. The topic is a lot bigger than can easily be summarised. It is worth reading Banerjee and Duflo's book on the subject, Poor Economics to get a broader overview. 

While the consensus is that CFCs cause the ozone hole, there is recent evidence that we don't understand it as well as we thought When I first read the Rutan comments I though he had simply gone nuts in his general skeptical approach to scares (on Skeptics.se we should applaud his skeptical approach unless his evidence is nonsense), but then I uncovered some recent science that might give some grounds for his claim (though not the degree of certainty he expresses). As far as I can tell the original source is from a Nature news story in 2007 which points out that some recent reevaluations of the reaction kinetics of some of the key reactions involved in ozone depletion had given radically different results to those used in the original models of ozone depletion. As one of the scientists reviewing the results said: 

This article in The Register claims that PokÃ©mon Go may have a bad side effect on road safety. The headline is: 

The authors are more skeptical than many previous studies, but not entirely dismissive of some small link. But they are clear that other factors matter far more and that focussing on climate as a factor is distracting as other actions can have a far larger influence on what happens that anything that can be done about climate. 

A recent study about the effect of artificial sweeteners suggests they may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This has been widely reported in the media, for example the Mail Online claims: 

The result comes from about 75 trials with good designs that reported all cause mortality selected from nearly 600 with bias, poor design or inadequate reporting of the mortality. The studies covered: 

Short answer: no. Long answer: it depends on definitions but on most sensible definitions still no. I'm summarising the excellent analysis by UK fact checkers Full Fact as presented here. This analysis primarily relates to the UK (where the debate about EU influence is probably more contentious than anywhere else) but the key issues apply in other countries as well. The core problem in getting to any meaningful answer is how and what counts as a law. If we just count acts of parliament then major bills (like the 500 page Health and Social Care act which completely reformed the NHS) count equally with the three page act clarifying the rules on VAT fraud. But acts of parliament are not the only things that count as law: 

So my question is are any of the concerns significant in the light of real evidence? I deliberately use the word significant because small effects don't seem to me to make a compelling argument against the policy. Another factor that good answers should address is the relationship between the policy and actual behaviour on the roads (only about half of all drivers in the UK stick to the current limit). I've also deliberately kept the question narrowly focussed on motorways which are by far the safest roads in most countries. What happens on other road types is not my concern. 

Healthcare is getting more expensive in most western countries. It is widely assumed that one of the major factors behind this is the ageing of populations (baby boomers produced in the burst of high birth rates in the 1950s and '60s are now retiring but fewer children are being born). For example, this analysis in the Guardian states: 

On a more positive note the article recommends a number of ways to de-bias scientific answers. Some of these are summarised in the picture below: 

Big projects (software, engineering, architecture etc.) are plagued by cost and time overruns, or so it is widely thought. Nicholas Taleb argues in Antifragile that this is a modern phenomenon: 

The source is this American Journal of Clinical Nutrition paper. Given the notorious unreliability of nutritional studies and the complexity of models adjusting for other risk factors, is this result credible or significant? And is it consistent with other studies?
