Given that the Laws explicitly allow square or rectangular posts, I don't think you're going to be able to make an argument that they are disallowed just because you think they're dangerous. 

If it happens that the Eagles win Super Bowl LII, then every team in the NFC East will also have won a championship. 

Based on the stats from the 2013 World Games final, I'm not seeing any evidence that high-level korfball players 

I don't think you looked very hard ;-) A simple Google for "cricket hat trick run outs" led to this rec.sport.cricket thread and the Ireland vs Netherlands match in the 2011 World Cup which had four run outs in consecutive balls in the last four balls of the innings: 

However, if the non-striker hitting the stumps was "wilful", he would be out for obstructing the field (Law 37): 

The closest examples I can think of to tennis, where the same rules apply across significantly different surfaces are soccer, American football and baseball, all of which can be played on both natural and artificial turf. Taking a slightly wider definition of "one sport", there are some more examples: 

The answer is Ligue 1. As you point out, this isn't necessarily justified on the basis of results in European competitions. There are a couple of other factors which weigh into this discussion though: 

(my emphasis) However, some other fouls do not result in an automatic first down. For example, an illegal punt formation by the defense (Rule 9, Section 1, Article 3, Item 2) results in: 

To a large extent, "positions" aren't defined in the NFL - there's nothing that says that only "a quarterback" can do stuff which a quarterback normally does. If the Patriots wanted Edelman to throw a pass, they can do that, whether that be for one play or the rest of the game. They could equally do this with a running back, a cornerback or any other player, and they can do it no matter if the "regular" quarterbacks are injured or not. The only slight complication here is that players are assigned numbers based on their position, and certain numbers (50-79) are reserved for offensive linemen who are not eligible to catch a pass. However, any ineligible player can make themselves "eligible" for one play by reporting to the referee, so if a team really wanted to put an offensive lineman in at quarterback, they'd simply have to report in before every play (the quarterback is an eligible receiver, even if they're not normally going to catch a pass). 

So in this circumstance, the batsmen completed one (and only one) run before the wicket was put down; therefore the batting team scores one run and the scores are equal. We now refer to Law 21.5: 

Lord's slope is a historical anomaly - it's been there since the ground moved to its current location in 1814. Nobody would build a cricket ground with that kind of slope these days, and if they did, nobody would let Test cricket be played there. But Lord's is Lord's. It's "the home of cricket" and it's impossible to change now. 

"Assists" in football are a (relatively) modern statistic and weren't collected in Maradona's playing days. Unless anyone has been through recordings of every international match Maradona played (assuming that video exists of them all, which is by no means guaranteed), this statistic isn't going to be available. 

The question is "whose fault is it"? Wides are considered to be the bowler's fault, and are scored as runs conceded by the bowler. On the other hand, byes are considered to be the wicket-keeper's fault and not scored as runs conceded by the bowler. The typical case for 5 wides is a ball either so wide or so high that the keeper doesn't have a reasonable chance to stop it, so it's reasonable that these are debited to the bowler. 

I don't believe either of the answers posted to be entirely correct. The crucial point is that in your scenario, both batsmen 

However, it's clearly not the intent of this law to be applied to players who were signing autographs at the boundary between balls, even if they didn't quite make it back onto the field by the time the ball was bowled. So I think the simple answer here is: nothing happens. 

There is no special case for being "caught behind" or "caught by the wicket keeper", so the rule is the same as at any other time: if the batsmen had crossed at the moment the catch was taken, then the former non-striker takes strike. If the batsmen had not crossed, then the new batsman takes strike. Specifically, see Law 18.12(a): 

It all depends on how you measure stuff. It's generally accepted that MLB's current tracking system (PITCHf/x) is the most accurate system available, and Chapman holds the record for a PITCHf/x measured pitch with his 105 mph pitch on 2010-09-24 for the Reds vs the Padres. Various people have attempted to translate older measurements into the same standards as used by PITCHf/x, notably the fact that PITCHf/x measures the speed of the pitch 50 feet from home plate. For example, eFastball estimate that Ryan's pitch on 1974-20-08, which was measured at 100.9 mph at a point 10 feet from home plate would have been travelling at 108.1 mph at the PITCHf/x measurement point of 50 feet from home plate, and thus is faster than Chapman's pitch. But this is an estimate, not a measurement so should be taken with a (small) grain of salt. 

The ball is still in play until it touches the ground or a permanent fixture, so the player has to get out of the way, just as they would for any other ball going out. 

Yes. Oscar Pistorius is by far the most famous example, competing in the men's 400m at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Other examples are Natalia Partyka who competed in the women's table tennis at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, and Natalie du Toit who competed in the women's 10 km swimming race at the 2008 Summer Olympics. 

Why does anyone ever argue with a umpire/referee at all? Certainly no official at the professional level is ever going to change their mind because somebody shouted at them. That leaves two possibilities: 

(my emphasis). Coaches are essentially not referred to at all in either the Laws or ICC Playing Conditions. 

A stumping generally happens when the bowler has deceived the batsman with some combination of length, speed and/or spin and has enticed him to come out of his ground to play a shot - as such, it involves an amount of skill on the part of the bowler so they are credited with the wicket. A run out means that the batsman has hit the ball and decided to run, but for whatever reason there wasn't actually a run there. The skill here comes from the fielders and whoever breaks the wicket, and no significant input from the bowler - as such, they're not credited with a wicket. 

Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. Talk to an actual lawyer trained in the jurisdiction you care about if this is important to you. This is going to vary a bit between legal jurisdictions, but in England and Wales the fact that both parties have consented to the fight is important. There are limits to this (R vs Brown is the most notable case; the details are somewhat graphic so be warned before clicking that link), but an organised boxing match, properly sanctioned and with appropriate controls (e.g. a referee who will stop the fight if necessary, medical support available) is legal. A bare knuckle fight on the street will be treated differently and may be an offence even if both parties have consented. 

For the Tour de France, a rider has to finish within a set percentage of the time of the stage winner. This factor depends on two things: 

The article goes on to note that the Globetrotters did win the World Professional Basketball Tournament in 1940; perhaps that is the story which has been confused with what you heard? 

A wide is always a wide, and always gives one run to the batting team. It doesn't matter if the batsman was out from the ball, whether that be run out, stumped or any of the other ways a batsman can be out from a wide. This is explicitly covered in Law 25.5: 

The batsman isn't necessarily marking off-stump - they're marking their own individual preferred position. Some players will "take guard" on leg stump, others further across towards off stump. Two other obvious issues: 

No. As soon as the fielder was simultaneously in contact with both the ball and the boundary rope, the boundary is scored and the ball is dead. See Law 23.1: 

Your question is based on a false premise: China does have a cricket team which is affiliated with the ICC and has competed in various tournaments. 

We now apply criterion (e), which says to repeat steps (a) to (d) only on the matches involving teams A and B. A is declared the winner as they beat team B. Note that if the A - C result had instead been 0 - 1, team B would have been the winner as they would have scored more goals in the matches involving teams A, B and C. 

Given the age of particularly the first of those goals, I suspect we'll never know which was scored earlier in the match. 

The advantages of a nice comfy seat over a thin bit of plastic or a wooden plank are fairly obvious: 

Having looked through Wikipedia, I can find two goals which were scored in the 4th minute of one of a number of simultaneous opening matches: 

(my emphasis). Exactly the same section in the current Test Match playing conditions answers your question: 

I don't know of examples where players have been cautioned for wild tackles against their own team, but players fighting members of their own team and getting sent off isn't that uncommon. One of the most famous examples is probably Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer in 2005, but your favourite search engine will find you a lot more. 

The Laws of Cricket aren't always great at defining what certain terms used within the Laws mean, and I think "crossed" is one of those cases. However, we can use the definition in Law 30.2 which does clearly define which ground belongs to which batsman: 

I don't believe there is a more specific term than "javelin thrower". Certainly that's what Wikipedia uses to describe eg Jan Železný: 

Reading between the lines, I would interpret "my growth as a player" as "chance to win a championship". 

If the player receives a second yellow card while he is leaving the field, he is still the "active" player and is sent off. Sent off players cannot be replaced, so the substitution cannot happen. A very similar situation happens in this video where the player leaving the field receives a second yellow card for removing his shirt. 

The simple answer is "in a database". Assuming you've done the hard work of getting it all into the database in an appropriate form, it will be as simple as (in psuedo SQL): 

Assuming that in the fourth instance the errors were not all committed by one player (which is implied by the various reports on Tommy John's play), this would leave Tommy John as the holder of this dubious record. 

Anything else would be very unfair to the bowling side, who will have stopped chasing the ball at the moment the umpire gave the original "out" decision. If you're interested in a different form of the game, you'll obviously need to read the playing conditions for that format. The ODI playing conditions contain exactly the same wording in Appendix 3, and DRS is not currently used for T20Is. 

The answer here is going to depend a lot on how you define "World Championship" and "team" (in particular, is one person a team?), so here's a community wiki list: 

Yes, the ball is in play - but it was in play before the goalkeeper put it on the ground as well. Quoting Law 9, The Ball In and Out of Play: 

So as of right now (2nd January 2015) he is a Chelsea player, but he will be an AC Milan player from 5th January. 

Also, be very, very careful about anything your brother does with a professional team in Europe. The NCAA's requirements around amateur status are incredibly strict, and if you violate those requirements then you're never going to play NCAA basketball, no matter how good you are. Finally the reality check: be prepared to accept that your brother probably isn't going to make it. Getting a college scholarship is very hard for US high school players, and even harder for Europeans. 

That's a model rather than empirical data based on actual games, but certainly gives us some sort of idea as to a success rate. 

The only question that matters here is what the regulations say for the competition(s) you're going to be entering. If your bike meets the regulations and you can complete the distance on it, then that's all that's essential to complete the race. 

In the diagram you've drawn, this would result in losing the point; the ball has passed entirely to the other side of the net through the crossing space so your team is no longer allowed to play the ball; quoting from Rule 9 of the 2015-2016 Rules of the Game: 

and the indigenous people of Australia (Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders) form an All Stars rugby league team which plays an annual match against the NRL All Stars. 

The official rules of darts don't make this particularly clear as far as I can tell, but the situation is that reducing your required score to one is the same as going over the required score and the "Bust" rule applies, namely: 

Without any real evidence, my guess here is that this is just to cut down the number of interruptions in the game. Imagine the situation: 

This is out of a total of 2302 Tests matches played to date, so that means that about 0.13% of all Test matches have been won by the team following on. 

However, it seems unlikely to me that Foo would not have been drafted as he was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award. How does a good player get to be a "college free agent" and apparently choose which team to play for? (Feel free to use Foo for specifics in the answer, but interested in the general case). 

From the sound of it, the middle blocker's action was not an attempt to intercept the ball, but instead a separate attempt to spike the ball, so it should not be counted as a block and team A should be whistled for a double hit. This is always a judgement call on the part of the referee, but most cases are fairly obvious.
