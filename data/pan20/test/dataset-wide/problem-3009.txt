As I see it Tegmark is just proposing the exact opposite of the Kantian notion of noumena in an indirect form. Kind of by definition, even for Kant, the nature of noumena is an unresolvable question. If we relied logically upon noumena for any real purpose other than inspiration, our inability to access them would contradict the idea that we are fully capable of becoming intelligences and doing things like acting morally. The only real way out that leaves noumena intact at all seems to be the Hegelian response is that we perpetually 'move toward' them. But math itself does not work that way: what is entailed is resolved, even if you are not a Platonist. So a mathematical model of dialectic would be a single mathematical structure, whether or not it allows for everything to be resolved with a single pass through any given evolutionary process, or requires infinitely many reversals, or whether it can even be navigated by any possible mind. It is still the closure of some set of entailments that we cannot, by our given nature, question. (Presumably more than countably many basic notions are involved, since otherwise the nature of language keeps us from getting to closure.) The terminal point of the whole of dialectic has to be part of the model. Whether or not anyone can get there, Hegel's endpoint where "We, as God, know God," is in the model. Math has gotten beyond topology, and limit points don't make us worry anymore. So we can't avoid the question by ledger-de-main. Noumena either are or are not part of our model. But if we have them, we still can't know anything about them -- even whether or not they are really there. In that case, what is the difference? Whatever transcends those forms is lost to us, and we will not be able to understand, much less prove, anything about it. Either side of a proposition independent of your system is open for adoption into truth with no loss. So Tegmark's is, at the very least, an un-disprovable assertion, and one that sets the very frame of Occam's razor. To doubt it not only requires we create unnecessary entities, but that we acknowledge that those entities are utterly unhelpful to us, since they are necessarily unknowable and beyond consideration. What is the risk in presuming it is true, since we can never know anything about why it might be false? The extension by Deutsche is unwarranted and almost unrelated. No Turing Machine can compute randomness. There are only so many states, and we will be drawn back into them. So ideas like those behind classical Quantum Theory, etc. are not consistent with Deutsch. In effect, Deutsch is making the same error Nietzsche makes in deducing the Eternal Recurrence, only about non-computability rather than chaotic dynamics. Being arbitrarily close is not being right, and in endless time, eventually the gap with show some effect. 

Others have disagreed on which of those two things are meant. Xunzi noted that a lot of the Analects is about practice to make one good, so this may have meant 1. But the majority opinion seems to go with Mencius, who maintained "human nature is good". So at least one famous immediate disciple thought this phrase 'obviously' meant 2. Later commentators backed off from the question. After all, in practice, it can't really matter: we know that practice can improve the end result, and it is not really germane whether it works by merely cultivating native goodness or whether it inculcates goodness into something basically flawed. What works to produce the good, works. 

Being unconscious of a decision does not mean that you are not the one making the decision, or say anything about free will. When a trained cook adds just the right amount of salt by taste and touch "without consideration" that is still her mind, and her decision, even though it is unconscious. When athletes place their feet on slippery turf perfectly by training and instinct "without thinking" it is not like they really aren't thinking. And as automatic as these responses are, that unconscious thinking could still be either determined or free. According to the modern theory of expertise, (grown out of experimental validation of Heidegger's analysis of modes of Being,) we all do our best work when our consciousness is not trapped into making each individual decision that determines our next step, but is instead free to plan and to observe at a higher level. What this kind of study of thought timing in general indicates is that decision making is a continuous process and not an instantaneous event. It upholds a psychoanalytic prediction that the unconscious wish slowly becomes powerful enough to be an action, and goes through conscious processing only if it needs to be reconciled with competing alternatives in a specific way that requires explicit sequencing or particular responsibility. Even then, the conscious event is not the decision process, it is just one stage that the decision might go through. Most of the time, this is not necessary, so it does not happen, in which case your later memory of deciding is a story you make up for memory's sake. 

I think the notion of illusion, here, is not something that does not exist, it is something that is wholly other than it seems. As you note, if it did not exist, it would not be there to label. Dennet has no problem with the idea that you think, or that you are, or that it is necessary to do the latter in order to do the former. But he thinks we are badly served by viewing ourselves (and other animals) in terms of sequentially processing machines like those that we build, which principally process language by running it through a centralized nexus or a small number of highly general processors. He contends that the biology just does not support it, in terms of the sequencing, in terms of the generality of the processors, or in terms of the centralization of any part of it. The fact that we express our experience of consciousness in a way that is highly artificial does not make it any less real. Explaining it surely shouldn't make it go away. Explaining speciation did not make speciation go away. It did replace a non-explanation with an explanation. Hopefully we can do the same thing with the stream of thought. Unlike divine design, consciousness will survive being demystified. The notion of a sequential stream of thought is one part of the problem, and it is that notion that he is attacking when he says "consciousness is an illusion". So he proposes a metaphor for thinking that dismisses the three aspects of serialization, general processing and centralization, but presents the same surface appearance. He speaks in terms of 'multiple drafts'. Dennett's 'multiple drafts' model of human processing is much like the psychoanalytical model. The brain is a parallel process with disconnected entities making calls based on specialized subsets of information extracted asynchronously from different aspects of the available data. Most of these processes use heuristics less precise than actual logic to make their determinations, so they conflict and compete. The feeling that it is a coordinated whole is constructed as it is composed for memory, because we have specialized our memory socially to record stories, and not raw data. This is what is meant by a 'draft' -- it is a possible story competing to take up space in memory. As data stabilizes, it is edited. And edits continue even after it is transcribed. So what does the 'drafting' process do to the notion of a quale? Well, each of the competing processes has treated the same stimulus that we would ultimately attribute the quale in a slightly different way. They don't agree on the quale. Without consent from the full consciousness, does it exist? And the composing process does not compose a single unified version of the experience unless it is relevant to some aspect of a storyline that can be expected to verify the experience in a future reference. So it creates only the memory of the quale, and then only if it predicts that it might matter. At the point where agreement about the actual artifact is stable enough to record, it is no longer currently being experienced, it is a memory. At that point, was there any original? So there are not quale, there are memories of quale, but those are not quale, especially since they begin changing almost immediately so that related events can increase in consistency of recall over time. That means, as you deduce, that quale are just part of the illusion of unity. They exist, in some sense, or we could not remember them. But you cannot pin one down in the form we would expect it to have given how we will experience it in memory. Consciousness as a single storyline that is deterministically composed before or at the time it is experienced is an illusion we experience because whenever we experience a previous time, including the time immediately before the present, we are handed a storyline that is temporarily frozen in a state that makes it appear consistent with our logic. But it is only one among many actually present in memory, and it is currently under revision. 

Consider Newtonian dynamics. What happens when forces are truly and completely equal, say in the case of the proverbial rolling sphere balanced at the top of the perfectly smooth hill. The system simply does not say, the behavior is not determined, and there are multiple options. Now back off to old-school quantum mechanics. The set of outcomes that are truly just not determined is slightly wider, as what is traditionally considered the 'vibrational' or 'rotational' 'phase' is not the regular and repeating pattern that those concepts would lay upon it. So to say that the outcome does not supervene upon the physics would be false, but it would also be false to claim that we could reduce the outcome to the physics: There are cases where the physics does not fully determine the outcome. Now, obviously, we are only talking about our past theories of physics, and not about the process of nature itself. But if such a configuration (supervenience without reduction) can exist in our theories, it may exist in reality. (People like Roger Penrose clearly presume that it does.) This kind of relationship is presumed by many moral theories. Morality supervenes upon emotion and logic, but there is an element of morality that is not properly completely determined by those. The right thing to do is still open to random influences, leaving many paths open once both logic and emotion have been thoroughly accounted for, even though there are really no other inputs. Or there are clashes of balanced intensity between logical and emotional arguments, which still get resolved somehow. We may notice the gaps in justified feelings of guilt occurring after the fact. There is a moral quality that we may not have been able to account for at the time, but which still lays a debt upon us. If we could have predicted the moral effects of the action given our state and our information, we would have avoided it, but we cannot dismiss it. 

Without repeating myself too much, we are pretty sure that memory, as humans record it, is an exothermic chemical process. We cannot know what it is impossible for us to remember. That does not mean it isn't real, but we are not going to be aware of it. And reversal of time would be impossible to remember. The thermodynamic arrow of time assumes physics is arranged in such a way that time never reverses. I do not think we can ascribe truth or falsehood to that, because we are dependent upon the idea of irreversible time to so high a degree that we seem unable to frame experiments that would test the idea. I think that we can imagine multiple dimensions of time, or even a rather complex topology imposed upon unidirectional time, but not a form of time that is singular but freely reverses. To the degree we can imagine reversible time as a version of multidimensional time, it would appear to be indistinguishable from raw indeterminacy, which we already observe, and to which we ascribe different causes. I don't trust Popper's notion of falsifiability as a definition of science, but it is a wise position to obey if you are trying to think scientifically: It is inappropriate to make decisions about the truth of something, if you cannot imagine a result that would contradict your assumptions. And I would assert that we are biologically incapable of that particular feat of imagination. So, I would go for this position being something very much like a tautology: It is necessarily and untestably true dictated not by deductive logic or definition, but instead by other basic structures of human thinking. 

Everett's Many Worlds interpretation of quantum dynamics takes this basic form. It has been elaborated into the 'Multiverse theory', but this is not really any different. 

In a liberal economy, purchase is a form of speech, if freedom of speech has value, we are free to make our choices of purchase in any way we choose. The ability to choose between providers is the lynch-pin of functioning capitalism. It is not unethical to ask someone not to do something unethical. It is not even unethical for someone to assemble hundreds of people to demand it in unison. So it is not unethical to coordinate purchases in order to send the same message. Speech is not force unless it involves threats. Refraining from contact, outside an existing obligation, is not a threat, even when it causes harm. Refusing to give money to a homeless person is not force, even if it causes him to die. (Whether it is ethical remains open, but it is not force.) Many people refuse to give to various homeless people because they fear that the use of that money would be unethical and harm either others or the person it is given to, perhaps from previous observations of that person's behavior. This is exactly the position one is in when one participates in a boycott -- you are refusing contact, and not giving money because you fear its use would not be ethical, based on previous observations of the recipient's behavior. 

I think the idea of "arguing against physicalism" (or for that matter arguing for it) is basically misleading in a deep way, and is an attempt to do religion by philosophical means. Not that that is bad, but it is theology and needs to recognize that association. If you answered the question of the tenability of physicalism clearly and definitively in either direction, it would remain in some other form, ever-retreating and impossible to really address. First of all, pro-mind, or even pro-quale arguments are not anti-physical arguments. One can accept physicalism and not believe the mind and the brain are identical. Richard Dawkins' notion of memetic ecology is clearly physicalist without dismissing the idea of mind or that minds contain language-borne ideas that have a life of their own and survive the death of the brain. Jung was alternately completely physicalist and an outright mystic, without contradicting himself. Tavistock psychoanalyts can accept the brain as physical and still see ideas unconsciously make their way from one person to another in a group, play out manipulations of the group mind and get resolved without ever being noticed, much less articulated, by the minds/brains processing them. So physical does not even rule out mysterious or spooky. The mind can be an epiphenomenon of the brain and its network of interrelations with other brains without it ceasing to exist, and without all of philosophy collapsing into neurology. Just as atomism does not contradict our ability to make rigid structures, physicalism does not contradict our ability to discuss ideas that transcend individuals. Second, to my mind, this is a clearly undecidable proposition. Given phenomena, you can either assume something or nothing is behind them. If we got behind them and discovered a basis, the 'nothing' camp would immediately simply add that basis to the list of things we consider physical, and, the end of time notwithstanding, the 'something' camp would still find unexplained phenomena. We discovered electricity, something that exists in some weird distributed state that freely reaches across empty space, something as spectral as we could imagine in the 18th century, and when it stopped being entirely mysterious, instead of declaring there to be another layer of reality, we just decided it was physics. Then we discovered quantum mechanics, something that seems to strictly limit our ability to predict physical behavior, and instead of deciding we needed another name for this deeper level of causation, we devised wave functions and declared "the distribution of the possibility of the location of a particle in wave form", to be physics. Our ability to declare things physical has no bounds. So like God and atheism, physicalism and non-physicalism are not a philosophically addressable questions, they are faiths. People who insist on deciding undecidable propositions have an agenda outside the truth. So, what is the agenda behind rejecting physicalism? Why put up with the question? Third, we have already seen the 'synthetic' moment where this dichotomy ceases to be a useful guide. We got to Hegel, and the notion of human history as the attempt for the physical and the mental aspects of the universe to find common ground -- for matter (which is also God) to understand itself. So there is an 'agnostic' position here, we have middle ground, but we never walk over it. We keep the dichotomy clean, as though all intermediate positions are nonsense. Finally, this argument tends to exist to eliminate other arguments, and that, to me, is an indicator of its ultimately destructive nature. If you decide something is or is not physical, you seem to have answered a question about what it actually is, an how it works. But you have not actually begun to try to do so. Once it is physical or non-physical, depending upon who you are, you can relegate it to some science or to some religious position, and stop considering it philosophically until that science or that palliative framing gets to some unresolvable question. But that is just laziness. There is no reason only quantum mechanics seems philosophical to us, and not field theory, or thermodynamics. We just don't like the fact that those other sciences have huge historical weight, and a lot of facts in them.
