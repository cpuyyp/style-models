Accept additional input parameter (like an integer with possible values 1,2,3) If passed 1 in the input parameter, at the time of returning result return the first result set. If 2 in input parameter then return 2. In main procedure, call this procedure thrice. Each time with different input parameter number (i.e. 1 , 2, 3). 

Only thing is remaining is to include an exception for the NA or "Input Does not exists" case which can be easily handled. 

I will suggest to have a table valued function. This function will accept your string as an input parameter and then return a table by splitting the inputs separated by ";" in different rows with an index ID. You can use this function internally with you logic and determine the MAX(Us) from mapping table. Below is the sample example for the function. 

I guess you can try something like below. This is combination of identity column primary key with the computed column. Hope this helps. 

You can make use of the procedure to get the logical foreign key information. But the limitation is you have to execute is by passing the table name as the input parameter. More info for the same can be found at below MSDN library. sp_fkeys Alternatively you can make use of below query to get all the tables from sys.tables and check if the same table object_id exists in the sys.foreign_key_columns. 

Query 3: get number of core usage as well as CPU time (note this query has a lot of other uses like desk I/O) 

in-order to change default value you need to edit you file and look for if the parameter exist then you need to edit the current value to 600 and restart the service, otherwise you need to add the parameter and restart the service. Demo: my.ini content (I am using windows here, but MySQL) configuration is the same 

If enabled, checksums will be calculated for each data page. you can read more about check some in the following site: $URL$ or the following website also tell about checksum $URL$ Use checksums on data pages to help detect corruption by the I/O system that would otherwise be silent. Enabling checksums may incur a noticeable performance penalty. This option can only be set during initialization, and cannot be changed later. If set, checksums are calculated for all objects, in all databases. 

you can use the following script: 1) if you want to get the latest backup only use the following command: 

I think you need the OUTPUT clause to return any new recordids. Further depending on what you want to do, you may be interested in using a MERGE statment instead of just an insert. For instnce someone whose email has remained teh same but whose address has changed coudl be updated rather than having a new record added as seems to be the case in what you are doing. 

This is a really tough problem in the US. Names are not unique and often change during a person's lifetime or are presented differntly (Rob versus Robert for instance), so they can never be used to identify the patient except in conjunction with some more realiable information. Health insurance number and provider changes much more frequently and may be the same for multiple members of the family. SSN is supposedly unique, but there is fraud around it. Same with Driver's liscense number which of course not everyone will have. Personally, I would start with insurance policy number and date of birth and name combination, then ssn and date of birth and name combination. I would check address and phone to give me additonal assurance when they match but not much weight if they don't. Additonally I would use blood type as a rule out factor if it is known (and we all know the hospital vampires will be taking blood samples) as that doesn't change. Name matching would have to be fuzzy match due to the name varaition problem. Other things should generally look for an exact match first themna fuzzy match if the name confidence is really high (could have been a typo entering the SSN). 

you can follow the tutorial in this link in-order to use PostgreSQL under C# and .net framework $URL$ for managing the database side you can use (in my opinion one of the best database management for PostgreSQL check the following link $URL$ $URL$ or EMS $URL$ . those database management program will help you a lot if you want to make the management of the database using GUI (easier to use than terminal screen) 

To understand the problem and try to fix it you need to check related logs: listener.log, alert log, trace file, etc possible causes and solutions: 

Consequences: if there is a slow query(s) your system will be too slow, hang, or even go out of memory. if QueryTimeout is disabled from MySQL or the connector it will stay until its finished (how to enable it from MySQL 

Error means: The connection between Client and Server process was broken. Possible causes and general troubleshooting: 

I found the Answer after long investigation, the problem in my case is under is not running fine, so in-order to fix this issue I need to use root user then navigate to and execute the script. it will ask you to enter the correct values and replace the old ones. after that open new terminal and use everything will work fine. Note in-order to get everything back to Normal state I copied everything inside the old into the new one. 

What we have understood here is you want to migrate selective data from selective tables from SQL 2008 server into SQL express edition. Have you considered using the import/export data feature on the SQL management studio? Import/Export wizard can be accessed by logging into server using the SQL Management Studio. Here is the link to MSDN library. You can select the source as SQL 2008 server (production) and destination as SQL Express Edition (development). And then map the required tables and columns. If required, truncate the tables from the development environment first if you want to have a clean data. Once data is migrated, you can perform the update queries to remove/mask any personal or confidential data. Let me know if this serves the purpose else we will delete the answer later and will think something else. 

EDIT: One additional point. You have to very precise while making us the if logic over here. As the same procedure needs to be called thrice, if may have an performance impact depending on what logic you are trying to implement. If possible make use of the same if block to incorporate all logic for the specific return scenario and keep the generic part in the head. 

And a good bit of slow performance in databases is due to bad indexing or badly performing queries. No amount of tweaking the server itself will fix those. Findout what they are doing when it gets slow. Don't just randomly fix things and hope that things improve. Know what is causing the issue and measure before and after to make sure you have improved. 

And of cousre you would want associated tables for the customer, Customer address, partslookup, labor tasks lookup, etc. You might also want to provide a place on your form to add a new part or labor task to the appropriate lookup table. Sometimes you may need to quote something that is not already in the system and the best place to do that is while you are creating the quote. 

In SQL Server 2000, you cannot use the results of a stored proc directly in another query. However, you can insert them into a #temp table and then join to that. But you must create the temp table structure first, you can't use select into. 

OEM is a web-based application so the language is determined by the default on web browser like Internet Explorer, make sure to change it to English (note you may see Internet Explorer menu in English but the default language (localization is not)) it can be change from internet option. give it a try 

I have user called created under under MS Windows 2008R2, I want to grant this user select privileges on all databases except MySQL database, note I have around 200 database inside this instance. EDIT: 

increase memory for MySQL. at least by double memory value to test if the new memory that reserved to MySQL is enough. reformat the transaction to take less memory. 

there is a lot of options but choosing the right one is up to you, this is some of the options : 1) Adminer: $URL$ 2) DBeaver: $URL$ 3)DBVisualizer Free: $URL$ 4) sql developer (but you need to install the plugins first) : $URL$ 

RMAN can be used for cross-platform tasks but you cannot restore your classic full backup from Linux to Windows 

I would go for the check constraints, you cannot be positive that records will never get manually entered or adjusted. Data integrity trumps avoiding nulls every single time. 

You don't want simpler, you probably need more complex. Invocing is a complex field that requires a good bit of accounting knowledge (knowledge of internal controls to prevent fraud in particular and how those would be implemented in your database). But lets start with a simple example, customers do not have only 1 address (or ship to only one address), so you should have a separate address table. You should have a separate phone table. You should have lookup tables for phone types and address types. You probably need product lookup tables. I can't say for sure in mysql, but float is generally an inexact datatype and should not be used for any number you intend to do calclutions with. Not unless you like dealing with rounding errors. Or losing money. Accountants tend to hate that kind of thing. Shipping address should be linked to the invoice not the customer. I may ship one order to a customer in Maine one day and another to a differnt person in Washington the next. I may ship to any one of my three offices or to my home or to my parent's home. How are you planning to maintain those updated by and updated date fields? They shoudl be in a trigger or they are useless. Normally products have some sort of product details that can vary such as color or size or no of items in the package. You have a description field for this but 80 chazractesr seems way too small to me. Truly you need to learn normalization before you even attempt to design a database, let alone one with serious legal implications. Taxes can be quite difficult depending on how many states or countries you are selling to and the typesof products you sell. Without knowing more detatils it is imposooible to design a good set of tables for taxes. There is no way under the sun that I would consider deigning such a thing without consultations with a good experienced accountant. Preferably one with auditing experience. There are many many professionally designed accounting packages that do invoicing, it would be cheaper and far better from a legal standpoint to buy one. 

I am moving databases from one instance to another (by detaching databases from the first instance, move and log files to another location, and attach them to the new instance), unfortunately could not attach some of them, and miss calculate number of databases that have issues, how to check all files that is not attached to SQL server from specific directory. 

the dump location will be inside your machine under C drive but if you did not specify the directory the dump location will by inside MySQL\bin 

since you are already logged in into MySQL then you need to inter the following command to read and execute text file 

Regarding the first error: user who run SQL server service doesn't have permission on that directory. as for the second error: "an exception occurred while executing a transact-sql statement or batch" its seems this is a mapping issue Map To Credential. or if the snapshot agent exist make sure its running and refresh the GUI. 

Redo Log Buffers: A log buffer is a circular buffer in the SGA that holds information about changes made to the database. This information is stored in the redo entries. Redo entries contain the information necessary to reconstruct or redo changes made to the database by insert, update, delete, create, alter, or drop operations. Redo entries are primarily used for database recovery as necessary. Redo Log: The most crucial structure for recovery operations is the redo log, which consists of two or more preallocated files that store all changes made to the database as they occur. Every instance of an Oracle Database has an associated redo log to protect the database in case of an instance failure. for more information about database structure please refer to $URL$
