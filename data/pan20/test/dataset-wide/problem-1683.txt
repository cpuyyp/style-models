All other inputs are identical so I'm quite certain that the LVM portion is the culprit. doesn't tell me anything either. Has anyone else experienced this? EDIT: In previous attempts I was running the command as a regular user with sudo. I logged in as root and ran the same command which seemed to work. To a point, anyway. I am now able to get RHEL 7.0 to kickstart with an LVM configuration, but RHEL 7.1 now simply throws . When I submitted the bug report it merely said with little indication as to which settings it could not find. There are a few existing bug reports with this error but none seem to follow the same path that led up to it. As an aside, I'm baffled that Red Hat still has problems with both and . Additionally, it took two attempts to get RHEL 7.0 to actually start the installation. The first attempt left me at the screen with the installation media section stating . I re-ran the same command with the same installation media and kickstart file. This attempt went through cleanly. 

With the exception of the option, they are identical. I don't know if this is how they are supposed to be configured. EDIT 3 The NOTIFY announcement appears to only be sent when I restart . I tried and but neither did anything. Only sent the announcement. 

I have a functioning PXE configuration that allows to boot to an installation by Kickstart or rescue, both via RHEL6 media. I'm trying to add DBAN to the mix to make for a more complete solution for our needs. I have it set up to boot and it will load, but it keeps failing with 

Why wouldn't the serial be updating? EDIT Based on the comment by yoonix, I've removed all but the one server which I know to be the master for the zone: 

We have Asigra set up by our service provider and we need a way to build better reports than those that are built-in. We have the Java DS-User package installed so, according to Asigra documentation, JasperReports is the option to go with. However, JasperReports Community version is limited in its abilities and paying out for the Enterprise version will be a hard sell. I found that ReportServer provides some of the functionality that the JR Community version has crippled, but I don't know if it is able to connect to Asigra easily. Has anyone put this to use or any other, similar package with Asigra? 

I posted it over at $URL$ as suggested by Sirex in chat. It was pointed out that I had renamed the file module manifest to users.pp, but it should have been init.pp as per the automatic loading of classes and subclasses that is built into Puppet. 

What I'm curious about now is how to tell the rescue environment to get the rescue image from a URL. I'm unfamiliar with all of the kernel options and Rescue mode seems to be a special case anyway. I tried "URL=", but that doesn't do anything. Is this possible? 

Looking at the man page for either mail or sendmail has not clued me into which option I need to use. I did see in the sendmail manpage that there is the -O option which uses the option=value format. I tried that instead of the -S listed above. Still no dice. The manpage even says the -O option is ignored. Can someone help me out with this? 

For some reason I thought IPA was running a tomcat server for the web interface. I think I was confusing it with another application I recently installed. After paying closer attention to the installation output I realized it is only running which made fixing this a lot easier. 

I'm trying to get Ansible to set up the EPEL repository on a new AWS instance. It fails if I use the module. If I use the module and try to install it over the wire it reports as successful but doesn't actually do anything. module: 

I have a PXE menu configuration that I'm working on. It incorporates the RHEL6 Rescue option in order to perform repairs after booting from the network. The Rescue boot environment asks three basic questions to set itself up: Language, Keymap, and source for the rescue image. I have the first two sorted by adding the "lang=" and "keymap=" options to the "append" line in the PXE menu: 

I'm trying to figure out how to get some of our servers to send email through our relay when I use the mail command. If I simply type 

I've also tried without the root= or init= options with the same result. I'm not even entirely sure about those options. Not much that I've found online gives much detail or explanation. One thing I know for sure, is that right now I don't want to enable the autonuke option. I simply want to load up the interactive method. Has anyone been able to make this work? EDIT: Potentially pertinent information The server that I'm testing this on (and, in fact, 99% of our servers) are VMs running on VMware ESXi. The CD works when I attach it as an ISO to the VMware console and boot to it. 

END EDIT For the zone file in the example, I've incremented the serial number on the master then ran on all of them (master and three slaves). The time stamp on the zone files on each slave is being updated, however, the serial number on the slave doesn't update. The slaves are updating, though: 

Each of the IPs in the setting is one of the slaves. Example slave. Again, there are several more zones but they are identical save for the domain. 

The dialog that contains the error also provides debug information and a backtrace leading up to the error. I have not been able to find any cause of the problem when sifting through this data. I downloaded the RHEL 7.0 installation media. When pointing the VM at that during the configuration the installation does not throw the error and runs normally. I find it strange that on RHEL 7.1 can't install a RHEL 7.1 VM. But that's neither here nor there. Is it possible to add RHEL 7.1 to the list? If so will it be recognized or are there other things that relies on to ensure the process functions correctly? 

When I created the kickstart file I had the directive uncommented. It failed but I did not think to look at the details so I don't know why. The Red Hat knowledgebase article omitted this directive so I commented it out. The issue persisted. That said, now that it is again uncommented and allowed to be executed as part of the kickstart it is working. So, since I didn't look at the details when I first encountered this error I don't know what the problem originally was. 

Our infrastructure has a Kickstart server which can serve up RHEL6 builds with some post-installation scripting that handles customization and configuration. I'm currently in the process of updating the scripting to handle RHEL5 for those few instances that require it. At this time, I have disabled the automatic execution of the scripts on a RHEL5 test build so that I can run them manually and evaluate output and errors. I'm seeing an odd thing that I've never encountered before. On this clean build, the /etc/hosts file has an entry for a public IP (presumably one of our service provider's). I have no idea how it is getting added. NetworkManager isn't configured to run and I don't think it even has the ability to do that. I'm also pretty sure this is not default behavior for any version of RHEL. Has anyone seen this before or have suggestions as to what I should be looking at to prevent it? 

There are not other obvious errors. When using simpler partitions the installation goes through cleanly. The lvm partitioning scheme in the kickstart file that fails: 

I installed FreeIPA on a VM. I went through the configuration and registered a client with . After adding some users and groups on the IPA server I have confirmed that it is functioning properly. During the configuration there was no question asking which IPs the server should be listening on. Most of the services (kerberos, dns, smtp, etc) are set up to listen on both of the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. I haven't actually configured IPv6, though so it is only really listening on the link-local address. If I telnet to port 80 either locally via localhost or remotely via the IPv4 address and send a the response tells me that the "document has moved" with a link to the https URL. But, since it isn't listening on port 443 at the IPv4 address I'm unable to get to it. Also, despite being able to telnet to port 80 remotely, if I attempt to navigate to the same IP in my browser I get "Server not found". Same result if I navigate to the https URL. How can I configure the Web UI to listen on IPv4? I only need port 443. 

I'm trying to install a VM using using a kickstart file. I've tried both RHEL 7.0 and RHEL 7.1. In both cases using LVM seems to make the installation fail. After a timeout it drops me to the prompt and informs me that I can find information about the failure using . I've done this and have found nothing. Looking at the file, though, shows errors related to :
