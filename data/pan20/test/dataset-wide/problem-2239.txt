Ethylene glycol has a boiling point of 197Â°C, well above that of water. If you're desperate, your best bet is to set up a solar still to extract the water from the antifreeze. The difference in boiling points means that your still will be producing reasonably pure water. Distilling the washer fluid has the problem that methanol boils at a lower temperature than water. The initial output of the still will be a poisonous methanol/water mix, and there's no good way to tell when the methanol level has dropped far enough to be safe. A long-shot option is to make your water. Hydrocarbons produce carbon dioxide and water vapor when burned; you could attempt to disassemble your car's exhaust system and use it as a condenser to capture some of that water vapor. Of course, in the long run, you're likely to wind up with heavy-metal poisoning, or unburned hydrocarbons giving you cancer. 

There are three fluids in your car that contain water: the battery electrolyte, the washer fluid, and the coolant. Everything else is hydrocarbon-based, and in a properly-functioning car, contains no water. 

I would suggest looking at the Point Reyes National Seashore, close to Petaluma, less than a hour north of San Francisco. It is a beautiful area ranging from thick woods to large open bluffs to the seashore. Because it is on the coast, the weather is much more temperate than up in the mountains. There are more miles of trails than you could explore in one trip. Camping is only allowed in four designated campgrounds. They all require a hike to get there, and they must be reserved well in advance before they fill up. This area takes its reservations (and other rules) seriously, so I wouldn't try to wing it. I expect they have to be strict or they would be overrun, being so close to the SF area. When we were there, about 15 years ago, we stayed for three nights in the Wildcat Camp. It was about 6 miles in to the campsite. I'm sure that you could coordinate a trip that would take you to different sites over multiple days. One word of warning: the deer ticks were prevalent. Perhaps they won't be in early April, but they certainly were in August :) 

Short answer: there's a lot of public land, most likely state owned (not federal), that's available for hunting. Counties offering public hunting by annual permit $URL$ There might be limitations for nonresidents and/or based on what you plan to hunt with (e.g. firearm, black powder, bow) but this looks like a great starting point for information: Public Hunting and Access to TPWD Lands "Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) offers a variety of hunting opportunities through two public hunting systems."[2] Here's the Texas page for licensing: $URL$ Here's a breakout of licenses with associated fees for both residents and non-residents: $URL$ If you can add a bit more information about what you're looking for I can try to be a bit more specific. [1] $URL$ [2] $URL$ Side note, as for search terms try, "texas game and wildlife hunting license" and "texas public hunting land". I suspect you'll get fewer ranch ads if you're specifically including the word "public" in your query. 

We hiked a well-packed gradual trail in New England (Mt. Moosilauke in NH) and debated what would be faster - skinning up on AT skis or just boots with skis on your back. Argument for skis on the back is the idea that 1 pound on your foot is equal to 5-6 pounds in your back. Trail was gradual and the snow was quite packed. 

While out hiking today, I came across a spot where someone had fired off a couple dozen shotgun shells, then left the spent cartridges lying around. Dealing with those was simple (put them in my trash bag for later disposal), but there were also four discarded live shells. What's the best way of dealing with live ammunition while out hiking? I don't like the idea of having it just rattling around in my pack, and once I get it home, I don't know how or where I'd dispose of it. 

The presence of a ford in a river is a local condition: it's a point in the flow where the river has leveled out, producing a wide, slow, shallow flow. In addition, a ford generally has a hard bottom, either naturally or through "improvement" with imported gravel. The presence of a ford at one point says absolutely nothing about the fordability of that river anywhere else. In answer to your secondary question, "you can ford it here by car" does strongly imply "you can ford it here on foot". 

If you were the only visitor to the area, the lowest impact would be to defecate on the surface and leave it. Few animals bury their waste, so natural disposal has evolved around dealing with surface waste. However, you aren't the only visitor. Burial slows decomposition and disrupts the soil, but it reduces the ability of microorganisms to reach water supplies, and it keeps the area looking cleaner. Packing out eliminates the impact to the local area, but increases the net impact because now you need to deal with whatever you packed the waste in. Waste-disposal techniques are about reducing the collective impact of many people in an area, rather than the impact of the individual. 

In summary, they like to lay in wait for their prey and take it unawares. And they like easy prey. Most hikers simply don't worry about them, and most people never see one. Of course, I saw no references at all to being attacked while sleeping! Hence my personal preference to use a tent :) Back to my own exciting story, here's something that I didn't expect: the cougar raked pine needles and leaves over the ground where we had peed! Maybe it left some of its own urine there, too, but I didn't think to smell around :) 

I was backpacking with my nine-year-old daughter two years ago in Oregon near Mt. Hood. I awoke (in our tent) to the noise of a cougar walking around outside. I assumed it was a black bear and didn't learn otherwise until we found its tracks the next morning. Anyway, I made noise by running my fingers over the nylon tent fabric. It was pretty loud, and the "bear" ran off through the underbrush. Made really good time for a bear, too! However, unlike a bear, the cat came back (at least) twice more that same night. Each time, I scared it off with the same noise, without leaving my tent. We were there for two more nights, but the cat didn't visit us again. We had our food hanging from a tree, out of reach. The rest of our gear was in the tent with us. Seeing how it behaved, I think there is no chance at all of one coming into a tent. The strangeness, the noise, and the uncertainty would all keep the cat away. But I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable sleeping around cougars without a tent. I did a lot of research after we got home. Here's what I found out: 

For the most part, your list looks reasonable for traditional (ie. non-ultralight) backpacking. The most important thing now is to get the pack fitted and balanced properly, and then get used to moving around while carrying the weight. 20kg hanging off your back will change your balance, so you need to get used to it. A few things to look at: 

Depending on the mug, you might save weight with a plastic one (and gain the ability to handle it while it's full of boiling water), but you'd lose the ability to cook directly in the mug. 

If your vehicle has a closed metallic structure, you are definitely safer inside than out: if lightning strikes your vehicle, or near your vehicle, the metal will conduct the electricity away from you. The protection is almost as good as if you were inside a building with a lightning rod. If you are in an open-top vehicle, or one with a non-conductive roof, things change: in an open-top vehicle, your head is one of the highest things around, while lightning striking a non-conductive roof is likely to burn through and strike you. In that case, I'd exit the vehicle and take whatever "outside in a thunderstorm" precautions are appropriate for your location.
