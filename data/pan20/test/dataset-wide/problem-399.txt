As for the notable exceptions... We're still not sure why cephalopods have evolved to be as apparently intelligent as they are. Some seem to think it may be due to sexual selection, female cuttlefish seem more likely to select males that are smart enough to disguise themselves to sneak by the larger stronger males. So... If you're working on intelligence in an alien world, just make it sexy and things should progress pretty well... 

Believe it or not some of this was actually done in real life. See: $URL$ The first thing that came to mind when reading the question was the corpse catapult. It was a tactic used when laying siege to castles. Plague victims, corpses, and sometimes even excrement were flung over castle walls in the hope of spreading disease and weakening the moral of the defenders. There's also a long gross tradition of dipping blades and arrowheads in filth and poison in the hope of turning a flesh wound into a fatal wound. Overall I'm thinking that making your army smell like death and filth won't be all that effective though... Armies would have smelled pretty awful back then regardless. March 5000 men and draft animals for a few miles and everyone'sâ€‹ going to smell like feces without extra efforts... But many tribes and armies did go out of their way to "look scary" using mutalted corpses, bones and so on. There may be some psychological advantages in doing this, but it has also been known to backfire and get them labeled as barbarians, savages, and more recently as war criminals. 

And so many more. But who cares about what they did add to science, we want to know what they can add to science, and there are different criteria measuring that. We want people who... Died before they could release a truly major contribution to the public. Have important knowledge that was lost in the past. (Library of Alexandria, Pompeii, Advanced Art of Memory techniques) Have highly adaptable minds so that they don't freak out when they suddenly pop into existence. Those fitting at least some of these new criteria are. 

Awesome stuff is common knowledge Thousands of earth species are all but unknown to most, but the interesting ones (note subjectivity) are usually recognized. You have probably heard of a porcupine, skunk, lion, rattlesnake, funnel spider and plenty of other dangerous or unique animals, but how many have you actually seen in person. In the same way, knowledge of the strange alien ooglyboogly species will become common due to their unique blinding bioluminescence. The mighty strength of the notafillername is something all remember and fear. Amazing accross the universe Not exactly though. Before the final approach of the target planet, careful research is done (basic audience focusing) regarding what exactly impresses the planet's largest species. Some planets won't even be considered in the circus's route because its culture is such a tough crowd. Now as for humans... Being ourselves humans, we set the tone of "average" to ourselves. Other beings would be so drastically different that some mundane actions of ours are amazing in perspective. Just as monkeys are more naturally athletic than humans, humans may be more dexterous, resilient, or intelligent than most other species. 

A lot of the things that can crystallize inside the human body can cause excruciating pain if they crystallize in the right spot, or if you eventually need to pass or excrete the crystal at some point. Think of things like: 

Advancement in cigarette manufacturing technology Perhaps motivated by lagging sales and government pressure big tobacco finally gets around to producing cigarettes that are every bit as tasty and addictive, but substantially less or even non lethal. Overnight millions of anxious, agitated former smokers light up again. 

Sharp on both sides it's a little lighter and more versatile than your usual axe, but it would still be a bit too heavy to lug around for 5 months. Which led me to thinking about purpose built survival gear, specifically mountaineering equipment like: 

Almost definitely not. The sheer amount of energy required to lift an object of this magnitude would be far out of its capabilities. The only plausible escape of gravity would be partial, meaning it would be trivial to fling small pieces of the blob out of the planet's gravity well provided the blob is intelligent enough to even do that. These projectiles would be unguided and not likely land anywhere suitable to consume or reproduce. 

This question becomes impossible to answer without knowing many other variables such as the rate of consumption, mean time between food discovery, speed of blob, and specific details about the local ecology. The best bet is to maximize surface area by stretching into a pancake like object for the highest food collection rate. *C stands for organically bound carbon or carbon being used in a living system. 

What about community service hours? You could even make the punishment fit the crime in some cases. If the person is found guilty of jaywalking, make them to spend their days off as a crossing guard. If the person is found guilty of littering, make them to pick up trash on the side of a highway. And so on... This kind of alternative sentencing is already becoming a little more common in some juvenile and misdemeanor courts in the US. 

Depends on which definition of "efficient" you're looking at. Efficient: achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense. If you're really shooting for minimum wasted effort or expense, couldn't you just do nothing and wait around? On a long enough timeline most all civilizations are ultimately doomed; the sun will super nova or burn out eventually, large asteroid strikes happen every so often, and so on... 

Wikipedia ballparks earth's total biomass at 560 billion tons C*. If the blobs are able to consume all life, given a rough estimate of bacterial volume/weight (0.6um3/picogram) lands a rough mass at. The volume of the Mediterranean Sea (I am skeptical about this answer and open to revisions) 

So it looks like you have a very dangerous slime bacteria. Unfortunately, the blob's existence would not necessarily lead to mass extinction. Assuming these blobs can starve, they will likely fall into a predator/prey cycle. 

Genetic control The first matter to deal with is to ask what level of genetic modification is possible. If we are limited by standards slightly more advanced than today's, then we have a few options. We can.. Reduce or remove the production of certain catecholamines, deflating some riot situations. Reduce or remove the production of serotonin, causing memory loss. (What was i angry about?) Modifying the image of a "perfect being." More specifically, giving a genetic bias towards a certain leader figure. Studies have shown that completely irrelevant genetic traits have contributed to public image. So what if the perfect match happens to be the current ship captain. Kind of genetic There is the ability to genetically hamper the supply of insulin to artificially administer diabetes. This could very quickly nip rebellions in the bud if the only insulin supplies are located at secure nodes. In the same way, albeit somewhat less cruel, get everyone on a certain drug and watch as rebellions struggle through withdrawal before crawling back in surrender. (Never mind, just as cruel) Other Rather than using genetics (a recipe for some resistant hero to arrive), use neuroscience. As soon as someone gives birth, transport the newborn to a government approved "educational" site, guaranteed to improve IQ by looks in PR folder 20%. What is actually happening is basic conditioning. While curbing any rebellious thoughts for the next 2-3 years, the young will be fed direct associations between rebellion and pain, and conversely be given compliance and reward. As an added bonus, anyone audacious enough to not put their newborn through this liberating process will have the child labeled as being in possession of a lower intelligence. 

The Amish believe in what's often referred to as "non-resistance", they don't serve in the military, join police forces, or sue in court. So the crusades very likely wouldn't have happened. 

I think IED's (improvised explosive devices) will still be with us in the distant future. Simple homemade explosives can vary considerably, but the materials are often cheap and fairly accessible. All you really need is a vessel, shrapnel, and a compound that will rapidly produce gasses when mixed or ignited. Molotov cocktails are easier, but they're not nearly as effective or as scary as pipe bombs. 

It looks like everyone so far is focusing on biochemical/solar. So, I'll toss out another theory... I'm not sure if it could be harnessed in any really useful way, but I'm picturing trees that could build and store static electric charges. I'm thinking that in a windy enviroment where the branches are frequently blowing and rubbing against each other it may be feasible for a strong static charge to develop... The hard part for the tree would be insulating/storing the charge and only discharging it when needed. 

I see these happening automatically given the wide range of opinions on nearly everything, except the last one. Unless abilities are one-in-a-million and relatively new, they will just be a common part of culture. Heritability would stimulate group associations, and stereotyping would further that, however, the most surefire way to implement associations is most likely geographic ability distribution. Some kind of landmark or location bestows abilities in a small radius around itself, whether it covers a town or a country, leads settlers to gradually become affected by -insert ability here-. The fast way: Take a stock super-power, but then add in a caveat that (usually) blows the helping half out of the water. More examples: Subject can quickly understand anything read, but is plagued with short term memory loss, rendering new knowledge generally useless. Shape-shifting normally causes death in the infant stage as it transforms users into their mental images (including non-sentient ones). Some, usually mentally damaged to impair visualization, can eventually grasp the ability, but the risk still remains. 

I would go with bunkers and scapegoats... As already mentioned bunkers could offer some protection from a direct attack, but scapegoats would probably be a better over all strategy. As spring approached each year the local ranchers and herdsmen would be tapped for a few sacrificial animals, not unlike many ancient cultures, only in this context rather than trying to appease an angry deity, its dragon feeding season. So as the snow melts livestock would be staked out around the foothills of the dragons' layer. Think of it as a wall of meat, that keeps the dragons full and spares the village. If your dragons are intelligent, they will probably get used to the arrangement and recognize that a healthy village produces a reliable yearly food source. If your dragons are savage beasts they will still probably be happy with easy prey that they don't have to travel as far for. 

I believe this implies that answers should address how the AI manages internal infrastructure meaning that humans will, at least in the beginning, manage military affairs, international relations, and other matters that directly effect the economy less immediately, as self-sustenance is a future sub-goal. Short term goal Making everyone happy is impossible, but being an AI it will likely try to maximize human happiness, leading to a myriad of secondary goals. 

The first thing to accept is that the human race does not have a single mind. The criteria that helps someone decide not to research these alternate humans will cause someone else to. In other words, there will always be people that want to study them, but there are some countermeasures. It's inhumane As a front-line defense, make sure they have similar biology. Very similar. So similar that any attempt to study them would turn up results exactly the same as any human. In this light, media (and social media) would begin to take over. While this is merely a superficial solution, it will at least halt large scale, public research and overall reduce funding towards like studies. It's illegal Something atrocious happened half a century ago involving horrible experiments on the species. Over the following years, laws were put in place making the suggestion of trying to understand them highly sensitive. Once it's tied up in politics and made controversial, a great amount of support will be needed to change the status quo. It's complex Just make their various abilities too difficult too understand. Maybe the details span with information several orders of magnitude larger. Maybe some as of yet undiscovered scientific principle gets in the way of recording data. Something physically prevents them from grasping their nature. Or maybe passive telepathy bores all the researchers to death. 

I'm picturing a world with a permanent, dark, overcast sky, but I'm wondering how dark it can be before photosynthesis is no longer an option. It looks like there are a good number of plants that have good shade tolerance, but I can't find any real information on the bottom limit. There also appear to be, a few plants that don't need to photosynthesize at all. The closest analog I can think of is the oceanic zones, photic and aphotic. Photic being the top layer of a body of water where most, if not all, of your photosynthesis is happening. Aphotic being too deep for enough light to penetrate. Apparently the photic zone: 

And now for something completely different... Use harlots, concubines, prostitutes. The lowest class in many societies, but they (as an organization at least) have enough dirt on enough people to keep things under wraps. They're the guild, or the contact point. Anyone who acknowledges contacting them would be an immediate pariah. So polite people don't, or at least they don't talk about it.
