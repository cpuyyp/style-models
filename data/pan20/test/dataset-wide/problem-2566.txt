Normally to distinguish between Hindu ideas and Buddhist ideas of afterlife we use reincarnation and rebirth as different terms. Reincarnation is often used to describe a soul (self) being born again in another life like Hindus and other faiths believe. Rebirth is used as a word in Buddhism to describe the aggregates constantly changing and coming together to continue existence. There is no self involved in this process. This quote sounds like he's talking about the term rebirth: 

Right view Right resolve Right speech Right action Right livelihood Right effort Right mindfulness Right concentration 

It is hard to say what "far from nirnava" means since nirvana isn't easily compared to other states of mind. We could say that you are close to nirvana if you reach one of the four stages of enlightenment. Freedom from hatred only occurs at the final stage when you become fully enlightened; however, an Anagami is free from ill-will so any hatred would not cause him to wish harm on any being. These stages of enlightenment are one measure of progress on the path, although they are very advanced levels of progress. 

desire is the driving force even behind the strive for awakening and nibbana, the difference is that it's a NOBLE and a WHOLESOME desire, leading towards goals of corresponding quality and ultimately beyond the desire itself, whereas worldly desires are and do the direct oppostite compassion is genuine as much as our mental hindrances and defilements are gotten rid off, the further one is positioned on a spiritual path the more refined and sublime their wholesome qualities are compassion, being a wholesome and a noble quality, is certainly to be cultivated 

i think Wikipedia articles on the man and on the Dalit emancipation movement give some insight into his reasons $URL$ $URL$ they appear to be primarily socio-political rather than existential and spiritual 

actually everything is in the suttas and for the purpose of the answer Buddhism i equate with Buddhadhamma, not sure what meaning the inquirer imparts it 

Paticcasamuppadavibhanga sutta ( SN 12.2) i think ignorance covers nescience of the phenomenon of suffering and the way of escape from it 

An idea of the core teachings of Buddha can be derived from the Maha Parinibbana Sutta...the teachings before his final nibbana. In the sutta, the Blessed One says, 

This site 'Buddhist Texts' says that while Mahayana schools revere Tipitaka as holy texts, they add many other sutras, the most famous being the 'Lotus Sutra' and the 'Heart Sutra'. My question is how important are Tipitaka in Mahayana schools. One may gauge its importance based on: 

Since your question arose after reading the article, I guess it is essential to point out some misrepresentations in it. First of all, the premise of this secular article is entirely false. Asaram Bapu is a Hindu self-styled Godman, who himself is jailed on charges of child molestation. The details of his case can be accessed here Asaram Child Abuse. Second, the idea that, and I am paraphrasing the author, Indians are joining similar violence prevention courses over the advice of religious opponents who echo Buddha, is entirely author's misconstrued imagination with no basis in reality. Buddha never figured in the contemporary discussion on sexual abuse in India post the December 2012 gangrape. Third, the Buddhist society in general can be divided in 4 different categories: a. Bhikkhu (Male Monks) b. Bhikkhuni (Female Monks) c. Upasak (Lay Male Follower) d. Upasika (Lay Female Follower) The 'Kakacupama Sutta' mentioned in the article is addressed to the monks who have renounced lay life and are determined and dedicated to the path of enlightenment. Its quotation is out of context. It is important to note that Buddha never discouraged Kings (Govts in the modern context) from keeping a standing army. In fact, he even gave advice to the Licchavis on how to well defend their republic. A detailed explanation of the role of King and the Soldier in the society and their importance is given here: Role of the Soldier with proper references of the relevant Suttas. From the above link, it is quite clear that the idea of Radical Pacifism as 'You may not hurt others, even if you're "being rendered limb from limb".' is not what Buddha taught in the context of Kings and Soldiers. This was a teaching given to monks. This might be a little off-topic but it is important to understand that in Buddhism, a lot of emphasis is put on meditation. The Dhamma says 'Ehipassiko' - i.e. come and see for yourself. So, on a personal level, if a soldier comes to realize the effects of his livelihood on the experiential level, he is welcome to become a monk. But while being a soldier, if he is practicing the teachings of monks, then he is harming himself and he will harm the nation. Buddha gave the Noble Eightfold Path to come out of suffering. Now coming to: '•In countries like Cambodia (97% Buddhists) and Thailand (93% Buddhists) does radical pacifism have any consequences at all at the government level? •Or is (radical) pacifism just an insignificant minority position in Buddhism? ' Now, since, Buddha never taught Radical Pacifism to Kings and Soldiers, I think the question is a non-issue. Also, even if the majority of population is Buddhist doesn't mean the state is Buddhist. In Cambodia, during the Cambodian Genocide, religion was banned and there was repression of even the Buddhists. Even during the rule of Mao in China, religion was heavily repressed. Japan had a pacifist constitution for a while before Abe but that was inspired by the second world war. I think a better question would be impact of Buddhism on general governance in different countries. 

i think it depends on the attitude and the frame of mind a care to keep in mind the fact that it's a business of maintaining fitness of a frail and mortal bag of bones and impurities may negate the tendency of the attachment to body and self-association with it to become stronger, which such type of activity in my opinion is prone to foster but if one IS a Buddhist they must be able to skilfully counteract that tendency in any case the motive for going to gym for a Buddhist should not be improvement of bodily appearance but rather health considerations in the frame of mind along the lines of the attitude to eating recommended for monks in the suttas 

human trafficking is not the same as slave employment or exploitation i think Dhammic view at this practice could be likened to the Dhammic view upon meat consumption: if a person wasn't provided as a slave specifically to another person, the slave buyer or owner doesn't incur fault i'm speaking from the point of view of a person accustomed to slavery as a norm, personally i don't advocate or justify it 

Here I am listing some useful resources for an introduction to Vipassana as taught by S. N. Goenka in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin: 

This happens to me all the time...My mom has the habit of inviting over my aunty to the house and with her come her children and grandchildren and there goes a round of joy and laughter all day long...Suminda has given a very nice advice of being mindful of the sound and not reacting...This is the best but a long haul solution to the problem...I am trying it and it is giving results. For the short term, I would advise you to check their schedule...Now they must be sleeping at some point of time...This is you Golden Chance...Squeeze out 1 hour from that duration and carry on your practice. Also since they have disapproved of your practice, I would advise that save your practice from undue negative attention of theirs and let your behaviour speak for you practice. Also you could try Walking Meditation. 

to the best of my familiarity with the Canon, outside of clear instructions for laity regarding 3 ways of skillful bodily action 

From T.W. Rhys Davids, Appendix to Chapter 10 of 'Buddhist India' Putnam, 1903. $URL$ [The list] represents the probable order in which the extant Buddhist documents of this period were composed. They were not yet written, and a great deal has no doubt been lost. 

although to my knowledge this view isn't attested for anywhere, i think this custom has also an aspect of inculcating a sense of moderation, modesty and knowing one's limits in getting free rides the monastics obtain their meals for free as donations, just one meal is a great gift and act of generosity, because lay people aren't obliged to feed monastics expecting to be fed for free trice a day for instance would be impudent of monastics as it would put more strain on the lay community resources
