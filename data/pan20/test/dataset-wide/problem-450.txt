The major weak points will be tendons and blood flow. Yes, stronger bones will be good and should be part of the mix. Stronger muscles are necessary but they can be trained. However, the tendons tend to be the weak point as they can tear away from the bones or just snap. They must be strengthened and more strongly anchored to the bone. None of that is important if you can't get the blood in the feet back up to the heart so it can be sent back around. We should take a page from elephants. The tegument/skin of their feet and lower legs is much stronger than ours. It acts as compression socks so the movement of the muscles of the foot and leg can more efficiently pump the blood back up to the heart. 

They wouldn't need to control the birth process to gain control. They wouldn't even need to enter combat directly. The minimum they would need is to be able to "buff" or heal the fighters. If they could increase the strength of speed of their fighters (presumably men) then their tribe would be more likely to win battles. If they can heal the fighters, they will be less damaged from the battle and have a better chance of winning the next battle. Just using this strategy, A tribe with women who could wield magic would spread its influence. Since the women are responsible for the easier victories, their influence would rise over time. The tribe with the happiest women would be the one with the most support. 

I don't think a prehensile tail has enough dexterity to do much. Most animals that have prehensile tails just use them for holding onto branches. I would have the prehensile tails hold onto overhangs, freeing the forepaws for use in delicate work. Also, what do you get with a furred creature working at a forge? The lovely smell of burnt fur. Though that won't be the only issue. They don't have the body mass to swing a hammer hard enough to work iron or steel. Silver, gold, or copper? Yes. Bronze or brass? Maybe. They would need the body mass of at least a jaguar (probably more) to hammer steel without mechanical help. Now, for building design... Castles would have to have very smooth outer walls if they want to do anything other than just slow down the enemy. I think that there will be very few stairways. They might just use angled logs. For up only, they could use vertical logs but cats have a hard time going down those. One defensive possibility would have vertical logs on the inside of a wall. that would allow defenders to quickly reach the top of the wall but attackers will have a hard time getting down. The defenders could then have ramps in the city that can be brought to the wall when danger is over to allow easy egress. Make sure that nothing is within jumping distance of the wall. 

Military or police services. I'm surprised no one mentioned this. Take the 20mm cannon from an A-10 Warthog and fit it with a stock, trigger and backpack for the ammo belt. Give them a shield, the 20mm and point them at the enemy. Maybe also give them an axe or pick so they can deal with nearby armored vehicles. I suspect that many IEDs will simply make an armored giant mad. 

Great Danes fill most of your requirements. They can be very protective. I don't know how good of a "sniffer" they are but they are smart enough to tell a threat (zombie or scum bag) from their body language. They are also big and have the body mass and height advantage to knock someone over and pin them. Their jaws are pretty strong if that's needed but I agree with RonJohn that I'd rather not have my dog bring zombie cooties back with him. I don't know if it was just ours or if it is a general breed thing but mine was really quiet. I remember a time when I was in the yard with Puppy (ironic name) when a stranger tried to open the back gate. Puppy just sat himself on the other side of the gate, looked the stranger in the eyes (sitting they almost had the same eye level), and showed his teeth. Not a sound. The stranger decided that he had other things to do that day. Puppy was no longer in a playing mood and spent a while walking the fences. 

I think that terrain will get in the way more than the curvature of the earth. So do what you would do to get over local obstacle. Place them on mountain tops with a semaphore system from mountain to base. Invent hot air balloons and use those as your communications links. 

As a general rule, trade happens when someone has something that is more valuable to you than what you currently have. Money ($$ or gold pieces) is simply a place holder for that value. So, yes, people will sell very valuable things if they need what they are getting more. Most high value trades will likely be barter or "in kind" trades since the gold piece count gets pretty silly. The society might have another value placeholder that is the value of 10,000 pieces of gold that could be used in these kinds of trades. Or they could use bank notes if there was any institution that is trusted enough for those to have any value. 

This is almost exactly what happened to an old Champions character of mine. A wormhole got into Tim. How? It was drifting through space and finally moved through enough matter to stop within Tim. The other end of the wormhole is within an energy source which gives it enough energy to hold itself open. This wormhole doesn't produce a lot of energy (most if it is used to maintain the wormhole). Normally, a person would slowly cook from the energy that gets through. However, Tim is special and he somehow creates energy channels and force fields from this energy to keep it from destroying him (allowing enough energy to nourish his cells). His body also feeds some of the energy back into the wormhole expanding the other side if the wormhole. This causes more energy to pour through and instigates a spiral feedback (channels and force field get stronger, allowing more energy to come through, etc.). This all happens internally with no one (possibly even Tim) knowing that it is happening. Then some event pops the force field and he blows up a small area (car, room, etc.). He must then concentrate to restore the force field and gets it back. That does not stop the power build up. So, every time his force field is penetrated, the explosion is bigger than the last time. Tim may or may not be able to make pinhole openings in the force field to use the energy in a more directed manner. By the time anyone figures out what it happening, Tim is the only one who can restore a force field that is strong enough to hold the energy in. If he gets startled, the force field loses some power. The amount and duration of the force field drop depends on how badly he was startled and how long it takes for him to pull himself back together. 

Steps 1 & 2 probably happen simultaneously. Step 5 happens continuously throughout through looting, food riots, etc. I put it last because some people have stores of canned goods and they will last until the cans run out or someone takes their cans away. The survivors will be microbes. This is kind of been there, done that for them. And cockroaches, they'll at least survive longer than us. 

Create catch basins in areas of high rainfall and aqueducts and canals to transport it. Then bless them to make them holy. Heck, if the Pope could declare the nutria (beaver) in Quebec and capybara in Venezuela to be fish so they could eat it on Fridays during Lent (Scientific American), there's not much else they can't justify. In southeast Asia, satellite photos have identified a large number of overgrown catch basins and man made water collection pools from previous civilizations. Looking that up may give you more ideas for your civilization. Another method would be to have every building build catch basins on their roofs as a show of faith. Of course, the basins would have to be properly blessed (for $$$) and the rainwater donated so it could be distributed by the church. 

NASA is working on an EM drive that uses the pressure of microwaves to move forward. If that works at all, it won't produce a lot of thrust. What you describe is like the hand waved Star Trek "Impulse Engines." If you posit that then your drive works. If you don't want to hand wave it that much, you are out of luck. In order to convert your downward motion into energy, you would have to have something to act against. 

There is always the possibility that the planet once had continents. At one point Earth had 1 big continent and shallow seas. The archipelago planet could be a several million year phase the planet is going through. Another possibility is that it is a water world with or without plate tectonics. It is theorized that before Earth got hit by the planetoid that created the Moon, Earth was a water world. Volcanoes would likely happen even without plate tectonics, just no ware near the rate we have on Earth. And coral reefs are also a possibility. I would bet that in the second scenario, any intelligent live would be amphibians. Too much tech involves fire. Having islands would allow for smelting and most of the tech that we know. In the first scenario, I don't know that there would be time for intelligent life to form unless it represents the survivors of whatever caused the continents to disappear. 

There would be no need to drift from English on a whole since everyone can speak it. They may pick up words from the other languages though since other languages have words for concepts or feelings that aren't directly mapped into English but English, as a language has been doing that for a long time now. So, it would be more of the same. If you know a non-English language and know words that would work better in a space setting that some that we already have, stick them in. Also, ask around for people who natively speak the other languages you will have on your station for words that they think fit situations better than the English equivalent. I can't give an absolute here but, typically, people with science and engineering training are all about precision of thought and precision of language. They have no problem making up words that more precisely define a new concept (usually out of Latin but not exclusively). This goes against a general trend to make language simpler and faster (just look at modern slang, "meh" as an example). Any long, often repeated, process will end up being described in 1 or 2 words related to some part of the process. So, you will have two opposing trends: making the language more complex/precise and making the language simpler/faster. For example: if the bulkhead doors all have a small port that can be opened that will make a whistling sound if there is a pressure difference (ie: pressure leak) and everyone is trained to always check the whistle port before opening an bulkhead door (and they are smart enough to have a lot of bulkhead doors in the station), the language may pick up a term like "whistle through to..." when talking about going through one or more bulkheads since checking the port for pressure leaks is so important for the safety of everyone.
