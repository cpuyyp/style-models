Sir, when I talk to my wife over phone (maintaining equanimity) she suddenly recognize that either i am not in a mood to talk, and its obvious becuase even I know that its impossible to remain equanimous and get involved in the conversation whole heartedly, I am not sure I am making myself clear. My question is lets say I often make jokes on phone and laugh a lot when I talk to my friend, but I find these things stupid while trying to maintain Equanimity. Kindly explain is it possible to do both the things? 

I saw in Indian T.V. serial Buddha saying that if hatred rises then know that you are far from Nirvana, is it true? Is there any other way Buddha described a way where one can see his current position in the journey to nirvana? 

When we are in deep sleep our mind (chitt) doesn't get prana from self(soul, energy) and in result we do not remember anything, just nothingness. But as soon as we are not in deep sleep, our chitt (which actually has the memory of each and every past lives), which in result gives us Dejavu. The paradoxical point now is a blind man never saw dreams, a deaf being would never listen in dream(he will only see). I think it also depends on our perception, i have seen a girl who can see with closed eyes. 

For E.g. We often see some small children are interested in different activities, Which is a result of the impression of previous lives on their mind. While you are in deep sleep, mind doesn't get energy from soul, which means you are not aware of sleep. But as soon as mind gets the light of soul, it will start working and you will see dreams (you will still love your family in dreams, because Buddha said "You become, what you think"). So Yes, Love is real but you don't take it to next life the way you perceive it. Yes attachment leads to Suffering. 

I have observed one thing, when i meditated first time Vipassana last week, i saw vibrations in my body, but after that day its been many days i have not seen them, in-fact i can not sit for long (only 15-20 minutes), its not that my legs hurt, But its my mind, it says “Why are you doing this, lets sleep, when i tell it no, it says its more comfortable to meditate in sleep”. and then i sleep, How do i control it, am i missing something ? 

Yesterday I was practicing Vipassana, In starting I observed everything as neutral, then everything was positive, then after 30 minutes, my left leg started hurting badly, i observed it as just negative for 5-7 minutes, then i was thinking am i observing this pain, or am i bearing it ?, whats the difference ? then i gave up.   I could not move my left toe every single time, after Vipassana, i sit in Sukhasan.  Kindly help and suggest me for betterment. 

In quantum physics states every atom is impermanent. Same is taught by Buddha. Apart from that there is quantum entanglement which means if two atom or particles are entangled than it doesn't matter how far they are if you make any changes to one another changes automatically, Buddhism teaches this in Mettā Meditation. Buddha was able to see every atom of his body was continuously coming to existence and dying at the same time, giving you the illusion that we are alive. He told (10 to the power 21) times an atom is coming to existence every second, which is very similar to quantum physics. The actual question should be about the difference, Which we need to understand is Panya (Pragya in Hindi, Maybe experiential knowledge in English) When one find's the Quantum truth by Physics one would still remain as same person, but if one reaches to same truth by Mind, one become Buddha.(Buddha is a person who has his Bodhi(Realization), Which means you will become self realized). 

First for all I know that the correct Sanskrit word is धर्म (pronounced as Dharma) same goes with Nibbana (Nirvana, निर्वाण in Sanskrit) as Siddharth was born in India. So either Pali is just a local dialect as people in Nepal region are not able to pronounce R र. Same goes with native English speaker they roll R, I mean when we say car in India our tongue vibrates, which doesn’t happen with Native english speaker. Why do we use Dhamma instead of Dharma? 

I have been trying to tie mind with breathe lately and successful several times through the day. But today I have fever, and I am finding it very difficult to observe, I just want to this feeling of weakness to be over, I know it is not permanent, But yes one more thing i realized today, the importance of healthy body, My friend suggested me not to take medicine as it is also my Sankara (to me its very stupid.) He also explained that human body raises it temperature to kill some bacteria and by taking medicine you will stop its process. Should I not take medicine in fever and just observe what is happening inside. I want to keep following the Shila's and not also get rid of fever. 

I have been trying to find my passion for last many years, to be honest I do not even know how should I try to find my passion. Though I have been practicing meditation for last couple of years (not punctually though), but I think meditation doesn't help me find my passion. If any one have read "POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY - HAPPIER BY TAL BEN-SHAHAR" In short the book talks about 4 type of Burger: 1 RATRACE: means those who eats a vegetarian normal burger and suffer for anticipated gain in future, which never happens. 2 NIHILISM: This burger is both bad in taste and not even good for health, means worst living style. 3 HEDONISM: This burger is only tasty but not good enough for health means i like watching videos on YouTube but it doesn't have any future. 4 HAPPINESS: This burger is both tasty and good for health means one loves doing something and also have a bright impact on future. So everyone want to eat the 4th burger, Can anyone help me find. 

When Loard Buddha saw his previous lives, He observed that what ever he practices in previous lives was affecting his mind in positive way (because of his Good karma’s).  How ever if one is practicing Bad Karma’s would result in your mind becomes dirty, which will take more time to become pure.   We are born with 3 things  

I want to know what is the right age for a child to learn meditation, for example if i do anapana with a toddler, can it stop the development or it will help the child to stay into panya later. vipassana courses starts from 8 year old, but that may be due to another reasons, but personally i think i can teach my daughter as soon as possible. At the time she is less than 3 months old, and she had started making sounds, i know it doesnot make any sense, but this is the age when infant start to learn and copy things right? I think if i act like i am breathing my daughter will stop copying me in coming months, so doing anapana could be good or bad for her ? 

If you are happy, you will have to face sorrow right? So I am being told to just observe everything with equanimity or Anapana. TBH which is very boring So I observed that instead of thinking of everything leads to sorrow in this world, why not enjoy this moment. (Is is necessary to keep observing when you are happy.) After all we want Nirvana because we are looking for a being in a state of something eternal, Which is equanimity. According to me Equanimity is not happiness for sure. In this Video Philosopher and writer Jim Holt says we can't live like dead humans as per Buddhism and think like a western. I have experienced intoxication occasionally and I was in to Anapana for nearly a week and I have kept myself safe from any kind of intoxication for a year, everything was going smooth breathing while walking, lying, sitting, talking not always but I was satisfied with my pace of being aware. But this weekend I had nothing to do and suddenly a teeny tiny thought arises which says to get drunk and at the same time one of my friend said the same thing and we get drunk. I was still trying to figure out what is happening in mind, Why I am feeling different now. I know I should not be drinking is there anyway I can punish myself. I was actually scared of getting attacked by mind when alone. It attacked. Should i keep in doing Anapana as i believes that it cuts your Karmic chain for the moment. 

I was wondering its not much difficult to sit for one hour in meditation, but i want to know in Vipassana 10 days course, How long one will have to meditate, i mean do they do split meditation of 1 hour several times a day or 3-4 hours of continuous meditation ?
