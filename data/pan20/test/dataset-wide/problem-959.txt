From an aerial view just off the island of Mauritius, there is what appears be an underwater waterfall. The picture below illustrates this visual phenomenon: 

It is well known among regular beach goers that a sudden shoreline drawback is often a warning sign for an impending Tsunami. My understanding of Tsunamis is they they form as a result of the seafloor abruptly changing, causing a local vertical displacement of water at the site of above the disruption, which initiates the wave. 

Snowflakes are known to form into pretty hexagonal structures. The image below shows a variety of such structures that are possible (although by all means not an exhaustive list): 

The Coriolis force predicts that winds in the northern hemisphere should be deflected in a clockwise pattern and winds in the southern hemisphere should be deflected in an anti-clockwise pattern. Why is it that in the case of cyclones however, the cyclones spin anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere? 

It is well known that the jet stream follows an overall meandering pattern, but what is less well known is that this meandering pattern itself moves as a wave with a velocity much slower than the velocity of the jet stream itself. So why does this meandering wave propagate, and what causes the meandering pattern in the first place? 

Bit puzzled why it appears that seismic travel times from one location to another appears to just be a function of the distance, and not any other factors. 

Looking for a historic record of the average temperature on Earth going back millions of years, and this 2002 graphic the from the PALEOMAP Project is currently the best I am able to find. Is it accurate, and if so, why? If it is not accurate, is there a graph that is? 

Clouds on Venus After a quick search, it appears the clouds found on Venus are different than Earth's: 

Fundamentals of atmospheric modeling show that the height of the tropopause depends on the location, notably the latitude, and that the troposphere is roughly 8km higher at the equator than the poles depending on the time of year. First guess was that the temperature of the would impact its density (for example, here's the data for -50° and 50° c) - though this does not appear to show the cause of why is the troposphere 8km higher at the equator than the poles. Why is the troposphere 8km higher at the equator than the poles? 

The Earth's inner core is solid because despite the enormous temperature in this region, there is also enormous pressure there, which in turn raises the melting point of iron and nickel to a value above the Earth's core temperature. Now as we move out from the solid inner core, temperature drops, and pressure also decreases. Obviously because the inner core is solid but the outer core is liquid, we must conclude that the drop in temperature vs the drop in pressure must be lower than the gradient of 16 degrees/GPa shown in the diagram below (link to source), given that at the outer-core temperature has exceeded the melting point of iron/nickel, which is a function of pressure. In other words, the drop in pressure must be quite significant compared to the drop in temperature as radius increases from the core. 

In the theory of tectonic plates, at a convergent boundary between a continental plate and an oceanic plate, the denser plate usually subducts underneath the less dense plate. It is well known that oceanic plates subduct under continental plates, and therefore oceanic plates are more dense than continental plates. My question is why are the oceanic plates always denser than the continental plates. I'm aware that the difference in density can be attributed to the plates differing compositions, but what I'm interested in is why these plates have different composition in the first place giving rise to their relative difference in densities. 

Supervolcanos have occurred in the recent geological past, but not within the past 74,000 years. Is it possible to find the magma chambers with no previous history of supervolcanic activity that are likely to produce supervolcanos? 

Venus appears to be the closest to Earth in mass, density, size, etc. - though they clearly have different atmospheres. Why do Earth and Venus have different atmospheres? 

Few things to notice are that while the Arctic Sea volume increased 50%, the volume increase was marginal compared with the volume of sea ice in 1979. Next, if you review the graph below, one year spikes are not that unusual, though if there was another 50% the volume increase from 2013 to 2014, it would be of note, given the rarity of significant year over year increases in Arctic Sea volume. 

Seems like the Earth Day related crowd sourcing project to create the first global soundscape by encouraging smartphone owners around the world to download and use an app developed to record the sounds around them is interesting, though it's unclear what scientific value it would have. Is there any scientific value to understanding soundscapes on a global basis? 

Is it true that Earth's outercore rotates in the opposite direction to Earth's inner-core? Is there a plausible explanation for why this phenomenon occurs and what is the available evidence supporting this notion? 

Below is a picture of a typical sunset that I have been observing lately at an undisclosed location in the Southern Hemisphere: 

As mantle plumes begin in the core and move towards the crust, I would have thought that the heat in the mantle plume would disperse to the surrounding mantle, and the plume would cease to exist by the time it reaches the crust, a large distance away. So how is the mantle plume able to survive with such a localized trajectory on its way from the core of Earth to the crust? 

The image can also be seen from the google maps satellite here. What is responsible for this majestic illusion near the island? I have heard that it may be sand moving over the edge of an underwater cliff, and if so what causes the sand to be pushed off continuously without the process coming to a stop and what is responsible for this unique geographical landscape allowing this to occur? 

CAPTION: Example soil with designations that communicate the soil formation processes occurring in each horizon. 

Nereus as is, is currently not replaceable, but it was insured at a replacement value of $3.1 million, and my understanding Woods Hole currently plans to replace it, though unlikely at this point that there's a solid timeline for this taking place. Landers, fish traps, and sediment core samplers will still be actively used, but again, these are not really comparable to the areas of research that Nereus was able to cover. UPDATE: These appears to be the last log entry for the Kermadec Trench 2014 expedition, and the official statement on the day of the event. 

According to the graph below, which appears to be sourced from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more tornadoes happen late in the day - why is this? 

Answer is no, Earth not an organism. Key reason being that life without reproduction is not life, and there is no logical proof that Earth reproduces using a type of reproduction never observed, or is proof that life does not require reproduction. 

If radioactive decay supplies only about half the Earth’s heat, what are the remaining sources of heat? 

75% of the world's tornadoes occur in the USA, and within the USA these tornadoes are most likely to occur in particular regions of the country, such as the well known "tornado alley". The diagram below shows tornado activity in various parts of the USA, from 1950 to 1998. It can be seen from the diagram below that most tornadoes occur on the Eastern half of the country. Within this half of the country, there are regions with much greater tornado activity than others, highlighted in dark red in the diagram below, and includes the so called "tornado alley". Why is there a higher frequency of tornadoes in these regions compared to other regions of the USA and around the world? 

The enlightening image below is of a lightning strike slowed down at 10,000 frames per second. It can be seen that the most intense flash produced from the lightening occurs in the direction from the ground up. Why does this final "ground-up" strike occur and why is it so much brighter and faster than the initial part of strike heading towards the ground? 

Question: Assuming that mantle plumes remain in fixed locations relative to one another at the core, is there any known pattern for how these mantle plumes are distributed relative to one another (or to fixed landmarks, e.g. axis of rotation), or do they appear to be distributed randomly? 

Curious if to what degree it is possible to cluster epicentres as originating from a single formation/fault? Seems like it is possible that apart of the issue might being able to map the hypocentre of a faults slope, but what is not clear is if that is true, or if faults are really more a collections of formations that vary and at a high-level behave as one, but often independently behave when reviewed on a small scale due to the formations local attributes. Which leads to my real question, what is a fault? 

Since reliable modern records of climate only began in the 1880s, proxies provide a means for scientists to determine climatic patterns before record-keeping began, though it appears that the the distribution of proxy records for global average temperatures, just like the instrumental record, is strongly non-uniform, with more records in the northern hemisphere. How accurate are climate proxies in giving us a clear picture of global average temperatures throughout Earth history? 

Though this graph from the ESA’s CryoSat satellite show that the volume of Arctic sea ice increased 50% from 2012 to 2013: 

Possible this is not what you need, but here's an archive of the Guidelines for Construction of CF Standard Names, which is "Version 1, 3 December 2008" and was cached on July 28, 2013; guessing that the page has not been updated since December 2008. Also, the source code repository for CF Conventions website you linked to (cf-convention.github.io) is viewable from here; if you had questions about the status of the site, you might try contacting the developer listed on Github for the project; their email is listed on their Github profile. UPDATE: Here's the contact info for the CEDA Data Scientist; their "main role in CEDA is the development of metadata standards, particularly the CF (Climate and Forecast) metadata conventions." 

How does this process ultimately result in the shoreline often receding prior to the Tsunami reaching the coast? 

We all know that as waves approach the shallow shores, the waves begin to form a characteristic shape. The upper portion of these breaking waves appears to curl forward and downwards over the bottom segment of the wave, before breaking into "white wash". The image below illustrates what this characteristic shape looks like: 

So how is it that pressure drops off fast enough relative to temperature to give rise to the liquid outer-core. A good answer will explain how temperature drops off with radius and how pressure drops off with radius and how these compare to give rise to the liquid outer-core. 

Interesting question. I think many issues of self-regulation and so forth have been addressed but what is really up for debate is whether the Earth can reproduce. I answer with yes it is possible the Earth is an organism because it is possible for it to reproduce. Through intelligent life that is able to develop technology, this life is able to reproduce the Earth (assuming living creatures are part of the Earth - like cells of the Earth). We can think of the inanimate features of the Earth (e.g. atmosphere) like the blood of the organism that must supply the right Milieu intérieur for it's cells, the living creatures of the Earth. The humans are analogous to the planets sex cells, because through humans, the most intelligent of Earth's species, the Earth is able to replicate itself through technology in the ways listed below: There are two potential ways that humans can be used to replicate the Earth. The first way, is that because humans have adapted to fit in with the inanimate features of the Earth, if humans are to inhabit another existing planet, they must transform this planet into another Earth with the same properties of the Earth, that are compatible with human life, in order for that planet to be suitable for them. Humans have evolved to be suited the Earth's conditions, and therefore any planet they wish to inhabit must have these same features of Earth. It is a neat method of reproduction - evolve a species to need you, so it will later be forced to reproduce you. This effectively replicates the Earth. The second way humans could replicate the Earth is directly producing another planet that has the same features of Earth using technology. While at present we have no record of living creatures having replicated a planet it is certainly plausible, and therefore it is plausible that the Earth is a living organism, given that it is possible for it to reproduce and self regulate through negative feedback mechanisms observable in nature.
