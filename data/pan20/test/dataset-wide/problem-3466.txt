Nice question! I would like to add a few elusive ones that I think are important. Natural selection does not require intelligence. It is more of a biology theory, but its economic implications are vast. Evolution of cooperation is very useful but often ignored by economists and politicians as it goes against some common sense rules. The entire theory of probability is counter-intuitive and has plenty of traps in economics for those who use only common sense. One example is a Monty Hall paradox: once you made your decision with limited information, you will gain by changing your decision when you get more information. A common fallacy of "throwing good money after bad" stems from ignoring this principle. Literally everyone has been guilty of it. 

GDP growth would lead to deflation if the money supply remained unchanged. The government usually increases money supply as the economy grows to avoid deflation. Controlling money supply is not an easy task though because the economy responds with lag to every policy decision. But ideally, the government aims at keeping inflation low (1-4%) and avoiding deflation. Zero inflation is also undesirable because if you know your money will be worth just as much a year from now, you have less incentive to invest. 

If it is about European Union, it would make sense to look at austerity as a response to the debt crisis. I would measure austerity not as the level of government debt, but as the change in levels of government debt from year to year. The slower the government debt (as a share of GDP) increases, the more austere are the budget policies of that country. Also, if you have access to state budget deficits data, it would be a very convincing measure of austerity in my opinion. The less is the budget deficit, the more austere is the budget policy. 

Tight monetary policy reduces the amount of money available in the economy and strengthens the currency. It is usually implemented by raising interest rates, increasing capital requirements for banks, or sometimes selling government bonds. When there is less money and credit to go around, business activity slows down, economic growth slows down. Businesses that could have expanded by taking out loans do not do so; consumers who could have purchased more with their credit cards can't do so; investors who could have invested more money into businesses (equities) put the money into government bonds. 

[I can't possibly compete with the credentials of Brian Romanchuk so I write this answer simply to continue the discussion.] Isn't there an argument based on maturity transformation? Maturity transformation is that process by which banks create long terms loans from short term deposits. So, equity share price analysts will take about how a steeper yield curve is good for the profits of banks because banks pay interest at a 90-day rate whilst making loans at a longer rate, say 10yr on average (think of a mix of 5yr personal loans and up to 30 yr mortgages). When the yield curve flattens, i.e. when long rates minus short rates falls then making loans becomes less profitable. If the yield curve inverts and shorter rates are more expensive than longer rates then (ceterus paribus) what is the incentive for banks to make an unprofitable loan? Further, at any given time loans are being paid off and loans are being created, if there is a cessation of new loans whilst old loans are being paid off then one can see how there will be a drop in M3 (the higher money supply indicators). This is capital shallowing aka. disinvestment and that would (could?) cause a recession. So there are issues with this theory. Loans do not take place at the risk free rate, each borrower pays a rate higher based on counterparty risk. Other factors include corporate strategy where one bank intends to drive competitors out of business with deliberately predatory (and unprofitable) pricing. That is why I added ceterus paribus in the italicised paragraph above. This is my pet theory; I have not read it in a textbook. Yield curve flattening and potential yield curve inversion arises recurrently on business television but they hardly ever explain the transmission mechanism to a recession (if one exists). Recently, I heard one economist propose my theory on Bloomberg but he was disputed by another economist, so this is not orthodox economics view. I'd love to know the real answer. UPDATE: In this interview with Bloomberg Ray Dalio says a "flatter yield curve causes a constraint in the economy and a constraint in lending" ~4:10 to ~4:50. UPDATE2: New Fed Chair Jerome Powell in his first press conference says the effects of inverted yield curve on inter-mediation are hard to find in the research data but nonetheless those are issues that they'll be watching carefully. 

I'm not really sure what you're asking, but I'll try to answer what I think the question is. In an equity market, people trade certain financial assets. The first point is, trading these assets on a secondary market is not consumption, and it's not investment. If you buy a stock for 100 on NASDAQ, you basically give the previous owner of the stock 100, and you get a piece of paper in return. That piece of paper entitles you to a share of earnings of the company, and that's why you think it's worth something. You can either enjoy the earnings over time, or sell the thing later. So you had $100, and you could have consumed something, or you could have invested it, but you chose to trade that choice to someone else. Now he has to decide whether to consume or invest. In terms of the "real" economy, nothing happens. And nothing happens when you sell that stock. Money never "comes into" the market, and it never "leaves" the market. It just gets transferred between the buyers and sellers, and shares get transferred in the opposite direction. So we see the question of what happens if money can't come into the system doesn't really make any sense. So what do indices reflect? They reflect some kind of expectation of the aggregate value of the shares in an index. That value is the expected discounted streams of earnings of the companies in the index. When the expectations rise, the indices rise. When they fall, the indices fall. Obviously, if we expect inflation, we expect earnings in nominal terms to rise, so that will make the indices rise. But that shouldn't be thought of as "more dollars chasing the same number of stocks." It's purely an earnings effect. The only thing that can make a stock more valuable is if its earnings expectations rise. Supply and demand, as understood in consumer goods markets, do not have much of anything to do with secondary equity markets. Just because people have more money to buy stocks with does not mean anyone will spend 100 dollars to buy a stream of earnings worth 95 dollars. (I say "much of anything". It would make this post too long to go into details, but if there is a surplus of demand for financial assets, risk premiums will drop, and prices will rise. This is a long story for a relatively small effect.) I should mention another reason indices rise, because it's why we expect them to rise faster than economic growth. And that's because there's a selection bias in companies in indices: very poorly performing companies are booted, and more successful up-and-coming companies replace them. 

Sorry if this is a birds and the bees type question. Where does capital come from? And I am not talking human capital (which to my mind is skills basically). I suppose I'm taking about financial capital. So, I think one can create personal capital by choosing not to consume, i.e. save. Also I think retained profits are another (and I was wondering perhaps the ultimate) source of capital. If we look at the capital structure of a company then bank loans, corporate bonds and equity capital are all invested, retained profits are internally generated capital. External corporate capital, to my mind, comes from household savings. I know there is the external sector but can we simplify the problem by excluding this? Let us consider the closed economy only. I suppose I'm asking for a theory of capital. I know Marxists have a view and they are welcome to give an updated view (please no re-hash of nineteenth century economic theory, bring it up to date please). I also think that the Austrian school is critical of Keynesians because the former says the latter have no theory of capital. Need illuminating in the capitalism facts of life. Thanks. I wish there was a tag 'meta-economics' or 'philosophy of economics' to describe this question. 

If the Sterling/dollar exchange before Brexit were used then the three European economies are very close to each at $1800. But the key standout is the USA figure its miles ahead. So I am now wondering why is United States Gross Capital Formation per capita so far ahead of the big 3 European economies? 

So, I was pondering the weakness of the UK economy (I am British) and its lagging productivity performance. I was thinking that capital deployed per worker would be an explanatory variable. Looking at figures from www.tradingeconomics.com: Gross Fixed Capital Formation data : Germany |United Kingdom|France|United States. Dividing through by population (proxy for working population) I get the following per capita figures 

Do the proponents of free globalised trade expect the price of labor to converge? Is there evidence of convergence? When will meaningful convergence arrive (example metric EM labor being paid no less than half DM labor)? 

That Mexicans workers get paid less US workers is a dynamic which motivates the moving of production to Mexico. This idea can be abstracted to Developed Markets (DM) labor and Emerging Markets (EM) labor. This is driving many recent political upsets.
