If the demand for loanable funds decreases, investment increases because the real interest rate decreases. Isn't that a contradiction, because loanable funds are used for investment, and a decrease in demand for loanable funds must come from a decrease in investment? 

I would like to find out what goods are compared across countries in the International Comparison Programme in order to calculate purchasing power parities. I know there are possibly thousands of specific types of products that are looked at, but I just want to get an idea of what the products are or to look at a list of the products. Please link to the source. 

The straight-line supply and demand curves can be thought of as a magnification of this graph, where the two intersect. Thus, the units on the axes would give you a clue as to how high up the graph is being drawn, or how far to the right (if the units start at a number other than 0 or skip an interval). This shows you why they are indeed called 'curves', even when they are sometimes straight lines. Supply and demand curves are drawn using straight lines for simplicity. For example, two straight-line equations may be given, from which it is relatively simple to calculate the point of intersection. In the real world Supply and demand curves are an approximation of what happens in real life. The curves are a simplified model which show the general trend in the two functions. In reality, supply and demand curves are approximated using data that is collected over many years, with many short-term variables affecting the results, if the curves are even drawn up at all (the curves are more a theoretical model than a calculative method). Economic factors which affect supply and demand 

You could find it by using your table to build a graph and interpolating the quantity that matches the maximum profit. Note: At this price of 7 Euro your firm should exit the market, as it is under in every point in this table, the minimal loss is -900 either for 100 or 200 units of its product, thus the answer to your question is units = 150. It will profit if it continues to grow, as its Average Total Cost is decreasing and the firm still benefits from economies of scale. 

In a debate concerning long term economic strategy, a representative of a left party was trying to support that privatisation and Small Government which minimizes its own activities is not a viable direction in a Global Economy, i.e. it will lead to a further loss of sovereignty in a sense that a country applies its policies mostly via the public sector, which if minimized will have insignificant impact. Then the opponent asked a simple, but intriguing question: "Is there an example where a government owned company1 has a product that is competitive with a product of a private company?" After a brief research I really couldn't find such example. Is there such an example and if not, what counter argument there could be presented against the above question? 

Reading my development economics textbook, I was informed that the opportunity cost of a private investment is the market value of the wages, goods and services used for the investment. Here's a hypothetical situation: suppose that the firm could invest in an alternative project with the same amount of resources but a higher return. Would it not be myopic to overlook this alternative investment when asserting that the opportunity cost is the market value of inputs? It leads me to wonder why the inputs weren't valued higher. It could be because others in the market don't have access to capital, knowledge of the opportunity or the expertise required to make the investment. Still, why would the opportunity cost not be the income that could potentially be created from the alternative investment? Is a 'market value' approach just a simplification? 

My guess is that the ''elasticity of substitution'' means something like$$\frac{\%\Delta K}{\% \Delta L}=\mathrm{mrs} \times\frac lk, $$ but that is dependant on what point you are at (i.e. a coordinate $(l, k)$). To get $\mathrm{mrs} $, find $\frac {\mathrm d k} {\mathrm d l} $, and even that is dependent on the value of $f$. 

You mention factory jobs and assembly lines. Firstly, let us think if the large part of these kind of jobs were supposed to be for human beings at all. What I mean for human beings is, are these jobs utilizing, for example, creativity, critical thinking, analysis, or any other kind of more deep mental activities that a human being has developed from million years of evolution and is capable of, well the answer is: NO. That is so, because the nature of work was shaped by criteria such as effectiveness, productivity [1] as one can see from the early works on the principles of work management. That was the start of the first industrial revolution and many traditional crafts demanding multilateral personal development and skills from many fields, whose complexity was ensuring a stable place in the market, were exchanged for monotonous work involving few simple moves on the assembly line, that slowly converted man into a machine, making him dispensable, but even worse making him unable to do anything else as his real skills remain undeveloped and his true capacity unutilized, a good example of I mean is Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times": Thus, the jobs that were meant initially for machines are now rightfully being done by machines. But what happens to all these people that don't have jobs and contribute to the high unemployment, which in turn contributes to the lowering of the wages and so on... Just think about it, after two industrial revolutions and some much scientific development instead of less work people need more work ONLY to maintain their basic human needs! Well, it is time for people to claim what they deserve, it is time for radical changes, for example, lowering the 8-hour working day to 4-hour working day, this is already gradually introduced in some countries [2], while keeping the wages the same, in this way one can, not only, double the workforce, not only eliminate unemployment and avoid loosing one more generation of young people, but double the enthusiasm, the time available for spending, travelling, and many other activities that will facilitate the economic growth and well-being. In other words, it is time people demand what is rightfully theirs: right of decent existence, even without a job, i.e. basic income, like for example in Switzerland [3]. Changes should be made in the educational system in order to stop the "production" of professionals with no real prospect for work, but even more important without perspective for meaningful social contribution, i.e. dead-end jobs. Lately thoughts are being expressed in the direction that there is a good chance we end up with a universal basic income due to automation. [4] Finally, once we transition to fully renewable energy production and consumption, the developed part of the world works for helping the rest of the world and closes the gap, which surely will guarantee a lot of future work, people should start doing activities related to their intellectual and spiritual development and aim higher, for reference check the human being named Elon Musk and his view for the future. [5] 

I recommend Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, for this topic. I don't know what you mean by "the society." Diamond makes it clear that there are many different societies around the world, progressing at different rates. To answer your question about why we have what we have today and why individual societies developed in the direction they did: some technologies are inevitable, such as farming, writing and mettalurgy. What differs is that a few societies developed these technologies much earlier than others. Diamond lays out the reasons why; differences in intelligence across races is not a reason but the geology and biogeography of people's habitats are ultimate causual factors. These ultimate factors lead to more proximate factors such as animal and plant domestication, leading to denser and more sedentary populations with more complex political organization. Technological development led to further economic development, with most technology arising from it being spread from other societiesâ€”and that transmission depends again on geography. Eurasia had the advantage of an east-west axis that made transfer of domestic food and animal species easier (along the same lines of latitude and hence similar climes), and thus the technology which accompanies more sedentary societies. More isolated societies such as Australia did not benefit from the spread of technology, and hence remained a hunting-gathering society until European conquest. His book is entertaining and interesting to read. I've learnt facts and a perspective of the differences amongst races that I couldn't do without. 

Update: reflecting the remarks in the comments, a more direct version of the question would be: Is there a legal path through which CETA could act as a back door for TTIP? 

It means that, at the current size of your production capabilities, if you want to produce one more unit of your product, you will have to spend 7 Euro. This, MC value is a quantitative description of the cost you pay if you want to adjust your initial production plan to a larger output and it is determined by your production capacities. Here is an example: You have a bus company and your service is to offer a one way trip from point A to point B, every day at a given hour. Now, your buses have 50 seats and your total cost for the trip is 100 Euro (fuel, road taxes, etc). In addition to that your licence says that you have to provide additional bus if the passengers are more than 50. In this case, if you have 49 passengers and in the last minute there is a reservation for one more seat, your marginal cost is effectively zero, however, if there are two reservations in the last minute and the total number of passengers is now 51, the 51th passenger's marginal cost is 100 Euro, because you need a second bus only for him. 

Elasticities tell economists how responsive changes in price are to changes in quantity, and this is useful because it tells you whether revenue will increase or decrease. Suppose you are the owner if a firm that is interested in expanding. It will be more informative for you to know that if you expand your production by 20%, the prices of your products will decrease by only 10% than to know that if you produce two more units per week, the price will drop by $1.00. The first description is informative because it tells you whether your revenue will increase or not (in this case it will, because demand is price elastic), whereas the second is an absolute reference which requires further calculation in order to understand what it means for your business. 

I would say it exhibits no returns to scale. What follows is a counter argument to the idea that it can exhibit returns to scale. A 'return to scale' means that production will change in response to a change in the input. A 'constant return to scale' is a straight-line function (or a portion thereof) including the origin (0, 0), with the input on the horizontal axis and the output on the vertical axis. That is, a directly proportional relationship. A 'decreasing return to scale' means that, as more and more of the input is used, production changes with a decreasing effect. This means that the graph will have a gradient that gets more and more flat as the input increases. An 'increasing return to scale' means that production changes with increasing effect as the input increases - a function who's gradient increases. In conclusion, if the input has no effect on production, there is no 'return' from the input. 

P.S.: I strongly believe that there is a "critical mass" of people similar to the above mentioned that will contribute towards an Utopian future in which people will explore the mysteries of the Universe rather than burden their soul with issues like job insecurity, which will be a thing of the past. 

It should be noted that crisis recovery is strongly related with the present state and structure of the local, regional and global economy and thereby depends on different parameters, as it works by different rules1. Consequently, I wouldn't consider thinking by analogy, i.e. in terms of historical precedence a valid strategy for problem solution. The problem should be (could be) tackled only in terms of first principles of the economy, in your case in terms of first principles of the EU economy, which will inevitably result in a solution lying outside Greece itself and more specifically in the rebooting of the EU zone and recompilation of the regulations governing it in the direction of a economically (and politically) equal / homogeneous monetary union with surplus recycling mechanisms that assure the financial distribution in the deficit countries in the form of productive investments (that will in turn produce the needed growth), instead of distributions in the form of loans (as in the current situation). 

Another reason why inflation needs to be positive is so that interest rates can be cut in a recession in order to stimulate spending. When interest rates get too low, an economy encounters a liquidity trap and further expansionary monetary policy cannot be implemented. 

For question 1, I think that investment has a demand-side effect on the economy. I think it isn't a supply-side effect because it isn't stated that the investors are responding to a supply-side shock. So I'm saying that AD shifts right. With shifts in the curves, there will be a change in equilibrium. For example, the process you described of both curves shifting right will lead to higher output (even though the price level might not change). That being said, the "foreign" part of the question does make things a little less obvious. Why would the question want to emphasise the foreign part of this investment? An improvement in technology in one firm will eventually trickle to other firms (vertically or horizontally). Technological improvement shifts the supply curve rightwards, but because this is a long-term effect, I did not say in the first paragraph that there is a shift of the supply curve. Also, if a foreign country sends its profit to its home country, there is effectively a small decrease in the demand curve, but on the whole that would be small enough that it would not offset the increase in demand that the investment brings. The second question is obviously trying to highlight a decrease in supply, as you have said. The quantity of labour decreases; production decreases. But... to throw a spanner in the works... this does sort of imply that the workers are consumers. If consumers leave the country, consumption decreases, which decreases aggregate demand (as you have said). One needs to know why the people needed to leave. That being said, with the word "workers" I think the question wanted to highlight the supply side effect.
