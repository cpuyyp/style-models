Both. Many people will be quite excited and want to befriend this entity or to help it. Many will even want it to take robot bodies and join us in our material existence. Many people will be terrified or have other negative reactions. Many people will riot. Many people will call for its destruction. There will be an attempt by some people to completely destroy the internet, whether they are bigots who want to destroy the AI out of hatred or because they fear for our own survival. The answer is "D) All of the above." Personally, I thought it sounded great while I was reading the question until I got to the "We aren't sure if it is being truthful" part. I can tell you that I would be somewhere in the middle, insisting that we do not commit AI-genocide; this AI should have fundamental rights to the pursuit of life and happiness too, and at the same time I would insist that we be very cautious and take precautions to safeguard ourselves. 

If you want a more fantastical, outside-the-box approach, you could suggest that cold-weather trees are so prevalent in your area that people are wasteful with their wood use. People burn long-term fires which rage for months at a time and provide enough heat to grow crops. This practice does not need to be sustainable, perhaps a note in your story that this is a new practice which is deforesting the area, but this is the time that the story is set in. Or maybe it is sustainable because you have either abnormally fast growing trees or very few people. 

26 degrees F = -3 degrees C. Assuming the "cold weather champs" listed above will fare better than the ones in its previous paragraph, that provides a small list of crops that should survive even at -5 C *without any special greenhouse or other intervention." So, with a simple greenhouse, or better, you should be able to keep some of your crops alive even below -5 C, possibly even down to -20C or -30C, more if you provide enough heat inside it. Note that even if a plant does not die that does not necessarily mean that it is still growing, or growing well, at a given temperature. If you grow kale, even if it does not die at -5C it might not grow a reasonable amount until the temperature gets back up to 5-10C or until you warm it. If you design this with solar heaters, it will be even easier and warmer. If your temperature gets down below -5C a lot and your diet is primarily plant based, then you will need to cover a lot of land like this. The amount might seem infeasible to you or I, but if it is necessary to survive then people will do it. It could be difficult but not impossible. If I were given 1 roll of food plastic-wrap in an environment like you specified, I could probably cover enough kale to keep me going for a long time. I think people often underestimate the effect a simple window can have. When we go out in the winter and get into our car on a very cold day, it still feels very cold in the car but what you might not realize is it's still much warmer than outside the car, assuming the windows are not covered by snow or other impediment. If a car is properly oriented to maximize sun exposure to the windows, it can be below freezing out but warm enough in the car to not need a coat. A properly designed greenhouse with all the best fixtures, such as multi-pane glass, good light-absorbing material inside to maximize the heating, and circled by passive solar heaters, could easily raise your temperatures a lot. Source of information note cited: Experience. I have melted snow in ways similar to this specifically to get water from it. I have friends who grow kale through the winter. Usually at least three to four months of the year where I am is much colder than you specify; we consider it a warm day if it reaches the mid-point in your range. Also, I have made a solar heater using nothing but plastic wrap, cardboard, duct-tape, the screen from a door, and a little bit of wood, and even a small crude device like I made noticeably raises the temperature inside it. 

Now to get to the real answer, and let's think of it from the perspective of the Dearth dolphins. As demonstrated above, humans themse-, I mean ourselves, have a similar problem already. There are numerous energies and forces which we cannot directly sense with our organs, and most of the EM energy itself is included in that. In the case of EM though, we have a leg up since we can at least sense part of it, seeing wavelengths from about 400-700nm. Some of the things that humans cannot sense are things that other animals can sense. Take magnetism for example. There are many animals which have a sense that we unfortunately cannot tap into: magnetoreception. It does wonders in helping animals get around. I wonder if the birds looking at our airplanes think "How can those humans possibly have figured out how to fly a plane, and to reach such distant locations accurately nonetheless, when they cannot sense the earth's magnetic field like we can?" I also wonder if the birds can pick up at all on the magnetic fields of the sun or of other celestial bodies; probably not, despite the fact that you can tune in to hear Jupiter's static on a good radio. How did we do it? So, how have humans accomplished the feat of "seeing" energies and forces which we cannot directly see? We hypothesize the existence of something, figure out a way to test it, verify, create devices to detect it, then finally we convert the data into a different format which we can see. Take an EEG graph for example, generated by an electroencephalograph. It is something that we cannot detect without the EEG, but we then turn it into a visual graph as on the linked page. We do the same with devices that create graphs of electrical current and with seismography and many other things. We can view the data in a meaningful way that allows us to act on it almost as if we had sensed it personally. Now, this gets more interesting when we generate full pictures of things we cannot see. A great example of this is with an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Better than the bird's magnetoreception, an MRI allows us to look inside of a person, generally for medical reasons. The below image uses magnets to show us a picture via the EM that our eyes see, but it also has the added benefit that the picture is an fMRI showing an added layer of information (the colored spots) which we can do because we use technology to combine all the data into an image in the format we desire. If you look at the picture below, you will be doing the same thing we are talking about. By observing the picture below, you are looking inside someone's brain by "seeing" magnetism even though you have no biological way to do. 

The Specific Answer The answer is "no solution." This question is based on false premises. There are plenty of people who contribute to StackExchange who believe it is highly flawed. Many people disagree on what actions should be taken ("Is this on-topic or not?" "Should this be on this SE or that SE?" etc.) Many people take the "vote your conscience" thing to weird places that do not help the site. Sometimes whether your question is given "protected" status or "closed" depends on which band of high-rep users happens to be around at the time. Many people who are active in cleaning up the site are more interested in whether your question or answer is technically on-topic than whether it is a good fit for the community or makes StackExchange better or worse. In fact, on some of the SE meta sites when people have asked questions about how to deal with certain types of actions, I have more than once included in my answers statements to the effect of "Ultimately, is your action going to make StackExchange a little bit better or a little bit worse overall? That is more important than a legalist interpretation of the rules." and had such answers yield a total negative score. There is nothing "Utopian" about StackExchange. StackExchange's principles would no more bring about a physical utopia than they have a virtual one, since they haven't. 

I just skimmed all the answers and saw they all predated the recent NASA announcement, so I'm assuming this was not mentioned elsewhere... NASA recently announced the discovery of 7 approximately earth-sized planets orbiting the same star, multiple of them being in the "goldilocks zone" calculation. Remember also that the "goldilocks zone" is only a very rough approximation; though unlikely, it is possible that most of these planets are habitable. You can find one (of the many) articles about this here.
