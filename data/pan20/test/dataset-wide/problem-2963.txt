The root idea of no-self in Buddhism is that your entire process from your physical body to your psychological feelings, to your thoughts, to your intentionality, to your very self is an illusion and the source of your problems. Thus, the point for Buddhists, is not to to step back and observe these (though they may encourage stepping back and observing to realizing the fleetingness and impermanence of these things), because simply stated for orthodox Buddhists, these things don't exist. Or to put it another way the central claim of the no-self doctrine is that there is no I. The I is just a complicated illusion. Thus, some draw parallels between Hume's bundle-theory and Buddhism. And Derek Parfit's view is sometimes called for this reason "Quasi-buddhism" because he denies that there are selves in moral philosophy. 

A third line that I've seen advocated both by parts of $URL$ and by Matthew Scully who as far as I know is not affiliated with them is that we can link the cause of human suffering to animal suffering and view both as inordinately wrong. In other words, the consistent expansion of the second premise to include at least all mammals regardless of condition. 

(If your proof system requires it, you may need to: (1) repeat the assumption at line 1 before line 5. (2) add a conjunction after 7 of 4 and 7 to show the contradiction). 

For Aristotle, none of this abrogates (eliminates) blame. The fact that you're upbringing did not enable you to be ethical doesn't for Aristotle exempt you from the requirement to be ethical. This is one of the harder points to accept in Aristotle and some contemporary virtue ethics seeks to soften this point, but Aristotle's own language is not ambiguous on this point. Put another way, if the task of excellence were to be running a mile in 4:00, then there's only blame if the best you can do is 6:00 and no time to listen to your excuses about why you cannot do it. This is harsh, but Aristotle's ethics doesn't have the same virtues as later Christian and post-Christian ethics. Mercy is not a key value of the ancient Greeks nor is allotment for disabilities or poor upbringing. 

There's two things going on that explain why your answer is insufficient. First, I'll start with an apparent wording problem in your answer: 

would be true. But that's no identical to "it is meaningless to speak ..." To understand why, we need to attend to what Kant means by "know" and "understand." For Kant, understanding is something we bring to our interaction with things. Or to state it more clearly. He thinks there are: 

Kant makes no such argument by which I mean Kant does not identify the categorical imperative with a "phenomenal 'guess.'" For him, the Categorical Imperative is a conclusion of reason and the limitations in his Critique of Pure Reason apply to understanding. To put it another way, on Kant's account, that the CI is written in a book is trivial. That the argument for the CI can be derived from reason is what is important. Thus, he does not address an objection that needing encounter the CI in writing makes the CI a contingent reality in the world. To understand why, we can look in several places. First, the Third Antinomy in the CPR. Here, the point is that the problems with the understanding cannot remove the space for morality, because morality is not accessed through the understanding. Kant develops this more positively across Groundwork, CPrR, Metaphysics of Morals, and Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone. In each of these texts, Kant presents somewhat different arguments for the Categorical Imperative as the rational morality that follows from human beings having both reason and a free will and being both rational choosers and empirically observable objects. To give a very rough sketch, what is common is always that we can only observe the phenomenal level of individuals and never gain access to their reason based on what happens. As material beings, they are subject to the very laws of physics that make morality seem impossible. But as rational beings, they are never mere subjects when it comes to moral action. 

In simple answer, no, there is no contemporary group involved in informal logic that thinks it should all be a question of formalization. Historically, there were those including Quine who believed all statements in normal languages could be transcribed into formal logic. This claim is by and large the central thesis of logical positivism. The idea has largely passed ... 

The answer the author intends is clearly B. Answers A and B are mutually incompossible. This could be seen using Venn diagrams or by thinking through the following: 

I think you're losing Aristotle's track when you suggest "two items" but maybe I am misreading you. (n.b., I'm not necessarily endorsing this as a true and complete model of change). 

Or to put it another way, the radical doubt attributed to "Descartes" really belongs to a boogie-man in the history of philosophy and Descartes engages in a slightly more pedestrian project that starts from the inner certainty of "clear and distinct ideas" 

Notice also the two exceptions where a valid form of reasoning can look like wishful thinking at the link. Along the same lines, if you are discussing a practical syllogism, it might matter that the conclusion would make you happy such as the following form: 

There's going to be some other theories to consider as well I'm guessing, but these are the ones I can sketch briefly. 

There's two ways of explaining why Mill is doing this. First, there's what I will call the "hedonist ratchet." And that's this pattern: 

Any action is good to the extent that its maxim is universalizable and respects humanity (rationality). Action q is undertaken under condition 1. Action q is good. Action q may also make you happy. 

Greek Distinction I think there have been several perhaps innumerable attempts to look at different modes of "knowing" in philosophy (here reading know as a larger category word for know, understand, comprehend, fathom). Obviously, the oldest one we have a substantial amount of writing from is Plato's account of knowledge in the idea of the Forms / ideas and the shadow copies we encounter. I'm not sure that discussion is very important for what you're looking for in this question. What might, however, be interesting is Aristotle's attempt to distinguish between different senses of knowing. He identifies three things we might translate as to know or to understand. He divies knowledge up into three basic categories at several points: 

or something sufficiently similar to this. If we want to be clearer, I would guess the author thinks a brute fact is something which has no further explanation. Given the expansive version, it seems the author presumes the theist must explain anything that is the case in terms of God. So, if we look at the "the fine structure constant". According to the author, the theist must explain the number in terms of either God's will in a voluntaristic (i.e. arbitrary sense) or possibly in terms of creation. I'm not convinced the author's suggestion is accurate or useful. In terms of accuracy, I don't know that all theists are committed to explaining everything in terms of God. Much here hinges on what is meant by explaining. If we mean simply some sort of causal story, then for many things theists would probably be committed having an explanation of this sort ( --> God created elephants). But it's not clear this must apply to everything. Returning to the fine structure constant, a theist could believe that this is fundamentally the case in a way where God doesn't have a free choice about its nature (this sort of thing is a major topic of debate among the medieval philosophers). As a more obvious example, some version of a law of non-contradiction seems pretty fundamental to everything. A second worry about this formulation is that explanations seem to come in different kinds. How did the bear get into the trash can and why did the bear get into the trash bin are pretty different. And the how doesn't seem at all to explain the why. To me it seems like bruteness should be focused on this sort of why explanation. But perhaps this is an area where people can disagree. A third concern is that the bruteness of facts seems to be a epistemological concept. Or at least, we must either say they are brute with respect to our ability to know (whether this can ever be fixed or not) or we are stuck in the interesting situation of not knowing if there are any brute facts (because how can we know something has no sufficient explanation?). If we cannot know, then it's a pretty useless category. If we can, then to some extent the bruteness seems equally accessible to theists on a why-level. (This might be the idea behind Platinga's basic beliefs). Returning back to your primary question, I think theists can accept brute facts about the world (or at least some). The free-will defense you suggest is an interesting angle, but it's efficacy hinges entirely on whether having a how-story fundamentally makes something non-brute. If so, then it won't work because the how-story will always go back to God (assuming a traditional account of creation) -- even if the how-story is not causal. 

which is a valid deductive argument -- in fact, it's an example of modus tollens. here T = "to travel in time" and C = "to change the past". But the soundness remains unclear or at least outside of the scope of what seems fair in a problem, because for it to be sound, the two premises must be true in addition to the form being valid. 

It is not clear that an event of rigid designation has occurred. The meaning of the phrase "over all possible worlds" is unclear vis-a-vis the act of rigid designation.
