A mental link is not much of a problem You ask, "would the mind be able to cope with controlling its own motions while also sending motor orders to body parts it doesn't even possess?" and the answer is "probably quite well, in fact." The human mind is actually incredibly adept at adopting tools into its "body plan" and a number of experiments have shown how relatively easily it is to trick the mind into thinking that things that aren't part of its body actually are. Just think of the phantom limb phenomenon. You may think that that is slightly different because it's a limb that the mind feels like it 'should' have, but further experiments have shown that you can convince the mind that completely foreign objects are part of it. Further, adapting extensions to our body plans is commonplace. When you use a tool such as a wrench or grabber, it subconsciously becomes part of our body plans, and we sort of feel like we have an extended reach. We're not getting nearly as much sensory information from the tool, just a bit of vibration and resistance, but we still adapt it into our body plan to feel as though it is part of us in a sense. We work by "feeling" things with our tools. Even when we're driving cars we have a sense of adapting the car to our body plan, using information we get from sight and touch from the vibrations moving the vehicle to sense how close we are to other objects, how straight we are on the road, etc. Experiments in inducing out of body experiences have shown that where we feel like our consciousness is is highly susceptible to suggestion. There's nothing paranormal or supernatural about it - it's just a trick of the subconscious. But people have been able to be convinced that they are actually inside dolls that are larger or smaller than them,, for example. You see where I'm going with this: If the mental link is providing sensory input from the mech's body, and the pilot's body is not receiving much variance in its sensory input (he's restrained in a comfortable seat), then the pilot will pretty readily feel like he is the mech. And it does help that the mech already has the same basic body plan of the pilot - it is easier to trick someone into thinking they're a doll than a car. (Likely, this trick of adapting tools into body plans evolved alongside tool use, because it makes us feel much more natural when using them. Any master craftsman who has told you that they treat their tools as an extension of their bodies is not just being poetic, this is a real thing. I wouldn't be surprised if other tool-using animals have a similar cognitive experience, but it's an abstract question to ask a bonobo. Either way this is an aside since your protagonist is a human, presumably.) 

There are a lot of good answers already about figuring out that it is magical, but I am not sure they are really fully addressing the question of finding it. If you want to be subtle, both for the readers and for NotBilly and his/her companions, then a very plain staff is a good starting point. It can even be visibly plain, but gradually shift over time, or look different in a certain light, but on the surface it should just look like a normal, utilitarian wooden pole that can be used for holding things up or hitting someone, just like any other length of reasonably sturdy wood. Finding the staff It should be found at a time when something like that is needed, maybe not precisely a wooden staff; it might just be the best option available at the time. For example, our hero and his intrepid band stumble across a small group of bandits and end up driving them off, but one of their party is injured. The injury is bad enough that they need to make a sledge or stretcher to carry him, this pole that was leaning against a tree is just one of the pieces of wood used for the structure of the sledge, and other thing scavenged from the bandit camp get more attention. Perhaps there is a richly-lined and warm fur cloak or a supple and well-balanced bow and a fine quiver of arrows. After getting to civilization and taking the injured person to get medical attention, the cloak, ropes used in the sledge and this staff simply get packed away with the rest of the gear. Later, someone (the bandits, wild animals, whatever makes sense) attacks the group at a time when they least expect it, NotBilly is near the gear and unarmed, the sledge-pole is nearby, he uses it to protect himself, and the next day, there he is, using it as a walking staff as they go. If NotBilly is the type of person who normally wields a sword, it would be unnatural for him to suddenly switch to a staff, even if he likes its balance and it "just feels right" in his hand; as soon as his current use for it is over, he would tend to swap back to the sword. It might be easier to have a non-combatant develop a flair for combat with a staff. On the other hand, having a sword-wielder gradually stop going for his sword and finding that he's reaching for the staff might be a clue that something is going on. At first, perhaps he tells himself he needs the reach on a taller opponent, or perhaps he doesn't have time to drop it and grab for his sword from the sheath, but later he leaves the sword untouched at his belt, and later he finds it is getting in the way and he leaves it in his pack. Abilities As noted in prior answers, durability, balance, and improved skill when using the weapon are very helpful here. It could also resist NotBilly being disarmed -- he is able to keep a grip even in circumstances where he would be expected to drop it or have it knocked out of his hands. On the other hand, he is surprisingly adept at disarming other opponents. He might develop an uncanny knack for subduing an opponent without causing major bodily harm, either destroying the weapons of his opponents or knocking them far out of reach, or managing to stun or knock someone unconscious without killing them. Blows that might otherwise be expected to break bones don't, but the opponent still stays down. Consider that a wooden staff is often the classic weapon of peace-loving characters, so perhaps this is a weapon that subdues aggressive instincts and increases protective ones in anyone who is touched by it. Perhaps it needs a flesh contact to work, so wearing gloves causes NotBilly to lose his new skills, and hitting someone where they are armored doesn't spread the pacification as well as knocking them on the ear or a bare ankle. The staff chooses to be wielded The staff has a personality that has grown over the decades or centuries since it was made and enchanted. It has an empathic connection with its bonded owner and will influence the user and be influenced by him. When out of the owner's hands, it is a normal staff, and it tries to get back to its owner. When it isn't bonded to anyone, it travels in search of a new person of the right frame of mind. It exerts a subtle influence to various people to pick it up -- either because it thinks they may be the next one, or because it thinks they will take it to a good place to find the next owner -- and they carry it for a little while until it exerts an influence for them to forget about it. Most don't ever notice. They needed a pole or staff at the time, then later they no longer needed it and forget where they left it, if they even think about it at all. And if they can't quite remember why they came to wherever it is that they ended up, it certainly wouldn't have anything to do with a bit of wood. It may have imprinted memories from its past, or even from past users, and it may share these after the bond has matured, or through dreams. 

It would not be possible for Earth-like life to exist there. Perhaps some kind of metallic-based organism, or something similar to a biological nanobot (an advanced type of virus, maybe?) with extreme self-repair capabilities, extreme resistance to heat and radiation, might be able to survive, especially in areas like the sides of ancient craters, where the sun never fully reaches but which aren't in complete darkness either, and which are less likely to be affected as much by new bombardment. 

Well, just as a simplistic example, earlier today when I was writing about this very topic, when I was saying that the technology in the time period of my world would have been indistinguishable from magic to the same extent that telegraphs, or telephones, or smart phones would have seemed like magic—each more powerful magic than the previous one—to a primitive civilization, I said, “such as pre-technological people,” meaning, not yet having agriculture, the wheel, or even complex tool use yet. I wouldn't have used like Romans or even just post-Neolithic people in general as my example. I would say, if you are holding some kind of mechanism, at least some people will not be entirely convinced that it's magic. If it's small enough to be implanted inside your body or brain and it can be powered by your own muscle movements or the planet's electrical field or something like that, I think most 19th-century tech level or earlier people, at the very least, will be hard to convince it isn't magic. Hell, there're people alive today who would be. And who's to say it's not magic? If you have a technology that can bend spacetime or hack into the laws of physics and rewrite them to your specs, is that in the category of technology or magic? I would classify it as being both, personally. 

The 'tell' is obvious if it is checked for, but no one thought to check him because he didn't have defects. Most of the time, a child born with a disability is checked by the delivering physician (or healer or alchemist, whatever your world has) or midwife, or a physician later in life when the disability becomes apparent. But as your hero was healthy throughout his life, and as the more 'obvious' effects of his mutation were still subtle, he never had the test. Storywise, it would make sense if it could be accidentally discovered. I'm thinking something like a blood test: maybe a mutant's blood turns a different color when mixed with sulfur and heated. Maybe he trips in a bat-infested cave and wounds himself, then cauterizes the wound, and the sulfur from the guano reacts with the blood from the wound as he heats it, thus revealing his mutation. Something like that. 

If you wish to use magic, you must apply for a permit. The permit is very cheap, or even free, as administrative costs in issuing and tracking them come out of the magic tax. If you are caught doing magic without a permit, you face fines, the severity of which depend on the "amount" of magic you're doing. (And possibly type, depending on what you want to enforce. Though using destructive magic harmfully would be a separate penalty.) Every year (or quarter or whatever, depending on how long energies take to dissipate), permit-holders must renew, at which point their auras are read and the tax is levied. There will be rogues and there will be people trying to cheat the system, but that's what ATF is for. (Arcana, Tetragrammaton, and Fate, of course.) 

There is another example in nature that hasn't been mentioned yet, "Agouti banding". My tabby cat's fur has bands of color like this, with grey then beige then a dark band and some have light tips. 

Urdu and Hindi are another example of this. The grammar and a large part of the vocabulary is essentially identical between the languages, but the writing in Urdu is based on Arabic and some vocabulary -- mostly formal or poetic language -- is from Arabic and Persian roots. In contrast, the writing in Hindi comes from Sanskrit, as do the corresponding poetic and formal language terms. Someone who speaks Urdu or Hindi can readily converse with speakers of the other language (although they might recognize from certain word choices and/or accent that it is a speaker of the other language), but if they wanted, they could also probably make themselves unintelligible by switching to a very formal register of speech. This multilingual sign demonstrates this. The top line is in Hindi (written in devanagri script) and the bottom right is in Urdu nastaliq script. 

I think there are actually two things here. One is "why aren't they rulers in their own right?", and the other is "why don't those they swear allegiance to use them to dominate their competition?" I'll answer each in turn. Why aren't they rulers? Not all heroes are good rulers, and many don't even want to rule. Prancealot is devoted to his religion moreso than he desires to be a ruler. The Kung Few have always been treated well by the Emperor and have no desire to upset that status quo. The 299.5 are soldiers, not administrators - and besides, 299.5 people trying to co-lead a nation would run into disputes over the best way to do things - and Hercufleas mostly just wants to retire to his farm. Why doesn't their sovereign use them to conquer? In addition to the points others have made about the balances of power (that is, other kingdoms have their own heroes and other heroes could band together, etc), there are reasons that the heroes may not be able to be swayed by even their lord to use their skills for their own gain. Prancelot's religious convictions make him want to defend the innocent, not conquer. The Emperor is wise enough to know that the Kung Few have a good point that their already impressive empire doesn't need to conquer the smaller states around it. The 299.5 recognize that their situation was unique and they don't want to push their luck. Hercufleas still just wants to be left alone to his farm. Now, a clever king could persuade even these heroes. "Prancelot, bring your religion to the heathens", "But the Kung Few, this nation over here has the temple holding the ancient scrolls of the Kung Many", "299.5, you are soldiers, what else are you going to do?, "Hercufleas, if you don't I'll burn down your farm." These things tend to end poorly for almost everyone involved, of course, because myths are usually Aesops. 

In terms of non-great ape animals (which I assume is not what you want, since they will basically just evolve into something that is, well, more or less like humans, probably… unless you're going for a Planet of the Apes-type vibe) I believe that African grey parrots are probably the closest in terms of having the “full package” towards intelligence, including a decent ability to manipulate their surroundings with their talons, with the added benefit that they can also fly! They're not quite there in terms of being able to use tools, but in terms of everything else, they're close to being “sapience-ready,” I think. The other contender, often overlooked in my opinion, is the cuttlefish. They have a surprising number of highly-advanced mental capacities, especially considering that invertebrates are often thought of as being universally far less sophisticated or “less evolved” than vertebrates, and they have their tentacles that they can use to pick things up and move them around… plus, if you go with the cuttlefish, you can have them evolve into a Cthulhu-like or Illithid-type race, which is a cool trope, I think! There are lots of different theories about what aspects of a creature push it more towards overall “intelligence,” as we would probably define it in a worldbuilding context. Social behaviors and ability to manipulate one's surroundings are two of the most important ones, I believe. 

One potential method: the lifecycle of the host organism is complex and evolved to include four different organisms. A fungus, the subterranean beast, the wildlings, and a worm. The fungus infects the worm, which then is either eaten by the beast or the worm itself is also a parasitic organism that infects the beast. The beast spreads out long appendages that resemble trees that it uses to collect nutrients, water, and oxygen from the surface. This is something that the beast just does, whether it is infected or not, but the fungus has hijacked this process to spread its spores throughout this network. Once spread to the 'trees', the spores infect the wildlings. Like Cordyceps, it causes a change in behavior in certain organisms that it infects. In this case, it makes them aggressive and causes growths of black 'skin' and 'claws'. The skin is actually a covering of the fungal spores - the same spores present in the 'trees', so the aggressive behavior helps to spread it further. The 'claws' are a by-product of a change in the production of keratin. The hive mind is accomplished through pheromone communication. We know that plants actually have rudimentary forms of communication - it doesn't sound like too much of a stretch that a fungus could. The "queen" is really the colony of matured spores living in the subterranean beast. The juvenile spores also communicate with one another. Granted this can't go long distances, but 'messages' can get passed along a chain. The ultimate goal is for the infected wildlings to die, whereupon they become food for the larval form of the worm that then infects the beast. 

(You can see a direct comparison of the characters in wikipedia as well.) Edit: I thought of more examples. You mentioned Cyrillic. This was a script brought into Slavic lands by Christian missionaries, who adapted it from Greek characters. It is hypothesized that a runic script was used by the Slavs before this. People who were educated in the new script would very likely not be able to read the runes and vice versa. How could I forget Japanese? They have 3 sets of characters used in their modern language, plus of course transliteration to Roman characters. They use kanji (adapted from Chinese hanzi), hiragana (for spelling words out in syllables) and katakana (generally used for spelling or foreign words and a few other uses). Foreign learners often start off learning Japanese with transliterated romaji (the Japanese equivalent of pinyin, essentially) and may never progress past hiragana to read kanji. Children start with katakana and hiragana as well. You can also consider that a person who has vision impairment or a disorder such as dislexia might still be highly educated and articulate while having serious difficulties with the written form of language. There are also languages with no native written form, such as Navajo. Finally, you do not have to look back far in history to find a culture where a large group of people was socially segregated and not permitted to learn to read. In the US, before slavery was abolished, slaves were not permitted to learn to read. Some individuals were still able to become strong orators.
