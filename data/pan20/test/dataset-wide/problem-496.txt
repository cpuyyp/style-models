ROI for dynamo lights is poor in the era of LEDs for the bulk of the population (there are always exceptions of course). I can buy a nice set of LED front/rear lights for around $50. Add-on regular batteries for another $5 or so. OK, I'm in for under $60. I researched dynamos and I was looking at $250+ for just the power unit itself. Add-in another $50 of lights and I'm at $300. I can buy 50 sets of batteries (we'll keep it simple and assume my savings will match inflation) for the upcharge of a dynamo. These batteries last years of usage with LEDs. I'd never even break even with a dynamo in my lifetime, nevermind actually saving money. 

Not as practical as some of the other solutions, but if you know a car guy, they've probably got brake pad spreaders laying around. You should be able to get an edge or corner far enough in to use them. 

I really enjoy cycling, but haven't been doing much lately. My wife also enjoys cycling, but had a bad crash a couple years ago on her fast road bike and now will only ride her old (really slow) touring bike. We're not sure why she crashed, she doesn't remember much of it, and I was ahead of her at the time. She's concerned that it might be a balance problem, and has never been very comfortable with her road bike. I was thinking that a tandem might be the way to go. Thought being that it would be more stable, and she wouldn't have to be responsible for steering. It would also keep us together while riding (her maximum speed right now is lower than my minimum speed, I end up doing lots of 360s in the middle of the road to let her catch up). Difficulty being transporting it around for group rides. We have 3 small cars (MR2, Celica, and Eclipse). One is a two seater that I have a regular bike rack that fits, the other two are hatchbacks (neither has much space in the back, one of them can fit her road bike, but only if she takes the front wheel off). Are there any tandems that "fold up" to fit on a standard bike rack? I just don't see roof racks as being an option as the cars are so small. Any other ideas that I've missed? I don't think she'd go for the balance wheels on her bike (and it still wouldn't cover all the speed difference issue). 

On one of my bikes with an analog speedometer, back when I was in really good shape, I decided to find out. Got a good run onto the biggest downhill around and hammered it all the way down. Got the speedo up to an indicated 60mph before running out of hill (65 is where it maxed out, not sure how accurate it was). It was very smooth feeling, all the low speed vibration and bumps pretty much went away, however, I realized that if anything bad were to happen that I was going to die. Never again. 

In Ohio, the way I read it, it appears that lighting falls under the generic vehicle lighting guidelines, so bicycles are required to act like cars in this one aspect (other rules explicitly state motorized vehicle or even "motorcycle"). So, lights are required when: 

Legally permitted to direct traffic (with force of law), no, not anywhere I'm aware of. That's a state/police reserved power in all cases I can think of. Could someone do that in an advisory capacity, sure. Are they opening themselves up to liability. Yep. Very much so. Especially since there's no requirement that anyone follow their directions (thus they may appear to be offering "safe crossing" when they have no legal basis to be able to guarantee it). Don't do it, and use great caution when around people that are doing it. 

I just slide a couple fingers under the chuck (and against the wheel) and basically pry against the wheel. Takes very little effort compared to trying to pull, and it pops the chuck off without any risk of banging your hands into anything. 

The reason for bedding them in is to get the proper performance and lifetime out of them that they were designed for. The process should be specified by the manufacturer. It will vary based on the pad's materials/design. 

For some types the answer appears to be "just marketing". I've got a 58cm road bike with 700x23 tires, and 18" wide handlebars. My wife's old bike (which she no longer uses and is now the one that I can beat around in town with when I don't feel like wearing cycling shoes since it has platforms on 1 side of the pedals) is a 53cm frame, 700x23 tires, and 16" wide handlebars. Crank lever length is 7" for both of them. Dimensions on her "women's" bike match smaller "men's" bikes... And yes, it's a little small for me for a road bike, but actually very closely matches the dimensions on my MTB which I was using to beat around town on... :-) 

I've had this problem before (recently), and it was solved with a thorough cleaning and then re-oiling of the derailleur. 

How much weight do you put on your hands while riding? If you've got a bike that has you leaning forward and putting weight on the hands, you may want to consider a bike with a more upright seating position. That will cut down on the weight on the hands issue. I think I know what you're talking about. I spend all day behind a computer too, and if I spend much time on my race bike, I get tingly hands. If I put most of my miles on my MTB, then I don't get the tingly hand episodes. 

A light bike is so much more fun to ride than a heavy one that you'll be more likely to ride the light one. Also, I find that on my lighter bike, since it's easier to go faster, I'm always pushing to go as fast as I can (because fast is fun). On the heavy bike, it's so much work that I end up going slow and ultimately not working as hard. An hour on the heavy bike and I'll not even be tired. An hour on the light bike and I'm exhausted and the muscles are burning and will be sore for a day or 2! :-) 

Don't know what to say. I didn't have any trouble with mine in 10 speed configuration. I didn't do any special cable routing, just backed the limit screws all the way out (I seem to recall there's an outer AND inner limit screw?) and tweaked until it worked... Only thing of note that I remember at all was moving one of the spacers on my cassette so that it would freewheel (cassette I'm using says it's not compatible with the wheels I use and indeed turns the bike into a fixie, but I found that moving a spacer makes it compatible and lets it freewheel).
