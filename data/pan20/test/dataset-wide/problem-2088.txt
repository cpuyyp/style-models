There are two things to consider and as requested, I'll try to make a general answer. First, the question of how will you get your first contract. Freelancers usually use references and previous work to get contracts. You claim you have no references in this field and no "real" previous work. So you can count only on your persuading skills. You should begin with small projects first so that you can easier convince a potential customer to go with you, and it will allow you to build a portfolio which can get you more contracts later. Second, the question of how you will manage to satisfy your first customer. Suppose you managed to get a contract, congrats: 1/10 of the work is done. Because now you have to deliver so that this first experience translates into a reliable reference. All that said, regarding your question or whether "you're ready or not" - I've seen many freelancers claiming to be "experts" in such field, and it appeared they were really not that proficient. It doesn't mean that you have to do the same and it's not intended to make people lower their mediocrity acceptance threshold. Just that if you have sufficient soft skills and you kind-of know your way in the technical stuff you want to use, then it seems quite doable to get your first contracts. Technically speaking, don't listen to people bashing at freelancers who are in the habit of "learning stuff at the expense of their customers". People (freelancers, employee) are always learning things at the expense of their customers/employers. Except the ones that decide to settle. 

If other employees from other departments do it, and if it is allowed/encouraged by the company, then go for it. You might get some "funny" comments from your colleages the next day, but at least you had fun and did what you wanted. 

Depends on your industry. But, since your boss said they dress casual, I'd say that wearing a suit will do no harm nor good. I, as a software developer, have never cared about over/under dressing. I've worked in start-ups, small companies(50~150 people) and big companies (2000+) and in none of them someone said anything about the way I dress. In all of them it was casual. I always go to work with jeans trousers and a T-shirt. But in all interviews I keep the jeans trousers and change the tee for a polo. I noticed that anytime someone overdresses, people make light jokes about that. But, if you work for a bank, for example, you might have to wear a suit and tie. 

Follow up to: How do I handle a solo developer position as a junior developer in a start-up? (If you are wondering what decision I have took regarding the above questions, I remained in the company) I am in a difficult situation where I need to take decision in the following six to twelve months about my career advancement. January 2018 I am going to complete my three years apprenticeship as a Backend Web Development in a startup. I am currently the only real developer working for the company (99.9% they are going to renew my position with a full-time indeterminate contract). I currently maintain a total of approximately 30 repositories, each representing either an entire project, or small libraries shared across the repositories. The company is going really well as of recently, however I feel like I could be improving a lot more if I had a senior as a tutor. I feel like a rally driver without a co-pilot. I am confident a senior would help me get better with design patterns, making sure I design softwares properly, in order to prevent issues down the road, long-term. I have a few options, which are the following: 

To me, it simply looks like you've got bored to death with your job. You already proved you can do what's expected from you now and now it's done you don't have the energy to repeat yourself. The good news is it's a sign of intellectual strength - you're just not a code monkey and you can deliver only when the job represents a challenge to you. So go ahead and talk with your boss, but not about your underperformance. Rather about the fact that you performed really well with your current level of assignments, and that your boss could use this ability to a higher level. Your sense of guiltiness may not come from your underperformance but from your inability to take a bold move and say : 

Remember that as a recruiter/boss/manager, it's his job to look friendly/honest/fine in order to keep people coming to work at his place. In no case it means that he really is. Makes me think of people who buy something because "the salesman was nice and appeared honest". Yeah, it's just his full-time job to appear nice and honest. 

I see three options: 1 - Ask the company to buy one, so everybody can use it 2 - Raise funds with your colleages to buy one (we did this with the coffee machine here) 3 - Bring your own, but be prepared to see people use or eventually break it. Anyway, ask your boss or HR first to see if it is allowed to bring your own stuff to the office. 

If your boss is a person worth not cutting ties with, a simple "Thanks for all the help and opportunities, but I'm off to new adventures" is enough. 

I've been searching for a new job as a software developer in the last few weeks and have noticed that in every single one of the interviews there's a pattern. First, there's a "get to know you" interview with a HR representative, where I'm asked things like who do I live with, what do I expect of the position I'm being interviewed for, which were my past professional experiences and things like that. After this interview with HR, there will most likely be a techinical interview. The problem is that I'm searching for a job in a specific part of town. To get there, I have to leave earlier (and lose almost the whole afternoon) and come in later (and lost most of the morning), since my current company is kinda far from where I'm interviewing and I need to use public transportation. So, would it be unprofessional, impolite or come off as if I didn't want the job that much if I ask if there really is a need for an in-person interview or if we could use the phone or skype? Edit: I work as a web developer in Brazil. 

If I stay in my company, and all goes well, career advancement in this company is almost ensured, however I am not even sure if I'd accept to climb up the ladder knowning I wouldn't be actually worth for it. What are your suggestions? Thank you. 

I have been working as Junior Web Developer (self-taught) in a start-up company for six months until now. I am currently 19 years old and this is my first employment. I have been programming since five years in my own free time as I develop for passion. However I am having an hard time at keeping up with my current position due to lack of manpower and experience. My only colleague, tutor and boss at the same time is not exactly a developer. He's more of a Web Designer, he only takes care of UX and stylesheets of the website. He barely knowns anything of our server-side language we use and knows as little in terms of Javascript. Currently we are working on our internal website and things have been going pretty well except of the unusual ways of handling the life cycle of the product. The issue is that management underestimates the time that is needed to complete a certain task in a decent manner. For example, I have been given the task to complete two websites in twenty-one days and it is really a very hard task given the fact we have just released on production our new internal website and we are constantly running on bugs related to it. The thing I "hate" the most is that I need to take care both of back-end and front-end development (that is, Javascript) which I don't really have time for. Our current Javascript code is really.. bad and as much as I'd like to study more about Javascript, it would really be detrimental to my work-life balance (as I can't study on work hours). I feel like a second developer that takes care only of front-end development, or even better a full stack web developer would benefit A LOT our team. Upper management however due to economical issues can't afford a new developer for now. This position is a huge responsibility towards the company since it's a break it or make it situation for us (due to an upcoming project) and I don't want to fuck it up, however I am struggling a lot. Update (28/04/16) To whoever whishes to know the updates about the situation explained in the question: things gradually started to get better. The company is growing larger in the country and we've hired a second developer that deals with front-end development (currently of an application used internally, and the front-end codebase of what's going go to be the new company website). I am still the most busy in the team since the business model is changing quickly and the current back-end needs to stay up to date. Just wanted to let you all know, especially to those who had bad hopes at the beginning. 

Why would they know you've been promoted? In the off chance that they call your current employer and he tells them, just say the obvious: you thought it would be a good thing, but it didn't meet all your expectations. 

Your boss already knows that most likely you won't stay for five years. Also, consider that if YOU said that you had to stay in this position for five years and your boss promoted you anyway, he wouldn't think twice if he had to fire you halfway through this period. So, take the position. If asked about, say the truth. If he hires you anyway, it's up to him to prepare for your departure. If he doesn't hire you, at least you tried. 

Just go on and tell him. You're helping him save money. Were it the other way around, then you would need an excellent document. Edit: If you need help explaining, just say something along the lines of: "Hei b0ss, I know that you're worried about my productivity and wanted to buy that new machine. But I found this 10 bucks cable that will be more useful and way cheaper than a new PC. What do you think about this?".
