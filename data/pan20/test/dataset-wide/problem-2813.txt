The article should be read as polemic (but referencing the science established under the aegis of the IPCC), and as such both well-written and unusual in the tactics they've chosen. 

It's worth pointing out here, that this can be made a little more concrete by using some of the concepts of modern mathematics - but without introducing all it's technical apparatus. Recall first, that spacetime is conceptualised as a manifold. Then recall second, that manifolds can be given in two ways; either by themselves or in another; an example, may make this clearer: I can draw the manifold that is a circle on the manifold that is a sheet of paper - this illustrates manifolds given as in another - the second option above; but by an act of the imagination, I can subtract the paper, leaving simply the circle - which doesn't hang there in the air - like the smile of the Cheshire Cat when the cat disappears; it's the circle - simply itself, by itself - ungrounded and groundless - it is it's own ground; this is the first option above. So when this universe, is the only universe - and there is no other, to ask where it is appears to not admit of any answer. But were we to suppose there were more, we could only say that a particular universe is within the multiverse - whilst noting that here, within is not the spatial within; in fact, generally any two universes could not possibly be spatially located in relation to each other - for then we would call them as one. 

I can see how Nietzsche fits into this picture, but how does Spinoza? In his works, for example his Ethics his cosmology is firmly based on the idea of God: 

Propositional systems have axioms and inference rules. They bifurcate into two types, Hilbert-style where the number of inference rules are minimised; and Natural Deduction where the number of axioms are minimsed. In fact it is possible to have Natural Deduction systems that have no axioms, I'm not sure if this is in fact the usual ones looked at. In general Hilbert-Style systems usually have just one inference rule: modus ponens. Obviously it is possible to have a Hilbert-style formal system with no inference rules, the question is whether they are useful in anyway? (Perhaps if we consider the category of all Hilbert-style formal systems they need to be included to get good formal properties for the category?) 

In this paper, by William Jensen (Dept Chem, University of Cincinnati) on Newton & Lucretius, he details the introduction of Epicurean atomism into renaissance intellectual life: 

Biology may be all very logical & simple to understand now. But if you look at its historical development you will notice that it wasn't always this way. What you see now is the end-product of a still on-going complex debate. And its still ongoing, for example the contemporary debate about the origin of consciousness and the relation to the neuroscience is controversial. History is a scholarly subject, it has its own ethic & means of scholarly investigation and this includes the philosophical contours of the subject, which includes questions how does one form an idea of objective history as opposed to a history written by the politically strong (this is one of the reasons for Black History studies in America, post-colonial studies in the West). How does one distinguish history from mere opinion - this question goes back to Herodotus (at least in the West). What counts as justifiable evidence? 

Miracles are used generally in theological/religous contexts; outside of them they're seen as either rationally explicable as signifiers of theological truths that are uncovered by hermeneutics of various kinds. I want to see whether there are other valid ways at looking at miracles that might signify the presence of God. For example - one question is why is there something rather than nothing. Physics starts from the supposition that some substance is there, and then establishes the laws that it obeys (generally conservation laws). The explanation that the universe appeared out of nothing through some fluke quantum fluctuation doesn't explain anything, or more precisely it just pushes what is to be explained further back - that is the laws that guarantee a such a possible fluctuation. It's easily seen that a similar argument results in an infinite regression. Nor does Smolins offering of a eco-system of universes seedng each other offer a way out of this conundrum. Hence the fundamental question remains - why something rather than nothing - does this count as a miracle? For example, in Quranic hermenaeutics, the world is called th Greater Quran because it also signifies the presence of Allah (as Creater); Is there anyway around this argument of infinite regression? I can't see that it is possible. In fact it has some contact with the antinomies of Kant who demonstrated there are question beyond the remit of reason. Which means that they must remain either unresolved or must be filled by faith of some kind. A second possibility is the limits of causality that Hume identified, as well as al-Ghazali. Hume offered no resolution. Al-Ghazali offered Occasionalism - that is the world is sustained from moment to moment by the Allah. (In Koranic Hermeneutics its referred to the verse Al-Fatiha where Allah is called the sustainer of the Worlds). Kant, of course offered a reasoned resolution by correlationism (which signifies the correlation between the human mind & the real). One might say, rather than God sustaining the illusion of the world as phenomena, it is the human mind - one has substituted Man for God - in at least as this position; but of course this still rather leaves noumena as undescribable and unexplained. 

Its well known that Plato was from the aritocratic elite of Athenian society. In his writings Socrates figure as his pre-eminent philosophical spokesperson. There is a adage, which might be a truism that Philosophy can only be engaged by a social strata that has leisure. Yet Socrates is historically seen as a stone-mason, an artisan and a man who work works with his hands; it is arguable that the nature of his social origin and his position in the philosophical firmament of Plato that marked him as an antogonist with Nietzsche. It seems from all this that Socrates occupies an ambiguous social position. What would have been his social position in the context of the Athenian polity (and not in terms of the contemporary European situation)? 

The slave is a some-one; who also has his ethical being; one need not assume from the outset that he must be bad; this does not mean that one should assume that he is wholly good; most men are imperfect; one should use observation & judgement. 

We can formally write a contradiction as, p and (not p); these statements in classical logic will always evaluate to false. Now, a true contradiction means that actually this evaluates to true. Now, it's just occurred to me that there is a converse to this: p or (not p) always evaluates to true. If we insist it evaluates to false, we could say it is a false co-contradiction! Is there actually a formal name for this? They are mirror images though - if the usual laws are available since: 

This is a response to question 3: The first sentence is intelligence as theoretical rationality, and here keyed to science as a symbol or image of it as such. The second sentence is intelligence as practical rationality, and there keyed to the practical common-sense of knowing how to use; this is in a sense, phenomenology. Wisdom is a problematic term to define; but given the nomenclature of 'wisdom literature' applied to a certain genre of literature situated in the Levant, and elsewhere; an example being Proverbs in the Bible; it is closer to the second than the first. 

Admiration seems to be a sensible riposte: I can never hope to rival Mohammed Alis boxing genius, but I can admire the fight in him. I can never hope to rival Gandhis moral courage, but I can admire his fortitude. I can never fly like a humming-bird, or sting like a bee - but I can admire them. Etc, etc, etc. (& Etc, etc, etc) 

Atoms, as is well known, was originated by Democritus to fend of Parmenides challenge of an unchangeable, eternal one. The other large category of thought in modern physics is that of the wave. Where was this orinated from. Should we hazard Thales, who said all was water? So waves ripple on the liquid surface of being? One common understanding of Thales thought, is that water is an originary principle, which possibly ties it in with Egyptian and Hebrew creation myths - but another angle of thought shows that water takes up the shape of any vessel that water is poured, what if that vessel was the shape of a pebble, or a shape of a man? Or indeed the shape of a universe. Or should we hazard the whole school which elaborates this thought - the Miletus School - Anaximander, who subracted the specificity of water to come up with a preconception of substance - being without quality, and Anaximenes who instead posited air, and a process of rarefaction & condensation. 

If they've failed, then they've failed very badly considering just how many people in the world are convinced that there Brahman and his avatars, God and Allah. The problem here is your word 'proof'; what is understood as proof in mathematics has been established by long consensus; the originary point usually taken as Euclid (but probably established earlier - given how these things work); where a pardigm of precision in both definition, proof and theorem are established; and the theorems look incontrovertible given that the axioms look 'clear and distinct'. The Sophists reacted against the dialectical argument of Socrates to provide a similar 'universality' to ethics; Socrates chased definitions of lache (courage) to make them more precise; but they argued, that in this area where possibility (is a definition of lache* possible) and vagueness (what exactly is lache) are important one argues for on the basis of probability - its the key criterion one uses in a court; thus one wants to build persuasive arguments; not arguments of proof on the mathematical model. Hence the usual arguments of faith can be considered arguments of persuasion; and they have historically been very effective. 

As one answer has already pointed out the locus classicus of this is Parmenides. He stated that what actually is, is unchangeable; this is in contrast to the world that we see, which as Aristotle noted is full of change (and he said science was the art of discerning the principles of change). Its probably likely that this notion was not original with Parmenides, but he provided an extended argument supporting this thesis. (One might posit that mythically this arose with contemplating the sun as the source of all life on earth and thus all change on earth, yet in itself it is unchanged - but this is speculation). Hence the idea arose that the world that we see is an illusion; that it is mere appearance, or seeming; that it shines (schein) forth (from a hidden lamp - being); or overflows - thus theories of real being that are emanatory theories (which includes modern cosmology - in a sense). Similar ideas have arisen in Vedanta where the notion of the world being an illusion is called maya; and Buddhism where the real is altogether denied - it lacks svabhava (own-ground or real being). However the word 'illusion' is a little strong, given the world that we see is manifestly real; I mean it is not the fantasy world of a fiction; thus in Buddhism they distinguish between conventional reality & ultimate reality - and this might be a better way to look at it. 

The terms highlighted is what Einstein managed to introduce to gravity. Generally, Maxwells equation are presented as a set of four vector equations; but why four dimensions? Can we generalise for higher - and it turns out we can (using the language of forms), and better the equations simplify to an almost symmetrical pair of equations - so the number of equations have been cut in half (originally Maxwell had twenty equations - so there's been a long process of chipping them down). But more, in this form it's also true for any curved space - this is also very useful because physically, spacetime is curved; and we need the equations to be valid in just such a context and not the usual boring Euclidean space that we're all used to simply by living, being and perceiving. The second development is to notice that light has a hidden symmetry - a circle; this can be made a little more explicit if you view light as a travelling wave with transverse components of a magnetic and electric field. This is most easily seen visually; but in words if you take the vector sum of the field strengths you get exactly what looks like a clock-hand spinning around a circle; and this picture and metaphor is useful as light beats out time. This is the hidden symmetry of light; Geometrically thought of as a circle; it's also referred to as 'gauge freedom', or 'internal symmetry space'. The next step was taken by Yang and Mills; when they replaced the circle by higher spheres. It's in this form that EM and the weak force was unified - electroweak and then the strong force formulated. Then the obvious thing to think, is that given the origins of this theoretical development in Maxwells EM, to see corresponding features in its concrete generalisations. Interestingly, gravity itself can be cast into this language (but whereas light can be quantised in this language, gravity still proves resistant). This is one of the key moves in the last century - geometrisation; not only in physics, but also number theory (ie Grothendiecks theory of schemes) ; they're essentially the same language - fibre- bundles or just bundles: whereas GR just has spacetime, EM for example, attaches (or bundles) a fibre (which looks like a circle or sphere) at every point. Actually, all this is also interesting from a metaphysics of light perspective; given geometry is something we do by eye - as opposed to algebra which we do by touch ie counting on ones fingers. But this isn't really what the metaphysics is about; the locus classicus is Socrates in the Republic, where he asks why is a third thing is required to see - the Sun.
