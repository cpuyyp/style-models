The question seems to be less about time, and the consequences or requirements for time travel, and more on convincing a person that you did, in fact, travel in time. One way to do this is to explain how time travel works to the person. If the engineer farther is able to comprehend the time travel, then he may be more open to the plausibility. That may be difficult, as time travel isn't actually possible, so you may need other methods. Perhaps tell them things they tell you in the future. An issue with that would be them thinking you're a spy (like you mentiones in the OP). You could try telling them advice they give you later on. If they recognize the advice as something they would conceivably say, they may be more inclined to believe you. Another possibility would be asking them what would convince them. The issue would be that it isn't guaranteed to satisfy or convince them, and what they ask may not be possible. The main issue would be that very little is a sure-fire way to convince anyone. It does somewhat depend on how willing they would be to believe. If you had preparation, you could take items they'd recognize as unique, but had succumb to weathering over time. You could also bring a recording of your parents from your time telling your parents in the past that it really is time travel. If that's not possible, pictures of your parents may work. It isn't usually one major proof (unless you had them travel in time too), but many mini proofs put together to build a foundation of belief. So it would likely be best to establish a charismatic, friendly interaction with them, and ease into the subject. 

I'll leave the final choice up to you, but this is what I envision for each choice: Path 1 As information changes, it becomes different; even if a human were cloned, memories and all, the 'new human' and the 'old human' would rapidly begin to differ. Belongings are left to the first copy to claim them; the android is the first system online, and thus would get all the belongings. Future copies are left with nothing and treated as new beings. Path 2 The human brain isn't a computer; while it's possible to destructively copy (aka move) the contents to a digital version, at no point in time does the personality become fully information. These special digital brains are still physical objects, and the only way to copy a brain is by destroying the original, be it digital or organic. An android would have the brain stuck inside it; a "software only" version would simply hook the digital brain up to a computer. While it's possible to make a non-destructive copy, the result is only superficially similar. Anyone comparing the brainwave signature of the bad copy to the original human or to the digital copy would instantly see they were different. Path 3 Once uploaded, a human mind will realize just how easy it is to make copies of itself. Splits and merges become commonplace; androids become rent-a-bodies, to deal with the physical world. To sync, two minds merge, then make a copy to "split". Each mind has its own signature, a unique key. When two copies of a single mind merge, the signature remains the same, but if two different minds merge, they create a new signature, a child mind, an equal merge between the two. Belongings are shared equally between the minds of a given signature. Essentially, any cluster of minds with the same signature are considered a single collective being. 

Different Male/Female Birthrates Biologically speaking, humans have roughly one child per gestation (twins, triples, etc. being relatively rare don't bump the average up by much) and the odds of male:female birth are basically 50:50. If the ratio were skewed such that female babies were much more common than males, then society as a whole would view females as much more expendable for war than we ever have in the past. (i.e. if only 1-in-100 children born were male, then "men and boys first" would make much more sense than "women and children first" in disaster/survival situations.) The societal roles, expectations, values, etc. could all change very little or quite significantly depending on the ratios involved and their causes/prevalence. Most of those changes can be plausibly tweaked for your fictional setting, however. You can assume a matriarchal society could be a perfect war-free utopia, or you could assume that the womenfolk would be the ones to take up arms. 

Global Warming Doesn't Work Like That The problem with global warming isn't that carbon dioxide or methane in the atmosphere "warms up easily" but rather that it absorbs too much of the infrared energy that Earth emits back to space. Therefore, we have as much solar energy coming in as always, but now not enough of Earth's infrared emissions are escaping to space before being reabsorbed. That excess of reabsorbed infrared is why we're accumulating heat. To counteract the effect of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide you'd either have to either make the atmosphere reflect away more incoming solar energy, or have it emit more of the Earth's excess infrared. Neither of these involve the kind of cold-feeling heat-absorbing material you imagine. 

Thoughts are hard to hide Dan Smolinske's answer has one fatal flaw: though Alice won't think about stealing the object, she sill surely think about returning the object. If the priests are as watchful as they claim, she would immediately be detained, and once it was discovered that she was carrying a fake, the game would be up, and she would be reduced to a viscous fluid. I make two assumptions: one, that any thought of moving, replacing, or otherwise touching the artifact(s) would trigger a response, and two, that the chamber echoes words in any language, but only words, rather than the full imagery of thought. Alice needs to encode her thoughts, and in a way that the priests cannot decode. If she thinks in another language, there is always the chance that she might slip up, or worse that one of the priests speak that language and catch her red-handed. Red-minded? Anyway. Double-speak Rather than convincing herself (through training, hypnosis, etc.) that she is not stealing the artifact, Alice should convince herself that words mean something different. Alice needs to replace words that she may think with other words; replacing 'steal' with 'worship' means that when she thinks, "I'm going to steal that artifact," it comes out, "I'm going to worship that artifact!" Replacing 'thief' with 'sinner' means Alice thinks, "I'm a thief," but the priests hear, "I'm a sinner." Other suspicious words should also be traded out: "I hope they don't catch me" should become "I hope they don't hate me," for instance. Verbal Overlap Alternately, it may be as simple as quoting words from memory. When I speak out loud, my "inner voice" is drowned out; further, since the long passage is from memory, Alice's thoughts will be turned to memory, rather than thieving. She should memorize two passages, each about 15 minutes long, and quote them on her way to and from the Inner Sanctum. Inside, she can take as long as she wants to secure the object, and resume quoting when she exits. She should choose monologues, rather than poetry or songs; poetry can be too simple to remember, due to rhyming. A prepared speech or sermon would be an excellent choice, especially if it has to do with piety; anything to distract the priests from its true purpose. Non-verbal language An acquaintance of mine, fluent in ASL, underwent a surgery that caused total deafness for about a month. She said that at the end of the month, she often thought in sign language, rather than in English; after she could hear again, her inner voice transitioned back to spoken language within a few days. Likewise, Alice first needs to learn a language-complete sign language (such as ASL). She also needs to find several contacts in the deaf community; they can help her learn faster. After a month of very hard study, she should have a decent grasp of the language. She then needs to inflict (reversible) deafness on herself, and communicate only with her new deaf friends, to buffer herself against spoken language. If a magical/mystical/technological means of inflicting deafness is not available, cotton or wool stuffed in the ear and wrapped with a bandage works surprisingly well. Thinking in ASL uses similar areas of the brain as thinking in a spoken language; however, it is not actually English. Some words are similar, but many words involve thoughts or relationships that are hard to express in English. After a full month of thinking in ASL and communicating in ASL, she should be prepared. With her self-enforced deafness and fully sign-language thoughts, she should be able to sail through the hall in complete silence, at least as far as the priests can hear. In fact, if they rely entirely upon hearing thoughts, she may even be invisible to them! Even better, if they do eventually put two and two together and realize it was Alice that swiped the artifact, they will be looking for a deaf woman, throwing them off the scent entirely. All Three As with any camouflage, more is almost always better. Using ASL to mask thoughts, removing the words "thief," "catch/caught," "kill," etc. from her mind, and quoting long passages can all stack together, resulting in a multi-layer deception that is almost impossible to detect, let alone decipher. Once Alice has learned sign language and tricked he mind into using the 'wrong' words, all she needs to do is sign (that is, use sign language to communicate) a long memorized passage, swipe the artifact, sign a different passage, and retreat with due haste! 

If you're ok with a little magic or handwavium, you could have the arrow equipped with a device that attempts to create matter by comverting energy. In doing so, it would draw in tons of heat from the surrounding area. The matter created would be nanoscopically small, but all the heat in a radius around the impact point would be gone, thus you'd have a sphere of solidified air surrounding the target, which would also be frozen. The air would thaw quickly enough, varying slightly with the surrounding temperature. It'll give off a really cool steam as well, as the air goes back to a gaseous state. In contrast, a human target would remain frozen longer than the air, since the freezing point is so much higher. This may not be what you're looking for, as it's not exactly an endothermic reaction, but it is a potential soft-science way to make a freezer arrow. 

Determine gravity $(g)$ in distance units per time units squared. (Often meters per second squared, or feet per second squared) Determine initial horizontal velocity $(Vx0)$ and initial vertical velocity $(Vy0)$. This is how fast you're going when you first jump, which is determined by lots of factors in muscles and such. Set $Sx(t) = Vx0 * t + Sx0$, and$Sy(t) = -(g/2) * t^2 + Vy0 * t + Sy0$, where S0 is starting hieght. (If starting on the ground, you can often set S0 to 0) Combine the functions into a vector function, with the points $(Sx(t), Sy(t))$. 

Energy storage If you cool a rock to exactly one degree below freezing, then drop it in a nice beverage, the brick will cool the beverage... a little. But not very much, in the grand scene of things. However, if you drop a simple ice cube into the beverage, it will lower the temperature considerably! Same mass of object, but a lot more energy. The reason is the state change - the brick stays a brick, but the ice cube melts, and it takes a lot of energy to go from solid to liquid (and from liquid to gas), and vice versa. Incidentally, this is why those drink-rocks just don't work as well as regular ice. Granted, that's just water. It can hold a significant amount of energy, but you're not going to get it as small as an urn and still be able to do anything but act as a personal cooling device for a few hours, at best. What you really want, therefore, it a new supermaterial. Something that takes a lot of energy to go from solid to liquid. Then, all you need to do is find a way to get the energy into the substance (to make it warmer), or let the energy out (to make it cooler). The awesome part is that the temperature is exact. Not "vaguely room temperature", but a specific temperature with 0% fluctuation. Temperature control Ok, so I lied. There's a little bit more to controlling temperature than the material. However, this works to our advantage! You see, if you increase pressure, water no longer freezes at the same temperature. Increase it enough, and water starts freezing at room temperature (or hotter). Decrease it enough, and water boils at room temperature (or colder). Why is this to our advantage? Simple! Your supermaterial is at the solid/liquid state change at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. But, by increasing or decreasing the pressure, you can easily change the melting/freezing point by a few degrees up or down. Which means your supermaterial can be regulated at the twist of a dial! As you crank it one way, it increases pressure, the other way, decreases. Turn it up or down to regulate how much energy is released. Recharging As energy-dense as this material is, it will take significant energy to recharge - exactly the energy it lets out, actually. However, with the right material and a good source of energy, a chunk of material could heat an insulated house for a full day, or longer! And since it isn't wasting energy trying to make a house colder than it should be (like a giant block of ice), or warmer than it should be (like a vat of molten salt), it will regulate much more easily. 

Ultimately, it would all depend on what you want for your fictional world. Is this some Amazonian island in a male-dominated world, or is female-army the worldwide norm? Is the female birthrate something that society engineers, or something natural? If the Amazonian army wins and starts to take over the world, do they dominate the gene pool or do the Amazonian genes become watered down? 

There are numerous ways that evolution can select for specific traits. Evolutionary biologists often describe these sorts of pressures as The Four F's: fighting, fleeing, feeding, and... reproducing. Others have already mentioned a number of situations describing these pressures in action. Camouflage is likely to be a defensive strategy (i.e. fleeing) though a well-hidden hunter might also find it useful (i.e. feeding). Meanwhile bright plumage might promote social status and/or attract mates (i.e. reproducing). If you have a desired color in mind, simply imagine a scenario where this coloration would help that creature survive and have offspring by improving it's chances according to one of the Four F's. 

Critters reproduce Critters overpopulate and begin generating stress chemicals Super-stressed critters chase the rest into the sea Surviving critters begin repopulating 

Finally, we come to the last chapter of the monster movie: the military's deus ex machina weapon. This is a nuke, another monster, a really big sword, the common cold - something that could easily destroy the monster, but hasn't been used before for... reasons. Of course, the teenage aliens don't want their monster destroyed, so they pack as many real weapons into as possible to combat this weapon. I would suggest: 

The Foo are, simply, boring. Extending the forest analogy, the Foo are the towering redwoods, the biggest, best thing around. As time goes on, the trees just keep growing; while at first they reach towards the heavens, eons later they are surrounding entire suns to capture the energy. A Dyson sphere, after all, is at its soul merely a really efficient tree - using the energy of the sun to grow. The Foo continue to evolve, but the pressure for evolution isn't the base survival of the bushes and plants of the forest floor; it's simply that they need to be big enough to live forever. While tiny plants must do all sorts of tricky things to survive, the big trees ignore them entirely. They are neither fast nor curious. Inventions come through working through all possible methods of moving from point A to point B; iterative design gives perfect results if you keep working for a thousand years. The Foo aren't apex predators; they only need light and heat to survive. They don't hunt. They may not even forage. They live for thousands, maybe even millions of years. The dead rocky worlds they expanded to, have been terraformed into mild, pleasant city-worlds, populated with a people whose single-minded goal is to live forever, as efficiently as possible. It's not that they haven't discovered war, or other sentient life; it's that wars are over so quickly, and sentient life dies out so fast, that they never really even notice them. Like redwoods ignoring a wolf, the Foo don't even register other races as anything more than present. And then they walk into the Bar (sorry, couldn't resist). The Bar are a war machine, burning planets and harvesting the energy, eating everything they can. They are the Spinosaurus, the Great White Shark, and the polar bear, all wrapped up in one: the ultimate apex predator. Now, trees are efficient; they don't need to be a thousand feet taller than their neighbor to get the most sun, just a few inches. Predators, however, go overboard. A polar bear doesn't need to be as big as it is to catch a few fish; that might be what it chooses to eat today, but only because it's so big it can eat anything it wants. Suddenly, the mighty trees are threatened by a species willing to torch a forest to eat some squirrels. A species that is inefficient, overpowered, and hungry. The Bar are willing to destroy anything to get the resources they need, and that includes the Foo. Like trees versus a T-Rex with flamethrower arms, they are bewildered and frightened. They can't wait a thousand years to iterate over the designs for a plan to fend off the Bar; they need a solution now. They don't have the imagination to even realize what they could use to protect themselves; the usual choices are "grow taller" and "grow thicker bark", neither of which can be done quickly. Even in the most dire situations of their past, facing fire, pests, and famine, the Foo only needed to be strong enough to weather through. Now, survival may not even be an option. The actual problem may not be directly related to their own, immediate death; it may be that the Bar are testing technology capable of ending the universe, or preying on the life forms that sustain the Foo, or using energy too inefficiently and hastening the heat death of the universe. Or, maybe, the Bar are actually the first sentient life the Foo have encountered, and they simply have no idea how to interact. So what can they do? The Foo turn to all those tiny plants they have ignored since ages past. Using the absolutely foreign evolve-or-die mentality of the tricky little brush plants, they simulate high-speed realities, evolving digital sentient life that has to struggle to survive against predators and life forms encroaching on their energy. Hundreds of realities, all focused on one goal: avoiding extinction. 

Additional Options Echolocation (Back-scatter) Of course, you might be very loose with your definition of vision in the original post. If you're simply asking for another sense similar to vision without needing that sense to be particularly long-ranged, then echolocation is one possibility employed by Earth creatures which could be sci-fi adapted to other methods of propagation. Rather than the usual auditory clicking noises used by bats and dolphins, any combination of particles could be used in a similar "ping-then-listen manner to help understand an area. If the particles in question were photons of X-ray wavelength, then the alien would essentially work like an X-ray backscatter machine found in airports. Unfortunately, the return-trip timeframe for electromagnetic signals is extremely fast, so 3D imaging is unlikely to arise from photon-based detection, though a series of 2D images can create a good guess if you have enough differently-positioned eyes generating pictures to compare/contrast. Electrons or neutrons could be similarly used, though these pings would potentially cause a significant amount of damage (as the animal basically would be shooting electrons out it's eye sockets like a scanning electric microscope, ditto neutrons). Furthermore, the backscatter is unlikely to be any significant fraction of the output beam. Either way these would be problems. (Let alone describing how a neutron-gun organ developed through natural selection.) Charge Sensitivity / Magnetic Sensitivity These abilitys occur to varying degrees among Earth creatures, but creating an alien that sees a nearby object by looking at its electric charge or mapping it's magnetic fields. To really investigate a surface would involve moving the sensors around to feel the maxima and minima of the fields- which starts looking more like touch than sight, however.
