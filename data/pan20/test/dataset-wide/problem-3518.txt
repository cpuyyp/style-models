Suppose I have a Marshallian demand function $x_M(p_x^0,p_y,m^0)$. As I understand it, Slutsky compensation is defined as $$T_S = \Delta p_x \cdot x_M(p_x^0,p_y,m^0)$$ Can someone explain why this compensation overcompensates the consumer? 

I was given a word problem. No formulas. So I set up the following equations: Demand Function \begin{equation} D(p) = a - p \end{equation} Cost Function: \begin{equation} c(q) = 9 + 10q \end{equation} Marginal Cost \begin{equation} MC = 10 \end{equation} I am supposed to find how much the man in the problem would produce for any value of $a$. But, without a production function, I am unsure how to determine how much he will produce. Specifically, suppose I write \begin{equation} R = pD(p) \end{equation} I can't then differentiate R by q to find marginal revenue. So how do I know how much he would produce? 

My Question: Can someone offer a more complete definition than the one given? Specifically make sure it improves upon the concerns I mentioned. 

Here I just picked some values. Red is $\alpha = \frac{1}{4}$, blue is $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$, black is $\alpha = \frac{3}{4}$ I understand how the steepness and flatness of the different curves change as I vary $\alpha$. But I am confused as to what $\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha} $ tells me about the graph. In particular, $\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha} $ is dependent on $\alpha$. So even though I know $\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha}$ tells me how much $MRS$ changes as I change alpha....changing $\alpha$ changes $\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha}$...so I am very confused! My Question What is $\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha}$ telling me about the graph? Since $\frac{\partial MRS}{\partial \alpha}$ is dependent on $\alpha$, how does this affect things? 

I'm working on a practice problem where I'm giving the following: Suppose a firm is a price-taker and can sell the good it produces at price $p$. There is more to the problem, but it is not relevant for my question. I am not given any more information about the market other than the firm is a price-taker. So it is therefore not a price-setter meaning the market is setting the price. I can imagine two scenarios under which a firm would not be a price-setter. (1) if there were perfect competition between sellers, the firm could not set a price. (2) Also, if there were only one buyer, the firm would not be able to set a price either since the buyer could refuse to buy until the price went low enough. My Question: Is there something that distinguishes price-taking due to competition between sellers from price-taking due to monopsony? How do I tell which one it is? 

I don't understand why the Marshallian and Hicksian demand have such different properties. Both are functions from $$\Bbb{R}^n_+ \times \Bbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \Bbb{R}_+^n$$both are solved using the method of Lagrangian multipliers. Yet the properties of the two are very different. Does anyone know of any resources that discuss these differences in depth and in an organized way? My professor has us using his lecture notes. These are a good introduction but just don't rigorously discuss the differences. 

Let $U(x,y)$ be a utility function. Suppose I have an indifference curve for which $U(x,y) = \bar{U}$. Then $dU = 0$ along the curve and I can rearrange to find the MRS. Suppose I have a monotonic transformation of my utility function. That is, some function $$W(x,y) = f(U(x,y))$$ $$f'(\cdot) > 0$$ Since it too is an indifference curve, $dW = 0$ and I can rearrange as follows $$\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{W_x}{W_y} = -\frac{f'(U(x,y))U_x}{f'(U(x,y))U_y} =-\frac{U_x}{U_y}$$ Thus, we observe MRS is invariant under monotonic transformation. My Question: Can someone explain what this means graphically? I don't get why the slope remains the same. Why does MRS remain the same but MU changes? 

I just don't understand this explanation at all and would like a better explanation. What does it mean to "specialize completely"? 

For both Slutsky transfer and Hicksian transfer, the only parameter changing in the problem is income $m$. You are adding money in the case of a price increase and removing money in the case of a price decrease. For Hicksian, this means $$T_H = e(p_x^f,p_y,v^o) - m$$ For Slutsky $$T_S = \Delta p x_M$$ To understand why Slutsky overcompensates but Hicksian does not, we need to think more carefully about them. Consider Hicksian compensation. The Hicksian transfer provides the consumer with just enough money to return to his original indifference curve. But he doesn't have enough to buy the original bundle. He only has enough to buy a bundle with the same utility level. This is the same point we would get if we solved $$\min p_x^f x + p_y y$$ subject to $$v^o = U(x,y)$$ In other words, the Hicksian transfer moves us to the bundle that solves that problem. So for this reason Hicks doesn't overcompensate. It is exactly the amount required given the final price and desired utility level. Hence, it is tangent. Now consider the Slutsky transfer. Algebraically, we can see it allows us to purchase the original bundle \begin{align*} y &= -\frac{p_x^f}{p_y} x + \frac{m + T_s}{p_y}\\ y &= -\frac{p_x^f}{p_y} x + \frac{m + p_x^f x - p_x^o x}{p_y}\\ p_y y &= -p_x^fx + m + p_x^f x - p_x^o x\\ p_y y &= m + - p_x^o x\\ p_y y + p_x^o x &= m \end{align*} So it restores the ability to purchase the original bundle. But this line doesn't have the same slope as our original budget constraint before the price change. This one is parallel to the Hicksian transfer. Yet we already established that the Hicksian transfer was the solution to the expenditure minimization problem and hence tangent. Given that we usually assume strictly convex curves, it must form a chord and thus have bundles that offer greater utility than the Hicksian transfer. Thus, the consumer can move to a higher indifference curve. And so Slutsky transfer overcompensates the consumer because we can now buy bundles on higher indifference curves than prior to the price increase. 

AVERAGE COST VS AVERAGE VARIABLE COST I have been sloppy about the distinction between AVC and AC up until now. I have avoided this distinction by assuming $FC = 0$. Now I will try to clarify this point by assuming $FC$ can be anything. Fixed costs ($FC$)are costs the firm pays that do not vary with the amount produced. For example, suppose I work for Uber and I buy a car. That money is spent and doesn't change with the amount I drive. But the amount of gasoline I consume does change as with the amount I drive. Costs that scale with production are known as variable costs ($VC(y)$). $$AC(y) = \frac{C(y)}{y}=\frac{VC(y) +FC}{y}= \frac{VC(y)}{y} + \frac{FC}{y}=AVC + AFC $$ Hyperbolic Behavior of AFC with y >0 As production goes up ($y\rightarrow \infty$), AFC goes down ($AFC \rightarrow 0$) in an inversely proportional fashion. But note, as production goes down ($y\rightarrow 0$), AFC goes to infinity ($AFC \rightarrow \infty$). Thus, the plot of AFC will always be a hyperbola unless $FC = 0$ in which case AFC is just 0. How does AFC affect AC? Without specifying $VC(y)$, we cannot know the behavior of $AC(y)$ as $y$ moves away from $0$. There will be some $y_{0}$ such that, for $y > y_{0}$, $AC(y)$ can essentially be anything. Of course, as $y \rightarrow 0$, $AC(y) \rightarrow \infty$. This is because AVC cannot be negative and so we are guaranteed any variable costs will not lower the average cost below AFC. Therefore, $AVC \geq 0$, so since $AFC \rightarrow \infty$ as $y\rightarrow 0$ (remember it is a hyperbola), thus AC must go to infinity as well. Thus, since the behavior of fixed costs are always known, AVC is the missing ingredient needed to specify the behavior of AC. AC and AVC can't be exactly equal for $FC>0$ Since $AFC \rightarrow 0$ but does not ever equal 0 (for $FC >0$), we know that $$AC \neq AVC$$ for any $y$ and $FC >0$. But since $AFC$ approaches 0 for large enough $y$, AC approaches AVC asymptotically. AC and AVC can't be exactly parallel for $FC>0$ If $AVC$ and $AC$ are parallel, then their derivatives should be equal. But notice that $$\frac{dAFC}{dy} = -\frac{FC}{y^2}$$ so $$\frac{dAC}{dy} = \frac{dAVC}{dy} + \frac{dAFC}{dy} = \frac{dAVC}{dy} - \frac{FC}{y^2} \neq \frac{dAVC}{dy}$$ So they aren't parallel because their derivatives aren't equal. That said, for large enough $y$, the derivatives will be very close to each other so they may appear nearly parallel over some portion of the curves. MC intersects AC at minimum point of AC curve See Alecos's answer. MC intersects AVC at minimum point of AVC curve Consider the average variable cost curve. Find $y^*$ that solves $$\min_{y} AVC(y)$$ So at this point, $$\frac{dAVC(y^*)}{dy^*} = 0$$ This means by quotient rule $$\frac{VC'(y^*)y^*-VC(y^*)}{(y^*)^2} = 0$$ and since $y^*$ can't be 0, this implies $$VC'(y^*)y^*-VC(y^*)=0$$ which rearranged gives $$VC'(y^*)=\frac{VC(y^*)}{y^*}$$ Recall, $$C(y) = FC + VC(y)$$ Note, since $FC$ is a constant, $$C'(y) = VC'(y)$$ Therefore, $$C'(y^*) = \frac{VC(y^*)}{y^*}$$ EXTRA STUFF Why do we define the firm's longrun shutdown point in terms of average cost not marginal cost? Recall a firm's profit function is $$\pi = py - C(y)$$ I am not defining the behavior of $p$ here or who controls $p$. I am just considering for what $p$ will the firm shut down, and ignoring everything else because it's irrelevant. So we can easily see that since $$AC(y)= \frac{C(y)}{y}$$ for $p=AC(y)$, this yields $$\pi = \left(\frac{C(y)}{y}\right)y - C(y) = C(y)- C(y) = 0$$ So the firm will shut down if $p <AC(y)$ because then $\pi < 0$. So consider the function $C(y) = y^3$. Note, $$MC = 3y^2 > AC = y^2$$ We know the firm profit maximizes at $MR = MC$. So since, for $y > 0$, $MC(y) > AC(y)$, the firm would always produce if $p = MC$ since this would mean for $y>0$, $$ MC(y)y-C(y) = \pi_{p=MC} > \pi_{p=AC} = \left(\frac{C(y)}{y}\right)y - C(y) =0$$ $$\pi_{p=MC} > \pi_{p=AC} = 0$$ So, for this $C(y)$, at $p=MC$, $\pi >0$ for all $y$. So this example clearly shows you would never shut down at $p=MC$ for $y>0$ for $C(y) = y^3$. Although this isn't the most thorough explanation, this example clearly invalidates that train of thought and makes clear firms shut down for $p< AC$ Does average cost necessarily equal marginal cost at some point? See Alecos's answer. Takeaway Rules 

What is elasticity of substitution? Elasticity is by how much % one thing changes relative to a % change in another. Therefore, in this case, it is % change in ratio of two goods relative to a single % change in the $MRS$ for those two goods. 

In long run, firms produce if $p \geq AC(y)$. They shut down for $p < AC(y)$ Firms always produce at $MR = MC$ 

For simplicity, let's consider the trajectory marked A which is in the northwest corner of this diagram. In this location, supposedly $K_{t+1}<K_t$ and $C_{t+1}>C_t$. But how does one show this? Up to this point, all I have seen is that "supposedly" this trajectory veers off, but I don't see how it necessarily does so. Let $$C_t = K_t^\alpha + (1-\delta)K_t - K_{t+1}$$ My Quesiton Can someone explain why A veers off towards the NW direction? Specifically, why must $K_{t+1}<K_t$ and $C_{t+1}>C_t$? 

Suppose initially there are no fixed costs. What does it mean to take an average? Consider a cost function $C(y)$. What does it mean to take the “average” of this function? Mathematically, it is just $$A(y) = \frac{c(y)}{y}$$ Let’s suppose we are considering $C(y) = y^3$. Suppose we now consider $y = 5$. Then $$A(5) = \frac{5^3}{5} = 25 $$ This is just saying that, for each unit I buy, I am buying them at $25$ each on average. So I could have paid $$ \frac{15 + 39 + 46 + 14 + 11}{5}$$ or $$ \frac{17 + 3 + 78 + 23 + 4}{5}$$ What information does the average cost give us? The 'cost per unit' given by an average cost function isn't like taking an average by adding up the cost of each unit we bought. When we are given a cost function $C(y)$, this just tells me the total cost. I don't know how much my first TV cost me from this equation alone. And the average doesn't tell me that either. Note how above we have two sets of 5 TVs that yielded the same average cost. Thus, the average cost function doesn't tell me how much I paid for each specific TV. What does marginal cost tell me? This is exactly what marginal cost provides. Marginal cost provides the specific cost of each successive infinitesimal amount of good. Consider again $C(y) = y^3$. $$MC(y) = \frac{d C(y)}{d y}= 3y^2$$ Suppose I have purchased $3.5$ units of TV. Then the MC equation thus says, for $c(y) = y^3$, each additional infinitesimal amount of TV costs me $$3(3.5)^2 = 36.75$$ at that point. If I purchase an additional $0.1$ amount of TV, then my MC changes and now I am at $$3(3.6)^2 = 38.88$$ Thus, this concept is a bit trickier because it involves a continuous amount of TV and the cost per infinitesimal unit changes as you buy more. So you really can't just consider how much $MC(1)$ is and $MC(2)$ is. You are considering it for some infinitesimal additional amount $dy$ at a given point (e.g. $y=2$). The trend is easier to think through if you don't restrict yourself to integers. Note, we are assuming you can have noninteger quantities of goods, otherwise we wouldn't be working in $\Bbb{R}^n$ and the integration later might be trickier. Example to Clarify Marginal Cost So suppose I want to buy $5$ TVs. For the $k$th TV purchased, the $$MC(k)= 3k^2$$ Going back to our example above, let's now suppose $k \in [0,5]$. To find the average cost, we simply do the addition formula used above for the 5 TV example, except now summed over each infinitesimal amount (of which there are an infinite number). This gives us $$A(5) = \frac{3(0)^2+\cdots + 3k^2+ \cdots + 3(5)^2}{5} = \frac{\int_{0}^{5} 3y^2 dy}{5}= \frac{(125-0)}{5}=\frac{c(5)}{5}=25$$ $$A(5) =25$$ the same as we calculated earlier. Summary Marginal Cost is $$MC(y) = \frac{d C(y)}{d y}$$ Average variable cost is $$A(y) = \frac{\int_{0}^{y} MC(y) dy}{y}$$ Note, since we assumed $FC = 0$, this formula also thus defines AC but would not be true for $FC \neq 0$. 

Consider Solow growth model. Let $s$ denote savings rate. Suppose we estimate China invests 40% of it GDP rather than consuming. Assuming China is dynamically inefficient because they are a developing nation, how can I estimate what it's $s_{gold}$ is? Furthermore, how do I decide whether China is at this $s_{gold}$ versus some other $s$? Furthermore, how does one determine this in general? Like are there distinct characteristic patterns that allow me to understand these rates? Let our production function be $Y_t = (A_tL_t)^{1-\alpha} K_t^{\alpha}$. I am asking how one calculates $s$ and $s_{gold}$ in practice, as in, if I had to find realistic numbers for these how would I do it? 

Marginal Cost is $$MC(y) = \frac{\partial C(y)}{ \partial y}$$ Average Cost is $$AC(y) = \frac{ C(y)}{ y}$$ Average Variable Cost is $$AVC(y) = \frac{VC(y)}{ y}$$ Note: Cost is $$ C(y) = FC + VC(y)$$ I don’t understand what the differences are. Like I understand the definition of cost function, fixed costs, and variable costs, but I don’t get how marginal cost, average cost, and average variable costs are related. Can someone explain? 

TRAIN OF THOUGHT 1: From what I understand, $MRS$ is calculated as $$dU = U_x dx + U_y dy =0$$ which by rearrangement yields $$\frac{dy}{dx}= -\frac{U_x}{U_y}$$ So suppose I have $$U(x,y) = \ln x +\ln y$$ Then $$ \frac{dy}{dx}= -\frac{1/x}{1/y} = -\frac{y}{x}$$ Okay. So I have a function $y$ in terms of $x$. TRAIN OF THOUGHT 2: Now consider my $U(x,y)$ again. Let $$\mathbf{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 1\\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$U(\mathbf{a})=0$$ We have $$DU(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{x} & \frac{1}{y} \end{bmatrix} $$ and $$\frac{\partial U}{\partial y} (\mathbf{a}) = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{y}\end{bmatrix}= 1$$ which is nonsingular since $\det(1) = 1$ and so by the Implicit Function Theorem, $$U = 0$$ defines $y$ implicitly as a function of $x$ in a neighborhood of $\mathbf{a}$. My Question: How are these two trains of thought connected? The first is stated in terms of differentials. But the second is not. So I am confused why the definition of $MRS$ follows from the implicit function theorem. 

I keep seeing the terms first-order conditions and second-order conditions used in my undergrad economics class on production functions, monopolies, etc but I have no idea what these terms mean. It seems like a completely ambiguous term. What kind of conditions? Can someone explain what these terms mean? If it is context dependent, provided some of them most elementary meanings you associate with the term. 

My professor says the expenditure function and the indirect utility function are inverses of each other. But how is this possible? Consider each. $$v:(p_x,p_y,m) \rightarrow \Bbb{R}$$ $$e:(p_x,p_y,\bar{U}) \rightarrow \Bbb{R}$$ These are both mappings from $\Bbb{R^3}\rightarrow \Bbb{R}$. How can one be the inverse of the other? Only if one was a scalar field and the other a vector field would this work. My Question: What is the relationship between the expenditure minimization function and the indirect utility function? 

The Solow growth model defines $$k_t \equiv \frac{K_t}{A_t L_t}$$ Let our production function be Cobb Douglas $$Y_t = K_t^\alpha (A_t L_t)^{1-\alpha}$$ We have $$A_t = A_0 e^{gt}$$ $$L_t = L_0 e^{nt}$$ We find the steady state is $$k^* = \left(\frac{s}{n+ g + \delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ At the steady state, we notice $$\frac{K_t}{L_t} = A_t k_t = A_0 e^{gt} \left(\frac{s}{n+ g + \delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ My Question Does $$\frac{K_t}{A_t} = L_t k_t = L_0 e^{nt} \left(\frac{s}{n+ g + \delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ also grow at the steady state? In several lecture notes I found online, no one discusses this so I wanted to clarify. Follow Up But if $\frac{K_t}{L_t}$ and $\frac{K_t}{A_t}$ both grow this way, then $$K_t = A_0 e^{gt} L_0 e^{nt} \left(\frac{s}{n+ g + \delta}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ So does this mean $K_t$ is a function of these parameters (e.g. $A_0$) or is this not a valid economic expression?
