Quine's short 1954 paper, Quantification and the Empty Domain (Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol 19 Number 3 September 1954), addresses this. Quines two reasons are: 

One of the most fundamental debates in the philosophy of mathematics is a debate about what mathematics is. Your question ("What makes an object mathematical?") might be understood directly from understanding, "What is mathematics?" I would therefore suggest you begin by reading the SEP's list of the four main schools of thought. Each school answers the question differently. For example, to a logicist, an object is mathematical if it is simply a statement in some logical system. Thus, the first and third of your examples are certainly mathematics, and the second might be also if "socrates", "mortal", and "man" were axiomatically defined. A statement is mathematical if its content (meaning) can be defined in purely logical terms. Bertrand Russell defined mathematics thus: 

I am addressing the question in a rather indirect way as I believe there's no resolute direct answer. For example: the assumed clearest evidence of any type on this topic is Libet's experiment. Nevertheless, I would agree with the criticisms on it and his own view rather than with a variety of bestowed conclusions. Libet "believes subjects still have a "conscious veto", since the readiness potential does not invariably lead to an action"(Wikipedia) My answer is freewill has too many different versions of definition, each with its own ground and purpose. Besides it requires insights from Neurology and psychiatry which have not reached maturity sufficiently enough to have a resolute thesis. Philosophy appears to be the only way for thought experiments but you can't set aside theological sides of it. 

We could classify AI in an infinite number of other ways; some based on outcome, others based on how it works on a technical level. Here are some examples: Strong and Weak AI Your first 'School' of AI is probably Artificial general intelligence "(AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies." This is also known as Strong AI. Your second 'school' of AI is known as a 'Expert Systems' which are defined as a system designed to emulate the decision making of a human expert in a specific domain. For instance, Deep Blue, the famous chess 'AI' is an Expert System in the domain of Chess; it emulates the decisions of human Chess experts. this is also known as Weak AI, and Narrow AI. In this system, we are defining AI based on whether or not it possesses human-like cognitive abilities. Communication Ability You could classify AI into groups of those that can pass the Turing Test and those that cannot. One isn't necessarily better than the other; i.e. just because something does not communicate to humans doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. What 'Type' of 'Mind' it has You can classify AI into what I would describe as what 'type' of 'mind' it has: 

In general, others have pointed out nothing prevents happiness to come with moral duty fulfillment. On the other side, we pick up a life risk to analyze, other kinds of risks vary at great scales and should not be treated the same. To risk someone's life to perform moral duties is counter-intuitive and counter-instinct. It roots from the question: what is/are more (valuable) than a life? An easy answer might be "many lives are"!!! Hang on a minute, are you serious? Based on what metric system or criteria? are those many lives of the same kind of the referenced life and how same? who is/are the judge?... such kind of questions will push the initiator back at the wall with noway out. Life is the most complicated concept in any areas of study. Therefore to discuss or make statements about it requires a lot more than just a few quotes. 

You can't really identify a logical fallacy unless someone makes a claim, and the only claim your question describes is this: 

The problem you're having with that statement is that it's ambiguous. I suggest the follow two possible interpretations of your statement, one of which is impossible, one is completely valid. I believe to understand it, you need to specify which meaning you mean. 

E.g. A = American Females, B = 'White', C = American Politicians An American Female is probably White, An American Politician is probably White, Therefore A Female American Politician is probably White Is obviously not necessarily true. Unless you add something like "American female politicians are probably white" 

Dawkins presents this hypothetical argument without providing concrete examples of people actually using it. It is probably no coincidence, that even if has heard the argument used, he paraphrased it here in such a way that it is perfectly destroyed by his pre-prepared counter-argument, this is a classic straw-man. 

A cone is a sum of infinitely many cross sections. If we cut the cone at one cross section, the cross section above it and the cross section below it must be either the same size, or different. (2a) If they are different, then the cone must change size significantly at this exact cut, i.e. it has a "step", which seems false. (2b) If they are the same, then every cross section is the same as the next one, so no cross section can differ in size from any other cross section, and so the cone is indistinguishable from a cylinder. This seems false as well. 

If some first-order statement is true in every domain larger than a domain D, then it is true in D. But this is only true if D is not the empty set. Philosophically, we want our statements to be true of all sufficiently large domains of discourse, but this theorem says that including finite ("small") domains of discourse does not change things. However, including the empty domain of discourse would change things. It's easy to tell anyway whether a first-order statement is true for the empty domain. So it seems unnecessary to include this in our theory when we can just handle it as a special case. 

You will, between you, confirm that 2 is a prime number. *: : By my definition 2x1 and 1x2 are 1-dimensional lines, not rectangles, and maps to our other definition of 'only divisible by 1 and itself'. If you think these are rectangles, you could add "... rectangle with both sides > 1 to the definition" 

Almost all scientific theories are taken 'for granted' we don't have to re-test them every time we come to a conclusion that relies upon them being true. I.e. if I want to test whether Ball A is bouncier than Ball B, I assume that the laws of motion apply equally to both balls, and that acceleration due to gravity is the same for both, etc.. 

Your confidence in h1 will increase as you discover A that are B (and fail to discover any A that are not B) Your confidence in h2 will increase as you approach time t and fail to observe any A that are not B You may never observe any evidence of A becoming not B before t, so, in the absence of evidence, your confidence in h3 remains the same. 

Firstly, symmetry is only absolute in Math, not in Math-Physics (search for Closer to Truth interview videos on Symmetry). So while putting a physical coin in distribution of flips, it's the jurisdiction of Math-Physics hence no good sense. Nevertheless, intuitively, the coin symmetry is only one among many parameters such as the surrounding air or liquid, electromagnetic fields, ... that if are stripped off, again makes little sense in terms of truths other than approximation. Clearly it's analytic. 

If you need a proof on this question, then it's fair, on a wider scale, to say nothing can be proved at all. What can you prove if you have no postulates? Or in other words, what are possible postulates for this case? In fact, no one has satisfactorily proved it through history. On the other hand, people do say "life is just a dream". It's not just casual, it has serious implications, especially on the ground of multi-life/reincarnation hypothesis. But anyway it stays a metaphor subject to interpretations. 

Have a friend sit on the other side of a curtain with a box of tokens. have them pick a number of tokens (x) but not tell you how many they have picked. Ask them if they can form a rectangle with those tokens. Repeat the experiment, ensuring that at some point they choose 2 tokens 

i.e. if you had two stones, you cannot arrange them into rows and columns to form a rectangle; therefore two is a prime number. Unless you can find a way to make 2 stones form a rectangle, it is a prime number. We can use this to address the 'philosophy' aspect of your question, you are effectively attacking the 'divisible by other numbers' aspect of your definition of prime, however my definition dispenses entirely with the concept of dividing by anything, and still gives us a complete list of 'prime numbers' which includes '2'. Even in a theoretical universe where the number of numbers less than x is indeterminable (i.e. there may or may not be numbers less than x) it is still possible to independently verify whether or not x is prime using this method, therefore the 'primeness' of 2 can be verified regardless of the fact there are no whole numbers between 1 and 2 In fact, we can prove this is in our own mundane universe with an experiment: 

I would summarize this to say that there are clearly practical reasons to exclude the empty domain; this isn't to say that these reasons are natural, but I would guess Quine is more concerned about what is practical than about what is natural. In R. M. Martin's 1965 Of Time and the Null Individual, it is actually proposed that we introduce a "null individual" to our logic. As best I can tell, the effect of this is that the empty domain can be discussed, and that essentially the same logical theorems hold true for the empty domain as held in classical first-order logic. Whether you consider this to be justification for leaving the empty domain out in the first place is another matter. Perhaps the "null individual" is little more than an artificial way of making the empty set behave as if it were nonempty. But perhaps it makes sense philosophically to say there must always be a null individual x for which statements such as Px and Qxx can be written, even if we do not assume that this null individual actually exists; in this way we avoid the problems the empty domain could pose for logic, but at the same time we avoid assuming a priori that at least one thing exists (for the whole point of the null individual is that it is not considered to exist). There is some other discussion in A Note on Truth, Satisfaction and the Empty Domain, Timothy Williamson, 1999. 

It rather depends on you than on the book or things therein. When you find a matching between your mind or soul's ingredients and the interpretants from the book (For interpretant - Refer C.S Pierce on Semiotic), the chance of being convinced increases and so on. God to each soul is likely to be different in some way, despite many could think they are worshiping the same God. So it doesn't matter it's true or at least convinced to others as well. Such matching is sufficient to make you convinced. In another way, even if others are convinced, you may be not - no matchings or not sufficiently. 

Firstly, the two English words can be understood differently through times and geographies. For example, eudaimonia means literally well-classed spirit and is translated as "happiness". The difference is too remarkable. "Pleasure" in hedonism can be used interchangeably with "happiness". So it is safe as long as concerned in philosophy, no clear lines are important. It depends on your philosophical position to go further into concepts such as eudaimonia, provided they are not precisely "happiness". You can't understand a theist being atheist.
