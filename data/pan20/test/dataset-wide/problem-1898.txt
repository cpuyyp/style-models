There could've been more supervision The developer probably over-committed himself and thus couldn't meet his goals. 

At the risk of dehumanizing your relationships with these contacts, I'll recommend keeping a lot of interaction restricted to an integrated communications suite. In a typical work environment, email and IM are the primary forms of communication. Keeping all your correspondence with each contact accessible via an email or IM thread is a fairly basic way of tracking your relationships with these contacts. Your mastery of a specific email tool will be key here. Take your standard MS Outlook for example which offers: 

I'll answer as one that just pretty recently took a position in a gigantic company that offered me the same choice. I'm a somewhat accomplished enterprise developer and integrator in the JEE space and I was interviewed based on my skillset and experience, hell the position was advertised as an enterprise developer role. Then came the interview 

Given the state of things, I'll recommend a plain resignation letter/email with the standard niceties : "I've learnt a lot working here", "Thank you for the opportunity" etc. Stick to the notice period stipulated in whatever hiring contract you signed and steel your mind to resist any bullying from your boss. If the notice period is two weeks, you're giving two weeks, not an hour more. What's she going to do about it? Your exit interview (if there is one) however is where the difference should count. You should have coherent, constructive feedback to give about your manager's style and the working environment she creates. Even in the less than cordial parting, you're still better off not burning any bridges. Bow out with class 

I wouldn't call it an apology letter; rather a letter of thanks. It may be difficult to send an apologetic letter without "tugging at heart strings" or seeming like you're making excuses. I'd instead recommend sending a letter of thanks; thanking them for the opportunity to interview for the position. You may then insert an aside that while you were very excited to interview for the position, you realize the interview didn't go the way either of you planned, mostly due to the condition you suffered. You're quite surprised and mildly disappointed in the way thing panned out would like to apologise for the time spent/lost. Not an excuse, just an observation of fact, on the way the interview panned out. 

After about 6 interviews with a big MNC that included an IQ test and a personality/behavioral assessment with some sort of shrink, the MNC extended a "verbal" offer, complete with pay, PTO and benefits structuring. Based on this, I turned down two other offers from smaller companies. Two days later, MNC informs my recruiter that they've run into funding issues regarding my specific position so they're unable to extend a formal offer letter. I was first irritated that such a huge shop will go headhunting without first securing the funds and after making me jump thru so many hoops, and reassuring me I was safe to consider them provisional employers (turning down other offers). I've since moved on. Fast forward a month later, they're back, and whispering sweet nothings. I already have a gig I'm quite happy with. I should mention however that this MNC has a very unique niche of the finance market and offers experience and training I will almost certainly not get anywhere else and working for them (prior to their SNAFU) and getting that training/experience was a dream. Would I be daft to consider them at this point, having been burnt by them once on what seemed to be a no-brainer? 

Force of Habit While time could serve to improve skill, the mere fact of having carried out a task (or group of related tasks) will inevitably result in your proficiency at it. Take any profession. Plumbing, wine-tasting. While you may not have grown in skill in 7 years at a plumber, you'd have stared at so many elbow pipes that you can give details about it that a rookie won't have, simply because he hasn't seen enough pipes. In the technology field, spending enough years with a piece of technology will inevitably result in you experiencing some corner case that would be unlikely for anyone else. You've implemented a framework so many times you've covered most of the gotchas and pitfalls. Lessons learnt Employers looking for experienced hands know what they're doing. When most of us are starting out, all we have is textbook experience. Anyone who's been in the field for a while will tell you that theory doesn't always translate well into practice. Mistakes will be made. Bugs will be introduced in stable codebases. You will without a at least once. These are mistakes that your first employer or two will have to suffer. The employer that wants 5 years experience expects these mistakes of a newbie and won't want to be the one to take the hit. They expect that at 5 years, some other poor shop has paid the blood price of your goofs. 

As far as changing management's attitude, it might be a long shot. I'd start with empowering the marginalized teachers in what little way I can: The deaf teachers are put under the supervision of the hearing teachers, a disablement by itself. Why not start by just easing off on your deaf colleagues and letting them take the reins, without looking insubordinate? By giving them back that control, you're going a long way in showing them your support and belief in their abilities, in spite of management's heads-up-their-you-know-where-ness. At the end of the day, I'm usually satisfied and content in the fact that my team mates have my back (and traditionally, it's always been an paradigm btw senior management and the rest of us). Keep at the back of your mind tho, for management's purposes, you're accountable. 

From the background you've given on this question, It looks like it's just you, (the employee/employees) that feel management has painted itself into a corner. Has management sought anyone other than management's own input on the situation ( if they even feel this a situation)? Have they attempted to even bribe you guys by maybe throwing in more equipment or something? An awful, saddening lot can be inferred from a move such as we have here, about that shop's Mgmt No good deed goes unpunished. Don't give unsolicited advice to a group of people who so readily threw employee satisfaction to the wolves for the sake of the Almighty Buck. If you really feel that strongly about it though, HR is your first port of call, as a group. Don't go in there alone or be singled out as the one facing the opposite direction in the march of progress. Ask your HR contact if there is anything at all that can be done or if they feel mgmt will be willing to compromise by adding and removing an hour in either direction or designating an hour after lunch as gym time or something. 

There is no obvious need to take sides (and can only end in resentment if either party finds out you did) 

Again, think long term. And try not to be grabby. You can't expect to mine a contact for all possibilities after the first meet. Typically you'll only get to second base after the 2nd-3rd meet. Impatience sets in when you're expecting short-term turnaround on a contact (see my first point) and you have too many of them in the first place. Pace yourself and invest yourself in someone you have a solid link with. So to summarize, 

You need to eat, no? It depends on your company culture and politics. We'd all expect to be treated like adults at our workplaces but if the questions we see up here are anything to go by, that's usually not the case. It should only be a problem if you're missing for 2 whole hours. 45 minutes to an hour and you're back promptly at your desk, you should not be hassled. Unless you're at a company that rates an employee's productivity by how much time they spend glued to their desks, I wouldn't worry about it. Spend no more than the allowed length time within the stipulated (if any) period of time and you should be fine. After all is said and done, even if you're in a less than mature working environment, you should still go to eat when you have to. Treating your lunch time as valuable ends up being your responsibility. If you don't , you set a risky precedent where your employer will randomly expect you to postpone or skip lunch on a whim 

In addition to the great answers here, "gaining visibility" IMO, is much more than the end result of being the popular kid in school. It encompasses skills you'll inevitably acquire the route to being loved by good, feared by evil: 

Find a medium (Not too invasive) that lets you stay on your contact's radar and possibly pop in some pleasantries from time to time. Ideally, such a medium should also let you stay abreast of your contact's activties (only in a way that concerns you anyway) and let's you share your interests with your contact. Yes, I've basically described social networking. LinkedIn has a great set of features (Sharing articles, endorsing skills etc) that allow you to do just this in a minimally intrusive manner At your conferences, don't shoot for quantity. Shoot for quality contacts, people you share interests with, with whom you have a connection. Relax and be yourself (to a large an extent as possible without looking unprofessional) Lose the "I'm here to meet people with whom I'll have a mutually beneficial relationship starting next week" outlook. Meet these people and give the contact time to mature and bear good fruit 

Marching up to everyone's desk first thing in the morning can easily make you come off as overbearing. Or just creepy. 

First you must disabuse yourself of the mindset that it's an interrogation; unless you've omitted some chunk of the question, it reads like a pretty straightforward request for feedback. You shouldn't be looking to escape the truth. I suspect that you may be distrusting of your manager, hence the need to either avoid responsibility or be otherwise not straightforward. State the facts as you perceive them. Regardless of your answer, your manager probably already has his own assessment of the situation. Meandering about the obvious will win you no points. Honesty and ownership of the situation, however, will. If however, you really need to absolve yourself of liability, you could use the time-honoured cop-out of: 

I applaud your bravery sir, but it's usually safer to start by introducing yourself (as the "New Guy") to the co-workers in your immediate vicinity, and then let job function help you cross other people's paths. Remember that 

Try not to come up to him empty handed: You've said that your walking away from the project might result in a reset for it. So, from your CTO's point of view, you might be abandoning an otherwise healthy ship and scuttling it on your way out. Don't do that. Either look for someone around you that you might (essentially) be able to pawn the project off of; Make sure that this person doesn't make the same mistake like you did i.e. not get paid for his/her time. Alternatively, you could recommend someone from outside your organization that may be available for hire Don't cut and run: When negotiating your inevitable exit, try to not sound like you're beating a hasty retreat. Rather, present it as a phased withdrawal, in which you're available to consult with and guide whoever takes on the task next. You're not abandoning the project, rather you're taking an increasingly more distant supervisory role.
