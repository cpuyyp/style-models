I'm not familiar with land-based methods, but for global measurements, one method is to use satellite altimetry (I'm more familiar with the geodesy side, but many of the same satellites are used). I think many of the current methods interpolate global or regional currents from a sparse network of buoys. As more radar satellites are launched, however, satellite measurements of sea surface currents will become more common. Global-scale satellite-based radar altimetry measures the average elevation of the ocean's surface over a few kilometers (the exact amount depends on the wavelength of the radar band being used). Over this distance, waves cancel out, so the measurement is accurate to within a few centimeters. (This is aided by using the motion of the satellite to enhance the image, referred to as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).) Surface currents in the ocean are directly related to the slope of the ocean's surface. (Again, at the scales we're working with, wind-formed waves cancel out.) Once you have an accurate snapshot of the elevation of the ocean, you can calculate the direction and magnitude of the surface currents. (Note that this is only the surface currents! Deep ocean currents are different matter altogether.) This is also how we coarsely map the ocean floor from space. (For example, Sandwell & Smith's extensive work: $URL$ The average elevation of the ocean's surface with respect to center of the Earth follows the geoid (by definition). Seamounts on the ocean floor cause a preturbation in the geoid above them. Water effectively "bunches up" around seamounts (or rather, the surface of gravitational equipotential "bunches up" above the seamount). By repeatedly measuring the oceans surface (over several years) we can remove the effect of surface currents and get an accurate picture of what the geoid looks like over the ocean. You can then use this to predict water depths over the oceans on a spatial scale of ~1 kilometer. In fact, to calculate surface currents, you need this information to begin with. The surface currents are calculated as deviations from this measurement of the geoid. 

This is a good question, but it really has a simple answer. How can you determine the depth of an object when you are not even calculating it? Triangulation uses circles, 2-D shapes, so when finding the solution to the equations of circles that solve all 3 circles, you only find X and Y. Z isn't even being solved for. Triangulation is not precise. In practice, we end up using much more than 3 stations and statistical methods to find the precise epicenter (and other methods to find the focus). 

This is a good question, and the basic answer is earthquake seismology. To answer this question, lets accept a fact: Waves propagate through the least time pathway, and not the least distance path. This property of physics is known as Fermat's principle. When an Earthquake occurs, energy propagates similar to a ripple of water, and spreads. Each point on this ripple can be modeled as a ray, each following its least time path through the Earth. As these rays propagate, they reflect and refract off heterogeneities inside the earth. These reflections are important: we can detect these reflections using surface seismometers. Using multiple seismometers, and the location of the source (earthquake), we can calculate the "lag" between when the closest seismometer detects the earthquake and the others(further from the source). This lag time can be used as a proxy for the depth of the reflected wave's heterogeneity. Using how deep this reflection originates, we can then figure out the least time path of the wave in terms of actual distance. Velocity is just distance over time, even for seismic waves. So since we have the distance traveled by the wave, and the time the wave took to get to the receiver, we can complete the equation (distance/time). In actual practice, this process is far more complex, as you have to look for many different waveforms: The picture above illustrates an earthquake sending waveforms through the earth. The SKS wave is a shear wave that refracts into the liquid outer core, turns into a compressional wave (since shear waves cannot propagate through liquid), and then is converted again to a shear wave as it enters the mantle and goes to the surface. A trained seismologist looks at the readings from seismometers to tease out specific waves, which we know the properties of, to determine properties of the planet's interior. The speeds of these waves are highly dependent on the assumed densities and other rock properties of the crust, mantle, and core. 

In addition to the answer above (and I realize this is an old question and perhaps better for world building), but what we know about climate, some subtle changes can have pretty big effects. If you increase the axial tilt a few degrees that would make the variation in sunlight winter to summer greater and would make colder winters and warmer summers, but the effect of warmer summers is that glaciers would have a harder time growing. You could also increase the planet's greenhouse gas. You could also create more ocean surface area and less land. Oceans are good temperature stabilizers and with strong ocean currents, you might get a year-round warm water flow towards the continent on the pole, leading to a warming of the land on the pole, much the same way Europe is warmer than similar latitudes in other places on earth, due to the warm mid Atlantic current. More ocean surface area and a strong oceanic conveyor might be the simplest explanation, creating a regular stream of warm air that blows onto your continent on the pole. Or you could give the planet a slower rotation and longer days (colder nights), but during the summer, snow would melt during the longer day - also preventing glacial buildup. For your scenario, glaciers on Mountains is fine, but you don't want glaciers spreading across land like we have in Greenland and Antarctica. For a warmer pole continent, you need some combination of effects that would prevent glacial growth. Glacial growth on land and a decline in oceanic circulation is thought to be the cause of the ice age period that began about 2.6 million years ago. Similarly, land over the pole is thought to be what lead to the Karoo ice age. You'd need a mechanism to make your land on the pole warmer (like some of the mechanisms above). On river runoff: River water usually (but not always) requires snow melt. If you have a lot of snow that melts over the year (like the Himalayas), that would create a lot of large rivers but I don't think those rivers would warm the land very effectively. Rivers respond to land temperature and snow/ice melt and weather patterns, more than they control them. Other methods like more greenhouse gas, a bigger ocean with a strong conveyor or some orbital changes are the best methods I can think of for your scenario. 

This is a very good question. There a few main heat sources: Heat(and work) left over from the formation of the earth, work (potential energy) generated by dense iron sinking into the center of the earth and forming a core, and radioactive energy. Since the Thermal diffusivity of the materials that make up the earth is low, heat transport is very slow and thus the planet retains a significant amount of its heat. Another reason why the earth is so hot, is that mantle convection is a very inefficient way to transport said heat, and thus the earth loses energy very slowly. We know how hot the interior of the earth might be because of laboratory experiments, and also volcanic eruptions. How much energy(temperature) does it take to melt gabbro (mantle rock)? Interestingly enough, the earth is cooling. And the inner core / outer core boundary is a freezing front (meaning turning from a liquid outer core to a solid inner core). Though, it is a very hot freezing front. 

However, for making detailed hydrological models, geophysical methods (particularly ground penetrating radar (GPR)) get used quite a bit. In fact, there's a whole field called "hydrogeophysics" that deals with imaging in near-subsurface environments. These methods don't get applied for locating a single well. They get applied to build detailed 3D models to constrain things like contaminant transport. If you need to know how groundwater is flowing in 3D, then you need a more detailed image of the subsurface than you do to locate a single water well. GPR is the most commonly used method, but I've seen almost every sort of geophysical data used in some cases (basically where it's already been collected and is freely available). Basically, the bigger the budget, the more fancy tools can get thrown at the problem. :) 

I'm not an ideal person to answer this, but that's never stopped me before, so here goes! :) I've helped several hydrologists with the geophysical side of things at various points, but I'm not in any form or fashion a hydrologist myself. My father did the government permitting for residential water wells and septic systems where I grew up, though, so I've seen a bit of things from both the academic side and the practical side. For locating the average residential water supply well, gephysical methods are basically never used. They're just too expensive compared to drilling the well. 

The electromagnetic field is modeled as a dipole, but in actuality has ~10% component that is off the dipole. The wandering of this dipole (and by consequence, off dipole) magnetic field causes a shear in opposite directions at the inner and outer core. This inner and outer core shear scales similarly at the edges (at the inner core outer boundary and at the core mantle boundary) but in opposite directions (so they are of the same magnitude). This torque, causes the flow of the inner core and the outer core to spin in opposite directions, as shown by the last figure. 

You ask what we should change to better predict earthquakes, and I'd think almost everything. As geophysicists we might know the what of earthquake detonation, but are relatively blind at the how. There is a strong group of scientists who feel that single event prediction is NOT a realistic goal, and may perhaps be impossible. Some good guesses as to why this is still a problem: 

A quick google search will answer this question for you. Read some of those, and if you still have questions, come back and ask. This really, really, really has been answered, again and again and again and again. If you have trouble, I can post some explanations for you. 

There's a number of things to consider, and, I'm just a layman who's read up on this a little as a hobby. 1) Solar wind and magnetic field. We've all heard about Mars losing it's atmosphere to the Solar wind. Young earth may have lost some of it's early atmosphere to the solar wind too - certainly some of the H2 in the chart in the original question. He as well. Earth's magnetic field formed some 3.5 billion years ago. The earth had to cool down enough for the inner core to become solid for the magnetic field to form. Also, that first 1.1 billion years of the solar system, the sun probobly had more frequent and stronger solar wind. Source: $URL$ So for the first 1.1 billion years, the Solar wind was probobly the primary factor in affecting the earth's atmosphere. Also, if we begin the study around the time of the formation of the moon, the late heavy bombardment likely also brought frozen gas to the earth. The young solar system was a chaotic place. Following the formation of the magnetic field and the end of the late heavy bombardment (some of those asteroids may have vaporized the entirety of the earth's oceans for a time), then life became the driving factor in atmospheric changes. Oxygen is the one we care about, but it wasn't the first. Early forms of photosynthesis probobly included sulfur and likely all of it took place in the oceans. There's not much dissolved gas in the oceans but there's enough that over hundreds of millions of years, this would have an effect. Needless to say, once Oxygen photosynthesis started, that had a bigger effect. Oxygen photosynthesis may have started around 2.7 billion years ago and that was huge in taking and using CO2 dissolved in the ocean (but ultimately from the atmosphere) and releasing O2. Source: $URL$ Initially the released O2 bonded with Iron dissolved in the oceans and later, when released into the atmosphere (about 2.3-2.4 billion years ago), it likely reacted with and removed any remaining CH4 (Methane) in earth's atmosphere and perhaps any NH3 (Ammonia). The dissolved O2 helped make the oceans clear but it also posed a problem for primitive bacteria that found dissolved oxygen far to reactive and this led to further evolution, life protecting itself from oxygen, and in time, this also lead to the ozone layer which helped early life move to the land. Oxygen was also useful in forming granite, which was lighter than Basalt and this created more permanent and higher continents. But to your question, what's important is that some bacteria died and fell to the ocean floor and this is where most of the early CO2 went, it formed layers on the ocean floor that over time became rock. Source: $URL$ When the first forests came, about 400 million years ago, they also played a role in trapping and storing CO2 and further reducing CO2 content in the atmosphere, but by then, much of the CO2 from 3 billion years earlier was already absorbed. Tectonic forces do return some of this trapped gas back into the atmosphere, but over time, (I think - the articles on this seem both a little mixed and often complicated), but I think the tendency is for a planet with life on it, to gradually trap more and more of it's atmosphere leading not only to a decreasing CO2 content but also a lower atmospheric pressure over geological periods of time. One possible example of this is the Pterodactyl, which, in order to fly, it probobly would need a thicker atmosphere than we have today. Insects also tell us a bit about past atmospheric pressure. Insects don't have lungs, so their size is limited by the available oxygen that flows into their bodies through tracheae. Bigger insects imply 2 things, higher oxygen content and/or higher atmospheric pressure. Now, more specifics and shorter term changes: ItsMyPostAndIllWriteIfIWn, is correct about oceanic storage of atmospheric gases being affected by temperature, but I have a hard time seeing that as playing a major role on a geological scale, though it certainly has an effect on CO2 content today. Major volcanic events, like the one 250 million years ago over Siberia or perhaps the one 66 million years ago over India might have burned sufficient coal and trapped carbon deposits to measurably change the atmosphere and CO2 content, but I think those changes were more temporary (though the one 250 million years ago was enormous, that might have made a significant longer lasting change). Also natural disasters like the oceans growing stagnant and releasing H2S - which is very bad for life on land, or the oceans releasing huge amounts of CH4 would also have short term effects on atmospheric content - so there's a whole lot of moving parts to this question, depending on how close you want to look at it. Footnote - I'm only a hobbyist, not a professor with a degree in this subject. It's a complicated field with a lot of moving parts. 

Basically, we know they were likely pelagic creatures because we find their fossils at essentially all water depths. If they were benthic creatures, we'd expect their fossils to be limited to a set range of paleo water depths. It's unlikely that a single benthic (i.e. living on the seabed) marine organism could live in both shallow water and ultra-deep water. However, for pelagic (i.e. floating or free-swimming) creatures, we'd expect to find their fossils at a huge range of paleo water depths because they live in the water column and don't care where the bottom is. 

Good question! I'll lay out the prevalent idea, originally (I think) put forward by Sykes, 1978 and supported by a large body of subsequent work by many authors. There are other models, however. In the most general sense: Intra-plate faulting is due to old, pre-existing weaknesses that are reactivated due to the plate interiors being very close to critically stressed. In other words, they're weak points in the interior of the plate. However, we don't fully understand why some old fault zones get reactivated while others in the same orientation don't. (It probably has a lot to do with pore pressure and fluid movement at depth.) There's a lot we don't completely understand about intra-plate earthquakes. Also, please don't use the term "fault line". It offends my geologic sensibilities! :) (Faults are 2D surfaces, not lines, thus the nitpicky objection.) Most of the crust is close to being critically stressed (breaking) There's a lot of evidence that the continental crust everywhere is close to being critically stressed -- in other words, failing in an earthquake. (e.g. see the various Townend and Zoback papers.) The crust isn't just critically stressed near the plate boundaries, but also away from them. This may also be true for oceanic crust, but we don't have as much data there. Another way of saying this is that the plates are being pushed along as hard as they can without crumpling. Basically, this is why things like building a dam or deep fluid injection trigger small earthquakes. The crust is already close to failure, so adding load or increasing pore pressure often triggers small fractures. (However, these sort of things can't trigger a major earthquake unless they're on an already active fault. You need continuous slip along a very large surface for a large earthquake.) The plates being critically stressed is actually is what we'd expect. We see deformation at plate boundaries whenever they collide. Therefore, we know that the stresses driving the plates are greater than the "breaking" strength of the crust. Because stresses from a collision at the boundary will be transmitted to the interior, it intuitively makes sense that the interiors should be close to, but just below (otherwise they'd be deforming), the failure threshold. (For the complete argument, see Zoback and Townend, 2001) Continental crust is full of old zones of weakness The continents are very old. Much older than the oceanic crust. The continents are like rafts that keep bumping into each other. Therefore, they have lots of "scars" (i.e. old fault zones). There's a saying in structural geology: "once a weakness, always a weakness". Fault zones are typically much weaker than the crust around them. Once a fault breaks through, it tends to be a permanent weakness that will be reactivated even if it's not in a perfectly favorable orientation. Critically stressed crust + weak zones --> intra-plate earthquakes. But why don't we see activity on all old fault zones? Short answer, we don't really know. It probably has a lot to do with pore pressure and fluid movement. Some old fault zones have intra-plate earthquakes, while others don't, even if they're in the same orientation. Pore pressure plays a huge role in faulting (it make rocks much easier to break). There's a lot of speculation that active intra-plate fault zones may have more fluids at depth, though explaining why is difficult. 

Yes. Earthquakes are Dangerous No. Because big earthquakes happen so infrequently (~300 years in Seattle's case) that one shouldn't really worry about it. Engineers design buildings to withstand large earthquakes. Of course there is the possibility of failure, but generally the US is very good about their infrastructure. Seattle is not like Oklahoma, where they are completely unprepared for earthquakes. I lived in Los Angeles in 18 years, and while my time there was during the Northridge 1994 earthquake, most of the damage was to the buildings (which were insured) and not to the people. Still there is some risk, but I think the risk of driving in Seattle is probably riskier than living in Seattle for 50 years of earthquakes. 

will give you a scatter plot with Lat being the x, Lon being the y, and rain being the z. Also note that because your vectors are different legnths, you cannot plot them. You must have vectors of the same lenght to plot (each point must correspond to another point on the axis). Other types of plots will require you to interpolate between the data points. If you want to plot it like in the comment below: pcolor is your best choice. Say your Lat/Lon vectors have n points. Then to make an nxn grid, you can use the command 

And your 2nd article This is at least partly semantics calling it "new" water. When we burn gasoline for example, the hydrocarbon structure becomes Water and CO2 - is that new water, or just re-arranging molecules by chemical reaction and fire? 

The cooling of the Earth should affect it's size, everything else being equal. How much, gets complicated, and there are other factors. Perhaps the cooling isn't even the biggest one. Looking at a density diagram, (source, Wikipedia) 

This is very confusing, because the paragraph mentions the temperature decline being interrupted, then, a little later, it calls that same period a "temperature depression". That's unclear to the point where I want to say it's a writing error. The "the La Garita Caldera eruption" part is fine, which ended the so called "temperature depression" and warmed the Earth up a little. Now, if you look at the line chart, between 33.9 and 28 (give or take), it was colder and then it was warmer before 33.9 and warmer (briefly) after 28, so technically, that is a depression, but it's still very poorly explained. Volcanic eruptions initially make the Earth colder due to ash blocking sunlight, but in the long run, very rare, super volcanic eruptions can cover parts of the Earth and glaciers with ash, darkening it and leading to less energy lost by reflection and leading to glacial melt. The blocked sun can kill plants as well, and if the volcano is large enough, it release significant amounts of CO2 as well, which, after the initial significant cooling (as the Ash in the air is quite temporary), very large volcanoes can trigger a longer lasting warming period due to increased CO2. It's reasonable and certainly possible that a sufficiently large volcano could do that, and that's what the paragraph seems to be implying. Finally the article mentions
