What did I mean by the weaker connection to the notion of a quotient object? We might look at sets as functions from a universe of objects to the set {0,1}. The functions can be defined in many different ways. Two functions are intensionally equal, if their definitions coincide. (Even if you define a function by a list of all the objects that it maps to 1, two such functions will only be intensionally equal if the objects are listed in the same order.) Two functions are extensionally equal, if their mapping behavior of objects from the universe is identical. Two intensionally equal functions are automatically also extensionally equal, but the converse is not always true. A set in this sense is a quotient object of extensionally equal functions. The existence of a well order makes it easy to work with quotient objects, because it enables us to pick a prefered representant from each quotient object. But at least in theory, it should also be possible to work with quotient objects directly. In that case however, one might have to worry about some intiutionistic distinctions. We might have a system of quotient objects, where we can always find out when two elements belong to different quotient objects (if we only search long enough), but where we sometimes can't prove that two objects really belong to the same quotient object. 

Universal algebra commonly doesn't use modal logic, so how does it work around this? How is this related to what I called "static and dynamic aspects of mathematical models"? One way to treat parameters is to add an additional constant symbol (0-ary function) to the non-logical language for each parameter. The drawback is that this modifies the system we want to investigate, but me might prefer to keep our model "static". We could add a sufficiently large numbers of constant symbols to our non-logical language, so that we always have a spare symbol when we need an additional parameter. So yes, in practice you can probably find workarounds to avoid modal logic, but it depends a bit on the questions you want to investigate whether this is a good idea or not. 

Also many technical details of the many world interpretation require physical answers (not philosophy). For example, Everett gave a justification of the Born rule in the context of the relative state formulation of quantum mechanics, which was later extended by Gleason and related to a mathematical theorem. To me as an outside observer, this sounds like: "If there is a probability measure on the many worlds, then it must follow Born's rule". It is the job of the physicists to work out those details and their conclusions. Another technical question would be which interpretations of quantum mechanics require a quantized version of general relativity, and which ones are compatible with an unmodified theory of general relativity. A question better suited for philosophy would be whether the many worlds of an interpretation must really exists, or whether their potential existence is enough. A fictional realism were they all exist might be the most convenient setting for doing actual physics, and an untrained investigator might be led into believing that one must accept their existence. But philosophers are well trained to know that very few things must really exist, and are more likely to spot the holes through which one can wiggle out of such a definite conclusion. 

(from the Catechism of the Catholic Church) Now, we must find a thought with a morally good object, end, and circumstance (which here means something that is a superset of typical usages for 'consequence'). Any such thought will suffice, because our definition of 'immoral' requires only that an action be "deemed improper by the modi operandi of a given society" and societies are quite capable of deeming anything improper. Most readers, I think, will agree at least one of the following suffices: 

Of course It's not so bleak, though. So, you and the people you are speaking with here seem to be defining 'faith in something' equivalently to the belief that there exists intrinsic value; that is, to have faith in something here seems to mean that one acknowledges the intrinsic value present in that thing. Deific adoration, then, presupposes faith, since it is necessary to acknowledge God's intrinsic value to worship Him. Moreover, though, faith 'in something else', if it is to be differentiated from the ordinary faith of expectation, is most reasonably understood as a holding of that 'something else' in the place of God (c.f. idolatry). Since to take something as God requires the attribution of the intrinsic value due God, this, too, seems to map well. Given that that is the definition we are dealing with, it should be no surprise that faith is necessary to avoid perceived meaninglessness; indeed faith is definitionally that which is necessary for meaningfulness! So, the statements made by these speakers are true, but vacuously so. They don't really reflect on the nature of Man's relationship to God nor Man's need for that relationship, and neither do they say anything which legitimately concerns mass shootings, depression, or the other Scary Social Things that they mention. They merely say "If you believe that anything has intrinsic value, then you don't believe that there is nothing of intrinsic value", and also "If you believe that there is nothing of intrinsic value, then you don't believe there is anything with intrinsic value", both of which are obviously true. The problem is that the speakers are trying to imply things that may or may not be true via other meanings and implications attached to the specific words employed. Essentially, those points which are argued by implication ('suicidal acts of violence are the result of not having enough faith', for example) are argued only via equivocation. 

There were some links to explanations of topics like 'logical positivism' in the original that are not preserved here, since they aren't strictly necessary. The linked youtube video is an excerpt from an interview with Mr. Hitchens where he talks broadly about how women should stay home and raise children and men should go get jobs. At one point he says "No. I'm not having any woman of mine go to work." The interviewer then says "You know you're going to get in trouble if you go down there" (Mr. Hitchens tries to say something over this about halfway through her talking, but I'm not sure what. Possibly "No, no they-- no, they-- I don't--". In any case, I think he's just trying to interrupt and the line I can't quite make out isn't critical). Mr. Hitchens then says "No, they don't need to work. They can if they like, but they don't have to". The interviewer then says "You are joking, aren't you?" to which he replies "No, I'm not. No, I would expect her to take care-- Well, you can work if you want, but you don't have to." 

Henkin semantics is important for higher order logic, but keep in mind that it is not automatically fully specified in every situation. Especially, are there any comprehension axioms at all, and if there are comprehension axioms, should they be predicative (i.e. avoid "inner" quantification over higher order variables) or impredicative (i.e. using arbitrary formulas including quantification over higher order variables as if they were first order variables). Also note that the comprehension axioms can have a sort of "last word" property, i.e. if you introduce additional non-logical symbols into the language, all additional comprehension axioms enabled by these additional symbols become immediately available. Worse still, consider that the context of the logic can be extended to include Henkin quantifiers, cardinality quantifiers (or "nasty" transfinite quantifiers) or forms of infinitary logic (since we must assume an underlying set theory anyway). But all this additional expressivity of the language is automatically available for the comprehension axioms too. (I'm not so sure about impredicative comprehension axioms here, since they might quickly lead to paradoxes in case the language is extended beyong pure first-order logic.) On the other hand, consider also the case where quantification over higher order variables is nearly absent, like in pure propositional logic where one just has a formula including propositions, and just want to know whether the formula is satisfiable (corresponding for existential quantification over all propositions), or whether the formula is a tautology (corresponding to universal quantification over all propositions). If we treat unquantified higher order variables in the same way, will standard semantics actually be different from Henkin semantics? 

However, I am not sure whether Asaf Karagila would agree that the way (carefully adapted versions of) Gödel's theorems are used as meta-theorems to prove strict containment in reverse mathematics qualifies as going beyond the axiomatic method. Even if I would elaborate it in more detail, it could still "feel like a lot of words without much meaning" to him. And maybe I would really be missing the point, by staying too close to Rota's implicit hints and simplified picture. The real point might be that Harvey Friedman (and some others) have not given up Hilbert's dream of finding a foundation of mathematics worthy of that name. Contrary to ZFC, a base theory like Friedman's elementary function arithmetic (and it second order version RCA*0) is not arbitrary: 

Quantum mechanics has to cope with worse side effects than that. How is it possible that light is both a wave and a particle? This seemingly contradictory state of affairs can be modeled mathematically by incorporating randomness into the model. I guess that modeling a quantized space will also require randomness in some form. Maybe the result of comparing the length of two objects is slightly random, if they differ only on the order of the Planck scale. Or we have some random lattice structure instead of a normal lattice. Perhaps there even exists (mathematically) "universal random lattice" structures, similar to the universal random graph? Can we define some Planck scale for such structures? The investigation of such structures might be interesting from a mathematical point of view, independent of whether these structures model any physical reality or not. 

I believe this to be a reasonable definition for this question's purposes as you give examples from a Judeo-Christian background, though it is possible, given your very unusual choices for the definitions of other terms, that this is an error in premise. 

In the 17th discussion of The Incoherence of the Philosophers, Al-Ghazali attempts to explain how a certain view of causality (which we can see is quite certainly intended to be that espoused by Avicenna) fails to meet his four requirements for an acceptable understanding of causality. However, both Avicenna and al-Ghazâlî seem, at least to me, to argue for different strengths of Occasionalism, and it is not at all clear that Avicenna's view fails to meet the four requirements put forth, at least to me. I don't really understand al-Ghazâlî's explanation as to why this view is rejected, can someone explain how the position is incompatible in a simpler manner? 

This comic by Corey Mohler does a good job of addressing this question. In short, because said people find a sort of short-sighted "New Atheism" convenient for maintaining the marginalization of women and other oppressed groups and preventing social change in general. While this position may seem quite harsh, it is well supported in the case of Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, as the lengthy explanation following the comic shows. Most of that explanation (the parts relevant to the discussion at hand) are reproduced below: 

Mu In short, asking about religion in the context of philosophy without defining your terms does not a good discussion make. 'Dogma' requires definition, for us to tell if atheism has that/is that or not. 'Religion' would probably benefit from definition, given that you ask "Is atheism supposed to be only anti-religious". 'Atheism' most certainly would benefit from definition. Depending on the definitions you propose, the answer can be quite different. In many cases, atheism has dogma, meaning that it is a perspective or system of belief (and, obviously, has foundational tenets in these cases). In other cases, atheism is a dogma prescribed as foundational for certain systems of belief/perspectives on the world. In other cases, atheism is neither a system of belief nor a belief and thus neither has nor can be dogma. In yet further cases, dogma isn't necessarily entailed by a system of belief, so atheism can be a special unicorn system with no dogma. In still other cases, things are defined unconventionally and anything can happen. 

In order for a thing to be potentially 'unethical' (here defined as a thing which ought to be done in a given circumstance), we only need to show that it ought to be done in even a single circumstance. That is, if we can show even a single example where thinking something contrary to societal norms (as we have thusly defined immoral) is good, given the context, then we have shown that thoughts can be potentially 'unethical'(again, remembering that this is here defined in a manner more akin to how 'ethical' is usually defined). We have not, for the purposes of this question, defined moral goodness, so for the purposes of this answer I will be using the following definition1:
