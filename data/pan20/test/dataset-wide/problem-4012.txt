Define a multi-particle "breeding" random walk $\mathcal{W_p}$ in $d$ dimensions, for $p \in (0,1)$ as follows: 

We can for the purposes of getting the expected number of changes in $n$ consecutive $Y$ values treat the problem as $n$ independent observations of $Y_k$ and $Y_{k+1}$. (Since the first observation can be a sign change relative to the $Y$ before the sequence, this is $n$ rather than $n-1$.) So the answer will be $n$ times the probability that a given $Y_k Y_{k+1}$ is negative. For that to happen at time $k==t+n$, consider the the random variate $Z = -\left(X_{t+2} + X_{t+3} + \ldots + X_{t+n}\right)$. In order for there to be a sign change from negative to positive in the $Y$ sequence at time $k$, we must have $$ X_{t+1} < Z \mbox{ and } X_{t+1} > Z $$ (The probability for a change from positive to negative is the same.) Z is distributed as a normal with mean zero and $\sigma = \sqrt{n-1}$. Then $$ P ( - \rightarrow +) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{dz}{\sqrt{2(n-1)\pi}}e^{-\frac{z^2}{2(n-1)}} \frac12\left[ 1+ \mbox{erf } \frac{z}{\sqrt{2}} \right] \frac12\left[\mbox{erfc } \frac{z}{\sqrt{2}} \right] $$ and the desired expected number of changes in the $n$ sequence is $$ 2n P ( - \rightarrow +) $$ This does not have a nice closed form, but for $n=20$ through $n=400$ is well approximated by $$S(n) \approx \frac29 \log^2 n $$ However, one can show that the expression is greater than $O(\log^2 n)$ for large $n$. As a nice aside, when $n=2$, one might naively expect the expected number of changes to be $1$. After all, in this case what we are calling $Z$ is just one of the $X$ variates, However, the correct answer is $\frac23$, and this reflects the fact that when that $x$ variate is far from zero, the expected number of sign changes drops off. 

Consider two variants on Self-(vertex-)Avoiding Random Walks on $\Bbb{Z}^2$: (A) "Legal" steps consist of any step not ending on a vertex previously visited, and the probabilities of each of the 1, 2, or 3 legal steps at any given time are equal. Since this SARW will a.s. become "trapped" and encounter a state with no legal moves at some time $\tau$, for our purposes we extend the definition of the walk to say that it remains at the trapped vertex for all $t \geq \tau$. (B) "Legal" steps consist of any step not ending on a vertex previously visited, such that there exists a path using only previously unused vertices that extends to a point more distant in each of $|x|$ and $|y|$ than the historically most distant point. This is always possible (since any state from which there are no legal moves must have been preceded by an earlier state with no legal moves). Again the probabilities of each of the 1, 2, or 3 legal steps at any given time are equal (although some moves that would have been legal for a type (A) SARW are now omitted from the set of legal steps). The type (B) SARW can never become trapped, and extension to indefinite time $\tau$ is natural. I am trying to study the behavior, for large integer time $t$, of the expected value of the (Euclidean-metric) distance squared from the origin $$ d(t) = E\left(x(t)^2+y(t)^2\right)$$ (For an ordinary 2-D random walk, which I label variety $0$. I believe it is well known that $d_0(t)=t$.) For the non-trapping type (B) SARW, one might intuitively expect that the "pressure" of not being able to easily return to the crowded region near the origin would force $$d_B(t) \geq d_0(t)=t$$ and indeed this is the case; in fact, the inequality is strict for $t \geq 4$. But the mildly surprising observation is that nonetheless $d_B(t)$ appears to be grow as $\Theta(t)$, and in fact it seems to be asymptotic to $Ct$ with $C=1$. So the questions about (B) are: 

It is difficult to account for the possibility of direct connections (forming chains of length $2$), and I therefore have no results for the problem as posed. For posets in which every chain is of length precisely, $3$, combining these factors, and summing over all tuples $(a,b,c)$ that add to $n$, we obtain $$ \mbox{posExact}(n;3) = \sum_{a=1}^{n-2} \,\,\,\sum_{b=1}^{n-1-a}\left[ \binom{n}{b}\binom{n-b}{a} \left( \sum_{j=0}^b (-1)^j \binom{b}{j} (2^{b-j}-1)^a \right) \\\left( \sum_{k=0}^b (-1)^k \binom{b}{k} (2^{b-k}-1)^{n-a-b} \right) \right] $$ The next observation is that for $n>37$, $$\log\left(\mbox{posExact}(n;3) \right) < n^2/5$$. Using the usual Stirling approximation tricks, one can show that for sufficiently large $n$, $$\frac{\log\left(\mbox{posExact}(n;3) \right)}{n^2}$$ is a decreasing function of $n$; in this case, "sufficiently large $n$ is $n>7$ (the peak is reached at $n=7$). Apparently, for all $n\geq 3$, $\log\left(\mbox{posExact}(n;3) \right) > n^2/6$ but I can't seem to prove that. (It is true at least up to $n=800$.) Numerically, for sufficiently large $n$, it appears that $$ e^{0.1719n^2} < \mbox{posExact}(n;3) < e^{0.1733n^2} $$ 

(a) The annihilating multiparticle walk, where the transition rule states that if two or more particles arrive at the same node at time $t$, all of them are removed from the state for time $t+1$. An annihilating multiparticle walk may reach a stopping position with zero particles, which we call "extinction." (b) The limited multiparticle walk, where the transition rule states that if two or more particles arrive at the same node at time $t$, all but one of them are removed from the state for time $t+1$. The state in this model could equally well be described as a finite subset of $\Bbb{Z}^d$, rather than specifying the number of particles and listing the nodes of each particle. (c) The exploding multiparticle walk, in which the second phase of the transition is trivial, and multiple particles can occupy the same node. Have these models been studied? Of particular interest are two questions: For a one-dimensional annihilating multiparticle walk, what is the probability of eventual extinction as a function of $p$? Define a "return to the origin" as a time $t$ at which there is at least one particle at the origin (it is allowed that other particles may be elsewhere at that time). For a three-dimensional exploding random walk, for what (if any) values of $p$ does $\mathcal{W_p}$ almost surely return to the origin? 

Obtaining an expression for $\mbox{pos}(n;3)$ is somewhat easier than obtaining the analagous expression for the number of isomorphism classes. In the case at hand, the number of non-identical uniform-height-$3$ posets is obtained by the following reasoning: Consider the "middle" set of numbers $\{b_m\}$ such that $\forall m :( (\exists a: a < b_m) \wedge (\exists c: b_m < c))$. In a graphical picture, there are three rows of numbers, with $<$ arrows connecting top row numbers to middle row numbers and middle row numbers to bottom row numbers; $\{b_m\}$ is the middle row, and we can label its count $b$. Let there be $a$ values of $x: x < b_m$ for some $m$, and $c$ values of $x: x < b_m < x$ for some $m$; so that $n=a+b+c$. Then to form a uniform-height-$3$ poset with row structure $(a,b,c)$ we must follow these rules: 

The property you mention does not always happen. $f(A)$ always reduces to the form $$ f(A) = \sum_k \frac{\alpha_k A^2+\beta_k A + \gamma_k}{\delta_k A^2 + \epsilon_k} $$ with $\{ \alpha_k,\beta_k,\gamma_k,\delta_k,\epsilon_k\}$ real-valued degree-4 expressions involving the components of $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{y}_k$. Moreover, all but $\beta_k$ are non-negative (hence are positive for generic $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{y}_k$). And by adjusting the components of the $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{y}_k$) we can make $\{ \alpha_k,\beta_k,\gamma_k,\delta_k,\epsilon_k\}$ take on any values we wish, subject to the non-negativity constraints and a limitation on $|\beta_k|$, whose magnitude is the geometric mean of the magnitudes of $\alpha_k$ and $\gamma_k$. Now choose $$ \begin{array}{cc} x_1^H = \left( 1, 1 \right) & y_1^H = \left( -1-\sqrt{3}i, 1 \right) \\ x_2^H = \left( 1, 4 \right) & y_1^H = \left( -1-\sqrt{3}i, 1 \right) \end{array} $$ Then (unless I have made some algebraic error) $$ f(A) = \frac{A^2-2 A + 4}{ A^2 + 1} + \frac{4 A^2 -8 A + 4}{ A^2 + 16} $$ which has a local maximum at $A\approx -11.88$, a local minimum at $A\approx -1.80$, a second local maximum at $A\approx -0.43$, and a second local minimum at $A\approx +1.85$. This one counterexample proves your assertion false, but the fact remains that for most randomly chosen sets of $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ vectors (for some suitable definition of random choosing, since there is are no restrictions mentioned on the magnitudes of $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{y}_k$ ) there will be only one local maximum and one local minimum. The reason is that the multiple dips come from unequal offsets of the drop-off due to the denominators; indeed if all the denominators were identical (that is, of all the $\mathbf{x}_k$ shared the same absolute values of their upper and lower components), there would not be more than one set of extrema. The rise and fall action of at least one of the individual rational fraction components is generally larger than the "interference" behavior induced by different denominators, so you have to fine tune the $\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\mathbf{y}_k$ get multiple dips. 

You can adapt the same approach as follows: Say $p_n(x)$ is an $n$-th degree polynomial matching $f(x)$ at all rational points, then in particular, $$ p_n(b_1) = 0\\ p_n(b_2) = (b_2-b_1)^2 \\ \vdots\\ p_n(b_k) = \sum_{i\in\Bbb Z+, i<k}\prod_{j\in\Bbb Z+, j\leq i} (b_k-b_i)^2 $$ For a given fixed sequencing of the rationals as $b_1, b_2, \cdots$, and for any given $k$, the latter expression is just some fixed rational number. So $p(n)$ is fixed by its values at $b_1 \ldots b_n$, and now consider $-f(b_{n+1}-p_n(b_{n+1}))$. Since all the terms past the $n+2$ term in $f(b_{n+1})$ are zero, $$f(b_{n+1}) = p_n(b_{n+1}) + \prod_{i\leq n}(b_{n+1}-b_i)^2 > p_n(b_{n+1})$$ which contradicts the statement that $f$ matches $p_n$ at all rationals. 

The key observation is that even if the sum of expectations of individual $X_n$ diverges, if correlations among the $\{X_{k_1}, X_{k_2}\ldots X_{k_m}\}$ with $k_m = \sup (k_i)$ do not fall off sufficiently fast as $k_m \to \infty$, then it is possible to "save" the convergence, that is, to have a finite probability of that the sum does not diverge. With that concern in mind, here is a sufficient condition (though I would not say this is anything like a necessary condition) that $\sum_1^\infty X_n$ diverges a.s., expressed in terms of the moments (including of course the correlation expectations): If for some $C \in \Bbb{R}, C > 0$ $$ \lim_{n\to \infty} n E(X_n) = C $$ and for all partitions of integers $k = \sum_{i=1}^m k_i$ with $k > 1$, and $ k_i \geq 0$ for all $i$, $$\lim_{n\to \infty} n^{k+1} \left[\prod_{i=1}^k E(X_i^{k_i})- E\left((\prod_{i=1}^k X_i^{k_i}\right)\right]=0 $$ then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty X_n$ diverges a.s.
