Let us prove even more general formula that Douglas Zare's one from the comments. Let $a_1>\dots>a_n$ be real numbers. Then $$ \sum_{\sigma\in\pi_{n}} \prod_{B_i\in\sigma}(-1)^{|B_i|-1}(|B_i|-1)!a_{\min B_i} =\prod_{i=1}^n(a_i-i+1). $$ (The required formula follows by setting $a_i=2(n+1)-i$ and shifting $n$ by $1$.) To see this, rewrite the right-hand side as $$ \prod_{i=1}^n\left(a_i-\sum_{1\leq j<i}u_{i,j}\right), $$ where $u_{i,j}=1$ for $j<i$, and expand all the brackets. We get the sum of the terms each having the form $$ (-1)^{n-|I|}\prod_{i\in I}a_i\prod_{i\notin I}u_{i,j(i)}, $$ where $I$ is a subset of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ containing $1$. To each such term, put into correspondence a partition into $|I|$ parts, where $a_i$ ($i\in I$) are the maximal elements of the parts, and each $u_{i,j}$ is interpreted as `$a_i$ and $a_j$ lie in the same set of partition'. This way, each partition $(B_i)$ will correspond to exactly $\prod_i (|B_i|-1)!$ terms, all having the sign we need. Thus, after substituting $u_{ij}=1$ we obtain the required formula. 

Clearly yes if $d\leq 2$. Clearly yes if $n\leq 3$, since the linear functionals $h_i$ are independent. Clearly no if $d>2$ and $n\geq 4$, as an example $x\geq 0$, $x+y\geq0$, $x+z\geq 0$, $y+z\geq 0$ shows (if $x$, $x+y$, and $x+z$ are integral then $y+z$ is integral as well). 

Thanks to Fedor Petrov for repeatedly pointing out my silly mistakes, and for suggestions how to improve the text (now I've rewritten the whole text). $\let\eps\varepsilon\def\tr{\mathop{\rm tr}}\def\pr{\mathop{\rm pr}\nolimits}$ Denote $U_m=\sum_{i=1}^m u_iu_i^T$ ($U_m$ is regarded as a nonnegative self-agjoint operator in the Euclidean space). Set $f_m(x)=\langle U_mx,x\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^m\langle u_mx,u_mx\rangle^2$. By $\tr f$ we always mean the trace of the self-adjoint operator corresponding to a quadratic form $f$. Notice that $\tr f_m=\sum_{i=1}^m\|u_i\|^2$ and, more generally, $\tr f\big|_V=\sum_{i=1}^m\|\pr_Vu_i\|^2$ for every subspace $V$. Let $\lambda_{1,m}\leq\dots\leq\lambda_{n,m}$ be the eigenvalues of $U_m$. Notice that $$ \lambda_{i,m}=\max_{V_{n-i+1}}\min_{0\neq x\in V_{n-i+1}}f_m(x)/\|x\|^2 =\min_{V_{i}}\max_{0\neq x\in V_{i}}f_m(x)/\|x\|^2, \qquad(*) $$ where $V_j$ is assumed to run over all $j$-dimensional subspaces. Since $f_m(x)$ does not decrease as $m$ grows, we have $\lambda_{i,m+1}\geq \lambda_{i,m}$ for all $m$. Moreover, $\lambda_{1,m}\geq c>0$ for sufficiently large $m$ (and some constant $c$), and we consider only much larger values of $m$. Finally, notice that for every $V_j$ we have $$ \lambda_{1,m}+\dots+\lambda_{j,m}\leq \tr f_m\big|_{V_j} \leq \lambda_{n-j+1,m}+\dots+\lambda_{n,m}. $$ Assume that the claim does not hold. We first show that $\lambda_{1,m}$ is bounded, and then show why it is impossible. 1. Assume that $\|U_m^{-1}u_m\|\geq \eps$ for some $m$. Set $v=U_m^{-1}u_m$, $w=U_{m-1}v$, $\alpha=\langle v,w\rangle=f_{m-1}(v)\geq \lambda_{1,m-1}\|v\|$ (so $\alpha$ is bounded away from $0$). Then $u_m=U_mv=w+\langle v,u_m\rangle u_m$ is collinear with $w$, $u_m=\beta w$. Now we have $\beta w=w+\beta^2\alpha w$, so $\alpha\beta^2-\beta+1=0$, $\beta=(1\pm\sqrt{1-4\alpha})/2\alpha$. This means that $\lambda_{1,m}\leq \alpha\leq 1/4$. So $\lambda_{1,m}\leq 1/4$ always. Moreover, $\beta$ is bounded away from $0$, as well as bounded from above (since $\alpha$ is not very small). Thus $f_m(v)=\langle v,w\rangle+\langle v,u_m\rangle^2=\alpha+(\beta\alpha)^2$ is also bounded by some constant $C_1$. 2. Let $e_1,\dots,e_n$ be the orthonormal base in which $U_m$ diagonalizes as $\mathop{\rm diag}(\lambda_{1,m},\dots,\lambda_{n,m})$. Consider the expansion of $v$ in this base. Since $\|v\|\geq \eps$ and $f_{m}(v)\leq C_1$, some eigenvector $e_i$ with eigenvalue $\lambda_{i,m}\leq 2C_1/\eps=:C$ appears in this expansion with a coefficient $\mu$ which is bounded away from $0$. Then $\langle e_i,u_m\rangle=\mu\lambda_{i,m}$ is also bounded away from $0$ by some $\delta>0$. Set $V_i$ to be the span of $e_1,\dots,e_i$. Then $$ \lambda_{1,m}+\dots+\lambda_{i,m} =\tr f_m\big|_{V_i}=\tr f_{m-1}\big|_{V_i}+\|\pr_{V_i}u_m\|^2 \geq \lambda_{1,m-1}+\dots+\lambda_{i,m-1}+\delta^2. $$ This means that there exists some $k$ such that $C\geq \lambda_{k,m}\geq \lambda_{k,m-1}+\delta^2/n$. But such event (a small eigenvalue increases by at least $\delta^2/n$) may happen only finitely many times --- a contradiction. 

$\let\eps\varepsilon$It seems that the following function fits: $$ f(A)=\inf\left\{\alpha\colon \quad \sum_{x\in A}x^{-\alpha}<\infty\right\}. $$ (I assume that $\mathbb N$ starts with 1.) Clearly, it is monotone, and $f(\mathbb N)=1$. Moreover, it is more than subadditive: we have $f(A\cup B)=\max\{f(A),f(B)\}$. This also implies that if $A_1\cup A_2\cup\dots\cup A_k=\mathbb N$, then $f(A_i)=1$ for some $i$. It remains to show that $f$ has the Darboux property. Let $f(A)=\alpha$ and $\beta\in[0,\alpha)$; we need to find $B\subseteq A$ with $f(B)=\beta$. We have $\sum_{x\in A}x^{-\beta}=\infty$. Set $X_n=[2^n,2^{n+1})\cap \mathbb N$, $A_n=A\cap X_n$, and $a_n=\sum_{x\in A_n}x^{-\beta}$. Then the series $\sum_n a_n$ diverges. Set $b_n=\min\{a_n,1\}$. The series $\sum_n b_n$ diverges as well (this is trivial if $b_i=1$ infinitely many times, as well as if it happens only finitely many times). Now, choose $B_n$ to be the subset of $A_n$ such that $S_n=\sum_{x\in B_n}x^{-\beta}\leq b_n$, and $S_n$ is maximal subject to this property. Then $S_n\geq b_n/2$ for all $n\geq 1$. Set $B=\cup_n B_n$; then $\sum_{x\in B}x^{-\beta}\geq \sum_n b_n/2=\infty$. On the other hand, for every $\eps>0$ we have $$ \sum_{x\in B}= \sum_n\sum_{x\in B_n}x^{-\beta-\eps} \leq \sum_n 2^{-\eps n}\sum_{x\in B_n}x^{-\beta} \leq \sum_n2^{-\eps n}<\infty. $$ Thus $f(B)=\beta$. 

We have $$ \sum_{x\in\{\pm1\}^n}x^TAx =2^{n-1}\sum_i\sum_{x_i\in\{\pm1\}}a_{ii}x_i^2 +2^{n-2}\cdot 2\sum_{i<j}\sum_{x_i,x_j\in\{\pm1\}}x_ix_ja_{ij} =2^n\operatorname{tr} A+0, $$ so one of the summands is at least $\operatorname{tr}A$. 

It seems that here is an example for rational exponents. Let $n=2209=47^2>3^7>2^{11}$, and $N=4\,385\,664=2^7\cdot 3^6\cdot 47=2048^{7/11}\cdot 2187^{6/7}\cdot 2209^{1/2}\cdot 1^{1/154}$ with $7/11+6/7+1/2+1/154=2$. If $N=ab$ with $a,b\leq 47^2$, then 47 divides one of $a$ and $b$ (say, $a=47k$); since $a,b\leq 47^2$ we have $47\geq k\geq 40$ (the right estimate is quite rough). But there is no product of powers of 2 and 3 in this interval. 

$\def\b{{\bf b}}$ No, not any lattice has such a basis. Notice that $||\b_n^\dagger||$ is the distance from $\b_n$ to the hyperplane $H_{n-1}=\langle \b_1,\dots,\b_{n-1}\rangle $; thus it is not greater than the minimal length of a lattice vector outside $H_{n-1}$. Moreover, they can be equal only in the case when this shortest vector is orthogonal to $H_{n-1}$. Now, take a lattice spanned by the equilateral triangle with unit side length in the plane. Then $||{\bf b}_1||\geq 1$, and $||{\bf b}_2^\dagger||\leq 1$; the equality in the second case is achieved only if $H_1$ is orthogonal to some unit lattice vector; but then $||{\bf b}_1||=\sqrt3$. So in any case $||{\bf b}_1^\dagger||>||{\bf b}_2^\dagger||$. More generally, we see that a lattice $\Lambda$ admits such a basis if it has some "layered" structure: the distance between two neighboring lattice hyperplanes parallel to $H_{n-1}$ is at least the smallest length of a lattice vector in $H_{n-1}$, and the same condition inductively holds for $\Lambda\cap H_{n-1}$. But even this condition seems to be quite weak. 

END_OF_CONSTRUCTION Now, an aperiodic Wang tiling with irrational maximal possible density of a disinguished tile provides an arrangement which we want to prove to be optimal. Let $\alpha$ be its density. Consider some optimal arrangement. We claim that it contains arbitrarily large squares which are organized as if they correspond to some lagre piece of a Wang tiling. Take any $ND\times ND$ square $Q$, where $D$ is large, and $Q$ has a density at least $\alpha$. Then, even if its clusters are arranged not that regularly, the restrictions we have yield that there exists a large subregion of $Q$ where they are arranged regularly, and the density is still large. This is what we needed (recall Koenig's lemma). 

I assume that $\bar X$ also contains $\varnothing$ as the Cartesian product of 0 copies of $X$. Set $Y=\bar X$. If $y_i=(x_{i,1},\dots,x_{i,k_i})\in X^{k_i}$ with $i=1,\dots,\ell$, set $$ g(y_1,\dots,y_\ell)=(x_{1,1},\dots,x_{1,k_1},x_{2,1},\dots,x_{2,k_2},\dots)\in X^{k_1+k_2+\dots}\subset Y $$ (so $g$ is simply the concatenation). Clearly, $g$ is reducible (with $F$ being a binary concatenation; we get a monoid, since we added $\varnothing$). Finally, for $y=(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ define $$ p(y)=f(x_1,\dots,x_k) $$ (we can define $p(\varnothing)$ arbitrarily; on the other elements, $p$ does all the job). Thus we obtain a reducible extension of $f$. So, each function $f$ indeed has a reducible extension. 

Yes, it is problem M618a), published in No. 4, 1980. Part b) claimed that for every $\alpha>0$ there exist infinitely many $n$ with $n^2+1\mid [\alpha n]!$. The problem is attributed to A. Sivatsky (who was a 10th grade student at that time). The solution is in No. 2, 1981. Also, this problem is discussed in an article by V. Senderov and A. Spivak in No. 4, 2002. If you need, I may find a cite to the electronic versions of all these. 

The answer is no. One may consider the function $u(x,y,z)=x$ on the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=1$. If $R(1,0,0)=(1,0,0)$ then your set is empty, otherwise it is an open hemisphere. One may replace $u=x$ by any strictly monotonous function in $x$. 

$\def\conv{\mathop{\mathrm{conv}}}$Recall that $\conv X$ is the set of all convex combinations of points from $X$. In a convex combination $$ f=\sum_{i=1}^k\alpha_ix_i, \qquad x_i\in X, \quad \alpha_i>0, \quad \sum_{i=1}^k\alpha_i=1, $$ for a point $f\in F$, all the points $x_i$ should lie in $F$ (and hence in $X\cap F$); indeed, if, say, $x_k\notin F$, then $f$ is a relatice interior point of the segment between $x_k$ and $$ \frac1{1-\alpha_k}\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\alpha_ix_i $$ which is impossible. Thus $f\in\conv(X\cap F)$. 

Consider any other graph $G'$ (obtained in the described manner) with $M(G')\cong M(G)$; if $S$ corresponds in $G'$ to $n-1$ edges sharing a vertex $v'$, then $G'\cong G$ (every edge not from $S$ connects the other vertices of the two edges from $S$ forming a circuit with it). Thus, the number of such graphs $G'$ is at most the number of sets $S'$ in $M(G)$ satisfying $(*)$. We are now to bound this number from above. Assume that $S'$ contains edges $e_1,\dots,e_k\in S$, and the other edges are not from $S$. Any $e\in S\setminus S'$ should be complemented in $S'$ to a 3-circuit --- by one of the $e_i$ and some other edge. One of the $e_i$ may be chosen in at most $k$ ways, the other one is then found uniquely, and these `other' edges are distinct for distinct $e$. Thus the number of sets $S'$ satisfying $(*)$ is at most $k^{n-k}=n^{O(n)}$, hence we get at least $f(n-1)/n^{O(n)}$ pairwise non-isomorphic cycle matroids. To summarize, $$ 2^{n\choose 2}\geq f(n)\geq c_n\geq \frac{f(n-1)}{n^{O(n)}}\geq \frac{2^{n\choose 2}}{n^{O(n)}}. $$ 

Due to homogeneity, we assume that $r_n=1$. Set $B=\{z\in \colon |z|\leq 1\}$ and $T=\{z\colon |z|=1\}$. Consider the function $$ f(z_1,z_2,\dots,z_n)=\frac {\displaystyle \prod_{1\leq i<j\leq n}(z_i-z_j)} {\displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^n z_i^{i-1}} $$ on the set $S=\{(z_1,\dots,z_n)\in B^n\colon 0<|z_1|\leq\dots\leq |z_n|\}$ (yes, this set is not closed). We claim that the maximum of $|f|$ is attained at a point with $|z_i|=1$ for all $i$ (that is, at a point in $T^n$); the required result will follow, since this reduces the problem to the case of equal radii. For any point $\mathbf z=(z_i)\in S$, set $\mu(\mathbf z)=\max\{m\leq n\colon |z_1|=|z_2|=\dots=|z_m|\}$. To prove our claim, we will show that any point $\mathbf z=(z_i)\in S\setminus T^n$ can be modified into a point $\mathbf w=(w_i)\in S$ such that $|f(\mathbf w)|\geq |f(\mathbf z)|$ and $\mu(\mathbf w)>\mu(\mathbf z)$. After a chain of such modifications, we will arrive at a point with $\mu(\mathbf w)=n$, which is what we need (by homogeneity again). So, assume that $\mu(\mathbf z)=m<n$. Set $t_i=z_i/z_1$ for all $i\leq m$ (then $|t_i|=1$), and consider the function $g(z)=f(zt_1,zt_2,\dots,zt_m,z_{m+1},\dots,z_n)$ (so $g(z_1)=f(\mathbf z)$). Notice that the whole power of $z$ in the denominator cancels out, so this function is a polynomial in $z$. Therefore, the maximum of absolute value of $g$ on $\{z\colon |z|\leq |z_{m+1}|\}$ is attained at some point $z_0$ with $|z_0|=|z_{m+1}|$, and we may set $\mathbf w=(z_0t_1,\dots,z_0t_m,z_{m+1},\dots,z_n)$. This finishes the proof. 

In a 1-factor decomposition of $K_{2n}$ which you describe (an edge from the center of a regular $(2n-1)$-gon to a vertex and all chords perpendicular to it), two matchings which correspond to `almost opposite' edges from the center form a Hamiltonian cycle. After you collect $n-1$ such pairs (by rotating one of them), one matchong remains. 

Here is an almost optimal explicit example. It is well known that the edges of $K_c$ can be colored properly in $c-1$ colors if $c$ is even, and in $c$ colors if $c$ is odd. Now, each edge of $K_c$ is a vertex of $G$; connect it by an edge in $G$ with all edges of $K_c$ of the same color. Then the degree of each vertex is just 1 less than the potentially maximal one. Just in case: how to color the edges. If $c$ is odd, regard the vertices as the vertices of a regular $c$-gon; the sides and diagonals parallel to each other form a color. If $c$ is even, regard the vertices as the vertices of a regular $(c-1)$-gon and its center; each color consists of one `radius' from the center, together with all sides and diagonals perpendicular to this radius. 

@Derek Holt is completely right: as $|G|\to \infty$, the fraction of subsets $(A,B)$ with $AB=G$ tends to $1$, so there is no such $c$. Indeed, assume that $|G|=n$. Let us choose the subsets $A$ and $B$ uniformly and independently. Fix any $g\in G$; there are $n$ pairs $(a,b)$ with $ab=g$, each pair belongs to $A\times B$ with probability $1/4$, and these events are independent for distinct pairs. Thus the probability that $g\notin AB$ is $(3/4)^n$, so the probability that $AB\neq G$ is at most $n(3/4)^n$ which tends to $0$ as $n\to\infty$. To conclude: if $n$ is large, almost all pairs $(A,B)\in P(G)\times P(G)$ satisfy $AB=BA=G$. 

I have already mentioned in a comment that the condition $N_w(k)=p_k$ cannot be satisfied for all $k$, otherwise we would have $p_{k+1}−p_k\leq 2(p_k−p_{k−1})$ which is not the case (should I explain the necessity of this condition?). Moreover, it should be at least true that there are infinitely many $k$ violating this inequality. On the other hand, the required growth rate is possible. Let us start with a general construction. Assume that $a_1,a_2,\dots$ is an increasing sequence such that the sequence $d_i=a_{i+1}-a_i$ is also strictly increasing. Let $w$ be the word where ones are placed exactly on the positions numbered by the $a_i$. Take any $n$; find the largest $k$ with $d_k<n-1$. Then each of the first $a_k$ subwords of length $n$ contains at least two ones and hence its position in $w$ is uniquely determined by the gap between these ones. All the next $n$-subwords contain at most one 1, and there are $n+1$ of them. Thus $N_w(n)=a_k+n+1$. Notice here that if the monotonicity arises only eventually, this changes $N_w(n)$ by at most a constant, thus it does not affect its grpwth rate. Now we need to specify this construction in order to get $N_w(n)\sim n\ln n$. Set $a_k=[e^{\sqrt{2k}}]$; Then the sequences $(a_k)$ and $(d_k)$ are eventually monotone, and $d_{k+1}/d_k\to 1$ as $k\to \infty$. Next, $$ d_k=a_{k+1}-a_k\sim e^{\sqrt{2k}}(e^{\sqrt{2(k+1)}-\sqrt{2k}}-1) \sim \frac{e^{\sqrt{2k}}}{\sqrt{2k}}\sim \frac{a_k}{\sqrt{2k}}. $$ Thus $$ N_w(d_k+2)=a_k+d_k+3\sim a_k\sim d_k\sqrt{2k}\sim d_k\ln d_k; $$ due to the monotonicity of $N_w$ and the fact that $d_{k+1}/d_k\to 1$, we obtain $N_w(n)\sim n\ln n$, as required. REMARKS. How to find this strange form of $a_k$? Setting $a_k=e^{f(k)}$, we obtain that we need $f(k)(e^{f(k+1)-f(k)}-1)\sim 1$. Replacing $f(k+1)-f(k)$ by $f'(k)$, we get $e^{f'}-1=1/f$, or $f'=\ln(1+1/f)\sim 1/f$. Thus $f(k)\sim \sqrt{2k}$. We have used the properties that $d_k$ increases, that $d_k=o(a_k)$ (in the last estimate), and that $d_{k+1}/d_k\to 1$. This shows the conditions within which this method works. 

A counterexample to the first question can be found along the same lines. Let $k>2$, $n=kM$; we will choose the value of $M$ later. Partition $[n]=I_1\sqcup\dots\sqcup I_M$, $|I_s|=k$. Let $B$ be the set of all points $x$ such that for each $s\leq M$, there exist two indices $i,j\in I_s$ such that $x_i=x_j=1$. Set $B_0=B\cap F_0$, $B_1=B\cap F_1$. Then $$ |B_0|-|B_1|=\left(\sum_{i=2}^{k}(-1)^i{k\choose i}\right)^M=(k-1)^M. $$ Now let us center the spheres at the points of $B_0$. Then each odd point which is not in $B_1$ will be covered at most $k-1$ times, hence the number of points covered at least $k$ times is (at most) $|B_1|=|B_0|-(k-1)^M$. Moreover, $$ |B_0|>|B|/2=(2^k-k-1)^M/2=2^{kM-1}\left(1-\frac{k-1}{2^k}\right)^M>2^{kM-2} $$ if, for instance, $M\approx \frac{2^k}{2(k-1)}$ and $n\approx 2^{k-1}$. Hence we have found a counterexample for the first question. Moreover, we have shown that in the second one, we should have $c\leq 1$. 

$\def\Hadw{\mathop{\rm Hadw}}$If it is not a mauvais ton, I would like to add an easier proof found independently by Sergey Dolgikh and Marat Abdrakhmanov (we used this fact as a contest problem). We assume that $G$ is finite and connected, and again we find all vertices in $H=\Hadw(G)$ corresponding to the vertices of $G$. Lemma. If $S$ is a vertex of $\Hadw(G)$ with $|S|>1$ and $v\in S$, then $\deg_H S<\deg_H \{v\}$. Proof. Every neighbor $T$ of $S$ in $H$ can be augmented by a path in $S$ to provide a neighbor $T'$ of $\{v\}$; all these neighbors are distinct since $T'\setminus S=T$. Moreover, $\{v\}$ has some neighbor contained in $S$. Now, for every $T\in V(H)\setminus\{V(G)\}$ we find its neighbor of maximal degree. By the lemma, this neighbor is a one-vertex set. On the other hand, for every $v\in V(G)$, the set $\{v\}$ is the unique maximal degree neighbor of any component of $G-\{v\}$. Thus we have reconstructed all sets of the form $\{v\}$. 

It is known that every polynomial having no positive root has a multiple with nonnegative coefficients only. So we may replace $\mathcal P$ by such multiple $\mathcal Q$ (surely, $f$ satisfies the corresponding equation as well). Now, since $\mathcal P$ has no real roots, the equality $f(x)=x$ is impossible; thus $f(x)-x$ has constant sign, say $f(x)>x$ for all $x\in\mathbb R$ (otherwise we may replace $f$ by $g(x)=-f(-x)$). Take any positive $x$; then $f^k(x)>0$ as well, so when we substitute this $x$ into our equation constructed for $\mathcal Q$ we get the sum of positive terms only. A contradiction. For completeness, let me sketch the proof of the fact used at the beginning. It suffices to prove it for polynomials of the forms $z+a$ (for positive $a$, it is trivial) and $z^2+az+b$ (having two non-real roots $z_0$ and $\overline z_0$). [SIMPLIFIED] For the second one, observe that for some positive integer $k$ the number $z_0^k$ has negative real part; then a polynomial $(z^k-z_0^k)(z^k-\overline z_0^k)$ is what we want.
