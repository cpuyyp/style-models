What if the language doesn't have the word for coffee, and there are several words to express it? For example, in Somali, coffee can be called both bun and qaxwe. 

The so-called "nature vs nurture" debate in linguistics is not as dichotomous as it may seem from the first sight. 

There is also an index of about 20,000 words, with information about the paradigms they belong to. Just for fun, I looked up the specific words you'd mentioned: belongs to the paradigm 507, is 518b, is 550a, is 139, is 565a, is 119. Oh my, only now did I realise how insane my mother tongue is. By the way, what you write about “feeling dead”/“feeling alive” can be regarded at best as a rule of thumb for foreign language learners. That's probably a useful approximation (perhaps even the best one that's possible to make), but it's really not the case that some objects “feel alive” in Polish. I'm a native speaker of Polish and have never heard of that rule or anything similar. Komputer and chleb don't feel alive to me in any sense, and they surely don't feel any more alive than samochód. I say samochodu, komputera and chleba simply because these are the forms I've learnt, and samochoda, komputeru, chlebu sound incorrect. In contrast to the above, the masculine/feminine/neuter distinction of the nouns does have some influence on how Polish native speakers perceive things. On the one hand, we know that it's just a formal distinction, so even though kot (‘cat’) is masculine (and needs to be used with the masculine forms of adjectives, etc.), it can refer to cats of either sex. When we want to be specific about the sex, we say either kocur (‘tomcat’) or kotka (‘female cat’). On the other hand, the gender of nouns does create some expectation about which sex is the default for a specific entity. For example, myszka (‘mouse’) can refer either to a male mouse or a female mouse, but since it's a feminine noun, it does feel slightly strange for Polish speakers that Myszka Miki (‘Mickey Mouse’) is a male. Last piece of advice: if you're interested in speaking Polish, as opposed to having theoretical knowledge about its grammar, forget about all I just said, find some Polish friends and talk a lot. I have a Norwegian friend who knows almost nothing about the Polish grammar, but speaks Polish fluently and gets maybe 80% of everything she says right. Theoretical knowledge about the grammar may perhaps be required to the cover the last 20%, but for the most part, you simply need to get the “feel” of the language and learn by experience. 

On the other hand, cz, ż, dż and sz are retroflex consonants, all articulated with the tip of the tongue pointed upwards or even bent back (hence the name): Note that English ch, s (as in "pleasure"), j and sh are similar to the sounds in question, but are palato-alveolar. It means that English ch is articulated somewhere in between Polish cz and Polish ć, and so on. If you are familiar with sounds of Serbo-Croatian, it may be helpful to note that Polish ć is basically the same as Croatian ć, and Polish cz is similar to Croatian č (I'm not quite sure if the latter is retroflex or palato-alveolar). Similarly, Polish dź is the same as Croatian đ, and Polish dż is similar to Croatian dž. It may be easier to tell sz from ś if you know some Russian: Polish sz is pronounced the same as ш in Russian "шут", and Polish ś is similar to сч in Russian "счастье" (but somewhat shorter). Finally, take a look at the transcription of these consonants in the International Phonetic Alphabet. It may be useful if you want to look them up in Wikipedia or find them in pronunciation charts to learn more about how they sound. 

The word doba is feminine, and we can see that it is accusative (jedną dobę) and not nominative (jedna doba). “*Byłem tam jedna doba” is clearly ungrammatical. So my updated conclusion is that, as far as I can tell, Polish doesn't have the bare NP temporal adverbials you're looking for. 

The languages with the most loanwords from English: There are several candidates, depending on how you define "loanword" (which is not quite clear in the case of creoles), "language" (as opposed to a dialect), and how you define "South-East Asia" (does Papua New Guinea belong to it?). In general, there are quite a few South East Asian countries where English is used a lot, but a good country to look for the language most influenced by English is Singapore. In most other countries, such as Malaysia and Philippines, the use of English is in decline. This is not the case in Singapore. 

According to the traditional definition, morphemes are by definition meaningful. Edit: Based on the disussion, I had to retract my statement about uncontroversiality. Yet, so far I haven't seen any non-circular definition of morpheme that doesn't relate it to meaning. As you noted, -ize can be used to differentiate meanings. This makes me think of Saussure, whose ideas have been very influential on modern linguistics. The cornerstone of his structural approach to language is the concept of value. To put it simply, linguistic signs (such as words or morphemes) don't exist in isolation and their values are determined by the oppositions to other signs in the language. From this perspective, if -ize can be used to differentiate meanings, then it's meaningful by definition. You may want to take a look at the chapters about morphology in Cognitive Grammar by John R. Taylor. The author analyses a few interesting edge cases of morphemes, such as n- in never and neither. He also argues why h- can't be a morpheme, even though there are semantically related words hear and ear. 

The question about the language with the fewest loanwords from English is much easier to answer. It is Sentinelese, spoken on the North Sentinel Island in the Great Andaman archipelago. It is the language of the few remaining uncontacted tribes, and therefore, even though nobody outside the island knows the language, we can be quite sure that the number of loanwords from English is 0. 

The only sensible interpretation I can see is that the action of "living here" will still be ongoing as of September, so its aspect is imperfective. But: 

In short, ć, ź, dź and ś are alveolo-palatal consonants, all articulated with the tongue raised towards the alveolar ridge (located just behind the upper teeth) and the palate (the roof of the mouth behind the alveolar ridge):
