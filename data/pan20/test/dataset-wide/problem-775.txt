I hope you see the pattern forming here. The closer the star or other object, the sooner it will appear to go dark, or disappear. Therefore, I would assume that because every humans eyes are basically the same, roundish, with a roughly 5mm pupil. The most distant object is probably right around 2.9 million light years away, the galaxy M33. Assuming that there will be no GRB within 30-60 seconds of all of the stars going dark, the sky would be completely dark to the unaided human eye in 2.9 million years. Not that humans will survive that long into the future, but that is a different problem all together. 

The two galaxies formed a great distance apart from one another, almost a billion years after the big bang. They are as close today as they have ever been. 

It really is that simple. Just set a variable to equal whatever starting MJD you want to be zero and count earth days between events. 

isn't as involved or difficult as it has been presented. If all you're looking for are image processing problems, then you're going to need to look into the following: 

Update: I find myself overwhelmed at work and unable to fully explain the entireties of the process at this time, please forgive me. However, I do offer a link to an upper division astronomy class' notes that gives a very good explanation of what I believe will help you with your question. 

If the ecliptic and the galactic plane were aligned, the two would line up on top of one another, as the Sun's and other planet's paths would be roughly the same path. There is still residual angular momentum within the solar system, which is how we arrived at our current orientation amongst the stars. 

So if you called ten days before the first event , then the "dates" of the first two events would simply be the following: 

For a more analytical and much much less philosophical version of an answer than MacUserT's, here it is. According to MacUserT, 

So, why the center of a black hole is called a "singularity"? Because all sorts of discontinuities and divisions by zero jump out of the equations, when you push math to the limit, trying to describe the very center of a black hole, within a GR frame. $URL$ Speaking in general, physicists don't like singularities. In most cases, this is an indication that the mathematical apparatus has broken down, and some other calculations are necessary at that point. Or it might indicate that new physics are taking place there, superseding the old physics. One last thing: just because we don't have a combined GR/QM theory to fully describe the center of black holes, that doesn't mean a pure GR research in this area is "wrong" or "useless". It doesn't mean one could imagine some arbitrary fantasy taking place inside a black hole. Astronomers these days are starting to observe cosmic objects that are very much like black holes, and their observed properties are in very close accord with what GR predicts for such things. So research in this field must continue, because it's clearly on the right track, at least in the ways we can verify today in astronomy. 

As for why they are not exactly circular, down to the last digit? There will always be perturbations that will squish perfect circles a little. Planets interact with each other, and pull each other off perfect circular orbits. It's very unlikely that in a complex system like ours you'll find highly circular planetary orbits. But, again, the differences between the current planetary orbits and perfect circles are for the most part quite tiny, and you should think of them as "basically circles", unless you're an astronomer or a NASA engineer. Comets, OTOH, those do tend to move on narrow elliptic orbits. 

That value for aberration of starlight is "horrible" in two ways: One, in that's is very small. And two, in that it's large enough to interfere with parallax measurements. In the late 1600s, scientists had already adopted the heliocentric model, and so were looking to measure the distance to the stars via parallax. Robert Hooke was among the first to attempt it, and probably the first to claim a measurement of the parallax. His observations were not very convincing at that time, but he probably did observe some effects from aberration of starlight (though they didn't know such a thing existed back then). In the early 1700s, Bradley attempted to make a more precise measurement of parallax, and did obtain significant data, but the variations in the star positions were out of phase with the model. Using the speed of light estimate by Ole Roemer from Hooke's time, he correctly proposed that this was not parallax, but a speed-of-light phenomenon, now known as the aberration of starlight. More info here: $URL$ It took another century, until early 1800, for Bessel to measure the first parallax. Basically, aberration of starlight produces the same variation in the positions of all stars, a periodic elliptic "wobble" that is the same for all stellar objects. Parallax produces a similar kind of wobble, but the amplitude depends on the distance to the star, and the phase is different from the aberration's. There are also other effects, such as nutation, which introduce further perturbations. $URL$ 

Barnard 68 is the first thing that comes to mind for me, it is a little over 10' across and is opaque in the visible spectrum. 

You're forgetting that one year is not 365 days, but 365.2422 or something close to that. That change will give you a number much much closer to the google provided number. 

Yes, it is absolutely possible. It would take a few years (more than 4) just to get our signal there though. I would imagine that a very high powered x-ray laser pulsed at a high frequency implying 0s and 1s, in a binary code would be the only real way to ensure that the same information leaving here would arrive there. The signal received would be in a larger wavelength, so that would have to be taken into account when deciphering the message. However, when the laser fired from JPL's observatory at the Galileo satellite when it was at Jupiter, the Galileo didn't have any trouble decoding the message. (see my profile pic) And that was only a (summed pulse) 40MW Nd:YAG laser (>_o), I'm sure that a space based laser system firing a similar strength laser (in the x-ray band) wouldn't have too too much trouble getting a message out there to Proxima B, if there were an array large enough to collimate the beam. My first order approximation puts the primary required to be something on the order of 60+ meters... which isn't feasible with today's technology. project paper 

I'm sure there could be something much larger out there, but like I said, this was the first to come to mind. 

As you mentioned, the Earth's rotational axis undergoes a slow precession. This results from tidal torques caused largely by the Sun and the Moon. There would be no precession if the axial tilt with respect to the orbital angular momentum vectors was zero or if the Earth was spherical. The Sun is almost spherical it's oblate to about $10^{-6}$, and is almost perfectly aligned with the ecliptic, it has a relatively slow rate of rotation, and all of the bodies that might cause a precession are far from the Sun, and because the gravitational gradient torque is an inverse cube relationship. All of these factors combined means the precession rate of the Sun is ridiculously small. So the short answer to your question is: 

EDIT: You can't have a very wide field, and simultaneously a very high resolving power, in an instrument with a large focal ratio (or any instrument, really), unless you use sensors with an unrealistic pixel count. Details below: The linear size of the focal plane is large - one document says it's the size of a "dinner plate". But the instrument is an f/24, which is a large focal ratio. At that ratio, a big linear size in the focal plane doesn't mean much in terms of angular size. From what I've seen, the Wide Field Camera has a total field of 4.7 arcmin, or 280 arcsec according to this document: $URL$ Anyway, yes, that's a small field, if you compare it with ground-based amateur astrographs, which can have a field as wide as several degrees of arc. But the Hubble telescope has a very high resolving power - 0.05 arcsec. Let's take your information and assume the WFC has a total field of 3 arcmin. 3 arcmin / 0.05 arcsec = 3600 pixels in theory, as a linear size of the WFC If you wanted the WFC to have a bigger total field, you'd have to either sacrifice resolving power, or use a sensor with an enormous pixel count, which is not feasible. The WFC uses several sensors, each one of them 800 x 800 pixels. 

Another option is a collapsible dobsonian. Not the pseudo-collapsible ones like the big SkyQuest series, but a true collapsible scope like the Sumerian dobs. A 16" dob built this way folds down into the volume of a regular travel suitcase. A 10" collapsible dob is like a small suitcase. These are built for the specific purpose of being taken on long trips away from home. $URL$ The 8" Alkaid Sumerian scope, at 800 mm focal length, is a pretty small dob already. The poles are probably pretty short. Should be easy to transport, and doesn't require much space when fully unfolded; you may actually have to place it on a stool or something. Obsession Telescopes also makes dobsonians of all kinds. Their Classic series are bulky when packed, but the Ultra Compact series is basically a true collapsible dob which might be worth considering: $URL$ You don't need a table for these scopes, since they are sitting on the floor. Table wobbliness issues are eliminated. :) There are equatorial platforms made for all these scopes, so you could even use them for photography. I do not own Sumerian or Obsession telescopes, but the feedback I hear through the grapevine is good. These are quality instruments that could be used as a general-purpose telescope even at home. 

Well without your big brother jupiter looking out for poor little earth then life on earth wouldn't be possible (most likely, but definitely not intelligent life as it has taken us millions of years to evolve to this point, and meteor collisions would increase at an alarming rate). You receive a force on your body from all the planets in the solar system and everything in the universe for that matter, but they are neglible compared to the force you feel from earth. "But Jupiter is so much bigger than earth how could its gravity be negligible?" Well the intensity of gravity is proportional to 1/distance^2 (one over distance squared) so the farther you are away from something the less gravitational effect it has on you, and earth is big enough that it is most likely the only gravitational effect your body will ever truly be aware of. However you can see the tidal effects caused by the moon. High tide low tide are created by the moon's gravity. I once heard a man say astrology (the arch nemesis of the astronomer) is based in the tidal affects on the heavy metals in one's body caused by the positioning of the planets at one's birth, which I had to admit made for a pretty convincing argument though I still don't read my horoscope. 

the light from the big bang is in your living room... because that is where the big bang took place... did you know you were so special? Just kidding, but maybe I misunderstood your question. I think what you are asking is, well if you look into deep space you are looking back in time since it takes light X amount of years to travel to the observer. So look far enough back and you would see the big bang right? We already thought of it, and the problem is you can't see the moment of the big bang, because there were no such thing as photon's at that moment. It took about 400,000 years (an afternoon nap on the scale of the universe) for the intensity of the moment of creation to simmer down enough atoms could form removing the opacity of the universe freeing photons to begin their cosmic journeys.. If you were to look out that far you would just see a big opaque blob like trying to look into the center of the sun. The light from that moment still exists and you do see it... you just don't SEE it. The spectrum of the sun's light that has the highest intensity is in the visible light wavelength. One would imagine that all species of the universe see in the same wavelength and thus we would all agree on what visible light is. This is not true. We see in the visible wavelengths because of evolution. Our eyes adapted to the highest intensity light available. Think about natural selection. Ancient primates who could see better would be better hunters. So those who were utilizing the highest intensity light the best would be ideal mating candidates giving birth to more off spring with eyes like there own (a little theory of mine). If you grew up on a planet with a sun that gave off a lot of infrared light you would see in infrared. Anyway, what I am getting at is if we somehow managed to evolve to this point on a rock with no companion star (an impossibility for all intents and purposes) in some dark corner of the universe where there was no other really intense light around, theoretically eyes would have evolved to see in the cosmic microwave background because it would be the only light available. CMB radiation (the afterglow of the big bang) is ubiquitous. It is everywhere at once. It gets cooler as time goes on as space time stretches, stretching the wave length of the light making it harder and harder to detect. I hope that answered your question. 

This is more of a question for the Physics stack, but I'll give it a shot, since it's fairly basic. You need to understand something before we begin. The theoretical framework we have to gauge and answer this sort of thing is called General Relativity, which was proposed by Einstein in 1915. It describes things such as gravity, black holes, or just about any phenomena where large densities of mass or energy are involved. There's another chapter in Physics called Quantum Mechanics. This describes, usually, what happens at very small scales - things that are super-tiny. Both GR and QM are fine in their own way. Both are tested against reality and work very well. But they are not compatible with each other. Meaning: you cannot describe a phenomenon from a GR and a QM perspective, both at once. Or meaning: we don't have a coherent set of equations that we could write down, and then "extract" out of them either a GR-like view of reality, or a QM-like view. The problem is, the center of a black hole is both very high mass density and very high gravity (and therefore right in the field of GR), and very small (and therefore "quantum-like"). To properly deal with it, we'd have to reconcile GR and QM and work with both at once. This is not possible with current physics. We pretty much have to stick to GR only for now, when talking about black holes. This basically means that anything we say about the center of a black hole is probably incomplete, and subject to further revision. 

This is far too soon to draw sweeping conclusions. The Philae probe has only measured deuterium for one comet. But comets are diverse, of diverse origins. We need to take a lot more samples, from many different comets, before we can conclude firmly that water has, or has not, come from comets. The only conclusion we could draw so far from this study is that earthly water has not come exclusively from comets similar to 67P/C-G. What you're seeing now is the usual distortion that occurs in the media after some hugely popular experiment is completed - its conclusions are blown out of proportion. But that's not how science works. Let's write this one down, and wait for further science to be put forth. We don't know enough yet about these objects.
