Clauses are usually made up of finite verbs in predicates and additional dependent information. "John wants to read" and "John wants a book" are more-less equivalent. Non-finite verbs, such as "to read" (a full infinitive) are usually parts of a verb chain/verb catena. The difference between those two is just that there is a noun in the second sentence and a non-finite verb in the first. Both are mono-clausal. You might've gotten the bi-clausal bit of data from some book; it is probably mistaken (at least as far as I know). It might have a different definition of clause. 

In all three of these languages, the bolded word is an inflected adverb (originally fast/schnell/brzo). I'm not sure about other languages, but these three do definitely have it. 

If you're doing it by touching your teeth, you're more likely pronouncing (if I'm reading correctly) either /tθ/ (voiceless dental affricate) or /t̪ɕ/ (voiceless denti-alveopalatal affricate). A voiceless postalveolar affricate would rather be /tʃ/. I'm not actually sure of the exact sound you're making as I can't hear you, but this is my best guess. 

Even though this was answered a long time ago, I feel there is a need for clarification. As Sverre mentioned, -nnr- becomes -ðr- in Old Norse per regular rule, but this is often avoided: words like Proto-Germanic *­hanþaz (clever, sharp, "quick") gave Old Norse hannr, then *­swinþaz (strong) giving svinnr, as well as *­minniz (small in quantity) giving minnr. This isn't that frequent, with not a lot of words featuring no alternative form that has -ðr-. It's also noteworthy that many Norse words can take either the -ðr- or -nnr- form and in many cases they can even alternate without any visible pattern. Icelandic and Faroese usually have words that reflect the -nnr- variety but -ðr- can also sometimes pop up here and there, and, even in some cases, such as with "annar" in both languages, we can see a complex (yet in this case regular) alternation between the two forms. 

He further lists the North Germanic synonym as deriving from *burjaną, which is definitely not its cognate. Furthermore, byrjȧ is attested in Old Norse, and byrja is its descendant in Icelandic, Faroese and western Norwegian, all meaning "begin". The verb begynne is a loan from Low German into the continental Scandinavian languages. Furthermore, Wiktionary lists the Old English verb as beġinnan, obviously showing a palatal /j/. I am not sure what the source of the Wiktionary entry is, but this is a possible sign that analogy had taken place — since it, as a strong verb, must have had a /g/ in the preterite. The spelling begynnan/ongynnan is unetymological, and would probably not represent an original i-umlauted PGmc. /u/ vowel (since the verb is strong, it cannot be anything like **begunnijaną, though such a weak verb would indeed be well-formed); if anything, it would represent a rare-ish u-umlaut of an /i/, or (far more likely) a hypercorrection or scribal error. There is nothing contradictory in that it now has /g/; it never inherited the /g/ into early Old English in the first place, but generalised it out of a paradigm that showed a /g~j/ alternation. 

Semantically loaded, the things you request translated. Ah well, such is life. Based on my non-native knowledge of Icelandic, I'd translate both as: "Ég hef ekki heimili en er ég með veginn" (with the part you need highlighted). As for Mongolian, wait for some other answer I guess. 

This is, in essence, untenable — we know that there was a time before human language, and as such no word can truly be traced back to an infinite tree of descent. Now, more realistically what you're asking: no, words can be coined all the time. If your coinage merely looks like a word, but has no inferrable meaning (such as 'stralts' in English), it is highly unlikely it will catch on. Words do exist outside of dictionaries — but to get into them, they have to exist and be in use. 

is probably the one you're looking for. As far as I know, it's two separate sounds in German, so and are out of the question. is also out of the question because it would either be trisyllabic or have a non-syllabic schwa. 

Yes, even when you have a perfect one-to-one correspondence between the phonemes and (allo)phones used: even when the language has literally no phonetic variation/allophony, [ɡeɡe] will always be the phonetic/surface equivalent of /ɡeɡe/. This is a strictly theoretical approach, clearly. Addendum: there are even deeper levels of analysis: archiphonemes and morphophonemes are sometimes mentioned in such contexts, and they tend to (in the roughest possible of terms) act in a manner analogous to how phonemes relate to phones. 

The IE-to-Uralic loanword transfer phenomenon is quite messy. There are those basic vocabulary terms that look alike, but it goes beyond that sometimes. The conjecture that the borrowings are borrowings is moderately well accepted, though people have been pointing out the exact same problems you just did: they are so fundamentally basic it's almost silly. Besides "give", "do", "woman", "person", there's also "wet/water" (PIE * wed- and * woder- corresponding to PU * weti), "fish" (PIE * (s)kʷálo- (whence whale, squalus) corresponding to PU * kala), "to stab, push" (PIE * neiǵʰ- corresponding to PU * nikka) et cetera. Sure, these range from really basic to somewhat peripheral, but there are some words that look very related but are extremely unlikely to be borrowed, such as the first (PIE * me, * méne (acc. and gen.) and PU * mun, * minä (just nom.)) and second person pronouns (PIE * tū́ and PU * te, tun, * tinä/cinä(?)), the demonstrative pronouns (PIE * so-, * to- and PU * sä, * tä, * to), a couple of case endings (PIE * -m, * -od (accusative and ablative) and PU * -m, * -ta/tä (same cases)), as well as some conjecture relating to some other endings that might look related (PIE 1SG/PL and 2SG/PL endings * -m, * -me, * -s/tHa (active and perfect forms), * -te, corresponding to PU * -m, * -me, * -t and * -te) It really looks like you'd have to strain to say all those were borrowed, though I admit that may be my opinion. Here in Europe, there's some small to moderate mainstream support for this Proto-Indo-Uralic thing: mainstream linguists such as Frederik Kortlandt and Robert Beekes say that it is possible that the two language families are related. Now, I cannot answer your second question as it's not something I'm familiar with, but regarding the third one, I can say that it is extremely uncommon for basic vocabulary to be borrowed, core morphology even more so. There are a plethora of Indo-European borrowings in Uralic that entered the language(s) at various points in time, sure, but borrowings and loanwords can also stand side-by-side with cognates. (I think I'm going off on a tangent now, so I'll stop here; I hope the answer was good enough).
