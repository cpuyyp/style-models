Only if by "natural" you mean not (yet) found in the world without human action(s) - but why would you use the term nature to exclude humanity: a sub-specie to apes? It seems a false dichotomy to oppose "natural" and "synthetic" (or "artificial"). Considering the history of the term synthetic - is there anything in nature that cannot be put together with something else? Consider the term "organic" - in one sentimental sense it means "natural" according to "organisms" and yet scientifically it just means having carbon, like the hydrocarbons in gasoline. 

An argumentum ad lapidem would be a fallacious dismissal if you were to query the dismissal and receive nothing to support it. This is similar to the fallacy of "proof by assertion" in that the assertion that your suggestion has a time and place which is not now is an unsupported assertion. Also related to "begging the question" depending on how the dismissal statement might be constructed propositionally. 

If you want to remain skeptical of the world and your observations of it, there is nothing which will convince you otherwise, however, I suggest at the very least you distinguish intuition from projection. Also consider distinguishing illuminating appeals to skepticism from unilluminating appeals to skepticism(those which lead to knowledge or the means to obtain further knowledge, and those which induce a resigned ignorance). As for your questions, consider that "we" don't do "cognition" the individual does. Consider that certainty and confidence are only a mood. Consider that you did not invent the language you use. Consider as you read this that you did not write it. Of course observation and knowledge of the world is imperfect, incomplete and down right degenerate, however, in spite of this we build bridges, skyscrapers, send men to the moon and back and replace human hearts with imperfect, non-absolute knowledge of the world (what is, the case, states of affairs). You could read DesCartes Meditations and rest assured that everything can be doubted except that you are thinking - even when you imagine thinking to be the passing from one imponderable analogy to the next. You could read Searle's "Intentionality" and ponder how consciousness is directed at things in the world. If you are tempted to solipsism, consider that first person subjective solipsism is irrefutable in the same way a child can say "no" to everything; consider as well that 2nd person subjective solipsism is immediately refuted by any other first-person subjectivity. Can we trust each others cognition? Yes. Again: we have the language we use which we did not invent to remind us every time we try and communicate with anyone else. 

"Some" just means a sub-set with at least one member. If "all dogs" are thought of visually (like a Venn diagram) as a circle, then "some dogs that are carnivorous" would be a smaller circle inside the "all dogs" circle. Likewise, "some dogs that are vegetarian" would also be a smaller circle inside the "all dogs" circle. Do the two smaller circles inside the "all dogs" circle overlap? Well, if we take carnivorous to mean "eats meat" and vegetarian to mean "eats vegetables" in an exclusive sense of "eats only meat" and "eats only vegetables" then they do not overlap. If we take carnivorous and vegetarian to describe the predominant diet, then they could overlap at different times of at least one dogs life, but this is stretching things a bit far to make a contradiction plausible. Also, where they might overlap, would we not say the dog is omnivorous? As for whether or not each premise is true, there is significant evidence supporting the claim that some dogs are indeed carnivorous. While dogs are generally considered to be omnivorous, I don't think there are many considered vegetarian, tho it is certainly arguable that there is at least one instance of a vegetarian dog somewhere. So, if we take premise one to be true and premise two to be true, are we correct in deducing that there is a dog that is both vegetarian and carnivorous? In the exclusive sense of "only eats meat" or "only eats vegetables" this is obviously a contradiction, so no, the two smaller circles do not overlap. In the loose sense of "predominant diet" then the truth value is still relative to the time of evaluation and predominance implies that one diet or the other is the main source of nutrition, so, again, no: there are no dogs that are both carnivorous and vegetarian. Of note, exclusively vegetarian diets are not at all a good idea for your doggy. Please talk to a licensed veterinarian for nutritional guidelines and breed risk assessment if you are feeding your dog like so. As for logic, if you dig this kind of stuff, check out Logic-Cola by Harry Gensler - it is a fun companion to his book, Introduction to Logic. Let's look at your initial premises: Premise 1) Some X are A (i.e. at least one X is A) Premise 2) Some X are B (i.e. at least one X is B) Here I think you might want an additional step, stating the relationship of A and B. Premise 3) All A are not B (i.e. No A is B) Therefore your Conclusion) Some X are A and B (i.e. at least one X is A and B) is false because it contradicts the third premise. 

No. The answer is different if you mean an inclusive disjunction or an exclusive disjunction. In both cases they are false when both operands are false, but the exclusive disjunction is also false when both operands are true. (See the truth table below) 

An absence of lies may be sufficient for truth, but does not necessarily mean that a rational assessment of "non-lying" statements will be true. The question is a bit like comparing horses and buggies. Truth is a condition of propositions (statements, sentences, etc.) which is satisfied when utterance corresponds to (matches, fits...) what is the case. The absence of truth can be falsehood, or the absence of truth can be a statement which is not rationally assessed a truth value, such as an opinion or an order. A lie is an intentionally false or intentionally misleading statement. The conditions of satisfaction requisite for a lie to be identified are different (intentionalistic, agentive). Now if someone intentionally misleads with true statements, the absence of the lie is not truth. Imagine you work in an office with no windows. The weather forecast called for possible rain and you are wondering if you should bring your umbrella with you when you go to lunch. A coworker who has a corner office with windows happens by your office door and you ask them to tell you what the weather is like outside. Unbeknownst to you your coworker suffers a delusional mental disorder such that when in fact the sun is shining, they think it is raining. Furthermore, your coworker decides to play a trick on you and tell you that the weather is other than it appears to them. When they return to your office and tell you the truth that it is sunny, did they lie? 

Now, that the premises may be true, share a term and the conclusion true, but, if the conclusion is not drawn from the premises, then the argument is unsound: 

the moon is roughly 239,000 miles from the Earth. the moon is more than a mile away from the Earth. the moon is closer to the Earth than the Sun. 

Rand's "fatal flaw" is that she merely presents a way of looking at things - no different than a poem - to be either agreed or disagreed with depending upon the readers mood. Objectivism is "the world according to Rand", not "the world". Juxtapose a protagonist of hers and of Kafka's and then ask yourself, how can the world be both? The answer is that it is neither. A theory, on the other hand, states the ponderable conditions by which it is falsified or verified. Compare her tackling of Hume's Guillotine with a counter-example to it. 

An agnostic, ignostic or theological non-cognitivist position is refuted if provided meaningful definition of deity and empirical verification (read: knowledge) of an ontologically positive claim regarding deity and a proponent would then then, given the standard model of rationality, have grounds to defend a gnostic position. Belief does not depend upon empirical verification, however, and what constitutes a convincing argument (i.e. proof) is relative to the non-believer's background and network of beliefs. 

Is deity necessarily just? In one sense, justice is fairness, another it is simply the administration of law. If the deity you speak of makes the laws, then everything they do is just. If the deity you speak of is the arbiter of what is fair or not, then everything they do may very well be fair even if you disagree. 

Philosophy translates from the Greek through the Latin to love of wisdom. This simple etymological fact has remained unchanged for nearly 3,000 years. A good starting place is to have a clear understanding of what philosophy (read: love of wisdom) means. In the context of the initial utterance, philosophy distinguished itself from sophistry, or, the professional dispensation of advice or wise counsel (a contemporary sophist in the non-pejorative sense would be a lawyer or doctor, or, pejoratively, a con artist, a palm reader, a snake oil salesperson). The value of this counsel was often relative to the price paid for it or to the status of the person paying for such counsel. By contrast to sophistry, love of wisdom, however, is no mere amateur pursuit. In the context of initial utterance, love was akin to virtue, respect or reverence, and, had nothing to do with modern notions of romantic passion except that you could say philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom. In the sense of the initial Greek meaning, that which philo- is respect for, reverence or virtue of, however, is the point: wisdom. Some consider wisdom the intelligent application of knowledge, but ask yourself, intelligent according to whom? Donald Trump? Alex Trebek? Noam Chomsky? Mamma June? No, wisdom requires knowledge, not opinion, sentiment, or personal points of view (if you say otherwise, you need only show how). Wisdom, all wisdom, simply obtains knowledge. In this sense, philosophy is the respect for obtaining knowledge. 

"The concept of world-view, which was first encountered among the Greek sceptics, is substantially broader in meaning than the concept of philosophy, moreover it has several different meanings."* The world is neither happy nor sad. The world just is. A worldview* that the world is happy is just that: a view of the world you fit the world to. If, however, your outlook were enough to determine how the world is, then a mirage and an oasis would have epistemic and ontological equivalence. They do not. As for your title, optimism is a mood. One can be an optimist at breakfast, an existentialist for tea, a nihilist at lunch, a pessimist over drinks and a hedonist at dinner with equal epistemic value: none. Optimism can dispose you to being deluded, but optimism is not necessarily delusion. 

The etymology of the term should suffice. "Metaphysics" is not a term which either Plato or Aristotle used. It originated with Andronicus of Rhodes (~150CE). Lacking a significantly coherent statement in the beginning of the writings to work with, as would have been customary for a title in his day, Rhodes' organizing principle for the extant works of Aristotle (essentially categorizing a hodgepodge into a collection) was simply that they were placed on the shelf after the books on physics: ta meta ta physika biblia, i.e. "the books that come after the books on physics." Only later was this categorical placeholder naming considered taxonomic and thus began a pernicious history of metaphysicians soliciting agreement with weltanschauung and proferring the hermeneutical as if it were heuristic - all under the banner and misnomer of "philosophy". See also: The Origin of "Metaphysics" by Anton-Hermann Chroust The Review of Metaphysics Vol. 14, No. 4 (Jun., 1961), pp. 601-616 To be clear, philosophy - and this for 2500+ years - translates to "love of wisdom". "Love" in the context of initial utterance was akin to "respect", "virtue" or "reverence" - nothing to do with notions of romantic love common today. To the point, however, philosophy distinguished itself from sophistry and the professional counsel of wise people (think of lawyers, financial managers, doctors and such today) whose "wisdom" was often dispensed relative to the monetary or political circumstance available with its authority. What then is wisdom apart from those deemed wise enough to dispense it? Some have said wisdom is the intelligent application of knowledge. This may be so, however, intelligent according to whom - and who would be the arbiter? No, wisdom simply obtains knowledge. And that is all. Philosophy is the virtue of obtaining knowledge; philosophy is respect and reverence for obtaining knowledge. What then is knowledge? Knowledge is empirical verification of what is (else how do you "know" what is?) of which there are three kinds: 1) axiomatic, or self-evident knowledge, e.g. "2+2=4" or "all dividends require financing" 2) empirical knowledge, e.g. "brute" facts (pace Anscombe) such as "the Earth is ~93 million miles from the Sun" or "institutional" facts such as "Obama is President" 3) self-knowledge, e.g. "I feel glad" At first glance, it might seem circular or redundant to consider "empirical knowledge" as "empirical(ly) empirical verification of what is" but I can only ask that you consider that it is just really, really basic. Think about it, eh? Is there any good reason to presume otherwise, much less entertain non-illuminating skepticism regarding the senses? It might wreak havoc with the outliers that we are all deceived by an "evil demon" but we did not build the internet by wondering if we are merely batteries for the matrix... So, ask yourself: do you "know" that Obama is President if you have not empirically verified the statement corresponding to what is the case in the world? Do you "know" that you feel fine if you have not empirically verified yourself feeling fine? Do you "know" 2+2=4 if you have not observed the calculation of, having done the calculation, what is a self-evidenced truth that 4=2+2 is 2+2=4? If you must, you can consider that which is observationally verifiable when it is verified by observation to be empirical knowledge: in short the world is that which is empirically verifiable (read: known). 

Keep in mind that Searle's "Chinese Room Argument" is a refutation of the computational theory of mind and not a refutation of the possibility of machine learning or non-biological consciousness (as it is often mis-read that way). Nor is Searle's theory positing that the computer is not a useful metaphor for consciousness or tool for examining consciousness - both, however, have their limits. What Searle is doing with the Chinese Room argument is showing the limits of syntactical manipulation to achieve semantic content. His aim in doing so is to explain and one day demonstrate how to get from "the physics" to "the semantics."

According to this article on his theory of ideas, it seems there is no "objective" in the contemporary or empirically verifiable sense of the term, and DesCartes objects are presentations made to the individual mind - like subjective "sense data" for lack of a better term: 

...can both be answered by, "because I am cold." In the former case, physical cause is cited, in the latter, logic. Towards answer #3, consider that the question is imponderable and otherwise: know thyself. 

It depends somewhat upon the scope of your descriptions. Yes, in a poetic sense, "There is nothing new under the Sun" and anything is just a different combination of particles which have been around since the beginning of spacetime, however, there is much to be said for novelty. Consider that for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office all a patent application requires is "a novel application of an idea." 

Is his prayer for "sale increase" also a prayer for "his neighbors sales decrease"? I.e. does this prayer explicitly request an injustice? Couldn't the praying shop owner pray for better business without harming his neighbors? Couldn't a just deity answer an individual prayer for betterment without the detriment of others? Would a just deity honor a prayer for injustice? If the praying shop owner prayed "dear God, please make my business so successful it drives my neighbor out of business" would a just deity drive the neighbor out of business, or, use this prayer as an opportunity to help the praying shop owner see the humanity in his neighbor's business? Also, if there were only one customer in the world and that customer could only shop at one of these stores or the other, this resulting "injustice" might be the case, and I can see how you might imagine such an injustice given the standard rational model of supply and demand, however, a map is not the territory in the same way a scale model train set is not going to carry full sized people and cargo.
