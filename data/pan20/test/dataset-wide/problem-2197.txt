It's actually fairly common in U.S. auto racing; teams in those sports are often family owned and passed down between generations. 

Lots of reasons. First, and primarily, there are a lot of sports, and sports teams, competing for spectators' attention in the U.S., and the subsequent ad dollars for TV airtime, stadium naming rights, on-field logos, etc. I realize there are other sports besides soccer in Europe, but the gap in overall popularity between association football and basketball or handball in Europe is much wider than the one between the big three team sports in the U.S. There are also more teams in each top-tier sports league in the U.S. than in the English Premiere League (or anywhere else in UEFA), with 32 NFL teams, and 30 teams each in the NBA, NHL and MLB. More teams means more games means more airtime needed. Second, and just as important, is risk/reward for the players. Gridiron football is a violent, dangerous sport, and to be picked in the NFL Draft says as much about your ability to avoid injury as it does for your skill. Despite this, ejections are relatively uncommon in gridiron football, so it's an exceptional case when a player is called to answer for causing injury to an opponent. The result is that, by the time a football player is drafted into the NFL, they may already be at the halfway point of their career in terms of the wear and tear on their bodies, which will stay with them the rest of their lives. There simply isn't enough reward inherent in playing the game at anything less then the premiere professional level to justify the risks the game presents. Association football, in contrast, is technically a non-contact sport; aggressive actions made towards opposing players are penalized. As a result, injuries in soccer, though they do happen, tend to be more minor, and players who deliberately injure opponents are held to account for those actions more frequently. That allows soccer players to have careers spanning decades, rather than the average of about 10 years that you see for NFL players other than QBs and kickers. Now, this emphasis on injury being against the spirit of the game is seen in other U.S. sports, even hockey in more recent times, and you do see longer careers in those leagues, with basketball and baseball players continuing to dress for games into their 40s. However, the mentality of "move up or move aside" is still prevalent as players grow up through the school leagues; if you don't end up playing for the pros, there's not much money or opportunity continuing to play past your college years. Which leads to the next reason; in the U.S., the player, not the team, is regarded as being mobile. The sports that do have notable minor leagues in the U.S., being baseball and hockey, typically have teams in various tiers that are either owned outright by one franchise or have partnership agreements. That's in addition to the prevalence of college sports teams in the U.S. (and by the by, if you want to see a loyal sports fan on the level of European soccer fans, don't look at the pros; look at college grads cheering their alma mater). The net result is that the player "grows up" through a series of teams, hopefully developing into a player that can compete in the premiere leagues, and the job of all the lower leagues is to help the player with that development, then let him go. In Europe, it's not just the player but the team that is mobile in the overall structure of the league. They player still grows, still develops, but the team that helped him do that is much more willing to try to hang on to him if they can, because this star striker or forward midfielder could be the ticket to a league championship and promotion. We still haven't gotten exactly to why the U.S. hasn't bought into that same mentality, though, and the next reason is the one I think is most important; geographical coverage. The U.S, without Alaska (no professional sports teams in that state to speak of), is about the same size as all of non-Nordic Europe combined. That means that maintaining a national fan base for a sports league in the U.S. requires paying very careful attention to the geographic dispersal of your teams. In England, you'll notice the EPL teams are concentrated in the London metro and the Manchester/Merseyside area, with Birmingham growing up as a third center for English football. That's mainly happened through promotion and relegation; teams in urban centers have more spectators, get more ticket and ad revenues, can afford to hire better players, and become better teams, moving up into the premiere league and forcing out the teams from outlying areas. Now, that's OK in a country with a total land size about the same as that of the U.S. Eastern Seaboard; if you want to cheer on a premiere-league team, there's one within a couple hours of pretty much any town in England. Or, as the commenter states, you can keep cheering for your hometown team even if they're not in the premiere league. In the U.S., however, that kind of league management would result in a disproportionate number of teams being crammed into the East Coast cities, much as the EPL's teams have gravitated to London and Manchester/Merseyside. That would place a lot of large "heartland" cities, each with populations in the millions, at least a day or more away from the nearest professional team by car. With no minor leagues to speak of due to the risk-reward problems of many of these sports, support for the sport in any form in areas without a major team would simply die out, robbing the leagues of valuable TV time. That would be compounded by the concentration of teams in the most populous areas, which force teams to fight each other for the biggest slice of the revenue pie. As a result, teams are carefully managed by franchise owners and league leadership to ensure that the teams are spread as evenly as can be supported around the populous areas of the U.S., giving each team a built-in home crowd. That, in turn, requires the teams to be kept on roughly equal footing; it's in the league's best interest to keep all of the teams it has financially healthy and competitive, and the two go hand in hand. So, instead of punishing franchises that can't buy a good team, we give the worst teams the first picks of new incoming talent. Instead of letting the richest teams self-perpetuate by spending more money on talent than anyone else can, we put salary caps in place to ensure no team can spend more than any other on their players. The current scheduling system even gives each team a game against a team from another conference they normally wouldn't play, with the same division ranking as their own, meaning the better teams have overall tougher opponents. This egalitarian approach lets dynasties rise and fall over a period of a few years each instead of a few decades (as is seen in baseball and in collegiate sports, where the school's reputation as a sports powerhouse is self-perpetuating over long timespans), and gives every franchise and every fan the best chance for their team's success. 

One thing not mentioned; if there weren't eligible receivers, then if the pocket broke down, all the QB would have to do is throw the ball at the center's feet and he'd never get sacked. Under current rules that's intentional grounding, because a legal forward pass must be made to a spot with an eligible reciever in the area (and cross the line of scrimmage). 

Basically, the golf ball that is best for you depends on what you need out of a golf ball, and that depends on the rest of your game including the course you play on. Without going into a doctoral dissertation on the subject, the two most important factors, IMO, are compression and spin characteristics. Compression is the "squishiness" of the ball. A low-compression ball is softer, requiring less force to compress. This will keep the ball on the clubface longer, imparting more "impulse" from the clubhead to the ball, and it will also induce more spin as the clubhead has more time in contact with the ball to get it spinning. They also feel softer when hit, which is preferable to many players. But, they will waste some energy of a particularly powerful swing because the softer material won't completely return to its normal roundness until after it's left the clubhead (like bouncing on a trampoline but not straightening your legs fully until you're already back in the air). High-compression balls, almost the exact opposite; less time on the clubhead, less spin, harder feel, faster rebound. There's considerable debate about the true importance of compression on raw distance; there's not nearly as much in it, all other things being equal, in matching compression rating to swing speed as there is in matching your shaft flex. Most experts say that for the average player it's a question of feel; if you want your swing to feel like there was nothing in its way, go softer. If you want the ball to give you more feedback on ball striking, go harder. Spin characteristics are a function of practically every aspect of the ball's design, including, as mentioned, compression. A low-compression ball will get more contact with higher-lofted clubs that are swung at slower speeds than the driver, increasing their backspin, which increases their height and reduces their rollout, so they'll drop down onto the fairway or green and stay where you put them. Most harder balls will spin less, and so they won't climb as much or drop as sharply, so they'll roll longer. Great for distance, bad for control. Higher-quality (and more expensive) golf balls are made with multiple core layers to help give the best of both worlds. Outer layers are softer and compress more easily, inner layers are harder. The net effect is a plateau in the amount the ball can be compressed as swing speeds increase. Off the driver, total compression of the ball is limited by the inner core, so the ball rebounds faster, wasting less energy and spinning less. However, the outer layer will still compress easily enough against the clubface of a higher-lofted club, giving those clubs the additional spin they need for the shot shape golfers want when approaching the green. Mid-grade balls often have three-layer construction (two core layers and outer cover) while the top-grade balls commonly have four layers. These balls also often trade the more durable and cheaper but slicker ionomer plastic covers of two-piece balls for softer covers like urethane, which grabs both the clubhead at launch and the ground on landing to magnify spin at the cost of durability (hit a Pro V1 onto the cart path, or even out of a bunker, and odds are you'll need to retire it after that hole due to the damage the grit has caused to the cover layer). Dimple pattern can also affect spin, though in a more minor way. The exact number, size, depth and arrangement of dimples on the ball all affect the "boundary layer" of air passing around the ball in flight. Deeper dimples create a thicker boundary layer, reducing friction (the maximum depth of dimples is regulated by the Rules of Golf for this reason). Manufacturers have experimented with varying dimple patterns, with dimples of varying sizes, to create different flight characteristics, some more forgiving, others more consistent. 

It depends on the sport; some have very strictly defined rules for "amateur" versus "professional". Golf is one of them, and I believe tennis also makes this distinction. Basically, if you've ever been paid to play the game, or have accepted a prize for winning an event beyond a certain monetary value, you are said to have lost your "amateur status"; you are now a "professional" player, and cannot compete in events that are open to amateurs only, under threat of disqualification from the event, as well as possible criminal charges if by fraudulently competing as an amateur you win money or a prize. There are some exceptions; there is a minimum prize value that triggers this change, so amateur tournaments can give meaningful, valuable prizes to players without causing those players to unwittingly "turn pro". Additionally, token payments for instruction, like "gas money" or buying your instructor a beer in the clubhouse, don't trigger loss of amateur status. Additionally, an amateur player can, without any money changing hands, "renounce" his or her amateur status at any time. This is rarely done; typically a player will announce they are "turning pro" by accepting something that would invalidate their amateur status as a matter of course, such as taking the top prize at the U.S. Open or accepting a sponsorship deal. 

Longer tees are typically for woods and your driver, while shorter tees are for irons. The modern driver is a deep-faced club, so the distance between the sweet spot (which you want to put right on the ball) and the bottom edge of the club (which you want to avoid dragging over the ground) is the greatest of any club. In addition, most instructors tell you to tee the ball forward in your stance, often just behind your leading foot, so you're hitting up and out at the ball as you come out of your downswing; this gets you the optimum launch trajectory for maximum distance while minimizing backspin. This club, therefore, definitely calls for a deep tee. I tend to tee my drives with the ball's thickest point (as seen by the club) right at the upper edge of the face of my driver, and slightly inside the centerline. That allows me to take a swing that clears the "deck" and hits into the ball on the upswing, sending it right down the line. To get the height I want, I use about a 2.5" tee. However, practically every other club you might use from the tee box, even your higher-numbered woods, you more often hit from the turf on par-4s and 5s. You don't want to mess with that too much on the tee box; All the tee is providing here is a low-friction base and clearance from any irregularities in the turf of the tee box (which, for holes that call for a mid-iron off the tee, can get pretty chewed up). For holes that don't call for a drive, if I use a tee at all, I use it to just barely clear the turf so I can get the impact point up into the sweet spot of whatever club I use without taking too big a divot. Sometimes, I'll raise a teed ball for my 3-wood off the turf just a little bit to get some of that "hit up into it" action for better distance and less backspin. In these situations, I often scout around real quickly for a broken tee another golfer's discarded, with about half an inch to an inch of shaft on it, and use that instead of a full intact tee. 

No. Runners can only advance on a "live ball", and as soon as a foul ball hits the ground or goes out of play, it's "dead" until that ball or a replacement is delivered back to the pitcher. The fact that the defense attempted to do so and failed changes nothing; at least until the pitcher has control of the ball it cannot become live. 

A draw (or hook for those who can't control it) is accomplished by squaring the clubface perpendicular to the line of your body, then swinging from inside to out. As the clubhead moves from the left to the right (for a right-handed golfer) across the ball, it will induce the sidespin that makes the ball curve left. To do this, raise your backswing, and think about swinging down, then out at the ball as you swing through. Be careful to still strike the ball with the sweet spot; if you hit off the toe, it'll push or worse. Another method is to move the ball towards your trailing foot, and close the clubface slightly; the clubhead will move in a circle, and so its tangent direction further back in the swing will be more outward. However, the further back you move it, the higher the clubface will be in its arc at impact, so the ball will launch lower; if you want a "high" draw, you're going to want the ball to be more forward in your stance, so you hit it as you come up out of the bottom of the swing. If this is a tee shot, you may also tee it a bit higher to add some loft; the more of the club that's under the ball when it hits, the higher the ball will launch. Don't go crazy high, though, or the club can pass right under the ball, obliterate the tee, and send the ball pretty much straight up. Understand the clubface must remain square to the ball. If you open the clubface, you'll bring it in line with the swing path and the result will be a straight push. If you close it, you'll launch the ball left and it will curve "lefter"; a "snap hook".
