Only after it was chosen the best answer I could understand the question, I think :) The author want defend the idea of monism within metaphysics which argues that the variety of existing things in the universe are reducible to one substance or reality and therefore that the fundamental character of the universe is unity. A consequence of this view is that everyday objects such as tables, chairs, cars, buildings, and clouds do not exist. While there seem to be such things, this is only because there are elementary particles arranged in specific ways. For example, where it seems that there is a chair, there are only elementary particles arranged chairwise, like a chair. The particles we call a chair maintain a more or less stable arrangement for a while, which gives the impression of a single object. Unlike the pluralist point of view that there is many subatomic particles, the monist point the view is that there is just one type of substance, or a plank size fundamental substance/particle for example. A way to allow for the heterogeneity we see in the world without contradiction is to regionalize instantiation properties, for instance, the same particle show red here and green there, and to has distributional properties. Or create the "everything theory" of fundamental physics, to tie all the known forces into a unity. But suppose the monist world that create the universe for for us. If the monist makes her universe the object of scientific study, it will find that it behaves with the same complexity as the universe described by a pluralist. Thus what pluralist calls "different things", the monist calls "the same things." Understood this way, the distinction between monist and pluralist collapses and amounts to different ways of describing the same thing: a massively complex process that causes all the same monist's and pluralist's experiences. Presumably having made the case that the monist scientist is actually a pluralist scientist, the monist applies Occam's Razor, and suggests to the monist scientist to prefer the pluralist's standard external “reality” over something like a monist's "reality". This is because the standard pluralist "reality" fits all the data available to the scientist, and on the monist's hypothesis is impossible to find differences, rendering superfluous the more complicated wording to account for all forms of heterogeneity we see in the world. The "everything theory" of fundamental physics, to tie all the known forces into a unity does not yet exist. Monism is a hope. 

Like perception, introspection, memory, and testimony, a priori justification is fallible. One might be justified in believing something a priori, e.g., that every event has a cause, that is actually false. Many physicists think that some subatomic events occur at random and so have no cause. Besides being fallible, it seems that a priori justification is defeasible, a priori justification can be defeated by further evidence. Why couldn't a priori justification be defeated by empirical, not just a priori, considerations? Something like this has actually happened, Kant was a priori justified in believing that every event has a cause but, because of developments in sub-atomic physics, we are not, and that the Greeks were, all things considered, a priori justified in accepting Euclidean geometry but we are not because of developments in cosmology. 

There are many rationality meanings. Theoretical rationality applies to beliefs.A belief is rational if it is supported by reasons and, in particular, reasons that render this belief likely to be true. Equally a belief is rational if it is produced by reliable methods, that is, methods that tend to produce true beliefs. As Robert Nozick put it, reasons without reliability seem empty and reliability without reasons seems blind. The rationality of action, practical rationality, is taken to be a means-end issue: rational action consists in following the best strategy that will promote one’s aims. Rationality thus becomes goal directed, but the goals themselves are typically taken to be beyond rational adjudication. This purely instrumental conception of rationality can also be attributed to the rationality of belief. Therefore certain emotions can be practical rationality, that is, certain emotions can lead to optimal outcomes in the appropriate situation. It is not necessary to expanding the definition of rationality in philosophy to include optimal behavior, it is already part of a definition of rationality. In other words, the concept of practical rationality, whether pertaining to decisions, strategies, intentions, beliefs, or still something else, essentially involves the notion of a goal. To say that a belief or emotion is rational, then, is to say that the belief or emotion will contribute to the achievement of a particular goal. And to say that a belief or emotion is irrational is to say that the belief or emotion will not contribute to the achievement of a particular goal. When it comes to rationality of beliefs, the goals will obviously be intellectual ones, then it may be said that the goal to which a rational belief is directed is truth, or some other cognitive virtue. There is a sense in which the rationality of a belief is not an instrumental property of this belief. Rather it is a function of the epistemic relation between the evidence and the belief for which it is taken to be evidence, and hence a function of the soundness of the methods that produced and sustain these beliefs. 

Another one is Nietzsche. (Wellspring of Existentialism) Nietzsche is in some sense a free will skeptic, but he is also opposed to the thesis of determinism and the concept of an “unfree will” too: 

We do not know what we intend to do until the intention itself arises. To understand this is to realize that we are not the authors of our thoughts. Buddhism rejects the idea of an agent, and thus the idea that freedom is a free will belonging to an agent (Wikipedia). Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies have long ago cast off free agency. There are at least several million people on this planet who don't believe in free agency and seem to be living happy lives. Unlike plants, animals, we see our will as uncaused causes. It does not seem very plausible that the deterministic, causal relationships that existed in the universe for billions of years would suddenly suspend themselves to accommodate the relatively recent development of the brain’s nerve. How can a nondetermined choice provide people with any control over their behaviors? What would free will give us that we don't already have in a determined world? Love and gratitude seem to be built into us as part of our evolutionary heritage as social animals; they are part of what holds groups together and are products of determinism. Moral sentiments may be viewed as a reward mechanism, to make someone more sensitive to distant rewards and punishments. Hate and resentment have evolutionary components as well. Belief in free will reinforces hate by ascribing arbitrariness to those that who elicit them, they are seen as deliberately choosing those actions. Skill acquired by luck is still skill, and a skillful violinist sounds much different than one who has not been lucky enough to develop to the same level. We can express appreciation and gratitude for our good fortune in hearing a virtuoso performance without granting the performer free will. People advise their fellows of possible ways to improve their behavior do so because we are social animals that aid their fellows have better survival rates. Determinism don't say that the level of punishment we administer to defaulters is never determined by the extent they were in control of the events leading up their crimes. An efficient social contract won't call for penalties to be inflicted when the circumstances under which the crime was committed are such that inflicting the penalty won't deter similar deeds. If it can be demonstrated that Abel's death at the hand of Cain was accidental by pointing to the immediate cause of the crime, we don't need to follow the practice of our predecessors by holding Cain to blame. However there are plenty of exceptions, as with the continuing execution of mentally ill criminals in Texas. But when the causal chain is uncertain, our social contract needs to be ruthless. All of us, for example, are held to be guilty until proved innocent when it comes to paying tax. The extent of the damage suffered by a victim is often largely outside the criminal's control. For example, a mugger may hit two victims equally hard, but he will only be tried for murder if one of them happens to have an unusually thin skull. The doctrine that the seriousness of a crime is determined by the consequences to the victim also fits the same pattern: when the causal chain is uncertain, our social contract needs to be ruthless. Again, a social contract that doesn't discourage antisocial behavior won't survive, and so deviants have to be punished. The driver who neglects to check his brakes and is guilty, if no harm ensues, of mere negligence. But if through bad luck the driver kills a child in his path, he is judged and judges himself more harshly, even though his input is the same. We recognize that being imprisoned is unpleasant, but we don't ask whether people got infected by accident or through negligence by scarlet fever before temporarily quarantined them. We isolate them, because the alternative is that the disease will spread, and we don't want healthy people to catch it. To say that I am responsible for a given act means that, because the act arose here in my body/mind rather then somewhere else, I am liable for whatever the consequences may be of this arising. Deliberate punishment makes sense only if it has some kind of deterrent or rehabilitative value. The more freedom we assume that agent to have had in its choosing, the angrier we are likely to feel over the choice actually made. With the giving up of agency, speculating about either the past or the future becomes less interesting. We are drawn more intimately into the present. People will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. They regard their own choices as less predictable and give desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behavior, but rate personality traits as most predictive of other people. Any connection between conscious thought and action should be determined by scientific enquiry, and not by unreliable introspection and feelings. People consider acts more "free" when they involve making random actions for example. But notably random actions, may not be possible; when people attempt to perform tasks in a random manner their behavior betrays many patterns, such as generating random numbers. Hawking and Mlodinow suggest a thought experiment in which one encounters an alien that may be a robot. Is such a machine deterministic? We cannot predict the machine's exact behavior without a complete knowledge of its personal history with its environment, the reliability of its components, and its present state of programming, uncertainties in which limit us to probabilistic statements. An illusion of free will is created due to the generation of infinite or computationally complex behavior from the interaction of a finite set of rules and parameters. The unpredictability of the emerging behavior from deterministic processes leads to a perception of free will. Neuroscience is valuable in developing models of how the brain may construct our experience of free will. In alien hand syndrome, the afflicted individual's limb will produce meaningful behaviors without the intention of the subject. Unconscious will is not will or “free”will. The sense of agency does not emerge in conjunction with the overt appearance of the purposeful act even though the sense of ownership in relationship to the body part is maintained. The clinical definition requires feeling that one limb is foreign or has a will of its own, together with observable involuntary motor activity. This syndrome is often a result of damage to the corpus callosum, either when it is severed to treat intractable epilepsy or due to a stroke. The standard neurological explanation is that the felt will reported by the speaking left hemisphere does not correspond with the actions performed by the non-speaking right hemisphere.
