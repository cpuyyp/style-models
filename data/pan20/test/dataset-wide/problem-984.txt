There are few known mechanisms that lead to the generation of Rogue waves, such as the ones you mentioned, but essentially all Rogue waves are the due to the nonlinear wave dispersion characteristics of large groups of waves. I can imagine one approach to predicting the emergence of such waves is to simulate the evolution of initial wave states with Navier-Stokes based wave models that capture the nonlinear dynamics involved in real time. However, with the limited computational power and numerical techniques we have today, that is currently impossible. So I think the question is: Do we know of specific signatures in the ocean wave climate, which ultimately give rise to these so called "walls of water"? Presumably these wave patterns could serve as early warning indicators of an upcoming rogue wave event. There is indication that the emergence of solitons from modulational instability or dispersion of wave packets occurs in consonance with nonlinear effects and nonlocal coupling giving rise to Roge waves. Thus, an approach based on the spectral analysis of the sea-state as a whole or of particular envelopes of propagating waves may hint at particular wave-field patterns that originate Rogue waves. Please see the sources below for more information on the current state of the art. However, at the moment the answer is that forecasting Rogue waves is still much of an unknown. 

Great question. These features are mesoscale Eddies and they are akin to hurricanes in the atmosphere. They are the ocean’s high or low pressure systems and are the result of instabilities. The cyclonic eddy (counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere) is called a cold-core eddy and the anti-cyclonic eddy is called a warm-core eddy. 

Coastal trapped Kelvin waves are important processes contributing to variability in the sea surface height and temperature near the coast. Field studies have measured large temperature fluctuations mainly made up of low-frequency internal Kelvin waves mostly of semi-diurnal tidal period at the continental shelf on the great barrier reef (Wolanski, 1983). Because they are balanced by Coriolis, in the Northern Hemisphere they remain fairly stable if they are propagating towards the North if the coast is on the right, or to the South if the coast is to the left. 

Just to expand on the answer by @Siv: Previous studies have indeed suggested teleconnections between the jet stream and ENSO (for example: Horel 1981). Recall that, at a fundamental level, the jet stream (a westerly geostrophic wind pattern) is driven by horizontal North-South temperature gradients across cold and warm air masses (thermal wind). Thus, it can be enhanced by increasing the temperature gradient of the two air masses. Because winter frontal zones have characteristically larger temperature gradients than summer fronts, the jet stream is strongest during the boreal winter. It also moves equatorward to $30^o$ from its typical position in the summer of $50-60^o$. And as discussed in Chunzai Wang, 2002: 

It literally means that the water depth will be 0.5mm. For example, if you place a container under the rain and it fills up to 0.5mm, then the precipitation is 0.5mm. Despite the fact that a wide container requires more rain to fill up than a narrow container, the larger surface area allows it to collect the right amount of rain water to fill up to the same amount as the narrow container in the same amount of time (as long as the walls are vertical). Therefore, if the rainfall is 1 mm, every square meter receives 1 liter of rain water. Addendum: By the way, tuna cans can be distributed along your lawn to serve as a very primitive, but very cheap measurement tool that you can use to create a spatial map of what your irrigation system is doing. You can use that for troubleshooting your efficiency, 1 full can is 1 inch irrigation/rainfall. 

No, solar activity will not help offset anthropogenic warming in any significant way. Recent research says a grand solar minimum would cause no more than 0.3C cooling over the 21st century [Feulner & Rahmstorf (2010), Jones et al. (2012), Anet et al. (2013)] But to see the influence of the solar cycle on the earth's climate together with the effect of anthropogenic forcing see @userLTK's chart - it is key. Roughly after 1960 solar activity declines on average while temperature rampantly rises. Why? Atmospheric CO2: [the] Principal Control Knob Governing Earth’s Temperature . Although solar activity is modulating the earth's temperature the effect is relatively small and for all practical purposes - negligible. Otherwise the past 12,000 years of civilization would have been much tougher to endure.

One thing that I would add is a discussion of a physical parameter that is a simple measure of whether a wave is going to topple or not. The Froude number is defined as the ratio of the maximum absolute fluid velocity, $U$, and the wavespeed, $c$: $F = U/c$ Because of the mechanism explained by IRO-bot, 

I assume you are talking about the fluid dynamics description of flux, which is the rate of volume flow across a unit area. 1. 

When considering large scale processes varying on interannual scales ENSO, which is the coupled process of El Niño/La Niña SST anomalies and the Southern Oscillation, is relatively well predictable. However, the fidelity of the forecasting is modulated by the season, the phase and intensity of ENSO. For example, there is a decrease in skill during the so called "spring predictability barrier" where, during the boreal spring when SST anomalies are abnormally variable. Model drift (such as SST drift as the forecast progresses) and bias especially for a couple-model such as the ENSO, is a very real issue. After only a season the bias inherent in the results renders the forecasting unreliable to the point where the model may be unable to recognize different types of ENSO (such as classical East Pacific versus central Pacific ENSO events). So unfortunately at this time your specific question is still very hard to answer with any degree of satisfactory precision. But at least we know that it is not more than one season in the future.

As far as typical processes, this figure summarizes it pretty well. DNS resolves all scales of motion, all the way down to the Kolmogorov scale. LES is next up and resolves most of the scales, with the smallest eddies being modeled. RANS is on the other end of the spectrum from DNS, where only the large-scale eddies are resolved and the remaining scales are modeled. 

When you speak of an element the rationale is the same but will depend on whether the model you are devising contains 1D, 2D or 3D fluid elements. The latter is defined as above. 

the highest velocities are encountered at the top of the wave and therefore a good rule of thumb is, if the surface fluid velocity aproaches the wave speed, i.e $F \to 1$, then the wave will topple over. The question is what values of $F$ give rise to that perfect tube feeling that surfers yearn for and so perfectly exemplified by your picture. Of course, since $F > 1$ implies that the wave amplitude is large, linear theory is no longer helpful. We may have to wait until we can get some definite answers from DNS 3D simulations of oceanic scale wave breaking phenomena. 

Turbulence is a property of the flow, not a physical characteristic of the fluid. Turbulent flows in nature are evolving due to external influences and at present time there are very few evolving turbulent flows which are well understood. The boundary conditions, such as distribution of canopy, geomorphology, all play a crucial role in determining the turbulent dynamics. All turbulent flows are different but they have similar intrinsic dynamics and through statistical means one can relate the properties of the mean flow to the turbulent dynamics. "Big whorls have little whorls That feed on their velocity; And little whorls have lesser whorls; And so on to viscosity." Lewis Fry Richardson Turbulence is a multiscale phenomenon where small eddies in turbulence have very short timescales. This alone tends to make them statistically independent from the mean flow. Therefore, smallscale motion depends only on the rate at which it is supplied energy from the larger scales, and the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated into heat. The two rates of change are assumed the same so that the net rate of change is small comparing to the rate of dissipation. This is the basis for Kolmogorov's universal equilibrium theory. It basically says that the rate of energy supply to smallscale eddies is equal to the the dissipation rate: $$U^3/L \sim \epsilon \, .$$ In other words, the dissipative effects of viscosity can be estimated from the large scale dynamics, which are effectively inviscid. Inertial effects cause a transfer of energy from small to large wavenumber space by vortex stretching.The mean flow kinetic energy transforms into turbulent energy in the form of large eddies which cascade down to smaller eddies and so on, the remaining fluctuations are ultimately dissipated by viscous damping. Turbulent velocity fluctuations generate large momentum fluxes between different regions of the flow which is a process analogous to stress (Reynolds stresses). The Reynolds stress is what quantifies the contribution of the turbulent motion to the mean flow. Because the momentum transfer mechanism resembles molecular diffusion, turbulent moment exchange is modeled with an eddy viscosity. All this discussion is still inside the boundary layer itself. Outside the boundary layer is the mean wind which supplies the necessary shear for turbulence inside the boundary layer. Although this wind is not affected by the turbulent fluctuations within the boundary layer, it is the reason why they exist. 

Those formulas are based on an assumption that the pressure is hydrostatic and the ideal gas law. The example given is limited to 11km but uses the tables from the U.S. Standard Atmosphere which actually go up to $1000$ km. Starting at Page 58 one can find values for pressure density and temperature above 11km. 

Yes, they are called atmospheric tides. They can be caused by the gravitational effect of the moon on the atmosphere (lunar tides) and also differential solar heating (thermal tides). I believe you are asking about the former which is much weaker than the latter. You can find more about it here: $URL$ and $URL$ 

What affects the amount of precipitation on the leeward flank is a combination of all these parameters, the full expression is found in Roe and Baker (2006) and it is rather complicated. However, if we consider the limits $\Psi_{W,L}, \Theta_{W,L} >>1$, that is, steep trajectories of falling hydrometeors and large orogen size then asymptotically we can estimate the precipitation on the windward side $$P_w = \frac{R_0}{\mu}(1-e^{-\mu})$$ and on the leeward side $$P_L = \frac{R_0}{\Theta_L\mu}(e^{-\mu}).$$ The latter says that, for large orogen size as compared to moisture scale height (large $\mu$), the precipitation on the leeward side vanishes, $P_L \to 0$. This is because on the windward flank, the average precipitation approaches a finite upper bound as it depletes all moisture in the air column. 

All season forecast systems are subject to uncertainty. The uncertainty arises from an imperfect initial state, such as initial conditions, and from imperfect models, such as uncertainty due to, numerical methods, parametric models, data sampling. Forecasting systems utilize ensembles and their spread to quantify uncertainty. See the spread in forecasts for El Niño produced by a number of international models: 

The reference in the figure (where the plot was cropped from - the period 70M-50M years is missing) is helpful. The resolution on that plot is quite low but it can be seen that, for the past 50M years, the temperature is not always decreasing. There appear to be four main cooling trends flanked by periods of constant or increasing temperatures. According to the authors, the long-term cooling trend is a result of several processes that work together in a nonlinear way to modify the distribution of heat on the surface of the Earth. However, we require many more global records of temperature before we are able to quantify their respective contributions. From the paper: 

$L$ can be used to determine the eddy structure of the flow and it provides a measure for the hydrodynamic stability of the boundary layer - it effectively imposes an upper limit on the vertical excursion of fluid particles due to (negative) buoyancy forces. Using the example of a marine layer, if $Z_l$ is the boundary layer height, the dominant eddy structure (roll vortex motion, free convection or both) can be estimated with the parameter $-Z_l/L$ (its absolute value measures the stability of the boundary layer). Some common values categorizing the dominant eddy structure and morphology are given in (2). A summary is found in the table below:

As far as the El-Niño connection, I can only speculate. But generally, El-Niño will give rise to positive SST anomalies. The figure below shows recent positive SST anomalies which are relatively strong near the coast. Because ocean temperatures are higher ocean eddies can increase in size and strength. 

Yes you are correct. $$Specific~Discharge = \frac{Volumetric~Flux}{Area}$$ therefore $$Volumetric~Flux = Specific~Discharge~\cdot~Area$$ 2. 

Areas associated with velocity shear at a stratified interface are notably strong in the region of the Equatorial Undercurrent, straits (ex: strait of Gibraltar, the Bosphorus) and regions of the thermocline where internal waves are strong (South China Sea). These areas are typically associated with strong turbulence as a direct result of the strong velocity shear and shear instabilities that trigger Kelvin–Helmholtz billows (if the Richardson number is less than 1/4 for a sufficient amount of time) and subsequent hydrostatically unstable configurations and mixing. Examples of magnitude of shear:

How are they formed? Why are they so stable? What finally breaks them apart and what is their typical lifespan? Why are fluid particles trapped inside it and advected towards the center? How do they affect transport of particulate matter and heat in the ocean? 

You can think about it like this: It takes one day for the earth to perform a full rotation (about 86k seconds), on the other hand, it takes a few seconds for your sink to drain (lets say 10 seconds). So it takes 8600 times longer for the earth to do a full rotation than it takes the water to drain down the sink. It is not too hard to imagine that the earth's rotation can have no influence on the process of draining a sink (as compared to other forces it feels, due to various things such as imperfections in the sink, etc). However, if the sink was the size of lake Michigan and you were to drain it, Coriolis would play a role. 

The biggest difference between LES and RANS is that, contrary to LES, RANS assumes that $\overline{u'_i} = 0$ (see the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations). In LES the filter is spatially based and acts to reduce the amplitude of the scales of motion, whereas in RANS the time filter removes ALL scales of motion with timescales less than the filter width. I would recommend reading Fröhlich, Jochen, and Dominic von Terzi. "Hybrid LES/RANS methods for the simulation of turbulent flows." Progress in Aerospace Sciences 44.5 (2008): 349-377. From that paper, specifically the section 'Structural similarity of LES and RANS equations', you can see that the equations being solved are essentially the same for LES and RANS, however, the physics are different. The main difference being that in RANS the unclosed term is a function of the turbulent kinetic energy and the turbulent dissipation rate whereas in LES the closure term is dependent on the length scale of the numerical grid. So in RANS the results are independent of the grid resolution!

First some definitions: $z_0$: Roughness length is defined as the height at which the mean velocity is zero due to substrate roughness. Real walls/ground are not smooth and often have varying degrees of roughness, this parameter (which is determined empirically) accounts for that effect. $d$: Zero Plane displacement is defined as the height at which the mean velocity is zero due to large obstacles such as buildings/canopy. The two parameters are not the same because they describe the effects of two fundamentally different processes. $d$ can be anywhere from $6$ to $20$ times larger than $z_0$. The basis for most turbulence modeling is the eddy viscosity model: $$-\overline{u'w'} = \nu_t \frac{\partial U}{\partial z}$$ where $\nu_t$ is the eddy viscosity. Employing some scaling arguments with basis on the Prandtl mixing length model and integrating one arrives at the logarithmic law of the wall: $${U} = \frac{u^*}{\kappa} \ln\, \frac{z}{z_0}$$ Your equation is $${U} = \frac{u^*}{\kappa} \ln\, \frac{z-d}{z_0}$$ which is the law of the wall with $d = 0$ because it applies to flat plates. It is easy to see then, that by subtracting $d$ from $z$ the effect is to reduce $U$ at that height, which makes sense because large obstacles remove energy from the mean flow and slow it down. Note that if there are no large obstacles then $d \approx 0$, but $z_0$ is still larger than zero.
