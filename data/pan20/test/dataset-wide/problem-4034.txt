Concerning your second question you can have a look at theorem 11.1 "Multiplicativity of the L-theory fundamental class" of this paper: "The L-homology fundamental class for IP-spaces and the stratified Novikov conjecture" by Markus Banagl, Gerd Laures and Jim McClure (available on Banagl's homepage). 

If we consider cohomology with $\mathbb{Z}/2$-coefficients, if $M$ is a manifold $H^*(M;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ it satisfies Poincaré duality, and is an unstable algebra over the Steenrod algebra. Brown and Peterson in their paper "Algebraic bordism groups" (Annals of maths, 1964) had the wonderful idea to give an algebraic model of geometric bordisms in terms of algebraic bordisms of unstable algebras over the Steenrod algebra. They showed that this algebraic bordism group $N^{alg}_*$ is isomorphic to Thom's bordism group of smooth manifolds. For any unstable algebra algebra $A$ they define an algebraic bordism group $N^{alg}_*(A)$. In fact, they proved that for any space $K$, Conner, Floyd's bordism group $N_*(K)$ of non-oriented smooth manifold over $K$ is isomorphic to $N^{alg}_*(H^*(K;\mathbb{Z}/2))$. The isomorphism is given by a natural transformation: $$\phi_K:N_*(K)\rightarrow N^{alg}_*(H^*(K;\mathbb{Z}/2))$$ that sends a bordism class $f:M\rightarrow K$ to the algebraic bordism class of the induced map $f^*:H^*(K;\mathbb{Z}/2)\rightarrow H^*(M;\mathbb{Z}/2)$. Not only thanks to Wu formulas (that use Poincaré duality and Steenrod squares action on $H^*(M;\mathbb{Z}/2)$), you can recover Stiefel-Whitney numbers, and you can determine if two manifolds are cobordant but using the unstable algebra structure of $H^*(K;\mathbb{Z}/2)$ you can recover the geometric bordism group of $K$. 

Diffeological spaces are examples of generalized smooth spaces, they give a complete and cocomplete category of spaces including smooth spaces as a full subcategory. A diffeological space is a set together with a diffeology: a collection of plots (maps from a numerical domain) which determines the smooth structure. For these diffeological spaces you have the concept of inductions and subductions. Let me focus on inductions they are morphisms $f:(X,D)\rightarrow (X',D')$ such that $f^*(D')=D$ ($D$ is the pull-back diffeology of $D'$ along $f$) and $f$ is injective. For smooth manifolds with their induced diffeology, every induction is an immersion but an immersion is not necessarily an induction even it is injective. Rather an immersion is a local induction. Thus at least for diffeological spaces if you want to generalize immersions you have to work locally (with a superset of every point). You also have local inductions, subductions. You can have a look at P. Iglesias-Zemmour's book "Diffeology" (published by the AMS). 

I am searching for R. Bott's lectures on characteristic classes and Gel'fand Fuks cohomology (New Mexico State Univ. 1973), apparently there are notes of these lectures taken by Mostow and Perchik which were published in some proceedings. But I was not able to find these proceedings. Thank you in advance for your help. 

I recommend you to have a look at the first chapter of Roger Fenn's book "Techniques of geometric topology". 

Let $X$ be a topological space and $R$ be a commutative ring with unit, $D(X,R)$ is the derived category of unbounded complexes of sheaves of $R$-modules. Moreover we suppose that $X$ is a stratified space and $D_c(X,R)\subset D(X,R)$ is the derived category of complexes of sheaves with constructible cohomology sheaves. The categories $D(X,R)$ and $D_c(X,R)$ are both closed symmetric monoidal categories, thus we can speak of their Picard groups as the group of isomorphism classes of invertible objects for the derived tensor product. I was wondering if we know some computations of the Picard group of $D(X,R)$ or of $D_c(X,R)$? 

There are many applications of numerical invariants (LS-category) to differential geometry, but let me give one pretty example to resolution of polynomial equations. In the paper "On the equation of degree 6" Comment. Math. Helv. 79 (2004) 605–617 C. De Concini, C. Procesi and M. Salvetti prove using the schwartz genus of fibrations that 5 holomorphic functions suffice to compute the roots of a polynomial of degree 6. ....... Definition: For a fibration $p:A\rightarrow B$ the Schwarz genus $g(p)$ is the minimum number for which one can cover the base with open sets $U_i$ so that the fibration, restricted to $U_i$ is trivial. Let $\mathcal{P}_n$ be the space of of monic polynomials of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{C}$ with distinct roots. Let $\Delta$ be the big diagonal $$\Delta=\{(z_1,\ldots,z_n)\in \mathbb{C}^n:z_i\neq z_j, \forall i\neq j\}$$ then $\mathcal{P}_n=(\mathbb{C}^n-\Delta)/S_n$ (where $S_n$ is the symmetric group). And let consider the covering: $$\gamma_n:\mathbb{C}^n-\Delta\rightarrow \mathcal{P}_n$$ Concini, Procesi and Salvetti prove that $g(\gamma_6)=5$. Let me add that the genus of $\gamma_n$ is related to topological complexity of algorithms that should compute the roots of a polynomial (S. Smale, "On the topology of algorithms I", Journal of complexity 3 (1987), 81–89.). 

Let us remenber that we have the following proposition of Artin and Mumford (in "Some elementary examples unirational varieties which are not rational" proposition 1.): "The torsion subgroup $T_2\subset H^3(V,\mathbb{Z})$ is a birational invariant of a complete non-singular complex variety $V$ of any dimension $n$." Question : Are there other any other type of singular cohomological information (even homotopical) which is known to be a birational invariant of complete non-singular complex varieties? 

3.The situation is completely different in the unstable range. A nice survey is "Dalian notes on rational Pontryagin classes" by Michael Weiss. Refs: 

I have some very naive questions on conifold transitions: In this case conifold transitions depend on choices of 125 3-cycles which are 125 embedded 3-spheres in $Y_{\epsilon}$ whose contractions kill a copy of $\mathbb{Z}^{\oplus 101}$ in $H_3(Y_{\epsilon},\mathbb{Z})\cong \mathbb{Z}^{\oplus 204}$. 1) How do we choose these 125 cycles to get $Y$? More precisely, we need at least 101 non-trivial homological 3-spheres, a naive choice would be to pick 101 copies of $S^3$ representing the 101 generators of $\mathbb{Z}^{101}\subset H_3(Y_{\epsilon},\mathbb{Z})$ and 24 $S^3$ which are homologicaly trivial, but I guess this is too naive. I suppose that the 3-cycles need to satisfy some relations what are these relations? Are these homological conditions if they exist sufficient? 2) I suppose that the small resolution also depends on these choices, in particular do we know the cohomology algebra of the small resolution. I know the Hodge Diamond of the cohomology of $Y_s$ but I would like to know its algebra structure. 

Edit: if you want to play with dgas, then the only thing that you have to change in the example above is the cofibration resolution of the algebra $A(S^2)$. You start with $(T(x_2,x_3),D)$ the tensor algeba on $2$ generators with differential $D(x_2)=0$ and $D(x_3)=x_2\otimes x_2$ it has the same cohomology as $A(S^2)$ until the differential degree $5$ where you have created a new cycle :$[x_3,x_2]=x_3\otimes x_2-x_2\otimes x_3$ which is not a boundary. Then you have to add a generator $x_4$ to kill this cycle i.e. you put $D(x_4)=[x_3,x_2]$. And so on and so forth, it is easy to check that all the generators you add to $(T(x_2,x_3),D)$ in order to build a cofibrant resolution of $A(S^2)$ will have degree at least $4$. With this resolution in hand you check that a homotopy class of morphism of dgas is also completely determined by the image of $x_3$. 

The construction of the map $$D_2(C^*)\rightarrow C^*$$ goes back at least to N. E. Steenrod. In his beautiful paper "Products of cocycles and extensions of mappings", Ann. of Math. (2) 48 (1947), 290–320, he gives a very explicit combinatorial description of this map. Take for $E\mathbb{Z}/2$ the chain complex whose i-chains ($i\geq 0$) are generated by the regular reprensation of the symmetric group $\mathbb{Z}/2=\{e,\tau\}$ i.e we have $$(E\mathbb{Z}/2)_i=\mathbb{Z}<e_i,\tau.e_i>$$ together with $de_i=e_{i-1}+(-1)^{i}\tau.e_{i-1}$. $e_i$ corresponds to the $i$-th cup-i product. N. E. Steenrod gives in his paper an explicit formula for the action of the cup-i product on cochains. This formulas can be found in many papers and many works where they were extended to an $E_{\infty}$-structure on singular cochains. One can cite: 

As $M$ is compact this implies that $\pi_1(M)$ is finitely presented thus that $M$ is simply connected (*). Together with the second point it implies that $M$ has the homotopy type of a sphere. And you conclude using the Poincaré conjecture that $M$ is homeomorphic to a sphere. Edit (*): we have to use a non-trivial theorem in group theory about the minimal number of generators $m(G)$ of a group $G$. Namely we have $m(G*H)=m(G)+ m(H)$ (conjectured by Levi and proved independently by Gruschko and Neumann). 

In rational homotopy theory models of homotopy push-outs are homotopy pull-backs in the category of CDGAs. This fact follows from the Quillen adjunction between model categories of spaces and CDGAs. In fact this is just a Mayer-Vietoris type argument. (1) is a homotopy push-out: $X\rightarrow Y$ is a cofibration and (1) is a push-out. To get an algebraic model of (1) you should build a surjective model of the map $f:X\rightarrow X_1$ and then take the pull-back along the model of the map $X\rightarrow Y$ and you will get a model of (1). And that's what you have done. 

You should look at Greg Friedman's book: $URL$ CS-sets are discussed in section 2.3. In fact for many purposes it is rather interesting to suppose that the links $L$ are just compact filtered topological spaces and not CS-sets. Deligne's axioms for intersection homology sheaves are easy to verify in this setting where we just suppose that links are compact. The definition does not imply $L$ is itself a CS-set. Such a recursive assumption is useful when you want to study pseudomanifolds and Poincaré duality of pseudomanifolds in intersection homology. 

Maybe my answer will not fit exactly your question. What I like very much is D. Sullivan's use of Artin-Mazur's theory in his proof of Adams'conjecture. What D. Sullivan does is the computation of the étale homotopy type of the classifying space $BU_n$ of the complex unitary group and he does this computation by considering this classifying space as a direct limit of complex Grassmannians: $$G_{n,k}\cong GL(n+k,\mathbb{C})/(GL(n,\mathbb{C})\times GL(k,\mathbb{C}))$$ Then he analysises the étale homotopy type of $BU_n$ by looking at its associated arithmetic square. What is important in Sullivan's proof of the Adams'conjecture is the understanding of the action of the absolute galois group on the étale homotopy type of $BU_n$ which has a deep impact on Adams operations in $K$-theory. In his MIT notes "Geometric Topology Localization, Periodicity, and Galois Symmetry" he also states a conjecture, now a theorem: "the Sullivan's conjecture", that has some important implications on the study of the étale homotopy type of real algebraic varieties. Of course all this material can be found in section 5 "Algebraic geometry (étale homotopy type)" of the notes cited above with many examples. 

May I suggest you the following monographs: " Homotopy of Operads and Grothendieck-Teichmüller Groups" by Benoit Fresse available here: $URL$ together with video recordings of a master degree course on that subject $URL$ 

Before talking of moduli, which certainly is a very good way to treat the set of subvarieties of given dimension and degree of a fixed projective space, you can try to understand Chow varieties which is exactly the algebraic variety whose points are all cycles of a given projective space of given dimension and degree. This is easier because we have coordinates called the Chow coordinates. This is done in J. Harris' book "Algebraic geometry: a first course" GTM springer, here you will find a very nice chapter on parameter spaces and moduli spaces (lecture 21). In this lecture he also introduces the point of view of Hilbert schemes. And then you can read chapter $VI$, section $VI.2.2$ of "The geometry of schemes" by D. Eisenbud and J. Harris (GTM springer). Edit: many thanks for your comments, determining the dimension of Chow varieties (the maximum of the dimension of its components) is not easy, for curves you have a paper by D. Eisenbud and J. Harris "The dimension of the Chow variety of curves." Compositio Math. 83 (1992), no. 3, 291–310. and they set a conjecture for higher dimensional subvarieties of projective spaces. I am sorry but do not know what is the state of the art. Concerning Chow varieties vs Hilbert schemes in this paper they make the following remark: ".... The second reason for working with Chow rather than Hilbert is that the Hilbert scheme will have aditionnal components whose general are not of pure dimension (e.g. consist of the union of a reduced curve and a zero dimensional subscheme). For all we know these components may have larger dimension than those corresponding to components of the Chow variety." 

In his 1974 ICM adress "Poids dans la cohomologie des variétés algébriques", Pierre Deligne explains that any finite polyhedron has the same homotopy type as a complex algebraic variety (section 6.). Let us take a finite polyhedron $P$, what obstructions do we know on $P$ in order to prove that $P$ has not the same homotopy type as a complete complex variety? Edit: for example, we know that spheres $S^{2k}$ with $k>1$ cannot have the homotopy type of a smooth complete, complex algebraic space because for these spaces the second singular cohomology group $H^2\neq 0$. And for the same reason it cannot have the same homotopy type of a projective variety. But can we prove that $S^{2k}$ cannot have the homotopy type of a possibly singular complete complex variety using cohomological arguments? In such generality we cannot use only $H^2$ because we know examples of complete nonprojective singular varieties with $H^2=0$. 

Let $Y\subset \mathbb{C}P^4$ be the quintic threefold given by the equation $$X^5_0+X^5_1+X^5_2+X^5_3+X^5_4+5X_0X_1X_2X_3X_4=0$$ it has 125 singular points whose links are homeomorphic to $S^2\times S^3$. This threefold is a deformation of a smooth Calabi-Yau manifold $Y_{\epsilon}$ $$X^5_0+X^5_1+X^5_2+X^5_3+X^5_4+5(1+\epsilon)X_0X_1X_2X_3X_4=0$$ The Betti numbers of $Y$ are: $b_0=b_6=1$, $b_1=b_5=0$, $b_2=1$, $b_3=103$, $b_4=25$, those of $Y_{\epsilon}$ are: $b_0=b_6=1$, $b_1=b_5=0$, $b_2=b_4=1$, $b_3=204$. For a small value of $\epsilon$ one can perform a conifold transition: 

they have isomorphic rational cohomology algebra, they have isomorphic rational homotopy Lie algebras $\pi_*(\Omega M_i)\otimes \mathbb{Q}$, they are not rationally homotopy equivalent. 

Let me give some examples and remarks: . When $n=3$ we know that $V(d,3)$ is diffeomorphic to a connected sum of $S^2\times S^3$. . $V(2,n)$ is the sphere bundle of the tangent bundle of $S^n$. 

As a reference I recommend this paper by K. Behrend: $URL$ Cech cohomology and De Rham cohomology can be defined for differentiable stacks using a double complex associated to the underlying Lie groupoid. These two cohomologies are isomorphic (see remark 10 p. 262). Singular cohomology is also defined in this paper (see p. 280), and for real coefficients we have a De Rham isomorphism (see p. 289). Proposition 36 gives an isomorphism, for any Deligne-Mumford stack $\mathfrak{X}$, between singular cohomology $H^*(\mathfrak{X};\mathbb{Q})$ and the singular cohomology of its coarse moduli space $H^*(\overline{\mathfrak{X}};\mathbb{Q})$. Example: consider the stack $BG$ where $G$ is a finite group, its coarse moduli space is just a pointy and you recover that rational coholology of $BG$ which is the cohomology of group of $G$ with rational coefficients is trivial. 

It is not necessary but it is a good idea to learn about more "classical" definitions. A good place is the stacks project: $URL$ where you will find a chapter on derived categories. Behrang Noohi has written a nice survey:"Lectures on derived and triangulated categories" available on arXiv. 

Let $M$ be a closed $C^{\infty}$-manifold, then for any $k>0$ the canonical inclusion: $$Diff^{C^{\infty}}(M)\subset Diff^{C^{k}}(M)$$ is a homotopy equivalence. Embed $M$ in an euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a $C^{\infty}$-submanifold and build a smoothing operator by using the convolution product. 

Let me give you an example which has a topological flavour. Let us consider, the De-Rham complex of differential forms on a sphere $S^n$, we denote it $A^*(S^n)$, it is a formal commutative differential graded algebra. Let us look at the morphisms of commutative differential graded algebras between $A(S^2)$ and $A(S^3)$ into the derived category. A good way to compute them is to take a cofibrant replacement of $A(S^2)$, such a cofibrant resolution is given by the algebra $(\mathbb{R}[x_2]\otimes\Lambda(x_3),D)$ where the differential satisfies $D(x_2)=0$ and $D(x_3)=x_2^2$. And as $A(S^3)$ is formal you can replace it by its cohomology algebra which is the exterior algebra $\Lambda(y_3)$. It is easy to see that a morphism of algebra $\phi$ between these two algebras is completely determined by the image of $x_3$ thus by a real number $\lambda$ such that $\phi(x_3)=\lambda.x_3$. We have proved: $$[A(S^2),A(S^3)]_{CDGA}\cong\mathbb{R},$$ while $H(\phi)=0$. This example has a topological flavour because it is a way (not the best of course) to show that $\pi_3(S^2)\otimes \mathbb{R}\cong \mathbb{R}$. People in rational homotopy theory have studied the concept of formality for morphisms:
