The higher the number the higher the component level. Current 11 speed Dura Ace is 9000 series. Last year's 10 speed Dura Ace was 7900. The series prior was 7800. For Ultegra, the upcoming, not yet released group for Ultegra will likely be 8000. The current is 6700 for most components. 6600 was the prior group, and 6500 before that. If the 3rd number is a 5, as in 6650, (ususally only noted on the crank) then the group came with a compact crank. If the 4th number is not zero, it is either a revision, in the case of CN-6501 or 6502, or designed for a triple crank. This will be noted on all parts, as shifters and derailleurs also must change for a triple geared crank, in most cases. If the 3rd number is a 7, i.e. FD-6770 the part was designed for electronic shifting. This will be on derailleurs, batteries, wiring, and shift levers. If you find a number on any single component, it can be used to date the whole group set. I hope that is useful. 

Lubricating the eyelet with oil, and the spoke threads with Spoke prep or linseed oil is recommended. Anti seize is not lubricant. It should not be used in this capacity. 

First, no MTB braze-on front derailleurs are currently made, and certainly none with the capacity to handle a 52/36t shift. Second, your backup plan is the correct path. Get a road flat bar shifter set. I have no hands on experience with the microshift shifters, but the SHIMANO Tiagra 4703 flat bar triple shifters, or the R770/780 sets are what you need. Either will work, and the Tiagra are cheaper and more readily available in my experience. Documentation can be found at $URL$ 

Using the sensor menu on your edge 510, delete the sensor. Make sure you have a fresh CR-2032 battery in the GSC 10 Speed & Cadence sensor. There is a button on the bottom right corner of the GSC 10. It acts as an indicator light as well as the reset button. Hold it down for 5 seconds. It should flash red and green. Press the SEARCH button in the sensors meny of the EDGE 510. Spin the wheel. It will flash each time the wheel rotates for a few seconds, then it will go dark. The EDGE 510 should pop up a message saying "Speed & Cadence sensor FOUND" 

No, with either the 8 or 11 speed Alfine hub, there is no possibility of using it on a 120mm frame. The hub shell itself is about 120mm wide, without the cable carriers for shifting, or any spacers at all. If, as it appears from your 120mm reference, you are considering a fixed gear frame with that spacing, then you should reconsider. 120mm spaced dropouts are typical on track specific frames, or track frames from very traditional builders. Frames like these will also have geometries which are not suited to use on the road, and I assume you don't want the bike for the velodrome, since you want gears. There are plenty of fixie frames with 130m or or 135mm dropouts. If it is 130mm and steel, you will have no trouble adjusting the frame to fit a 135. Otherwise, you should use a 135mm spaced frame, which likely means a hybrid or mountain bike single speed frame, or a frame with a concentric bottom bracket. 

NOTES ON DT-1 USE: Like all machining, use a cutting fluid such as Park Tool CF-2. If there is some "chatter" on the surface, the cut will still be square to the axle and the brake will mount properly to the disc. Change the amount of pressure and speed of the cutter to reduce chatter. 

No, a 28" tire is 700c generally, but a 27" tire will not fit. Tubes, on the other hand, will work just fine. 

The standard for what "true" means varies by mechanic and the intended use of the wheel. A perfectly true wheel, in the mechanical sense, may not be attainable. Roundness and lateral runout are measurable to .001 millimeters using commonly available shop tools. Most mechanics do not consider that tolerance necessary, but as that is the limit of the tools, that is what I would consider perfectly true. However it requires 4 things: 

Well, there's the Cars-R-Coffins website, but i don't know of any shops that are actively anti-car. It's pretty counter productive, and even if you push the green dream pretty hard, it's generally recognized that positive input is better than negativity. For example: Most people respond better to, "I ride my bike because it's good, cheap transportation, and environmentally sound." than they do to, "Stop killing the planet with your 6 mpg Hummer H2, you inconsiderate #$@%!*..." There are advocacy organizations that will push the line pretty hard, but retailers and wholesalers have to maintain balance a bit better than that. FTR, I don't think you are insensitive to this, i just think it's an answer that you pretty much stated in your question. 

Yes. One 16 gram cartridge is enough to fill an average 29" tire. I just tested in my Schwalbe Rocket Ron 29x2.25, and from empty it gets to about 38 psi. I run tubeless, so normal pressure at my 110kg weight is around 35-38psi. With a tubed setup, 38psi might be a touch low, but plenty to get you back in off the trail. 

The Lizard Skins Lock-on Logo grip is 31.06mm in diameter. The Lizard Skins Lock-on North Shore grip is 30.94mm in diameter. Both were measured using a digital caliper, and assuming a small difference in diameter due to texture, they are nominally 31mm diameter grips. The thinner Lizard skins grips measure approximately 29-30mm, again depending on texture. For instance, the Peaty measured 30mm, and the Charger measured 29mm, but was difficult to get a consistent measurement from because of the type of surface. I hope that helps. 

I was able to make a pattern out of paper and take very careful measurements From a Foil 10 frame. Without that ability, I would not have been confident enough to do this mod. 

It is normal and acceptable for a frame to be delivered with paint needing to be removed from the bottom bracket shell, headtube, and seat tube areas. It is assumed that a qualified mechanic with appropriate tools available will be assembling the bike, and that preparation of the frame is simply one of the necessary steps in the build process. Indeed, most every bike company requires that the frame be assembled by a qualified mechanic (and in some cases by a mechanic certified by the bike brand) in order to maintain the warranty on the frame or the bike. Unless there is something preventing the frame from being prepared properly, then this is unlikely to be considered a warranty issue. 

A rim is a piece of aluminum extrusion, rolled and joined into a hoop. There are several types of joints used. Rims can be pinned together using a piece of metal at the seam to hold the alignment. Or the seam can be aligned and welded. This is the strongest method. Welded rims used to have a small bump at the seam from the welding process, which would wear smooth from brake use. Someone came up with the idea to weld the seam for strength and then machine the braking surface smooth, which is the strongest and best kind of joint possible on a rim. 

To answer the question directly, yes, if your tube is losing air that quickly, it needs repair. It is not a matter of simply being too old. There is likely a very small hole or a leak in the valve. Replace the tube, or patch it. Benzo's soapy water suggestion will work very well. 

The best option is to make your own tires as previously stated. Since you don't like the idea of using nails or screws as studs, (which I agree with), try using pop rivets instead. It is more time consuming, but they work better, are more durable, and will stay in place better than a nail or screw. Use a small, sharp drill, usually 1/8", and drill through the knobs of the tire from the inside of the casing. Select a pop rivet which will just protrude from the knob of the tire. Stainless steel is most durable. Place 2-4 rivets approximately every 4 inches around the tire. (On a 16 inch tire, 2 inches might be better.) Fill the divot created by the compression of the rivet on the inside of the tire with silicon. That prevents the back of the rivet from popping the tube when installed. I hope this helps. 

Your title answers your question. After the ride, wipe down the bike so that there is no excess moisture. Make sure that the bike is stored indoors, in a dry, warm environment, so that any remaining moisture can evaporate. If you have a steel frame, consider using a frame preparation like Frame Saver, if you're going to ride in the rain regularly. And last, make sure you do you regular maintenance. Open up all the bearing areas (hubs, headset, and bottom bracket) and clean and grease them regularly. Grease is protection from water and corrosion as much as it is a lubricant, so this is important to keep it running smoothly, as well as protect from weather. I hope that helps. 

Phil Wood Hubs rarely have issues. If it is the pawls that are the problem, a rebuild kit will be enough. They are replaceable parts. They are the "teeth" that the freehub use to drive the hub shell (and the rest of your wheel) forward. Let them try a rebuild. You won't lose anything by it, and it will be faster than an RMA. But if you continue to have issues after, then warranty the hub. 

Without experience, or obvious damage, a cassette gauge like the one from Rohloff, or mileage are your best options for deciding when to replace a cassette. For me, a good rule of thumb has been: 

Most automotive use grease is too thick for bicycle applications. It will lubricate, but it will add friction to the movement of the bike. Aside from the "weight" of the grease, you only need to worry about purity. Phil Wood, of Phil Wood Components, used to say that his most important criteria for his bicycle grease was too make sure it matched the color of his original green sample. If it varied, even a little, he was besieged by inquiries about what he'd changed in his "formula". 

Assuming you have braze-ons for a rack on your frame, you should be abl to get a rack fairly easily. Racks are made with the basic characteristics of the bike in mind. You need to pay attention to: 

While Machismo answers the question asked, the reason why there is that reaction is mainly a lack of understanding about how and why compact cranks exist. Obviously, you can look at it and say to give us better climbing (easy) gears. But what many people miss is the rear ratio changes. The race standard for many years was 53/12. That is, the hardest gear, made up of the largest tooth count in the front, and the smallest in the back, was a 53 tooth front chain ring paired with a 12 tooth rear cog. A few years back, Shimano started making an 11 tooth rear cog. It was originally intended for pro racers and time trialists. Somebody got out the calculator, and realized that with that 11 tooth rear cog now available, you could decrease the size of the front rings, and get the same gear ratio, or slightly faster. That decreased front ring size allowed better climbing ratios when paired with the large cogs on the cassette, but also maintained the high gear speed racers are used to. Someone riding a properly setup compact crank, actually is pushing a harder, faster gear than the 53/12 "standard". That said, if you pair a 53 with the 11 tooth, it will be faster yet, but not often do you find the legs to push that combo. I've included gear inch charts for both, so that you can see for yourself how it works out. If you are not aware, gear inches are a comparison to the effective diameter of a direct drive wheel, when gear advantage is accounted for. 

You can get other colors of tires, but they aren't usually available because if the tire is made with the tread actually a different color, they must use different more expensive additives to increase durability. (See Carbon Black answer above) In addition, on colored tires, the tread portion of the tire rarely looks good for any length of time after being ridden. So customers aren't often satisfied with the product for very long. Since the same matching effect can be achieved by the sidewalls being colored, most manufacturers go that way instead. Lastly, most retailers prefer not to stock a tire that is limited in use to only the few bikes which match the tire color. Tires are expensive, and bulky to store. So why fill your wall space with 5 colors of one model of tire, when you can give better service to more customers by stocking one color of five models in the same space. 

A 59-61cm frame, most likely. Also, I would recommend you up your budget a fair bit, unless you are willing to replace the bike in a relatively short time. The weight of a frame should not be a major consideration for you, but the lateral and vertical flex should be a primary factor. Those things will affect your direct power output. Something like a Storck Scenero would be a good choice, because they manufacturer each frame size using proportionally larger components, which means that their frames have the same excellent ride quality from a 49cm frame to a 63cm. In addition, you need to focus on buying something with a strong set of wheels, or learn to ride smoothly. Or both. A set of Xentis wheels would be my choice, although that is far outside your budget, because they have the highest rated rider weight limit of any wheel I am aware of. (120Kg) While that is lower than your weight, it is better than the Mavic (100Kg) or Zipp (85Kg-100Kg) weight limits. And as always, there is a good safety margin built in to those limits. I hope that helps. Feel free to ask if you come up with any other questions. 

The wheel sensor add on will do quite a bit to improve the accuracy of the GPS based current speed. The distance will generally be accurate, to within error values of 50 meters, or so depending on hardware. Most phones, especially with android, are on the lower spec of GPS design, using wifi databases and cellular triangulation to augment the GPS positioning sensor. They generally use open source maps, like Google Maps, which often change, and are less than consistent about coverage. I would recommend using an ANT+ add on, if you are concerned about exact speed and distance. Wahoo makes decent ANT+ sensors for the iPhone, but I'm not aware of a quality set up for android. There are too many devices, so it would be difficult to create a single device guaranteed to work across the board on android, even with the same OS version. I assume this is why they haven't made an Android version yet. Hope that helps. 

This kind of failure is typically caused by excessive wear on the brake surface of the rim. Every time you apply your brakes, you are polishing small amounts of metal away from the rim. Eventually, the rim gets too thin and weak, and will crack, like you have seen in your photo, from the normal inflation pressure of the tire. In general, this means tht the rim has been used beyond its life. If it is a new, or lightly used rim, it may be a manufacturing defect. 

Yes, if your bike is stored for more than a few weeks, you should check it thoroughly before riding it. The tires will lose pressure, and the chain will need lube for certain, and depending on the length of storage, rubber components like brake pads, tires, and hydraulic seals may degrade. In addition, surface rust, and sometimes deeper corrosion can develop which would require a more complete service. 

A presta valve on some brands have removable valve cores. If the pump is good, and the tube is not punctured, then there are 2 more options:
