Worthy enough is a matter of opinion. It's probably worthy enough from your point of view. You feel you are worth more money, so you can ask for more. But from the employer's point of view, it's probably a bit more complex. Nobody is indispensable. Everyone can be replaced. If not you, they will find someone else. Companies don't have unlimited budgets for maintaining their website. At some point, you will be overpriced, and they may choose to find another way to get it done. Your challenge will be to request enough that the company is comfortable paying you, rather than going elsewhere. I worked for a small company that had a proprietary system which was maintained by one individual. He was confident that only he could do the work. Unfortunately, he had a heart attack and couldn't work any longer. The company went to a local university and hired an intern who taught herself how to handle the system at a fraction of the cost. It wasn't immediate, there were a few glitches along the way, but in the end she was far better than the original sysadmin. And she created enough documentation that it was never a one-person-system again. 

The only way your quitting would come out of nowhere is if you don't discuss your concerns with your manager. If you really don't want to leave a bad impression, you know what you should do. 

You might need to accept the fact that you need to work on your reaction to situations, rather than seeking to find a way to always be in complete control. The next time you can't convince someone to do things your way think "Ok. How am I reacting now? Does it really matter so much if I don't get my way here?" Think about this, and if you still don't see a way clear, you might wish to seek counselling. 

You have gone wrong by not asking your boss when you don't understand what to do, and when you don't know who to ask for help. Start with your boss! Next time your boss shows you some tables and asks you to copy one from one schema to another, ask "Sure thing, boss. Did you want me to copy one table or all of them in the schema?" Bingo - you've got the answer you need! The next time you are unsure what the best way to do copy a table, ask any of your peers "So in this shop, what is the best way to copy a table?" You've got the answer. But if you simply aren't sure you have the ability to do your job, you'll need to work closer with your boss. You'll need to admit the parts that confuse you, and ask what he/she would like you to do. You may need a mentor, you may need more training, or there may be something else needed. 

You should contact the new company right now, and correct the data. Offer to send an updated (and correct) resume. It's far better to find out the truth from you now, than have them discover it on their own and conclude that you were attempting to mislead them. Since you appear to be in the US, then yes, this could be grounds to rescind their offer (or fire you after you have started). If they like you, it probably won't cause them to change their mind. But you need to find out now. 

That depends on your personal ethics. Accepting an offer from a company who gave you the courtesy of at least one extension, with the intent that you would likely reject it later isn't something I would do. But perhaps you would. My thinking would be that if I could get one certain offer, and I felt good about my preferred company, I would be confident that I could reasonably soon get a job from someone (either preferred, or the next company). Thus I would thank that the company for their offer, but move on and not look back. Perhaps your situation, personal ethics, and self-confidence is different. 

Time to enhance your project management skills by changing your thinking. You seem to think that you must always have the most skilled person in each discipline exclusively work that task. That's simply not the case. Let's say he's the second best at UI design. If he takes up that task, that could free enough time from the individual who is best at UI design to handle another difficult task such as database design. Each task doesn't need to be handled solely be the one who is the best. Often the project is better overall when tasks are handled by someone who is "good enough". 

The best thing to say is always the truth. In this case you say "Yes" if asked if you were fired. And if the interviewer wants more details, you provide them. You should also be prepared to discuss how this new job will be different. 

Just as with any other call, you need to indicate if you cannot talk with the caller during work hours. Just say "I'm sorry, I can't talk with you during work hours. Can we chat after hours?" If the answer is "Yes" (as it would be for most good recruiters), then give her/him your home phone number and a good time for a call. Or, get the recruiter's phone number and call at a convenient time. If the answer is "No", then you can just say "I'm sorry to hear that. I guess we can't do business." Any decent recruiter will understand and work with you. Personally, I don't bother with recruiters who can't work within my constraints. There are plenty of other recruiters out there who can. 

Perhaps. But the market rate for new hires doesn't really track to inflation. Other factors (primarily the availability of people to fill these jobs, and the alternatives they have at their disposal) have a bigger impact on new hire salaries than the previous year's inflation rate. Consequently, new hires could command a salary higher than the inflation rate would imply, or less. But why do you care what new hires make anyway? You won't be a new hire, and after 10-20 years in the business, what they are making will not impact what you can make. 

As a hiring manager, I would consider 3 jobs in 3 years as job-hopping. It wouldn't matter if two of those hops were to the same company or not. But it might depend on what kind of job history you held before those 3 hops. You get to decide how much you care. And of course if you do go back but then stay for 10 years or so, the earlier hopping won't matter as much. 

In many situations, you won't know the actual salary until you go through at least part of the interview process. However, you can easily avoid wasting time on a position that doesn't fit your needs - just tell them your target salary. A simple "Sounds interesting! I'm not willing to consider any position that doesn't offer a salary of at least $X. Does this job fit?" would suffice. Recruiters, and hiring managers don't want to waste their time on a candidate that won't fit salary-wise. 

That depends mostly on the culture of your organization. In some companies, continuous change by everyone who reads such documents is welcome. In other companies, it would be considered rude without the author's permission. 

Clearly that's a decision you need to make on your own, based on your own beliefs on how to do your work well. 

Personally identifying yourself as solely tied in with a single technology is not a good idea in a rapidly-changing field like software development. It limits you too much, and eventually you will be left behind. 

Assuming you aren't soliciting their existing clients, I agree with your interpretation. Outside of any agreement, and outside of any information you haven't mentioned, I don't think your actions are unethical. Note that some states (such as California) won't allow you to use certain information from your former employer in your next job, even if you don't have a written agreement in place. You can, for example, be barred from revealing confidential information or trade secrets from your former employer, or from using certain information, such as your previous employer's confidential customer list, to solicit business. (see: calbar.ca.gov/Public/Pamphlets/Employee.aspx#16) 

If you simply send off a take-home exam and later receive the results, then the answer is you cannot know for sure that the test taker and the candidate who shows up in person are actually the same individual. There are organizations that will proctor a test for you, and check identification before the exam begins. If having someone else "take the test" is that much of a repeated problem for you, you might have to pay to have it solved or have folks take the test in your office, rather than remotely. Although I could imagine it happening, I haven't actually seen this as a real problem in my companies. But perhaps your context is different, perhaps you are hiring in volumes that make even a 15 minute phone screen prohibited, or perhaps other issues will get in the way. 

I don't agree with the advice you were given. I think it's rather odd to put the amount of credits earned on a resume or LinkedIn when you flunked out in less than a year. It calls attention to and highlights the fact that you didn't graduate. That said, I think it's perfectly reasonable to indicate a college you attended on LinkedIn - as long as you specifically don't include a graduation date or a degree (which you presumably didn't attain). I know of many folks who have done exactly that. During an interview, you may be asked "Why didn't you graduate?" So be prepared for that line of questioning. 

Yes! I have never worked at a job where I worked only on the few line items mentioned in the job description. I don't ever expect to do so. Virtually every job description either specifically mentions or implies "Other tasks as required". 

You might try letting the company know that you filed a case with the Labour Department. That might prompt them to start their process. Or not. 

Maybe. It's not automatic, but the new technology may be different enough from your current (1 year) experience, that you would be considered entry-level and only offered entry-level salary 

That depends on your role. If you are a contractor brought in to work on specific projects, then you put your head down, get your own work done, and ignore the company politics and the abilities of the people around you. That's what you were hired to do. On the other hand, if you were brought in to assess the company/department and make a recommendation (usually written), then you must include your assessment of the skills of the people. Sometimes that includes assessing individuals, but often you are being asked for an overall recommendation regarding how to make things better. In your case, you have indicated that you are being "paid for work, not to evaluate others", so I think your path is clear. As @s1lv3r states, sometimes that's the difference between a "contractor" and a "consultant". Basically, if you aren't being asked for your opinion, tread carefully. At least in my part of the world (the US software field), contractors who badmouth employees can ruin their reputation quickly. And if you still choose to convey your opinion regarding the lack of skill of one employee, you had better make sure that your own work is entirely perfect. This employee and his friends may very well want to retaliate and point out your imperfections. 

In general, it's always better if the responsible party owns up to an issue. In fact, it's rather snarky if someone else throws the responsible party under the bus. People are generally very forgiving, and owning up to a mistake is often the start of the road to forgiveness. Particularly if this error isn't a big deal, it will typically be quickly dismissed if dealt with quickly and honestly by the responsible party. Of course it depends on the culture of the organization, and the nature of the issue. In some situations it might be very important to associate the "error" with an individual. Many times, it's not a big deal. 

It would be foolish to accept a job offer for a position that you think is uninteresting, poor in terms of career growth, and generally not the best thing you could try. Look at it this way: if this was a job you were interviewing for, would you accept an offer? If not, then don't accept an offer just because you were an intern. Look elsewhere for a job that suits you. Start looking now. (And if you are truly disheartened, don't care anymore and could have been a better employee, then don't be surprised if your employer notices and you aren't offered a job there anyway.) 

Unless your contract states otherwise (very, very unlikely), then it isn't illegal to be passed over for a promotion. 

Basically, you just fold the activities you want to highlight into the normal activities you performed in your role. The second way is to highlight these activities in your cover letter. There you just describe what you did within a paragraph or two, and indicate how this will be valuable in the supervisory role you are seeking. 

It sounds like "checking personal email" is exactly what you are being told not to do. But if you aren't sure - ask. 

Unless you are working with a fee-based placement service (in which case he would be specifically working for you), a recruiter is always looking out for himself first. Typically, they are looking out for the company second and for you last - all in varying proportions. There's nothing about presenting you at a low salary that changes anything here. I've worked with a particular recruiter for years. He understands what I want, has been able to show me good candidates when I was hiring, and find me good positions when I wanted to be hired. That said, I always understood that he did his job primarily for his own benefit - that's as it should be. 

You may also want to ponder for a few minutes why your current role turned out differently than expected. Consider if there were questions you should have asked that would have made it more obvious that this wasn't what you desired. Think about how you will handle it differently in the future (ask different questions, ask potential peers and not just one interviewer, etc.) 

Be careful here. Inadvertently, you now have a "special relationship" with a job candidate. The significance of that may depend on local laws, your position within the company, the domain in which the company operates, the role being filled in relationship to you, etc. For example, if this new role reports to you either directly or indirectly, now or in the future, things might become very difficult. You may want to discuss this with HR (or the CEO if there is no HR) immediately. Hopefully, you at least recused yourself from the interviews. Imagine if something untoward happens after hiring this person and your relationship comes to light. Imagine if this person is rejected for the position and feels discriminated against because of you. Imagine if this person decides to retaliate by exposing your relationship. Imagine if this person decides to sue. Top management tends not to like being surprised. And this might be a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

In my experience, it's neither rude nor unprofessional to talk about a company with a friend. My good friends and I talk about companies where we have worked all the time. I'm happy to give a completely honest opinion and advice about any company where I have worked - both the good and the bad points. If your friend is reluctant, don't push it. Something there doesn't feel right to him, so don't make him uncomfortable by pressing. It's not clear what is behind his feeling, perhaps it was the way you asked the question, or perhaps he has only good feelings for his former employer. Perhaps he is worried that his response won't be kept confidential. Perhaps he doesn't know you well enough to divulge this information. Either way, he is entitled to his feelings. Perhaps another friend can provide the information you are seeking. 

Hmm. For software development, I'd challenge that assumption. In my experience, it's usually a lot cheaper to give people time off rather than extra pay. The exception is when you need to need to hire more people to back-fill for those having time off. In my shop, we typically give people informal comp time off when they are forced to work weekends. For us, that work isn't a regular occurrence. 

There's no benefit to you from informing Company B of where you will be employed. While it's unlikely to have any adverse affect either, there's a small possibility that someone at Company B will try to undermine your acceptance (call company A and say bad things about you, for example). I personally don't know a case where that has actually happened, but I've heard stories. There's probably nothing nefarious going on here. Company B probably just wants to stay in touch. But after you are happily settled in your new position, you could reach out and contact them if you choose, with no risk. For now, I think just letting Company B know you have accepted another offer, thanking them for their time, and wishing them continued success is the most prudent course of action. That's what I've always done in similar circumstances.
