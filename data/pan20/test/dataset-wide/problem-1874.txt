It's possible to establish a company policy that pays people for activities away from the office that are not billable but are required, such as the medical exam you mention in your question. There's no particular law or rule that demands companies do so. Any given company might choose to deem immigration paperwork as a valid use of company time, or as a personal matter that should dealt with on your own (personal or vacation) time. It's pretty easy to construct arguments either way. If your company has a policy, follow it. If they don't (and I assume you're asking because they don't) I would recommend not forcing the use of vacation for this. The employee will feel supported and will probably contribute back the time in happiness and increased productivity. To reduce the chance the other employees will be jealous, the employee should try to do other work while waiting if possible, should return to the office as soon as the process is done, and should not run other personal errands as part of the trip: in other words, treat it as a working day. 

Your understandably angry letter asks a number of questions of the company. I wonder what you would do with the answers. Do you actually want to know whether they value the time of applicants or not? There's a good chance they honestly do not - how will it help you to know that? If you don't want answers to your questions, perhaps you should figure out what you do want, and reword your letter or adjust your plan accordingly. It sure sounds like you want an apology, but you don't ask for one. A calmer version of this letter might get you an apology - but what good would that do you? Would that pay your rent, to show your landlord the apology letter from the people who wasted your time with their programming test? Might I suggest that an even better return on this process than an answer to rhetorical questions or an apology would be a lesson for yourself: a little more wisdom, a little more knowledge about the application process. One sentence jumps out at me from their letter: 

First, decide whether you really want to turn the work down or not. It might be enjoyable or give you skills that will help you to land the new job. If it's already landed, it might make you better at that job. Assuming you've given that a good thought and really don't want it, the good news is that it doesn't matter how you turn it down. You could be intensely rude, and you wouldn't be fired for it, and what the heck, you're leaving anyway. All that really matters is that you are polite. Do not give a reason: giving reasons only invite argument and questions. I suggest something like: 

If your boss wants to help you, and you're willing to work to minimize the crisis effect of you being suddenly gone, this can work out. If you knew, didn't plan, didn't ever alert the boss this day was coming, and have no flexibility to make it work, then chances are you and your brand new MBA will be looking for a job two months from now. That's not necessarily a bad thing, just be aware of it. 

As a manager, here is how I would want a staff member of mine to approach this. Use a tone that you am confiding in your boss, and that you are offering a solution to a problem the boss has. Say something like this: 

In all these cases once you give the manager information, such as "I can't start X until you provide me with Y, and if I don't start X today the project will be late", it is the manager's role to make a decision. To manage. Your best coping strategy is to focus on your work and being great at it. If you feel that your manager's incompetence is making that impossible, then looking for work inside or outside the company is your longer term strategy. You don't explain why you're ruling those out, but I'll accept that you are. When you have a choice between two impossible things (doing a good job under a bad manager, or getting a new job) then you will have to establish which is the more impossible of the two, and do the one you maybe have a chance to do. "Biting your tongue" is a terrible strategy born from the belief that you really should say something. Why should you? You've told people above you. If you're right, they'll know it. You might not be right. (The majority of people who believe their bosses are threatened by the brilliance and skills of their direct reports are not right about that. And even if you are, the "saying something" strategy isn't working - you've spoken up the chain and nothing happened.) So don't just "not say something", change your attitude to stop thinking that you should be saying something. 

Here is what I would tell your friend. Your resume is your document. You build it about yourself. You choose what goes on it in what order. It sounds like right now it reads something like this: 

You are paid a salary. Your company does that because it gets value from you. There are lots of ways you can provide value: 

You won't go wrong with telling the truth (just perhaps not too much of it) when you're in these situations. If your boss asks why you don't say hello to your coworker, you can say 

But in a way, that's a separate conversation, since it's not really about "hey boss, how do our reviews work anyway?" which appears to be your primary concern at the moment. 

What would you say? If the reason was personal, strongly held, supported by most of society, and not considered "weird" or extreme? Would you still say, in effect, "don't let the door hit you on the way out" or would you find a way to support that decision not to commute or travel more than a small distance? If you would say it's a condition of employment, there's no-one else to send, and if I need to hire someone else who will do it, I can only do so by parting with this employee, then say that. Don't let the bike thing confuse you. If you would find a way for a "good" reason then stop judging reasons and find a way. Not asking other people to do more work for less money, or do all the travel while being rewarded the same as the nontraveller, but a real true fair way to support this very firmly held desire. I don't think you need to involve the biker in that process much, unless someone says "I will do all the travel if the biker does all the X" and you need to see if the biker is cool with that. This could be a very powerful retention strategy for a valued employee, since the chance of finding another employer who could accommodate this belief system may be slim. And all the other staff will see that you are flexible and generous, which is generally a good thing to be seen to be. Note: I am not suggesting that caring for a family member, whether newborn, aged, or ill, is comparable to the bike preference. If you would fire the employee even if this dispute involved a clearly "good" reason then go ahead and fire them over this. It's not about the bike, it's that travel is a condition of employment. That half of the advice is easy. The second half is harder. If you would find a way to make it work, a real true fair way, not just asking others to do the person's work for nothing, then there is a way to make it work. So even for this reason, why not do it? Why not be fair? As for the biker giving you the cold shoulder, very shortly either the biker will be gone or you will be delivering the news that "you win, you don't have to travel far any more" and either way your cold shoulder problem should stop. 

This is far more than "only say the finishing year." This is moving the thing you don't want to spend the whole interview discussing down to a less important area and emphasizing what you do want to discuss. Build a resume that presents you the way you want to be presented. Then practice one or two sentences to answer the question of why it took so long. In this case it sounds like: 

But in the overall scheme of things, if your main workplace problem is a little too much thankyou from your boss, like could be a lot worse. 

As an interviewer, I face a number of challenges. If I just ask you about coding, I can rule out people who really don't know what they're talking about, but I might accidentally hire someone who "talks a good game" but writes horrible code - hard to read, insecure, bug-ridden, inefficient - or who is very slow, or who is rude to co-workers, or much more. So I ask you questions that aren't just about code, in the hopes I can learn enough about you to avoid a bad hire, but that isn't always enough either. Some companies set coding problems in the interview, either on a whiteboard or at a computer. These are really expensive for the company because they add 30 or 60 minutes to the interview in many cases. A good programmer might do a bad job at these (so we recommend practicing for them) and a bad interviewer might misinterpret what happens during them. As a result some companies think they will save money and time by giving you a sort of "take home test". They don't typically ask you to write something they want to sell, it's a way to see what you can do. Often it's a problem that was solved already so they can compare your solution to someone else's. There's still the risk that someone might help you do it, or you might spend far longer on it than you say, but they see it as a cheaper way to screen people. If you want the job, you'll invest the time in being screened, and if it's not worth it to do that, just decline the opportunity. This happens in other industries: cooks are sometimes asked to work unpaid in the kitchen for a day so their speed and technique can be evaluated, artists are asked to bring a portfolio which often includes works they created without being paid to do so, performers must audition - give an unpaid performance - and often spend time learning music, lines, or steps in order to do so, and so on. I have heard people suggest that somehow they are not so much interviewing as doing free project work. That companies are asking for a day or two of work, then when it's submitted asking for another day or two of work, all while dangling a job offer in front of them. If this is happening to you, one of two situations exist:
