Unfortunately, what you describe is not at all uncommon. If a "Knowledge Transfer" covers 30% of the job, that's pretty awesome. The most important thing to do is identify other people in the area/department who are also versed in whatever you're doing. 

Yes, chat tends to be must less formal then even email. I used to try to be correct, but, really, it's just not worth time. 

You can address the "unprofessional" comment by essentially conspiring with your manager to have them close the door. Meaning, you manager can swing by a couple of times for whatever reason, then on the way out ask "open or closed?". The three of you say "closed". Manager, hearing the clear majority says "no problem, thanks for the...whatever..." then closes the door. 

It depends greatly on who is taking the most initiative in the deal or who want's the deal the most. For example, if Contoso needs a new widget supplier and they think Fabrikam makes the best widgets in the world and really wants them, Contoso will pay to send their personnel to Fabrikam to inspect the factory and negotiate a deal. But, if Fabrikam is trying to sell Contoso their amazing widgets and get them to switch suppliers, then Fabrikam will invite at their (Fabrikam's) expense Contoso personnel to inspect the factory and discuss a deal. In other words, whoever has the most initiative usually pays. 

The main purpose is to avoid wasting both the candidate's and the company's time if the candidate would not accept an offer at a certain level. If the position is for 60k, and the candidate's lifestyle demands 80k, it's better to know that up front than to go through the whole interview process only to find this out in the end. It's a pre-filter. EDIT: Of course, that's the good, or benign reasons they might ask you that question. The bad, or malevolent reason would be to get you to commit to a lower salary than they are willing to pay. 

Write kick-ass code. If you do an awesome job coding, then there will be fewer fires to put out, and it will make everybody's life easier. When it does, you may need to do a bit of self-promotion in demonstrating how what you did helped. Metrics may be your friend here. If you still encounter resentment even after you have demonstrated how your work is making their jobs easier, then you're probably in a toxic environment and have another set of issues. 

The usual social sanction for a joke that falls flat is lack of laughter or silence. Hopefully, this would be sufficient not to try it again. If the pattern continues, you can tell him you'd prefer he not joke about your height. Of course, for a certain class of folks, this would be an invitation for a steady stream of jokes about your size. Your description makes him sound like he's more clueless/ignorant/insensitive than sadistic, so he may respond well to the feedback, but you would know better than I would. 

You're being too sensitive. If someone wants to break into the employee records, someone's password is not the vector they would choose. And if they do try, there is a near 100% chance someone's administrative password is far less 'secure' than anything you would choose. If it's a 'large company', their internal security personnel, auditors and lawyers are probably aware of this and are ok with it. A 'large company' is not going to change their policy over this, sorry :( 

My opinion, you're overthinking this. Breaks in monotony are work time just as much as typing in the editor. It's part of the creative process. So, chatting with teammates, getting a snack, checking SO while waiting for a build to complete just come with the territory. The situation is the same for ancillary distractions such as random phone calls and such. No one stops the clock for two minutes to answer a call from their mother. Over time, you'll develop a professional sense of what a work-break (billable) vs. a break in work (not billable). Yes, this is different then task based work, such as answering phones or data entry. Also keep in mind that tracking such trivial 'breaks' can take as much time as the breaks themselves. Finally, this is an impossible thing to judge. Some very productive people don't appear to do much work while some other work hard for relative average output. Lunch is a grey area. If you billing as an FTE, then the daily rate may include that but generally, you don't bill the hour you take for lunch just as you would bill any time taken for doing random errands during the day. 

I would say that once you have established yourself in your career (with a few notable exceptions) where you went to college will not count against you. On the other side, I was lucky to have attended a college with a good reputation, that have had several alumni in decision-making positions in the town in which it was situated. It would not be completely honest of me to claim that having the name of the university on my resume didn't mean it got a more generous look than it would have otherwise, and that this never meant the difference between me getting past a certain level of screening and not. I have even been told before an interview that a manager likes graduates of my school. It really shouldn't matter, and I really would like to be able to say that it doesn't matter. But that's not entirely how the world works with human beings. A hiring manager is more likely to trust someone from his alma mater or a similar school than one that he doesn't know. 

In my experience, what these types of request typically mean is that management has already decided on certain cuts, and is using the suggestion scheme to provide some cover. Then people will make suggestions that don't impact them. Non coffee drinkers will suggest getting rid of coffee. Single people will suggest cutting family health benefits. Whatever cuts management had in mind, chances are someone will suggest it. Management can then implement the cuts as the result of ideas coming from the front lines rather than imposed from above. I'm not saying that's what you're doing, but how this action is likely to be received. 

You need to remember what the drawings are for. Yes, a picture can be worth a thousand words, but it can also add nothing. A Venn diagram may communicate something, though not much added value, yet there is no added value at all in drawing a picture of a python after saying you can code. If anything it's confusing. 

Have a look at sites like $URL$ There are a lot of resources out there aimed at making it fun to learn to code. Try to find one close to the skills you're using at work and build it from there. Once you've built up some confidence with a technology, come up with a little side product for you to work on at home. Don't choose anything too ambitious, and then use Stack Overflow for specific questions and issues with your project. You'll start to feel more confident in tackling the programming books too after a while. On the other hand, if you try the above and are still feeling like you don't enjoy it, there is nothing wrong with a move to testing. It's a very valid career path, not too badly paid and you are likely to still have chances to dabble in coding if you feel like it. 

I would say "Full Stack Web & App Developer" because just Full Stack + mobile would still read as just Web to me personally. App development tends to be called out separately. If I just saw "mobile", I'd think responsive websites etc. 

Assuming these are all legitimate mistakes that are the fault of the employees and not the process, a system of peer accountability seems be in order. If you have a regular meeting with the employees to review tickets (e.g. projecting them on the whiteboard), and point out if they have not been updated in a regular enough time. If you have regular stand-up meetings, where the root cause of a problem repeatedly comes down to a certain developer forgetting a semicolon, that should be embarrassing to the programmer and provide the incentive him to change. I don't like meetings anymore than anyone else, but making the team members accountable to each other for results and their performance in following through with certain things will in most cases make them more likely to do it. 

Disclaimer: I am the type of person who will take public transportation even when told explicitly that taking a cab is acceptable because I tend to be frugal and sort of enjoy the sense of adventure. This is probably not the norm. From my perspective, this is what I would conclude from each of the items, if I got word a candidate had submitted those expenses: 

See above, and my disclaimer -- I have never ordered room service in my life, regardless of who's paying, since I am viscerally offended at the idea of paying $18 for scrambled eggs. But this may not be the norm. -- I'd say the biggest variable is how your actual interview went. If you did well, then people probably won't be looking for reasons to knock you down. If you did poorly or fair, then submitting questionable expenses could make you the butt of water cooler jokes at the company for the next several years. Remember that guy who couldn't even code fizzbuzz, then expected us to pay for his room service and airport lounge and a replacement for the bus ticket he lost?
