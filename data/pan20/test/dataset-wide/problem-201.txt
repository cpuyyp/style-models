The Latin root for "moon" would be lun(a)- (lunars, lunites). The Greek root would be selen(e)- (selenites, selenians, selenes). The Sanskrit would be chandr(a)- (chandrans?). Or, pick a language spoken where these people were first discovered, and build off the word for "moon" in that language. 

It's possible, with some changes to history. The biggest obstacle in making a compound bow is the cam system. Simply put, there are a lot of things that can go wrong with it. It took until 2005 for someone to design a twin-cam system that wouldn't need frequent tuning, for instance. There was nothing in this design which couldn't have been invented by Leonardo da Vinci; there just wasn't much of any experimentation with pulley-based bow systems until the 20th century. However, in a world where clockwork was used significantly earlier, leading to the development of more mechanical weapons, it's not inconceivable that the idea could have arisen around the Renaissance. (Consider the Antikythera mechanism: a clockwork device with differential gears, from the second or third century BC. If that sort of technology had been more widespread, clockwork might have become prominent significantly before Renaissance times.) Without the cam system, there's not really a point in having detachable limbs. The strength of a non-compound bow comes from the bow itself acting as a spring; finding a way to make the limbs detachable, while keeping the entire bow sufficiently springy and not breaking under stress, is not trivial. If your dwarves are able to work aluminum, which is a notoriously difficult metal, the materials themselves are less of an issue. You may not be able to make wood as strong and light as fiberglass, but it can certainly be stronger and stiffer than is conventional for a longbow. Or even hollow metal components might be used as a substitute. 

Hydrofluoric acid This is a magical answer, as I can't think of any natural way for a human-like creature to use HF. Hydrofluoric acid is a nasty chemical in many ways. It's a precursor to all sorts of fluorine-containing chemicals, but it's difficult to store (it'll eat through glass), and it's extremely dangerous to humans. If it comes in contact with eyes, skin, or lungs, it causes horrible burns. But worst of all, these burns are painless and initially not even visible. Because HF penetrates right through the skin and starts bonding with calcium ions. These ions are crucial for nerve function, and without them the nerves aren't able to send pain signals. Hence many people who are exposed don't seek treatment until it's too late. (Treatment usually involves replenishing the calcium ions and giving the HF something else to bond to, something that's not important for nerve functions.) So if your elves somehow have HF in their saliva, without it affecting their own bodies (hence the magic), it could be used to prevent pain before they tear someone apart. The damage is permanent and often fatal if it spreads far enough, but I'm guessing the elves don't care about that. 

The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov This is one of the most complete examples of "different physical laws" I've seen. In the book's parallel universe, the strong force is significantly more powerful than in ours; this means that solid matter can interpenetrate, and life has evolved to take advantage of this. Stars are also smaller and shorter-lived, which is what drives the main plot of the book: the inhabitants of the parallel universe are seeking an alternate source of energy for when their star dies. They end up trading matter back and forth with our own universe, using the difference in the laws to gain energy on both sides: stable isotopes in our universe are radioactive in theirs, and vice-versa, so they can be made to decay back and forth. 

I'm creating a fictional hyperspace to enable FTL travel. It's sort of a mix of Star Wars, Star Trek, Halo, and probably a bunch of other stuff. I've run into an aspect of it that either requires some handwaving or a bit of math that's beyond my understanding. It goes something like this, please bear with me: Hyperspace is perpendicular to our normal spacetime. As you go "deeper" into hyperspace, coordinates get compressed. Imagine our spacetime represented as a square plane and hyperspace as an inverted pyramid below it (or a disc and a cone, if you like). Since all points eventually converge at the "bottom", if you can go down into hyperspace and travel a bit, when you come back out you will have moved father than normal and faster than light (effectively). This compression occurs in smooth gradients, not distinct layers like subspace in Star Trek. Like Star Trek though, you need a field that creates a bubble around your ship. This makes an area of normal spacetime that protects your ship. Then you can push into hyperspace with this bubble and manipulate the shape of the bubble to move around in hyperspace. Hyperspace wants to push you out (or keep you out), and gravity wells magnify this effect. So you need enough energy to stay in and you need to plot a course that avoids gravity wells. I'm not asking about the energy requirements though, because I have a fictional power generator that we don't worry too much about. Since you naturally pop out of hyperspace near gravity wells (or even if your drive fails), the main dangers with this drive system, in my mind, seem to be regarding the field that makes the bubble. Anything contained within the bubble goes into hyperspace, which allows for stuff getting cut in pieces, like what happens in Halo 2 when the Covenant ship jumps while it's still over the city (It brings chunks of buildings with it into deep space). The field that makes this bubble in my fictional universe can vary in strength from nothing (off) to a level that allows for the transition to hyperspace, then beyond, until you don't have enough energy to go any deeper into hyperspace. I think that these bubbles repel each other (kind of like magnets), such that two ships in hyperspace would not collide. I also think there must be a gradient of some kind between normal spacetime and hyperspace, however slim, at the edge of the bubble. Given all that, my questions are: 

I know this isn't hard SF by a long shot, but I like it when the answers at least seem to be based on what we know about physics. I also know that's a bunch of questions rolled into one long post, so I appreciate any help you can give. 

What might happen to matter at the inside and outside surfaces of the bubble at the moment of transition? Could there be dangerous effects even before the transition to hyperspace, as the field strength is increasing? What might happen to propellant expelled/ignited if the ship fired its conventional engines while inside the bubble (or any other matter contacting the bubble, really)? Might there be any dangerous radiation inside or outside the bubble, especially due to any matter caught in the transition? Does it make sense that the bubbles would repel each other (does it seem internally consistent)? What visual effects might there be to an outside and/or inside observer (especially during transition)? Any other potential dangers from creating or collapsing this bubble? 

First, a physics note. If you compress or expand something in this way, its linear momentum and kinetic energy won't change (as you've rightly gathered). But the moment of inertia depends on how spread out the mass is. So if a spinning object is expanded, it will spin slower; if it's compressed, it will spin faster. The classic demo of this is a twirling figure-skater, who speeds up when she pulls her arms close to her body. This could violate conservation of energy depending on how much energy it takes to compress things; if spinning objects "resist" being compressed (and thus take more energy), conservation won't be a problem. For non-combat uses, the scientific potential is tremendous. Forget microscopes: just scale up your samples until you can see the details you want. Want a more powerful phone? Take a high-end processor and scale it down. Depending how far this expansion and compression can go, the possibilities are endless! But of course, the military would probably get their hands on it first. As far as combat usage, your metal slab could be enormously effective, but also enormously difficult to use. Let's say the slab is one centimeter thick. Wolfram|Alpha says that steel alloy is about 7.859 g/cmÂ³; your 19x5x0.01 slab would weigh almost 7.5 metric tons. The heaviest .50 BMG bullet I can find is only 52 grams. So your railgun will need quite a lot of power to even push it out the barrel. It would probably be more effective to fire a larger object at the beginning: a cannonball, for instance. Use a proper artillery cannon to get it moving. Then compress it into a bullet in midair. It'll still have all the kinetic energy of a flying cannonball, but now that energy is focused on an area smaller than a quarter; that will tear through pretty much anything. If your enemies return fire, you'll want to do the opposite. Bullets hurt because they're so small, so their force is focused onto a small area. Scale them up a few orders of magnitude, and you're effectively being hit with a styrofoam ball; it might leave a bruise if it's moving fast enough, but it won't kill you. (Plus, as John pointed out, air resistance will stop it dead fairly quickly.) Confirming this experimentally is left as an exercise for the reader. 

Mental illness such as schizophrenia is diagnosed based on symptoms. If something is causing symptoms truly identical to schizophrenia, it's going to be very difficult to figure out that the underlying cause is different. So something will have to be different. One possibility is that the symptoms are different in some subtle way. For instance, the most famous symptom of schizophrenia is hallucinations. But these hallucinations are usually auditory (hearing things that aren't there), less often visual (seeing things) or tactile (feeling sensations that aren't there, like bugs crawling on your skin). They almost never manifest as smells or tastes. Perhaps demonic possession tends to include hallucinating the smell of brimstone or a bitter taste, along with its other effects. Another possibility is that the underlying cause of demonic possession is easier to test for. Someone who's possessed might react to the touch of holy water or consecrated Host even while unconscious, which a schizophrenic wouldn't, even if they believed they were possessed or had a paranoia of Catholicism.
