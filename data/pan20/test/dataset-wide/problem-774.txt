We observe the temperature of the CMB as a ~2.7 K blackbody, but that's the redshifted version we observe. The CMB is also know as the "surface of last scattering" at the point of recombination when nuclei and electrons combined to form neutral atoms the universe went from opaque to transparent. This happens at a temperature of ~3000 K. From this we can estimate the redshift (z~1100) of the CMB which corresponds to an age given our cosmology. 

When stars transition from the main sequence core Hydrogen burning to core Helium burning they can experience Hydrogen shell burning. 

Aladin is a good way to do visualization from multiple catalogs. MAST also offers a cross-mission search. 

With the Tully Fisher relation, the inclination angle is determined from the major-minor axis ratio where $sin(i) = \sqrt{1-q^2} $ and q is the inverse of your ratio. You need to apply the sine of the angle to the rotational velocity because the measure is based on our line of sight observation which must be converted to the true 3D velocity. 

Since basically all metals come from some stellar process, the question of elemental distribution can vary greatly between different environments depending on when you're observing that particular galaxy, star/galaxy cluster, etc. Galaxy mergers, supernova, and stellar winds can be particularly good at moving metals around a galaxy or galaxy cluster. Interestingly Wolfram has element data with Universe abundances but I'm not sure where they derive those. 

Tilt is the angle between the earth's rotation axis, and its orbital plane around the sun. Precession is the phenomenon whereby the direction of the tilt changes, which is why Polaris won't always be the pole star (until it comes round again). The amount of the tilt also varies, but only by a few degrees. 

The magnification is given by (focal length of telescope)/(focal length of eyepiece). The spec I saw said the telescope focal length is 800mm, and the maximum magnification is 160x, so to get that would need a 5mm eyepiece. Barlow lenses have the effect of increasing the telescope focal length: the 2x barlow would therefore give an effective focal length of 1600mm, and using the 9.7 mm eyepiece would give magnification of 160 (approx). However be aware that the occasions when 160 magnification gives really clear views will be quite rare, as it is at the limit of what an 80mm scope can achieve. The rule of thumb for maximum useful magnification for a good scope is 50x the diameter of the objective lens (in inches). 

The declination limit, looking south, is about -52 degrees. This is basically your latitude minus 90. At 8pm, due south will be about RA 12hrs, and at 3 am it will be about 19hrs. The eastern horizon will be about 6 hrs ahead, and that increases as you look further north, until you hit the circumpolar region, when all RAs are visible. 

Take another photograph of the same field that is less exposed. (Doesn't matter if you do this by shortening the exposure time, decreasing the ISO, etc.) This will give you an image with far fewer stars so you can easily pattern match your images. 

For starbursts, their star formation rates are best estimated by a combination of their ultraviolet and infrared emission. [O II] and [O III] as well as Hydrogen recombination lines can be used to estimate star formation, but like the UV, these suffer from extinction. 

Vizier is a good resource for finding catalogs. Searching for "SMC+cepheid" I found a related paper (Udalski et al. 1999) with additional data $URL$ You can also look for "Similar Catalogs" though it may or may not be useful in this case. 

A high density of stars definitely increases the chances of collisions, however, the high velocity of a halo star orbiting wouldn't increase its chances. Since the halo star is traveling very quickly, the halo star would only spend a small amount of time near the galactic core. Additionally, it would have less time to get deflected, gravitationally, by other stars in the core. 

Leo starts to rise at about midnight, local time, so you should be fine, weather permitting. Note also that you may be able to see meteors even before then, as Leo is merely that part of the sky from which the meteors appear to originate, but you will likely be able to see them some distance away from Leo. I don't know where the Google rise time comes from. EDIT; the link you added shows Leo rising at about midnight, confirming that the google source is incorrect, or not being correctly interpreted. 

In Miami, Polaris will be approx 25 degrees above the horizon, not 65. Height above the horizon is equal to the latitude of the observer. At the North Pole, Polaris is very nearly directly overhead, all the time, because the Earth's axis of rotation points very nearly towards it. Due to precession, Polaris will not always be so close to where the Earth's axis points. 

I don't know when it was first hypothesised that the planets were different from the stars. Given that stars twinkle, and planets don't (at least not so much), it could well have been in classical times. However the first proof would have come with the use of telescopes to look at the sky, so around about Galileo's time. This would have given proof because the planets would resolve into disks, and the bands of Jupiter were noted almost immediately. Stars however remained pointlike irrespective of magnification applied. Also telescopes would have shown that that Mercury & Venus, and to a lesser extent Mars exhibit phases, like the moon. There is a further point as to when it was realised that the stars and the sun were the same type of object. Again I don't know when this was first hypothesised, but fairly compelling evidence would have come with the advent of stellar spectrometry, which I think was was mid 19th Century. This is because the stars would show similar patterns of absorption lines as the sun. 

However, when you burn the Hydrogen in the shell to Helium, it will fall on the core creating a hotter core where the radiation pressure from the Helium burning core will push the Hydrogen further out into the outer envelope. From here you can get a Helium flash which is the cause of Horizontal Branch stars. If you were able to somehow force more Hydrogen to shell burn then you could possibly extend the life for a short while, though the lifetimes post main sequence are much shorter < 1 Gyr compared to the lifetimes on the main sequence. 

Asphalt roads do a great job at heating up cities! Mars can actually get up to 80F, so part of the challenge is preventing losing that heat in the low pressure atmosphere. 

The Van Allen radiation belt, which is outside of the Earth's magnetic field is believed to get its radiation from solar wind. 

HUDF suffers from cosmic variance. So while you could choose what you believe is a random and unbiased region of sky, your uncertainty will be larger than just the standard statistical sampling error. There would be additional uncertainty because of large scale structure since galaxies are not randomly distributed on the sky. 

Newly found solar systems will be associated with stars. There is a well defined system of coordinates for stars (and other celestial objects). Stars, other than the sun, are so far away that their coordinates change only a very small amount from year to year, and so it is easy to locate them. 

To get good views of Jupiter and Saturn you need quite high magnification - probably 100 times or more. The XT8 has a focal length of 1200 mm and so to get that magnification will need an eyepiece of 12 mm focal length. I believe the scope comes with a 10mm eyepiece which will give 120 times magnification, which should give decent views. You could go for higher magnification with shorter focal length eyepieces, but if you do you will find that the object you are observing scoots across the field of view rather quickly and you will spend more time moving the telescope than actually observing. As you get more experienced you may find you get more adept at moving the scope, and so could use more magnification. Itâ€™s important that the mirrors of the scope are properly aligned (collimated) so as to get the sharpest views. The manual should tell you how to do that. 

I believe your confusion is from combining two popular simplifications of our Universe. As we look further away we see further back in time because of the finite speed of light. So these distant objects are also evolving with us, but that light hasn't hit Earth yet. It might help to know that the observable universe may only be 14 Gyr old, but its radius is 46 Gly, not 14 Gly. If the speed of light was infinite, then we wouldn't be observing back in time as we look at more distant objects. 

You're right, a redshift will give you a measure of a velocity, not an acceleration. I'm assuming when you say acceleration, you're referring to the accelerating expansion of the universe so you're not looking at the particular acceleration of an object (which you could get from examining the force of gravity imparted on that object). So in addition to a redshift, you need to find a way to independently measure the distance. To get out to an appreciable redshift (z~0.5), Type Ia supernova are used as "standard candles". They are considered standard because they're believed to be from white dwarfs that explode because they have reached their maximum possible mass, the Chandrasekhar limit, of 1.4 solar masses. Therefore, when they explode, they should all look about the same and any difference in brightness would be from how far they are away from us. So they measured the distance and the redshift of the galaxy the supernova originated from to determine the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating over time. 

Your description matches that of a fireball, which are typically large meteors. As they enter the atmosphere they heat up and glow. The colour will depend on their speed and composition. As they get hotter, they often break up into several pieces, which follow the same trajectory. Much the same effect arise when old satellites or space debris re-enters the atmosphere. 

The 4, 24 and 30mm eyepieces give different magnification (equal to the the focal length of the telescope in mm, divided by the number for the eyepiece). You can use eyepieces from other brands, but make sure they have the same size barrel (the bit that slides into the telescope). I don't know the Gskyer brand, but the eyepiece size will be either .965 inch or 1.25 inch. Provided you get the same size, any other brand will work. It's probably best to get familiar with what is provided by Gskyer before buying anything else. You will likely find that using lower magnification at first gives the best outcome. 

The alignment should be maintained. In general, at the equinoxes, the sun rises due east and sets due west. As East and West are determined relative to the Earth's axis of rotation, it doesn't matter that the direction of the axis changes due to precession. As an example, Stonehenge is aligned to the midsummer sunrise (OK, not the equinox, but it makes the point), and has been for 4000 years (I haven't checked when the relevant part is thought to have been built). 

This is a spectral energy distribution (SED). Since astronomical objects don't emit light a single frequency an SED tells you how much emission you're getting across a range of frequencies. 

To get an order of magnitude estimate you can just use the total mass $M$ and luminosity $L$ of the star and an assumption of your fusion process. Main sequence stars fuse Hydrogen in to Helium through the proton-proton chain, which converts 0.7% of mass into energy. So the estimated lifetime of the star would just be: $0.007\frac{Mc^2}{L}$ ($c$ is the speed of light). For example, the sun would have a lifetime ~$10^{11}$ years, but that's assuming that all Hydrogen is being converted to Helium via the proton-proton chain. Given the scaling from observations of the Sun, you can use the mass-luminosity relation to estimate lifetimes for other main sequence stars. 

For each template you can figure out the expected luminosity in the I-band and find the best match. For this method, it's really best to have more than one point for comparison. Since the near IR will likely be a blackbody from your evolved stellar population, you might want to see if you can supplement your I-band data with 2MASS observations. 

If you take a line from the middle of the terminator, but at 90 degrees to the termination, it more or less points towards the sun. Now consider the moon at first quarter: as the moon rises, the sun is due south, so imagine a line from the moon to the sun, and the terminator will be at 90 degrees to this, so pointing from bottom right to top left. At mid-day, the sun is in the west, and the terminator will be sloping bottom left to top right. 

The sun will still be very very bright and I advise you not to look at at directly. If you were to, you would not see any corona, since it is very faint, relative to the sun (even 1%). The sun will look a bit like your photo, but I'd say with a little more light. However there will be a very noticeable darkening of the environment around you, to the extent that any local wildlife will likely start make preparations for nighttime. It will also cool down. As totality approaches, gaps between shadows made by, for example leaves on trees, will progressively show the shape of the partially obscured sun - similarly with pinhole cameras. 

Black holes are created because the core of the star becomes very dense, not just because the star is massive. Prior to the creation of the black hole, the core is able to create enough outward pressure to prevent the core from gravitationally collapsing to the density needing to create a black hole. 

The local environment is very important to star formation because it requires material as well as something to perturb the nebula to start collapsing and forming star(s). Therefore, both the type of galaxy as well as the location in the galaxy are very important to creating stars. However, once a star moves from protostar onto the main sequence, external influences don't much affect its development. This is how we can identify stellar streams because the stars come from a similar population when they are created, but some tidal forces cause them to spread out around the galaxy. 

The mass luminosity relation is non-linear (L = M^3.5 for the main sequence) so more massive stars burn at a much faster rate. This is a non-linear relationship because the fusion is caused by pressure in the core from the star trying to gravitationally collapse on itself.
