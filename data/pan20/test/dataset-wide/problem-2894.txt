Consciousness is an illusion To put it simply and to answer your direct question. Consciousness is an illusion onto itself. The illusion is of a very clear picture of a "never ending" story we call life, but in reality Consciousness is fragmented and can and does misinterpret (to put it plainly) Reality. To give a few examples anecdotal examples every time you go to sleep, There is a break in your Consciousness, and every time you hear a noise that isn't there or mistake a word for something else or misinterpret an optical illusion you brain feeds your consciousness a wrong answer that you would swear is true. 

Jean-Paul Sartre had a very strict view when it came to this. As an existential Philosopher he laid a lot of the ground work when it came to how many view the world. He says "life has no meaning" he thinks that its up to us to make our own. Also its important to look into Kierkegaard to get a better understanding of where Sartre's views on existentialism come from to get a better understanding of his perspective and thus his role in it. Modern Philosophers Before I go talk about modern Philosophers its hard not to remind you to look at how David Hume's teachings of Empiricism influence how philosophers today think. A large portion of philosophers today will link back to Hume's teachings as a reason they think how they do on the topic, like Massimo Piglucci. However in the interest of keeping this answer short I leave you with John Cottingham a modern Philosopher who does a lot of work on the topic. 

Well you ask the question: "How does philosophy treat the possibility of the omnipotence making all possible religion basis unable to be determined on their truthfulness?" and the short answer is there isn't a clear answer simply because there is no consensuses on the topic throughout philosophy. That being said When you look at it from an empiricist perspective you have to take a look at the claims that that religion makes and find examples of that in nature. If everything adds up than as far as empiricism is concerned than that religion is True. However most Empiricist including David Hume (who is basically the patron for Empiricism in the Empiricist vs Rationalist debate) employ a certain level of skepticism for every claim you make you have to put effort into disproving to find if it holds up. And to answer your root question it comes down it depends on if the religion made any claims to truth that it hinges on, then yes it can be discussed on the basis of that truth if not than no. Now things do get a little complex when you start entering into the territory of well because the god or gods are all powerful they can change the status of that truth you cant argue that point with the same approach and discussing that quickly becomes fruitless. At that point the discussion has to shift into the discussion of How we determine what is true In witch i would direct you back to the empiricist v.s rationalist argument. 

Your first example is incorrect because the negation distributes across the conjunction by way of De Morgan's Law. Therefore, the "AND" symbol needs to become an "OR," but otherwise, it is correct. Your second example is correct as is. 

Honestly, this should probably be moved to Math.SE, but since it's here, I might as well answer it. If what you are really talking about is sampling a probability distribution, then the answer is "no." If there is a finite probability to achieve success in any given trial, then success will be achieved infinitely often during infinite trials. On the other hand, if you are willing to consider a Markov Chain (or other random process), then the answer is "yes." A sequential random process (like a Markov Chain) is an ordered series of states. Often, a state is "persistent" meaning that it is returned to infinitely often in a never-ending trial. However, sometimes there are states known as "transient" which are exactly opposite - they are returned to a finite number of times during a never-ending trial despite having finitely measurable transition probabilities (i.e. the likelihoods of going into or out of that state are not infinitesimal). Constructing a Markov Chain that has a transient state labeled "success" is a trivial matter. However, reducing the number of successes from "finite" to "one" is probably impossible if you want to both play fair (i.e. not just construct the trivial state space) and also not have to rely entirely on luck (i.e. be able to get one success consistently during infinite trials). 

Kant's Categorical Imperative relies on what is logically possible. Even if we take your position that it is only okay to lie to a murderer (and not at any other time), Kant can still construct a logical contradiction. Namely: Assume everyone lies to murderers. Therefore, everyone would know that anything said to a murderer is false. As a result, the information that one might wish to conceal by lying is laid bare because it is simply the opposite of what was said. Therefore, your statement is no longer a lie since the conveyed meaning of the statement within its linguistic and social context is in fact a truth. This is a contradiction because we assumed that the statement was a lie. At this point, your more subtle argument comes into play. "There are many ways to lie," you might say, "Therfore, there is no way to discern the truth merely from the knowledge that the statement is untrue." This is analogous to your position that motivations are complex and that context matters. Maybe it can be okay to lie in some situations (or to some questions) but not in others. The answer to this criticism is that not every situation that is willed universally must create a logical contradiction. As long as any do (such as being asked a strictly yes-or-no question by the murderer), then it is disallowed. Therfore, it is not a straw man fallacy because it is more nuanced and flexible then you are giving it credit for. It was actually designed to accept different situations or different contextual details as parameters. The upshot is that lying is pretty much never allowed under Kant's arguments, but other things (such as killing another human being) can sometimes slip through depending on the context. Although, off the top of my head, I can't think of a good example where the CI would allow for murder. 

Frank, you made a good observation about the similarities between traditional qualia and the flow of time. As I understand it, anything that we experience has all of the necessary properties of a quale. Since we experience the flow of time, surely we can find things that are similar in this experience to other quale, surely with it the problems that come up in discussions of other quale. Before I look into other similarities, let's first look at traditional quale, like color or taste. When I talk about the flavor of onions, it's difficult, maybe even impossible (for now, at least), to determine if that sensation is exactly the same as yours. And when I say blue, perhaps you're actually thinking of what I think of as red. As of yet, science hasn't given us the tools to compare these things. Personally, I think of this as the property of qualia that give them any weight, or philosophical meaning. If we could compare color, then who would about the quale of color, then, right? Sure, they'd still be experience just the same, but when I hear qualia I immediately think of the subjective, incomparable nature of experience. If we could compare things, calling them qualia would seem inappropriate. I almost define qualia as our experience that we can't compare. If we take this definition, then the ability to compare colors would exclude them from the class of things that are qualia. Anyway, back to time. When we the experience of time, it seems the only properties we could disagree on are the direction of flow and the rate of flow. Physics (in particular, thermodynamics and its irreversible processes) gives us reasons to think that time couldn't flow backwards. If you accept this as true (I don't think you need to, but you might be persuaded by physics), then you can only talk about the rate of flow. Could we disagree on the rate of flow? I think so. Perhaps what feels like an hour to me feels like a minute (how I experience it) to you. Allow me to take a break for a moment to discuss cause and effect. In the simplest form, cause and effect says nothing about rate of processes occurring. It refers solely to the direction of time flow. Accordingly, if you happen to be persuaded by physics that we physically could not experience time in the other way, then it seems that cause and effect loses that fundamental of quale: the inability to compare. If everyone experiences time in the same direction, and we know this, then who cares? It'd be like being able to compare colors above. Anyway, back to the flow of time. Up until now, there seems to be no reason to distinguish the experience of the flow of time from other qualia. But I'm wondering if it'd be possible for us to determine the rate of flow for an individual? Perhaps from something like brain waves or properties of your neurons? Might there be something which we can now observe that would lead us to think that someone is actually experiencing time faster. An example I'm thinking about would be someone who has faster reflexes than someone else. Now, there are at least two types of examples that could lead someone to have faster reflexes. The first is that they have simply have more neural connectivity that allows this person to perform a given activity faster. The other possibility would be two people who have identical neural structures, yet one is lacking myelin sheaths. Instances of the second sort seem more important to this discussion. In the first case, the electrons in the brain are traveling at the same speed, they just have further to go. In the second case, the electrons actually are moving slower. But the question remains as to whether or not we would experience time slower if the electrons in our brain were going slower. I'd like to think that it would. We have reason to believe that all our experiential processing happens in our brain, so surely if our brain was processing things slower that would lead to a sluggish experience of time? This hinges on electrons being the mediating particle in brain processing, which I'm not sure we have any strong reason to believe. But it seems possible. Maybe you disagree or are unconvinced. That is completely fine. I'm just writing some thoughts I found interesting and relevant to your question. I hope you at least find them interesting, if not convincing. =) 

Epistemologically, is there any difference between a belief in non-interventionist evolution and a belief in young-earth creationism? If so, what is it? I'm not interested in the question of whether evolution is compatible with religious belief but rather in discerning whether there is any meaningful epistemological distinction between what Richard Dawkins (as a prototype) believes and what is believed by many Biblical literalists. Is one belief more "justified" or "sound" than the other? Do these beliefs belong to the same "class" of knowledge or are they fundamentally different? 

The short answer: Your premise is not correct. Quantum Mechanics is not necessarily complex-valued. Here is a primer from Physics.SE if you are solid on the math. An explanation that is light on math: Complex numbers represent a particular collection of symmetries that behave in a particular way. They happen to be closely related to Real numbers because real numbers encode information about size and directionality in one dimension while Complex numbers do this in two dimensions. The number "i" is actually a sort of mathematical shorthand for "rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise." This has the upshot that 2-D vectors and traditional 2-D vector algebra can be simply and cleanly represented by complex numbers and complex algebra. The important thing about quantum theory is that states are no longer coupled to observables as they are in classical physics. Now, the state a particle is in can mix and combine with other states freely, and the observables have no value until measured. Complex numbers (since they add extra "room") encode this mixing potential in a convenient way. I would recommend that you think about mathematics as being the "science of thought." Every mathematical idea was invented by someone to systematically describe something. This means that when a mathematical idea doesn't generalize to a "common sense" situation (like "i" mangoes) then that means you have removed it from its intended realm of application. Natural numbers are good for counting mangoes because they act like mangoes; complex numbers are good for describing wave functions because (in a way) they behave like wave functions. Try not to put the cart before the horse.
