That is, this algorithm does not always determine whether B is logically entailed (or equivalently, whether B is provable, thanks to the properties of soundness and completeness of FOL). If either B or ~B is provable, we will eventually find its proof. But if neither B nor ~B is provable then we can never tell whether there is no proof or whether we just need to keep looking. So this algorithm does not give us an answer for every B, but we can ask whether there is a better algorithm that does give us an answer for every B. Turing's halting problem is used to show that there is no algorithm for determining whether B is logically entailed. First-order logic is complete because all entailed statements are provable, but is undecidable because there is no algorithm for deciding whether a given sentence is or is not logically entailed. 

Dasein means (the mode of) human existence, a la Heidegger. Heidegger postulates that we humans are the only entities that can ask the question of our own existence as well as existence itself. Neither dogs nor ants can ask that kind of question. For this reason, Heidegger thinks that knowing about human existence is the only window to know about the existence itself. A (Cartesian) dualist holds the view that the world is composed of things that extend and things that think. Heidegger famously rejected the Cartesian dualism. To Heidegger, we humans as beings are necessarily situated in the spatio-temporal coordinate (or beings-in-the-world, a la Heidegger). Separating oneself from the world, i.e., the stage for the Cartesian skepticism, is impossible. Dreyfus is well known for his anti-AI view, that is, it is impossible for machine intelligence to be equivalent to human intelligence. 

The question is in what way I make a difference through my vote, given that my vote has 0 probability to make any difference in the outcome in the majoritarian or Westminster democracy (term a la Arend Lijphart). This is a question addressed by political scientists, not by political philosophers. To understand the question, we first need to know the pivotal theory of voting, advanced from the economist front (mainly by social choice theorists). The theory begins with stating that my voting is meaningful if and only if my vote can make a difference. The reason, according to the theory, is that a rational and self-interested person will pursue a course of action only when her agency matters. Her agency is non-existent in a national election (i.e., 0 probability to make a difference). Thus follows from the theory is that it is irrational for her to vote, let alone study the agenda. A lemma of the theory thus is rational ignorance that voters purposefully choose to remain ignorant and not to learn about agenda for the reason of lacking agency in voting. It has been political scientists who tried to refute the pivotal voting theory. Professor Gerry Mackie at UCSD (my dissertation committee member) offers the contribution theory of voting, according to which voting is instrumental to locate public good, and citizens do aim to contribute to the advancement of the public good. Thus it is rational for citizens to vote. To Mackie, individuals vote not for the reason of pivotness, but for the reason of contribution toward the group effort. A similar contribution idea was also offered by Josiah Ober, Stanford University political scientist and classic literature theorist. Ober elaborates Aristotle's analogy of democracy as a potluck party to argue for the agency as well as epistemicness of democracy. Political scientists' answer to the question then is contribution, which is involved with agency. Footnote Aristotle's potluck analogy: When comparing democracy with aristocracy and oligarchy (both are characterized by rule by a few) in terms of wisdom, Aristotle questions which party has more food, a party prepared by money from a few rich individuals, or a party prepared by money from all. Aristotle says that the latter has more food. From this, Aristotle concludes that there is reason to think that the democratic decision is smarter than the others. 

Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations indeed is a foundation for a school of thought in sociology, called social constructionism (or constructivism). One field in sociology is identity question, that is, "How do we identify who we are in terms of our gender, race, and ethnicity?" One popular answer is called social identity theory which asserts that social groups are real and exist prior to individuals. Self-identity, according to this view, obtains through social group realism. Some sociologists however believe that this picture of self-identity is wrong since one's group identification tends to be fluid and under-determined. According to them, we identify where we belong not by virtue of pre-existing social groups, but by socialization (e.g., upbringing). To reject the social-group realism, these sociologists need theoretical backing, and they find it in Wittgenstein theory that the meaning of a word is its use in the linguistic community. Consider 'Santa Claus'. Santa Claus does not exist, but talking about him has perfect meaning. To Wittgenstein, it does not matter what image of Santa Claus we have in our head. What matters is that we understand sentences that include 'Santa Claus' and know how to use the word properly in our linguistic behaviors. So long as people in the linguistic community understand sentences containing 'Santa Claus', they can be said to know what the word means. This idea of Wittgenstein is called meaning as use theory. Social constructionsts apply this theory to argue that the meaning of race or gender depends on how the linguistic group use the words, thus the outcome of the social construction. 

The distinction between deductive and inductive reasoning is not as simple as you seem to think. Sure: Aristotle's syllogism is a paradigm case of deductive reasoning, and the inference of "All ravens are black" from the observation of many black ravens is that of inductive reasoning. But what about probabilistic reasoning? Inference methods that are involved with probability is categorized under Inductive Logic in SEP. In light of its involvement with uncertainly of the conclusion it looks like an inductive reasoning. But, the conclusion of the probabilistic reasoning is necessarily true. Given a fair coin, the probability of observing two heads in two tosses is one fourth. In this light, probabilistic reasoning looks deductive. So to determine whether probabilistic reasoning is deductive or inductive, we need the defining characteristics of deductive and inductive reasoning. Consider Aristotle's syllogism: if A then B; if B then C; thus if A then C. In this deductive reasoning, the truths of the premises are transmitted to the truth of the conclusion. When done right (i.e, in a valid argument), if all the premises are true, then the the conclusion must be true. For this reason, deductive reasoning is called the truth preserving inference. What does the raven inference reveal? It moves from particulars (sample) to universals (population). The characteristic of inductive reasoning is generalization. Generalization is always involved with uncertainly, or making a mistake. That is, even if the particulars (premises) are true, a statement regarding the population (conclusion) might not be necessarily true. Inductive reasoning is not truth preserving. Traditionally, there is a division of labor in the study of two reasoning methods. Logicians study deductive reasoning: e.g., Aristotle's syllogism, Frege's first-order logic. In light of truth preserving-ness, a probability theory can be said to be deductive. That is, given the probability values of premises, the probability value of the conclusion must be true. Thus, Carnap's probabilistic logic can be also included in the deductive reasoning. Statisticians study inductive reasoning. Since an inference from sample to population (from sample value to parameter value) is always involved with fallibility, statisticians need to quantify uncertainty, inherent in their inference. How to quantify the uncertainty led to different schools of statistics: the Neyman-Pearson school, Fisher-ians, and Baysians. 

What is scientific and meaningful is what is verifiable. Rudolf Carnap proposed this ideology in Pseudo Problems in Philosophy (1928). Ethics and metaphysics deal with unverifiable stuff, so is unscientific, and so is meaningless. 

Using the same example as a), "Bulldogs are dogs", being a dog is necessary to be a bulldog. Thus the given statement is false. 

Since I see a meaningful disagreement between Conifold and ChristopherE, and since I learned a few utilitarianism chops from my master (The religion of my dissertation adviser (Professor Arneson) was act utilitarianism), I thought I could serve as a judge. 

All of this is a description of what is typically done in formal systems. These systems are known to be consistent and to capture all of mathematics. Your observation of unanswerable questions is a good criticism of naive semantics for language, and observations like it are part of the reason that these hierarchical formal systems were developed instead. 

Xunzi famously argued that the human nature is evil, and thus for human beings to live in peace and harmony, they need to learn from sages (masters) 禮, and live according to the teachings of 禮 (禮 is pronounced in Korean 'ye,' meaning manners or rite or rituals; I do not know the Chinese pronunciation). Examples of 禮 are being an obedient son and wife, and performing sacrifice for the dead ancestors. This is an example of the Korean sacrifice. 

As Isaacson points out, Kant's moral system is very complex and, as such, focusing on a few aspects can lead us to lose sight of some other important aspects of his system. But your questions themselves can be answered straightforwardly. Your first question is how Kant can be consistent when he says that morality requires free will yet morally worthy act is an act performed out of the sense of duty. Your complaint can be legitimate from a common sense perspective: acting out of duty means acting without choice, that is, acting without free will. But for Kant acting otherwise (out of self-interest) is acting without free will. To Kant, your statement, I do not think that it's tenable to say we do things outside of an egoism actually proves his point that, without free will, we could be the slave of egoism (self-interest, pleasure, personal values and projects). The difference between you and Kant is that to you free will is to promote self-interest, but to Kant free will is to overcome the egoistic compulsion. Once we exercise free will and employ reasoning capacity, we can arrive at the deontic morality, according to Kant. Thus holds the Kantian equation: rationality + free will = moral prescription Your second question is how an act done out of the sense of duty can be properly moral since such an act sounds rather robotic, merely following a prescribed moral algorithm. Your question (complaint, precisely) is legitimate indeed as Bernard Williams made his career out of criticizing this algorithmic aspect of the Kantian (and utilitarian) morality, and a new paradigm of morality called particularism that rejects any universal moral algorithm was born. 

This is the core question in the field called the ethics of assistance. The indispensable guy in this field is Peter Singer, an uncompromising utilitarian, the most dangerous man in the world today a la his critics. To Singer, the answer to your question is, "Yes, it is immoral to do so." According to Singer, we should give until there is no money left for frivolous consumption, that is, until our spending is reduced to the need-based consumption. This implies that either our living standard should be reduced to the global poor or that we should spend our lives on saving the global poor. Singer's answer instigated the moral sentiment of quite many philosophers. Their shared view, based on the common sense, is that our duty of beneficence towards far-away needy strangers can or should never be so demanding as Singer asserts. That is, almost all philosophers in this field want to say vigorously, "No, it is not immoral" to your question. They want to show that it is morally permissible to spend money on things we want and spend our lives towards our own personal projects, once we donated some money to charity. The question for them is how (or when) to stop giving without looking selfish. Some suggested solutions for the stopping rule are these: you can go on living your life when you did your fair share in saving the global poor (Liam Murphy); giving any further will make your life worse off in the sense that you will not be able to pursue the life project that you identify yourself with (Richard Miller). According to Miller, for instance, once donating some significant amount of money to charity, a Roger-Ebert wannabe can spend her money to buy movie tickets to be a great film critic, her life goal. The debate between Singer and the common sense theorists is still going on since the common sense theorists have failed to offer a knockout stopping rule. However many times the Roger-Ebert wannabe has saved drowning children, she still looks selfish, when she decides to go on to watch a movie and letting this drowning child die. 

Connectionists (e.g., Paul and Patricia Churchland, and William Bechtel, all UCSD people), on the other hand, maintain that the mind is merely the neural net in the brain, which in turn is viewed as a vector processor. The Lockean simple and complex ideas are just due to the complexity in the vector calculation. 

I am just answering the question since there is no reason to leave this question marked as being unanswered. The given set of statements does not constitute an argumentum ad hominem fallacy. For the fallacy to occur, the following two conditions must be met: 

What properties constitute a definition? It depends on whom you are raising the question to, as virmaior commented. The SEP article you mention offers some families of definitions of 'definition' as well. But if we confine ourselves to matters relating to definitions in a formal system, we should be talking about the debate between Frege and Hilbert at the turn of 20th century. The two intellectual giants fought over what ‘definition’ must mean. The memorable quote for beer loving logicians and mathematicians is a by-product of their debate: 

Conifold is correct to point out the harmful effects of a society that routinely practices euthanasia (the kill-one-to-save-five type example): 

To me the above example sounds like being related to the category of fallacies that arise due to missing the point. Fallacies of this category include strawman, Non Sequitur, Ignoratio Elenchi and red herring. Among these, red herring fits the description best. The fallacy occurs when an irrelevant subject is interjected into the conversation to divert attentions away from the main issue. More specifically, in offering an argument toward a certain topic, the arguer changes the topic and provides evidence that is irrelevant to the original topic, and then draws a conclusion about the original topic through the distraction. This is an example: 

Quine is famous for suggesting that we should 'naturalize' epistemology. By naturalizing, he meant bringing epistemology under the microscope of science, whether that being psychology, physiology, or cognitive science. The suggestion is not a testable thesis supported by arguments, but a proposal for a new paradigm in the study of epistemology. Why did Quine have the urge to reduce epistemology into a branch of science? Because he believed that the traditional epistemology (TE) is a lost cause. To Quine, the mantra of TE is the search for clear and distinct ideas (or clear and distinct (atomic) sentences by logical empiricists). Naturally, to him, Descartes is the paragon of TE, and we know how badly Descartes search went: the Cartesian skepticism only saved by Cogito Ergo Sum, which to many is just wtf. Quine himself tried to kill off the Cartesian minions (logical empiricists) with his "Two Dogmas of Empiricism." 

In political science, the person who defined (rather postulated) the nation state as the territorial monopoly on violence is attributed to Max Weber. Weber's own precise expression is "the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory” (in his Politics as a Vocation). By legitimate, Weber means the successful execution of power monopolization to the effect that the monopolizing entity has the military force, and the people within the territory acknowledge only this entity's having the power and obey its commands. That is, as a sociologist, Weber did not attach any normative value to legitimacy. Under this interpretation, there is no moral difference between the nation state and mafia. The intellectual tendency in political science and sociology (e.g., Mancur Olson in Power and Prosperity) in fact is that the origin of the nation state is the last mafia standing. That is, the one that was able to eliminate all other competing mafias and to create a stable method of succession became the essential constituent of the government. It is political philosophers who have attributed normative value to legitimacy. Based on this background in academia, Max Weber should be the guy you are looking for. There are two problems however. One is that Weber's definition comes after the publication of Stirner's The Ego and Its Own, which was published in 1844: Weber's was published in 1918. A way to solve this problem is to indicate that it is the historical common sense that only the state has the right to violence. That is, even peoples in antiquity understood the violent yet justified power of the government (e.g., who killed Socrates?) If any entity grasps a person with force and puts the person in a tiny room without the person's consent, we call it kidnapping; if the government does the same thing, it is called retributive justice. Second, your phrase of "the state should hold monopoly on violence" is incorrect in that no scholars meant monopolization of violence prescriptively. They meant it as a descriptive, defining idea of a nation state, as "the state holds monopoly on violence.
