Terrorism is classified as war and thus understood in the context of war ethics. Traditionally, the ethics is divided into two considerations: when to go to war or who has the moral right to start a war (called jus ad bellum), and what should be morally permissible ways of acting during the war (called jus in bello). Under jus in bello, citizens are viewed as non-combatants, and thus as being innocent. Thus argued is that terrorism whose nature is the attack of citizens is morally impermissible. Viewed in this light, terror acts attract public outcry for the acts' moral impressibility. Now the story does not end here. Many terrorists regard themselves as freedom-fighters, and regard their cause as being just. This means that they can appeal to jus ad bellum. That is, in a way they believe that they have the right to start a war. They then argue that in a democracy, all the citizens are morally, collectively culpable when their leaders engage in unjust wars. After all, it is the citizens who chose their leaders. There are articles that concede this point, yet try to show why attacking democratic citizens is nonetheless morally impermissible (.e.g, terrorism makes people live in constant fear, which is despotic. Meeting injustice with another injustice thus cannot be justified.) 

You rightly complain that Hurka’s test of knowledge is ‘vague and imprecise.’ In fact, Hurka’s suggested test is not his own, but is borrowed from a model of scientific explanation in philosophy of science, called Deductive-Nomological Model, or covering law model. So answering your question, this D-N model is what Hurka means exactly. Hurka is merely glossing over the model, and thus looks ‘vague and imprecise.’ So the question really is not what constitutes the test, but why he is talking about a test of knowledge. Hurka is famous for his perfectionist view of good life: that is, a well-lived life is the perfection of proper human faculties, or equivalently, the pursuit of intrinsic goods. Following Aristotle, Hurka distinguishes three types of intrinsic goods: physical perfection (6-pack abs), theoretical perfection (knowledge), and practical perfection (ruling for the happiness of the people). Regarding physical perfection, Hurka beleives that life should go better for those pursuing 6-pack abs than those, gluttony. After explaining physical perfection, Hurka moves on to explain what he means by the theoretical perfection, which is the above passage. To Hurka knowledge can be pursued in different ways: the Trivial Pursuit way (e.g., knowledge of movie costars), and the systematic way (knowledge of natural laws). Hurka believes that the latter way of pursuing knowledge is far better than the former way based on his criterion (test). By appealing to the test, Hurka can establish that the theoretical perfection is best found in scholar's life. He then moves on to explain politicians’ pursuit of practical perfection. Hurka’s goal in his paper “The Well-Rounded Life,” however, is not to explain what these types of perfection are. His goal is to solve a problem he perceives lurking in the perfectionist life style. Pursuing the 6-pack abs at the gym could mean forgoing the theoretical perfection attainable at the library. That is, leading a perfectionist life style could entail an un-rounded life, and a well-rounded life style could entail mediocre achievements. He wants to show how a perfectionist life can be well-rounded life. 

Nietzsche regarded eternal recurrence as a burden of the heaviest weight. But why should it be? It could be the source for the delightful lightness of being, like the happy Sisyphus of Camus. 

I’ll consider three interpretations of your question. I’m pretty sure you are thinking of the third, but the other two are useful for building up to give the final answer. 

The question is what would libertarian morality say to a person who wonders whether it is morally permissible for him to save his own life by taking a bottle of water, which belongs to someone else. The situation is such that the parched person cannot gain the consent of the bottle owner (either the owner is not there or refuses to give him although she does not need the water), and he plans to compensate the bottle owner with a new bottle asap. The answer by Guill is called hard (or hard-line) libertarianism (term a la Richard Arneson), which is majorly associated with Ayn Rand's idea. For hard-line libertarianism, the consent of the right holder is sacrosanct. The parched man cannot obtain the consent of the bottle owner, thus taking the bottle is morally impermissible. The hard-line libertarian will have to say that the parched man may not take the bottle, and the morally right thing for him to do is to die of thirst. Surely, hard-line libertarians are cold-hearted, as Jobermark remarks, "If you keep water from someone dying of thirst, even if they manage not to die in spite of you, you are not welcome to be an American." Not only being callous, hard-line libertarianism is impractical. Things happen in life where obtaining consent is infeasible when one tries to bring about morally desired or permissible acts (e.g., the right holder is unconscious, demented, deranged, or absent). Does this mean that, as alanf asserts, "you can take anything you want. You might have to pay compensation afterward or something like that." Can compensation replace the absence of consent for liberatarians? That is, is it morally permissible to infringe upon the rights of others on the condition that full compensation to the injured right-bearer is made? This is the question that Nozick, an academic libertarian as opposed to the populist libertarian Ayn Rand, tackled in his Anarchy, State, and Utopia. Noizick understands that the infringement of some rights without the consent of the right holder sometimes is morally permissible if appropriate compensation is made. Nozick, however, asserts that compensation cannot substitute for the omission of consent. The reason, according to Nozick, is that the allowance of after-the-fact compensation will distort the system of fair distribution of the benefits of voluntary exchange, which is the backbone of Nozick's entitlement theory of distributive justice and private property. Once you took my stuff and used it, it becomes hard to determine what is the appropriate level of compensation. The shape of transaction before and after the event will be quite different. The parched man might have gladly paid $10 for the bottle Nozick owned, but now that he is no longer thirsty, he might offer Nozick $1 as a compensation, the price at a grocery store. This transaction, according to Nozick, is unfair. Given the potential conflict with his entitlement theory, Nozick avoids to offer a clear guideline for the moral permissibility of right infringement in a non-consent situation with full compensation. The current goal of libertarians is how to become a bleeding heart libertarian (e.g., Matt Zwolinski and John Tomasi). 

Socrates preached to the Athenian young that those with governing power should have the knowledge of the Good. To him, a person obtains this knowledge when she realizes that this world is merely a shadow of the real world. The cave fable of Plato illustrate this idea. This view of Socrates is called philosopher kingship. Plato's republic and Aristotle's aristocracy were examples to embody this view that knowledge is political power. To arrive at this view, Socrates assumes that there is the absolute truth and some humans can access the truth. Historically speaking, Socrates, with this notion of absolute truth, tried to refute the going, powerful view of the sophists who denied the absolute truth. Their intellectual godfather, Protagoras, famously stated that "Man is the measure of all things." The saying is interpreted as meaning that truth is what each individual construes. Another important sophist, Gorgias, moved this truth relativism idea further to truth nihilism. According to him, "Nothing exists; even if existence exists, it is inapprehensible to humans; even if existence is apprehensible, it certainly cannot be communicated or explained to others." Their differing views on truth directly influenced their answers to the question, "Who should have the political power?" Socrates' answer was that only those with the knowledge of absolute truth should rule. Socrates' answer meant a refutation of democracy since, to him, 'demo' meant the stupidity of the crowd. To the sophists, on the other hand, knowledge was relative and possibly non-existent, and, in this case, each and every citizen should have a political say. The answer by the sophists, then, was the affirmation of going Athenian democracy. And the rest, the fate of Socrates, is history. 

Given these, let's answer the question. Dreyfus’ Heidegger argues that science cannot explain the mode of human existence. Indeed Heidegger argued that the human condition is known analytically, by “existential analytic of Dasein” ($URL$ So Dreyfus' Heidegger rejects physicalism and materialism (views that try to explain mental phenomena by means of science or by res extensa). Rejecting physicalism does not make Heidegger a dualist. Why? Ameet Sharma is in the right direction since Dreyfus' Heidegger thinks that the physical world can be explained only in terms of Dasein. (see 1) In the video, Dreyfus is forced to answer how scientific realism is possible under the Heideggerian view, or more specifically, under the Husserlian phenomenological method (an alternative way to understand the physical phenomena) which Heidegger adopted. The potential problem raised for Dreyfus is that if scientific realism is true, then the above 3 (beings-in-the-world) cannot be true. I think Dreyfus's answer is brilliant, which we can only observe from a philosopher master (Professor Hubert Dreyfus passed away this year (2017). Ah Time, that completes us all!). Dreyfus says that it is indeed scientists’ job to explain the natural phenomena, but it is thanks to the phenomenology that warrants the doings of scientists. 

Leibniz (1646-1716) in the history of philosophy is known for the monad theory. The philosophical issue of the 17th century was the mind-body problem (or more broadly, the seeming causal interactions of things in the physical world), originating from the defects in the Cartesian dualist view of substance. To post-Descartes scholars, explaining the nature of substance amounted to solving the problem. In the big scheme of the history of thought, the monad theory can be viewed as an attempt at a solution. Here I explain Leibniz's conceptions of the monad (for detail, refer to the excellent entry, "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz" in SEP), and show which conception Dalton borrowed from Leibniz. Postulation of the logical conception of substance To explain what substance is, Leibniz takes us to the God's point of view. From the omniscient point of view, the past, the present and the future of a thing is already contained in that thing. Translated linguistically, all the predicates that are true of the subject is already embedded in the subject. To God, the happenings in the physical world are, so-to-speak, analytic truths. To Leibniz, substance must be something like analytical truth from God's point of view. Since a thing that contains everything in it (e.g., its past, present, future, even the whole universe and soul) is analytical truth for God, substance must be something that contains everything in it. For this reason of unity, substance cannot be divided. Since nothing that is divisible is substance, to Leibniz, the Cartesian matter, which is divisible, is not substance. The Leibnizian way of understanding substance is called the logical conception of substance. To avoid confusion, Leibniz calls his idea of substance (a thing that contains everything within) monad. These are some lemmata of this nature of monad (I list them without proof): Lemmata 

The philosopher was charged on two accounts: impiety and corruption of the youth. The trial of Socrates occurred in 399 BCE with jury of about 500 men. Prosecutors argued that Socrates failed to acknowledge the Athenian Pantheon gods, and preached the youth about strange deities. Socrates, rejecting both charges, offered his own legal defense against the accusations of corruption and impiety, which was recorded in Plato’s Apology. Regarding the corruption charge, Socrates argued that he was a teacher to the Athenian youth, not a corrupter. Regarding the atheism charge, Socrates maintained that the charge was absurd since the accuser talked about a topic that the accuser had no knowledge of. Socrates however failed to acquit himself, as the majority jury decision was that Socrates was guilty as charged. Since Socrates denied the charges, we must infer what the persecutors had in mind through Socrates' teaching. Regarding the impiety charge that Socrates introduced new gods, the persecutors must have meant the Good and the world of Ideas (or Forms). The fable of the cave, which occurs in Plato's Republic elucidates Socratic deities. Once upon a time there were a bunch of people, all chained, lived in a cave. They were able to see only flickering shadows on the wall, cast by the fire behind them. They thought the shadows were real. One day one guy managed to unshackle himself and climbed out of the cave. Voila! What did he see! The sun, the tree, the flower! He realized that the things he used to see in the cave were just shadows of these real things. The corruption charge can be an entailment of the impiety charge due to his role as a teacher. Since Socrates taught his theory of the Good to youth, the persecutors could argue that Socrates corrupted the youth. Another way of looking at the corruption charge will be Socrates' theory of the Philosopher King: i.e., rulers must be a few wise individuals who have the knowledge of the truth. The theory is a natural extension of the cave fable. That is, the guy who was able to see the world of Ideas should rule. The reality of course was different. This guy hurried back to the cave to tell the people that what they were seeing was mere shadows and there was a real world out there. Sadly, no one believed him and thought he had gone mad. That guy in Plato's fable symbolizes Socrates. Viewed in this light, the charges against Socrates can be viewed as being politically motivated. Socrates had been criticizing the Athenian democracy of his time. Socrates maintained that it is not the majority opinion, but genuine knowledge and professional competence, that yields a correct policy and a just verdict. Socrates believed that democracy is embedded with the vice of the many, and would eventually lead to tyranny since in democracy those without wisdom rule the nation. The people would be easily beguiled by a demagogue whose intent is to usurp the power to benefit himself. Appendix: The Impact of "The Clouds" on jurors 'Yshavit' brings out a good point on the political circumstance. Another point that might have impacted negatively on the trial of Socrates should be Aristophanes' 'The Clouds,' a comedy play that lampooned Socrates. In fact, Socrates suspects the play could be the cause for the charge against him. In the comedy, after learning from the 'fictional' Socrates, a son argues for the right to beat his own father (the argument is quite persuasive!). The jurors were made up of old people (In 'The Wasps,' another comedy play by Aristophanes, the Athenian court was depicted as the pension plan for old people). The jurors should have watched 'The Clouds' and should have found the Socrates caricatured in the comedy abominable. Thus, more than majority could have voted against Socrates.
