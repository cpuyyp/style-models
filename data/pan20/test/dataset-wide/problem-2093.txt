You should first order your preferences. If they say no to full-time, is your next best option to take their part-time offer? or would you subsiquently not choose them at all? This could have a large impact on how you should present your request. Sounds like there are a number of questions about the internship like how many of their interns turn into full-time, which you might want to fill in by talking with them in more detail. You should figure out which questions you need to ask and what answers you need to hear to prefer it. If you would only choose them as full-time, there is no reason to beg or demand or bring in emotion in anyway. You can simply state in a matter of fact way that if the company was able to offer you a full-time position, it would be your top choice, but that you're primarially interested in full-time, so if they couldn't you will select one of your other full time offers. If you're going to choose them either way you can still request a full-time offer, but perhaps just tell them that the company is your first choice but that you're weighing it against other full-time offers and if they also offered full-time it would make your decision much easier. You should collect your thoughts about the questions you want to ask about the internship that would impact your decision, the answers you would want to hear, and the responses you would give in each situation, like my above example responses. Then take care of all of them in one phone call where you can get your answers as well as make the full-time request with the appropriate force. 

Transparent salaries means both the decision makers and the top earners will face more scrutiny. This creates an incentive to justify the salaries with more objective measures, which aren't necessarily better measures. One of the easiest default objective measures that will end up having a more weight in a transparent salaried company is years working for the company. Salaries will also likely become less extreme, and more people will get closer to the average. Any parts of performance that aren't objective will simply get less weight in the equation because they are hard to justify so make everyone uncomfortable. This means that exceptional and young employees working in fields where performance is mostly subjective will end up making less at a companies with transparent salaries, so they may just go elsewhere, but older worse employees will stick around. Even if the salary setters were stubborn and ignored their incentive to lean more towards easy to justify objective measures and paid everyone simply based on their best subjective measure of performance, it'll likely make the top performers uncomfortable making more than everyone else but not being able to objectively justify themselves either. You see this effect in Sweden where all tax returns are public and people make much closer to the median salary. 

As a new mom, I've felt very lucky to have a workplace that makes no complaints about my need to pump and that has a room for that purpose. Unfortunately, that room is attached to the first aid room (which requires a key) and, today, I found a woman in the lactation space who said she wasn't feeling well and was trying to find a place to rest for a bit. Since the room is specifically for lactation usage, I had no issues telling her that I needed the space and I let her know that I would be finished in about a half hour. I didn't want to make someone already feeling unwell feel unwelcome but I'm concerned about transfer of whatever is making her feel poorly to me and to my baby. I'm generally not an overly germ-conscious person and I know that many women don't even have the facilities that I do... but is it unreasonable for me to talk to our administration staff about preventing people who are sick from being in the lactation room? I don't think there are any legal requirements that the room must be only for lactation purposes. 

Talk to her. Don't ask about the weight gain. If you don't feel like you know her job well enough to do a good job when she's out, that's enough reason to ask to shadow her for a day or two, pick her brain, etc. Even if she's not pregnant or planning to be out, people do go on vacation for a week or two from time to time, get in catastrophic accidents, or have long term illnesses. My boss was suddenly diagnosed with cancer and has been out since December and will probably be out for another four months. You don't know how much I wish I'd asked to learn more about what he does before he got sick. If she's the one interacting with customers, you should be able to step in (relatively) seamlessly, so part of your job is knowing hers. Please, do yourself a favor - see if you can meet to learn what she does! 

I would let them know that you have food allergies, thank them for their offer of lunch but demur and let them know that you will bring your own lunch as your allergies can be difficult to accommodate. They may write back and say that they're happy to order a lunch that won't cause an allergic reaction if you let them know what the allergies are or they may simply accept that you will bring your own lunch. Please, please don't eat food that will make you sick just to make a good impression. Depending on the severity of the reaction (particularly if it makes you fall asleep), you will just make your interview extremely uncomfortable for everyone involved... ending an interview with them calling an ambulance isn't great for anyone involved. And ordering a lunch and not eating it looks wasteful and people will wonder why the lunch you selected was not acceptable to you. If they understand your needs and your preference to supply your own food, that should be enough for them. It's really common for people to have both medical and non-medical (religious, diet, lifestyle) reasons for dietary restrictions and a good company will be respectful of that. 

If you haven't even had a first interview, that would be too much information too early. Just go for the interviews, and if you get an offer or are asked about availability, set the date so that you can get your bonus first. I wouldn't disclose the reason why you need to wait until date X, unless they want you to join ASAP, in which case you could try to get them to give you a signing bonus to make up for losing the bonus. 

Run for the exits and start looking for a new job immediately. A company that can't make payroll is in very serious trouble, partly because it's a self-fulfilling prophecy: even if that client payment they're promising does come through, so many people will lose faith, start looking for new jobs and quit that it's exceedingly unlikely that they can pull out from the death spiral. 

There are two different aspects here: valuing a job offer, and negotiating a job offer. A company I used to work for had an elaborate scheme for paying up to 15% bonuses depending on profit, performance, etc. Unfortunately they were also chronically loss-making, so they never actually paid out a cent. Actual value of the bonus to me when comparing salaries: $0. But when I received an offer from a different company and started negotiating it, of course I mentioned this: "Well, your 15% bonus is nice, but my current company has the same plan, so this works out about the same. Can we revisit the base salary?" (Even though I knew well that the new company makes steady profits and pays out the 15% like clockwork.) 

No. If the jobs are not relevant and do not leave any strange gaps, feel free to omit them. Or better yet, summarize them into a bullet point: 

Approach it like any other job offer. Not only are you in a position to negotiate pay and benefits, but you're in a strong position, because the company would much prefer to hire a known good quantity like you than take their chances with a random outsider! 

Negotiate after you receive the offer. If they select you over the other applicants, they obviously think you're the best candidate and thus worth more than the rest. They've already invested enough time in evaluating you that they're not just going to walk away if you ask for more, so the absolute worst case is that they don't raise the offer. For much more on this topic, see Salary Negotiation on Kalzumeus, specifically the "When Does A Salary Negotiation Happen?" bit (but you really should read the whole thing). And feel free to negotiate over the phone with HR, but get the details of any offers in writing before you accept anything!
