Also in this article there is a reference to Australian property as a haven for laundered funds. I'd imagine that impacts appetite for risk and return requirements markedly. 

What are the key drivers of growth for these small pacific island nations? I would expect tourism and natural resources to be pretty central to these economies. Is there anything else? What are the key barriers to growth here? I would imagine tyranny of distance and small populations couldn't help. I am interested in answers which related both to macro and microeconomics. I would be happy with any references pointing me in the right direction as well. 

If you are thinking of something like an app, consider non monetary costs. They operate in the same way. Like the time value of playing a worse app. or movies, if you are given a choice to watch a terrible movie for free or pay to see a good movie, you may elect to pay. In which case time is a factor. You can't consume an infinite amount of terrible movies at time $t$. In summary, you need to add more to the question. If a good is free, marginal utility has to diminish and $\frac{du}{dx}$ needs to equal $0$ at some point or supply has to be finite. Until at least that is satisfied, the consumer will spend all money on on $x_2$ and hold an infinite amount of $x_1$ 

To me, it is clear there is at least some form of regulatory failure present here. If these places were rezoned into residential, they would get filled very quickly as this phenomenon seems primarily restricted to commercial real-estate. The council (and probably the community) would prefer to have this area remain commercial but residential is surely better than vacant. 

Having the VAT (or GST) as a consumption tax and a production tax has some slightly different conclusions: 

Cities offer advantages and disadvantages. Amenities are more available (both publicly and privately provided) but there are also negative externalities such as congestion, pollution and cost of living. 

So I have done some additional research, I haven't found the resource I am looking for but I do have some worth posting here. When I do find something better, I will update this answer. 

Does it make sense to normalize change in real GDP by the contemporaneous change in population? I'm interested in this calculation for the following reason. Suppose real GDP increases. I'd like to know what was the population increase that corresponded to this increase. I could then compare two distinct geographic regions, specifically two states in USA during a given time period. If one state increased real GDP by A dollars per person (as calculated above) while another increased it by B dollars per person, then I could declare that the first state was, in a sense, more productive or more efficient. If g was the growth rate in real GDP and r was the population growth rate, I could alternatively calculate (1+g)/(1+r) and compare states according to this measure. A comparison based on this ratio is essentially the same as a comparison based on g-r: Just perform the algebraic division and subtract a 1 to get g-r. However, I feel that g-r doesn't have the same intuitive appeal as the method described in the previous paragraph. A numerical calculation on actual data shows that the two measures have a low correlation (of 0.2) .... The method in the first paragraph produces numbers that are on the same footing as GDP per capita and moreover, these calculations can be compared to GDP per capita for an intuitive understanding. For example, during 2010-2014, the change in real GDP divided by the change in population was 108,000 dollars in USA whereas 2014 GDP per capita was 49,000 dollars. For Pennsyvlania, the calculation resulted in 320,000 dollars versus GDP per capita of 47,000 dollars. For California it produced 114,000 dollars vs GDP per capita of 54,000 dollars. Here's how I think about it. In 2010, USA real GDP per capita was 45,000 dollars or thereabouts. From 2010-2014, each person that was added to the population corresponded to a real GDP increase of 108,000 dollars. To get fancy, if there hadn't been any population increase, real GDP might have grown by a certain amount. If we could estimate that amount, we could subtract it from the aforementioned 108,000 dollars and then say with more confidence that each person that was added to the population "caused" real GDP to increase by that much. By analogy, imagine a 100 men were laying bricks (GDP) on top of one another. Each man could lay 10 bricks per hour. Now, 3 younger, stronger men are added to the workforce who can lay bricks at the rate of 50 per hour. The calculation that I am proposing would produce a number analogous to 50 which could then be compared to the number 10 so as to distinguish between the previous stock of labor and the new stock. If you'd like to replace population with employed population, that would be fine ... It's has a secondary role in my question. 

I am not sure I have the knowledge to provide you with a complete answer, but I can provide you with some insight. First assume a pool of potential bidders. They are normally distributed. Each bidder has their own marginal benefit for this stamp. Call this $\alpha$. Each bidder is a utility maximiser with the utility function $u_i=\alpha_i-p_i$. A bidder will continue bidding until they assess that they will be happier with the money in their pocket. 5 bidders are pulled from the pool and given the opportunity to participate in the auction. The result of the auction is that the price the stamp sold for is $p_1=\alpha_2+\epsilon$ The price of the stamp is equal to the marginal benefit of the second highest bidder + an arbitarily small number. This is the price at which no party will raise the bid. If there were a second auction with the same first 5 bidders+ an additional bidder, there is a possibility that this new bidder has a low marginal benefit of this product and has no impact on the price at an auction. The condition for auction 2 to sell higher than auction one is $p_2>p_1=P[\alpha_{entrant}>\alpha_2]$. The marginal benefit of the entrant has to be higher than the marginal benefit of the second highest bidder. The potential price with the addition of a new bidder is bounded between $[\alpha_2,\alpha_1]$. The price will not go any higher than what the second highest bidder is prepared to pay for it. 

Banks are often very regulated and are required to follow the rule of law. Putting money into accounts not on the books is fraud and, due to the nature of double entry accounting, not that easy. This wiki has a list of regulatory authorities which purport to keep the banks honest. The trust in the system has taken a few hits since the GFC and the idea of too big to fail etc. Short answer, the law stops the banks from doing some of the things that you suggest and as with any industry, some people will break it. 

The problem with the paper was that the authors didn't do what they said they did. As part of their analysis, they subjected the data to a battery of tests. They claim to have controlled for a variety of effects which in fact, due to a coding error, they didnt. The Economist explains it as does The Wall Street Journal. 

Well, if not for differences in energy efficiency, GDP would be determined by energy consumption. In a globalized world most businesses and countries have similar energy efficiencies, and if they do differ, poor countries have consistently lower energy efficiency. This preserves a neat correlation between GDP and energy consumption. There is so much empirical evidence of it that it is pretty much a rule. You can browse Google image search to see the evidence of it. Many poor countries lack statistical apparatus to measure their GDP and use data like electricity consumption to estimate their GDP every year. 

Neither American nor World economy will collapse as long as there at least two citizens producing goods and willing to exchange them. Roman Empire's economy did not collapse either, for the record, the Empire did. In any economy some jobs and sectors become obsolete, others take over and attract a lot of capital. At some point of the 20th century the car industry was booming and made Detroit the richest city in America. Then manufacturing jobs got outsourced and now the US economy strives creating IT products. Rich people rely on ordinary people's income and spending to maintain their wealth. It is the average people who buy products made by the rich people's firms and make them rich in the first place. It is the average people who produce goods and services that the rich people buy with their dollars. Also, the democratic political system of a country is centered around the median voter, the ordinary guy . If the tax and wealth redistribution policies favor rich too much, people will vote for more redistribution of wealth. This ensures resilience and sustainability of modern democracies, something the Roman Empire did not have. There is a balance, or equilibrium, between how much capital the rich get rewarded for their contributions to society and how much an average Joe earns on the average job. In this equilibrium there are very rich, there are poor, and there are unemployed. Sometimes, it may seem, rich become too rich and there are too many poor. 

My advice is to take out loans instead of working overtime during your university years. You are likely to be working for a very low wage until you get your degree. If you instead spend your time trying to excel academically, after graduation your per hour earnings may be several times higher than your wage as a student. Take advantage of loan availability and low interest rates. Don't worry about what other people say. Let others graduate debt-free with chronic illnesses, psychological disorders, and on the bottom of their class. Of course they are going to be bitter because you are going to get more with less effort. 

Mas-Collel is very popular. It is very math heavy. Every idea and concept is done pretty rigorously and it pretty well covers everything. The book is a very slow read and is sometimes uneven. Very detailed in some sections and not as good in others. That said, in my experience, it is the graduate microeconomics bible. If you have a question, your answer is somewhere in there. 

The Greeks have been negotiating the terms of the bailout for many months now. Liquidating assets would have been considered and I expect will happen as part of these new measures. 

Inflation $$\frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}$$ Where $P_t$ is the price level at time $t$ This formula is just the percentage change in price. GDP Growth From Investopedia: 

Very interesting question. Those at cafehayek.com seem to dislike it a lot but don't really back it up which is disappointing. At first glance, it is very easy to see how affirmative action could hurt the economy, and construction a model to show this would also be pretty straight forward. 

I refer specifically to this article in which Andrew Critchlow paints a pretty dire view of the Australian economy. The line which challenged my priors was: 

A massive simplification would to look at developed (high wage) countries as experiencing two forces. There is the offshoring pathway. Low skill manufacturing can be offshored to lower waged countries. Output in the home country decreases. Then there is the technological pathway. Automation and innovations can work to take the bottom out of employment, saving on wage costs. Manufacturing will become increasingly dependent on a more skilled employee. Output in the home country increases. The expected trend is one away from the low skill manufacturing (think clothing) towards more complex, bespoke products (think 3D printed prosthetics). The overall environment is notably more complicated with government subsidies, global supply chains and trade deals among others things all being important. Deloitte Access Economics have released a manufacturing competitiveness report which covers elements of this. 

Your question is long and unclear. I suggest editing it to get a better response. I hope you do because I think it has good potential. I am able to help with one element of the question. "is crowd mentality in ranking better than one's own ranking system?" The answer to this really depends on what your own ranking system is. The Wisdom of the Crowd is pretty good at this sort of stuff. That said, I think there is definitely room in something like fantasy football to beat the crowd generated rankings. I find when I am looking for a probabilistic outcome on something like that, a bookmakers site should be one of the first ports of call.
