Conclusion The data indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected at p < 0.01. Discussion This weakens the OP’s friend’s argument that bicycling causes as much environmental damage as commuting. The environmental cost of heating the water for a shower was not included, as it seems to have minimal impact (see dancek's fine answer on this point). Even with a substitution of a more typical American diet with more meats and fewer vegetables, the “bicycling is as bad as a car” hypothesis would be rejected. 

Many sites have noted that the concept of personal space is quite different for Arabs. For example, this Arab Cultural Awareness PDF says 

To the second part of your question, Does this meta review actually support this claim adequately?, I would say “yes,” mostly because the critique does not make a compelling case. While the Howard, et. al. critique implies that Coleman is in self-interest, there may be an element of self-interest in Munk-Olsen detracting from Coleman while promoting the NEJM article (which is in the minority). Taking a parallel line of reasoning, it is interesting to note that abortion is correlated with not only mental but physical outcomes, such as breast cancer. (See “Induced abortion as an independent risk factor for breast cancer: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis” at $URL$ for example.) The window for reproductive problems arising from abortion is limited to the time when the woman can reproduce, say twenty years. In contrast, mental problems can have a much longer delay in onset from the provocative event. For example, PTSD may occur more than twenty years after the provocative event. So the 10% estimate may be underestimating the effect. And if there are physical repercussions to abortion, it is not unreasonable to assume that there may be some mental repercussions as well. On a different line of reasoning: there was a point when there were scientific studies that contradicted the notion that using tobacco products were correlated with lung cancer. (Of course, the tobacco companies vigorously held on to this notion.) With enough studies (and meta-studies), it became better understood that there was a strong correlation. So in conclusion, yes and yes to your questions. The science supports the meta-study’s conclusions. 

Counterexample one: Although there is a ten-fold difference in density between Canada and the US, there is not an appreciable difference in personal space, to my knowledge. In the Middle East, here are some selected population densities: 

One of the questions raised by several of the commenters was that while one can estimate the calories burned by bicycling, it is hard to estimate what change in calories the cyclist requires (over what would have burned by driving to work). I designed an experiment using a Heart Rate Monitor to help me estimate just that. Notes and assumptions Calories were determined by a Heart Rate Monitor, which infers calories burned based on heartbeat count. Assumption: number of heartbeats are directly proportional to actual calories burned. Calories were burned either 1) While driving to a bus stop in a car and then taking the bus to or from work or 2) while bicycling to or from work. Assumption: the cyclist will eat more on the day he cycles, corresponding to the larger quantities of calories being burned. The car travels mostly at highway speeds to the bus park-and-ride. Distance 5.7 miles. Assumption: Nominal 30 mpg and 1 passenger were used to estimate 0.16 gallons of unleaded fuel. Using $URL$ a car fueled with unleaded gasoline produces 8.87 kg of CO2 per gallon. The bus takes a (mostly) express route over highway. Distance 10.8 miles. Using $URL$ and medium haul of .20 kg CO2 per passenger mile. CO2 is a proxy for environmental impact. The commuter is a vegan male, weight 68 kg (150 pounds). Design of statistical test A difference between means (of total CO2 production) was the chosen hypothesis test. $\mu1 represents the mean CO2 emissions required to fuel the bus, car, and the subject's body while commuting. $\mu2 represents the mean CO2 emissions required by the foods needed to sustain the subject's body while bicycling. Null hypothesis: $\mu1 - $\mu2 <= 0 This corresponds to the OP's friend’s assertion that bicycling produces as much or less CO2 as driving. Alternative hypothesis: $\mu1 – $\mu2 > 0 Will choose a significance level of 0.01 Will use a one-tailed test. Experimental data Measurements were taken over a period of about one month. There were 18 measurements taken: 9 by bus and car, 9 by bicycle. Here is the data: 

Did not follow robust methodologies for systematic reviews 1a. No details on search terms 1b. Only two databases included 1c. Lacks citation tracking 1d. Non-standardized measure of mental disorders 1e. Lack of adjustment for pre-existing mental illness 1f. No adjustment for key confounders. Munk-Olsen, the last author of the critique, published in the NEJM that “reported no difference between the incidence of first psychiatric contact before and after abortion.” (7. Munk-Olsen, T., et al., Induced first-trimester abortion and risk of mental disorder. N Engl J Med, 2011. 364(4): p. 332-9) Eleven of the twenty-two papers were authored by Coleman. Synthesis of the data and summary statistics are flawed. Erroneous conclusions drawn regarding the Population Attributable Risk (PAR). 

I can think of a couple of counterexamples. Index Mundi has population density for North America and for the Middle East. One would observe that North America has these population densities (people per square KM): 

Counterexample two: The population densities bracket the North American population densities, but in general, personal space is more similar in the Middle East than between Middle Eastern countries and North American countries of similar population density. Specifically, one would expect Saudis to stand farther apart from each other than those in the US; however, the opposite is true. I think that a different question about population density among similar cultures might yield a different answer. 

You raise several interesting questions. The questions will undergo a modest redirection, but I hope that I will not lose the intent of the OP. Does absolute pitch have a heritable component? Yes, according to this University of California Genetics of Absolute Pitch Study. Both European families and East Asian families had a “linkage peak” at 7q22.3. In an important sense, Yes, perfect pitch is something you are literally born with. Is tone deafness something you are born with? Yes, according to $URL$ which compared identical twins (who share 100% of their genes) and fraternal twins (who share 50% of their genes). The study suggested that “your genetic make-up largely determines your ability to perceive pitch. Spector's team concludes that this skill is roughly 80 per cent hereditary.” This study would suggest that if you (or your identical twin) were tone deaf, then there would be very little chance that you could learn AP, no matter how hard you tried. Life has dealt you a weak hand; stay away from the musical arts. This would be similar to a comment made by a color-blind person. This sex-linked genetic trait will prevent him from a career in interior design. (While I am guessing that user unknown is male, the odds are in my favor.) What if you’re not tone deaf but desperately want to impress that dazzling violinist? Can you learn how to fake AP as well as a Chinese concert pianist who started at the age of four? Maybe, according to Absolute memory for musical pitch: Evidence from the production of learned melodies by Daniel Levitin. You could work on your pitch memory, which is more common. Maybe you could conceal a hit tuning fork, hit it in the bathroom and hum the issuing note sub rosa before you come to the piano. Maybe you could have a mirror or confederate help you figure out what note is being played. Or, barring that, maybe you could memorize the answers for this AP test. 

Patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries experience quadriplegia and paraplegia. With therapy, some portion of the patients will recover the ability to walk, either aided or unaided. Yet some of the treatments date back to Hippocrates. (See this NIH page.) Patients are asked to keep a positive mental attitude, in order to increase both the speed and degree of their recovery. Is there research that demonstrates the effectiveness of positive patient attitude, or would patients recover the same regardless? Or, put another way, is the "Can Do" attitude of sports movies real, or is this the stuff of legend? 

One article that I found was Spinal Cord, (21 June 2011), "Predicting the long-term impact of acquired severe injuries on functional health status: the role of optimism, emotional distress and pain," by O Vassend, A J Quale, O Røise, and A-K Schanke. (I found this by searching Google Scholar for "patient attitude spinal cord injury," which led me to several articles on the journal Spinal Cord. There seemed to be quite a few articles dealing with medical staff attitude, so I just searched Spinal Cord archives for "patient psychology.") The study used a hierarchical regression analysis and a sample size of n=101, with a follow-up 4 years later with n=75. It doesn't say whether patients who adopt an optimistic attitude do better, but instead, that patients who have an optimistic attitude fare better. The article concludes: "high optimism should be regarded as a resilience characteristic, protecting the individual against long-term sequelae of severe physical injury." In contrast, "patients characterized by low optimism, combined with presence of pain and depression/anxiety, may constitute a high-risk group for disability and reduced quality of life." So there may be something to be said for going in with a "can do" attitude. 

Your question Are 10% of mental health problems caused by abortion might be addressed in a number of ways. First, in considering whether there is any evidence to support the claim, one could simply go to the source studies that were included in the meta-analysis. (You may find the referenced studies for free at $URL$ . The full PDF costs $15.) Many of the source studies (Cougle 2008 (US), Pergrusson 2008 (Australia), Gilchrist 1995 (UK) and others) report the increase in mental health problems. All of the articles were published in refereed journals, which means that skepticism is built in, as many experts in that field will try to pick apart a submission. By the way, the nature of a meta-study is not to make new claims, but to summarize existing claims. Canadian authors Mota, Burnett, and Sareen published a study entitled “Associations Between Abortion, Mental Disorders, and Suicidal Behaviour in a Nationally Representative Sample” in the Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, Vol 55, No 4, Aprtil 2010. This article was not cited in the Coleman’s meta-analysis, and yet confirms the same results. When compared to women without a history of abortion, those who had an abortion had a 61% increased risk for Mood Disorders. Social Phobia was linked with a 61% increased risk and suicide ideation with a 59% increased risk. So yes, there is evidence to support the claim. Let us examine the detractors of the article. One of the strongest, most cogent critiques of Coleman’s meta-analysis may be found at $URL$ . Here is an outline of objections from Louise M Howard, Hind Khalifeh, Melissa Rowe, Kylee Trevillion, and Trine Munk-Olsen. 

The lack of citations doesn’t invalidate the meta-study. Lack of key confounders means the critique suggests that Coleman did not account for problems such as social deprivation or rape. On the other hand, it also means that Coleman did not “cherry pick” patients just to prove her point. Munk-Olsen has a single study that contradicts a much larger meta-study. Unfortunately, their study did cherry pick the more healthy ones, for example, excluding women with previous psychiatric history. (See $URL$ While Coleman had written half of the papers in the meta-study, there are many other studies in many different countries that corroborate the meta-study. (Data table for original meta-analysis article, $URL$ The fact that there multiple effects reported in 13 of the 22 studies does not diminish the importance that there are 9 with single factors. (same site, $URL$ I think the critique is implying that Coleman uses circular reasoning: assuming that the risk factor (abortion) causes the disease (mental health problems) while trying to prove the same. I am not familiar with this particular branch of statistics and cannot confirm or dismiss the critique on this point.
