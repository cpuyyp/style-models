Also, being late is already punished. If you arrive at the meeting and everyone is there waiting for you and perhaps saying "hurry up, get in here, you're five minutes late" that is a form of punishment. If you care about your team, that should be all the motivation you need. If you have a chronic latecomer, people who don't like waiting for them and who sit reasonably near them will probably stop by their desks and say "coming to scrum?" This may be less a punishment than a help, it doesn't really matter which way they perceive it as long as the late arriving is reduced by it. However, in the same laughing spirit as silly hats for breaking the build, you can easily make on-the-spot punishments for being late. In most teams I know, nobody ever wants to go first. Therefore make the late comers go first (and second etc) before then carrying on around the circle starting with whoever was standing next to the latecomer(s). Now people will hurry to the meeting so they don't have to go first. If for some reason your team is full of people who like to go first, then latecomers get skipped when we're going around the circle and we'll do you last. If the person says when they arrive "sorry, stuck in traffic, just got in the door" then you can exempt them from the penalty easily enough. I wouldn't suggest anything that has a scope past the meeting, certainly not "tomorrow you have to X." The meeting is what is being disrespected when a person is late, and the meeting is where that is objected to, and moments before the meeting is where it can be prevented. 

It was delivered ominously, like "if you don't make me your priority I will fire you" but without saying it. It was supposed to inspire him to stop "taking time off" if you can call not working the weekend "taking time off." Instead he contacted us, arranged an interview, and told us this story. He was a great candidate, and very motivated - an easy hire. With us he had flextime, and could take his family on business trips (he's not the only one to have done so either) as long as he bought the extra plane tickets. Companies most certainly exist that will support your priorities. That said, be sure that you're being fair. I did have one employee who took time for sick children, but whose husband (working elsewhere) never did. She also came in hours late because one of the cars was not functioning and her husband took the good one. Basically his work never had to do without him and we consistently had to do without her. I didn't care for that. 

You really shouldn't have been working without a plan. When you started getting questions about completion dates, you should have made a plan. Your boss should have at minimum asked for a plan, and more reasonably helped you write one, but not all bosses lead you the way you need to be led. Make a plan. Accept that it will be incomplete and there are things you don't know. Answer your boss and have the backup details that will be required. Be able to go way past yes/no. 

In the past, I went with option 1. I think this is a little easier to do for women - some men will assume we're na√Øve and innocent. I didn't encourage the line of conversation but I didn't object to it either, I just answered what I was asked with whatever came into my head in as unenthusiastic a way as I could. So not "yes, absolutely! I wish more people understood that approach to life!" but more "oh, I suppose, you're probably right" kind of thing. The conversations were super creepy but I was young and really didn't know how to tell him to stop asking me such things. It was a co-op job so after 4 months I moved on and since he never got past "creepy and overly personal conversations that could in theory be interpreted as a fatherly interest in my wellbeing" I didn't have to do anything more than pretend to have no idea what he was trying to start. I am not sure I totally recommend this approach, especially in a job you won't be leaving in a matter of months, but it is the easiest to do. If you can't do that first option, or doing it is seriously creeping you out, then your only options are the other two. Choose between them based on the size of your company. In a large company HR will be competent and you'll be anonymous. In a small company there's no anonymity anyway and chance are there isn't someone who knows how to tell your boss that these conversations are over the line, so you'll have to do it yourself. Probably the simplest thing is to have a standard line like "I'm really not comfortable discussing my private life at work" and trot it out every time you feel your boss is over the line. 

If the person is above you in the hierarchy, a physical gift should be a token, if anything. Something consumable, like chocolates or (not always appropriate) wine. Nothing permanent or super personal like jewelry or a framed picture of yourself. Nothing money-equivalent like a restaurant gift certificate. In that position I would value a thankyou note that was reasonably specific about the behaviours you're thanking for, less 

You have to be very very careful when telling an interviewer they are wrong. Pretty much the only time it's ok is a case like this where their observation of something that happened may not be complete. Be sure to include an apology for leaving them in that situation of not knowing the whole story. In general I would go for the first approach, though there may be times the second approach will work. 

If the job says "require a certified ABC" and you don't have a current one, but do have an expired one, then it may be worthwhile in your cover letter to say just that: 

If it's truly your intention to do this each and every time, regardless of the topic and the amount of notice you're given, then the first time you decline you can also mention that this is part of a larger decision. For example 

For most people in the USA with a "regular" job - paying a salary, what the people in the job call a permanent job but the employers never do - you have no legal obligations whatsoever to stay in your job or to give any notice. If you want, you can just stop coming to work. You won't be paid for the days you weren't there, but so what? In fact many firms have rules about what they'll do if you just stop coming in - for example they'll assume you're taking vacation at first, and you may earn a paycheque for the first few days or weeks you're away. Eventually they will deem you to have quit. You probably won't get a great reference, but you're not going to get sued or charged with anything. Obviously, if you have a written contract that says you will do something, such as giving notice, then you must do so the first chance you get, or suffer whatever the penalty is in the contract. In this situation I would tell my new employer that there was a small chance I would need to spend 2 weeks (not paid by the new employer) working out my notice at my old employer when the furlough ended, and I would make sure the new employer was ok with it. Since most employers would rather you not work your notice, I'm quite sure if you emailed or called your boss the first day back to say you quit, they would tell you not to come in and just do the paperwork. In the absence of such a written contract you are risking two things: you might not be allowed into the building to claim any personal possessions left behind when the furlough started, and you might not have a claim for back pay. Apparently these things tend end with everyone getting paid for the time they didn't work, but if you have moved on you might not be eligible. If those don't worry you, go ahead and look for different work. I've had people that I laid off temporarily go and find new work while laid off. I understand it's one of the risks of laying them off. 

Not discriminating on the basis of something doesn't mean ignoring it. It means only considering it in the very few cases where it's relevant to the job, and if it's never relevant to the job, not considering it. Also, once a company has helped with the visa process, or hired a noncitizen who is in the country legally, that statement says that promotions, salary, and working conditions won't be affected by those things - they won't pay married people more, or assume single people can work weekends, or give better offices to citizens than to noncitizens, and so on. The fact that for some (not all) applicants citizenship may be briefly relevant during the hiring process doesn't negate the entirety of the statement. 

But if you don't volunteer that, I sure will ask you. The reason most teams hold daily meetings is that blocks like this are quite common. They used to go on for weeks and the blockers often had no idea they were blocking others. So telling someone your issue is really the whole point of the meeting. The whole "yesterday I narrowed in on the layout bugs and today I think I should have them solved" report is fairly boring. The excitement and value comes when problems in the project can be entirely averted by vital information at the right time. So take a big breath and sing out. 

You have two reasonable choices and a bad one. The first choice is to simply ignore the mocking entirely, focus on business, and pay no attention at all to their rudeness. They may come to respect you more and stop doing that. I suspect that the mocking is a way to cover their own discomfort at not being able to do well in English with you, so they may never stop. I recommend assuring yourself that this is about them, not you, and not feeling criticized over it. (I have seen time and again with sarcastic complaining people that they do it more when they feel self conscious and inadequate.) The second choice is to address it right on the spot. The minute they do something you see as mocking, such as repeating a dialect word after you've said it, or exaggerating a pronunciation difference, stop what you're talking about and say something like "should we switch back to English?" or "Do you find me hard to understand in dialect? Should I talk more slowly?" Drawing attention to what they are doing, but not confronting them and telling them to stop being rude. This may cure them of the habit, or it may not. You stay polite and pleasant throughout. The bad choice is to go to HR, your boss, or a separate one on one meeting with the offender in which the topic of the meeting is how they mock you when you speak dialect. Such things never lead to the mocking stopping. They can lead to conflict, aggression, and possibly the offender or you losing their job or being transferred away. I would save these sort of actions for deliberate aggressions that interfere with your work. This doesn't sound like what's happening to you. 

Perhaps a more intuitive person would do this without being told. That would be handy. But you can't tell Amelia to be something different. You sure can tell her to do something different, though. Since you like her, and want her to do well, you can take the time for this. If there is something she needs to do a thousand times, you can ask her to check back with you after 5 so that you can confirm her progress before she does the other 995. If there is something like HTML that she is floundering at, give her permission to get help rather than just flounder. Note that this is not micro managing where you are over her shoulder watching her and asking her what she is doing: this is her coming to you to check things with you before going too far wrong. When she makes a mistake, be sure to tell her not just "you did x and that was wrong" but also connect it to the larger patterns. Take the emails: to help her understand the rule, the larger pattern is that we don't delete any emails, whether sent, received directly, cc'ed, from a mailing list, or whatever. The other larger pattern is that she misinterpreted the word "emails" too narrowly to mean just "emails I received". Be sure to point out both "bigger picture" items. If she denies these patterns, has no idea what you're talking about, or doesn't see the connections then I would recommend you find her something she can do or fire her. I have had people working for me who couldn't see patterns I was pointing out, and pushed back and said I was wrong. I was unable to change their behaviours despite trying for far too long. 

You may need to amass a collection of first-two-sentences for this speech. Things like "This complaining about children really bothers me." "I hate hearing parents say they don't like their children." And so on. This first sentence specifically addresses and names the behaviour, saying bad things about their own children. The second sentence reinforces that your belief and philosophy is that your kids are great and you get happiness from being a parent. "Mine are great." "I wouldn't trade being a parent for anything." And so on. Then the third sentence is the call to action, announcing that you're going, asking them to change the subject, asking them to start the meeting, or whatever. Repeat until they at minimum learn not to trot out that particular conversational topic around you.
