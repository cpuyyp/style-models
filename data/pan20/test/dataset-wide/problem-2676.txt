My professor claimed in a lecture that equations such as "Force = mass x acceleration" are Platonic forms. I disagree for a few reasons: A form is non-spatiotemporal. Force is a vector, which has magnitude and direction. In mathematics, vectors describe space. Force = dp/dt. That is, it is the change in momentum per change in time. It is dependent on time. Furthermore, a force is independent of human reality. Newton's equation is dependent on the use of the Euclidean metric. But on another planet, that society could use a completely different metric. For instance, the discrete metric or the taxicab metric, which would make their equation for force completely different. He's also said some other irksome things, such as the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) is a Platonic form. I also disagree with this one. The Pythagorean Theorem depends on the acceptance of Euclid's Fifth postulate - the parallel postulate. But there is not universal agreement that our universe is best described by Euclidean geometry. There are competing geometries such as Lobachevskian geometry (geometry on a sphere) or Riemannian geometry. These are gained by taking the negation of Euclid's postulate. So I don't understand how equations such as these can be Platonic forms - that is, non-spatiotemporal ideals independent of human realities. What are your thoughts? 

In the analytic tradition, philosophical arguments consist of clearly stated premises and logically sound conclusions. Some (already noted) attempts to locate in Rand's work such specific premises and conclusions show that her positions on several important points (e.g. causation and free will) are self-contradictory and inconsistent. This makes her conclusions irrelevant to the philosophical discourse in which she appears to have been attempting to participate. So in this way, the answer to your above question is a resounding "YES!"; a lack of argumentation entails a lack of rigor in argumentation. Upon reflection, I realize that one could respond here by saying that Rand was engaged in a more Continental approach to philosophy. Consider her tendency to employ fiction to "make her point" – a strategy (as previously mentioned in another answer) employed by Sartre and Camus, among other Continentals. Reading her this way, Rand's work could be seen as having a place within some larger historical philosophical discourse. However, her well-documented ideological struggle against Marxism undermines her own argument again here; the Marxist dialectic underpins the Continental approach to philosophy. If we are to take Rand's conclusions seriously, which is to say that if we take her particular anti-Marxism to be the point she is making, then she is using the Marxist dialectic to completely disavow Marxism, thus ending the dialectic. There are two problems with this. First, her work would be little more than her bid to be the "the champion of all philosophical discourse", and second, there are still WAY too many questions left unanswered for us to stop doing philosophy. So frankly, she has written nothing particularly philosophically interesting or compelling. 

It can be constructed as the logical fallacy of Affirming the Consequent: If P then Q Q Therefore P In this case: If you are an X, then you hold belief B You hold belief B Therefore, you are an X 

For 5), you clearly need to do an ∃ Elim on the premise, and a ∀ Intro for the conclusion. For this problem, it actually does not matter in what order you do them. That is, you can either set this up like this: 

Many people regard philosophy as a bunch of bullshit, and having no wastebaskets or erasers in the philosophy department would explain why. I myself thought of philosophy that way as well .. until I actually took a course in philosophy. 

Smells like Russell's Paradox ... Anyway, yes, you totally had the right idea: proof by contradiction! And the two conditionals will contradict as long as you instantiate them with the same constant a: 

I would say Hasty Generalization still applies, although since the speaker is trying to argue against the general claim, we can call it a Hasty Refutation But yes, this argument has the further problem of being anecdotal evidence on the basis of personal experience, which means: 

I'm going to try not to step on any toes here. No matter how you slice it, the content of your belief is almost undoubtedly not the "resulting distribution" of a "credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." It's easy to see why it can't be: when someone asks you if you believe A or B, your answer will never be "the resulting distribution of a credence-distribution over the two hypotheses." That may describe how you came to hold the belief you hold, but that process is not the content of that belief. 

Ockham's Razor is a maxim. Maxims are succinct principles or rules that are used to guide actions. The razor guides us to prefer the theory (or theories) that posit(s) the least total number of entities while satisfactorily explaining the phenomena in question over theories that explain the same phenomenon but posit more entities. As the razor's Wikipedia article says: 

This highlights another frustration some academic philosophers might have regarding Ayn Rand. She relies on absolute self-certainty where she should be relying on well-reasoned arguments. One problem here is doing this often resembles well-thought-out, consistent philosophy, but in terms of actual philosophy, it amounts to nothing more than polemics and screeds. From her writings, all that can be logically deduced are her opinions, yet I have no doubt that Rand dislikes Marxism, nor do I doubt her love of Capitalism. Another problem is that assuming the certainty of your conclusions is simply poorly-executed philosophy – every philosopher must be willing to accept that they could be wrong about their conclusions, or else they are not doing philosophy. Again, her work is thus philosophically uninteresting. But if your thoughts are provoked by her writing, that's a good thing. I recommend taking some time to sketch out her arguments and see for yourself if her conclusions actually follow from her premises. 

Yes. We can use the following basic equivalence principles: Prenex Laws: P ⇒ (∀y)(Qy) = (∀y)(P ⇒ Qy) (assuming P does not contain any y's as a free variable) Swapping Quantifiers of Same Type: (∀x)(∀y)F = (∀y)(∀x)F (works for any formula F) Replacing Variables: (∀x)F(x) = (∀y)F(y) Exportation: P ⇒ (Q ⇒ R) = (P∧Q)⇒R So: (∀x)(Ax⇒(∀y)(By⇒Cxy))= (Prenex) (∀x)(∀y)(Ax⇒(By⇒Cxy))= (Exportation) (∀x)(∀y)((Ax∧By)⇒Cxy)= (Commutation) (∀x)(∀y)((By∧Ax)⇒Cxy)= (Exportation) (∀x)(∀y)(By⇒(Ax⇒Cxy))= (Swapping Quantifiers of Same Type) (∀y)(∀x)(By⇒(Ax⇒Cxy))= (Replacing variables) (∀z)(∀x)(Bz⇒(Ax⇒Cxz))= (Replacing variables) (∀z)(∀y)(Bz⇒(Ay⇒Cyz))= (Replacing variables) (∀x)(∀y)(Bx⇒(Ay⇒Cyx))= (Prenex) (∀x)(Bx⇒(∀y)(Ay⇒Cyx)) 

I would say it is an argument. The claim that the computer analogy will turn out to be quint is a controversial claim, an the author is trying to garner support for it by pointing to past analogies, saying that what they all have in common is the comparison to whatever the latest gizmo is. The argument is thus an inductive argument: Given that several times in the past we have compared the mind to the latest gizmo at that time, only to be shown wrong at some later time, we conclude that the same thing will happen to the latest comparison (which is with a computer). As premises, you can take each of the past comparisons (telephone, telegraph, hydraulic machines, catapult), and you can have them either directly go to the conclusion (computer analogy will be wrong too), or have an intermediate result: "the mind will always (mistakenly) be compared to latest gizmo", and then draw the conclusion (computer analogy will be wrong too) from there 

Why, from my admittedly limited exposure to western philosopher, to we place such prominence on arguing for the Christian god's existence or non-existence? Where did the idea that if there is a god, then it must be good come from, aside from the Bible? 

I'm reading "The Free Will Defense" by Alvin Plantinga and he makes the comment that Martin Luther and Descartes thought that God's power is unlimited even by the laws of logic. He doesn't further explain their position or give a reference. Could someone either point me to where I can learn more about this view on God's omnipotence, or perhaps explain their view? 

Whenever I read philosophy throughout history regarding God, I notice something I have issue with: Philosophers in most cases define god to be omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-benevolent. The first two conditions are obvious: I can see where being all-powerful and all-knowing would be necessary conditions for a God. But why is it necessary that God be omni-benevolent? Of course the Christian god must be omni-benevolent, but then why do philosophers almost exclusively focus on the Christian god? For instance, the problem of evil is that it seems like omni-benevolence, omniscience, and omnipotence are incompatible with evil in the world. But again, why are we assuming God to be all good? A very simple solution to me is that: There may be a God, but he may not be good. Do philosophers ever argue that position? So I guess my question is: 

First, I agree with the claim stated in the currently most upvoted answer that the natural sciences do not prove things in the way that the formal sciences, like logic, math, and computer science, prove things, and that the natural sciences cannot give us 100% certainty. However, as an answer to the OP I think the answer falls a bit short. As I see it, we can easily take the use of the word 'proof' in the question to mean the word 'proof' as when in court we 'prove' that someone is guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Indeed, I would say that scientists use the phrase 'scientific proof' in exactly that way, i.e. as 'demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt' rather than '100% certain'. So, interpreted that way, I think the OP question still stands and is a very reasonable question: does it make sense to use science to try and 'prove' the existence of God in that sense of the word? Indeed, can we use science to obtain any kind of evidence at all? Well, as others have pointed out, much depends on how one defines God. Certainly for some concepts of God it seems that science just won't be able to find any evidence; I am thinking of the kind of God who created the world but otherwise just sits back and watches from a distance as we are steadily fouling up the planet God so kindly provided for us. However, if the God we pick has causal effects on the observable world on a more day-to-day basis, then it seems we might be able to use science to convince us that there is really 'something akin to a God' out there. For example, if, as the aforementioned answer imagines, God indeed comes in every Saturday at NIST HQ riding his light-beam, well, then we can use science to try and see if there is indeed some genuine object there, or if maybe the people observing this are suffering from some kind of mass hallucination. Now, of course, we have to be very careful here: if we find that the cup of coffee pops out of nowhere, well, that's pretty weird, and demands an explanation ... but I am not sure if that should convince us that this was due to the 'God' we had in mind, as opposed to something else. Indeed, if being 'a really, really, really, good being (and pretty powerful, to boot)' is part of how we define God, then frankly, producing coffee doesn't really impress me much, but I would be a good bit more convinced if this being snaps their fingers and all cases of bone cancer in children would disappear (apologies to Stephen Fry). So, depending on how you define God, I think that yes, science could potentially find evidence of such a God, and maybe even 'prove' its existence beyond reasonable doubt. Finally, let's be clear that science should of course not be in the business of trying-to-prove-God, but rather (assuming we find this to be a worthwhile pursuit at all) it should be in the business of testing-to-see-if-there-is-a-God. Indeed, in that sense, the original sense of the word 'proof', which was much closer to 'test', may in fact be the best of them all in the context of this question. 

This is the case because Rand offered very few philosophical arguments. I actually do not know of any particular arguments she did offer, but I will assume that she at least attempted to offer some. 

The razor hasn't been appropriately deployed here. Where you say "simpler one" you really mean that the razor would have you pick between hypotheses A and B in virtue of the number of explanatory posits they individually put forth. Specifically, if there are more explanatory posits in A than in B, and A and B both satisfactorily explain all of the relevant observations, then B is simpler than A. 

Here you've given some great examples of when to use Ockham's Razor because you've invoked explanatory posits that unduly complicate a reasonable analysis of the applicability of Ockham's Razor. Questioning Ockham's Razor means questioning the role of theoretical simplicity and the number of proffered explanatory posits. The only problems you bring up with the razor are borne of "credence distributions." What exactly are credence distributions? No matter what your answer is, they will also be explanatory posits of your theory. By definition, more explanatory posits makes your theory more complicated. In principle there's no reason you can't bring new explanatory posits into a theory, but as the Ockham's Razor wikipedia article says, they must offer some explanatory power. Including "credence distributions" in your theory doesn't seem to explain any more than a theory without them, and in fact seems to create problems where there were none. 

Of course we want to say that memory is the thing we remember with, rather than forget with. But, I think you see the point: if we didn't have any memory in the first place, then how can we forget anything at all? I am not sure how the quote is related to the point of the passage though ... 

For b): Assuming you cannot have an empty domain (otherwise, all sentences would be vacuously true, and thus true in a finite domain after all), you need at least one object. This object needs to relate to something, but that something cannot be itself, so you need a second object b. b needs to relate to something as well, but that cannot be b itself, and also not a, otherwise by transitivity b relates to b after all. So, b needs to relate to an object c. Etc. And to make that 'Etc.' a little more hard: Note that any model can never have a cycle of aRb, bRc, cRd, ... yRz, zRa, for once you have such a cycle, then by transitivity, all opjects in that cycle end up relating to each other, including themselves, thus contradicting irreflexivity. But if there is no cycle in your structure, then it is possible to 'line' up all objects from 'left' to 'right', such that any R relation goes from 'left' to 'right' as well. But with a finite number of objects, that means that you end up with a 'rightmost' element ... which therefore does not relate to anything, and that contradicts the ∀x∃yRxy So, you can indeed not have any finite model For c) No, you can't just negate the statement to force a finite model. We showed that in order to satisfy the sentences, we need an infinite domain, but all that that means is that in a finite domain, the negation of the statement is indeed true. However, that does not rule out having infinite domains where the negation is also true. Indeed, it is easy to create an infinite model of the negation: just have infinitely many objects, and have them all relate to each other (i.e. define R to be reflexive)
