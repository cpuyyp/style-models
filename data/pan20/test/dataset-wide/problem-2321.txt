After the most recent edit showed that some of my hare-brained schemes wouldn't work I cooked up another. What you can do is get a tall jack like a Hi-Lift that you can attach a sling to wrap around a pontoon. Additionally get a bunch of 4 inch ABS pipe (the black plastic pipe) that is cut to extend about 4 inches on each side of a single pontoon (roughly 16 to 20 inches). The idea is you jack up the boat and stick pipes under the pontoon. If the pipes will roll then it will be easy to push the boat into the water. If the pipes don't roll then it will offer a low friction surface that will make it easier than fighting the mud. 

What this means is you don't have to lift up the toe tab to lock in your toe manually. Racers should appreciate this because it will save a little bit of time when stepping into the skis. That being said I doubt this will be the difference that wins a race. People will engage this lock for two reasons. The most common reason and the only official reason to engage the lock is to reduce the chance of the toe binding popping free while skinning. The alternate and not manufacturer approved reason is to increase the DIN of the bindings. 

The pack won't be messed with by animals (bears, mice, racoons, etc.) who want to eat your tasty food. It will be a minor deterrent to two-legged predators if your rope is thin and an inconspicuous color like olive drab 550 cord because it is harder to see a thin rope than a pack on the ground. 

They also say that there are after market triggers that can break cleanly at 2 oz, but most stock triggers won't function well below 3 lbs. As far as whether a lighter trigger pull will improve your accuracy that depends. According to a forum M16 triggers are set to 8.5 lbs, and I've personally fired them accurately with iron sights at 500 yards. I'm not a terrible shot but I'm not exceptional either. I bring this up to point out that your estimated pull weight of 7 to 8 lbs isn't outrageous. As this article written from a concealed carry pistol point of view points out a very heavy trigger pull can negatively impact your accuracy. They specifically mention double action pistols with a 13 lb first pull and special police Glocks with a 12 lb pull as very difficult to shoot accurately. They suggest a range of 4 to 6 lbs for your trigger weight which correlates well with the Field and Stream recommendation of 4 to 5 lbs. Honestly what concerns me more is you saying the trigger doesn't break cleanly. I feel like you should probably let a gunsmith investigate that, and while they have the firearm ask them what they think about the current pull weight. 

The list goes on and on. People have been cooking all kinds of food over an open fire without a grill for centuries upon centuries. You can too with a bit of creativity. 

IMO you should probably go with a split-fin since your main concern is saving energy. They offer the least amount of resistance and let you go slow to medium speeds pretty easily. They are also more pleasant to kick IMO than a more traditional long rectangle flexible fin. The split-fins I have look similar to these: 

Of course this is rather new technology and it would be hard to find support in the form of replacement parts on in an isolated island port. Apart from the maintenance burden that would impose what are the primary drawbacks to adopting this style of boat for long-term bluewater cruising? 

Other people have addressed several concerns that I would have bringing a young child into the mountains during the winter. One concern that I haven't seen addressed is; what if something happens to you because the average 6 year old is going to be entirely dependent on you. If you become compromised for any reason the child more than likely isn't going to be able help you or fend for themselves effectively. While it is certainly true that accidents can happen anytime of the year, winter is unquestionably more risky. If you're going to take a 6 year old into the mountains in the winter apart from all the other precautions that people mentioned I'd highly recommend that you don't take the child without them being able to do the following things efficiently in storm/adverse conditions: 

As an aside I don't know where you're going but a sat phone seems overkill in all but an expedition type setting. If you really feel like you need sat phone type capabilities for a rescue then I'd highly recommend you look at an emergency beacon instead. They'll be cheaper, smaller, lighter, and optimized for your specific use case. My dad uses this one when he goes backcountry skiing alone and likes it very much. Luckily he's never needed to use it. 

Depending on how your buckle is broken you might be able to rethread it in a way that allows it to still function. More details on how it is broken might be useful. 

I have a North Face Big Shot backpack that I purchased around 2003. It was a great general purpose backpack that I used for day hikes, rock climbing, and traveling. Unfortunately time and the abuse I've inflicted on the pack have taken their toll and the pack needed to be replaced. I've replaced it with a REI Trail 40 pack since I didn't like the current evolution of the North Face Big Shot pack. I'm curious if I've gained or lost any space with my replacement pack. While I know I can try to cram as much stuff into both packs to see if one pack fits more, I'd prefer to have something more quantifiable than an "X shirt increase." So what is the best way to get a proper volume measurement on an old pack? I tried to google the older pack but I kept finding newer versions of my pack. The different newer versions all hovered around 2,000 cubic inches, which is quite a bit smaller than the 3,000 cubic inch volume I seem to recall. My memory isn't perfect though so maybe my old pack really is smaller than I recall. 

I'm not sure why my YouTube link isn't one boxing. If someone knows how to make it do that I'd appreciate the edit. 

Backpacking stoves are pressurized All of the backpacking stoves I've used use some sort of pressurized fuel system. This means that the ambient air pressure isn't going to affect the flow of the fuel. Fuel Boiling an egg on the top of Everest is a logical endeavor to persue. Carrying enough wood to the top of Everest to light a camp fire so you can make s'mores while the egg is boiling is pushing the bounds of reason. :) Kerosene is a pretty common heating oil, and it used to be a pretty common cooking fuel so let's use that instead. Keep in mind you probably want to buy your kerosene at home. Kerosene at the best of times is pretty dirty. Since kerosene has a boiling point between 150o and 300o C I'm going to assume it will remain liquid on Everest. Kerosene's pour point is between -40o and -47o C depending on grade so you'll need to make sure the fuel bottle is kept above that temperature which isn't unreasonable. Propane or natural gas should work as well. It might even be helpful that they are gases. The wind This can be blocked/mitigated by huddling around the stove with your fellow climbers, and strategically placing your packs. Alternatively you can bring up a specially fabricated aluminum enclosure for your stove/fuel/pot system. If you're determined enough to boil your egg then the extra weight shouldn't be a problem The oxygen I don't have number handy but I'm pretty sure you can get an anemic flame going on the top of Everest. If that isn't enough to boil the water fast enough you can always co-opt your friend's oxygen tank to enrich the oxygen concentration. This will be easy to do if you bring the aluminum enclosure I mentioned above. The egg This baby is going to be delicious. As Jules Verne well knew 70o C is plenty to cook an ideal boiled egg. 

In general the more stuff you have the more comfortable you can make yourself when you aren't hiking, but the less comfortable you'll be when you are hiking. This is the crux of the balancing act. If you bring a big comfy reclining "camping chair" strapped to your pack you'll be very comfortable sitting in camp but miserable when you are lugging the monstrosity around. If you bring a small square scrap of foam to sit on you'll be less comfortable in camp but much more comfortable hiking. In general it seems to me that "ultralight" sacrifices in camp comfort for hiking comfort, while "traditional light" makes small compromises to hiking comfort for in camp comfort. You should decide where you land on this spectrum and plan accordingly. Personally on a shorter distance, less arduous, and/or mini excursions from base camp type trip I tend to carry more stuff to make the camping more comfortable. When I'm doing a longer thru-hike I'll strip out the camp comforts to make the hiking more pleasant. In short I optimize for comfort wherever I'll be spending the most time. If I'm hiking with all my stuff more I'll pack less. If I'm spending more time in and around camp then I'll pack more creature comforts. The same general philosophy holds for traveling. If you're going to be on the road traveling through many third world countries over an extending time frame it is infinitely better to only bring a daypack-ish volume of stuff in a backpack. If you're going to visit family and friends for a week there is no penalty for a monstrous piece of wheeled luggage. In closing I think it is important to reevaluate your stance on learning more skills. It is my strong belief that the more you rely on things to be done for you the more you needlessly load yourself up. For example if you completely rely on a GPS unit for navigation then you really need extra batteries and most likely a second GPS unit in case your primary gets damaged. Instead if you learn to use a map and compass you have less failure modes, plus you can carry less weight AND volume. With this minor increase in your skills you've saved weight. By repeating this process your safety margins are improved without requiring increasing amounts of gear which is really the best of both worlds.
