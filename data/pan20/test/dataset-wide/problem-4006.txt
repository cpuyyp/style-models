I will start discussing the relationship between first and third definition. The key point to understand the different definitions of arithmetic Chow groups is to understand the equation $\partial \bar \partial g-\delta_Z=\omega$. In this equation appears the second order differential operator $\partial \bar \partial$. There is a cohomology theory, real Deligne-Beilinson cohomology, that contains information about the relationship between the real structure and the Hodge filtration of the cohomology of a complex manifold, where the operator $\partial \bar \partial$ appears naturally as the differential at certain degree. See "Burgos Gil, J. I.; Arithmetic Chow rings and Deligne-Beilinson cohomology. J. Algebraic Geom. 6, 2, (1997)" for a construction of a complex that computes Deligne Beilinson cohomology. It is related to the complex used by Goncharov. Thus we may write the previous equation as $d_D g -\delta_Z=\omega$ where $d_D$ is a differential in a exotic complex that computes Deligne-Beilinson cohomology. The next step is to notice that the current $g$ can always be represented by a differential form on $X\setminus |Z|$ that has logarithmic singularities along $Z$. This is proved in the original paper by Gillet and Soulé. Differential forms on $X$ with logarithmic singularities along $|Z|$ allow us to compute the cohomology of $X\setminus |Z|$ with its Hodge structure. Hence real Deligne Beilinson cohomology of $X\setminus |Z|$. From now on we assume that $g$ is the current associated to a differential form $g'$ with logarithmic singularities along $Z$. If $p$ is the codimension of $Z$, the cycle $Z$ defines a class in $H^{2p}_D(X,\mathbb{R}(p))$ (real Deligne Beilinson cohomolgy). But more preciselly defines a class in cohomology with support $H^{2p}_{|Z|,D}(X,\mathbb{R}(p))$. The class of $Z$ with support in $|Z|$ can be represented in two different ways. With the current $\delta_Z$ or with a pair of differential forms $(\omega,g')$, where $\omega$ is smooth on the whole $X$ and $g'$ is smooth on $X\setminus |Z|$ and has logarithmic singularities along $|Z|$. The condition $d_D g -\delta_Z=\omega$ is equivalent to the condition "$(\omega,g')$ represent the class of $Z$ in real Deligne-Beilinson cohomology with support on $|Z|$" A proof of this equivalence is given in Burgos Gil, J. I.; Green forms and their product. Duke Math. J. 75, 3, 529-574 (1994) Hence we have replaced a differential equation by a cohomological condition. As pointed out by Myshkin this opens the door to an abstract definition of arithmetic Chow groups: Let H be a cohomology theory that has classes with support for cycles and classes of rational functions with some compatibility conditions. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a particular choice of complexes that compute said cohomology. Then we can define arithmetic Chow groups with values in $\mathcal{C}$. The properties of the obtained arithmetic groups will depend on the properties of the complex. This abstract point of view is worked out in Burgos Gil, J. I.; Kramer, J.; Kühn, U.; Cohomological arithmetic Chow rings. J. Inst. Math. Jussieu 6, 1, 1-172 (2007). Examples: 1) Usual complex of differential forms: The obtained groups are isomorphic to the ones defined by Gillet and Soulé. 2) Differential forms with logarithmic singularities at infinity: We obtain groups with better Hodge teoretical properties. 3) Currents: The obtained arithmetic groups are fully covariant. 4) Forms with log log singularities at infinity: We obtain groups that, on one hand receive characteristic classes from certain vector bundles with singular metrics, namely the ones appearing when studying Shimura varieties. On the other hand they have well defined arithmetic degree. Thus the main motivation of the third definition is "flexibility" With respect to the second definition it is a completely different beast. The classical Chow groups has been extended by Bloch to higher Chow groups. This is the analogue at the level of cycles of the extension from $K_0$ to higher $K$-theory. The aim of Goncharov is to construct an explicit regulator from the complex of higher cycles to a complex that defines Deligne Beilinson cohomology, and then use this map to define higher arithmetic Chow groups as the cohomology of the cone of this map. He proves that the degree zero part of his construction agrees with classical arithmetic Chow groups by writing explicitely the cohomology of the cone. There are two caveats in Goncharov's definition: first it is only defined for varieties over a field, not over an arithmetic ring limiting its usefulness. This is because the theory of higher Chow groups over a ring is not well developed yet. Second there is an error in the construction. In fact the map $\mathcal{P}(n)$ in Theorem-Construction 2.3 is not a morphism of complexes. This error is solved in $URL$ 

The Young transform of nonnegative function $f(x)$, $x \in \mathbb R^n_+$ is defined to be $$ (\mathscr Yf)(y) = \inf \left[ \left. \frac{x_1 y_1 + \ldots + x_n y_n}{f(x)} \; \right|\; x \colon f(x) > 0 \right], \; y \in \mathbb R^n_+. $$ It preserves such properties as concavity, positive-homogeneity of first order, nonnegativity, continuity and arises in mathematical economics. It transforms the production function at the microlevel into the cost index of one unit of manufactured product. The problem is that I can't find anything about it in the internet. So any referencce to a book with study of this transform is very appreciated. 

Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative is a nonlocal fractional derivative that doesn't vanish in general on differentiable functions. Kolwankar-Gangal fractional derivative is local but vanishes on any differentiable function. Is there some local fractional derivative that doesn't vanish on differentiable functions in general and for which $$ D^{\alpha} x^{n \alpha} = \frac{\Gamma(n\alpha+1)}{\Gamma((n-1)\alpha+1)} x^{(n-1)\alpha} $$ holds for any $x > 0$? 

Let $\Phi(x,y,\theta)$ be a phase function defined on $X \times X \times (\mathbb R^n-0)$ where $X$ is some domain in $\mathbb R^n$, let $A(x,y,\theta)$ be an amplitude function. As usually an integral Fourier operator is defined by the formula $$ (Fu)(y)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^n} \int\limits_{\mathbb R^n}\int\limits_{X} e^{i\Phi(x,y,\theta)} A(x,y,\theta)u(x) \; dxd\theta $$ I'm currenly looking for the generalization of the integral Fourier operator on the case when $\theta$ belongs to some open convex cone $\Gamma$ in $\mathbb R^n$, for example $\Gamma = \mathop{\mathsf{int}} \mathbb R^n_+$: $$ (F_{\Gamma}u)(y) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^n} \int\limits_{\Gamma}\int\limits_{X} e^{i\Phi(x,y,\theta)} A(x,y,\theta)u(x) \; dxd\theta $$ At first I thought that this "little" modification of definition will not sufficiently affect ideas of proofs of some results in theory of integral Fourier operators and I can easily modify them. But it was a mistake. So my question is if there are some results on this generalization yet? An example of arising problem is further. I have an operator $$ (Au)(y)= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^n} \int\limits_{\mathbb R^n_+} \int\limits_{\mathbb R^n_+} e^{i \theta(x-y)+iH(x,y,\theta)} u(x) \; dx d\theta $$ where $H(x,y,\theta)$ is a function with some specific properties. I have to show that $A = I +K$, where $I$ is the identity operator, $K$ is a compact linear operator from $L^2_{0}(\mathbb R^n_+)$ to $L^2_{loc}(\mathbb R^n_+)$. If $\Gamma$ is equal to $\mathbb R^n$ then it can be done using representation $$ (Au)(y) = I + \frac{i}{(2 \pi)^n}\int\limits_{0}^{1} \int\limits_{\mathbb R^n} \int\limits_{\mathbb R^n_+} e^{i \theta(x-y) + itH(x,y,\theta)} H(x,y,\theta) u(x) \; dxd\theta $$ where $$ I = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^n} \int\limits_{\mathbb R^n} \int\limits_{X} e^{i \theta (x-y)} u(x) \; dx d\theta. $$ If we try to do tha same in the case of our "generalized" Fourier integral operator we will obtain instead $I$ in this formula an operator $$ \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^n} \int\limits_{\Gamma} \int\limits_{X} e^{i \theta(x-y)}u(x) \, dxd\theta. $$ 

The factor rings of the ordinary integers $\mathbb Z$ are the well-known residual classes $\mathbb Z_n$. For the Gaussian integers $\mathbb Z[i]$ the factor rings are studied in 1) J. T. Cross, The Euler ϕ-function in the Gaussian integers, Amer. Math. Monthly 90 (1983) 518–528. 2) Dresden, Greg(1-WLEE); Dymàček, Wayne M.(1-WLEE) Finding factors of factor rings over the Gaussian integers. Amer. Math. Monthly 112 (2005), no. 7, 602–611. There are articles on the factor rings of the ring of integers of an algebraic number field? 

Let $I, J$ be ideals in a commutative ring with identity $R$. Define the quotient ideal $(I : J)$ by $$(I : J)=\{x\in R : xJ\subseteq I\}.$$ Define the radical $r(A)$, of an ideal $A$ of $R$ by $$r(A)=\{x\in R\;:\;x^n\in A, \;\;for\;some\;n>0\}.$$ My question is: There is some link between $r[(I : J)]$ and the two radicals $r(I)$ and $r(J)$? 

I think this is not a research question, but in stackExchange remained unanswered. Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. For $n>1$ consider the full matrix ring $M_n(R)$ . For a matrix $A\in M_n(R)$ is true that the cardinality of the left annihilator (in $M_n(R)$ ) of $A$ equals the cardinality of the right annhilator? 

Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring with identity. Considere the matrix ring $A=M_n(R)$. What is the order of a maximal commutative subring of $A$ that contains all scalar matrices? 

I'm reading the papaer "On the Reduction of a Matrix to Diagonal Form" of Epstein and Flanders (Amer. Math. Monthly 62, (1955). 168–171. Let $S$ denote the trace function. The authors stated that a well-known result in the theory of algebras of matrices is: A matrix algebra $\mathbb U$ over a field $\mathbb F$ of characteristice zero is semisimples if and only if $S(XY)=0$, for fixed $X\in\mathbb U$ and all $Y\in\mathbb U$,implies $X=0$. The authors do not give references. Does anyone know where I can find a proof of this result? 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two real-analytic manifolds and $Z \subset X \times Y$ be a real-analytic embedded closed submanifold. Suppose now that $K \in \mathscr D'(X \times Y)$ is a distribution conormal to $Z$, i.e. $K \in I^m(X\times Y,Z)$ for some $m$. It defines the F.I.O. $A_K \colon C^\infty_c(X) \to \mathscr D'(Y)$ such that for any $u \in C^\infty_c(X)$, $v \in C^\infty_c(Y)$ the equality $\langle A_K u, v\rangle = \langle K, u \otimes v \rangle$ holds. If $\dot N^\ast Z \subset \dot T^\ast X \times \dot T^\ast Y$ (dot means the zero section removed) then $A_K \colon C^\infty_c(X) \to C^\infty(|\Lambda|Y)$ and we can extend $A_K$ to $A_K \colon \mathscr E'(X) \to \mathscr D'(Y)$. I would like to estimate the analytical wavefront set $WF_A(u)$ of $u \in \mathscr E'(X)$ given $WF_A(A_Ku)$. Please tell me, are there some related results in literature? UPD. I have realized that I don't have a good answer even in the case of the ordinary $C^\infty$ wavefront set $WF$. Suppose that $A_K$ is proper (hence it maps $\mathscr E'(X) \to \mathscr E'(Y))$ and suppose it has a left parametrix $B$, so that $BA - I_X$ has a $C^\infty$ kernel. Then we can write $$ WF(u) = WF(BA_Ku) \subset C^{-1} \circ WF(A_K u), \quad C = (\dot N^\ast Z)'. $$ This is the desired estimate in the case of $C^\infty$ wavefront set but according to the proof it holds for proper FIOs with left parametrixes. It is possible to say something in the case of nonproper but elliptic FIOs? Does this inclusion still hold? 

Let $f \colon \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2$ be a function from the Schwartz class and $f(0) \neq 0$. Define it's projection $g(x) = \langle f(x), \frac{x}{|x|} \rangle \frac{x}{|x|}$, where $\langle a, b\rangle = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2$, $a = (a_1,a_2)$, $b=(b_1,b_2)$. Then $g$ has the same rate of decay at infinity as $f$ but it has discontinuity at zero of special kind. By the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma we conclude that $\hat g(\xi) \to 0$ as $\xi \to \infty$, where $$ \hat g(\xi) = \int\limits_{\mathbb R^2} e^{- i \langle \xi, x \rangle} g(x) \, dx $$ is the Fourier transform of $g$. Is it possible to find an estimation of the decay rate of $\hat g$ in this particular case? Is it possible, for example, to say that for some small $\varepsilon > 0$ we have $(1+|\xi|^2)^{\frac \varepsilon 2} \hat g(\xi) \in L_1(\mathbb R^2)$? I've tried to find the answer in literature on the Fourier transform and to ask on MSE but without success.
