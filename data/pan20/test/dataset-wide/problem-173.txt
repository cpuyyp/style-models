In this sort of situation then what you should do is first define a template, the baseline. You might use this as one tribe or never show it at all but that is the starting point for all your tribes. For example: 

The answer is both yes and no. We know of no life forms that do not use proteins in some way so we cannot definitively answer that it is possible. However there are a lot of universe out there and a lot of complex reactions possible. If other lifeforms did evolve then they may use something completely new - although they will need something that does the job of DNA and proteins even if it does it in a different way. Note that life not even based on carbon has been suggested, for example Silicon based life forms. Again we don't know for sure what is possible but the chances that our way is the only way are fairly slim. 

The only way this can happen is if there is a link between the two planets. The easiest way to explain that is an alien transplanting a group from one planet to the other for whatever reason. The link would need to be relatively recent too, if you transplanted Homo Erectus for example then you might get the "dwarves vs elves" scenario. If you transplanted something further back though then the odds of them being even remotely human are pretty slim. 

Realistically I would expect that over the next ten to twenty years such implants will start to become more and more common, initially used to treat disabilities and illness. Once they are tested and in regular use for medical reasons it will start to become more and more feasible to use them for more and more minor usages. 

Imagine a planet where a sentient race is evolving, but rather than evolving hands like primates they evolve a single trunk like an elephant. They have a single flexible and strong manipulator which can wrap around things and with ends that are capable of fine motor control and act like a pair of fingers or lips opposed to each other. How would this difference in physical form change the evolution of tools as they move through the early stages from the stone age through to early metal ages? Once they become advanced to a level similar to our own then the difference in manipulators would make less of a difference, but for early tools the difference could be huge. 

Most FTL travel basically has the planet remain stationary in a bubble of space and then moves that bubble at FTL speeds through real space. In this case the effects on the planet would be the same as for any other spacecraft - whatever the effects of the drive might be. The main additional consequence though is that you have moved away from your star. Gravity would keep your atmosphere in place but you would have immediate night that never ends. Temperatures would start dropping quite fast and keep dropping, I've not done the maths but I expect the surface would start freezing within weeks although it would take time for the freeze to spread and geothermal activity would slow it in some places. You also need to consider two more things, the first is the effect on the system the planet is removed from. Orbits could well be distorted or changed. For example depending on where it was in its cycle around us our Moon could well swing away from it's current orbit and go rogue were the Earth to disappear. The second is the inertia of the planet. You put it into FTL with a certain velocity. When it emerges from FTL then does it keep that same velocity? If not what happens to it? You will somehow need to synchronize the velocity of the planet with a suitable orbital velocity for its new position. One way around this might be to use the FTL drive to place you in a suitable place next to a gas giant and let the giant's gravity accelerate you. By pulsing the FTL drive to remain in the right place you could achieve a constant acceleration until the required velocity is achieved. As a side note this could potentially be weaponized. It was suggested in E.E. Doc Smith's Lensman series that they could find two planets that at some point in their orbit had opposed directions. They attached FTL drives to both planets and then moved them into positions each side of the target and turned off the FTL drives at the same time, causing the two moved planets to pancake the target's planet between them, overwhelming all that planets defense systems completely. 

A major scientific breakthrough can be expected to happen reasonably soon. The thing is though, with virtually all breakthroughs they have not been anything we could expect ahead of time. The sheer power available in nuclear reactions was inconceivably before Einstein. In fact there was debate about how the sun could have managed to burn for so long as no chemical reaction could provide enough energy for long enough. The nature of machines that are powered by steam was equally impossible to imagine in a world where water and wind mills were the main sources of mechanical energy. The people first working on early computers would have no way of comprehending the possibilities of the Internet and the world wide web. I have a mobile phone in my pocket more powerful than any computer in the world 20 years ago, that can browse the internet wirelessly, generate 3d images, and far far more. So we can expect to see scientific breakthroughs within our lifetime. But if they are true breakthroughs then only a very few people will have seen them coming before they do. 

Actually while the title of your question asks for an enormous crater, the body is asking for something completely different - a ring of islands. That could be explained by a couple of means that do not involve craters at all - both of these start in a planet entirely covered by water, but not too deep water. Ring of Fire A "hot spot" in the magma of the planet causes volcanoes to form above it, over time that hot spot moves around in a circle driven by Coriolis forces within the magma, as it does a line of islands appears above it as volcanoes punch up from the sea bed and into the surface. When first formed you would get tall active volcanoes, these would then gradually erode down as the hot spot moved on until millions of years later the hot spot returned and built them up again, so you would have a ring of gradually eroding islands "behind" the active one. Organisms A hypothetical corral species proves very successful and builds its way all the way up to the surface and then starts expanding outwards. As it moves out the old coral starts to erode and collapse back down. The growth of the coral absorbs certain nutrients from the sea shore so it always keeps expanding outwards in a ring. Natural events, valleys in the sea floor, variation in the mineral, etc mean that breaks form in the ring as it expands leaving the situation after millions of years of a ring of islands with empty sea both inside and outside of the ring. 

There are a number of advantages the Golems have over both infantry and vehicles. The first is that they can wait silent and immobile for a long time, they have no need to breathe or eat. They are also strong and tough, although not as strong or as tough individually as a tank. They would be essentially impervious to most small arms fire, heavier weaponry would be needed to shut them down. You need to use these advantages rather than trying to engage head-on. Terrorize the enemy, make them dread every step. Statues This is quite simple, replace some statues with Golems and wait. On a suitable symbol the statues come to life and attack. This gives an instant fear and confusion factor, and with the Golem being in the middle of your troops using heavy weapons on them will cause a lot of collatoral damage. Underwater Streams and rivers allow the Golems to move around undetected and strike from unexpected angles. Underground Bury a golem into the ground on a street with a big stack of remote-controlled explosives. It remains quiet and hidden until a vehicle passes over, at that point its arm comes out and attaches a pack of remote-controlled explosives to the vehicle. It then goes quiet again until the next vehicle passes and then repeats the process. Darkness Golem's don't seem to "see" in a conventional sense. They may well be able to operate at full effectiveness even in pitch black or smoke. They could be used for night attacks, or use smoke grenades to obscure vision. Gas Golem's don't breathe, equip the Golems with dangerous chemicals that produce poison gas, have them throw it and walk through it. Fire Golem's are fireproof, equip the Golems with flamethrowers and also wrap them in rags soaked in oil that ignites when they set off the flamethrowers. Underground and fire Bury golems under likely camping spots for the invasion forces. They would be completely still and silent so essentially undetectable if placed well. At a suitable time in the night they would rise up and find high value stores. They would set light to those stores then bury back underground under the burning supplies and hide themselves under the ashes. The course of the invasion It starts immediately as the army advances, strange figures striking in the night and then disappearing again. Soon the men are afraid to go near water as the enemy special forces are lurking in the streams and rivers waiting to attack. You camp for the night and your supplies go up in flames, but there are no signs of any attackers. Suspicion turns on your own men and the guards on duty that night are shot for dereliction of duty, but the next night the same thing happens again. As the convoy approaches the town there is no sign of resistance, no enemy fire, but suddenly the leading 6 APCs in the convoy explode from beneath. A thorough search finds no attackers in the area but there are remains of an explosive device found attached to the bottom of each vehicle. Again suspicion turns inwards and paranoia starts to spread. Guards are posted on the remaining vehicles overnight and supply depot guards are doubled. The next day though despite all these precautions the remaining APCs also explode, again with devices attached underneath. The remaining demoralized troops sweep into the town to find the area evacuated and no sign of resistance. As they move further into the town though strange hulking figures step out of the buildings around them. The ones in front shoot out vast tongues of flame, igniting into walking nine feet tall figures of flames. From the sides comes more of the figures, these ones throwing gas and smoke grenades. Then the statues in the center of the square come to life and charge towards the leaders of the army, brushing aside fully grown men like they weigh nothing and with bullet fire bouncing off them, barely chipping their surface. The terrified men panic and turn to run but more of the hellish creatures are rising up out of the ground behind them. The panic turns into a mass stampede and they run for their lives, losing a huge number of men and all of the leaders in the process. ...and that's how 24 Golems defeat an army :)
