Little brainettes However, underlying all of this is a fundamental question that I have avoided so far: is the human race procreating? And if so, how? If not, then are the AIs we create our offspring? Where do little brains come from, and what happens to rest of the body if they are cultivated in the usual way? If brains come from humans that are grown the usual way, then you are left with the remains of that persons body as hazardous waste once the brain and spine has been removed. Taking care of that may be an extremely unpleasant job, and may thus a thankless, mentally scarring job (at the opposite end of an elite job). If brains are grown without the rest of the body, then that raises a whole lot of questions of it's own. However we can then safely say that the field of human medicin that is worth studying would be greatly diminished, thus the workload of medical students would be greatly changed. In this world, much of the mdical field concerned with the body has been supplemented or replaced with technical knowledge from other fields. (Sorry about the lack of references, unfortunately I'm not allowed more than two since I'm new. The question leaves a lot of free variables, which is why I've included a bunch of questions to consider while world-building.) 

Basically, gorillas are better for the exact opposite of what you're wanting them to do, which is fight in tight, modern, urban environments for a simple reason, they're animals and don't live or operate in these areas naturally. If you wanted melee soldiers for an older style of fighting in mountainous terrain, then they'd be great, but for this I would say no. 

Experience - you describe a scenario where you take already grown gorillas and hand wave them into being intelligent. That's all well and good if you want to educate them to show off at an academic conference, but that is a horrible idea for a soldier. What you are really doing is creating the equivalent of physically superior child soldiers because they have almost zero life experience to draw upon as soldiers. They won't know even the basics about human life and our habitats and teaching this combined with everything else that they need to know to be effective soldiers in an urban environment would take years. Otherwise they'll simply be brawny thugs shooting anything that resembles what you have qualified as a 'bad guy' and most likely being tactically outmaneuver very quickly. Cost - Human soldiers have been the focus for our infantry for thousands of years. Unless you're planning to have had these intelligent gorillas around for a long time, then nothing will have been developed over time to suit them, it will have been adapted for them, and that is a problem. You even mention creating a new kind of 'foot' wear just for these new troops, along with modifications to other equipment. That is simply the beginning, as others pointed out, because they have not evolved for acting as humans do. If this organization decides to suddenly attempt this gorilla soldier idea, then it is going to cost them a ton to get what is likely very little return out of it. 

Fundamentals of the self Given that artificial bodies and full immersion simulation is the norm, you seem to have a society like Ghost in the Shell wherein the difference between virtual and actual experiences blur together. Specifically I would direct you to the Stand Alone Complex anime (if you haven't already watched it), as it touches a wide range of the same social issues. If the brain is a normal human brain, and it receives the same set of inputs when experiencing the real world through an entirely artificial shell as when it experiences the virtual world, then it stands to reason that many people may ask what the difference is. Many may even choose to forgo the use of an artificial body completely, as the maintainance costs may be prohibitive. Compare this with the cost of owning a car: 

So overall it's potentially a hassle to even have a body, so if someone could offer you hosting for your brain and spine with a good connection to a general purpose informational exchange network (read Internet) where people can share a virual environment, then that may be preferable to a large group of people. For a real-world example of this, look at how many people and companies are choosing to forgo in-house hosting of web-sites and the like, instead choosing to hand hosting over to dedicated providers. Society: You, me and everybody Of course this also requires that the potential clients trusts the hosting company absolutely, since they have no way protecting or defending themselves in the real world and no way to walk away from the company if they were dissatisfied (if the company won't let them). This leads to a potentially abusive relationship: any company or organization dealing in artificial bodies or conciousness hosting (shells) would hold a lot of power over the individual. This leads to a divergence in the way you might want to handle the society: 

I recommend that you take a look into Esperanto. It is a language that was an actual real-life attempt to create almost exactly what you are describing. It uses the Latin/Roman script popular to most of the Western European languages as well as English and utilizes a vocabulary similar to that of the Romantic and Germanic languages. It is said to be easier to learn than English and has actually been growing in popularity and usage for the past few decades. This answers the first part of your question. $URL$ For the second part, I think the best way for the government to try and institute a change would be through passive action. By simply making all communication with them use the new language, they are basically forcing you to learn it to some degree. Unfortunately, in answer to your third question, as you will discover, it is very difficult to get people to give up their language as that is a very core and defining part of who we are. Even if the government demands it, you still end up with people simply adopting the new language as a secondary to their own. Short of taking a very aggressive approach and simply squashing all resistance, it is unlikely that real change will happen. History says that you will more likely experience revolution and resistance from the nation's citizens. 

This affects what jobs might be available and what they entail, but since "what would elite jobs be like" is part of the question, I will assume that society operates in an hierarchical fashion and that social advancement along with accumulation of monetary wealth are core goals for the individual. Enjoying yourself is also a goal, and a part of that is meaningful occupation (at work and in your free time). Jobs in Utopia Physical labor can often be left to non-sentient, necessarily intelligent AIs manning specialized (see industrial robots) or generalized bodies. A human touch may be required if the situation is unpredictable, or if there is the need to have someone take on the responsibility in case of failure. This is assuming that there is enough robotic bodies to go around, But since "androids are running the streets" I feel that it is not unfair. More cerebral jobs would be the go-to for humans and human-level AI under this society. It brings up the further question of how to define the abilities and inadequacies of AI with human-level intelligence. This is a part where you might want to take a few liberties, since the best example of a high-profile AI with something approaching human-like intuition would be IBM's Watson. To continue talking about jobs, this also means that a huge segment of the job-market as we know it today disappears. With no "menial" or repetitive work, that only leaves creative and administrative work (e.g. I'd classify being a CEO as a comibination of creativity and administration), along with any other position that requires someone to hold responsibility. This is usually what we consider elite jobs today, so assuming that the majority of people have work like this we'd probably push the difinition to cover the upper echelons of such work: jobs with the most freedom, the most power and (possibly) the most responsibility. Some jobs that might exist:
