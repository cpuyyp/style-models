I need a meteor to deliver an extraterrestrial algae-like cellular life form to an urban environment/city. 

My world is largely based around the production and consumption of 'drugs', chemicals which have physiological affects. Given the variety of drugs in the world, I am looking for alternate ways of consuming them. There are the standard ways, of course: smoking, snorting, suppositories, oral consumption. I am looking for more 'creative' ways of drug intake, with the reasons for why they must be taken this way. Ex: eye drops. Reason: the chemical is too potent to be swallowed/dropped on the tongue, so absorbing it through the eyes is slow enough to avoid the negative affects of an overdose which would come from the rapid oral absorption to be used at all. Ex: skin patches. Reason: the chemical is produced on a certain sort of material as a catalyst and cannot be separated from it after the fact, requiring the use of cutting the material into strips and placing on the skin. 

The book Permutation City by Greg Egan explores this concept exactly; the emergence of an intelligent species from within a 3-dimensional cellular automata, evolved over a large time-span. If you are interested in this question, Egan explores it in-depth over the course of the novel. The prose is suprisngly good for an amateur writer, but the concepts explored and thought experiments involved are fascinating. As mentioned, and similarly to the perspective taken in the book, human observers look for signs of intelligence by observing the symbolic interactions between entities; once they deciphered their "language", the analysis of the complexity and semantics of the language was used to determine whether the species could be considered "intelligent"; i.e. discussing highly abstract concepts, such as mathematics. 

The meteor needs to be far enough that it will not impact the Earth and will not cause sufficient alarm. The meteor needs to be inconspicuous enough that a city would not be evacuated upon approach (in particular, it would be better if it was undetected until it entered the atmosphere, but I don't know if that's feasible), but it still would cause extensive damage (such as with the Chelyabinsk meteor). The meteor needs to deliver several large chunks capable of destroying/damaging buildings and many smaller chunks over the city. 

I am tired and don't want to get into all the gory details (but find the topic terribly interesting). Scientists felt they could focus about 80% of the destructive power of the bomb. That still leaves 20% of a nuclear bomb to annihilate everything else not in path of the directed shot. Within some (very short) distance of the bomb, the gamma rays and neutrons are powerful enough to cause transmutation (fission & fusion reactions). All chemical bonds will be broken all atoms will be ionized (possibly multiple times). Within a longer (but still short) distance of the bomb, the heat caused by absorbed gamma rays and neutrons will ensure most chemical bonds are broken and many atoms are ionized (but no nuclear shenanigans will be going on). In an atmosphere these two zones combine and form the fireball region which absorbs most gammas, causing the air to heat and generate the blast wave. In space, the gammas just keep going and kill people directly. Regardless of the direction of the blast, the bomb will spew neutrons about. Neutrons are not stopped very well by most shielding (it's better to use large quantities of water to shield you instead of dense metals, for instance). Neutrons will kill people so even if infrastructure survives the 20% of the bomb that escapes the directed blast, the nearby people will die anyway. Kinetic Projectiles I want to throw one final thought out there. You could do it with a hypersonic kinetic projectile. If shot from space, it would look like a shaft of light shot down from the sky and simply left a crater where the offensive tidbits were left. The blast from any bombardment which creates a crater will also damage the things around the crater rim. But this sort of strike does not cause radiation damage (but does cause a blast). Kinetic weapons scale better than conventional or nuclear weapons. They can be as small as a .22 bullet to as large as the dinosaur killing asteroid (~6 miles in diameter). You can also adjust the speed of the projectile. Kinetic projectiles have the added benefit of not emitting lethal radiation, so if you survive the impact and subsequent blast, you'll survive the encounter. This a video of the meteor that fell over Russia. Imagine a targeted strike intended to take out a building. It would damage nearby buildings but leave most of the city untouched (sans windows, of course). Video of meteor over Russia 

Depends on how "soft" you are making the sci-fi. The bottom of the carpet is lined with (as yet undiscovered in real life) particles which repel each other almost like quantum springs when exposed to... I don't know, oxygen? Before the flight, the carpet needs to be placed into an extremely powerful compressor which squeezes them together and stores up the energy. Then the repulsive action causes thousands of individual little "jumps" between the particles, which forces the carpet to rise from the ground. Here's the hard part: Control. Using a complex system of threads weaved within the carpet, the shape underneath can be changed, making subtle little bends and folds which can increase and reduce the repulsive force in different sections by activating more or less of the particles. In the hands of someone of great skill, this technique can actually be used to direct and steer different parts of the carpet. Now, about flying throughout the "Seven Seas" (i.e. the entire world), it could be that a number of linings of the stuff would be needed, so pilot might need to have a way of removing a layer of it, mid flight. You'd also have to have a special airtight cover to land on, so that when you got off, the carpet didn't fly off uncontrolled. 

Perhaps we are a remote tribal agrarian society who never had access to technology anyway (like the ones that actually currently exist) and are happy that way. We use the magic to greatly improve our lives, but just don't care enough about the outside world to buy into the whole industrial culture. Our magic is less powerful than currently available technology, so we don't necessarily have big businessmen coming to exploit us for its use, but it provides everything we in particular need or want. At the same time, our monetary resources are poor and population relatively low, so we don't have big businessmen coming to sell us their technology with any great enthusiasm. So the only visitors we get from the outside world are hippies who are trying to prove to themselves that our way is superior and the odd documentary maker. Both groups of people make us feel very good about our way of life and we see little technology and have no need to change. e.g. the hippies tell us all about the noisy, dirty cities where people are starving and exploited by cruel mega-corporations, and well why would we want technology if that's what it brings? And we do get to see all the impressive camera equipment belonging to the documentary-makers, but they are no better than our crystal balls, and we don't need all those big electricity generators, wires, etc. hanging off them.

During the Dark Ages, the Church acted as a repository of knowledge. Nearly every book in Europe saved from prior ages was saved in a Church or monastery. 

Cost How much might it cost to redirect comets to strike Mars and increase its volatiles inventory? Hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars? Even the "richest" entity capable of running a project like this on Earth (the US Government) would find it difficult to finance such a goal. Give the time horizon mentioned below, it would be exceedingly difficult for other organizations to justify the risk. The current cost combine with the risk would not be worth the distant reward. Even when you ask questions like "how much might a fully terraformed Mars be worth" are actually not important when the payout goes to the great x50 grandchildren of the person making the investment. Project Time Terraforming even the most Earth-like planet (e.g. Mars) might take a thousand years or more. For even the most optimistic humans, this is well beyond our normal capacity to operate. We just don't think in terms of projects lasting that long. Large corporations are arguably the best at long-term planning and execution and they aren't really capable of managing projects beyond a time-horizon of 10-20 years. By comparison, elected governments may plan for 10-20 year time frames by have problems with execution follow-through when elections replace the original planners. After all the people reaping the rewards won't be born for more 50 generations. I suspect we won't see serious discussion of massive/costly Terraforming efforts until human life-expectancy gets to be close the length of time such an endeavor might take. Mass Passive environmental systems require much more "stuff" than the active ones. It won't make sense to use passive systems on anything intended to move around (e.g. most spacecraft) unless the mission requirements require it (e.g. a generation ship). Carrying the extra mass of the passive system would simply cost too much reaction mass to move. Of course planets & moons will be likely targets for Terraforming. However, we might see Terraforming and development of passive systems for giant space habitats (e.g. O'Neill Cylinder habitats). Interior of O'Neill Cylinder: 

Just to add a separate answer into the mix: Perhaps using magic requires energy - as much as doing manual or intellectual work. So if you ask a woman use her magic to fix your car - she may be defying the laws of physics to do it where an actual mechanic would not - but it's still work to her, and so she may not be willing, or may still charge money, or may still get it slightly wrong. She might also be forced to introduce a magical component to your car which you might not want (because then you will have to ask / hire a mage to fix it in future) It might work out just as effective to get a mechanic to do it (or even more so if it's a highly qualified mechanic) Even if he does end up using tools that are partially powered by magic (i.e. was made by a woman or team containing women). 

The obvious one is: The power to look like a cartoon character! Sure people can post you on social media, but no one will believe them! Or perhaps they have an angelic glow, and appear bright even in dark surroundings, but without casting the light onto surrounding objects. Either way, anyone who looks at it will just think it's a hideous photoshop attempt. Or if you are looking for something a little more serious, the obvious one is the power not to be photographed (like the way a vampire doesn't appear in a mirror) 

Population Decline & High Infant Mortality (e.g. because of extreme resource shortage) A society in population decline due to high infant mortality might favour girls over boys. The reason being that men can go around impregnating at will, but a woman is a lot more limited in the number of children she can bear. So the optimal number of women vs men for the purposes of continuing the future generations would require a higher number of girls to live to adulthood. 

I don't really see that you've any explaining to do! The only problem you face is in that currently in the pop-music industry, the front-man/woman is valued, and they are the product that is sold. This is a usually good-looking person with personality and a good voice who performs the songs, who people will pay money to go and see. e.g. a difficulty would arise if the writer were to put on a concert as they might have different performers for each song - logistically difficult and expensive. Therefore the performer becomes the "owner" of the song in the public's eyes at least. However with only a small change in culture, it's not at all insurmountable. Take the film industry - the leading-man or leading-lady would be like the front-man, but nowadays, the director is regarded as much as the lead actor. Pulp Fiction features Samuel L. Jackson and is directed by Quentin Tarantino - both are big names, equally associated with the film (in fact in this case the director is even more associated with it). It's all about the brand, and pop-music promoters just happen to use the performer for the brand at the moment. But if a writer were to have several successful songs "by" different performers, they could be used as the brand just as much - giving interviews, releasing albums (with different performers), and soon you would have a cultural shift just as you have with films. As for putting on concerts, well you mightn't want to have many performers at a single concert, but perhaps a tour of concerts would have different bands (e.g. local talent) play at each one. (The writer might still have to M.C. or something to show face though.) 

Basically think of all of the things you might like to do on a long vacation and this is what early retirees do. I belong to a board of early retirees (because I plan to be one) and can say that their interests and activities are as diverse as HAM radio, dulcimer competitions, hobby farms, going back for additional post-secondary education, simply reading, and more. What people do will be as diverse as there are people. The interesting thing is this. Once people achieve the ability to retire early, many do not, they continue working (for a while). Most jobs go through phases: sometimes they're enjoyable and sometimes they're not. People able to retire early typically stick with their professional jobs until they reach one of the "not enjoyable" phases. At that time, they retire because they no longer need to put up with the "bs". I've lectured at elementary schools about topics related to my profession. So I think doing something like that would be fun, or perhaps serving as a volunteer docent at a favorite museum. 

Amongst other categorizations, chemical reactions / reactants may be divided into two types: oxidizers and reducers. On our planet, the reducers are stored as ready forms of energy because oxidizers are freely available to perform the reaction. On a planet with a reducing atmosphere (e.g. a predominantly methane atmosphere), then life might store energy in the form of stable oxidizers. This stable oxidizer need not be oxygen or even provide oxygen to the reaction as the halogen gases (and other elements & compounds) also serve as oxidizers - but let's assume that this alien environment does use oxygen as its oxidizer (energy storage). Some compounds that might serve (as energy storage / oxidizer in a reducing atmosphere):

Our ancestors without modern instrumentation figured out a bunch about the Earth as soon as they developed sufficiently advanced math to calculate the Earth's shape. They did this just using logic, math, and geometry. It might have helped conceptually but I'm not sure that a ring system would have accelerated these discoveries & calculations by much.
