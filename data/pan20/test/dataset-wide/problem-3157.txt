The actual trigger point wasn't a Senate Majority (which was given up in 1850), but rather a more general sense of increasing "containment" by the South. Early in the life of the country, the slave/free balance remained even because there was land suitable for both to expand. 1848 and the War with Mexico added some land, but this land had no slaves and there was a contingent in Congress that didn't want to extend Slavery - the Free Soilers. The Compromise of 1850 kept them from extending it to California, and the rest of the land out west seemed unsuitable for large scale slave importing, it being desert and waste for the most part. Enter Kansas. By the Missouri Compromise of 1820, this was to be free soil, but the slave holding areas of Missouri were in the North, just adjacent to Kansas and didn't want free ground so close. These fellows felt surrounded, and the South tricked Douglas into allowing slavery in as "Popular Sovereignty". It just got worse when the real free soil settlers soon outnumbered the slave settlers and the Missourians who rode in to vote about 10-1, despite rigged elections and even a mini Civil War. Kansas was going to end up a free state regardless. This political disaster elevated Free Soilers (and others) into a new major party, the Republicans, dedicated to locking slavery out of any new territory. The strength of this party in the North and the fact that many Northern Democratic voters weren't interested in new slave states either meant a compromise that might result in a new slave state was out of the question going forward. In 1857, one last stab at 'escape' was made with the Dred Scott decision by the Supreme Court, which purported that Slavery could not be restricted anywhere, in the Territories nor in Free States. This absurd conclusion, which in essence tried to make the Republican Party unconstitutional and make all states slave states, assured the rupture of the Democratic Party and the win by Republicans in 1860. At that point, those fighting containment could only do it outside the US. The radicals managed to pull some states out, and then induce a war that would get nearly all the slave states to follow. They were terrified that unless it came to arms, a compromise like those in 1832 or 1850 would follow. 

It depends on what you are doing. If you line up a brigade of Cossacks versus heavy cavalry in a battle and charge both, the Cossacks would be wiped out. If you had the same brigade of each trying to control the areas around the two armies in the field, the Cossacks would run rampant over the area and the Heavies would be useless and vulnerable. 

The assumption that Philip of Macedon made radical changes seems questionable. The Macedonian sarissa was longer than the hoplite version, which would give it an advantage over a phalanx with shorter weapons. Certainly with these, and the Macedonian Cavalry, Philip managed to subdue all of Greece aside from Sparta, who also gave him little trouble. Of course, the fact that Macedon was larger than each Greek state might also give them an advantage when taking each city in isolation. The longer spear remained in use for the phalanx in subsequent wars, so there's no sign that any disadvantage versus the hopite phalanx was ever found. I'm not sure why you don't credit the phalanx when fighting the Persians. Both types showed well versus Persians, from Xenophon and his long retreat to Alexander and his long advance. Since the Persians did not have good heavy infantry, the superiority was vital when fighting large forces. But this isn't of any relevance to your question. Finally, the Legion beat the phalanx fairly handily, and it got easier with practice. By the end of the period Rome was thumping successor armies with almost no losses. But, again, there's little reason to think that a hoplite phalanx wouldn't be as easy to beat for them. 

Because the Founding Fathers screwed up. They didn't see the formation of active political parties coming. Every elector voted for 2 men for President, and the second place man became Vice President. All the Democratic-Republicans voted for Jefferson and Burr, so by law the election became a tie and was thrown in the House. from WIKI 

Probably Cardinal Talleyrand, who had been Napoleon's foreign minister and was still on his Council of State while working with the Coalition to unseat Napoleon after 1807. 

If we are leaving out the Parkinson's "diagnosis" something to consider that everyone has left out is that on July 20 1944 Hitler had nearly been killed in a bomb plot. This could have had effects on him physically and on his nerves when in basically the same situation. 

The reason no such bill was brought forward was that the sense of the country was that Congress did not have the power to do any such thing. Congress did not have the power to force the states to free slaves. It did have the power to free slaves it "its own" area of the District - with compensation, and of course it was a Republican plank that Congress had the power to limit slavery in the Federal Territories. What Congress did in 1865 was entirely different - it started the process of creating an amendment that ended Slavery. The states would have to ratify that Amendment before it took effect. Lincoln based his right to free slaves as a "War Powers" issue. He was given extended powers over the war zone as Commander in Chief. When his generals trod on the slavery question he overruled them for policy reasons rather than that of right. A general can, for example, break up a barn for wood to build a bridge for war purposes. So likewise the Commander in Chief might need to confiscate the slaves in the war area to win the war. This was the power that backed the Emancipation Proclamation. As the war drew to a close, the 13th Amendment was pushed as a way to permanently solve any issue about the relevance of the EP to a post war nation, or the justification of this use of War Powers. Once this was passed then the issue was settled constitutionally and for good. 

At the Battle of Pharsalus, Caesar used infantry to support his cavalry when faced with superior numbers: 

So if your pikemen break formation to try and worry the flanks of the Romans in the front line, then the second line troops charge on the disordered pikes and break them. If they hold formation and advance into the gaps, their flanks are open to the men in the front line if they drive off their own opponents. 

According to Google Books the book "Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations" edited by Suzy Platt says that this came from a letter to S Stanwood Menken in 1917 and was read by Roosevelt's sister to a national meeting that same year. Sounds legit.
