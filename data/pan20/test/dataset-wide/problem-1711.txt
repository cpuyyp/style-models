The thumbnail photo is not really related to the users profile as such. It is a property that was added with Exchange2010 to allow for a central, manageable repository for user pictures within outlook. As it was quickly determined that you don't want your IT department to be responsible for hundreds of user photos (you're bringing back bad memories of my first 'sysadmin' job here!) there are quite a few tools out there that allow for the users to upload their own image. This requires some minor permission tweaking in AD (nothing that could pose a security issue). You might want to google "AD photo upload". 

Seeing as how we can see that the default port is being used for the instances, the port has to come from either the or runtimes. Judging by the comments... Your best bet is to check if the ports are being used by the replica set. 

For a small company that is looking to have a server publicly accessible, it is often not easy to make sure that it is entirely safe. Your first order of business is probably to make sure that if the server is compromised, you limit the amount of risk. 

I'm trying to set up a script that generates blg files every set amount of time, using powershell. I know this can be done using perfmon XML templates, but for this specific project I have to do it with powershell if at all possible. My main issue is that I am unable to store the list of performance counters I want to use in a variable and reuse them. I've attempted to use the following script to create a list of performance counters to use: 

And from your client machine to your externally accessible machine in the same way, but replace with your VPS external address. 

then make sure you have the correct version of SSMS installed on your workstation. You can follow the steps explained in this MSDN reply about SSMS versions and SQL server Agent. Summary: 

When running logman parameter /? I came to the conclusion that the only switches that allow for the -u parameter are the update create and delete switches. My worry is that when rolling this out, I'll have problems passing the user credentials when starting querying and stopping the counters. Because remote access is going to be restricted I have to be able to pass a user that was given the correct credentials, without running my powershell session as that user. (I am not joined to the domain) Is there anything I'm missing? Perhaps regarding this conflicting documentation? 

It looks like my error is firewall related. I'm unsure why the one command () encounters the error while the older version () does not. 

Depends on the version of SQL Server and the version of Windows Server 2012. From further down the link you yourself posted. But as far as I can tell, all versions of Windows Server 2012 support all versions of SQL Server 2016. The full list as in the link above: 

We have a VNET that is coupled to an Express route, on which we will give our users access to specific subnets. These subnets are created for each resource group, and the idea is to have these users only able to add machines in their subnet. To allow users to add machines to a subnet I gave them the following permissions: 

We ended up trying to remount the databases, restart the services (SQL Server and Virtual Disk services). But in the end the only solution was a restart of the server. What happens during the VSphere Snapshot process that could cause this chain of events? If this is related to the VSphere Snapshot, why would a reboot fix it? 

What you're looking for is not necessarily restricting wp-admin to localhost, but an ip filter. This is a common solution to brute force attacks. However depending on what you're experiencing, there are many approaches. You might want to read the WordPress codex (go to Limit Access to wp-admin by IP) 

The situation I am facing is that we were in the middle of moving mailboxes from an exchange 2010 sp3 environment over to a server running exchange 2013 and the exchange 2013 server had a raid error and we lost all data on the 2013 box immediately after the migration (completely dead array, all VM's gone of course :) I am able to see the mailboxes in "soft deleted" state on the 2010 Exchange box, I have tried running microsoft's recommended command to restore the soft deleted mailboxes the command errors out indicating that user's mailbox is on the 2013 server. Unsure how to proceed and would love any pointers anyone may have. 

We used the network usb hub for a couple of VM scenarios. We also found that you can map the USB controller from the physical machine directly to the operating system (windows server 2003 in our cases). This requires figuring out exactly which hub controller is using what usb ports but it was a great workaround for software using a USB HASP key. 

Ended up using Kernel for Exchange server from Nucleus Technologies to export all the soft deleted mailboxes out to PST. Given the time constraints we had to get mail flowing it was decided to hurry up a scheduled google apps migration. While I was less than impressed with Google's import tools all in all the switch went well. Not exactly a pretty scenario but all is well in the end. 

I gave both people who responded credit for this because the actual solution was a weird one. Despite showing no errors, I narrowed the problem down to one particular model of removable Hard Drive (Seagate Freeagent 300gb GO drive). When I disabled all these devices, the problem went away on all drives. Very Weird. Reaffirms my dislike of Seagate. Thanks to all. 

I have roaming profiles set up with additional folder redirection deployed by GPO in a 2008 R2 RDS farm environment. They are working well, but files added to folder locations in the profile (such as saving a file to the desktop) only replicate to the redirected location at logout. Is there any way I can set this up so files are immediatley saved to the network location while the user is working prior to logout? My concern is that in the event of a server crash a user could lose hours of working data. Thanks in advance, any relevant info one way or the other will get a vote. 

I am having a very strange issue that I have been unable to nail down. When I send to a particular address with Outlook Web Access 2003, I get the NDR message shown below. When I email that same user the exact same email from Outlook 2007 through the same exchange server, I have no bounceback.The user's address is external to our mail server, completely different company. Reporting-MTA: dns;xxx.corp Final-Recipient: rfc822;gina@bxxx.com Action: failed Status: 5.7.1 Diagnostic-Code: smtp;554 5.7.1 The message from () with the subject of (Re: Wacom Tab/ Signature Pad) matches a profile the Internet community may consider spam. Please revise your message before resending. Does anyone have any idea what would make OWA2003 fail, yet the same message sent through the same server succeed? Thanks in Advance! -Nate 

We have been experiencing a VERY odd error and I have no idea where to go from here. When users are logging in to a Standalone Windows 2008 R2 server in workgroup configuration, it causes the following error: Event Log: System Event Source: Disk Event ID: 11 Research Severity: Error Details: The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Harddisk2\DR(number of drive varies). There are multiple USB drives plugged in, and the drive that detects the error varies. I have tried 5 different drives, and 2 thumb drives, and all will throw this error periodically. It seems to be only 1 drive at a time that will throw this error. 1)THE DRIVES HAVE ALL BEEN VERIFIED CLEAN WITH MULTIPLE CHKDSKS 2)THE MOTHERBOARD ON THE SERVER HAS BEEN REPLACED TWICE 3)Switching ports does not affect the error. As I said, the MB was also replaced 3)The issue appears EXACTLY when a user logs in Has anyone out there seen ANYTHING similar? Thanks in advance!
