Can we agree, as SF writers, to stop extrapolating this way? What possible reason is there to think that, during the centuries we develop FTL cruise ships, we won't make a single breakthrough in computer technology? Unless your ships run on diesel engines, your computers shouldn't use today's ideas either. We already have some of the equipment and techniques we need to make quantum computers. Do some research. Design a computer that fits into your setting. If it's necessary to your plot for a stasis pod to fail, find a convincing way to make it fail in context. Somebody sabotaged it. An employee at the factory got fired while assembling it and "lost" a wrench. One of the kids pressed a few buttons and accidentally started the self-destruct sequence. During the ejection process, one corner nicked a loose girder, so the stasis field didn't enclose the pod completely. A reader who doesn't understand how computers work won't understand how a CPU overload affects an escape capsule. 

We have a river at the bottom of a slope. The only arable land nearby is at the top of the slope. We can build a water wheel and turn a screw inside a pipe, so the pipe can lift water up the slope. The slope is about one hundred feet high. At some point, the weight of the water overcomes the power of the screw to lift it (that's all I can glean from hydraulics). My question has two parts. One, what is the maximum height of the pipe? Does the angle or diameter of the pipe make a difference? Two, if necessary, would it be feasible to use a second water wheel to turn a second screw at the top of the first pipe? Of course, if this idea isn't feasible, alternatives are welcome. 

(Somewhat related to Do different star systems experience time differently?) In my futuristic settings1, Humanity discovered a network of portals allowing for instantaneous travel (hand-waved, their exact nature is irrelevant to this question, but these portals are miraculously exempt from science). I want to have such a portal leading to a survivable2 planet with this special quality - time there run much faster than Earth (or anywhere else in the Solar system, for that matter), ideally, every 10 days "here" takes around 40 years "there". Is there any set of conditions that can create such time-differential effect? 1: This is intended for a pen and paper role-playing game. Players will hear description of the setting. Their characters will start on that planet, the goal being to keep the players ignorant of their exotic state for the first chapter of the campaign. 2: To clarify, "survivable" in this context means that two-three "generations" of a tribe of "cavemen" planted there by advanced humans could survive (so around 80-120 years in their local time). These cavemen may be engineered/augmented if necessary, but only in ways that will not be immediately obvious to inquisitive players. They are transported there after any preparations already took place, including creation of a working ecosystem. The planet should have a sun, breathable atmosphere, gravity and other conditions similar to Earth's. Other than that any exotic conditions which make this time-differential scientifically possible are fair game (orbiting a black hole, rogue star system traveling at near light-speed compared to Sol or the Milky Way, exotic material composition for the entire system etc. etc.) Bonus points if you can mention any problems your set of conditions raises (e.g. traveling at near light speed means continuous bombardment by cosmic particles), and even better if you can suggest mitigations for them (e.g. have the planet orbit around a gas giant with a strong magnetic field that will divert most of the particles). 

One model to follow might be the American Indian. They had a very stable society, developed over centuries. They didn't have high technology, but they didn't need it. Your society will start out with more toys. They see the benefit of proceeding with caution. They understand, better than those in our world, that greed is the root of all evil. They understand the need to put common goals ahead of individual goals. Yes, they will progress more slowly, not because they have fewer resources but because they choose to weigh their options carefully, stay in harmony with nature, maintain a sustainable economy, progress ethically, and avoid rapid shifts in infrastructure and supplies. Their communities will be smaller but more numerous. Their politics will tend towards preventing problems rather than exacerbating them. They will revere the elderly for their wisdom. They will treasure the things they have rather than covet the things they don't. Sounds boring, though, from a writer's point of view. Where's the conflict? Who are the villains? One answer is in your question. Someone decides pumping oil out of the ground is a great idea. It's gooey, it's explosive, it's poisonous, but it's a easy source of power. There's your conflict. Someone wants power, and they're willing to upset the established order to get it. The best way to solve an addiction to petroleum is to never get hooked in the first place. 

You already allow a little bit of modern technology, why not stretch that a bit more? Your world already contains functioning space elevators - meticulously maintained by infallible applied hand-wavium, and, (for the same reason) they can't be used to circumvent the tech regression crucial to your world and story. So, unless a functioning medieval spaceship is crucial to your story (or you just find the notion too cool to skip), why not expand the space elevators concept a bit to allow your characters to travel? Maybe the space elevator have "emergency escape pods" or, better yet, "pilot tow-ships" which can be used for longer travel. Or maybe there are completely automated crafts making runs between planets (as part of the maintenance routine of the elevators, perhaps) which a group of resourceful energy manipulators (or even clever or lucky regular humans) can stow-away inside to catch a ride. Maybe there are functioning matter transporters built into the auto-maintenance system and your characters can figure out how to use them - there are many variants to this line of thought, but the bottom line is this: Space travel is hazardous, takes very long time, and requires advanced training, knowledge and technology across multiple disciplines (you'll need navigation, thrust, sealed and controlled environment, replenish-able supplies, waste handling, radiation shielding etc. etc. - and that's before taking into account the medical repercussions of spending months in low G...). So, unless your narrative absolutely demands doing this without the proper tech - why not throw in something usable, but limited as much as you need to stop it from toppling your medieval premise? 

From the way the question is worded, I assume the upper city was built first, with the lower city retrofitted beneath. The first priority in structural engineering is to transfer loads downward. The upper city is built on something, typically a layer of bedrock, so you have to preserve that support while you dig the space and install the load-bearing members. The deeper you go, the more weight you add to the total, because those members also support their own weight. More plausible might be a dome over your lower city. A dome distributes weight to the edges while leaving the center open. Several small domes would be even better. On the other hand, you could have one tall parabolic opening. Once you build this city, though, you run into infrastructure concerns. Where do you get food, water, fresh air, power, light? What do you do with garbage, sewage, smoke? How do you travel to and from the surface? What are the psychological effects of living in a hole? A more plausible scenario might be to build the lower city upside down and share infrastructure with the upper city. 

One simple answer is to make your bullets from ice. Keep them in a cooler until ready to use. If they hit something hard, they shatter. As long as the temperature is above freezing, they'll melt. Best of all, even if one is recovered, there's no way to trace it. 

So, you have a very exotic planet (which is a good reason to try and build a temporary base on it - for research etc...) - which have a deadly "bright patch" in its night sky. During the day, there will still be insane atmospheric interference, lightning storms, winds etc. But the planet itself shields the base from the worst of the effect. But, a bit before the bright patch rises over the horizon things get much worse, and become instantly lethal when the patch is in the visible night-sky. 

But wait, this is a fantasy setting, isn't it? Here things can go increasingly creative/crazy - starting with other sources of energy/biomass to feed the Downbelow denizens or support food chains the subside on, and ending with truly fantastic ideas. Used poorly, this is just a bunch of handwaves circumventing the problem. Used in the right measure, this may add a lot of flavor and wonder to your underworld: 

Light aberration and relativistic beaming means all the starlight reaching the planet is concentrated in a disk 'straight ahead' in the direction of the system's movement (size of disk becomes smaller the faster the system travels). This light is also strongly blue-shifted to a UV, X-ray and Gamma ray level (so radioactive and lethal) At those speeds, any interstellar particles the star hits will behave as cosmic rays (I encourage you to read the list of their effects - they are excellent for the epic instant death you need). 

The reason for heads is to give the eyes a swiveling perch at the top. If you put the eyes on stalks, you could get away with putting nose, mouth, etc., in the torso. If the setting is a "new world" of some kind, you might include an assortment of other creatures with the same configuration, to explain how they evolved. 

Magic is all about patterns. You chant a spell, you wave a wand, you throw eye of newt, and poof! You have to do all three things together, one or two won't work. The magician is looking for correspondences. "As above, so below" was the basis of astrology, but it led to astronomy. Alchemy was magic, but it led to chemistry. According to our science, then, magic is looking in the right places but asking the wrong questions. In your world, however, magic works. The magician understands that patterns have power, even if there's no logical explanation. The scientist understands that, if it works, there's logic in there somewhere, it's just that nobody's found it yet. The scientist can analyze the spell, the wand, and the eye but not understand the gestalt that happens by combining them. By seeing it work, though, you can work backwards from what you do understand. To put it another way, lightning is like magic. It happens, we see it, but until recently we didn't know what it was or why it happened. With science you can ask the right questions, play around with things, and discover how to generate your own lightning in a bottle. We might not have electricity without the idea of lightning to guide us. Science is supremely rational. Magic is supremely irrational. They have to work in the same universe. They operate on the same fundamental forces, so they have common ground somewhere, they're just coming at it from different directions. Perhaps there is something like quantum physics, a more sophisticated model of the universe, that would make sense to both sides once they worked it out.
