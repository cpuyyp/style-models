Looking at manufacturers site I found repair kit with 'mysterious' blue mesh listed as "Cartridge freeze protector". It is supposed to be put over the cartridge (like in this picture) to prevent skin irritation/burn because CO2 gets very cold when discharged. 

It seems I've made a few 'tiny' errors when choosing components to upgrade my bike. The biggest issues I'm facing at the moment are crankset and front derailleur... Bike is Eyble Psych 4 Black Edition (full suspension, 26" wheels) and I'm upgrading various (all) Shimano components to SLX. Because I'm not very familiar with all aspects of MTB geometry and compatibility of parts - I've put myself into weird position. I've chosen M677 crankset (2x10, 22-36t) which (if I get things right) dictates position/hight of front derailleur (SLX 765-B, 2x10, clamp type). I've installed FD provisionally and found out that it sit quite low on seat tube (seat tube is with top pull cable routing). FD clamp is almost touching the joint of seat tube, downtube and chainstays (which are asymmetric) and it could interfere with movement of rear end of bike. (I didn't put chain yet and I tried to compress rear shock all the way - and I didn't notice that FD is hitting anything.) Anyway, I'm worried if this setup is right and should I continue installing other parts? If this is horribly wrong - what are my options regarding another FD (please recommend proper FD type) or (preferably not) changing other components? PS. I know I should have informed myself better before buying things :D 

I'm guessing, just like every other component on a bike, the two factors are durability and weight. Basically, a titanium chain will be a lot lighter and stronger than a steel one, but at a higher price. And just like every other component, you should consider how much do you care about shaving a few grams off your bike vs the price, and how much of a beating you expect it to take. 

I've had my folder on the bus racks, with it's fenders, and it wasn't a problem. But that's with smaller wheels than your Tempo, so I'm not sure if that really answers your question. FWIW, the bar always seems to extend further than I need for the road bikes, so I don't see why it wouldn't extend enough to go past your fenders. 

From my experience, your best bet is to just build a very good relationship with your LBS. Once they know you well enough, they're likely to just make you a good offer to begin with. Note: This isn't advocating building the relationship for the discounts, but they are a nice side effect. 

Turns out that while some chains are directional (like the CN-7900 @lantius mentioned), this one is not. So while I'm not sure how much it matters for other chains, in my case, I clearly don't care :) 

I'm not using SPD pedals anymore but I would try following to transfer cleat position to new shoes. I remembered that I've read somewhere that some shoe manufacturers have some kind of paper pattern to mark position of old cleats and use that pattern to adjust position for new cleats. Since I guess your shoe size iz the same for new pair, making this kind of paper pattern and marking where cleat starts/ends would be rather easy. In order to increase precission you can combine this with measuring it with ruler. Added: There are also products like Ergon TP1 Pedal Cleat Tool but I guess it's rather expensive for just one time use. 

I'm doing complete overhaul and service of my bike and it is time to service Manitou Minute fork and Manitou Radium shock. They both work fine but they have never been serviced (at least for two years as long as I have this bike, and I think they are 2012 or 2013 models :). Problem is, there is no specialized service for Manitou products in my country and there are no replacement parts available. My options are limited to taking my shocks to Fox/RockShox service but they have no replacement parts for Manitou and I guess I can expect they'll be able to clean all parts and change oil. 

One thing to think about - before a long ride, don't make any major changes - don't adjust your seat height or angle, replace your stem, or anything like that. Nothing like trying to fix something kinda minor the night before a long ride, to find out you made it so much worse the next day. 

I had a flat on the way to work today. Not really earth shattering, it was about 5 miles in, only a short walk until the office, where I could fix it in comfort. But walking the bike, I noticed an odd behaviour. The flat was on the front wheel, and I noticed that once per revolution, the handlebars would turn slightly to the left. Very consistent, just as the valve would get to the bottom of the wheel. What would cause this? Is it just the valve being slightly thicker than the (now deflated) tube, or did I somehow damage my rim in the short while between the puncture and me stopping the bike? 

Start simple, and work your way up! When I started riding to work, I at first stuck to all the bike paths I could find, or failing that, roads with bike lanes. And that was fine, but as time went on, I started shaving the route some, skipping the bike path in one section and riding on the road in traffic. Over time (5 years), the route changed to the point I just ride on the roads, the most direct and fast way, on a regular basis. Once in a while, I'll go out of my way to add another hill on the way home, or go ride along the river for the scenic route. What I'm saying is start by finding a route you'll be comfortable in, then, over time, you might find your comfort levels shift, and you'll adjust your route accordingly. If you start with a route that's too aggressive for you, or scary, or just uncomfortable, you're more likely to just give up on bike commuting than adjust the route down to something simpler. 

I'm looking for an upgrade to my crankset and I would also like to replace bottom bracket. My current setup is Shimano M522 (3 x 10) which I would like to replace with SLX M677 (2 x 10) and current bottom bracket is First R30. Are there any compatible bottom brackets from Shimano that can fit in my bike frame (73 mm wide) and which will be compatible with SLX M677 crankset? Shimano recommends BB-MT800-PA as compatible press fit bottom bracket but according to specifications it is available in 89.5 - 93 mm. I'm confused about options and alternatives - please help. 

I would suggest following - try to clip helmet chin strap around both backpack shoulder straps or, if backpack is not too big, try to clip it around whole backpack. (If your backpack is large enough you can put helmet inside it :). There is also possibility to use rubber strap with hooks to fasten your helmet. Tbh, I have backpack which has dedicated helmet holder but I rarely use it. I find it much faster to hang it around stem and handlebars. That way it is much faster to put your helmet on compared to taking off backpack, untying helmet and putting it back on. 

Check with your local cycling advocacy group, they often have bike-handling classes, which tend to teach both techniques and give you some insight to the law in your area. As you mentioned you're from Boston, I recommend checking out MassBike's classes. 

The trick to staying warm for your winter rides is layers. Keep in mind your overpants aren't there to keep you warn, per se, just to keep you dry. You can wear under them pants, long johns, long warm spandex, whatever floats your boat. That's part of why they would be baggy too. When I used to commute in Boston through the winter, I wore thick long spandex pants under my snow pants, and that, combined with the heat generated by riding, was enough to keep me warm through -5F blizzards :) 

I've seen a number of local bike shops that were running programs to recycle old tires and tubes. They never seem to keep running for a long time though, so it strikes me that there's some sort of problem with those, otherwise they'd keep going. I suppose it's worth asking your LBS? 

My guess is that BART is very intentionally NOT making a policy on the matter. They wouldn't be able to make one that allows trailers, but as long as they haven't been forced to speak on the matter, it becomes an issue at the station agent's discretion. Yes, that makes it difficult to plan around what you know is allowed, but I think it's still better than a flat out "no you cannot do this". 

This isn't exactly what your are looking for but it is simple solution. I use cheap foam self seal pipe insulation of various diameters and put them on parts of bike that can be damaged during transport (fork, top tube, chain stay, etc) or you can fix it to your bike rack. It is easy to put on/take off, can be used many times and it is really good to prevent collisions of parts if you transport more than one bike on the rack. Those pipe insulations come in lengths of usually 2 meters, with various wall thickness from 9 mm do 2 cm so you can choose ones which will fit your bike frame or rack. 

I'm planning to take my bike on this year vacation but I have certain dilemmas where and how to keep bike secure during my stay. Bike is nothing fancy (MTB, 26" wheels, full suspension bike with Manitou shocks, aluminum frame, new SLX groupset, Fox DOSS seat post...) more of a sentimental value because I put too much work and effort in maintaing it. First of all, I'm staying at a hotel which doesn't have secure room for storing bikes and management doesn't allow keeping bikes in room or on balcony. Hotel only has bike racks at the entrance to each hotel wing (some of theme are covered with 'security' cameras) and most guest keep their bikes locked there. At night, those racks are in dark and I have no idea if I'll be able to see it from my room. My concern is that by keeping my bike with other bikes (usually cheaper ones), it will stick out and be nice 'target' due to higher end parts and components. The other option is to keep bike inside my car on unsecured parking lot (no street light, no surveillance) which is even further away from hotel and my car has no alarm to hear if someone tries to open it. My bike will be unattended during night, and most of the day while not riding it (meals, going on beach...) I also considered leaving my bike at home and renting bike but prices are outrageous - so it isn't an option. To be honest, at the moment I'm still searching for a decent bike lock so I have yet to solve that part of a problem (and I'm probably little paranoid when it comes to bikes). Any ideas and suggestions how to secure bike (and enjoy vacation) are more than welcome.
