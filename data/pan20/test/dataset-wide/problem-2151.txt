I've done this, more than once. Once the stress of a live coding interview is over, answers I couldn't come up with during the actual interview have a way of just popping into my head. Once, literally as I was hanging up the phone at the conclusion of an interview (that involved coding via screen-sharing) a simple, elegant solution to a problem I had failed to solve occurred to me. I let out a scream of frustration, typed up the solution, and emailed it to the interviewer. It has never helped. In my experience, if you do not absolutely ace a technical interview, you don't get an offer. Heck, even if you do ace the technical interview, chances are there are several other developers in the candidate pool who performed similarly well, so your chances are still not very good. Competition for programming jobs is pretty cutthroat :) 

I think it is definitely more advantageous to keep your previous salary a secret when you're earning below (or right at) market rate. However, when you're making significantly above market rate, being coy about your salary history can result in you wasting a lot of time, for example, by getting all the way to the end of an interview process and being offered 30% less than you current salary. It's happened to me more than once, and it's extremely frustrating. This is why I now like to have a conversation about (at least ballpark) pay as early in the interview process as possible. These days, if a potential employer asks me directly about my current/previous salary, I just tell them. About 50% will immediately balk and cut off all contact with me. Others will try to tell me how their fantastic culture/foosball table/etc. makes up for their lower pay... then I can say "No thanks" and move on. This saves a lot of time and energy :) 

When applying for jobs, I tend to follow the "80% match" rule. As in, I only apply if I meet at least 80% of the criteria listed in the job posting. It can be hard to tell which of the long list of requirements (especially in tech) are "must-haves" vs. "nice-to-haves", and I almost never see a job listing for which I'm a 100% perfect match (unless it's one of those overly generic "developer, software (10 ea.)" job listings, which I wouldn't apply for anyway because they provide absolutely no information about the job itself). Anyway, my point is, if being slightly under the experience requirement is the only requirement you don't exactly meet, I would definitely apply. 

No. You should say nothing until you have actually found and accepted a new job. If you tell your boss you are leaving, you may find yourself unemployed before you have a new gig lined up. Also, what if circumstances change and you need to abort your job search? If your boss is already searching (or perhaps even found) your replacement, you may be out of a job. At the very least, you'll look foolish and/or unreliable. Besides, if your search ends up taking a long time, you'll have the opportunity to get some 'lead' experience on your resume. 

A potential employer is probably going to ask if you would be eligible for rehire -- how would your HR answer that question? My advice is to not volunteer anything, but be honest if asked directly. "Misuse of IT resources" is probably all you need to say if really pressed. I didn't get along with one of my previous supervisors (several jobs ago) and was eventually let go, and I've always answered honestly (though I really didn't get asked about it very often): "differences with management." Being fired cost me one job offer as far as I know, but I still found something else fairly quickly and it hasn't been an issue since (Especially now that it is many years in the past). As an aside, if you were making $150k, you should have been able to afford your own personal laptop/tablet/etc. for watching 'inappropriate content.', if that's really something you need to do (if this habit has cost you at least one good job already, maybe you should find something else to do with your spare time, or get some help if it has become an addiction for you). I'm amazed people still get caught doing this sort of thing. 

I once received two offers (nearly) simultaneously (this was early in my career and they were for fairly junior-level positions). One was 30% higher than the other. I was unemployed at the time, so either would have been a 'raise' from that perspective (though, the lower offer was less than my previous salary). I sent a polite email rejecting the offer from Lowball Corp, saying the canned "Sorry, but I decided to pursue another opportunity that is more in line with my career aspirations, etc." A couple of hours later I got a call from Lowball Corp's recruiter, asking for the "real reason" I rejected the offer. I said "Look man, MegaCorp offered 30% more than you did." He was understanding and I got the impression he was going to talk to the hiring manager about increasing the budget for the position. I guess my point is, just as you would like to have (useful, actionable) feedback when a company declines to extend an offer, sometimes the reverse is true. And the risk of lawsuits when giving honest feedback to a large company is pretty close to nil. 

Get a copy of all of your performance reviews. Those will be almost impossible to get later. Particularly if all of your reviews were outstanding and you were suddenly let go for "performance." :) Also, information regarding any pension and/or 401k (if in the US) benefits you may have, in case you need to do a rollover, etc. Make sure you know when any other benefits stop (medical, etc. -- do they cut off immediately or run through the end of the current month). Lastly, this might be a good time to ask for letter(s) of recommendation / reference permission from any past or current supervisors. 

This just depends on the company. If the technologies requested are at least related to work you have done in the past, I would play up my domain knowledge and ability to learn new languages quickly (which it would appear you are already doing). However, some companies are looking for someone that can fill an immediate need. They want someone who has knowledge and experience in the specific technologies they are using such that they require little or no training and can be productive on day one. These sorts of companies tend to stick to widely adopted technologies (Java, etc.) so that they can find replacements quickly. These companies will generally prefer someone of average talent who has X years experience with the right technologies over a genius with experience in other areas. If you don't have the skills, you won't even get an interview. No great loss, you probably wouldn't want to work at such a place anyway. Other companies (usually the smaller ones, but not always) tend to seek out talented software engineers first and consider experience with the right technologies to be a bonus. Usually you'll be able to tell which sort of employer you're dealing with early on in the application process (if the job posting itself doesn't give it away). If they don't care what language you use to solve problems during the interview process (either pre-screening homework or 'whiteboard' questions during the interview itself), that's a good sign. I have been known to satisfactorily complete such an 'interview homework' assignment in an unfamiliar language only to be rejected later on when the interviewer(s) learned that my experience in language X was basically limited to said homework assignment :/ Alas, I have had to develop better filters on my side of the interview process, and a lot of it comes down to gut feelings (based on experience) that lead me to say "Sorry, no longer interested" :) 

Be absolutely sure you want to be a tester before you make that switch. After a few years away from software development it will be extremely difficult to go back. It would be like working in software maintenance with some legacy language/technology for years and then trying to get a dev role using the latest stuff (actually, it would be worse than that). In regards to your second question - yes, after doing testing for a while, you will be considered a Test Engineer (or some equivalent title). In other words, yes, this is a career change, you would be leaving software development to become a tester. Now, testing isn't a dead end -- at companies I've worked for testers can become leads of a test team (esp. on large programs), QA manager, etc. Personally I wouldn't do it, but I have known Software developers that transitioned to 'Test Engineer' and loved it. I've also met one that tried it for a few months and then ran away screaming. It probably depends on your personality and what type of work suits you. A good tester is a great resource to have, as much as I may get frustrated with them :) If you love writing and/or following processes/procedures, are extremely detail-oriented, and enjoy making devs angry, then testing might be for you. 

I was once in a similar situation. I worked for a large company that had a no-strings-attached tuition assistance policy. That changed right before the last semester of my Master's program (they used the whole 2008 financial crisis as an excuse) to a requirement to repay if you leave the company within 2 years. So I ended up being on the hook for one semester's tuition. Not long after this, a good portion of the office received 60-day layoff warning notices (economy, etc). Some folks were able to transfer within the company and some took the layoff, got severance, etc. I shrugged and began looking for a new job assuming that the impending layoff would absolve me from my payback obligation and if I timed things right, maybe I'd get some severance too. Well, my own layoff was cancelled about the time I received an offer (a manager was trying to help me out, or something... gee thanks). Anyway, did the company now expect me to pay back my tuition assistance? Yes, they did. Fortunately I hadn't accepted the new offer yet, but I was now less than happy with my current employer and wanted to leave. So I called up the new employer and laid out the situation: "Sorry, I got un-laid off and now I owe my current employer money", and asked for a signing bonus to cover the tuition assistance repayment. They said, "Sorry, don't have the budget for that, however, we can bump up your salary (which was already higher than my current pay) by a few thousand." So I took it. Worked out ok, I was back to even after a few months at the higher salary. 

This has generally not been allowed at any place I've worked. The most common reason is that the IT department doesn't want devices they have no control over accessing the network and introducing malware, etc. Management likely doesn't see any legitimate reason to allow this either. Using your own equipment implies that you might mingle personal and company business on your laptop... for software developers this can lead to IP issues, etc. 

Getting a small commission is better than getting no commission at all. And the salary bait-and-switch is a common tactic amongst "professional" recruiters. My guess is the position actually has a lower salary range, and the recruiter just quoted a higher figure in order to hook a few quality candidates who would otherwise pass on a lower-paying position. I have worked with external recruiters in the past, and have never actually gotten a job through one of them. They do nothing but waste my time. 

Unless you're a telecommuter and telling your boss in-person involves getting on a plane, tell him/her in person. It's awkward and uncomfortable, sure. But some things you just have to do. Have your resignation letter with you, and hand it to your boss after you've said your piece. It should mention the effective date of your resignation and/or what your last day on the job should be. Before you meet with your boss, you should at least think through how you will respond to, say, a counter-offer, or what you'll do if your boss gets angry or unreasonable (if he/she has that kind of personality). 

I have a 'Training & Certifications' section on my resume where I list any relevant Coursera courses, company-sponsored training, certifications, etc. Though, I would only list Coursera courses for which I completed all assignments and received a 'completion certificate' at the end. Whether an employer will care about your online training or not just depends. If you recently completed a Coursera course in a new language/technology/etc. that the employer is using, that's probably relevant. Classes in completely unrelated subjects you took for your own personal edification should probably be left off.
