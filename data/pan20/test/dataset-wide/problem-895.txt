Not really, unless you're willing to allow a lot of stretches and assumptions. We could scrape a motivation for Arata to have ordered the abduction. Firstly, it could be argued he had the motive: he has asked Rumata multiple times for "lightnings", to crush the oppressors of common folk. Rumata always refused, justifying the refusal by the very possible scenario where one of Arata's old allies would overthrow him and use the "lightnings" for less noble purposes. 

Author's stance that it was Reba who ordered the abduction, is much stronger. It is far more likely that Reba was intended as the wannabe abductor or killer. Notice the following lines: 

"The Sculpted" is the word used to refer to any non-human inhabitants of the world of The Spire. All of them are different from humans in physical appearance, often quite drastically. 

Thus, seeing that Rumata could not be swayed by the means of persuasion, Arata decided to try a more blunt method: make it sting for Rumata, by killing the one person he truly cared for on this planet. Rumata would then use the lightnings himself, and cause at least some destruction to the lords and oppressors Arata hates so much. Arata could also have seen Rumata as having betrayed him, by saving him, providing him with money, but not giving him weapons. 

I couldn't find any historical references to real figures who had those names, save for Sergei Kozhin (Сергей Кожин). He was a Napoleon-era Russian cavalry general, who led some very successful attacks against French forces. I couldn't find a way to relate him to the events of the novel. 

Another online article claims the TV series fixed the most important flaw of the novel - a very shallow portrayal of Laura's character. Compared to Laura, who is supposed to be an important character in the novel, Sam, being only a supporting character, receives an unproportional amount of descriptions. 

Say, a diode is anisotropic (it offers resistance one way, and no resistance the other); moving away from science, there are one-way roads, as the one in the book. The word is of Greek origin ("anisos" = unequal, "tropos" = turn) according to Online Oxford Dictionary and Dictionary.com The Russian counterpart, as I would expect from a word of Greek origin, sounds exactly the same ("anizotropnoye"; pronounce "ahn-eezo-trope-no-yeah" if you wish): 

Neil Gaiman's The Sandman ran for 75 issues; there was one "special" issue which told Orpheus' story, but it's not numbered. According to Neil Gaiman in The Sandman Companion, he was intending to end the series at some point, but it's not clear whether he intended the series to run for exactly 75 issues Mike Carey's Lucifer - which uses the character created in The Sandman and shares the same continuity - also ran for 75 issues; it had a 3-issue comic The Sandman Presents: Lucifer - The Morningstar Option, a one-shot Lucifer: Nirvana, but those are, again, not numbered. Both comics were published monthly, so I understand that they ran for the same amount of time (~6 years) - but what is the reason for that? Is it purely a coincidence that the two series ran for exactly 75 issues? Was it a homage from Mike Carey to Neil Gaiman, and the series Lucifer originally was a spin-off from? 

In Rachel Rising #38 the readers learn that Lilith once met a banker she had known some 60 years before that, and her acquantance with said banker helped save the factory she worked at. But why would she do that? Firstly, she hates Manson and wants to see it destroyed for good. Secondly, she seems to hate humanity in general, so helping anyone doesn't look like the sort of thing she'd do. And yet, she quite intentionally saved the factory from being closed, in a town she hates most. Why? 

I think, in the context of the novel, those are the names of the operatives who were previously named "sprinters", i.e. people who could not simply stand and watch the barbarian actions of the population, and decided to act themselves in accordance with their understanding of right and wrong. They're first mentioned by Don Condor: 

On a related note, today (15th of April) is the birthday of Boris Strugatsky, one of the authors of this terrific book! 

What is the reason for "bolding" only certain parts of these words? Are we supposed to read them by placing stress on these parts, or is it something else? The reason I ask is because I have never before seen only a part of work being highlighted, unless it was needed to point a mistake (oh, my dear essays). 

There is no indication in various sources found online that Gaiman was influenced by Heinrich Heine. In short, these are the authors Gaiman said he was influenced by: 

While doing some background research for another question about Daniel Clowes' Ghost World, I stumbled upon this article, which mentions the following exchange: 

While writing the answer for What existing songs, if any, was the soundtrack of “The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt” based on? on SFF, I learned that the songs that had any lyrics were mostly (if not all of them) inspired by existing songs, many of them folk songs. Some of those include 

Watchmen, the 1986 comic written by Alan Moore and drawn/lettered by Dave Gibbons, is recogniseable (among other features) for the schematic of its comic pages - they all use the 9-panel grid: 

This appears right after Martin discovers Herbert Spencer, who works will play a major role in Martin's later life. I can understand the sentences before the one with highlighted bit; I can also understand why he "went around like a somnambulist". What I can't understand is the "nightmares" and "gods". If "nightmares" are used in a literal sense here, why would he have nightmares at all, especially with gods? If the nightmares are meant in a more symbolic sense, then what do they represent? It is stated in the book that Martin resented sleep, seeing it as a waste of time, and thus sleeping for only 5 hours a day (even trying sleeping for only 4 hours, but that was too hard). I just don't see why Martin would experience anything negative in his sleep, since everything thus far has only been good for him - Ruth, studying, writing, and now Spencer. 

Click for full page And even in Lucifer #75 ("All We Need of Hell"), he is seen with his bat-like wings, in a faithful reproduction of the same scene from Season of Mists: 

Did I say short? Must have slipped. But in short, Gaiman doesn't mention Heine as his influence. I think the problem is in the premise of your question: Morpheus is not in the state of "perpetual, existential angst". In the first volume Preludes and Nocturnes there are some hints that Morpheus is having some sort of existential crisis, but in the end it gets resolved: 

The demon Crowley, living on Earth was as long as it existed, has long been weaving plots to aid Hell in the coming Armageddon. Though, of course, it doesn't seem that good an idea when it starts, both Crowley and Aziraphale worked in their respective fields to aid their factions: 

Neil Gaiman is on record saying the people who captured Morpheus in issue #1 (i.e. Roderick Burgess and the Order of the Ancient Mysteries) are 

The protagonist of American Gods, Shadow Moon, has never met his father. His mother had refused to share information about his father with him as well: 

Only the Free Search Group members are as physically developed, possibly due to some tampering with their bodies and stuff (for which there's no evidence in what I've read so far). It's an inconsistency in the writing, because Prisoners of Power and Space Mowgli were written separately in different years (were they? I'm not sure). 

In the second volume of Fables, Animal Farm, we see that the Fables possess an enormous amount of various firearms: 

Morpheus describes them as obeying the oldest rules, in the same way he does. The Three-in-One appear to be a fundamental force in the Universe. And then there's this panel after the events described above - to me, it appeared as Neil Gaiman's monologue, reflecting on the plot of The Sandman. 

I've been following the 2016 Lucifer series, and enjoying it. While re-arranging my Calibre library, I noticed that, while all the issues up to and including 12th have been written by Holly Black, issue 13 was written by Black and Richard Kadrey, while all issues after that were written by Kadrey alone. Click for full resolution. The original Lucifer comic series was written by Mike Carey alone. The Sandman was written by Neil Gaiman alone. While a rotating cast of artists is a known thing in comics, especially in The Sandman and the new Lucifer series (though not so much in Mike Carey's series), I didn't know of a series that would change the writer in the middle of the run, and especially in the middle of an arc. I know some other comics do it, but I expected Lucifer to be held to a higher standard. What is the reason the writer was changed mid-series? Was it a pre-mediated decision, or was it because of a disagreement over the process (which seems unlikely since Black and Kadrey did an issue together)? 

Among those adolescent boys, someone has to be the grownup. This hapens to be Anka. And from her overall tone and posture throughout the prologue, one can see that she acts unimpressed by boys' feats. I believe Anka being the grownup, and Pashka being the least grownup, is what makes her dismiss Pavel's address as angrily as she did. Pavel was most likely trying to patronise her by using a diminutive "Anechka", given this is the first time she ever ran away from the boarding school with them. He felt he needed to introduce the newbie to the adventure, but Anka had a different opinion on the subject. Anechka is a very childish and diminitive name. Disclaimer: this part reflects my own observations and experiences, and I don't expect everyone to agree. Well, not necessarily childish - lovers may use it in their conversations, but I don't think it is very common. Of all my friends called Anna, all preferred to be called Anya (Аня). An'ka (Анька) is also possible, but it is even less informal and has to be used for someone who is a very close friend. Anna sounds too formal - there were two Empresses or Russia with that name (one, two); Anechka, on the other hand, is very patronising. Both of my friends did not (mildly put) prefer to be called Anechka under any circumstances. In Anka's situation, when she was among peers, she definitely would not prefer to be called Anechka, or, even worse, Anyusha (Анюша). Anka, on the other hand, does not sound patronising, but rather as a nickname that is intended to be used by peers (this isn't something I could possibly rationalise either - the ending -nka is often used to derive new "friendly" names for things, and I always thought upon reading that Anka preferred to be called that because it sounds teenager-ish). There may have been a behind-the-scenes reason for the name "Anka". The rest is pure speculation and is only tangential to the question. This is pure speculation, and a very far stretch, and frankly, more of a historical anecdote, but it appears that an Anka was a major character in the 1934 Soviet film Chapaev, about the eponymous Red Army comander. In his introduction to Hard to be a God, Ken MacLeod notes that Hard to be a God was intended to be written differently, as "an exciting adventure story in the manener of The Three Musketeers". Authors changed the tone of the novel after Nikita Khrushev's visit to the avant-garde exhibiton, where he heavily criticised the artists, using, among others, swear words. Boris Strugatsky reflected on this in his afterword for Hard to be a God: 

Italics authors', bold emphasis and choice of capitalisation mine V says "his master's voice", which is also the title of the novel by Stanislaw Lem. I can see that V is most likely talking about the order in which the citizens of post-war Britain live - the oppression, constant surveillance, fascism, etc. V's primary goal throughout the novel is to make people raise their heads and pave their own way with their own decisions, as opposed to their masters' voice. But still I find the choice of words here peculiar. Having skimmed through Lem's novel's description on Wikipedia I can see that it is not exactly about the same things as V for Vendetta. There is a bit about "criticizing Cold War military and political decision-making as corrupting the ethical conduct of scientists", but as I said, this is not what V for Vendetta is about. So here comes my question: is this quote a conscious reference to Stanislaw Lem's His Master's Voice? If so, how exactly are the two books linked? If not, what explains this choice of words (for instance, "their master's voice" would be more suitable, I think)? 

Look at it this way - the reason why companies need DRM is because digital files can always be copied verbatim, i.e. bit for bit. Companies cannot prevent files from being copied and re-distributed so they need DRM - a system that alters the files in a way that the contents can only be accessed under specific circumstances, e.g. by entering a license key, inserting an official CD, etc. With hard copies, copying "files" is significantly harder, because one has to get a hold of the physical copy of the product. What was equal to hitting the 'download' button, now requires taking a stroll to the library, or paying money for an actual copy. Oh, and some more diligent copy centres will not allow you to copy more than a certain per cent of the book. While this doesn't apply to every country, it may still be an obstacle. Coming back to your actual question, what you are describing is called, per Wikipedia, the "analog hole". While it may be nigh-impossible to decipher a DRM-protected book, or crack a DRM-protected game, once you have a physical copy of an object there is a number of ways you can copy it. Off top of my head, I can already think of a "lamp + tripod + DSLR camera stand", which is not very hard to construct, but is good for practical purposes. Combine this with optical character recognition, and you have a fault-proof home-made analog piracy system. Why fault-proof? Because digital cameras use the same working principle as the human eye, so DRM, in this case, will be more of a double-edged stick than it is with digital content. There are multiple technologies available, that make traditional scanning and copying impossible. For instance, there is a technology that will make "VOID" texts appear on scanned copy: 

In English-speaking world - very positively. Because they weren't translated to English before the games came out :D There's a thread on Reddit which asks the same question - sadly, none of the answerers quote any sources. It's hard to provide exact sale figures, because there are now different editions and two different translations, but it's certain that the release of the first game marked an increase in sales of the English translation of the book - simply because it didn't have an official English translation before that (at least according to Wikipedia). Andrzej Sapkowski himself says he was popular in English-speaking countries before the games were published: 

Notice that is says "dreamed of" instead of "desired". I think the line between dreams and desires in this case is that Vassily didn't truly want the girl to belong to him - he was curious as to whether she truly was as she was depicted in the miniature. Hence he dreamed of her, but without romantic or sexual desire. 

I took the changing typeface to indicate Delirium's changing voice volume, and maybe pitch, while the colour could indicate her overall (inner) mood. Klein most probably took the "on the verge" part from Gaiman: 

It very much seemed like there's some background I was missing, since people don't usually go accusing people of betraying their country in song lyrics for no good reason. Turned out I was right - this website, where I also took the lyrics from, claims that "Сегодня он играет джаз, а завтра Родину продаст" ("Today he is playing jazz, and tomorrow he'll sell his motherland.") is a line from a Soviet magazine Крокодил (Crocodile), which became popular and widely known for some time. Okay, but who is Ja? This website lists "джа" is a slang word for jazz - how is this related to "him" from the magazine? And how does that relate to the rest of the lyrics: 

How did Tavi ever learn about them? She was only a newborn child then. No one but some people did, and those were told to keep their mouth shut. 

My assumption is that the story of Adam and his wives was not meant as a history of human beings as well - Cain does say "you're everybody's mother", and even though Eve says "it's a matter of opinion", which part of this comic series isn't? Dreamers, in The Sandman universe, are not only humans... and not even "living beings" in the accepted sense of the word. Take this panel from The Sandman: Overture #2 - this is what Dream looked like for the first dreamers: 

I can find a source for the similarity with David Bowie - in The Sandman Companion and in this panel from Season of Mists: David Bowie image source The relevant chapters of The Sandman Companion don't touch the subject of Milton's Paradise Lost, yet the the assumption that it was an influnce is floating everywhere and is taken for a fact. Is there any evidence, in the form of an acknowledgement by Neil Gaiman, that Paradise Lost was an inflience on Lucifer's character? If so, which traits do Milton's and Gaiman's visions of Lucifer share?
