I'm following these instructions to upgrade postgres from 9.1 to 9.3: $URL$ When I restore (Step 8), I get a ton of messages like this: 

in supervisor init script. It looks like for some reason supervisord was installed in on this machine. Super annoying that nothing is printed... 

My question is more of a ..."where should I look" question. If supervisor isn't logging anything the only other place I can think to look of is the syslog which doesn't indicate anything crazy to me. 

I have a file on server that can be written by a group. The group is called "deploy" and the user is "mima." I have verified "mima" is in "deploy" with: 

I'm running an EC2 instance. According to EC2 specs, it should come with . When I SSH into my new machine, I don't see any of these drives. All I see are my EBS volumes: 

This is a Mongo server and I'd like to use instance storage as temporary space while backing up Mongo. How do I locate the 420GB instance stores and mount them? I've read the EC2 docs and I am still unclear. 

I thought restarting the server would work but no luck. Even trying to SSH in with root gives me the same error. It seems a bit weird that I would get completely locked out of a server due to this and it would never reset. Is there something I'm missing about how to reset this? It's actually hard to google for information about this because everyone experiencing this problem seems to have a bunch of keys in that a dumb client in cycling through but I am setting my key very specifically: 

I have no idea where to go from here. If anyone knows the root cause of this or has good instructions on upgrading from postgres 9.1 to 9.3, please let me know! 

I don't think this config actually matters but posting anyway. I'm using the stock supervisor global config. I installed supervisor via standard ...and just to be sure: 

This seems like it should work because the group deploy can write and mima is in that group, but I do get a permissions error. 

I recommend reading the revision number from a file rather than reading from an environment variable. There isn't an easy way to ensure that your current environment is the same a the environment that Apache is running under. Also this ensures that the revision number in the php code survives reboots, etc. You should set Subversion to ignore the svn-revision file so you aren't checking it in. 

From reading your answer it sounds like this is a client-side issue. Subversion does not support client-side hooks (from what I know) so I would recommend writing a small script similar to the following to perform your update and also update the revision number in a file. 

What do we need to do to make the disks be recognized? Any other things that we need to try? EDIT Here is the output of : 

Basically you need to include all directories in the search, then add all files to the list, the exclude all other files. The option is handy to use as it excludes any directory that doesn't have a file. 

At this point, the pre-delete and post delete verifications still show the same disk blocks in use. I should instead see a reduction in the number of in use blocks. Waiting an hour (in case it takes a while for the TRIM command to be issued) after the test file is deleted still shows the same blocks in use. I have also tried mounting with the options, but that doesn't seem to help at all. Partition that was created from above (I keep the partition small so the verification can go faster): 

Rsync can be confusing about selective copies like this. I use the following to do the task that you're asking for: 

You may need to talk to you AD administrator to set up a service account for Apache to use to connect to AD (if your AD requires you to bind before performing a search). If you wish to allow anonymous reads while requiring users to authenticate to write, replace the line above with the following: 

Glancing at the Instagram post, I don't believe they're using Nginx for buffering or caching (although I could be wrong). I use something similar but with HAProxy instead of Nginx. Some of the reasons why we took this approach: 

I have a Centos VM running with SELinux enabled. I wish to have sshd listen to another port --- says, 993. I've modified the sshd_config file to listen to another port, but SELinux is getting in the way. I don't want to disable SELinux. How do I tell SELinux that it's okay for sshd to be reading TCP connections on port 993? The correct command to use is but I cannot use that command because port 993 is already in use in another policy: 

We're currently using Mailman as a mailing list manager. Mailman modifies the content of mail messages. The problem is that some of our users are sending digitally signed messages and the modification makes the signature break. I've seen this behavior with Apple Mail, Outlook, and Thunderbird. The problem seems to be this: S/MIME signed messages are implemented with a MIME Content-Type. Mailman wraps this inside a MIME Content-Type. None of the mail readers look inside the outer for the inner . We won't be able to get the clients fixed. Is there anyway to modify Mailman so that it doesn't have this behavior? 

RHEL 7 includes in the official repository. However, this module does not install mod_php. I have tried all of the approaches for installing rh-php70-* and none of them installs and registers the appropriate php module. How does one do it? 

So this makes no sense to me. This means that I have 64 CPUs with 16 cores each, or a total of 1024 cores. However, online documentation for the Intel E5-2686 v6 claims that it has 36 cores and hyperthreading, for 72 virtual cores. What's going on? How many cores are there? 

Is there a way to read the certificate in a consumer credit card EMV chip and use this to authenticate to an Apache web server using the client-side certificate support in SSL/TLS? 

We would like to have a network backup system with a user that can read any file on our servers but not write any file. Is there any way to do this under Linux (and specifically Fedora)? We would rather not have a remote that can erase any file... 

If the name for the reverse address does not match the forward address, it is likely that the name you see was the name assigned to your IP address when the IP was used by a different customer of your provider. If the name does match, you should talk to your provider and make sure something else isn't going on. If possible, please revise your question with some examples of what you're seeing. 

You didn't explicitly state how Subversion is served, but based on your tags, I'm assuming Apache. Using Apache 2.2 to serve Subversion with authentication by AD is pretty simple. In your Apache config, you need to add the appropriate Auth parameters to the location block for the repository. For example (restricted read and write access): 

It appears that the first and last sectors of the file are within a different erase blocks from the rest of the file. Therefore some sectors were left untouched. A takeaway form this: some Ext4 TRIM testing instructions ask the user to only verify that the first sector was TRIM'd from the file. The tester should view a larger portion of the test file to really see if the TRIM was successful or not. Now to figure out why manually issued TRIM commands sent to the SSD through the RAID card work but automatic TRIM commands to not... 

I strongly recommend against having Apache run as any real user. If an exploit is found in your sites, a malicious user can read or alter your personal files. WordPress will run fine with the files being owned by your user account and with Apache running as a different user. There are a few files and paths which you should to the same group as the Apache server and make group writable. That way Apache can make the necessary changes without the risk of a user having full access to the rest of your files. You should read the WordPress document on Changing File Permissions. 

You need to include all of the parent directories down to the desired directory before using the exclude rule. For instance, I use the following in a backup script:
