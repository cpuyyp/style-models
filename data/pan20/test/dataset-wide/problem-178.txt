However, the force does not necessarily have to be the same. After all, the amount of force on your wheels during normal braking is far less than the force on your bumper in an accident. The difference is that a large force quickly transfers momentum out of the car, stopping it quickly, while a small force slowly draws momentum out of the car, so it takes a while to stop. We can also change the pressure by distributing the force over different areas. Normally your car tires handle the weight (downward force) of your car just fine. However, if all that force is concentrated in the tip of a nail, the pressure goes from 40 psi to many thousands of psi, high enough for the nail to force its way into the tire and puncture it. In fact, this is exactly the mechanism described. Let's take an ordinary knife as another example. It takes the force you apply to the handle and concentrates it into a tiny region along the edge of the blade, where momentum flows from the blade into the object. Cutting a Car Cutting a car in half presents some challenges. The metal of the car requires a very high pressure to cut. We must have a very sharp edge to minimize the amount of area, and therefore the amount of force it takes to cut the car. We also need a material that can handle higher pressures than the metal. Finally, we want to reduce the amount of friction between the blade and the car, so that we can minimize the amount of 'wasted' force we have to apply. Right now these requirements are not met by any material. If we want to slice through the car as easily as a katana through cardboard we need something that is as hard, compared to the car. Your best bet is probably some sort of exotic energy-based blade. Note that lightsabers are typically depicted as several centimeters thick and melting rather than cutting, whereas your blade would be impossibly thin, a nanometer-thick sheet of energy that slips in between the atoms of your target, breaking the chemical bonds holding them together. The actual minimum force it takes to split a material is limited by the material's surface energy. This paper gives a value of around 1 joule per square meter for aluminum. After multiplying by two (because a cut creates two surfaces), this is equal to around 2 ounces per linear foot. That is, it would take at least two ounces of force to cut through a foot-thick sheet of aluminum. That's not much, but it does mean that monofilament whips sometimes seen in science fiction wouldn't be able to cut through thick metal as they are just too light. 

If the car slammed into a wall, as AndyD273 says, "all of the momentum is [dissipated] bringing the car to a stop." More accurately, the momentum flows (via a momentum current, i.e. a force) from the car to the wall. The wall doesn't start moving because it directs the momentum flow into the ground, where it is absorbed by the huge mass of the Earth. The important thing to notice here is that the car loses all of its momentum when it comes to a stop, no matter what stopped it. We could replace "wall" with "kinetic knife" in the previous paragraph and it would be equally valid. 

I'll assume the more extreme end of both, as it makes it more clear what's going on, but the principle is the same no matter how small the effect is. So, before the impact, the entire system (truck + knife) has some forward momentum. After the impact both the truck pieces and the knife are not moving forward, so the forward momentum is zero. Nothing is not something, and that's all there is to it. The effect, as described, cannot reconcile with conservation of momentum. Focusing and Conducting Momentum The description of the mechanism of action is totally plausible, if we make a small change: 

Burst: Energy As Isaac already pointed out, we can get a pretty good approximation of a mage's heat capacity using just the heat capacity of water (since pretty much all of our tissues are mostly water). This gives us a maximum energy burst of: $$ \begin{align} & 40\% \times 8~\text{°C} \times 4184~\text{J}/\text{kg}\cdot\text{K} \times 71~\text{kg} \\ &= 951~\text{kJ} \\ &= 264~\text{Wh} \\ &= 22.0~\text{Ah}~@~12~\text{V} \end{align} $$ 

(Note that this one is zoomed out a little and rotated about 45 degrees compared to the previous one.) We can see that the rightmost pillar is still jet-black compared to the rest of the nebula. Everywhere else in the image is dense with stars, but here the nebula blocks our vision. Note that the tip of the leftmost pillar is also dense enough to block our vision through it, but the gas it consists of is warm enough to emit light. The gas is heated by the light from stars inside or near the nebula. 

As soon as the magi get within 10 m of the staff, they can disintegrate the material surrounding it and retrieve it with their telekinesis. They can then disintegrate the building itself, flying away through the walls/ceiling at 50 kph. If the twenty magi disperse in equally spaced horizontal directions, they can completely disintegrate any object within about 125 m, enough to collapse the entire building (and render any defenses within useless). They may also pick up bystanders (roughly ten per mage, or 200 total) and use them as human shields, making any attempt to stop them out of the question (as protection of the public takes higher priority). Clearly, once they have the staff it's game over. The only way to be sure of the staff's safety is to nuke it from orbit prevent them from taking the staff in the first place. 

What you want is a concentrated release of energy, unlike an explosion which disperses energy outward. My first instinct is thermite, an extremely hot-burning metal powder. Typically it's used for welding railroad tracks, but you can also use it to, say, melt through the engine block of a car. 

But seriously here: there is no way a planet can be larger than a star. Anything that is large enough to ignite fusion in its core has three options: 

The absolute minimum amount of power you need is equal to the total top-of-atmosphere insolation of the entire Earth. We can calculate this by multiplying the projected surface area of the planet with the solar constant: $$ P = E\cdot\pi R^2 = 1.7\times10^{17}~\text{W} $$ Assuming your reactor uses D-T fusion, and does not capture energy from the neutrons produced, your efficcency will be around: $$ 6.7\times 10^{13}~\text{J}/\text{kg} $$ Meaning that your fuel consumption rate is around: $$ 2.6~\text{ton}/\text{s} $$ 

Of course, if the system will never actually be activated, it doesn't actually have to exist, right? Just drop some (fake) hints about the construction of such a system in the right places, and the magi will never even show up out of fear for the staff's safety. Unbeknownst to them, the staff and the public will never be in any real danger. 

Geometric Properties We can integrate to find the length $S$ of a loop: $$ S = \int |d\vec{s}| = \int_0^{2\pi r/R} \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial x}{\partial\theta}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial\theta}\right)^2}d\theta \\ = \int_0^{2\pi r/R} 2(R-r)\sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{R}{2r}\theta\right)}d\theta \\ = 8r(1-\frac r R) $$ The endpoint has coordinates: $$ x = R\cos\left(2\pi\frac r R\right) \qquad y = R\sin\left(2\pi\frac r R\right) $$ This means that the distance across the surface $d$ is: $$ d = R\times 2\pi\frac r R=2\pi r $$ Equations of Motion First, we calculate the distance $\rho$ from the center of the planet: $$ \rho^2 = x^2+y^2 \\ \rho^2 = 2r^2-2rR+R^2+2r(R-r)\cos\left(\frac R r\theta\right) \\ \rho^2 = R^2-2r(R-r)\left(1-\cos\left(\frac R r\theta\right)\right) $$ Then we calculate the velocity $v$ as a function of the rate of change of $\theta$: $$ v^2 = \dot x^2 + \dot y^2 \\ v^2 = 2(R-r)^2\left(1-\cos\left(\frac Rr\theta\right)\right)\dot\theta^2 $$ We can calculate the total energy of the train (per mass) as: $$ \frac{v^2}2 + \frac g{2R}\rho^2 $$ Where $g$ is the surface gravity of the planet. Plugging in our above expressions, adding the initial conditions $\theta=0,\ \dot\theta=0$, and solving for $\dot\theta$ gives us: $$ \dot\theta = \sqrt{\frac{gr}{R(R-r)}} $$ Therefore, the period of motion over one loop is: $$ T = \frac{\Delta\theta}{\dot\theta} = 2\pi\frac rR\sqrt{\frac{R(R-r)}{gr}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{(R-r)r}{gR}} $$ For the Earth, this results in a curve like this: 

In terms of technology, such as system is not too far off. I interned under someone who was interested in these systems, and he helped put together this technology roadmap, which estimates large-scale swarm telescopes are only 20-50 years away. Such a telescope would certainly be cheaper, in terms of energy and materials, than travel to another star in human timescales (based on current understanding of physics). I would say go for it! 

With this sort of cosmology, you can't get orbits. Plus the gravitational attraction between objects on a human scale is too small to notice. With that in mind I'd just get rid of the notion that gravity is attraction between mass. Instead, just define a uniform gravitational field across all of space, pointing perpendicular to the infinite plane of the ground surface. Mass is affected by this universe's gravity, but (unlike our universe) the reverse is not true: mass-energy distribution has no influence on gravity. 

I disagree. Let's take the example of the Panama Canal. The US offered to buy the land for the canal from the Colombian government, but their Senate refused the deal. So, the US simply decided that some Panamanian rebels who were willing to deal were the 'legitimate' government of Panama, and supported them in overthrowing Colombian control of Panama. This case would be even simpler. The aliens would just build their highway and take Jupiter. We have no way to stop them, and we aren't even living there. If there is a public outcry on the aliens' home planet, their government simply explains the situation one of two ways: 

This plot shows the projectiles' total energy loss rate. Not all of this energy will heat the projectile, however: in fact a good portion is used ionizing and heating the air the projectile encounters. Calculating the peak heating according to this Institute for Defense Analysis document (pdf), the projectile will encounter peak temperatures of over $4000-5000~\text{K}$. Modern ablative heatshields for spacecraft are built to withstand up to around $2600~\text{K}$ (although classified heatshield technologies for ballistic missile warheads may have moderately better performance). This means that the projectile would surely disintegrate upon entry. 30×173 mm (Armor-piercing incendiary w/ DU penetrator, PGU-14/B) This massive shell is used by several autocannons and chain guns, most notably the GAU-8/A Avenger: the primary armament of the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II "Warthog", an anti-tank air support and attack aircraft (and a personal favorite of mine). The projectile consists of an aluminum "jacket" surrounding a $10\frac{1}{2}~\text{oz}~(300~\text{g})$ depleted uranium penetrator. Although typical accuracy of the GAU-8 autocannon is only 40 yards at 4000 yards distance, the projectile is probably capable of accuracy similar to typical sniping rounds if fired from an appropriate gun (although such a weapon may be too large for a single operator, and would certainly not be man-portable). 

Zero-energy means that each of these methods take zero energy input or output. However, you will still need a way to purify the gold afterwards (perhaps magical separation?). Note that elements closer to iron have worse yields, since they have much higher binding energies. Due to the zero-energy criterion, most of the mass must be turned into nearby high-energy isotopes to offset the creation of relatively low-energy gold. Transmutations between nearby elements work better, like mercury and gold. Another example, turning air (nitrogen and oxygen) into diamond (carbon) and ruby or sapphire (corundum/aluminum oxide): 

What a megampere electron beam would do to an unprotected target in open air... I leave that to your imagination.
