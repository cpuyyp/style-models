I would say "no". Probably easier. Basically you are using a straight Vigen√®re cipher. The only complication is the use of a Book for the selection of the key. Most importantly you are leaving two weeks between key changes. 

This isn't possible in my view as even if they could somehow generate enough energy to live doing this, they could not grow as growth requires food for raw materials and a digestive system to deal with it. No growth means no way to develop from infant to adult. And of course if you need to feed your creature, because you can't have a solar powered one, then just having money will cost you money. 

Interacting with other objects when you're planet size or larger in mass means they collide with you with enormous force - you have a gravitational field that attracts objects. So what this object will have is lots of craters, like our moon (and the Earth would have them if it didn't have weathering and geological activity that smooths out the wrinkles over times). 

I'm not aware of Earth octopi having this capability now, but if you're writing about them in some future they could always develop such an instinct. However a likely flaw here is that there's no evidence to suggest male or females are going to be more or less intelligent on average. At the very least this kind of story based decision would be politically incorrect and draw a lot of the wrong type of criticism. I'd suggest caution with this idea. The problem with exploiting any such mechanism is that initially your octopi will not have self awareness sufficient to make a conscious decision. You're really better off developing a mechanism that relies on either random chance (and works out at the required ratio) or having them develop a systematic biology that does the job (e.g. first they produce predetermined male eggs, then female eggs in turn). Some mechanism that does not rely on "making a decision" in creatures that we would assume don't have such high level of conscious thought. 

Different gas won't fix the fundamental fact that electrical devices allow faster and smaller and easier to maintain calculating machines than gas ever could. This is simple physics and would be plain as day to your technocrats. 

No it does not. It would in fact collapse into a Black Hole. This is absolutely impossible to avoid, but it would also most likely produce a huge super nova as well in the process of collapse. And long before you gathered even a small fraction of that $10^{40}$ L it would have enough mass to collapse into a star (with an Oxygen-Hydrogen fusion core) and as you added a bit more water it would eventually be large enough to collapse into a black hole. And at that point you'd still have almost all of the $10^{40}$ L left, because the amount of water required to form a black hole is only $4\times 10^{30}$ kg, twice the Sun's mass and one billionth of your total water supply. Now in practice you'd need way more water to make a star with an active core collapse into a Black hole ( as opposed to just becoming a bigger star ). However there is a limit and it's something like 150 solar masses ( still way smaller than your sphere ). But one way or another you get a black hole. A black hole of mass $10^{40}$ kg has a radius of about $93$ AU. And yes, that is larger than a sphere of water of standard density of the same mass. 

Most efficiently ? Grow your own "steaks" in a factory using advanced biochemistry or cloning technology or some technique. This avoids the slaughtering problem, the disposal of unwanted bits and the need to worry about breeding animals (always messy and terribly inefficient :-) ). Likewise milk. And I'm trying hard to imagine a reason a completely alien species would not find human meat and milk actually dangerous to eat, never mind like it. And I'm failing. So no butcher, just a large biochemical plant doing complex things with advanced techniques available to your average Type II civilization. 

The problem with limited protection is that your opponent can disable you (shoot your legs and arms off, for example) and then you are unable to defend yourself or get away. At that point they can, at leisure, get at your heart easily and all you get to do is watch ! This also raises the question of how your creature survive if I can blow it's brains to smithereens. Is it still alive just because it's heart is OK ? So all things considered, you still want as much protection as possible. Others have already commented on the limitations of modern body armor, but I'd also add that if a bullet can enter the body, even if it misses the heart, it can still damage the heart. When a bullet enters the body it does not drill a neat little tunnel, it causes massive shock waves to travel outward from the path of the bullet. This can cause damage to organs not actually directly in the path of the bullet. There's a "nice" demonstration of this effect in this video. So, again, you want to protect as much as possible, because even near misses are a bad idea. 

If your planet has an atmosphere this will not happen like this. The atmosphere will tend to move heat from the cold region to the hot one and the larger the temperature difference the stronger the winds. As a result your planet's temperate ("nice") side will actually get quite a lot of heat and complex weather which will make it just as unpleasant. 

I do not think such a system of moons would be stable. A rough calculations : $F_0$ = Force between inner moon and planet $F_1$ = Force between moons at closest approach $M_0$ = Mass of planet $r$ = 50,000 miles $$F_0 = \frac {GM_0^2}{8(3r)^2}=\frac {GM_0^2}{72r^2}$$ $$F_1 = \frac {GM_0^2}{(8)(10)r^2}=\frac {GM_0^2}{80r^2}$$ So the force from the planet is only slightly more than the force from the other moon. The two moons would therefore distort each other's orbits significantly. They'd almost certainly either end up in radically different orbits (highly eccentric ) or (more likely) collide with each other or even the planet. It's hard to see how they could form in the first place. So this system is not likely to exist in a stable way for long enough to develop and support life of any kind, IMO. To fix this : One small moon (say 1/200th the mass or less of the planet). Probably even with this you'd need to remove that moon to a more distant position or have it at the stable Lagrangian points (see Trojans) to avoid an unstable small moon ending up colliding with the large moon or planet. But that's not an option for large moons of similar size - they'd be unstable (not to mention the problem of how they'd end up there in the first place). 

I'd say yes. Aging requires cellular change over the entire body. Every nerve in your body would be experiencing huge changes in local biochemical conditions (i.e. local to the nerve and even in the nerve) and this would register as a sensation or a whole range of confusing sensations. It's hard to imagine this not generating a pain response in the brain (which is itself also changing). There would also be physical changes - sudden changes in the condition of muscle, cartilage and bone, etc. which would be detected by nerves and generate something like pain. You would probably experience sensory overload, not just pain, but a brain overwhelmed by nerve impulses from all over the body. Even if limited to the surface - the skin - this would generate a lot of biochemical activity local to every nerve and within the nerve. Hard to know exactly what that might feel like, but anywhere from intense pins and needles to something more like being enveloped in flame. 

History proves that no dictator, regardless of how ruthless or all seeing, can ever guarantee a scientific success on the edge of the technological and scientific frontiers. The only way to guarantee success is simply to keep trying when failures happen. The problem for any dictator doing this is simple : you will, if you hope to succeed, put the best people on it. If something goes wrong, at what threshold of it going wrong can you afford to get rid of the people (or your hold on them, e.g. their families) ? After some failure, they're still your best likelihood of success, so getting rid of them is a bad idea. Punishing them (directly or indirectly) for a failure that's simply one of the consequences of pushing into the unknown is not going to change the results. Pragmatic rulers, dictators or otherwise, do not refuse to accept any failure. As an example : Hitler "fired" Field Marshall Von Rundstedt after failing to stop the Normandy invasion. But he wasn't long gone when he was brought back to stop the Allied advance. And Hitler was probably the least pragmatic dictator you could think of. Space colonization is really going to be very hard. One way you would make success more likely is to first crack a lot of other "small" problems. Survival in the long trip to (and from) Mars. Developing safe ways to live on a hostile planet (and you'd start with the Moon). Developing food that can be grown or manufactured from local materials, but that problem requires detailed knowledge about the resources available locally. This takes time - decades - regardless of resources made available to do it all. So if "Pavel" is serious, Pavel is either going to have to be patient or Pavel is going to run out of people who can do the job very quickly. Don't underestimate the willingness of scientist and engineers to do their jobs to the best of their ability under a dictatorship. The best of them (intellectually) will normally also be the most keen to succeed in their own spheres, and they will drive projects more efficiently than any ruthless dictator could. If you'd ever worked for or with some of these people you'd know how single-minded and even ruthless they can be themselves. Scientists aren't, by any means, all humanists. 

Communism. No other scenario is remotely viable in a closed environment with (at best) a fixed resource base. People will have to share and like it. They will have to accept limits on what they can and cannot have. In a sense they will need to be brainwashed - brought up to believe in the ideal and necessity of sharing and sharing alike. You will still have choice. Most likely you would be given a certain number of resource points to dispose of as you wish, the rest is a limited (controlled) selection from some significant resources and possible a limited range of living quarters in different areas that can be swapped between people. Any form of market place demand-sets-price would destabilize the entire economy. It must be tightly regulated. Even the number and sex of children must be monitored and controlled. Personal wealth would be impossible. It would destabilize everything. They can do what they like when they leave the ship, but on it - no. 

In the sense that they could walk through entire forests transforming all the trees to non-living stuff (just chunks of dead tree). They might even do it to cause trouble for people. Or they might do it to show off. That could wreck an ecosystem depending on how fast the transformation is affected. 

The way you describe this is extremely unlikely from a physical sciences point of view. Iron is a relatively abundant metal in a cosmic sense and it's extremely doubtful a planet could form without it being relatively abundant. It's hard to imagine a star forming a system with life bearing planets which had not formed from a nebula with a relatively high iron content. Indeed it's hard to replace blood with an equivalent fluid that does a similar task for another life form without using iron, which you're trying to do without. No iron is a huge problem for your concept, I think. You should also note that copper was commonly used in weapons before iron. The natural development from copper is brass (that's basically copper with zinc). This page on metals used historically in firearms might give you some ideas. Copper is particularly useful as a conductor, and I'd suggest that while iron might be rare, an available source of copper would at least allow your world to develop basic electrical science and engineering. I'm not personally aware of any strong alloy made primarily of lead that could replace iron or copper in an industrial setting, let alone a in an firearm. However I'm no expert in metallurgy and perhaps if you want to pursue this idea you need to seek out an expert in lead alloys and see if they have any ideas. I'd offer the thought that a society that could at least develop skills with electricity and magnetism could develop the tools and chemical engineering required to make other developments.
