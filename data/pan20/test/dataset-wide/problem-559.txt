Ski goggles are a good option, but the main problem with ski goggles is that they block your peripheral vision, even if you have clear lenses. You should augment them with a helmet mounted mirror. These work well with balaclavas (which are nice in the winter, depending on where you live). Regular old clear safety glasses like you use in high school chemistry such as the 3M 91252-80025T are another good option especially if you wear glasses. They don't impair your peripheral vision, but they do leave an imprint under your eyes due to the band tension. Sometimes you have problems with the nose area if you're wearing a balaclava. There are a bit more stylish ones like the Uvex Ignite series, but those don't work well for people who wear glasses (You may want something bigger than these in area as well, but in the same style). These are similar in style to the cycling glasses Fox and other companies sell, but cost a fraction of the price. I've found in general safety glasses to fog less than ski goggles at the tradeoff of slightly less isolation. At -30C, I'd probably be inclined to use the ski goggles, especially if there was significant wind. You may also want to consider a full face cycling helmet with visor but these have the most severe peripheral vision penalties and you may get hot. Mirrors are a must with this. Note that you may want tinted lenses at times as well as clear lenses due to the same reasons as skiers (glare, etc.). As for fogging, you can try things like cat crap, depending your lens material. 

10.9 is the type of steel alloy used, not the size of the hex key (aka allen key) you need. Get a set of hex keys (almost surely a metric set is needed, given that its on a bicycle) and then try them out to see which one fits. I'd guess its something in a 3mm, 4mm, 5mm or 6mm range. 

Campagnolo's system is to provide a tag,Certilogo, with new wheels which people can scan to confirm it is indeed authentic. However, with a used wheel, there is no such tag. With carbon fiber, its incredibly easy for people to make very good counterfeits, so as Campagnolo says, if the wheel doesn't come with the tag, you should consider it being from uncertain origin (i.e. it could be fake). You can also post pictures on forums to see if people can identify them by certain markings, mismatched aesthetics, features that shouldn't be there (brake tracks, for example, or wrong spoke pattern) and weigh them. For example, this thread gives some indicators of fake Campy wheels. It looks like this model is reasonably commonly faked, so keep your eyes wide open. 

If you want a quality product, look at something like Pitlock skewers which are pretty difficult to grab onto, and can also be installed for things like seatposts and stuff (Pitlocks have been around for years and are generally well regarded). Alternatively, lock your wheels properly with good quality U-locks or chains. For example, if you catch the rim in the rear triangle of a standard diamond frame, you can't remove the wheel from the bicycle or the frame without cutting the lock or the rim (which is extremely unlikely to happen). 

1) "am I freeloading, or am I a (financially) valued customer?" Depends. Most bike shops I've been to are happy with giving some of advice -- helping the person find the right part and them do it themselves, since thats how a lot of bike upkeep is done. Of course, doing this too much can annoy people and also choice of timing -- if the shop is just sitting idle, theres probably less annoyance than otherwise. Also, the level of detail -- if you have to be walked through a lot of the repair and it takes a lot of time, that can also be annoying (though some shops are happy to do this and rent tools so people can do this, like an Autozone shop or similar). Most people should be able to judge their behavior on their own. If you want to get advice and stuff as a primary thing you do at a bike shop, you might want to join a bike co-op if you have one in the area. Most are friendly towards people learning from each other how to do things in a shared space and a lot of them have (some) parts available for sale for the community, and you can pick up remaining parts at your LBS. 2) "putting disk brakes on a 90's Hardrock frame, they will suggest that it will be easier to just get a new bike" Yeah, because it is the sensible choice. You'd need new brakes, but also new wheels so the rotors mount, and a new fork to have the brake caliper mount. The rear may be handled with an adaptor to mount the caliper. This would probably cost about as much as a basic hardtail with disc brakes on it now. I'd be worried if anyone suggested that it was a good idea to proceed with adding disc brakes to a 90s Hardrock frame. 3) "what are the typical profit margins on new bikes, repairs, and parts?" Depends a lot on the type of shop, where you are, brands they carry, how much they charge for repairs and parts. Some mom and pop bike shops are now using amazon as (part) of their part suppliers, which sets pricing one way; others use big suppliers like Quality Bicycle Products (QBP), though you can't see the pricing for the QBP catalog directly. Comparing prices of parts you bought to online is one way to get an idea, though that doesn't properly weigh overhead between the LBS and online. The profit margins on repairs depends on the repair; if parts are broken out separately (as they are in many places) from the labor, it's the technician's time vs cost. Some places do x dollars/hour of labor, and charge you that way. Other places charge you for the type of repair at a flat fee, which may be set based on time it takes on average or just to have reasonable profits. The way I see it, don't worry about it too much unless you feel like you're being ripped off (in which case go shop somewhere else); after you live in an area for a while, you get an idea of which shops are good/bad. LBS's have more overhead than online places since they have to pay for buildings, staff salaries, etc. 

Where should pedals be located (relative to the rider)? Wherever its most comfortable for you. It's a matter of personal preference (*). What works for person A won't necessarily work for person B, even if they have the same measurements and/or similar bikes. Your riding position relative to the pedals will change depending on the type of bike, terrain, inclines, elevation, required power output, level of fatigue (shifting forward/back to use your quads/hamstrings/calves more or less in relation to each other), etc. -- even on one ride, you may use many riding positions. You'll need to play with different saddle positions (heights, angles, forwards/backwards ness, width of the saddle,etc. ), handlebar positions (height, angle, width and type of bar (less changeable; some people with wide shoulders want wide bars or more flared drops), etc.) to find something that works best for you. All of these will change your pedal position to some extent relative to the rest of your body. And all of these will depend on your body. A lot of people use KOPS (knee over pedal spindle) for proper positioning (the knee is over the 9 o clock position for the crank), but it's not exactly scientific as argued by Keith Bontrager. But it's not necessarily a bad place to start for most people, and tweak from there. The goal of a bike fit is to find something that works for you. You can try a professional one, or play around with things on your own. (*) Obviously, if the setup is causing you pain, it's wrong and you should change it. See this link for some adjustments regarding pain. 

You're stuck with square taper bottom brackets. But there are plenty of good square taper cranksets still on the market (new and used). You have a few options though: 

Cable stretch is mostly just things settling into place (ferrules into housing, housing into frame stops, housing compressing) rather than physical stretching of the cables, and after a week or so of installing new cables, you simply adjust them to the right tension. This is normal, as is periodic adjustments of cable tensions involved on your bicycle. Replacing cables is done for a different reason than "cable stretch". A Bowden cable (see also here), such as the shift and brake cables used on a bicycle consists of an inner wire and housing. As the housing's lubrication wears away(*) or the cable rusts, the cable catches on the housing causing things like the brakes not releasing properly or sloppy shifting. Also, sometimes the cables (which are made of twisted wires) fray and break. If this happens on your brake cable, you don't have braking (which is bad!). Most shift cables fail safely by just forcing you to some extreme gear combination (rear is normally the smallest sprocket). Thus, it is advisable to replace your shift and brake cables periodically. I have to replace my cables at least once every winter due to corrosion and road crud, for example, but I do have to do cable tension adjustments periodically when the cables are not replaced (such as indexing getting a bit sloppy or to account for my brake pads wearing down or something). (*) Some people oil their cables. Most manufacturers now recommend against this. 

You can calculate your speed vs cadence using this online calculator. You want your cadence to be roughly 80 rpm (60 being the lower bound). With a 42t chainring and 14t cog in the back (not uncommon for a 26" mtb -- this is big ring in front, small in back), you should be doing around 31 kph at 80 RPM, so chances are you're either spinning too fast in a too low gear or spinning too slow in a too high gear.
