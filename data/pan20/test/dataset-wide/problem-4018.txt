I am somewhat puzzled by your version of "Suslin stability theorem". What you are referring to is a combination of usual stabilization for $SK_1$ and an estimate for the stable rank of integer polynomials. Suslin's theorem states something much stronger, in particular Corollary 6.6 in his paper "On the structure of the special linear group over polynomial rings" is as follows (note that it doesn't depend on the number of variables): 

For each automorphism $\sigma$ of a root system $\Phi$ there is a unique automorphism of the Chevalley group $G(\Phi,R)$ such that $\sigma(x_\alpha(t))=x_{\sigma\alpha}(t')$. While conjugating by certain elements of the torus normalizer realizes the action of the Weyl group of $\Phi$, the automorphisms corresponding to the symmetries of the Dynkin diagram are not inner. However, it is sometimes possible to realize them as inner automorphisms of certain extended groups, e.g. $O_{2n}$ for $SO_{2n}$ (edit: none for $SL$). It can be seen explicitly in matrices for the above cases, but when working with the group of type $\mathsf{E}_6$, it becomes difficult to work with matrices. So I wonder if there is an invariant description? There is a general construction for extended groups, see [Berman, Moody, Extensions of Chevalley groups. Israel J. Math. 22 (1975), no. 1], but it is not clear, how to describe the desired inner automorphisms in its terms. 

The keyword for this is "Gauss decomposition". It states that for a ring R of stable rank 1 one can indeed write any element g of GL(n,R) as a product of three upper and lower triangular matrices (not unipotent, though). So it holds not only for finite fields, but for any field and, more generally, semilocal ring, along with many other examples such as the ring of all algebraic integers. And for GL one doesn't even require R to be commutative. I'm having trouble tracing the first appearence of this in the literature (but probably it goes back to the work of Bass), so here are two links: 

As you can see, this diagram gives no hint to how exactly the generators act inside the weight spaces. I guess this can be reconstructed from the desription of $V(\lambda)$ as a quotient of the Verma module, but this seems quite computationaly extensive, so I was wondering whether someone has already done it in some cases (say, for the untwisted affine KM algebras for some particular choice of $\lambda$)? 

Finite is semilocal, and semilocal rings always have stable rank 1 (even if non-commutative), as shown in Lemma 6.4 and Corollary 6.5 of Bass' "K-Theory and stable algebra". 

I apologize, if all of the above is trivial (or nonsense), but I am as far from being an expert in modular forms as possible. 

In general what you are asking about is the problem of $K_1$-stabilization, that is the study of maps $GL(n, R)/E(n, R)\to GL(n+1, R)/E(n+1, R)$. For rings of finite dimension all such maps are bijective starting with some $n$ depending on the dimension. The first relevant link is "On the stabilization of general linear group" by L. Vaserstein. I believe that any paper on the subject cites this one, so you can explore them by following the link. For the particular problem about polynomials over a division ring, take a look at "The general linear group of polynomial rings over regular rings" by T. Vorst. Here's the abstract: 

There are lots of ways to fix the signs of the structure constants, so I will just provide a bunch of references I use when needed: 

$SL(n, R)$ is indeed generated by the fundamental copies of $SL(2, R)$ when $R$ is a Bezout domain (or even a Hermitian ring), this is called Smith normal form. In fact, $SL(n, R)$ is not only generated by such subgroups, but is a product of $(n-1)^2$ fundamental copies of $SL(2, R)$. See $SL_2$-factorizations of Chevalley groups for the proof of a slightly weaker bound of $n^2-n$ factors in case $R$ is a Bezout domain. On the other hand, for any ring $R$ of stable rank at most $2$, one can express $SL(n, R)$ as a product of $\frac{1}{2}(3n^2-5n)$ copies of $SL(2, R)$. Here is a link. Even more, $SL(n, R)$ being generated by $SL(2, R)$'s is equivalent to the map $SL(2, R)/E(2, R)\to SL(n, R)/E(n, R)$ being surjective. The question whether it is so for a particular ring $R$ is known as the "surjective stability for $K_1$", and there are lots of papers on the subject. To put it short, in terms of dimension of $R$ the best one can get is "stable rank at most 2", but there are plenty of examples of geometric, arithmetic or analytic nature having stable rank greater than 2 (or not known). As for the last question, concerning the Kac—Moody groups of type $\widetilde{A}_1$, there is a paper by S. Sidki, but it deals with groups over fields. 

In a paper Finite simple groups as expanders by M. Kassabov, A. Lubotzky and N. Nikolov there is a theorem, stating that there exists $\varepsilon>0$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, such that for every non-abelian finite simple group of Lie type (except the Suzuki group) its Cayley graph with respect to some $k$ elements generating set is an $\varepsilon$-expander. Then there is a line: 

The proof is scattered over the extensive volume of literature and seems to have many places amenable to improvements, a lot of them concerning the resulting estimates. I wonder if anyone has managed to compile some sort of "dependencies tree": what effect does each part of the proof has on the bounds. An example: if $G=H_1H_2\ldots H_n$, and each subgroup $H_i$ is an $\varepsilon$-expander (w.r.t. $S_i$), then $G$ is an $\varepsilon'$-expander (w.r.t. $\cup_i S_i$). How exactly does $\varepsilon'$ depends on $\varepsilon$, $n$ and $|S_i|$? 

The complete answer to your question would contain the computation of $K_1$ for an arbitrary PID, so basically there are no chances. Howerer, it is easy to show that using the elementary transformation you can almost get the SNF. Namely, the usual procedure for Euclidian rings will fail in the setting of PID only in the last step, when you are facing the problem of simplifying a $2\times2$ matrix. So each coset contains a block diagonal matrix with only one block of size >1 (which is of size 2). The determinants of the blocks satisfy the same relation as $a_i$'s. 

Let $V(\lambda)$ be the unique irreducible representation of a Kac—Moody algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with the highest weight $\lambda$. If $\mathfrak{g}$ is not of finite type, then even for $\lambda$ one of the fundamental weights the weights of $V(\lambda)$ usually have multiplicities $\geqslant2$. 

Now all of the above is for the groups of normal types and you indicated you are interested in twisted groups such as ${}^2\mathsf{D}_\ell$. For those you can always fix the signs in the corresponding non-twisted groups and use the fact that the elementary generators of the twisted group are the products of the elementary generators over the orbits of roots — see the Steinberg lectures on the Chevalley groups (original mimeographic notes (PDF), TeXified version (PDF)) or Carters's Simple Groups of Lie Type. 

The space of all trace class operators on a separable Hilbert space having zero trace is naturaly a Lie algebra. Since it is yet another infinite dimensional analogue of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$, one might hope it shares some of its properties. Some sort of highest weight representations theory, perhaps (in the spirit of Kac`s "Bombay lectures")? Has this Lie algebra been studied? My google-fu is too weak, apparently. 

While reading "Automorphic Forms and L-functions for the Group $GL(n,R)$" by D. Goldfeld, I've got a feeling that linear groups over $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}$ are considered only as technical tools (beside their presence in the definitions). The author often uses various decompositions such as Iwasawa and Bruhat, Levi and Langlands decomposition of parabolic subgroups, Hermite and Smith normal forms and other straightforward matrix calculations. But I don't see if this works the other way around. The question is:
