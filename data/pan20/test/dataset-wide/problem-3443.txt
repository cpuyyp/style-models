Alecos is correct that Smith is talking about packaging, but I don't believe that "paper" refers to a paper bag. Straight pins used to be sold on sheets of paper (usually as sets of a dozen), through which they passed twice, like so: 

It's a direct result of how monetary policy is normally conducted. In normal-times monetary policy, the Fed will increase its target rate (the Fed Funds rate) by selling Treasuries to dealers, who will pay for them by withdrawing deposits they hold at banks. The cash that formed these deposits can therefore no longer be held as excess reserves at the Fed, which decreases the supply of funds in the Fed Funds market, increasing the price of borrowing funds (i.e., the Fed Funds rate). The reduction in bank reserves is actually the mechanism by which rates are increased; the sale of bonds is just a way of reducing reserves. Here's a reference. 

Demand for PLMBS (the source of which is an interesting story itself but this answer is long enough already) actually drove subprime mortgage originations, as noted by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (p. 87): 

Then, we can discuss the reasons for government provision of deposit insurance specifically, which are: 

perform credit, liquidity, or maturity transformation; and fund themselves through uninsured wholesale deposits (without recourse to liquidity facilities)? 

As I note in the discussion in the comments, zero dollars of QE were "lent" or "given"— QE consisted entirely of purchases of government and agency securities on the open market, at market prices. What QE does is change the mix of "safe assets" versus cash. There's nothing "frivolous" about it. 

Eurodollars are, by definition, held (on the liability side) inside the banking system. They're US dollar deposits held either outside the US or inside the US via an International Banking Facility. On the asset side, eurodollars are typically lent by nonbank financial institutions. This means that the eurodollar market links the two segments of financial markets: it's typically nonbanks providing short-term funding to banks. For an introduction to nonbank financial intermediation, I'd recommend "Shadow Banking" (Pozsar, et. al., 2010). 

If you're just trying to understand the volume of electronic transactions generally to an order of magnitude, it's in the quadrillions of dollars per year. According to this document from the US Treasury, SWIFT handles about \$5 trillion per day, or given about 250 business days per year, about \$1.25 quadrillion dollars a year. Similarly, CHIPS handles about \$400 trillion per year, and Fedwire handles around \$900 trillion per year (most of both of these arise out of SWIFT messages). These transactions make up a large fraction of electronic transactions in the world, so it's safe to assume that the global total isn't much more than a few quadrillion dollars a year. SWIFT payment message volumes are usually around 11.5 million per day, giving an average payment size of around \$45,000— though if one considers the structure of the payments system, it's evident that there's a very wide distribution of payments sizes, so this average isn't particularly representative. 

The data you're asking for doesn't exist. Most data on things like this are captured through the taxing authority, which means that there are entities that want to collect taxes and therefore care very much where you do something and where your inputs came from. That's very true when there are international borders involved, and it's true to a much lesser degree when there are state borders involved, but in the US, there's generally no administrative interest in tracking the flow of goods across county borders.

The ability to nominate up to two members to the board of directors of a participating institution, should the institution miss six quarterly payments to the Treasury, per the CPP contracts. Limits on executive compensation. These were in the authorizing law that Congress passed (titled the "Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008"), and they're well-described on the law's Wikipedia page: 

There is a good Planet Money episode on ticket scalping; I recommend it. The reason for banning ticket scalping has nothing to do with economic harm, and everything to do with making the arts (or sports, whatever) accessible to people of more-modest means. Consider the fact that artists could, if they wanted, just auction off all the seats to their shows, capturing all the surplus and putting scalpers out of business.* If artists did this, however, lots of people wouldn't be able to afford to see popular artists perform. Many artists (the Planet Money episode uses Kid Rock as an example) want to try to make sure that their fans have a reasonable shot at attending, which means that they want to price the tickets low... but the only way this can work is if resale is illegal. It's been suggested that artists (again, the same goes for sports teams) might benefit from making low-priced tickets available to fans for two reasons: because they plan on selling stuff to people once they're inside, and because an artist-fan relationship is hopefully not just a one-shot transaction. The idea is that fans who can attend the occasional show might be more likely to buy recordings, merchandise, and tickets in the future, providing the sort of long-running support that can keep an artist viable over many years. 

In your textbook, it says that given a certain money supply, the interest rate must increase if the demand for money increases. The money supply is determined by the central bank, which can buy bonds (which takes bonds out of circulation and increases the supply of money in circulation), or sell bonds (putting bonds in circulation but decreasing the supply of money in circulation). It can also, as in your example, do nothing. If the demand for money increases, then market participants are willing to either "buy" more money at a given price (where the "price" of money is the interest rate), or pay a higher price for a given amount of money. This is true of all goods— and so long as demand isn't either perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic, both are true. So since in your example the money supply is fixed (i.e., the supply curve is perfectly inelastic), if the demand for money increases, the interest rate will increase. The interest rate increasing as a result of increased demand for money isn't dependent on the central bank doing anything, it's dependent on the central bank doing nothing. In practice, central banks usually target a particular interest rate. When they do so, they can't directly observe the demand for money, but they can observe the equilibrium price (i.e., the interest rate). So what they do is engage in open-market operations— buying [or selling] bonds to increase [or decrease] the supply of money, in turn decreasing [or increasing] the interest rate until it is close to their target. 

The value of a tradeable good is equal to what the marginal buyer will pay for it. I will explain further, but first let me correct one misconception in your question. You state: 

Banks are strongly discouraged from borrowing from the Fed. Doing so is expensive and an indicator of institutional distress. 

Addressing your question directly, yes, the rate will necessarily decrease. The Fed's purchases of MBS were entirely MBS that were securitized by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). GSE MBS are not subject to credit risk, as the credit risk is guaranteed by the GSEs. Further, banks underwriting mortgages that are securitized through this channel aren't holding any credit risk— the only real risk they face is that if a loan that defaults is found to have underwriting defects, the originating bank can be forced to repurchase the loan from the GSE through which it was securitized. This repurchase risk isn't trivial, but it can be controlled in a number of ways (proper underwriting being foremost among them). As a result, the channel that you posit— bank perceptions of mortgage risk increasing, offsetting rate decreases brought about by QE— is not possible. Empirical evidence supports the above assertion— rates did in fact decrease. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen say: 

The capital injection program, known as the Capital Purchase Program (CPP), was authorized by Congress as a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and run by the US Treasury, not the Federal Reserve. However, the Federal Reserve Board and in particular the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY, primary regulator of the major dealer banks) were both involved in the design of the program. The program was voluntary, not mandatory, though the heads of the nine largest institutions were certainly strongly encouraged to participate, as described by Timothy Geithner, then-President of the FRBNY, in Stress Test: 

is correct as to the accounting; let me provide a little more intuition to it. GDP measures production (output), not sales— it is in the name: Gross Domestic Product. And for many firms, production into inventory, making a thing with the explicit intent of building inventories so that the thing is available for purchase when people want that thing, is a core part of the business. Imagine a firm that makes snow throwers— they build these machines year round, then basically sell all of them during a period from late fall through mid-winter (the exact seasonal pattern doesn't matter, only the fact that there is one). For the purpose of counting that firm's output in GDP, it should be clear why we want to recognize that they produced snow throwers all year, rather than having all that production only show up during the few months when the machines are actually sold. This approach isn't without its downsides— in the event that large volumes of production into inventory occurs because demand for the product in question has fallen off permanently, then the market price of the units sold will have been applied to a bunch of units that would never have sold at that price, and the value of output will be biased. This bias is of smaller magnitude than the mis-measurement that would be introduced by normal inventory fluctuations if we were only to count output when products are finally sold, though, so we live with it. 

@BB King's answer is good, but I want to make one point very clear: The Fed did not change the data. The Bureau of Economic Analysis revised the data as a part of its 2013 comprehensive revision process, which it engages in every five years using data from the most recent Economic Census. It may be worth noting that the BEA, which is the agency that is responsible for estimating US GDP, is housed in the US Department of Commerce, and as such is wholly independent of the Federal Reserve. The changes made in the 2013 comprehensive revision are discussed here, with a table showing annual changes on page 16. Note that the annual numbers shown in the article do not align with the numbers shown in the Fed's table because the BEA publishes percent change in annual real output, while the numbers used by the Fed in your links are showing the percent change in 4th-quarter real output, which can affect how the timing of changes appears. As a result, the major slowdown that occurred in 2008 Q4, for example, shows as a large drop in 2008 4th-quarter output and a small change in 2009 4th-quarter output using the quarterly comparison shown by the Fed, while it shows up as a small decrease in overall 2008 output and a large decrease in overall 2009 output using the annual numbers shown in the BEA's table. 

It is only possible if you also know the average fraction of income that is spent on housing in that area... and even then only if you assume either that rental costs per square foot are similar to ownership costs per square foot, or that the rent/buy decision is uncorrelated with income. So: not really. Rental costs are correlated with income, but there's a lot of error. 

No, as I said above. On an average day, bank borrowing from the discount window should be zero. Commercial paper represents medium-term borrowing by private companies. 

The answer offered by @MD-Tech is unfortunately profoundly wrong on a number of its core assertions. I will first correct these assertions (and offer references while doing so) and then very briefly offer a few points that should put the 2008 crisis in the proper perspective. TL;DR: Government guarantees on mortgages didn't play any role in the crisis; CDOs and CDS played a role in keeping the mortgage pipeline running as long as it did but private-label MBS were the security that played the central role in the crisis; and the actual reason that mortgage losses almost destroyed the global economy is that private-label MBS had been heavily funded using repo, which transformed mortgage debt essentially into a form of money, and when the market went south, it led to a run on wholesale bank funding that amounted to a massive contraction of the broader money supply. First, the errors: Error One: Implicit Government Guarantees In the (first?) Clinton and Bush administrations there was a political will (rightly or wrongly; it isn't important) to help people buy their own homes. This applied particularly to low income families who previously had not been able to buy, in many cases for generations. To do this bills were passed to offer subprime loans with the implicit backing of the US government. This assertion is untrue. No bills were passed in the 1990s to offer subprime loans with the implicit backing of the US government, and government-backed loan channels (including implicit backing) actually lost significant market share prior to the crisis. You might be thinking about the Community Reinvestment Act, which was blamed by some conservatives for the crisis, but this view is not held in high regard by economists. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Final Report has this to say on the matter (p. xxvii): 

What you're describing is a change in the capital account, not in GDP. They're related through the balance of payments, in that if a country is running a current account deficit (usually arising through being a net importer), they'll have a capital account surplus (i.e., foreigners will on net buy more domestic assets or domestic owners will be net sellers of foreign assets, or both), and vice-versa. So if you take foreign investment in domestic assets for example, it'll be associated with being a net importer, but it does not appear directly in the national accounting identity $Y=C+I+G+NX$.
