I don't have time to write a detailed answer but the following should help. Blast your sum with Newton's binomial formula. That gives a sum over three indices $i,j,k$. The three equations you get on these indices by fixing the monomial of interest are linearly dependent, so you are left with a sum over just one index say $i$. I believe what you get is a ${}_3F_{2}$ terminating hypergeometric sum. Your quantity of interest is also a Wigner $3jm$-symbol or Clebsch-Gordan coefficient from the literature on quantum angular momentum. In general, determining the zeros of such numbers is an open problem, see my article "The bipartite Brill-Gordan locus and angular momentum" with Jaydeep Chiplakatti for some references. If your case is sufficiently special (e.g., stretched coefficients) then you might be lucky enough to know if your coefficients are zero or not. 

$T\circ\Psi(v,w)=\Psi(v,\delta\ w)$. $\Psi$ takes its values in the unstable manifold. $\Psi(v,w)=\Psi(v_{*},L_{v}(w))$ where $L_v$ is a $v$-dependent linear map onto the unstable tangent space. 

The only reference that I know which does all that is the thesis of Xavier Fernique. The paper that came out of it is: "Processus linéaires, processus généralisés". Annales de l'institut Fourier, 17 no. 1 (1967), p. 1-92. However, it is in French and uses a lot of topological vector space machinery. Otherwise for $S'$ one can do that by hand. Use the isomorphism of $S$ with the space of sequences $$ \mathcal{s}=\{(x_n)_{n\ge 0}\in\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}\ |\ \forall k, ||x||_k<\infty\} $$ where $$ ||x||=\sup_{n\ge 0} \{(n+1)^k|x_n| \}\ . $$ The duality pairing between $y\in\mathcal{s}'$ and $x\in\mathcal{s}$ is given by $$ y(x)=\sum_{n\ge 0} y_n x_n\ . $$ Then follow similar steps for the proof of Levy's Convergence Theorem in finite dimension. The difficult step is in showing that if the characteristic functions of a sequence of probability measures $\mu_m$ in $\mathcal{s}'$ converge pointwise to a function which is continuous at the origin, then the sequence is tight. For this you can follow the discussion of Mitoma's Theorem (Thm 6.13) in the Saint Flour lectures notes by J. B. Walsh "An Introduction to Stochastic Partial Differential Equations" in Lect. Notes in Math. no. 1180. I suppose one can do the same for $D'$ using the Valdivia-Vogt isomorphism of $D$ with $\oplus_{\mathbb{N}}\mathcal{s}$ but I didn't try. 

Cumulants have many other names depending on the context (statistics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics,...): seminvariants, truncated correlation functions, connected correlation functions, Ursell functions... I would say that the $n$-th cumulant $\langle X_1,\ldots,X_n\rangle^{T}$ of random variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ measures the interaction of the variables which is genuinely of $n$-body type. By interaction I mean the opposite of independence. Denoting the expectation by $\langle\cdot\rangle$ as in statistical mechanics, independence implies the factorization $$ \langle X_1\cdots X_n\rangle=\langle X_1\rangle\cdots\langle X_n\rangle\ . $$ If the variables are Gaussian and centered then for instance $$ \langle X_1 X_2 X_3 X_4\rangle=\langle X_1 X_2\rangle\langle X_3 X_4\rangle +\langle X_1 X_3\rangle\langle X_2 X_4\rangle +\langle X_1 X_4\rangle\langle X_2 X_3\rangle $$ so the lack of factorization is due to $2$-body interactions: namely the absence of factorization for $\langle X_i X_j\rangle$. The $4$-th cumulant for variables with vanishing moments of odd order would be the difference $LHS-RHS$ for the previous equation. Thus it would measure the "interaction" between the four variables which is due to their conspiring all together instead of being a consequence of conspiring in groups of two at a time. For higher cumulants, the idea is the same. Cumulant are definitely related to connectedness. For instance for variables whose joint probability density is a multiple of a Gaussian by a factor $\exp(-V)$ where $V$ is quartic, one can at least formally write moments as a sum of Feynman diagrams. Cumulants are given by similar sums with the additional requirement that these diagrams or graphs must be connected. Some references: 

I don't know if this is exactly the answer you are looking for but for even $n$ this is clearly related to the result by Katsylo for moduli spaces classical binary forms or hyperelliptic curves, see this paper. Another link for accessing the article by Katsylo is this one. Theorem 0.2 therein seems to give a positive answer to your rationality question for all $n$ (even or not) except possibly for $n=10$ (or genus four hyperelliptic curves). I think this exception has been covered later by Bogomolov. Note that for $n=10$ now one has an explicit description for the ring (rather than just field) of invariants, see this article by Brouwer and Popoviciu. 

Edit: another application worth mentioning is to PDEs. In some badly ill-posed cases one can nevertheless prove almost sure global well-posedness if one has an invariant measure for the PDE. For the nonlinear Schrödinger equation on the 2D torus, these measures come from rigorous QFT: they are the $P(\phi)_2$ models studied by Nelson, Glimm, Jaffe and many others. This application to PDEs was developed by Bourgain in this article (see also this more recent work in the area). 

Let $\mathcal{P}=\{\infty, 2,3,5,7,11,\ldots\}$ be the set of primes of $\mathbb{Q}$ and let $\mathbb{Q}_p$ denote the corresponding completions, so in particular $\mathbb{Q}_{\infty}=\mathbb{R}$. Is it possible to give a definition of the spaces of test functions $S(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ together with their standard topologies (finest locally convex for $p$ finite and usual Frechet in the real case) in a completely uniform way with respect to $p\in\mathcal{P}$? It is not too hard to uniformly define $L^2(\mathbb{Q}_p, dx)$ as well as the Fourier transform as a unitary transformation on this space. The kind of definition I am looking for might look like: $S(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is the smallest subspace of $L^2$ which is invariant by Fourier transform and... insert mystery property here... 

Consider the infinite 3-regular tree. Pick a vertex $C$, the "center". For any integer $L\ge 1$ consider the closed ball, in the graph distance, of radius $L$ around $C$. Let $T_L$ be the induced subgraph on the set of vertices given by this ball. The finite tree $T_L$ rooted at $C$ has $L+1$ layers or generations. It has $3\times 2^L-2$ vertices and they all have degree $3$ except the $3\times 2^{L-1}$ leaves in the top layer. My question is: 

If I am not mistaken, for the exceptional values of the genus, the locus of degree $d$ plane curves has (complex) dimension $$ \frac{(d+2)(d+1)}{2}-9 $$ sitting inside a moduli space of dimension $$ \frac{3(d-1)(d-2)}{2}-3 $$ so it becomes relatively small as $d$ increases. This article by Landesman seems to be pertinent for your question. 

Also, another account from the physics point of view and related to José's answer, the Ricci flow and all that, is the article: 

I am looking for a good reference about the analogues of the Bochner Theorem and the Lévy Continuity Theorem for probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ with the product topology. Let $\mathscr{s}_0=\oplus_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}$, i.e, the space of sequences $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots)$ of real numbers with only finitely many nonzero terms. One can view this as a locally convex topological vector space using the finest locally convex topology, namely, the one defined by the set of all seminorms one can put on it. The strong dual is naturally identified with the previous product space so I will simply write $\mathscr{s}'_0=\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ and use the duality pairing $$ \langle y,x\rangle=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}y_n x_n $$ for all sequences $y\in \mathscr{s}'_0$ and $x\in\mathscr{s}$. Given a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathscr{s}'_0$ one defines the corresponding characteristic function $\Phi_{\mu}:\mathscr{s}_0\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with the usual formula $$ \Phi_{\mu}(x)=\int_{\mathscr{s}'_0} e^{i \langle y,x\rangle}\ d\mu(y)\ . $$ Bochner's Theorem says that $\mu\rightarrow\Phi_{\mu}$ is a 1-to-1 correspondence between Borel probability measures on the countable product $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ and functions $\Phi$ which satisfy: 1) $\Phi(0)=1$, 2) continuity at 0 in $\mathscr{s}_0$, 3) for all $n\ge 1$ and elements $x^{(1)},\ldots,x^{(n)}$ in $\mathscr{s}_0$ the matrix $\left(\ \Phi(x^{(i)}-x^{(i)})\ \right)_{1\le i,j\le n}$ is positive semidefinite. Lévy's Theorem says that a sequence of probability measures $(\mu_k)_{k\ge 1}$ converges weakly in $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ if and only if their characteristic functions $\Phi_{\mu_k}$ converge pointwise to some function $\mathscr{s}_0\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ that is continuous at the origin. Bochner's Theorem follows almost trivially from the very classic finite dimensional one (I got plenty of good references for that) and the Daniell-Kolmogorov Extension Theorem. The "almost" is because, rather surprisingly, one has to work a little to show continuity of characteristic functions because $\mathscr{s}_0$ is not metrizable (it is thankfully sequential). For Lévy's Theorem this amounts to proving: weak convergence in the infinite product space $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is equivalent to the weak convergence of the finite-dimensional marginals. Is there a good proof somewhere of this last fact? I looked at some standard probability textbooks and the classic by Billingsley but did not see this. I suppose I could try to imbed $\mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$ in the space $D[0,\infty)$ of cadlag functions considered by Billingsley, using functions that are constant on intervals $[n,n+1)$ but this seems a bit excessive to me. As I said in a comment below what matters most to me is a reference for the statement in bold. If your reference is a book, please give a precise pointer like "Theorem 2.31 in ref X".
