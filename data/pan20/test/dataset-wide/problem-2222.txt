For a national ranking to be meaningful, it is desirable to include as many tournaments as possible, so that a form peak - or injury - at the yearly national championship tournament has only limited impact. Typically, these rankings take into account the average or the best tournament results of the player. For instance, per §6 of the Indian Ranking System regulations, the ranking is determined by the sum of points gathered by the 6 best tournament finishes in the previous 52 weeks. If a player plays less than 6 tournaments, all of their points count (§6.1). In theory, the regulation could be changed to scale the average points, but that would mean that a player who wins the only tournament they competed in would immediately rank #1, which is not desired. Top-level badminton players like Saina Nehwal or P.V. Sindhu only play in the national championship tournament. The other national-level tournaments are not a challenge for them, conflict with international tournaments, or do not fit into their long-term training and rest plans; while competing in local tournaments would yield them small amounts of fame and money, it would severely reduce their chances at tournaments that really count. The Indian regulations do take this into account: 

In doubles, good players can easily cover he whole court, much easier than in singles, where a single person has to cover an only slightly smaller area. To win a rally against a good doubles pair, you need to pressure them with fast downwards shots, forcing them to make a mistake. To be able to play downwards, you need to force the opponents to play upwards, typically by playing shots to where they are not at the moment, so that they have to take the shuttle late. In this situation (taking the shuttle late, often just above the floor), playing short to the net would allow you to kill the shuttle immediately, so the least-worst option for your opponents is to play a high lift to the very back of the court. So whoever wins this fight for the lift will have an advantage, but they have not won the rally yet. When you are smashing the shuttle downwards from the back of the court, your partner should cover the front. This prevents your opponents from simply blocking the shuttle to the net, which would require you to lift. Concurrently, your opponents have to optimize their positioning to defend against your smash. A good smash is way too fast to intercept near the net, so they will stand side-by side at about the middle of the court, so that they can get to any smash immediately without having to step. The direction where the smash would fly the shortest distance is the most dangerous, so the player on the site of the shuttle will typically cover less space. Other considerations such as relative defensive skills, handedness and speed may also affect the defenders' positioning, but it will always be side-by-side. In summary, typical positions of attackers and defenders look like: 

What are the steps to becoming a recognized Badminton umpire, eventually at the Olympics? What resources are helpful in becoming a (good) umpire? 

While §13.3.1 of the laws of Badminton uses the word lands, §15.2 is much more precise (emphasis mine): 

As with all shots, you want to be behind the shuttle and on time so that you can do the full movement for a very powerful smash and don't have to reduce any part of the shot. That does not mean that you take the shuttle late though - obviously, the closer to the net you hit the shuttle the smaller the reaction time of your opponent. In order to unlock the full kinetic chain, you want to rotate your right (assuming right-handed, flip every side if left-handed) hip into the shot, you should start with your right foot behind your left one. The point of contact should be just in front of you and as high as possible without having to fully stretch your arm. For an ideal smash (e.g. the world record), you also want to jump. The advantage of jumping is two-fold: First of all, the higher point of contact allows you steeper - and just more - angles, which are harder to defend. Secondly, by changing your center of gravity (a little bit like this cat), you can unlock additional momentum. To get the most power, grab the racket at the bottom of the handle. Use the V grip, tightening the grip just before impact. This answer only gives an overview about positioning. The correct hitting technique is a precondition for a good shot. And naturally, (the right kind of) strength helps as well. That's why professional players can hit amazing shots in very bad positions, i.e. behind the body. Have a look at the various online resources for more details. To get a feeling for the whole action and understand details better than text can allow, it may also be beneficial to closely study professional player's smashes. 

Assuming the shuttle side hit the shuttle last, you have to evaluate what happened first - per §15.3, the first fault ends the rally. 

Depends on the sport and discipline (e.g. it's fine in swimming), but often not. In Beach Volleyball, men's pants must be at least 20cm long. 

At the 2016 All-England finals, Wang Shixian was shown a yellow and a red card. This Guardian article even has a picture of a black card. What do these cards mean, and when are they typically shown? 

Summary In Beach Volleyball, the default clothing is indeed strikingly different and far more revealing for women. Women may wear more modest clothing citing religious or cultural reasons, but have to request permission for these. Men are not allowed not wear more revealing (or more modest) clothing. In Gymnastics, the laws are really complicated, because there is a multitude of disciplines. Generally, women seem to have more options. In Swimming, men must wear more revealing clothing. Beach Volleyball Here are the generic rules of the game. Those are gender-independent (see §4.3). The competition regulations (which in FIVB's case also contain 2016 olympic regulations) are quite explicit though (§4.4): 

While the shuttle is in flight, the latter rule does not apply. Per §15.1, only if the shuttle is caught in the net and starts to drop down, the fault is called. So much for the shuttle side. When the racket touches the net, it's a fault as well: 

Not explicitly, but this can follow from gender-specific as well as gender-independent clothing regulations. 

In the final game of a double-elimination tournament, the last remaining team of the top bracket plays against the last remaining team in the bottom bracket. Double-elimination tournaments require at the very least 4 teams, so you cannot meaningfully extend the term to a tournament with 2 teams. Therefore, it would be very confusing and misleading to use the term double-elimination game; the correct term for what you have in mind is the final game of a double-elimination tournament, or simply [tournament] finals. 

There are some aspects where some rackets are better than others, namely average durability and price. Some properties do not effect play, but are considered anyways: style/coloring and marketing. In summary, there is no best racket. The best racket for a given player depends a lot on the player's technique, playing style, preferences and personal feeling. Most players will play fine with a any good racket, especially if the new racket's properties are similar to their usual racket. 

At high-level tournaments (sometimes only on TV courts), the HawkEye Instant Review System (IRS, informally challenging) allows players - or if neither line judge nor umpire could see the shuttle, the umpire - to challenge line judges' and umpires' decisions. It is regulated by appendix 7 of the laws. As long as the challenges are successful in overturning the line judge's decision, players can challenge as often as they want. To prevent abuse, each side is limited to two unsuccessful challenges per game (until 2015 per match). Players must challenge immediately after the decision, and must not consult with coaches - so when you see an umpire denying a challenge, the player took to long to decide whether to challenge. Typically, players will raise one finger to indicate that they are challenging. The umpire will then raise their left arm to indicate to the referee that a challenge has been made. With the help of the HawkEye system, an off-court umpire (on IRS duty) will review the footage and make a decision that gets relayed to umpire and audience. In case of an unsuccessful challenge, the umpire will announce the (unchanged) score and how many challenges are remaining. In case of a successful challenge, the umpire will announce the corrected score. IRS is not available on every line; the service lines are not covered by current implementations due to cost reasons. Also, only line calls can be challenged. Any fault or let calls are final. In the future, a similar system may be available for service fault calls, and may be fully automated so that a decision can be made immediately, whereupon the procedures laid out above are likely to change. 

If a player is misbehaving in some way, Badminton umpires have four ways to react: Umpires can issue a verbal warning. In case of delay (the most common infraction), umpires repeat the score in minor cases, and add a Play announcement to signal the second level of warning. At the next level of escalation, umpires will ask the player to come to the umpire chair in order to talk to them. A couple of common warnings are formalized in the vocabulary, for example You must not delay the game, but umpires can be more precise if necessary. As a final warning, umpires sometimes point to their cards or inform the player that a card is imminent. In case of a repeat offense after a major verbal warning, or a more major offense (e.g. seeking coaching input while the shuttle is in play, or throwing the racket without endangering anyone), the umpire will show a yellow card. A yellow card has no effect at all apart from a monetary penalty: In international play, the third yellow card in a year costs 500$; all subsequent yellow cards 250$. National regulations may vary - for example, in the German Bundesliga it's just 50€. Every side can only be shown one yellow card per match. In case a side has already been shown a yellow card but still commits an infraction, a red card will be shown. A red card is also called fault for misconduct. The opposing side gets one additional point, as if they'd won a rally. Apart from repeated infractions (a yellow-worthy offense after a yellow card), major offenses such as cussing at the umpire/opponent, throwing a racket anywhere near people, not showing up after an interval etc. are cause for a red card. A red card also comes with larger fines, 500$ at international levels. The umpire will also call the referee to discuss whether a black card is in order. If referee and umpire agree to disqualify a player, the referee will hand a black card to the umpire, and the umpire can then show it to the player in question. Black cards are only shown for very major infractions, such as losing intentionally, hitting opponent or umpire with the racket and the like. A black card entails disciplinary action by the BWF or national federation. For more information about the procedure and infractions, refer to the Recommendations to Technical Officials(RTTO) and §16 of the Laws. Note that all kinds of warnings can also be handed out before or after the matchRTTO 3.7.7, for instance when a player misbehaves upon losing. Bear in mind that Badminton players are usually good sportsmen. Cards are very rare compared to other sports. At national levels, tournaments will often finish without a single card. At international levels, I estimate that cards are only shown in about 1% of matches. In particular, black cards are exceptionally rare - the last one at international levels dates back to 2013.

The defenders can play high lifts to the back of the court again, but in order for them to win, they are trying to get into the attack themselves. This, finally, is where rotation comes into play: By playing to where the attackers aren't, i.e. between the attacking players, to the sides at the net, or flat shots to a side of the rearcourt, the defenders force the attackers to move around the court. When the defenders find a hole in the attack, the attackers may have to lift the shuttle themselves, and now become the attackers. Both sides then have to reposition to the then-optimal positions. Because a doubles player will roughly speaking always cover the opposite half of the court to where their partner is, this repositioning is called rotation. To get a better feel for doubles strategy in general and the rotation it entails, watch high-level doubles matches. 

The referee handles general tournament organization, extraordinary situations on court, and also supervises the other technical officials. Tournament organization includes, among many others, basic scheduling, informing officials and team managers of any tournament-specific details, shuttle testing, checking that courts and equipment are in order, selecting and evaluating umpires etc. . At larger tournaments, there is usually one head referee and multiple deputy referees, working together as a team. The referee team is typically seated next to tournament control. Normally, referees wear red uniforms. Referees come on court in case of injury, significant disputes, and extraordinary misconduct. Otherwise, the court and its surroundings is the domain of the umpire, clothed in black, and typically sitting on a high umpire chair. The umpire keeps track of the score, calls any faults (e.g. shuttle touching a player, or receiver moving too early) and lets (e.g. receiver not ready, shuttle from another court flying on court), and communicates with the players. The service judge sits opposite the umpire on a normal chair. As the name indicates, he or she is mainly calling service faults so that the umpire can focus on the receiver. They also hand out new shuttles. Service judges are qualified umpires and thus wear a black uniform; umpires typically take turn in filling in either role. For more information on the hand signals by the service judge, refer to §7 of the the Instructions To Technical Officials (ITTO). The ITTO also contain lots of guidance for the other officials. Some large tournaments also had a third umpire per match who is manning the Instant Review System (IRS). When a player challenged a close line call, the IRS umpire made the decision, typically in an aside room or section away from court. These days, the IRS is usually fully automated. Finally, the team of line judges is responsible for all line calls. At the top tournaments, umpires often fill in as line judges as well, but many international tournaments also have local volunteers. A line judge uniform is typically provided by the tournament organizer, often monochromatic blue or green. Two of the line judges - on at each side of the court - are also responsible for mopping the court in case of excessive sweat/dust/feathers accumulations. The number of officials varies depending on the tournament importance. The full complement of referee, multiple deputy referees, umpire, service judge, 12 line judges and 2 mopper line judges is only reached at the very top tournaments (SuperSeries and Olympics). If officials are missing, their role is subsumed by another official. For instance, at national-level events, umpire and service judge often function as line judges for the lines they are sitting on, and one line judge presides over the back doubles service line, the back base line, and also mops the court if required. Depending on the tournament organization and/or national federation, shirt colors can also vary. 

If team B (Bob and Bella) win the rally, Bella will serve to Alex, from her left side. If team A win the next rally after that, Alex will serve to Bella, from his left side. If team B wins the next rally after that, Bob will serve to Alice, from his right side. If team A wins the next rally after that, we have completed the cycle, and Alice will serve again to Bob, from her right side. When the serving team wins a rally, the server switches sides and continues to serve§11.3.1. For instance, if team A wins the first serve, Alice will now serve again, from her left, to Bella. If team A wins the next rally, Alice serves from the right, to Bob. This continues on and on; Alice keeps serving until team B wins a point or the game is over. If that sounds complicated, there is a very helpful rule to remember: If the score of the serving team is even, they serve from the right. If the score of the serving team is odd, they serve from the left. For example, if team B wins the first rally, the score is 1-0. Since 1 is odd, the team serves from the left, where Bella is standing at the moment, so she's serving. If you prefer a more interactive demo, I've set up one here. Simply click to see what happens when one of the teams scores. The original laws referenced throughout this answer, download them from the Badminton world federation. Note that this explanation applies to the current 3x21 and the experimental 5x11 rally-point systems - before 2006, the rules were different.
