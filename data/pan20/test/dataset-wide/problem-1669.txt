My first thought after seeing your question was surprise that it was being asked, as I had heard the claim previously, and found it so much in agreement with my experience that I had assumed it true. However the evidence is actually rather more interesting than I would have guessed. Key results: 1. There are fewer fluent bilinguals than monolinguals in the world 2. There are close to the same number of people with basic proficiency in a second language as there are people with proficiency in only one. I'll start with the common sense argument you asked for: My experience is that anyone under 40 in Europe is likely to speak English, anyone I meet from India or Pakistan speaks English plus Urdu or Hindi, and significant fractions of the population in the US and China speak at least two languages (Often Spanish in the US, English and/or at least two Chinese dialects in China). However, looking into it more formally, it seems there are some problems with the definition of "speaking" a second language. This article has an interesting summary of the issues that arise in counting multilingual individuals. For instance, in the US, you're multilingual if you have some level of basic proficiency in a second language. In Switzerland, you're multilingual only if you have something like native proficiency in at least two. While most Swiss people I've met speak excellent English, as well as Swiss German and High German (indeed, most of them have received multi-year formal education in French, English, and High German), apparently most of them would claim to be monolingual on a census form. After floating around google scholar for a while, I conclude that these sorts of ambiguities on the parts of governments mean there isn't a good scientific estimate. We won't be able to get the exact numbers. Fortunately, someone else already has made a good effort at an educated guess for fluent bilinguals, and is cited widely in the literature I did read. In 1997, George Weber published an article in a semi-scholarly setting on the relative "strength" of different languages. You can read a copy of it here. Among other things, this article considers a number of different estimates of the number of speakers of each language, including the total number of secondary speakers for the most popular ones, and presents a sort of "consensus" estimate from these different sources. This consensus estimate is widely cited elsewhere in the scholarly literature, despite it not being from a truely scholarly source. Here's the pertinent graph: 

There is no evidence that cannabis consumption increases the risk of culpability for injury or death while driving, and that in fact, such risks may be slightly reduced. (CI for the odds ratio includes 1.0, but with mean below it). There is evidence that there may be an interaction between cannabis an alcohol, which impairs drivers more than either drug alone, and leads to increased accident risk. However, this relationship is unclear, in part because of confounding factors like frequent misclassification caused by police preferentially attributing fault to drivers under the influence (as opposed to the other party in an accident), and to delays in blood testing which make it difficult to determine whether a party was in fact experiencing the symptoms of cannabis exposure at the time of the accident, or not (the exponential decay means that even small errors in the test equipment can produce large errors in the estimated time of consumption). Cannabis consumption might lead to an increased risk of minor accidents (these being less rigorously reported and recorded). However, the evidence for this claim is not conclusive. 

There seem to be two parts to this question. First: "Have US drone strikes killed thousands of non-combatiant civilians between 2001 and 2013?". The answer is probably, though likely not the full 6,000 you mention. The best source for this is The Bureau of Investigative Journalism's database. The Bureau uses a well designed and publicly avaliable methodology to count the number of people killed by drone strikes year to year. In total, they count approximately 3,500 people killed by US drone strikes. Of these, only between 500 and 1000 deaths could be confirmed as "civilians", though the organization makes note of the fact that the US government may overuse the term "Militant" when describing causalities, and many victims cannot be confirmed either way. A further ~1,250 civilians were confirmed injured. A visualization of this database is available here. It is possible (perhaps even likely) that the actual number of deaths is higher. This data establishes only a lower bound. A US senator, presumably with inside knowledge of the program, claimed in 2013 that the actual number (of both military targets and civilians) killed exceeds 4,700. Second: "Is the US killing these civilians to terrorize the associated populations?" The answer is much more subjective, but I think probably not. First, I define terrorism according to what I believe is the conventional definition. A terror attack is one that explicitly targets civilian, rather than military, targets. The intention behind such an attack is to inspire terror in the civilian population. I do not think the attacks conform to this definition, but it is a contentious issue, in part because of the subjective nature of the terms involved. The Guardian has a nice summary, including graphics, up here, based on the report of Human Rights advocacy group Reprieve, which is in turn based on the Bureau's database pointed at above. Approximately 1,000 reported civilian deaths by drone strike are attributed to attempts by the US government to kill specific individuals, associated in one way or another with the US government's "War on Terror". For instance, attempts to kill eminent figures in Al Qaeda or the Afghanistani Taliban. The human rights organization points out that an average of 28 civilians are killed for each military target, which seems like a large number. However, it seems indisputable that the targets of the strike were military in nature. On a more editorial note: it is probably not in US interest to inspire terror in the civilian populations of Yemen or Pakistan. Both groups are already hot spots for recruitment into organizations the US is trying to eliminate. Presumably then, these deaths are examples of collateral damage. Of course, there is a moral question of whether the intentions of the US government negate the effects of their drone strikes, but I think it's hard to ascribe terror as a motive here. 

Disclaimer: I'm not your doctor, and further, I'm not any kind of doctor. Talk to one before you make medical decisions. However, I do have scientific and research training, and can assess the quality of the scientific evidence on this question. There does not appear to be any current evidence for the effectiveness of Tonsilotren in treating any condition. For instance, a google scholar search for "Tonsilotren" returns no scholarly works at all. At present, there is a clinical trial (mentioned in DVK's comment above) which is exploring the effect of Tonsilotren for the treatment of tonsillitis. However, the description of this study explicitly states that it has no formal hypothesis. Further, the study is not blinded at all (i.e. there is no placebo control for Tonsilotren, and both the patients and the doctors know who is getting it, and who is not). The study is funded by the German Homeopathy Union. All that said, most or all of the ingredients mentioned (though, as far as I can tell, not in exactly that combination or dosage level) have individually been shown to provide relief of pharyngitis by some studies. Other studies have found that they perform no better than placebo. A 2011 meta-study of these issues here summarizes these contradictory findings, but concludes with the upbeat message that, at least at low dilution levels, at least some homeopathic treatments might do something useful for ENT problems. A related meta-study from 2006 focuses only on ENT treatment with homeopathic medication, and reaches somewhat similar conclusions. However, both meta-studies note that the current state of science for homeopathic medicine is somewhat lacking, because most homeopathic doctors are not interested in a scientific approach to research, and there is relatively little funding for independent study of the subject (i.e. studies not funded by homeopathic medical suppliers). Consequently, I remain pretty skeptical of this work, although I cannot rule out the possibility that, in these low-dilution doses, these medicines might be helpful for treating pharyngitis. I'd personally summarize the state of evidence as something akin to a cure suggested by rural grandparents. There might be something to it (your grandparents weren't born yesterday, and their past experience says it works), but there's not rigid scientific evidence that it works better than a placebo. 

They certainly do not create more particulate emissions, but they might not create that much less than a gasoline powered car, depending on the model of car considered. First, what was previously thought? According to point IV.a.55 of this report the council of Europe's standing committee on Science and Technology, electric vehicles produce no fine particulate emissions. The report is dated 1998 however, so things may have changed since. The new study (perhaps article' would be better? It's a think tank's internal publication, not peer reviewed) can be read in full here (google translate did a pretty good job this time), but you need to look at the Dutch version for the graphs. The very first section already answers our question. The author never claims that electric cars produce more particulate emissions than ordinary cars. The title of the section says it all: "Electric cars produce almost as much particulate matter (PM) [as] modern petrol or diesel cars". The first graph in this section solidifies this. The electric cars considered all have lower total PM emissions than any of the similarly sized cars that are not EVs, though only modestly lower for the most part. A small gasoline car produces slightly less emissions than a medium sized EV however. Figures 3 and 4 suggest that the reason the advantage is so small now is because tighter emissions standards have dramatically reduced PM from cars over the last 25 years. So when the council of Europe report was written, it probably was fair to say that electric vehicles had no PM emissions at all (as compared to existing gasoline powered cars), but this is apparently no longer true. The last part of the section concerned with emissions seems very badly done to me, and at best is educated speculation. The author tries to mathematically compute an estimate for the increase in PM emissions from the extra weight of an electric car, but uses an unsourced formula with very nice round numbers, that I believe is likely to have been made up on the spot (33.33% factors for everything?). Even this slipshod analysis finds that the electric version of a normal family car is no worse than the gasoline version for PM emissions, and smaller EVs are much better. On the whole, I think the news story ought to have been: "Emissions Standards so Good that Gasoline Cars Now Competitive with EVs!" which is still exciting, but doesn't mislead the reader into thinking this was always the case, or that it's an argument against EVs in and of itself (remember, EVs are unchanged at the level of PMs that Council of Europe considered to be zero. It's that gasoline powered cars have dropped by > 75% for gasoline, and even more for diesel since the report was written).
