These articles, unfortunately, provide no sources. They are not a copy-and-pastes of each other. This "fact" was even picked up by a recent article in the Tampa Bay Tribune. However, this cannot actually be true, since the New York Knicks did not begin until 1946. I think this is just a matter of some article somewhere putting out this "fact" and everyone else just assuming it is true. But I haven't been able to determine what the original source is. 

The bikes used in cycleball are fixed-gear bikes. On most bikes, there is a flywheel that allows you to stop pedaling while you are moving and coast, but with a fixed-gear, the pedals are chained together with the rear wheel in such a way that the pedals always move whenever the rear wheel is moving. This is important in cycleball for a couple of reasons. First, unlike a conventional bike, it is possible to go backwards simply by pedaling backwards. Second, a fixed-gear allows the rider to hold the back wheel still by keeping the pedals still so he can balance the bike better while stopped, similar to what a unicyclist does. Besides the fixed-gear, there are a few other things that are unique to a cycleball bike: 

Nine-ball pool meets this criteria, and is currently played in tournament settings. In Nine-ball, unlike in the standard Eight-ball pool that more people are familiar with, anytime a player puts the nine-ball in the pocket with a legal shot, that player wins. It doesn't matter how many other balls either player has gotten in. Player A could pocket the first eight balls, but if Player B puts in the nine-ball, Player B is the winner. Nine-ball really has no score; a single event wins the game, and it can happen at any time. In Eight-ball pool, there is actually a progression to the game, and one player can be ahead of the other. However, the player that is behind can still instantly win the game if the player that is ahead pockets the eight-ball prematurely. You might think of this as more of an instant-lose event rather than an instant-win. If you want to count instant-lose scenarios, there are a number of sports (races, for example) where the person that is ahead can disqualify themselves by breaking rules, and the person behind can win. 

A block occurs when a front-row player close to the net reaches higher than the net and contacts the ball as it is coming over from the opponent. A block attempt is when the blocker reaches higher than the net but does not contact the ball, and a completed block is when the blocker does make contact with the ball. Block contacts can be by more than one player and consecutive, as long as it is all one action. So if the ball is coming over, and two different players jump up and both make contact with the ball, it is one block. This is important because block contacts are not counted as team hits. So after the block contact, if the ball stays on the blocker's side, the team still gets three hits. A blocker can reach over the net, but they are not allowed to interfere with an opponent's play. Basically, this means that the blocker cannot touch the ball until an opponent has made an attack hit. To address your scenarios, if the block prevents the ball from coming on to the blocker's side and the ball remains in play, it is still considered a block. The blocker touching the ball resets the team hit count, and the opposing team gets another three team hits. The rules on blocks are found in Chapter 14 of the FIVB Official Volleyball Rules, which are the rules used in Olympic play. 

As you said, Los Angeles is the second largest city in the US, so it seems ridiculous that they do not have an NFL team. There are lots of opinions as to why this is the case. In the last few years that the Rams and the Raiders were in LA, both teams were struggling, both on the field and financially. They both played in aging stadiums, and neither were successful in obtaining a new stadium in the area. The reasons why both teams struggled financially are debatable. One reason could be that there aren't enough football fans to support two teams. (They both left the same year, so this is hard to disprove.) Another reason could be that, with 6 other major league sports teams in the area, the sports market is already saturated. Any team that would move to LA would need a new stadium; a team would not move there to play at the Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, or any other old stadium in the area. This is a hurdle, as both the Rams and the Raiders were unable to get a stadium built. As time passes, it will be more likely that funding for a new stadium will be able to be obtained. Today, LA is used as a threat by NFL teams seeking new stadiums. The Buffalo Bills are one of the latest teams to consider LA. Tim Graham, writing for the Buffalo News, wrote an article outlining reasons why he thinks that the time is not right for an NFL team in LA. Among these reasons are an unfavorable business climate in California and a lack of public enthusiasm in funding a new stadium. It seems to happen every year: a team threatens to go to LA if they don't get a new stadium, and the public funds the stadium to prevent the team from going to LA. At the end of this upcoming season, the Rams, Raiders, and Chargers, all of whom have been in LA in the past, have expiring stadium leases. They will all undoubtedly use LA as a bargaining chip in their stadium negotiations. If not one of these teams, it seems inevitable that at some point in the future, a team will move to LA to give it a try. 

There are multiple official rule books for 8-Ball. However, I believe that WPA, APA, and VNEA rules all agree on this. Assuming that the 8-ball pocket was called correctly, and that the 8-Ball was the first ball contacted by the cue ball, and that no other fouls were committed, it doesn't matter that the opponent's ball was struck and pocketed by the 8-ball. The shooter wins the rack. 

A fighter is grounded anytime they have more than just the soles of their feet on the ground. If they have so much as a finger or a shin on the ground, they are grounded. Also, if they are leaning on the cage fence, and would be on the ground if it weren't for the cage holding them up, they are also considered grounded. From the Association of Boxing Commissions Unified Rules of MMA, Fouls section: 

In order for a country to send a team to the Olympics, the country needs a National Olympic Committee (NOC) that is recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). There are over 200 recognized NOCs, and Wikipedia has a list of all the recognized NOCs, sorted by the date the NOCs formed. Under the current IOC rules, which were changed in 1996, new NOCs will only be recognized from nations that are recognized as an independent country by the United Nations. However, before 1996, the IOC allowed NOCs from countries that were dependent territories of other nations, and these NOCs are allowed to continue. Therefore, in the Olympics, you will see athletes from countries like Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and Hong Kong, which are all territories of other nations. Currently, there are only two UN recognized countries that do not yet have NOCs: Vatican City and Niue. There are unofficial NOCs that are not recognized by the IOC from various territories and groups of people, and Wikipedia lists some of those. Some of these participate in the Paralympic games, but under the current rules they are not eligible for inclusion in the Olympics. 

1934 was the year that the Portsmouth Spartans moved to Detroit and became the Detroit Lions. Since the sweater is blue and silver, which are the Lions' colors, I believe that the sweater commemorates the first year of the Detroit Lions. The picture on the sweater is probably based on a 1934 Detroit Lions team photo (perhaps just part of the photo, since it does not appear to be a complete team), but so far I have been unable to find the photo on the internet. 

You get two bounces. The third consecutive time the ball goes from your five-rod to the wall (or side strips), you are not allowed to touch the ball with your five-rod again until it hits another man first. The penalty for a Three Wall Violation is a loss of ball. The other team gets to serve the ball from their five-man rod. 

The dance competition you linked to is an amateur competition. However, there are professional dance competitions with prize money, such as the United States Dance Championships. 

In addition to the material change, the diameter of the ball is changing slightly. Celluloid balls were required to be between 39.50 and 40.50mm, and the new plastic balls need to be between 40.00 and 40.60 mm. The new balls are controversial. Many of the old plastic balls (before 2014) were not reviewed well. They did not meet ITTF requirements and were more prone to breaking than celluloid balls. ITTF claims that all of the plastic balls that were approved this year (the first plastic balls were approved on January 24, 2014) are better than the older plastic balls. As more tournaments using the plastic balls occur, time will tell what changes the new balls introduce to the sport. ITTF is still approving celluloid balls, and they may still be used for non-ITTF sanctioned events. If you have an ITTF-approved ball in your hand and are unclear if you have a celluloid or plastic ball, the plastic balls have "40+" printed on them. Celluloid balls have "40" printed without the "+" character. ITTF has published a Q&A fact sheet on the new plastic balls (pdf). 

The point values were chosen to give the desired relative weight between a free throw (1 point), a field goal (2 points), and a three-point goal (3 points). Originally, when Dr. James Naismith invented the game of basketball in 1891, goals were worth one point each. Three consecutive fouls by one team (without the opposing team committing a foul) gave the opposing team one goal. From Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball: 

From the 2013 Official Playing Rules of the NFL, Rule 4, Section 8 (Extension of a Period or a Half): 

During the Parade of Athletes, the first team to enter the stadium is always Greece, in honor of the fact that the Olympics has its origin in ancient Greece. The last team in is the host country. The rest of the teams enter the stadium in alphabetical order, according to the language of the host country. This is why teams are in a different order in each Olympics. In 2004, when the Olympics were held in Athens, Greece, the Greek flag bearer, weightlifter Pyrros Dimas, entered the stadium first alone, leading the parade. The rest of the Greek athletes entered as the last team in the parade. The International Olympic Committee has published a factsheet outlining the elements of the opening ceremony. 

This is turning out to be a very interesting question. Doing some research, I have found a few different sources claiming that sports bobbleheads got their start in the 1920s with the New York Knicks: 

Dick's Sporting Goods High School Nationals Tournament (originally called the National High School Invitational) began in 2009. In the boys tournament, there are two schools that have won the title 3 times: Findlay Prep (NV) in 2009, 2010, and 2012; and Montverde Academy (FL) in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Oak Hill Academy (VA) has only won the title once, in 2016. For the girls, two schools have won the title twice: Dr. Phillips (FL) in 2011 and 2013, and Riverdale Baptist (MD) in 2012 and 2014.

As Benjamin Hoffman explained for the New York Times baseball blog, 42 is just one of Robinson's numbers: 

The theory is that crowd noise hurts the offense and helps the defense, which is most critical on 3rd down, where the offense is usually facing their last chance for a 1st down. The offense has to coordinate several things in order to make a successful play. The play caller (usually the head coach or offensive coordinator) needs to select a play from the sidelines and communicate that play to the quarterback, usually via a headset radio. The quarterback then has to communicate that play to the rest of the offense, usually verbally in a huddle. Finally, the quarterback may need to change the play at the line, which he communicates by yelling an audible call to the team. Loud crowd noise can disrupt any of these communications. Teams like Seattle and Minnesota have a reputation for having very loud stadiums. Seattle believes in the advantage that their crowd gives them so much that they refer to the fans as the "12th Man" and have retired jersey number 12 in honor of the fans. Minnesota and other stadiums have been accused of pumping amplified crowd noise through stadium loudspeakers to gain an advantage. In 1989, the NFL felt so strongly about the disadvantage that the visiting offense faced that they instituted a penalty for excessive crowd noise, issued against the home defense. The referees in enforcing the rule could take away timeouts and issue penalties, 5 yards at a time, until the crowd quieted down. The new rule also banned stadiums from encouraging noise via announcements. The rule was not very popular, and officials eventually stopped enforcing the rule. The penalty was officially dropped from the rulebook in 2007, and video scoreboard announcements encouraging noise were allowed again in 2013. A sound effect played by the stadium before a third down is simply a cue to the crowd that the visiting team is in a third down situation and that they should be loud to help their team. Different stadiums have different traditions for these sound effects: Denver has a bronco neighing, Minnesota has a Viking horn, Jacksonville has a jaguar roaring. They usually play these after a good play by the home team, but they can also be used to alert the crowd to a third down situation.
