Many answers address the heat transfer rates of air and of people's bodies. I'd like to point out that people will freeze much more quickly if the magicians can also make the air in their victims' lungs drop to absolute zero, not just the air around their victims. Freezing flatuses in the intestines would speed things up too, but that would just be gross. What about freezing the oxygen carried by the hemoglobin in the victims' blood? That would reduce the freezing time significantly! I don't think it's gaseous air at that point, so you'd need to decide whether that would be too much of a stretch to your characters' magical powers -- or whether you'll just save that trick for the final boss-battle of your story! 

This person could have the ability to change anyone he/she sees so that other person can no longer hurt another person, and no longer wants to. The hero's ability could affect people he sees in photos or on video - so a live stream video of a whole area of unrest would allow the hero to change all those people. Some people would want to avoid this person, or avoid being seen by this person, so they could continue to be evil. But their "foot soldiers" would all be disabled if seen, so the bad leaders' ability to sow discontent would get more and more limited. 

The runes' spell could work only during a particular timeframe. In my current office (in the real world), I was sent a link to an important file. The link would only work for 24 hours after I received the email. Your rune could do the same thing; create it so the magic only works for 24 hours after it's emailed to the recipient. 

A large, deep valley with sheer walls, such as Yosemite Valley in California, USA, should only be accessible from the two ends of the valley. The Yosemite National Park website says it is a "deep excavation created by earlier glaciers". 

Spray the buildings across the city with something flammable first (most likely a liquid, possibly a heavy flammable gas). That will handle David Z's point that "cities do not spontaneously explode". Once the center of the area is ignited, the fire / explosions should travel outward like the Independence Day explosion. Note that in Independence Day, the ship hovering over the city has a diameter of several miles. It could cover all of San Francisco with flammable liquid simultaneously. 

I think you need to define 'magic' first. What would seem magical to a child of 7 might not seem so to a physics professor or an engineer. If you'd told an educated 17th-century European that he could see someone on the other side of the world this morning, talk to him, hear him, as if he were in the same room - that might indeed seem magical to him. Then to clinch it, tell him he and this other man could have breakfast together in the same room, at the same table, passing food back and forth to each other. That would seem beyond magical. But to your daughter? Ho hum. So what would she call magical? Probably the ability to be in more than one place at the same time would be the most impressive. Then the ability to know the future in precise detail. Those two are about as magical as you can get. For the first, you'd need to be able to violate the conservation of matter and energy. For the second, you'd also have to violate the laws of entropy. When you violate these, you've trampled over the law of cause and effect, and then nothing at all remains of physics. Which goes to show that if you abandon the smallest part of physics, you lose all of it. I am not saying that we know or understand all of physics, but we have reached a stage where we can say that what we have may be incomplete, but it's an integrated, unified structure with no spare parts to jettison. So you and your daughter have to accept - it's physics or magic, but not both, and you'd better both hope it's physics. 

The OP makes it clear that he's referring to sex, and not gender, so let's leave all discussion of gender to one side. Sexual reproduction supercharges evolution. it allows the assortment of genetic materials from two individuals to produce the genome of a third, new, individual, thus ensuring that there are new genes (produced by mutation) and new assortments of genes, produced by meiosis, to face the environment in new ways. But why TWO sexes? The answer is not culturally determined. The answer does not depend on sociology or (other forms of) fiction. It depends on the chemistry of DNA, which forms the double helix we all know and love, thereby making itself stronger and more resistant to random change during life. Let's represent a diploid strand as AA' in one individual, and BB' in a second. These separate into A - A' and B - B' at meiosis. When they combine, they can recombine as AB, A'B, AB', A'B': so where before there were 2 genotypes, there are now 4, and it may be that the new combinations are more advantageous for survival than the old. This is how evolution works. As long as DNA chemistry works this way, this is the way things have to be. Two strands, 2 individuals to contribute their shares. Nature is prolific and ingenious, so at higher levels of organization (and by higher I mean only higher in an organizational sense), all sorts of arrangements to bring this mechanism about are possible. Some of these arrrangements are more likely in physical, chemical, biological or environmental terms than others, and it seems that the two-sex arrangement has particularly high survival value, for it is omnipresent. Let's refer to these as supra-sexual arrangements. Among these survival arrangements is the universal presence of mitochondria in animal cells. Nitochondria are not a third sex. They are originally parasitic microorganisms that became symbiotic in animal cells, giving energy in exchange for protection and transport. This arrangment was obviously highly beneficial. Mitochondria carry their own genes. Eukaryotes produce motile sperm cells and sessile ova. Sperm cells are basically stripped-down packages containg a haploid genome, and little else. Ova contain the genome, in a fully-functioning cell, which contains mitochondria. When this cell is fertilized,, each time thereafter that cell division occurs, each new cell contains about half of the mitochondria of the parent cell, and these mitochondria then reproduce asexually within the cell. So in the adult organism, all the mitochondria are descendants of the originals in the ovum that gave rise to all those cells, which is why we can trace mitochondrial lineages through the mother, but not through the father. In the case of the queen ant cited above, she no doubt requires fertilization by two individuals to produce two types of offspring because these two individuals have slightly different genomes. This is a neat demonstration of a supra-sexual arrangement. Another such supra-sexual arrangement might be the rich bachelor uncle who sets up his nephew in a house of his own so he can get married. This has high survival value, which is why it is common in all human groups. In English we call this nepotism. 

Nope. As others have commented, two objects large enough to have significant gravity will either destroy each other or become one large blob (in a cataclysmic event) when they get anywhere near each other. If the objects are small, like 2 asteroids, they won't tear each other apart. However, asteroids don't have atmosphere, which makes life impossible (as far as we know). Also, the meager gravity would give your creatures the tendency to float off into space and die if they didn't hold on all the time. 

I agree with Rory's answer, particularly about the exaggerated variations at sunrise and sunset. I just want to add that if both suns set or rise at the same time, you won't see those variations. Both suns will set/rise at the same time daily only if the planet is orbiting close to 90 degrees off of the plane of the ecliptic, or the binary stars are orbiting each other 90 degrees off the plane of the ecliptic. For a normal planet orbiting within the plane of the ecliptic, this will sort of happen at the poles: the suns will appear to drop below the horizon at the same time with the passage of seasons. 

Everyone would panic and argue and go nuts, definitely. However, I think a great wish would go as follows: 

Everything would reach the speed of light, simultaneously growing to infinite mass, and therefore infinite gravity, causing all matter to collapse into a single ginormous black hole. (The force of gravity would overtake the new acceleration you propose.) 

I just finished watching a season of Battlebots on TV last night, so I think you could use the same approach. Each robot would have a different design (within parameters set by the league), and a different set of engineers & programmers making it work. The humans would build the rapport with the fans through interviews, press conferences, signings, etc, but the robot athletes would be the ones on the merchandise and the ones that the fans are cheering for at games.
