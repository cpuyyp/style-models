It really depends on the person -- some people love personal interaction and initiate greetings, and others would just as soon go about their business. Think of this from the receptionist's point of view -- if you had to say hello several hundred times a day, would you think that was fun? In a smaller office it might seem rude, but I think you are correct in this case to let the person's response dictate your actions. 

As others have said, I would not bring this idea up at all -- rather challenge yourself to do good work and advance. You may surprise yourself in your ability to excel if given the opportunity. Asking for a demotion only increases the perception that you don't have what it takes to move to the next level. Eventually (if your plan succeeds) you will get back to where you are now, so your request is in a way self-defeating. You can't really say for sure that getting demoted decreases your chance of being fired. However, if you are determined to ask for demotion, I would do so gradually and unofficially at first. Ask others, as outside your immediate focus area as possible, if this has ever been done. Work your way toward the point where you can confidently make your request knowing what the answer will be. 

In my experience, people who queue up for a bus have priority over those who don't. You trade comfort (having to stand up next to a road or sign for X minutes) for privilege (the ability to get on the bus earlier). In some cases, where there's plenty of room on the bus, it doesn't matter whether you queue up or not -- everyone gets on. 

If your reference has a question, it's not unethical for you to ask for clarification and provide guidance. Many times references will ask for a personal statement or draft letter in your own words to help them answer. At the same time, it's important for you to encourage your reference to answer only those questions that are relevant and make sense in the context of your relationship. For anything else, "I was not in a position to observe" is a fine response. 

Unless you've been fired, or are casting your departure in a negative way (e.g., blaming other people), the truth is that your future employer places less weight in an interview on why you are leaving, and it's best not to dwell on the details. Best to say you are looking for a new opportunity because you do not feel professionally satisfied, or adequately challenged in your old/current job. Avoid being negative, especially in regard to previous employers or co-workers. Focus on the future and what you can bring to the new company. 

Although people are generally more educated and understanding today regarding mental health issues, I would not discuss specifics. Simply say you had health issues that prevented you from working for a certain period of time. I can't imagine anyone would jump to the conclusion that you were in rehab or something similar, and I would be surprised if an interviewer were to push the issue beyond your initial, simple explanation. The fact that you have a long history of exceptional performance is going to be more important to your potential employer, as is your reassurance and references to show you are now capable of doing the work, and doing it well. A confident interview will help reinforce your message that you are ready to get back to work, and contribute to your new employer. 

The rule of thumb for conversion from a full-time salaried position with benefits to an hourly rate as a contractor or freelancer is 

In terms of career growth, the actual title is less important than the responsibilities of the new position, so I would worry less about item #2, to the point of not even asking. Unless you are looking to quit in the next 6 months, your entering title doesn't even matter, and might suggest you're planning to job-hop without proving yourself. Think of the even longer term. You may be thinking that right now is a step backward, but if this is a much bigger company with larger projects, you now have a path upward, a chance to get into a lead/mentor role on larger projects. Consider the fact that you're coming in as "only" a developer as an advantage: you have the opportunity to observe for a while and see how things are done in the new place -- might be much different than in your current position. Seems to me this is a natural progression, from a senior/lead role in a smaller company to a developer in a larger company. You're looking to learn and grow for the right reasons. Even if you don't get to the management position you want, you will have gathered valuable experience to go back to a management position at a medium-sized company. Sounds like you would have plenty of room to move up in the new job, which is always a very important consideration. 

Although you might be justified in waiting to be tasked, ultimately your manager is more interested in your starting work, no matter how that happens. Be proactive -- reach out to your contact immediately, either by email (and copy your manager), phone, or in person, whichever is more immediate and effective. If you are not able to charge time until you have tasks, all the more reason to act quickly and decisively. Escalate the issue to your manager, or anyone else who might be able to help, if you do not receive responses, since your contact is already late in getting back to you. Keep your manager in the loop throughout the process, documenting your attempts to get started working on your tasks. 

I got a team, and i am new to the company. Sometimes they are in discussion of something that i am not aware of many things they talk, i feel awkward as all developer are brainstorming and i always have some work, even if i give my advice. I am not "really" able to help them expect give them pointers. However when i need help, they really help me out like a pro. How can i overcome this lack/guilt that i am not much capable of helping them as they are to me. Does this have negative impact on my probation and job? 

I haven't had performance review in my career and it might seem odd but I feel danger, my manager is based in another city and we are in another. He is coming for our meeting. I know I had issues and i might get laid off today but do I get a chance to talk of why I am so slow or why I had trouble communicating or I do that in a appeal (If I am allowed to appeal the decision)? 

I have never given a noticed period so I am not sure how it is going to be, but my question are post notice period.Am I obliged to give an answer to the question if my manager asks things like what company you are going to or what package they are offering you, so we might know and offer you same? Am I obliged to answer those as notice period I am still under the contract and I to sound rude in other words burn all the bridges. 

It helps them filter good from bad, and I don't think anyone gives a really big test that is time-consuming unless you don't know it, if someone is good at something, they should welcome it and it is a plus that you can add it to your repo, and your knowledge even if you get hired or not. 

Declining means, either you have an attitude or not a team player or too committed to give new company times, all which IMO are red flags. 

I am a Front end developer. I am sometimes assigned task that i do before time, therefore i ask my manager to check it. Is it a good idea to ask your Reporting Manager or Project Manager to have a look, making him jump off his seat to come and look at the work or it is better to do it and keep it aside while i do something that is good for me i.e study online or watch tutorial. In both cases i just don't want to sound bad, because when i call my manager to have a look, it remind me of time of school, when you use to call you teacher to ask you have done your work first. :P 

Sometimes it happens that being a part of team, my manager won't understand why it cannot be the way something was example. I am working on a very very bad code clean up and making changes for a website to make it responsive, but the code is so badly done that when i do a semantic coding for standardizing as per html validator would pass. It breaks a lot of things. I am unable to convey my message across as a team member would want to know what is wrong with code, and his reply is "it doesn't matter", where as being hired as a expert i know it does. So all drill down to my manager asking why isn't it way it was e.g formatting, alignment, as he is committed to bank end. I want to know how can i convey my message across, without offending or making my manager think i am unable or running away and in future, code should be good for me to work on. 

Sometimes it seem that my day just go by and i am unable to justify myself, where i spend and doing what. I am in a new role, where i am waiting for a external company to provide design and i can start working on it, meanwhile i explore and do what is told to me but again i want to audit my time and how i spend it, what i learned because if a manager asks me and I can tell.Sometimes i stray to other websites such as news or amazon but how can i manage and audit my time, especially when i got nothing to work on? 

I have performance review and it is within my probation period. While I never had one before and generally I find many question regarding performance review after a 1 year in a job. I am curious to know what goes in the meeting and what are the the do and don'ts of discussing it in meeting despite your review going bad, good or worse. (Although I had been lagging behind my task) 

I am just one month into a 6 months probation, where my work is very tough as I am trying to catch up on a matured project with little to no help on how and where to, all I get is "look at other examples". It has send me into a worry state which is affecting my health every now and then. Does sick day on probation affect the outcome? Given one is trying to cope up, take extra time to finish a task because he/she are new to project and help is limited. I have 1-1 with manager, he might bring all these things up. Can taking sick leave be a reason for my termination? Although my manager says in email "to take good care"
