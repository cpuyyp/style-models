The whole thing of asking your previous salary as part of the negotiation is pretty rubbish and I know that one US state (Massachusetts) has actually brought in a law to ban employers from asking for it. There are some tactics for declining to provide the information but they aren't going to help you here as you've already disclosed the figure and refusing to provide the payslip will probably just make them assume the worst. There's nothing wrong with accounting for the bonus when asked for your pay - after all it formed part of your overall compensation package. As for how to handle the discrepancy in amounts - if you have any documentation to substantiate the bonus amount, or even just the existence of the bonus itself then I would supply it along with the payslip. If you don't then when you hand over the payslip (or email it in or whatever) just provide a matter of fact explanation like: 

I've had co-workers like this, as have many people I'd imagine and it's not easy to deal with. The problem is not that they forget things, most people do that. The problem is that they take anything that highlights something they had forgotten about as critiscm or even a personal slight, especially if they are sensitive about their memory for whatever reason. It's probably not the answer you're hoping for but I've never found a silver bullet that works for it. The best I've found so far is to use e-mail as an audit trail as @Erik suggested in his comment (the holy grail of this setup is when you can get them to reply and confirm to the e-mail but that's not always possible and is out of your control). Firstly (and most importantly) this covers you from anything coming back to bite you later. You really don't want to have one of these incidents go seriously sideways on you and have nothing but a "he-said, she said" to protect you. Secondly it can give you a way to de-escalate the situation - when the first thing some people with this tendency hear from someone is essentially "you're wrong" they immediately go to a mindset that they are being attacked and therefore percieve everything subsequent on the subject from that standpoint and reasonableness can go straight out of the window. To use this situation as an example (obviously without a time machine it's not going to help you here) when they queried why the profiles were going out sans-sitckers you can say: 

Certainly where I am (UK) this wouldn't be an unusual request and there wouldn't be a problem with it ethically or legally unless there were specific mentions of confidentiality on the quote (and that would be exceptionally rare - especially in a B2C context) 

If you still harbor a desire to work for this company (just not doing what they currently have you doing) then the first place to start would be to have a frank conversation with your manager about your expectations for what the job would entail and ask whether there is any plan/opportunity to adjust your role to be closer to that. If they say that the current situation is only temporary then you'll want to push them to give you timescales (anything billed as temporary without them tends to be much closer to "permanent" in my experience with these things) and then it's up to you to determine whether you find what they are saying credible enough to stick it out. If they don't offer you a satisfactory plan for transitioning the role into something you would be happy with then, well, you have your answer. At that point you can politely say that you don't see it working out and that you think it would be better for everyone if you returned to your old job. As for longer term consequences - if you can't come to an agreement on what the job should be then it's unlikely to make you enemies or have any real impact on your future employment prospects in the industry as a whole. Sometimes these things just don't work out. It only becomes a problem for your reputation or employability if a pattern develops. As for whether it will affect your future chances at this company - that's harder to answer as it will depend on how well they take it and also whether there is some sort of blanket "never re-hire anyone" policy that would apply (as stupid as it sounds some companies do have those!) but you have to think and decide that if they aren't going to give you a job you want, even after they have already hired you then do you really want to work there anyway? 

In general terms I would say yes it's acceptable, what I would potentially do though is before you open up the packet/tub/whatever of nuts is ask the people in your immediate vicinity if any of them have a severe allergy if you want to err on the safe side. 

It's a risky strategy - very risky. Since it still basically amounts to a polite ultimatum that if they don't sort themselves out and get you doing the job you signed on for that you will look to leave. This exposes you to the risk that they will choose to let you go instead but if you are in the position where you'd rather risk being unemployed rather than continue on in the role with unwanted duties then it might be worth doing. After all if they choose to let you go instead that speaks volumes about their sincerity in their promises then do you want to be there anyway? But obviously you may not be in a position where you can afford to be without work while you job hunt - and of course finding a new job is always easier when you already have one. Personally I probably wouldn't take that road - and instead I would push firmly for something in writing regarding timescales for them getting you working on your intended duties. And if the worst comes to the worst and they won't do that or fail to live up to it then I'd start job hunting with the 8 weeks notice and try to reduce that as much as possible in the event that I got another offer. But then I'm quite risk averse! 

If you don't have other 1-1 chats coming up with your manager (and the appraisal is relatively soon) then it makes sense - in most companies an annual appraisal should be a two-way process and it's a valid place to bring up any questions or concerns you have about the duties of the role going forward. I would try and make it about the future rather than the past as in my opinion it will come across better. That said however (and I appreciate this wasn't the main thrust of your question) I do wonder if you're overthinking this. Many jobs require you to perform a non-trivial amount of admin that is distinct from the actual "production" part of the job and because they are fairly mundane I wouldn't expect them to be explicitly discussed at an interview or in a job description. You seem to be taking the assignment of this task as some kind of unspoken critiscim of your performance but I'm not getting that read - admin tasks certainly aren't glamorous but that doesn't mean they don't need doing and 

Assuming you are still on good terms with them I would discuss this with your soon-to-be-ex employer and see what they think. After all they are going to be the ones to deal with any potential fallout should the successful candidate be disgruntled if you leave before/soon after they start. 

I think saying something is a good idea but how you say it is going to be just as important as what you say. As you wrote in your question you don't want to bash your team (which is excellent) and I'm sure you won't go in and just say "the app sucks, look at my version which is awesome and I knocked it up in a couple of weeks" but you really want to avoid taking any approach that could be interpreted as saying that. You need to bear in mind that there a couple of big potential factors and challenges that could have contributed to the existing app taking as long as it has to develop and functioning and looking the way that it does, many of which you will not have faced in your re-write: 

Yes absolutely let them know, if you have someone who is in charge of office or kitchen supplies then they are the best person to speak to. Otherwise I'd talk to your manager about it, explain what happened, apologize and say that you won't be doing so again and offer to purchase a replacement. 

Cutting your direct manager out of the loop on something like this (unless you have been explicitly requested to do so by someone senior to them) or even giving the impression that is what you are doing is generally a really bad idea. If I've interpreted this wrong and your direct manager is the only recipient at this stage, in which case it's not really a big deal either way. 

Actually reads to me that this task needs doing and you are the person they trust to get it done and to get it done right. Which actually suggests that they think highly of you! If the admin tasks are causing you to struggle to meet deadlines or milestones on your other tasks then discuss this with your manager in the same way you would the balancing of any other competing tasks - if you can't determine which task is a higher priority yourself then ask your manager (or whomever assigns your tasks) which they would prefer you to prioritize and make any knock-on effects to deadlines clear. 

I fully sympathize with this (speaking as someone who lives in a locale that has negligible tech jobs) but there's not much for it other than to deal with the long commutes or move. In your case it sounds like perhaps getting a car might be an avenue worth pursing as this will vastly open up the places you can get to and therefore jobs you can apply for. 

No. I don't mean to sound callous but you have to look out for yourself first - a level of loyalty to an employer is good and can help you in your career as well but there have to be limits and I think this is one of them. You were suitably generous with your notice period and I think once the initial irritation at having to re-arrange things for the client has passed they will understand that it's nothing personal.
