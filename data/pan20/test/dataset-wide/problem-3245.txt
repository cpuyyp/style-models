Who advocated for a strong push in North Africa, listing the following positive sides of such a campaign: 

The Papacy is as good as it gets as an example - altough there were families with considerable influence over the choice of Cardinals and later on the Pope, and Nepotism was rampant, there were effective checks on Papal power - if one family tried to get a firm grip on the Pope/Papal position, at least one unhappy nation would start a war, not to mention the internal plots that would try to curb said family's power. A perfect example are the Borgias - synonymous with "nepotism", "greed for power" and etc. they had only two Popes, and especially the second one, Alexander VI, who had a lot of power and tried to advance his family in all possible ways - he nearly brought the destruction of his House because there were a lot of people, Kings and Emperors and Cardinals and regular bishops and schemeres who misliked him and how powerful he and his relatives were. So, as we can see, there was a sort of self-regulating principle that curbed the power of whoever got too much of it. Edit: Plus, the mere fact that (by definition and job description) the Pope doesn't have any children, the "same family inheritance" is extremely limited (and that's why nepotism is named nephewism) 

The first set is a Japanese 10-yen banknote issued in 1946, during Allied occupation of Japan. The second set is a one peso banknote issued in 1943 in occupied Philippines by the Japanese government. The third set is a 1 shilling Oceanian Pound banknote issued in 1942, also by the Japanese government, and intended for use in various occupied British and Commonwealth territories in the Pacific. 

Note that he did not actually restore the jizya tax until 1679, and this was suspended after 1704. When the jizya tax was being collected, it was also earmarked for charity. It was apparently an unemployment relief project designed to bribe the clergy for political reasons. 

(Click for large version. Source: University of Tsukuba.) Much more accurate maps of Japan were available by the 17th century, when the Tokugawa Shogunate began a concerted effort to precisely chart Japan. For example, the artist Ishikawa Tomonobu created this map in 1691: 

Yes, he did, but this is taken out of context. He had nothing against heavy tanks per se, but in a specific case he was extremely unhappy to have to wait several months, giving the enemy plenty of time to prepare its defenses, to receive a handful of Panzer Vs(instead of attacking directly), as Hitler insisted. And on that specific case, he was completely right - the Battle of Kursk was a disaster for the Germans, since the Soviets under Zhukov had multiple months to prepare one of the deepest defences in depth(up to 200km, if memory serves me right), and for the whole Steppe Front(again, if memory serves me right, a ~400,000 army, brought from the Far East, and Zhukov's last stategic reserve) to arrive. Both of these prevented Manstein from achieving victory(just as he was starting to overcome the biggest portion of the defenses the Steppe Front hit him, and hit him hard; and besides, the operation was supposed to be a two-prolonged assault to encircle the Kursk bulge, and only the Southern attack, Manstein's, succeeded, the Northern part was stopped much earlier) and he was furious - if only the hadn't waited months to strike... Furthermore, the German heavy tanks were beasts of engineering and as a consequence they were a heavy burden to maintain and supply. (If I am not mistaken) even Guderian was against throwing huge ressources into small amounts of heavy tanks that were costly to use, he favoured the Soviet style, "quantity has a quality of its own". Except with German quality. 

A less righteous read of the refusal is that the Serbian government feared Austria would discover that Serbia knew about the assassination. Alternatively, Serbian leaders might (perhaps reasonably) simply fear that given the authority, the Austrians would simply frame them. 

The question is a bit confusing. The way I read it, you're asking why something expensive has enough demand to sustain a profitable trade ("How did the high price of spices allow such high demand?"). The answer is that it wasn't that expensive. A pound of spices might cost several days' worth of wages for an average craftsman, but a pound of pepper is a lot of pepper. It was a luxury item, to be sure, but it wasn't completely out of reach for the average middle class professional. Furthermore, that is not at all a prohibitive sum for the wealthy, which includes the ranks of not only the aristocracy, but also the growing class of merchants and higher level professionals and other large land owners. And no, Western Europe was not "mostly serfs" during this period. The claim that spices were worth their weight in gold (quite an exaggeration to tell the truth, for all but saffron) also shows why the spices had a market. Gold and silver were expensive, and yet there was clearly a market for it. The Spanish shipped in shiploads of it from the New World, for instance. Spices, which were cheaper and yet consumables, would logically have a bigger market as long as Europeans have a demand for them as luxury goods. Of course, highly priced luxury items by their nature are not traded in high volumes. Neither was spices: the supply, in Europe, was severely limited. Much later when the VOC gained its spice trade monopoly, the Dutch began shipping around 270 tons of cinnamon per year, which was at the time a vast quantity that outstripped local supplies. Contrast that with modern cinnamon production of ~35,000 tons. And as more and more trade routes were established and transplanted spices started to be growing in more places, supply enlarged and the value of spices fell. Note that limited supplies in the late Medieval period didn't affect the profitability of the spice trade. The spice trade was "such a profitable venture" precisely because "spices are quite expensive when they reach their terminal buyer" - relative to their cost in Asia, which is something like 1/10 or 1/100 the sales price. And again, as supplies expanded, prices fell. EDIT: As luxury goods, The main consumers of spice were the wealthy, middle to upper class members of society. Religious and supposed medicinal uses aside, these people valued spices because it is expensive; it formed a social status symbol, desirable for showing off. The marriage of Duke Georg of Bavaria to Polish Princess Hedwigis was celebrated with a feast involving almost 1300 pounds of various spices, for example. While the rich could afford the a wide variety of expensive spices in ridiculous amounts (i.e., Duke Georg), it wasn't beyond the means of the common folk either. As noted above, a pound of pepper might cost a craftsman several days work - enough to make it a luxury goods, but not so expensive that it was affordable. So even (well to-do) peasants could afford pepper, the cheapest of the common spices. 

The reunification of Germany in 1990 was effected by a treaty between the governments of East and West Germany (the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, respectively). The treaty was voted on separately by the respective legislatures, and passed with large majorities of 299–80 in the GDR and 440–47 in the FRG. I'm interested in learning more about who voted against the reunification treaty and why. The German Wikipedia mentions that the "no" votes came from members of the Party of Democratic Socialism (the successor to the Socialist Unity Party that had ruled the GDR since 1949) and Alliance 90/The Greens in the GDR, and members of The Greens and the Union parties (the CDU and CSU) in the FRG. From what I can tell, the PDS had largely renounced Leninism and expelled most of its Leninist-era leaders. On what basis, then, did they campaign for keeping East Germany as a separate state? (Or were they in fact in favour of reunification, but not on the specific terms given in the treaty? If so, what terms in particular did they find objectionable?) The reunification treaty was also voted against by The Greens in both East and West Germany. Was this an official policy of both Green parties, or was it only a faction who voted this way? Regardless, what was their stated motivation? Finally, in the FRG, the CDU/CSU alliance held 255 seats at the time of the treaty vote, so it seems only a small minority of them voted "no". Who were these members? Did they act in concert, as a faction? What reasons did they give for voting against reunification? 

Because he wasn't a good strategic thinker and was more of an impulsive, borderline crazy, person(i even read a theory that associated his different behaviours with the use of different drugs, and frankly, it even made a little sense). In Nazi Germany, most decisions were taken by Hitler, based on his own perceptions of reality and facts, and he rarely listened to his advisors or generals(unless they could appeal to his maniacal/ideological/political/personal side and influence it, like Goring did), regardless of their experience and prowess. He dismissed generals on a whim because they failed in a battle where a more observant person would see they made a briliant defence. There were multiple renowned, experienced people, like: 

And the funny thing is, Rommel, with his measely 2 divisions and the almost good-for-nothing Italians, was pretty close to defeating the British in Egypt. Just imagine what could have happened had he had the firepower and ressources he wanted. Basically, any logical mind would say that it's worth it, but Hitler isn't known to be very logical. Yes, he was extremely intelligent, had good people skills and etc. but he did make a plethora of bad geopolitical and strategic decisions. Logistics were going to be difficult for such a theatre, but they were going to be easier to manage than those in the North African desert on its own(with Suez and Alexandria under German control, the only western British bases were Cyprus and Malta, much easier to subdue), due to a lesser British presence and shorter shipping lanes(Taranto->Tobruk is longer and closer to a British base[Malta] than Pirea->Haifa or Varna->Trabzon). Edited as per the comments to better link the two parts of the response and add more detail. 

At the first Nuremberg trial, twenty-one defendants were tried in person: Karl Dönitz, Hans Frank, Wilhelm Frick, Hans Fritzsche, Walther Funk, Hermann Göring, Rudolf Hess, Alfred Jodl, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Wilhelm Keitel, Konstantin von Neurath, Franz von Papen, Erich Raeder, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alfred Rosenberg, Fritz Sauckel, Hjalmar Schacht, Baldur von Schirach, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Albert Speer, and Julius Streicher. The official trial languages were English, German, French, and Russian. The participants (including the German-speaking defendants) were provided with headphones for simultaneous translation. However, in many photographs of the proceedings, not all of the defendants are wearing headphones. While it may be the case that these defendants simply weren't paying attention, or that they had removed their headphones during a lull in the proceedings, it may also be the case that they already had a sufficient command of the foreign language(s) being spoken. Which of the Nuremberg defendants could already speak English, French, or Russian at the time of the trial? And of those who survived the trial, did any of them later learn English, French, or Russian? I know only part of the answer already: there are video recordings of Karl Dönitz speaking English, and Albert Speer speaking French and English. However, these were made long after the war, so I don't know whether they understood these languages during their trial. 

Another view is that modernisation is a relative concept. That is, the idea of Meiji Japan modernising only exists because she was surpassed by the West and wanted to eliminate the gap. In this view, modernity is not about the economy per se, but rather about adopting the necessary institutions to keep up from now on. Black's definition is in this vein, tying modernity to the ability to partake in the scientific revolution: 

Additionally, Peter forbade women from taking the veil before the age of 50. This prevented fertile women from wasting their reproductive potential; but it also meant that husbands could no longer dispose of inconvenient wives by forcing them to enter monasteries (as Peter himself had done). 

Practicalities After independence, the Union of India wanted to maintain the Himalayan frontier policy of British India against an ascendant Communist China. Bhutan and Nepal (and Sikkim) were strategic buffer states for this purpose. For their part, the Himalayan kingdoms chose to maintain and strengthen their link to India while manoeuvring to maintain their independence. Bhutan reoconised Indian suzerainity in a 1949 treaty, in which it agreed to be "guided" by gave India in foreign affairs. Nepal also signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1950. These measures more or less eliminated any immediate need by India to fully annex the two kingdoms. Rather than potentially upset the regional balance of power, as well as risk additional internal destabilisation with unnecessary annexations (especially given Bhutan's Buddhist population), the statue quo pre-independence was maintained. To a certain degree this outcome might be attributed to India's good will, but pre-existing legal conditions and strategic considerations were important factors. 

A personal union occurs when two otherwise independent states (each with their own territories, governments, etc.) come to share the same monarch. Has it ever come to pass that two member states of a personal union fought a war with each other? Note that I mean to exclude civil wars and rebellions; I am interested in those cases where the legitimate, recognized government of a country prosecutes a war against the legitimate, recognized government of another country, and both governments recognize the same monarch as head of state. 

After World War II, tens of millions of ethnic Germans from Central and Eastern Europe were forcibly expelled into Allied-occupied Germany and Austria. What happened to all the homes they left behind? That is, to whom was ownership transferred—were the expelees given the opportunity to sell their real estate on the private market, or were they obliged to transfer ownership to the newly installed or restored governments, or was the property simply abandoned with no legal formalities? If the properties were typically nationalized or abandoned, then how were homes reallocated? Did the governments systematically survey the evacuated properties and try to match them up with locally displaced citizens, or was the process more haphazard? Were there any less war-torn countries that ended up with a housing surplus? 

Richard Meinertzhagen is known to be a serious liar. Refer to his Wikipedia article: for example, he stole numerous biological samples and presented them as his own in Europe. That said, the Meinertzhagens were a wealthy family and there's no reason to presume the army salary was Richard's sole source of income. According to The Meinertzhagen Mystery by Brian Garfield, before his retirement in 1925 as a major, Meinertzhagen's salary was about £900 yearly. The Bank of England inflation calculator says it is equivalent to £52,016 in 2017. Coincidentally, that's almost identical to the second lowest step of the current British army pay for a Major, £52,078. 

Likewise, Major North Ludlow Beamish, who served in the Dragoon Guards, noted in his translation of a Württemberg cavalry general's military treatise that: 

Note 1 There was no particular reason for the military governors of Japan to be styled Shogun. A sufficiently powerful and determined samurai lord can impress the Imperial Court into appointing himself Shogun (most popular), or (which Toyotomi Hideyoshi chose), or (like the Fujiwaras), or (as Taira no Kiyomori achieved), or really anything they could think of or make up.
