GDP is not itself a measure of welfare, though in some circumstances changes in GDP correlate fairly well with changes in measures of welfare (see for example Coyle D GDP: A Brief but Affectionate History pp 113-122). So it's a fallacy to argue that if the increases in exports and imports do not change GDP they cannot be good or bad. If, for example, the initial position was one of autarky, and if the exports are of a good in which the country has a comparative advantage and the imports are of a good in which it has a comparative disadvantage, then welfare can be raised (as indicated for example by higher consumption from the same domestic inputs). As a secondary point, especially for a small country which must accept world prices for goods it exports or imports, trade will result in changes in at least some domestic prices. That in turn means that it may not even be true that GDP would not change, since some of the prices used in the value added calculations to measure GDP (from the output perspective) will have changed. 

While such institutions are largely taken for granted in developed countries, North suggests that their growth is not an inevitable development, and indeed that the historical norm is the absence of such a development (p 98 of Institutions).

The first / second seller terminology can be confusing here (does it relate to time or to conditionality?). It's safer to focus on a particular seller. Let the probability that a buyer finds a particular seller, $s$, via single search be $\nu_s$. The probability that a buyer is matched with $s$ and (either before or after) another seller is then (assuming that $\nu_s$ is small so that the probability of finding $s$ twice in at most 2 searches can be ignored): $$\psi_u(\nu_s\nu+\nu\nu_s)= 2\psi_u\nu_s\nu$$ The probability that a buyer is matched with $s$ via either a single or a double search is (again ignoring the probability, given a double search, of finding $s$ twice): $$(1-\psi_u)\nu_s + \psi_u(\nu_s + \nu_s)=\nu_s(1+\psi_u)$$ The conditional probability of a buyer being matched with $s$ and another seller, conditional on $s$ being matched with that buyer, is therefore: $$\frac{2\psi_u\nu_s\nu}{\nu_s(1+\psi_u)}=\frac{2\psi_u\nu}{1+\psi_u}$$ But the latter formula does not depend on $\nu_s$. Hence the same formula applies to any seller. 

In an essay entitled Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, Keynes famously argued that people would one day only need to work 15 hours per week (see bottom of p 4). This was linked to an argument about satiation (see p 3, half way down), although he was careful to say that this applies to absolute needs, and that relative needs (ie needs to feel superior to others) may be insatiable. 

These are both valid ways of describing the situation: which is more useful would depend on what you are trying to do. One caveat. Although production functions often suggest otherwise, labour is not homogeneous. Even if only a few people are killed, the effect on production could be significant if those people happen to have key skills that are in short supply, or knowledge the loss of which would affect the technological level. 

In the UK, a builder constructing a new home need not add tax to the price charged, but a builder undertaking repairs or renovations to an existing home must add value added tax (VAT, currently 20%). (There are some exceptions but that's the general rule - details can be found in HMRC Notice 708). Question: Are there any economic reasons that could justify a higher tax rate on repairs and renovations than on new construction? I am interested in general economic arguments, whether applicable to the UK or not. A possible argument for not taxing construction of new homes (even if most goods and services are subject to VAT) is that VAT should be regarded as a tax on consumption, and should instead be charged on the consumption of housing services (Barker K (2014) Housing: Where's the Plan? p 64). That presumably means that, for owner-occupiers, the tax authorities should determine the value of the housing services they consume each year and charge VAT on that. However, even this argument does not seem to justify the differential taxation of new construction, since the same argument could be applied to renovations and repairs, implying that what is taxed should be any resulting increase in the value of housing services. Addendum 14/9/2017: I've slightly changed the wording so that it invites answers on either side, either yes there are reasons or no there are not. 

The answer to this question will depend on circumstances, and so it is entirely proper here to raise further questions including how the $100 million is funded and how it will be used. It's a reasonable assumption that the propensity to spend of benefit recipients will be high. If the funding were from increased taxation of people on middle and high incomes who have a somewhat lower propensity to spend, then the net effect would be an increase in aggregate demand, perhaps with a multiplier effect, so GDP would probably increase. (I say 'perhaps' and 'probably' because there could be further complications, eg spending on imports.) If the funding were via government borrowing, then there would potentially be direct effects on both demand and interest rates, and it would be quite challenging (and need further information) to identify all the indirect effects including the effect on GDP. 

In his 1977 article (from which has developed a considerable literature on the Hartwick Rule for maintaining long-term constant consumption given depletion of non-renewable natural resources), Hartwick uses (on p 973) this aggregate production function: $$x = k^{\alpha}y^{\beta}1^{\gamma}$$ Here (see p 972) $x$ is per capita output, $k$ is per capita reproducible capital, and $y$ is per capita use of an exhaustible resource. $1$ is just the number one, labour being assumed constant (so the term $1^{\gamma}$ seems redudant). So in more familiar notation (output $Y$, capital $K$, use of exhaustible resource $R$, labour $L$), and glossing over the difference between population and labour, this is: $$\frac{Y}{L}=\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^{\beta}$$ Hartwick then assumes (p 972) constant returns to scale in the form (explicitly on p 973) $\alpha+\beta=1$. Question: What reasons might justify the assumption of constant returns in the above form? Isn't it more plausible to assume constant returns when all factors are increased, that is to assume $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=1$ in a production function of the form: $$Y=K^{\alpha}R^{\beta}L^{\gamma}$$ This does imply the above function since: $$\frac{Y}{L} = \frac{K^{\alpha}R^{\beta}L^{\gamma}}{L^{\alpha}L^{\beta}L^{\gamma}}=\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^{\beta}$$ However, given $\gamma>0$, it is inconsistent with $\alpha+\beta=1$: instead $\alpha+\beta<1$. 

Focusing on a partial production function in terms of $L$ only (that is, treating $A$ and $K_i$ as fixed parameters in the short term), there has been a change from $Y=AK_0^{\alpha}L^{\beta}$ to $Y=AK_1^{\alpha}L^{\beta}$. With $K_1<K_0$, that implies a shift downwards, with labour productivity having decreased. However, the full production function in terms of $K$ and $L$ is unchanged, and there has been a movement on the surface defined by the function. If the function were plotted in three dimensions, with $K$ and $L$ on horizontal axes and $Y$ vertical, then this would be a movement downward (and along the $K$ dimension).
