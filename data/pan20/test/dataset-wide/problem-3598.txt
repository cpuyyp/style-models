I am feeling pretty battered and reckon I really need to take a week off from lifting weights. What are some things I should take into consideration? Should I adjust my diet? Eat less? Eat less protein? More vegetables? Is doing some light cardio going to get in the way? 

There are plenty of body weight exercises that could keep you going. If you find pushups too easy (ie. you can do more than 5 easily) make it harder by doing inclined pushups, or try one armed pushups. If squats are too hard - can you do one-legged squats (pistols)? A good book to work through during the week would be The Naked Warrior. Pavel goes in intricate detail about mastering the one armed pushup and the pistol. What you learn from going through this book will be useful for your Starting Strength program. Also, pullups and chinups will give you a good upper body workout - if they are too easy, try them one-handed. 

It seems a lot of form problems with the squats are caused by inadequate flexibility - I think mainly in the hamstrings and also the shoulders. What are some good stretches that can be used to enhance the squat form? 

I hear this term quite a lot - "if you exercise it will boost your metabolism". The implication generally being that if you do some exercise not only will the exercise burn some calories, but you will also continue to burn more calories throughout the day. This doesn't make much sense to me. We store calories so that we have some reserves to draw on when needed. If we burn a load of calories, the body wouldn't just think "oh ok, I'll just off load some more for the hell of it". I'm sure it would be the opposite, it would see you exerting yourself and think it would need to hold on to the calories to be used when you exert yourself again. So, what does boosting your metabolism actually mean? 

I have recently started doing the overhead press as per Starting Strength. I am getting a pain when I get close to the full extension of the press. It feels like a tendon pain as it is in a very small area at the top of the shoulder joint. The pain only occurs if I press more than about 30kg or so. What could be causing that pain? Or if its not that easy to tell over the internet what is causing the pain, what steps should I go through to try to locate and fix the cause? 

Eating anything will help you lose weight if you don't eat much of it. If you were to eat nothing but that cereal, given the most conservative estimate of 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day required to maintain muscle - a 150lb human would require 75 grams of protein. To get that from the cereal you would need to eat 892 grams of the cereal - almost 2 1/2 packets. This would also give you 700 grams of carbohydrates, 153 grams of sugar and 3321 calories. This is what is required for a sedentary person - an active person would need more protein so would have to eat more. You would get fat. 

If you are going over technique with a coach the sooner you try out what you have learnt, the more information will stick in your mind. So I would stick with the Friday work out. Don't try to get any personal bests with your weights - but still move up so it feels fairly heavy and focus on the technique you've learnt. Overtraining is something that occurs over a period of time. One day isn't going to wipe you out. 

I am currently working with 5 sets. As I get into higher weights and have to rest longer between sets, it is pushing on my lunch hour and the boss is starting to frown. So if there isn't much difference between 5 and 3, I'll drop down to 3 sets to keep the job.. 

Here is a list of sports and the average calories lost whilst taking part in them. Running, skiing, diving and cycling seem to lost the highest calories. However the best sport is probably one that you will do. The more you enjoy it, the more likely you will keep at it. Which ones do you enjoy the most? 

Supplements are not a solution. Once you have got everything else in order - diet / exercise / sleep, then supplements can be used to fine tune the process. That is all they can do. The supplements you have tried make you more tired. So stop using them. By the sounds of it you are leading a fairly stressful life. You have an inconsistent work schedule, you work out too much and you don't sleep enough (most people need at least 8 hours). This causes your body to produce Cortisol. Cortisol is produced by stress and is useful if you need to save your life in some emergency situation. However, what it does is it boosts your blood sugar levels and impairs your insulin sensitivity. This will make you fat and prevent your muscles from growing. It will also destroy your energy levels. To fix this, sleep more. You should be able to wake up each morning without the aid of an alarm clock. Work out less. Three times a week, for no more than an hour at a time is adequate. Some light cardio can take up the rest of the time if you need more... 

Generally when lifting weights if you do a low number of reps it will increase your strength, and a higher number of reps will increase your endurance. However when it comes to the number of sets to do, I'm a little more confused. 

If all you want to do is lose weight, all you really need is a weekly amphetamine binge. Your goals are the wrong way round. Concentrate on being healthy first. The weight loss will naturally occur. Weight loss generally doesn't occur in a straight line. It fluctuates. It is hard to stay focused on a goal that is all over the place. If you work on health, 20 kilos in a year should be achievable. Weight loss is achieved through a combination of two elements - diet and exercise. Diet Diet is by far the most important factor. First of all work out what you are putting in to yourself. For a week write down everything you ingest. How much of it is junk and how much is whole foods? By junk I mean processed - white bread, sugar, basically all the convenience foods. This voyage of discovery will help you become aware of the challenges that lie ahead. You want to cut out all the junk. Eat only whole foods. Here is more information. Booze won't help as that is largely empty calories. If you cut out completely though, you are less likely to succeed in your goal. Just be aware every time you drink of what you are doing to yourself and drink less. As you get healthier your natural desire to get wasted does reduce, so just leave it up to nature... Exercise Exercise (cardiovascular) for losing weight is overrated. You have to sit on a rowing machine for 20 minutes just to work off a pint of beer. Don't have any preconceptions that you can just run for 15 minutes a day to work off that massive pile of fast food you are about to eat. However, exercise for health and happiness is vital. The more you exercise the better you feel about yourself and the more likely you are to stick to a whole food diet. Your first goal will be to just get yourself moving. I would recommend a Couch to 5K program. This will get you running 5 kilometres in 9 weeks. Once you are a fair way into the running program and are less sedentary you are ready to turn to the iron. Unfortunately you set the bet to lose weight rather than just body fat. The best exercise for losing body fat is weight lifting. As you build up muscle your body needs more energy to maintain itself and burns off yer fat. Unfortunately as you build up muscle you get heavier. However, it is still well worth doing. You will just have to lose more fat than you gain muscle. As a beginner this is certainly doable - advanced bodybuilders struggle here. If you can join a gym, I recommend looking into the Strong Lifts program. It is designed for beginners and won't take up much of your time. If you don't want to do this have a look at Convict Conditioning. It is a strength training program using minimal equipment taking you from beginner to advanced. Whatever you do, don't let anyone tell you to do loads of sit ups. They do not work. 

You are right, for increasing muscle mass, training at intensity that allows you to perform 8-12 reps per set is reasonable. But note that it's not the number of repetitions per set that make the muscles grow, but the intensity of each repetition. If you are able to do more than 8-12 reps per set with a certain weight, the intensity of that weight has decreased for you, and training with that weight will not have the same effects than before, even if you increase the number of sets. 

I would strongly recommend too get a pull up bar, some rings, or a suspension trainer. Maybe one of the latter two make sense for you, as they can also be used for many other exercises. If you don't want to buy anything, try to use a door for pull ups. I think in order to gain strength, 10 pound dumbbells are too light, you should definetly train with higher intensity (like 3 to 5 sets of 3 to 5 reps each for each exercise). But training intensities are another story... Of course you should keep doing pushing exercises as well to prevent unbalance. 

For a watch with these "standard features", there is no other workaround than the one you mentioned. See also this wikipedia article. 

In theory, you can. Stamina can be trained with any kind of muscles, as long as you are getting training is a very high volume (which implies a low intensity). Note that stamina consists of muscular endurance (which depends on the muscles that are trained), and cardiovascular endurance (which depends on the whole cardiovascular system) In practice though, most people probably won't develop as much stamina (in terms of muscular endurance) in their upper body as in their legs, because they simply get more volume in using their legs (unless they start walking on their hands all the time). That being said, if you want to improve cardiovascular endurance, you will probably get faster results with leg workouts, because your legs already have more muscular endurance which gives you the ability of higher volume training. 

Question: I feel this is a bit too much volume for one workout, I'm currently alternating between doing [1,2,4,5,7] and [1,3,4,6,7]. I wonder if this makes sense or if I rather should stick with one of them for a longer period of time (like 2 weeks or so) and then switch to the other one? Relevant details: I'm doing 2 mins rest between sets and 0-2 warm-up sets for each exercise, so one workout is about 1 hour. I'm doing that 3x/week. I also do some low intensity running (5km) 2x/week. I started training 7 months ago. Any other advice on my program is greatly appreciated! 

Muscle soreness is a symptom of small damages within your muscle fibres. For treatment, it may helps to increase blood flow in order to supply the damaged muscle fibers with nutrients. Blood flow can be increased by 

Recently I stumbled upon the 4minute pushups test, which challenges you to do as many pushups as you can within 4 minutes (you can pause anytime as long as the clock keeps running). I'm wondering what would be the best strategy for doing this (maximizing the number of pushups). One strategy would be to go do consecutive pushups until failure, rest for some time, then do some more. Another strategy would be to evenly distribute the pushups. For instance, if plan to achieve 100 pushups, then I could do 4x(25 within 1min), or 10x(10 within 24seconds), or 100x(1 within 3.6seconds). EDIT: To clarify my question: I'm interested in the optimal distribution of breaks and work within the 4mins in order to maximize the achieveable number of pushups. I think this question can be generalized to: Given a time range, how do I distribute work and breaks over time in order to maximize the total volume? For instance, I've read somewhere that long distance runners try to run the first half of a race within 51% of their target time, which means that they run with almost constant intensity. If this applies to the pushup challenge, we should do half of the pushups in half of the time. Applying the same reasoning again, we should do 25% of the pushups in 25% of the time, and so on. Eventually this would lead to pausing after each pushup (because then the pushups are perfectly distributed over time). Of course, another strategy would be the one suggested by Moses in his answer (starting with a high number of consecutive pushups and a long rest, than a smaller number and a shorter rest, and so on). I'm wondering if there is one strategy that is known to be superior to others. 

Deadlifts (2 work sets of 4 reps) Press (3 work sets of 5) Ring Dips (3 work sets of 9) 1-Legged Squats (3 work sets of 7) Pull Ups/Chin Ups (3 work sets of 8-10) Inverted Rows (3 work sets of 8-10) Dumbbell Bench Press (3 work sets of 6-8) 

As far as I know, there's nothing you can do for preventing muscle soreness. But as soon as you get accustomed to the exercise, it should get better. As it basically boils down to providing nutrients to your muscle fibers, the quality of your nutrition matters as well, of course. 

Losing fat and maintaining weight implies building muscle. Building muscle and losing fat at the same time is difficult, although there is the phenomenon that sometimes works for novices. The only thing you can do is 

I'm wondering why is the single leg version of the deadlift is usually performed with stiff legs. For instance, exrx.net and most of the youtube videos that teach the single leg deadlift show it with stiff legs. What is the reason for this? Are there any risks when performing the single leg deadlift like the standard one? 

For advanced bodybuilders, their is often only either "bulk" (maintain body fat, build muscle), or "cut" (maintain muscle, decrease body fat).
