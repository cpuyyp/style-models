The answer is given here. One minute of time corresponds to 15 arcminutes (written as 15'). This is because in 24 h the Earth revolves 360º, so $$\textrm{angle per time} = \frac{360º}{24 \textrm{ h}} =\frac{21,600'}{1440 \textrm{ min}} = 15'/\textrm{min}.$$ If you turn this fraction upside down, you see that 1' corresponds to 1/15 min, or 4 seconds. That is, you measure the angle (let's call it $\theta$) of any of the star traces, as seen from the center (notice that the Northern Star is not exactly at the center, so that it itself traces a tiny arc instead of a dot). From the picture below, I get roughly $\theta = 135º$. The exposure time is thus: $$t_\mathrm{exp} = \frac{\theta}{\textrm{angle per time}} = \frac{135º}{360º/24 \textrm{ h}} \sim 9\textrm{ h}.$$ By the way, if you mark the position of the ends of the trails, you can recover the stellar sky. I found Ursa Major, marked by the yellow dots. 

Aabaakawad's answer highlights an important aspect of any constellation: They are defined by a surface area on the sky, behind which many, many stars hide. In order to answer just how many stars, you'll have to ask "above which brightness threshold?". I think you should accept his answer, but I have two comments: 

Since light travels at a constant and finite speed, looking into the Universe means looking back in time. No matter in which direction we look, on average we see the same: Locally, we see evolved galaxies, far away we see young galaxies, and even farther we see the so-called cosmic microwave background, which is light from so far back in time that galaxies hadn't yet formed. That is, the Universe seems to be isotropic. Unless we occupy a special place in the Universe, this implies that the Universe is also homogeneous, i.e. it would look more or less the same if you were located in another part of it. This is turn means that the current state of the Universe can be inferred by observering the local region. The most distant observed galaxies can then be concluded be in the same state (statistically speaking; of course they don't look exactly the same, but any given property, e.g. the distribution of their sizes, will be the same as in our neighborhood). 

Yes, space is constantly being created. The new space does not hold any matter (like atoms) or dark matter. This means that the density of normal and dark matter decreases at the same rate as the volume increases. However, dark energy, which is something completely different and thought to be a property of vacuum itself, is being created with the new space, so the density of dark energy stays constant. This in turns mean that while the early Universe (i.e. from it was 70,000 years old and until it was almost 10 billion years) was dominated by matter, the Universe is now dominated by dark energy. And it will only get worse. 

There definitely is no definition of what is low and what is high redshift — it is always seen in relation to something. An astronomer working in, say, the interstellar medium of the Milky Way ($z\sim0$) might talk about the ISM of a $z\sim2$ galaxy as being high redshift, whereas another astronomer working the reionization of the Universe (which took place around $z\sim10$) would consider $z\sim2$ to be low redshift. A cosmologist working in the CMB or inflation, however, would probably call $z\sim10$ low redshift. It all depends on the context. Nevertheless I think that most people would consider $z\lesssim0.1$ to be low redshift. 

The simplest assumption about the global properties of the Universe is that it looks the same outside the part that is observable to us, as it does inside. That is, we see a finite part of a Universe that is (probably) infinite in extend. If so, then the calculated age — which is finite — applies to all of the Universe, not just the observable part. The age is calculated on the basis of the observed expansion rate, and the observed densities of the constituents of the Universe. It is possible to imagine a universe with the right mixture of constituents that has existed forever$^{\dagger}$, but for our particular Universe, this just doesn't seem to be the case; it is ruled out by observations. As a first-order approximation, you can simply take the age $t_\mathrm{Uni}$ to be the reciprocal of the expansion rate $H_0 = 70\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} = 2\times10^{-18}$ s. That is, $$t_\mathrm{Uni} \sim \frac{1}{H_0} = 14\,\mathrm{billion\,years}.$$ However, this assumes that the Universe has been expanding at the same rate throughout its entire history, which is hasn't. More generally, the age is calculated from integrating (numerically except for simplified approximations) the Friedmann equation, yielding 13.819 billion years. I should say that the calculated age is the time from the Big Bang till now. I guess the safest thing to say is that we don't know what happened the first tiny fraction of a second or so after creation, and in principle it could have existed before this instant, collapsed, and then re-expanded. But no observations I know of suggest this. $^\dagger$An example of a temporally infinite universe is one containing energy only in the form of a cosmological constant. In this case, the Friedmann equation reduces to $da/dt=aH_0$, with $a$ the scale factor ("size") of the universe, the solution of which is an exponential function with zero size only at $t = -\infty$. 

Magnitude I'm wondering, however, if "the total luminosity within the bandpass" is really what you're interested in. This quantity doesn't really bear any physical significance for the source, as it depends on the particular filter. Usually, one would normalize to the filter, thus getting the magnitude, which is independent of the filter shape. In the AB magnitude system, the magnitude $m_\mathrm{AB}$ of a source is (Oke & Gunn 1983; note that they make a sign error in their own definition): $$ m_\mathrm{AB} = -2.5 \log f_\nu -48.6, $$ where the average $f_\nu$ in $\mathrm{erg} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2} \,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ is given by $$ f_\nu = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\int ST\lambda\,d\lambda}{\int T / \lambda\,d\lambda}, $$ where $S$ is the spectrum with units $\mathrm{erg} \,\mathrm{s}^{-1} \,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ Å$^{-1}$, $T$ is the filter curve (un-normalized as above), $\lambda$ is the wavelength in Ångström, and $c$ is the speed of light in Å $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. That is, a flat spectrum (in $\nu$) of height $f_\nu$ would have the same integrated flux over $T$ as $S$ would. So: 

Well, depending on where you live, the probability is either 0 or 1, modulo cloudy weather. From the picture below (from this site), you see that you'll need to be in the US to see the occultation. However, only in the regions outlined in cyan (West Alaska, East Siberia, East Canada, and in Caribbean islands east of the Dominican Republic) will it be during darkness (just before sunrise / after sunset). But with binoculars (or without, if you have very sharp eyes), you should be able to see it over all of the US. 

Yes, total Solar eclipses can occur anywhere. On any given place, they occur roughly every 400 years, on average. If you take a look on the picture below (from Wikipedia), you'll see that within the last one thousand year, almost every place on Earth has experienced a total Solar eclipse. The places that haven't experienced one have no special latitude or longitude, so it's just a matter of coincidence. 

This free streaming is still taking place. Photons travel in all directions, and are everywhere. The photons that you are able to see, are the ones that started out at a particular distance from you, and in a particular direction, but other photons started out at smaller and larger distances, and in other directions. You just don't see them, because you happen to be right here. But a person in another place of the Universe would see the same as you. The photons that we observe as the CMB come from a region we call the surface of last scattering, because it corresponds to the surface of a shell centered at us. But there is nothing special about this "surface", except that is consists of all points in the Universe that are so far from us, that it takes a photon roughly 13.8 billion years to travel. And because of the expansion, these points are now roughly 47 billion lightyears away from us. In the figure below, the arrows show CMB photons. All have the same length; they start where they were emitted and end where they are today. What we observe as the CMB are all arrows that end at the Milky Way (in the center). Other arrows may be observed by other observers in other galaxies that have their own surface of last scattering around them.
