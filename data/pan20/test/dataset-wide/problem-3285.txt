I'm sure I've read the following idea written by a linguist somewhere. I didn't manage to find the reference and I'd love to have serious references for that. The following is mainly a first person description of my native language's grammar, on an aspect which is not taught at school, but seems obvious in retrospect. Such an indigenous language is my native modern French ! The tense corresponding to mythological/ancestral past is passé simple (French Wikipedia link, with more details, but in French). Basically, this past tense was used for distant past event (older than 24h) in the 18th century but totally disappeared from oral speech by the beginning og the 20th century. It stayed in formal writing, and by now only appears in old text and fairy tales. For example, when my 8 years old niece invents a fairy tale, it is at the passé simple tense, and it is the only occasion she ever uses this tense. 

Under an exemplar theory approach, we would expect new words to be less innovative than high frequency words because a speaker hears less of them. References: Hay, J., Drager, K., & Thomas, B.

That is just a /t/ sound, not a morpheme. This makes as much sense as asking where the /n/ in near and nickel come from. The words night, fight, and others like right historically had a fricative before the /t/, and words like through and rough ended in that fricative (compare English through [θɹu:] with German durch [dʊɐ̯çç]). In Middle English, the fricative likely varied regionally, and it inconsistently either deleted (through, plough, night, fight, wight, drought) or became [f] (rough, trough, enough) in Modern English. Just because night and fight end in -ght it does not mean that sound was one morpheme. It just happens to be the consonant cluster they ended in. 

Since this sample is 164 characters long according to Twitter, it answers your question as specified. Another set of languages I would look for possible confusions would be the Nordic languages, specifically Danish and Norwegian Bokmål. But most generally, if you want to automatically find naturally occuring similar strings of text for different languages, I would look at this set of UDHR translations. Of course, if you are concerned about sentences specifically crafted to be ambiguous, I would bet it is possible to construct identical sentences in unrelated (or weakly related) languages, with different meanings. 

This document also contains many other examples. You also have some examples on the corresponding Wikipedia page. N’Ko N’Ko is a modern (20th century) RTL script used in western Africa for Manding languages. I happen to have an introductory book on N’Ko at home, and it ends with some example of elementary arithmetic operations, which are written right to left, as expected. Furthermore, the numbers in N’Ko (contrary to Arabic) are written right-to-left: The current year (2017) is written ߂߀߁߇, with (߂=2 ;߀=0 ;߁=1 ;߇=7). Remark on historical texts And if you look at historical texts, then you have lots of different conventions to adapt maths to different typographical traditions, including vertical writing in East Asia. (See e.g. this Unicode proposal pdf about notations used to translate Western mathematical texts in Ming and Qing China). 

For #3, for all of the vowels before /ɹ/, look at the phonetic environment. There's your explanation for why floor is [flɔɹ]. In very few dialects of Modern English, is [u:ɹ] even a sequence that is allowed. In my native dialect of English (Pacific Northwest American English), that segment is only phonotactically allowed if the [ɹ] is its own syllable. So brewer is [bɹu:w(ə)ɹ̩ ]. This is also true for me of [l]. Fool and fuel are definitely two syllables for me: [fuwəɤ̯ ]~[fuɫ̩ ] and [fjuwəɤ̯ ]~[fjuɫ̩ ] This is also true for my girlfriend, who speaks Australian English. So, we can surmise that when */o:/ became /u:/, it then lowered before [_l] and [_ɹ] in most dialects of English. For phonological splits, those are more tricky. In Southern British dialects of Early Modern English, there was another shift after the Great Vowel Shift called the FOOT~STRUT split. In Northern England and Scotland, as well as some dialects in Ireland, the vowels in FOOT is the same as the vowel in STRUT and FLOOD. Liverpool speakers would pronounce the vowel in FLOOD, RUN and SUN the same way they pronounce it in HOOD, FOOT, and BOOK. Here's a map of England where the Isoglosses of this split are, per Wikipedia (this is the vowel for SUN in various British dialects): 

Edit: add N’Ko I know of two modern living RTL mathematical tradition: Arabic and N’ko. I have no idea how other living RTL scripts (Hebrew, Dihevi, Syriac) deal with math. Arabic For Arabic (including other languages (Farsi, Urdu), written in the Arabic alphabet), there are three distinct traditions (Morocco, Maghreb, Mashrek), so I think the fraction order might be ambiguous depending on the country you're in. The W3C document on Arabic mathematical notations says, for this specific case : 

This confirms my native instinct. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have needed a linguist to notice the redundancies of my natural way to say “What is this ?” : «Qu’est-ce que c’est», literally, *“what is it that it is”. For me, «Qu’est-ce que» is just a fancy orthography for a word [kɛskə] translating the English “what”. The same question in 18th century French would have been asked by «Qu’est-ce ?». But est-ce without a following que is no longer used in spoken French, unless you want to sound archaic and/or formal. Obviously, given the chronology of this development, there is no way est-ce que could be cognate to similar interrogative words in any other language. 

Is this your homework assignment? *'Boys loves to cry.' Person agreement. *'She didn't went to the market.' Tense. A Generativist model would probably explain this as 'do' occupying the spot where tense normally is licensed. However, there are languages where double tense marking is grammatical (and also double person agreement; this is even found in one Indo-European Language: Bulgarian). 'They are going for the party, isn't it?' Actually this is grammatical. In some dialects of English in the UK this is grammatical. In many dialects, the clitic innit can be used even when referring to plural subjects, and even to personal pronouns. 'Isn't it' has been grammaticalised as a negative tag question: 'Dogs are in the room, innit?' 'You like pizza, innit?' Essentially, 'isn't it' can be used to mean: 

No, at least no documented languages have only front vowels. The general explanation for this is given by various theories for vowel dispersion. Schwartz, Boë, and Abry (1997) summarise one of these theories pretty well. Basically, there is a strong tendency for languages to spread their vowels evenly. Most theorise that this is because of learnability, others because of articulatory economy (Lindblom, 1975), others because they think systems self-organise in nature (de Boer, 2000). In 3 vowel systems, the most common vowels are /a/ /i/ /u/ with lots of speaker variation. In 5 vowel systems it tends to add in /e/ and /o/, 6 vowel systems most often add in a mid vowel like schwa. 7 or higher start getting rounding contrasts. There are languages with asymmetric vowel inventories. Many dialects of Danish have a highly asymmetric vowel inventory, with about twice as many front vowels as back vowels. Australian English also has a slightly asymmetric vowel inventory, with only 3 back vowels out of 11 monophongal minimal pairs. 

In the 1960’s, the linguist William Stokoe showed that the American Sign Language is a full fledged language, and subsequent linguistic studies confirmed that sign languages share all the characteristics of oral languages (expect the obvious sign/sound difference), and there is no reason to consider them differently. So ASL is “langue”, and the concrete signs used fore example in this video are “parole”, in a way similar to the analogue situations in English or any other language. By sign languages, I mean of course the languages used by deaf communities. The common misunderstanding that they’re not true language, might come from the fact that it is common for people to express simple notions by gestures (finger-pointing, expressing you’re tired, etc.), but this kind of signs are not a sign language, they are at best the equivalents of utterance like “Oh !” and “Yummy !” in English ! By contrast, sign languages can really express any notion an oral language can. I can’t personally speak any sign language, but, to give an example which impressed me, I have seen a live translation in French Sign Language of a PhD defence on biophotonics, where notions ranging from axon anatomy to optical interfermometry were discussed. 

Of course the two above sentences would both be highly ungrammatical in any American, Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian English dialects. 

One language I speak, Polish, has a fairly asymmetric vowel inventory despite having only 9* vowel phonemes (if you count the nasal diphthongs as vowels, that is) /i/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /ɛ̃ w/ /ɔ/ /ɔ̃ w/ a/ (The vowel [e] occurs as an allophone before /j/ or a palatalised consonant, the and /ɔ/ occurs as [o] before /w/ or /l/) There are two high front vowels, and the default tends to be +lax/-tense, rather than +tense/-lax (which is fairly unexpected). So there are languages with asymmetric vowel inventories, but none as extreme as only having front vowels. There are many reasons why this wouldn't happen, or would be highly improbable. For example, there is a tendency for languages to end up with an asymmetric inventory if [u] shifts forward to [y] or [ʉ], and sometimes to even shift forward to [y] and then un-round to [i]. Usually, what happens though, is the vowel does not shift forward before [k] [x] or another velar consonant, and then they wind up in allophonic variation, or over time, even in phonemic variation. Another tendency is for [o] to raise and fill the place of where [u] used to be. So let's say a 5 vowel inventory language has: /i/ /u/ /e/ /o/ /a/ It shifts: /i/ /y/~/u/ /e/ /o/ /a/ Then, a few generations later we have: /i//y/ /u/ (o shifted up) /e/ /a/ Or even: /i//y/ /u/ (the vowel became contrastive) /e/ /o/ /a/ *There is debate on even this in Polish, sadly. The controversy is over the front vowels, and whether the contrastive vowel is [ɪ] or [ɨ]. In many Slavic languages, such as Russian, there are two vowels in allophonic distribution: one occurs after palatalised consonants and /k/ [i], the other after non-palatalised consonants [ɨ]. Sanders (2003) identified the Polish vowel as [ɪ], at least in Warsaw Polish. In Polish, the only consonants with a palatalisation contrast are the bilabials, and before a back vowel. Some Slavicists like to transcribe the bilabials before /i/ as being something like [mʲ] instead of [m]. If you don't do this for pure consistency-with-other-Slavic-languages concerns, it is fairly obvious that /ɪ/ and /i/ are minimal pairs: /mi/ 1sg-DAT /mɪ/ 'we' /bitɕ/ 'to beat' /bɪtɕ/ 'to be' They are phonemic at least in the environment of bilabials.

Warning: I am not a linguist! This post is essentially a long comment on French’s use of est-ce que and your exclusion of it because “it’s a whole phrase”. I think est-ce que in modern French is not a “whole phrase” anymore, at least in colloquial French, so colloquial French is an example of Indo-European language with such an interrogative particle. (In the citation bellow, Rodney ball mentions the Polish czy, which would be another example). The difference between formal written French and spoken French are quite large, even in grammar. While est-ce que is currently part of standard French, it doesn’t sound very formal to my native ears and is discouraged in formal writings. I believe it is a relatively recent development in French, but I clearly do not analyse it instinctively as a “whole phrase”. Rodney Ball, in his (excellent) Colloquial French Grammar, section 2.2.1, says
