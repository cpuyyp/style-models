Economists have been exploring control theory applications to macro economics for decades. For example, here is a 40 year-old research paper written in 1976 on the topic. 

No need to seek a mechanism because the inverted yield curve occurs by definition in the scenario you describe. This Investopedia video defines inverted yield curve as follows: 

In nearly every public school district in the U.S., one can observe the following pattern: There are fewer middle schools than elementary schools. And there are fewer high schools than middle schools. (And the count of students per school goes inversely as the count of schools.) But why is this the case? Is there any explanation for this based on economic principles? For example, why is the reverse not the case? Why are there not fewer elementary schools than high schools, let's say? 

They don't know for certain. It's an inexact science. They do the best they can. Alan Greenspan was known for pouring over all the economic data available for hours while mostly in the bathtub trying to make sense of what was happening in the economy. But ultimately, it came down to making an informed decision based on knowledge, reasoning, experience and intuition. Policy objectives (which are quasi-political) can also come into play as sometimes desired results can compete. The classic example of this is economic growth vs. inflation. Critics of government monopolized central banks argue that it is impossible for any single individual or group of policy makers to choose rates correctly and overnight interbank lending rates should be allowed to float freely and be determined by the market vis-a-vis supply-demand equilibrium. Hence the popularity of LIBOR and to a lessor extent EURIBOR as these are closer to market pricing than, say, the Fed Funds Rate. However, these are still only averages of central bank policy decision and, therefore, are not purely market-driven. 

Let's define $P^*$ the price of market equilibrium, $Q_D$ as the quantity demanded and $E_D$ as price elasticity of demand. Then: $$ {slope} = \frac{rise}{run} = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q_D} $$ And in mathematical terms, the verbal description of the PED reduces to: $$ E_D = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_D}{Q_D} \cdot 100}{\frac{\Delta P}{P^*} \cdot 100} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{\Delta Q_D} {\Delta P} $$ $$ E_D = \frac{P^*}{Q_D} \cdot \frac{1}{slope} $$ Edit Constructive comments have been incorporated into this answer. In particular, @Kontorus pointed out: 

The division comes from the entities guiding these sets of policies. The austerity program falls under fiscal policy, which is controlled by Parliament. Quantitative easing falls under monetary policy, which is controlled by the Bank of England. The policies enacted by these two entities are not necessarily coordinated, and can sometimes work opposite each other's objective. 

Consider the following example with a Cobb-Douglas production function having total factor productivity $A_t$, labor $L_t$, capital $K_t$, and effort $e_t$: $$ Y_t = A_t K_t^{\alpha} (e_tL_t)^{(1-\alpha)}$$ The intensive margin regards the level of effort $e_t$ (think intensity), and the extensive margin the quantity of labor supplied $L_t$. In a less abstract sense, think about output and hours worked. You can work for 2 hours at a normal pace and create one widget. Or, if you try very hard, you could make one widget in one hour. How do you get the same output from the same worker with different values of $L$? The intensive margin is the answer. 

Your question touches on seigniorage, which is the revenues a government receives from printing money. The issue is that, while the government may benefit (in the short run) from the additional revenues, the holders of money are penalized because their money becomes less valuable. While a low level of seigniorage is typically acceptable, if it becomes clear a government is going to finance the majority of its expenditures this way, then the government risks hyperinflation and a loss of confidence in the currency. Further, selling bonds can be beneficial for a few reasons. One, when a country participates in international capital markets, the act of paying off debt creates positive relationships with lenders and can lower borrowing costs. Two, it allows a government to smooth its expenditures over time. When the economy returns to healthy growth and is able to generate a surplus, the government will again be able to pay off debt it accumulated during leaner times. 

Check out the following: Jordi Gali; Monetary Policy, Inflation, and the Business Cycle: An Introduction to the New Keynesian Framework David Romer; Advanced Macroeconomics Michael Woodford; Interest and Prices: Foundations of a Theory of Monetary Policy The first two will ground you in the theory of nominal rigidities and the business cycle. Woodford's book is a good advanced text on the theory of monetary policy. I would not start with Woodford to understand the basic New Keynesian model. Practice problems with the first two books first, then move on to Woodford. 

It would depend a lot on how the debt was "erased." If you are simply suggesting a transfer payment from creditor to debtor, what would force such an event? Or would it be voluntary? If it were forced, then you would have a threat to private property rights and therefore, a disincentive for further lending. Security of capital would be diminished and all investment might stop overnight. This question is very broad. But the answer of what might happen would depend very much on the details of how all this might come about. 

It depends on whether all the tickets are sold or not. If sold out, all the the tax burden is borne by the buyers. If not, then it's shared. If sold out, buyers pay all the tax. If all 39,000 tickets are sold, then your reasoning holds correct. The revenue the owners receive with the tax will equal the income to the owners without the tax. $$R = P \cdot Q_{max}$$ Where $R$ is the total revenue from ticket sales to owners, $P$ is the average ticket price, $Q(P)$ is the total quantity of tickets sold and $Q_{max}$ is the total quantity of tickets available to be sold (39,000 in this case). $$ Q_{max} = 39,000 $$ The total amount of tax revenue received by the government will equal the total amount of taxes paid by the ticket buyers. $$T_{paid} = T_{received} = \$5 \times 39,000 = \$195,000$$ If not, the tax burden is shared. When the stadium does not sell out, then the price elasticity of demand kicks in and causes both parties to share the tax burden. Keep in mind, the ticket sellers still earn the same amount per ticket, their shared tax burden (economic loss) comes from a reduced number of ticket sales due to the increase in ticket cost paid by the ticket buyers. The reduction in ticket sales represents a cost of lost opportunity of a perishable asset (i.e., the unsold tickets). The amount the buyers, in aggregate, reduce their ticket purchases will be proportional to the price elasticity of demand. The below diagram shows the impact of taxation on ticket sales, price and quantity sold. 

It is generally not possible to make a sharp statement about the types of non-convex costs that Dynare can handle. Many different factors come into play about whether a model can be "solved" by Dynare or not. Is the steady-state correctly defined? Is the model stationary? Is the model differentiable everywhere in the ergodic set? Are the number of endogenous and exogenous variables equal to the number of equations? Is the model Blanchard-Kahn stable? But, to answer your question, can Dynare solve a model with a state-contingent fixed cost? Yes. This is not difficult, you should try to create one yourself. Try modifying a simple RBC model with capital and bonds. The trouble is not inducing the cost, but rather finding the steady state, which can be quite onerous if not done cleverly. Dynare, however, cannot solve Iacoviello and Pavan 2013 because of the min function found in a borrowing constraint. This min function induces a point in the ergodic set which is not differentiable. Dynare numerically approximates optimal policy functions about a steady state using perturbation methods. This requires employing the implicit function theorem to build out Taylor expansions of the optimal policies, hence you must be able to take derivatives everywhere within the ergodic set. 

Dynamic Programming & Optimal Control by Bertsekas Introduction to Modern Economic Growth by Acemoglu The Acemoglu book, even though it specializes in growth theory, does a very good job presenting continuous time dynamic programming. 

Try writing your equation explicitly with a conditional expectation operator: $$ \mathbb{E}_t f(\alpha_t, \beta_t, s_t, s_{t+1}) = 0$$ Hopefully this clarifies things. You can take the total derivative as you normally would with any function, however $s_{t+1}$ is a random variable since it is not predetermined. Ultimately you are considering all cases of $s_{t+1}$ weighted by their probability. Since $\mathbb{E}_t$ integrates over shocks, you can differentiate under the integral sign by Leibniz's integration rule. 

Imagine a consumption set on the surface of an infinite dimensional unit sphere, where the dimensions are indexed by the counting numbers and represent different varieties of goods. The consumer prefers goods found in higher dimensions. So the 1 unit of good on the second dimension is preferred to the 1 unit of good on the first dimension. Thus, the consumer is never satiated because they would always prefer one unit of a good found in a higher dimension, and there are infinitely many dimensions. But these preferences do not satisfy monotonicity, because you must always give up a little bit of at least one good to acquire more of another. Hence, these preferences are rational, because you can rank all pairs on the surface of the sphere, and transitivity holds trivially. 

Corporations are essential and they do provide benefits to the overall economy. Corporations are essential in the sense than individuals, when given the freedom to choose, do choose to invest their capital in corporations. And these corporations, in turn, use this capital to produce products and services which other people voluntarily purchase. Corporations are a net benefit to the economies in which they operate because they produce products which customers voluntarily purchase for prices which allow the corporations to return a profit to their shareholders. To the extent there are exceptions to this vis-a-vis crony corporations and government subsidies, the previous paragraph is notwithstanding. 

Yes. It is a fair comparison. Human nature, market behavior and principles of finance and economics have not changed much in the recorded history of mankind. For example, the principles set forth by Adam Smith in his opus The Wealth of Nations are just as relevant today as they were in 1776 when the book was published. 

There is also this concept of creative destruction. Which basically means that old less productive technologies must die in order to free up resources to be made available to new, more productive technologies. It's analogous to pruning. But it occurs naturally in a free market economy and does not require management or government intervention. Protectionism impedes the natural and beneficial process of creative destruction. 

Non-linear adaptive human behavior, uncertainty and governmental decentralization of control (i.e., democracy) are the main reasons I believe control theory has not become a more common tool for policy makers. Economics is simply not an exact science. Whereas engineering is more so. So control theory is more useful in the engineering discipline. 

If short term rates are positive and long term rates are negative then short term rates must be higher than long term rates. Therefore, the yield curve will be considered inverted by definition. Remember, central banks set the interbank overnight lending rate as a matter of policy. In the U.S., this is called the Federal Reserve Funds Rate. This is the shortest possible maturity. So this is the leftmost point on the yield curve. By contrast, supply-demand equilibrium (i.e., the market) sets long-term bond prices. And, as we know, bond prices are inversely correlated to their yields. So when the market demand increases for long term bonds, their prices rise and their yields fall.
