This question is about 6 operations formalism for 'crystalline' cohomology theories - more specifically the infinitesimal cohomology of smooth $\mathbb{C}$-varieties, and the overconvergent cohomology of varieties in positive characteristic. I'm not really sure of a good reference for the former, for the latter I'm talking about le Stum's site theoretic approach to rigid cohomology, as developed in his paper "The Overconvergent Site". In particular, I'm interested in whether or not one might hope for a 6 operations formalism for the cohomology of the overconvergent site. One thing that suggests to me that this is not the 'right' set-up to get 6 operations is that I think I can convince myself that for any Cartesian square of $k$-varieties ($k$ a perfect field of characteristic $p>0$) $$ \begin{matrix} X' & \overset{g'}\rightarrow &X \\ f'\downarrow &&\downarrow f \\ Y' & \overset{g}{\rightarrow} &Y\end{matrix}$$ the induced base change morphism $$ g^*_{\mathrm{An}^\dagger} \mathbb{R}f_{\mathrm{An}^\dagger*}E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}f'_{\mathrm{An}^\dagger*}g'_{\mathrm{An}^\dagger}^*E$$ is an isomorphism. This seems 'wrong' to me - one should only expect such a base change for a proper morphism $f$. My question is whether or not this should be taken seriously as a reason why 6 operations with good 'topological' properties won't exist in this context, or is there something I've missed? I'd also be interested to know whether or not 6 operations has been worked out for the infinitesimal site of $\mathbb{C}$-varieties (or varieties over any alg. closed char $0$ field). In the introduction to another paper of his, "Constructible $\nabla$-modules on curves", le Stum says that constructible sheaves have a definition in terms of the infinitesimal site (due to Deligne, but unpublished), but what about complexes and six operations? Is there anything known in this direction? Also, just for reference, the argument that we have base change for any Cartesian square is basically just combining the paragraph before 1.4.2 of $URL$ with 7.28.1 of $URL$ One can also see it in terms of realisations. EDIT: It may be worth making clear that I am familiar with both Caro's theory of 6 operations for overholonomic $F\text{-}\mathcal{D}^\dagger$-modules, and the theory of algebraic $\mathcal{D}$-modules in char $0$. I am more interested in whether or not, for example in char $0$, one can do all this purely in terms of the infinitesimal site. 

The morphism $\mathbb{H}^*(X,DR(\mathcal{F},\nabla))\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^*(X^\mathrm{an},DR(\mathcal{F}^\mathrm{an},\nabla^\mathrm{an}))$ is always an isomorphism when $\mathcal{F}$ is regular. This is Theoreme 6.2 of Deligne's book $URL$ The reason (explained in Chapter 2) is that in the regular case, denoting by $j:X\rightarrow \bar{X}$ the inclusion, natural map $DR(\bar{\mathcal{F}},\bar{\nabla})\rightarrow \mathbb{R}j_*DR(\mathcal{F},\nabla)=j_*DR(\mathcal{F},\nabla)$ is a quasi-isomorphism of complexes, and so we get $\mathbb{H}^*(\bar{X},DR(\bar{\mathcal{F}},\bar{\nabla}))\cong \mathbb{H}^*(X,DR(\mathcal{F},\nabla))$ by taking hypercohomology. You have a similar isomorphism $\mathbb{H}^*(\bar{X}^\mathrm{an},DR(\bar{\mathcal{F}}^\mathrm{an},\bar{\nabla}^\mathrm{an}))\cong \mathbb{H}^*(X^\mathrm{an},DR(\mathcal{F}^\mathrm{an},\nabla^\mathrm{an}))$ on the analytic side, and combining this with the GAGA isomorphism in the proper case gives you the version of Grothendieck's theorem you want. I'm not sure how compact support fits into the picture, though. 

In the introduction to his paper "Towards a non-abelian $p$-adic Hodge theory", Olsson says that for any ringed topos $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{O})$ with $\mathcal{O}$ a sheaf of $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras, the category $\mathrm{dga}_{\mathcal{O}}$ of $\mathcal{O}$-dga's has a model category structure, where the weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms, and the fibrations are surjections with level wise injective kernel (injective as objects in the category of $\mathcal{O}$-modules). Now, it seems to me the proof of this fact goes something along the following lines. Since the category of $\mathcal{O}$-modules has enough injectives, then the category of positively graded chain complexes has a similarly defined model category structure. One takes generating sets cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations in this model category of chain complexes, and one applies the 'free algebra functor' from complexes to dga's and the small object argument to get generating sets of cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations in the category of dga's. My question is the following. Do we really need to restrict to $\mathbb{Q}$-algebras here? Or will this argument work for any ringed topos $(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{O})$? For example, will the above definitions of weak equivalences and fibrations define a model category structure on the category of sheaves of $\mathbb{Z}/\ell^n$-modules in the étale topos of some scheme? I can't see where the argument breaks down, but I may not have understood it well enough. 

As you imply, you can identify $\varprojlim_n \mathrm{Pic}(X_n)$ with $\mathrm{Pic}(\hat{X})$, the Picard group of the completion of $X$, but think that you can deduce that the natural functor $\mathrm{Pic}(X)\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}(\hat{X})$ is an equivalence from the theorem you state. What does follow is that the functor is fully faithful, since $$\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{L},\mathcal{M})\cong H^0(X,\mathcal{L}^\vee\otimes \mathcal{M}) \cong H^0(\hat{X},\hat{\mathcal{L}}^\vee\otimes \hat{\mathcal{M}})\cong \mathrm{Hom}(\hat{\mathcal{L}},\hat{\mathcal{M}})$$ but you need more than isomorphisms on cohomology to deduce essentially surjectivity. $\mathcal{O}_X^*$ is definitely not coherent (what's the $\mathcal{O}_X$-module structure?) so you can't apply the theorem. Actually, the result you state is numbered as 5.1.2 in EGA3.1, and Theorem 5.1.4 on the next page is the result that the completion functor is an equivalence of categories between coherent modules on $X$ and those on $\hat{X}$. The proof there certainly doesn't follow straightforwardly from the isomorphism on cohomology, it goes by showing that every coherent sheaf is a quotient of a direct sum of (negative) powers of an ample line bundle. So maybe I've misunderstood your question? 

As Jonathan said, the answer is always, and the left adjoint $f_!$ has a simple description as the "extension by $\emptyset$" functor. Think of an open immersion $j:U\rightarrow X$ of topological spaces, then we have the usual extension by $\emptyset$ functor by sheafififying the presheaf $j_!\mathcal{F}(W)=\mathcal{F}(W)$ if $W\subset U$ $j_!\mathcal{F}(W)=\emptyset$ otherwise. It's an easy calculation to show that this is left adjoint to $j^*$. Translating this to the étale topology, if $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is an étale morphism of schemes, we have the extension by $\emptyset$ functor by sheafififying the presheaf $f_!\mathcal{F}(W\overset{f}{\rightarrow} Y)=\coprod_{g\in\mathrm{Hom}_Y(W,X)}\mathcal{F}(W\overset{g}{\rightarrow} X)$ and again it's fairly easy to verify that $f_!$ does what we want it to. It's worth noting that to get an adjoint for abelian sheaves, we need to replace this coproduct by the coproduct in the category of abelian sheaves, i.e. direct sum. Thus $f_!\mathcal{F}$ depends on whether we are considering $\mathcal{F}$ as a sheaf of sets or of abelian groups. It's possibly also worth noting that we don't get a geometric morphism $f^*:\mathrm{Sh}(Y)\leftrightarrows \mathrm{Sh}(X):f_!$ because $f_!$ doesn't preserve limits. Despite this, the version of $f_!$ for abelian sheaves is actually exact! 

This is a question about the category $F\text{-}D^b_\mathrm{coh}(\mathscr{D}^\dagger_{\mathscr{X},\mathbb{Q}})$ of complexes of arithmetic $\mathscr{D}$-modules with Frobenius structure on a smooth formal scheme $\mathscr{X}$ over a complete $p$-adic DVR, as constructed by Berthelot. Let's assume that we're in the situation where the Frobenius of the special fribre of $\mathscr{X}$ lifts to an endomorphism of $\mathscr{X}$. My question is this - it seems to me from Berthelot's papers that this category is defined as follows. The objects are complexes $E\in D^b_\mathrm{coh}(\mathscr{D}^\dagger_{\mathscr{X},\mathbb{Q}})$, together with an isomorphism $\varphi:F^*E\rightarrow E$ in $D^b_\mathrm{coh}(\mathscr{D}^\dagger_{\mathscr{X},\mathbb{Q}})$. The morphism are then morphisms $E\rightarrow E'$ in $D^b_\mathrm{coh}(\mathscr{D}^\dagger_{\mathscr{X},\mathbb{Q}})$ which are compatible with Frobenius, that is one gets a commutative square $$ \begin{matrix} F^*E & \rightarrow & E \\\downarrow &&\downarrow\\F^*E' & \rightarrow & E'. \end{matrix} $$ Since the question of the definition of the category of complexes with Frobenius in Berthelot and Caro's papers is in fact rather brief (see for example 5.1.1 of this paper $URL$ and this point is not really expanded upon (at least, I couldn't fin it expanded upon) in any of Caro's later papers on the subject, I am not 100% sure that I've got this right. My question is then very simply this - is this the correct interpretation of the definition of the category $F\text{-}D^b_\mathrm{coh}(\mathscr{D}^\dagger_{\mathscr{X},\mathbb{Q}})$? Or is there a subtlety that I've missed? 

I've been reading Kedlaya's paper $URL$ on finiteness of rigid cohomology and there's something I can't quite resolve in my understanding of the topology on the Robba ring. Let's take $K$ to be a complete $p$-adic field ($\mathbb{Q}_p$ if you want), with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ and uniformiser $\pi$. Then the Robba ring $\mathcal{R}_K$ over $K$ consists of those series $\sum_{i\in\mathbb{Z}} a_it^i$ with $a_i\in K$ such that for all $\eta<1$ $\vert a_i\vert\eta^i\rightarrow 0$ as $i\rightarrow \infty$, and there exists some $\xi<1$ such that $|\vert a_i\vert\xi^i\rightarrow 0$ as $i\rightarrow -\infty$. As far as I understand (although this may be one of the things I've got wrong), there are partially defined norms $\lVert\sum_i a_it^i \rVert_r=\sup_i\{\vert a_i \vert p^{-ir}\}$ for $r>0$, and these induces a topology on $\mathcal{R}_K$, for which a sequence $f_n\rightarrow 0$ iff for all sufficiently small $r>0$, the norms $\lVert f_n \rVert_r$ are all defined and tend towards zero. (This seems to be the definition of the topology on Robba rings given by Kedlaya.) The Robba ring also contains an integral subring $\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{int}_K$ consisting of series $\sum_i a_it^i$ such that each $a_i\in \mathcal{O}_K$, and Definition 2.5.10 of Kedlaya's paper says that this subring can be topologically characterised as the set of elements $f$ such that for any $a\geq0$ and any $c\in K$ with $\vert c\vert<1$, the sequence $(cf^a)^n$ converges to $0$ in $\mathcal{R}_K$. Actually, it's not too difficult to see that $\mathcal{R}_K^\mathrm{int}$ has to be contained in the set of `topologically bounded' elements, and it seems plausible that the converse is also true. Either way, $\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{int}_K$ is a DVR, with maximal ideal generated by $\pi$, and the quotient $\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{int}_K/(\pi)$ is just the Laurent series field $k((t))$ over the residue field $k$ of $K$. Again, looking at Definition 2.5.10 of Kedlaya's paper, there is a topological characterisation of the ideal $(\pi)$ inside $\mathcal{R}_K^\mathrm{int}$ - he says that the set of topologically nilpotent elements in $\mathcal{R}_K^\mathrm{int}$ forms an ideal and the quotient by this ideal is again isomorphic to $k((t))$. But now let's look at the element $t$ of $\mathcal{R}_K^\mathrm{int}$. Then for all $r>0$ we have $\lVert t^n \rVert_r = p^{-nr}\rightarrow 0$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$, which says that $t$ is topologically nilpotent. But $t$ is a unit in $\mathcal{R}_K^\mathrm{int}$, so something's gone wrong! Where have I made my mistake? 

This answer is due to Jon Pridham. While we might not expect $H^i(G_k,V)=H^i(G_k^\mathrm{alg},V)$ for every finite dimensional, continuous $G_k$-representation $V$, there are certain results from the motivic theory that suggest that this might be true if $k$ is a number field (or local field of char $0$), and that the representation 'comes from geometry'. So although we possible should not expect a schematic homotopy type $h(\mathrm{Spec}(k))$ which is a gerbe, and whose derived category of perfect complexes is equivalent to $D^b_c(\mathrm{Spec}(k)_\mathrm{et},\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$, there may well be a gerbe whose derived category of perfect complexes is equivalent to the subcategory of $D^b_c(\mathrm{Spec}(k)_\mathrm{et},\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$ generated by complexes of geometric origin, at least when $k$ is a number field. Essentially, the existence of the motivic $t$-structure 'almost' implies that the motivic schematic homotopy type is a gerbe, from which it would follow that the $\ell$-adic schematic homotopy type associated to motivic representations (i.e. representations of geometric origin) is a gerbe. 

I don't think so. Here's a possible counter example. Take $X=\mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{C}$, $M=(\mathcal{O}_X,\nabla)$ where $\nabla(f)=df-fdz$, $z$ being the co-ordinate on $\mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{C}$. Then $RHom_{\mathcal{D}_X}(M,M)=End_\nabla(M)=\{g\in \mathcal{O}_X \mid dg=0 \}=\mathbb{C}$, and the locally constant sheaf of horizontal sections of $M$ on $X^\mathrm{an}$ is just isomorphic to the constant sheaf $\mathbb{C}_{X^\mathrm{an}}$, with basis the globally defined exponential map. Hence $RHom_{\mathbb{C}_{X^\mathrm{an}}}(DR(M),DR(M))=\mathbb{C}$. But $M$ is not regular. 

Suppose that $k$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p>0$, $\mathcal{V}$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with residue field $k$ and quotient field $K$, of characteristic $0$. Then when one does rigid cohomology, or looks at arithmetic $\mathcal{D}$-modules, a hypothesis that often comes up is that of a $k$-variety $X$ being `realisable' or 'embedable', i.e. there exisisting a smooth formal $\mathcal{V}$-scheme $\mathfrak{X}$, topologically of finite type, and a locally closed immersion $X\hookrightarrow \mathfrak{X}$ such that the closure $\overline{X}$ of $X$ in $\mathfrak{X}$ is proper over $k$ (if you want, you could strengthen this to there existing a smooth and proper $\mathcal{V}$-scheme $\mathfrak{X}$ and a locally closed embedding $X\hookrightarrow \mathfrak{X}$). The notion of being embeddable comes up if you want to define the rigid cohomology of your variety $X$ directly, in general you use the fact that every variety is locally embeddable (since affine varieties are embeddable) to define rigid cohomology by gluing. My question is: does anyone know of an example of a non-embeddable variety over $k$ (for either the stronger or slightly weaker notion of embeddability)? There are certainly examples of non-quasi projective varieties, and non-liftable smooth and projective varieties, but obviously being non-embeddable is much stronger than this. Is anything known if we are allowed to make isometric extensions of $K$? 

Have a look at Ravi Vakil's notes on Algebraic geometry, 18.1.8, 18.9.A (and possibly tracing through the results used in these sections) $URL$ The point is that $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is affine, then $X\cong \underline{\mathrm{Spec}}(f_*\mathcal{O}_X)$, and if $f$ is proper, then $f_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is coherent. Hence $X$ is the relative spectrum of a coherent $\mathcal{O}_Y$-algebra, and hence finite. 

We can see what $\ker(\nabla^\mathrm{an})$ will be by the following reasoning (which can be made a bit more precise): $\nabla(f)=0\Leftrightarrow \frac{df}{f}=-\alpha\frac{dt}{t}\Leftrightarrow \log(f)=-\alpha\log(t)+c\Leftrightarrow f=c_0t^{-\alpha}$. So local sections of $\ker(\nabla^\mathrm{an})$ will then just be multiples of some fixed branch of the function $t\mapsto t^{-\alpha}$. Global sections of this will exist iff $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}$, and so in this case we can see that $H^0(\mathbb{G}_m^\mathrm{an},(\mathcal{O}^\mathrm{an},\nabla^\mathrm{an}))$ will be zero if $\alpha\notin\mathbb{Z} $ and $\mathbb{C}\cdot t^{-\alpha}$ otherwise. On the other hand, algebraic de Rham cohomology will just be the cohomology of the complex of $k[t,t^{-1}]$-modules $0\rightarrow k[t,t^{-1}]\overset{f\mapsto f'+\frac{f\alpha}{t}}{\rightarrow} k[t,t^{-1}]\rightarrow0$ Thus elements of $H^0(\mathbb{G}_{m,k},(\mathcal{O},\nabla))$ will be (multiples of) global algebraic branches of $t\mapsto t^{-\alpha}$. Again, if $\alpha\in\mathbb{Z}$, then this $H^0$ is just $k\cdot t^{-\alpha}$ and if $\alpha\notin\mathbb{Z}$ it will be zero. I'm not sure how to see 'directly' that the two $H^1$'s will be the same though. 

I have been reading Hyodo-Kato's paper on log-crystalline cohomology, and there is one statement there that has been troubling me. To explain this, suppose we have a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$, with ring of Witt vectors $W$. Let $X/W$ be a semistable scheme, that is a regular, proper scheme over $W$, étale locally smooth over some $W[x_1,\ldots,x_d]/(x_1\ldots x_d-p)$. Let $X_k$ denote the special fibre. Then we may put a log structure on $X$, which is simply that given by the special fibre, in other words the sheaf of monoids $M$ is the sheaf of functions on $X$ invertible outside of $X_k$, and the map $M\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_X$ is the inclusion. Let $(X,M)$ denote the associated log scheme, and let $(X_k^\times,\overline{M})$ denote the pullback of this log structure to the special fibre $X_k$. Then the following fact is implicit in their paper: the log scheme $(X_k^\times,\overline{M})$ depends on the scheme $X\otimes_W W/(p^2)$. My question is essentially: why is this the case? Naively, I would have thought that this should be described étale locally by the chart $\mathbb{N}^d\mapsto \mathcal{O}_{X_s}$ given by $(0,\ldots,0,1,0,\ldots,0)\mapsto x_i$ (with $1$ in the $i$th place), which clearly only depends on the special fibre $X_s^\times$. So why is this not the correct description, and is there a simple description in terms of charts?
