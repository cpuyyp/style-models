I had a friend who lost a significant amount of weight from bouldering and climbing. What was remarkable about his weight loss is that as he began to shed pounds, his climbing strength and abilities soared unbelievably. If you think about it, he had been weight training on the wall for a couple of years carrying all his extra mass up with him, so first of all he developed the strength he needed so he could climb as heavy as he was. Then after he started to lose weight, his strength to weight ratio began to increase, which resulted in transforming him into a stronger than average climber. The only concern he had was taking a fall on belay. Whoever was belaying him usually went for a trip up the wall after he took a fall, so if he fell too close to the ground, then he was hitting bottom. The person on belay needs to be prepared to go for a lift in the event of a fall if they aren't heavier, or near the same weight as the climber. When top-roping, some belayers anchor themselves to the floor to prevent lift-offs. I don't recommend anchoring the belayer to the ground if they're lighter than the climber, it actually puts more stress on the rope and gear after a fall. anchoring is of course unavoidable when multi pitching, in which case you want to anchor your belay directly to the wall on the bolts instead of your harness when sport climbing. When trad climbing, you may want to use an extra piece in the direction of pull in case of a fall. 

The only layer I change is the Gore-Tex shells; the Polyester pants are very breathable, and Schoeller is just magic, I can literally watch my perspiration freezing on top of the fabric after it breathes through. When I'm going up hill, I don't wear the Gore-Tex pants, but as soon as I get to the top, or if I get to a really windy spot, then I'll zip them on and I don't even have to take my skis off. At warmer temperatures closer to zero, or during activities where I'm working a lot–like nordic skiing–I won't always wear the fleece pants, as my long johns generally keep me warm enough under the Schoeller pants. If I'm concerned about cold toes, then I'll always dress warmer on the bottom, like when I'm snowshoeing in my light hikers and have my toes strapped down, the extra warmth on my legs means more warm blood pumping through my feet, which amounts to cozy toes. 

Avalanche shovels come equipped with holes in the blades for use as rescue sleds and making anchors. I've got plenty of my own ideas, but I'm looking for any documentation provided by manufacturers about how to properly set up an avalanche shovel as a snow fluke. I've got a couple of BCA extendable shovels with the four holes in the blade like the one pictured below. 

I had to cheat of course, I removed the bar that attaches the toe and heel peices, then overlapped them. But looking at the crampons, I think they fit a size 32 natively (US/CAN size 1). There isn't really a market for children's-sized technical crampons. I think the best thing you're going to find on the market is probably a pair of slip-on shoe spikes such as what I have pictured below: 

One thing all climbers have in common, is a big poofy down jacket. Your fingers are only going to be as warm as your core is, so keep your core warm, and that nice warm blood will circulate to your fingers. Only take your jacket off when it's your turn to climb. For extra warmth, drink hot chocolate while you're wearing your poofy jacket and you're fingers will be nice and toasty when you want them to be. Even though I'm in Canada, there's rock climbing here all year. People go bouldering out in Frank Slide all through the winter, so cold climbing fingers is something I'm very familiar with. Poofy jacket, and mitts while you wait your turn are how you stay warm. 

In Canyoning/Canyoneering, floating ropes are used to make rope management a lot easier. Unfortunately for those of us interested in canyoning who don't live in Europe, specialized canyoning gear isn't easy to come by. Is it possible to treat a regular static rope so that it will float? 

They are essentially the same knot on the rope, they're both friction hitches. The difference is how they connect to your harness. Distel hitches are used mostly by arborists, one advantage a distel hitch has over a prussik is how well it works in combination with a pulley system: 

The disciplines are very similar, and it is very easy for a climber to make the transition because they already have experience with ropes, but there are a lot of canyoneering specific skills and gadgets that are different from climbing. If I were to campare the two by their differences, I'd say that rock climbing requires more strength, and canyoneering requires more wisdom. First of all, when canyoneering you obviously spend a lot more time on your ropes, so the first essential skill you need to learn how to do is how to make anchors for descending while pulling your ropes. It is incredibly easy to get a rope stuck in a canyon, and when it happens it could mean big trouble, chances are you'll have to cut your rope and hope there's enough left over to make it the rest of the way out if you don't have a second rope (which you probably should). Canyoning descenders are different too, they offer many different levels of friction, and are easy to tie off if you need to stop and go hands free. Canyoning Descenders Kong Hydrobot 

I traversed my first glacier when I was 5 years old in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park. For the most part, if you're following an established trail, then you likely aren't going to be venturing far enough onto the glacier to be met with any serious danger. The crossings will likely be like hiking in spring snow. Chances are you're going to be following a very well used and defined trail trampled down by the many hikers before you. That being said, whenever venturing into glacier terrain it's wise to familiarize yourself with safe glacier travel practices, and to be able to identify glacial features. Crevasses for example (large and deep cracks in the ice) are a serious danger on glaciers. Glaciers are in a constant state of flow, like a very slow moving river. When a glacier flows over a bulge, it stresses the ice which can cause crevasses to open up at the surface. These crevasses can be hundreds of metres deep. Snow can blow over the crevasse opening, creating a snow bridge and concealing the crevasse. Often these snow bridges are strong enough that they can be safely crossed, but when people fall into crevasses it almost always because they are unknowingly walking over a snow bridge, and it breaks beneath them. Bringing a 20m rope for glacier walking would be a wise precaution. If there are only two of you tied to either end of the rope, then it's recommended you tie a few knots in the rope between you to act as stoppers to help slow or stop a fall if one of you falls into a crevasse. If you're hiking with poles, you can use them to probe the snow ahead of you for hidden crevasses The most appropriate people to direct your questions to would be the people who maintain the trail. They will be able to tell you what the conditions are like, and what the risks are.
