From here there is a seasonal boat to Fredheim at Naustervika, which is connected by road 15 km from Røyrvik, the next opportunity to restock. The distance from Harvasstua to the boat landing appears to be around 55 km. Please be aware that there are no trails, markings, bridges, or shelters along the E1 within the park boundaries. Expect swamps, bushwhacking, and river fording. Do not attempt this route without prior experience in navigating trailless terrain in the Scandinavian mountain wilderness. 

When I'm hiking with my friend, some of the time we hike together, but sometimes we hike seperately, and may be some kilometres apart only to meet on the agreed location for the evening. Our next trip will be in an area with no trails at all, so we need good communication. Therefore, we're looking into getting a pair of walkie-talkies / two-way radio. It appears such are often used for rock climbing, for baby alerts, etc. Those are all applications where both transceivers are less than a few hundred metre apart. We will be further apart. For a set of walkie-talkies small and solid enough to carry on a 2-week hike and costing no more than 100–200€, what is a typical range we can expect? I'd like to hear from actual experiences, rather than manufacturer claims. The area we'll be hiking in has mountains, but is quite open. 

In early summer in the high mountains, snowfields may lie over rivers. These rivers may be otherwise tricky to ford, and it can be very tempting to use the snowfield to cross the river. However, this can, of course, be risky. What is a good way to test whether it is safe to cross? I've heard of using a stick to push the snow, but I wonder if that mightn't collapse the whole snowbridge with me on it... 

There is an interactive map of all (?) E-routes on the website waymarkedtrails. I don't know how reliable it is, but for the sections I've walked in the past it appears accurate. This source suggests that the route is indeed unmarked and that, from north to south, the route is: 

Where do the Mealy Mountains fit in during the ice-free season (August/September)? Are polar bears occasional visitors like in Gros Morne National Park, where it's arguably safe to hike without worrying about polar bears? Or are they closer to being permanently present, and is hiking alone without a guide very dangerous? 

I live in England and I like forests. Where do I find the largest protected forest in England? By protected I mean: no commercial logging (management logging is OK considering no forests without it exist in England), mining, or agriculture. I can tolerate that hunting and fishing are still permitted. I understand the English define ancient woodland as being continuous since before 1600, but for the sake of this question, I do not necessarily insist on it being ancient. 

¹Of course, guide dogs for the blind are always on a very short "leash" (I don't know the correct word), I mean that I haven't seen that the human needed this "leash" to stop the dog from going to other people. 

A mug outside the backpack is far easier to reach. In some areas, you will pass streams very often. During my first ever backpacking trip, with a group of Swedish people hiking Kaisepakte – Pessiskåtan – Lapporten – Tältlägret – Abisko in September 2005, most people had a mug hanging outside so that they could reach it immediately. Every 5 minutes or so, we would cross a stream and people would drink a few draughts. I believe some of them did not bother to carry a water bottle at all, as we were probably never more than 500 metre from a stream during this hike. In fact, Swedish mugs often have a hole specifically for attaching the mug outside the backpack: 

The best thing we can give back is protection against destructive or disruptive actions of our fellow humans (but that is not always realistic). Lobby in your local, regional, national, supernational legislations for the highest level of protection possible for your mountains. Make sure they will not be subject to mining, logging, large-scale infrastructural projects. Get them protected as a strict¹ wilderness. (Note: this answer is not an endorsement for or against vastly extended strict wilderness protection or for or against mining. It is currently not realistic (politically, economically, technically) to strictly protect everything on Earth that anybody may find worth protecting. Sustainability must also take into account short- and long-term human interests. This answer merely points out what any individual can do if he or she wishes to protect the mountains that he or she loves. Of course there are other interests. It is up to the political process to balance those interests and come up with a solution.) 

Hnappadalsá, Lónsöræfi, Iceland, 20 September 2015. This river was difficult to cross, and would have been out of the question without my wading staff. 

According to the Spanish Wikipedia article, the Centro de Visitantes (visitor centre) in El Bosque serves for obtaining authorisation to access de Zona de Reserva: 

Within the outdoor industry, wherever I search, be it on Wild Backpacker, this blog post, etc., it seems a lot of it is focussed on ultralight backpacking. Perhaps that works in sunny Arizona but I tend to hike in bad weather and ultralight is not for me (I want weather protection, I tried ultralight and I have no intention to try again, thank you very much). I don't want ultralight. Is there anything for me in the "cottage industry"? 

Although I have not found IUCN Level II protected areas, there do exist areas with a higher level than national parks. So, for are there at least areas with a protection level stricter than what UK National Parks have?, the answer is yes. Within England, there exist National Nature Reserves. According to Protected Planet, those are protected at IUCN level IV, so one level higher than UK national parks, that are Level V. National Nature Reserves are small areas. The largest is The Wash at 88 km², whereas the smallest is Horn Park Quarry at just 3200 m². 

In the United States, many national monuments are managed by the national park service, but not all. For example, Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah and Upper Missouri River Breaks are both managed by the Bureau of Land Management. From an outdoor recreation point of view, is it relevant who manages a national monument? Does it make any differences? 

The linked guide contains detailed instructions in how to specifically grade a route for each of those. There is also an online application (in Spanish) to calculate MIDE scores. Although the system is Spanish, it would appear that, perhaps with some adaptations, it should be possible to adapt the system world-wide. 

The lake has an elevation of around 300 metre. However, all are very, very far east of the Rocky Mountains, and do therefore unfortunately not meet your requirements (NB: When I reached Litleverifassfossen, it had been 5 days since the last time I saw any humans, as I hiked in from Laponia, but it can also be reached from the nearest road in less a day hiking). 

Is it warmer to sleep in a car or in a tent? Suppose that our old internal-combustion-engine car breaks down in a remote place at -30°C, -40°C, or -50°C, and the engine won't run at all. Suppose we're travelling with a single car, but we did bring full camping gear, including winter sleeping bags and a good double walled dome tent that we can squeeze into together with all passengers. We also have some candles to make heat. It's getting dark and we will spend the night hoping for a passer-by tomorrow. Faced with the choice is sleeping in our broken-down Toyota or in a tent, what would be warmer? We may be able to bury the tent partly below the snow. Assume no wind. See also: My car broke down in Siberia. What do I do now? 

I've recently bought a pair of PMR446 walkie-talkies with some 5–10 km range, operating at 446 MHz. We've happily used them in Sareks Nationalpark in Sweden. Now I'm moving to Canada, where this frequency requires a license. My options are to: 

I have phoned with the trail reservation office for Jasper National Park, and this is what they told me. The route has been decommisioned. This means that it is now considered wildland. Hiking and camping are permitted but require significantly more skills (and some more equipment) than hiking on a well-maintained "semi-primitive" trail. A backcountry permit and fee are still required. One should preferably camp on former campgrounds (as they still suitable places), but random camping is permitted 5 km from the trailhead. The reservation office still registers who are on the trail in what period. So: good news for through-hikers. 

P.S. It amazes me how often I see people in England out in the rain without proper rain protection. This is England, it rains. I don't recall seeing the same in Netherlands, Sweden, or Norway. In the USA too, right on the peak of Mt. Marcy, I remember seeing hikers without any rain gear caught out in heavy rain. A sure way to catch a cold or worse. 

The Swedish tent company Hilleberg has packing lists with masses on their website. Their itemized list includes a lower and upper range for a list of items, leading to a very large range of masses: Their summer list has: 

Photo from Wikipedia, CC-BY-SA 3.0 When on tour in Svalbard (and presumably in other polar bear territory as well), one is required to carry a rifle in order to protect oneself when attacked by a bear. But what about during the night? Must someone stay awake all night to keep guard in case a polar bear comes for human meat? 

Don't, unless you know the route very well and are sure the rivers can pose no danger. Travel the day before so you arrive to the trailhead before it gets dark, then spend the night at the trailhead. Big river crossings at night are too dangerous. A headlight will only do so much as the light will just reflect off the surface. You won't be able to tell the depth of the river. Travelling the afternoon the day before has the added advantage that you will do the river crossings in the afternoon, minimising the risk that swelling river levels trap you on the far side of the river. 

Source: ISOR (available online here). The topographic map does not list hot springs. The tourist map only lists some of them, in particular the ones with tourist infrastructure. But the ones that are deep in the wilderness, tens of kilometres from the nearest frequented road, may only be indicated on the geological map. On the map I have, the hot springs are categorised by temperature, so I know that the boiling ones may be fun to watch but not so fun to bathe in. But imagine being deep in the wilderness, it's 5°C, raining, and windy, and then arriving at a hot spring at 35°C, all for oneself (because no-one else brought a geologic map!). Hmm.....! In a geologically infant area such as Iceland, the age of the land may also be relevant. 1000 year old land is quite different from 100.000 year old land. But that information can be more directly obtained from a vegetation map where available. 

I have experienced this problem, mainly in Spain, Germany, or the Alps. Some things I have found to work: 

"Canal" without name on the map to be crossed. Not difficult, but unavoidable. No flow but it is around waist-deep. This obstacle is less than 30 minutes hiking west of crossing Alep Vássjájågåsj, and as I remember the terrain in-between is easy, so in good weather you could consider keeping your river-crossing footwear on. 

My wife does this with her hiking boots. She finds that it feels more stable and that the flap and knot remain in place better. We first learned about it from a seller at a local outdoor store, who recommended it when she felt the flap wasn't staying in place very well. In practice, a difference is that the knot is lower down, which changes the location where the boot feels most tight. The best way to find out whether it works for you is really to try out both and experience the difference.
