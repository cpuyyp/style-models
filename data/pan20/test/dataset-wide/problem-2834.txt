Firstly, mathematics is circular even in the notion of natural numbers. Worse still, there is not only no viable alternative but also no apparent physical model of Peano Arithmetic. Moreover, the generalized incompleteness theorems can be proven in weak meta-systems such as ACA, which imply that there is absolutely no way to pin down the natural numbers by any useful formal system whatsoever. Hence even if we assume that PA is correct about natural numbers (whatever they are), it is really a strange kind of 'blind faith' because we cannot even mathematically specify what the natural numbers are, and yet we are making assumptions about them! Also, you may be interested in this brief account of the increasing philosophical assumptions needed to express more or prove more. So, yes, all mathematics is based on faith in the sense that there is no valid justification for PA being completely correct about some structure in the real world, and yet formal systems are based on the essentially equivalent string manipulation properties. But, no, PA was originally designed to capture what we thought was correct about what we conceived of as natural numbers, and seems to work at human scales, so is that really 'blind faith'? If it is, how can you explain why RSA decryption works? Secondly, your question about philosophical theories is quite answered by the above considerations regarding formal systems. Let me put it explicitly. Every formal system needs the basic properties of finite strings to hold, otherwise one cannot even affirm that the very notion of logical deduction is valid. But there is no viable substitute for formal systems in rigorous logical reasoning, so any philosophical theory that has objective proof validity already relies on the same circularities as mathematics. And if a philosophical theory does not have objective proof validity, it cannot be claimed to be objective, and is arguably worse than having 'blind faith' in classical arithmetic. The reason is that any claimed proof in classical logic can be checked syntactically and its validity over the deductive system is decidable and unambiguous, so anyone who thinks their semantic interpretation of the axioms are true, then they are forced to accept the semantic truth of the proven conclusions. In contrast, any non-syntactic system is no better than just arbitrary opinions, since there is no precise delineation of valid arguments. 

There's no official definition of the term "fake news." However, it can probably loosely be considered a synonym of "propaganda." You might describe it as a buzzword. But there's a twist: The people who appear to be getting the most mileage out of the term are themselves propagandists. The term first got my attention when Donald Trump started using it. A political scientist or psychologist could have a field day analyzing this little adventure in propaganda. First, most people consider Donald Trump a corrupt political and a liar. By extension, they reason that if Trump accuses a prominent newspaper (e.g. the Washington Post) of dispensing fake news, then the Washington Post must in fact be speaking the truth. Yet the Washington Post (now owned by Jeff Bezos, by the way) is widely reviled by people who are politically astute. What's going on? If we want to approach this scientifically, we might envision three scenarios: 

The circle more or less doubles as a zero, both of which are powerful philosophical symbols.Simpatico further points out that, to the ancients, a circle represented a void. I've been working on a simple diagram that depicts philosophy, science, religion, spirituality, etc. as overlapping spheres. The idea is to indicate their relation to each other and perhaps indicate their origin and/or limitations at the same time. 

Is there a philosophical term for fear of the unknown, other than xenophobia? If such a term doesn't exist, can you think of a philosopher who discussed the phenomenon? EDIT I should probably define "unknown." I'm including things we simply have no knowledge of; for example, what lies beyond the borders of the universe? It could also include questions like what is death, or what's going to happen to me after I die? The unknown could thus include things we are vaguely aware of but which we don't fully understand. 

If you say "no", then you would be saying that God is forced to be omnipotent. If you say "yes", then you would be saying that God can choose to become not omnipotent, in which case there can be free will. Omnipotence and free will Thus the necessary conclusion from the above reasoning is that the standard argument that omnipotence is incompatible with free will is invalid if the above definition of omnipotence is used. If another definition for omnipotence is used, what would it be? Under most alternative definitions, it's no longer important whether God (if he exists) is omnipotent. So far almost all writings on God's omnipotence do not precisely specify what they mean anyway, so their arguments are not well founded. Free will I'll use the definition that "free will" means "ability to choose the future". This of course depends on your definition of "future", but it suffices for our argument later. This is also a very weak kind of free will, but it avoids the problem of defining what choices are involved. This also depends on exactly what "choice" means, which cannot really be defined. I'll just say let's use our intuitive meaning for now. Omniscience 1 If by "omniscience" you mean "knowing the truth value of everything", then of course any omniscient being will know the future of everything. This applies even in the case that you assume that there is one world for every possibility. In any case, existence of an omniscient being implies non-existence of free will in the sense that we cannot choose the future if it is already something that is known by this being. You cannot say that we can make choices that can change this knowledge because by definition an omniscient being knows the final result of all choices. Also, a being that is once omniscient cannot choose to become not omniscient, because while omniscient he already knows everything including when he is not omniscient, unless he also can make himself forget what he knew before. But indeed an omnipotent being can become not omniscient and make himself forget what he knew before, so even if there is a God and there is free will we cannot conclude that this God was never omniscient! Omniscience 2 Another possible definition of "omniscient" is "being able to determine the truth value of any thing". This is strictly weaker than the above definition of "omniscient", for the same reason that mathematical induction does not imply the existence of an infinite collection. An omniscient being of this kind can still be compatible with free will for choices which he does not attempt to determine until they are made. Again, I intend no time connotation here but English forces my grammar. But most people do not even think of such kind of omniscience, not to say believe that their God (if any) is of this sort. Omniscience 3 Some who believe in the existence of a God simply believe that God is omniscient about people in a weaker sense of "knowing what people would do given their choice of virtues". In other words, people have the free will to choose virtues that they desire, but based on those choices their lives are essentially determined. One variant of this is found in the Jewish psalm: 

Judging by some of the discussions I've seen on this and other forums, most modern philosophers are hardly "pragmatic." In the political arena, they tend to be typically plodding thinkers at best, and many are strikingly right-wing. Case in point: I'm a big fan of emotion and revenge (when properly challenged). However, both appear to be dirty words on this forum. 

If you exercise free will in a deterministic universe, you will probably be better off than a person who is apathetic or blindly obedient to the status quo. We might argue that such a person is destined to succeed. If you do NOT exercise free will in a deterministic universe, you are destined to fail. If you exercise free will in a random universe (is that the correct term for non-deterministic universe?), then you CHOSE to succeed. If you do NOT exercise free will in a random universe, then you chose to fail. 

Wyoming once adopted the slogan "Wyoming - Like no place on Earth." It wasn't terribly popular and was soon scrapped. Some people joked, "If it isn't like any place on Earth, then exactly WEHRE is Wyoming?" I couldn't resist asking if this qualifies as some kind of fallacy. (I suspect there are a lot of state nicknames and slogans that ought to be scrutinized for fallacies!) 

An ecologist named Chris Thomas thinks we should give up on trying to save the environment because humans evolved along with other life forms, therefore, all our actions are natural. What notable philosophers or philosophical doctrines would either support or not support this view? (I think we assume the monotheistic religions would support Thomas, but I'm not sure about "eastern religions.") 

The question actually boils down to the question of whether or not there is a single underlying reality. Science assumes that there is, and recognizes that what we observe is merely a shadow of a slice of that underlying reality, since we can only hope to observe a very small part of the whole world, and our observations will not be a perfect representation of the real thing. The laws of nature then refer to the rules governing the underlying reality, not what we observe or the scientific hypotheses that we make. The problem with discarding the assumption that there is an underlying reality is that there is then no consistent worldview. You would have to grant that it is absolutely true that something exists, even if there is nothing you can say about what kind of thing exists. Since the negation (that nothing exists at all) is absolutely false, you can see that the fact that something exists is indeed one aspect of the underlying reality. Since it is rather evident from Science (even if not absolutely provable) that the underlying reality is governed by laws, your question of what enforces the rules themselves is a very astute one. Clearly something must, otherwise there is nothing to bring about the governance in the first place. We must conclude then that the totality of all the laws governing reality must both govern and enforce itself, since anything that governs that totality must be included in it by definition. Note that this totality includes even laws that govern other laws. From this point, the atheist concludes that the world explains or creates itself. In contrast, the theist concludes that there is a conscious lawmaker called God that made and enforces all the laws for certain purposes, who is self-explanatory (such as being called "I will be what I will be" in Abrahamic religions). The only difference is essentially whether the self-explanatory core is conscious (whatever that means). And the agnostic thinks it cannot be known. Note that all have to accept that it is perfectly consistent to have absolutely nothing at all exist, but it is simply a fact that our world does exist. Whichever viewpoint you choose, it would be difficult to imagine just how the laws are enforced, but certainly it is not by computation in the sense that we are familiar with, and so your reason of rejecting the existence of underlying laws is flawed because you assume that something must compute that way. To give an (imperfect) analogy, a machine works in a specific way because its parts and programming forces it to work that way. If you did not see those constituents, it does not change the fact that it is governed by them, and in fact you can often infer not only the existence but the nature of those constituents to a certain extent just by observing the way the machine works. This is science. The difference is that there is some fundamental part of reality which governs itself, which science may never reach, and that is part of the next point. The observations that we can make in our world may not be able to probe much of reality. This is almost certainly true if we use only scientific experiments, because experiments are incapable of distinguishing between many different hypotheses that are consistent with all the observations but contradict each other. This problem cannot be eliminated because there are infinitely many hypotheses that can 'explain' everything we have observed but differ in places we have not or cannot observe. For example, you could have been constructed by some laws just one second ago and implanted with memories that make it seem as if you have existed for much longer. It is consistent, but no experiment can refute it. This is where we need logic and philosophy to guide our hypotheses and so we choose the simplest ones that explain all our current knowledge. It is highly likely (and history has repeatedly confirmed) that the underlying reality will always be more complicated than the simplest model we construct for our current knowledge, but that does not mean that we give up and do not construct any model at all just because we will never get it. We make models of the world with the main purpose of being able to predict roughly how the world will behave in the future, so that we can take appropriate actions now. For instance, we give food and water to people who depend on us because we predict that they require food and water to live. And so far, at least this necessity of nourishment seems to coincide with the underlying reality! 

I think your question is a little broad and can be viewed from different perspectives. Keep in mind that telling the truth, lying and maintaining silence can all have consequences, and those consequences may be good or bad, depending on the circumstances. One could easily imagine situations where telling a lie would be better than silence - unless one is subscribes to the idea that lying is always immoral, period. Consider, also, "lies of omission," a phrase roughly synonymous with silence. To put this one in perspective, consider the corporate media, which lie 24/7. At the same time, they often ignore real events and people (silence/lies of omission). For example, a protest against racism or U.S. foreign policy may be completely snubbed by the media. And if you're a political activist or candidate for public office, you probably know what it's like to be virtually invisible in the media, which are too busy promoting phony activists. From that perspective, I don't see a huge difference between lying and silence. But there are many situations outside the political arena that may be different, as well as many different perspectives and schools of thought. 

I just learned about Sheldon Kopp on this forum, and I love his list of "eternal truths." Of course, I don't yet understand all of them, including this one: 

I've been very "philosophical" all my life, but I didn't start studying philosophy until I was about sixty-two. Actually, I took Philosophy 101 in college, but I remember nothing about it except that it was a very dull, meaningless course taught by a dull, meaningless instructor. There are a couple things I really like about philosophy. First, many people see the world in black-and-white. As a "liberal" (loosely speaking), I have long prided myself on being able to see shades of gray. But philosophy takes us even farther. Instead of asking if God exists (Yes or No), a philosopher might ask, "What do you mean by 'God'?" That example also illustrates the second thing I like about philosophy. It forces us to pay attention to the meaning of words, something that's especially important in the realm of political science. In fact, I think philosophy should be studied by anyone who wants to understand mind control, because, believe it or not, there's a lot of propaganda in philosophy. With this in mind, philosophy is a lot like history. Most of what we know about ancient Greece was written by ancient Greeks, and only a fool would believe they were completely honest in their description of their culture. On top of that, philosophy can be really complex and wordy, as you noted. My free advice to a novice student of philosophy is DON'T DIVE HEADFIRST INTO PLATO, MACHIAVELLI OR ANY OTHER PHILOSOPHER. A better strategy (in my opinion) is to get on the Internet and start watching philosophy videos, focusing especially on videos that focus on the big picture. I'm talking about things like the origin of philosophy, the history of philosophy, the most famous philosophers. Try to get a grasp on the major philosophical schools, questions and ideas. Watching a 15-minute video is a helluva lot more enjoyable than trying to wade through a vast manuscript written by an ancient Greek. After watching a few videos and reading a few (hopefully interesting, if not enjoyable) articles, you should have a basic roadmap in your head. Now you can pursue a specific interest, diving headfirst into Plato, if you want. But you're still going to have to read Plato several times before you really get it. And I'll be upfront in saying that I haven't yet explored Plato's works in any depth. Instead, I've simply focused on what's been written about Plato. My response was a bit rambling and wordy, but was it worse than Plato? ;) 

There is a significant philosophical problem with the common viewpoint of many set theorists. Namely, the notion of "set" was supposed to capture the notion of "collection". If really there is some set-theoretic universe that satisfies ZFC, then that universe itself is a collection, and clearly the ZFC axioms do not correctly capture that. MK (Morse Kelley) set theory does not solve that, because again there is no class of all classes. In any case, there is no non-circular philosophical justification for ZFC, so ZFC is in fact a red-herring in discussing Russell's paradox. Discarding axioms on reaching contradiction Finally, I want to point out that it is not viable to simply discard axioms that lead to contradiction. For a simple example, if PA is consistent then PA+¬Con(PA) is also consistent, but proves a false sentence (under the standard interpretation of natural numbers in the real-world). This clearly shows that mere consistency is nowhere near enough to make a logic or formal system meaningful, and we must have some kind of soundness. At the least, we ought to have arithmetical soundness (at least at human scales). 

I would say that you partly got it, but not very clearly, so let me explain. Firstly, there is a valid objection against the liar paradox that it is not a valid definition. Logically, one cannot refer to something that one has not defined. In this case, any variant of the liar paradox that uses "this sentence" is referring to something that has not yet been defined! This is equivalent to the following nonsense: 

Your friend is depressed. He has another kind of mental/psychiatric problem. He just says he wants to die; he doesn't really mean it. 

This is a very important concept in the political arena. In fact, politics, in the broad sense of term, can almost be defined as the art of acquiring and using power. The maxim "power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely" appears to be very accurate in the "real world." Yet it is possible for very powerful people to be "good." Three very important things to add to the discussion are ethics, group membership and balance. ETHICS: Immoral or amoral people who are very powerful are more likely to manifest behavior most people would describe as bad. GROUP MEMBERSHIP: The Roman empire treated Romans better than the peoples who were conquered by Rome. Roman aristocrats were treated better than common Roman citizens, and the emperor typically treated his relatives better than other people. BALANCE: The term "absolute power" suggests a lack of checks and balances. In fact, most people are limited to some extent by laws, peer pressure, etc. If the laws or peers are themselves corrupt, then a power broker is more likely to be corrupt. When an entire socio-political system is unbalanced, one might expect an increase in government power and corruption. Examples include the latter stages of the Roman empire as well as the United States today. This may not directly answer your question, but it hopefully helps put things in perspective. Keep in mind, also, that power can be used for good. Parents use their power to protect their children, and leaders may marshal powerful military forces to protect their people from invaders. In summary, power isn't good or evil. It's something that can be used in a positive or negative way depending on a number of variables.
