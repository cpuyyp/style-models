I recently quit from my first job out of college. I been there nearly a decade. I do miss the place and sometimes feel a bit of "emptiness" when I think back on it. I miss the people and the place a little. Then I think about why I quit there. I think about the things I do dislike and realize I made a wise choice. I think when you depart, you sort of only remember the good things. That's natural to do. I remember a lot of good things about my previous employer. But then I remember the bad things that made me want to leave and I know I made a wise choice for the better. I recall a research done. I looked up information like you did on quitting and I recall reading a research that some folks talk really, really bad about their employer and quit on those grounds. Then shortly after they realize they made a terrible mistake and the last job was actually really good. I think what these research fail to see is that people quit a job to a new job without researching the new job. They just jumped on the chance for a new job since they were angry with their current employer. I would say so long as you don't do that, you should be okay. The feeling generally goes away after a few months or so, at least for me. 

The worst they can say is no. However you can predict what their answer will be based on several factors. For one, and probably most importantly, if they still have a position open. And secondly, going to largely depend on how you left the company. If you put in your two weeks, and left on good notice, then it's going to come down really to whether or not they have a position open. When you quit a job, always make sure you don't burn any bridges. That means giving them a two weeks notice, and never telling them that you dislike them or anything. However, for future employers don't tell them that you were "frustrated" with your last job. Instead, just say you left to pursue new opportunities. Remember, don't ever say anything bad about your last company. 

The problem is: company B who already made me an offer wants me to act fast and resign from my current position before end of Decembre. Company C has my second interview scheduled for mid January with no way to do that earlier (I already asked). What options do I have? What is the best strategy to achieve the goals I described above? Both positions B and C are equally interesting for me. Keeping my current position (A) is not my preferable solution except they make a far better offer than B and C (note that I dont even know conditions of C) which I honestly do not expect, especially since offer B is already very good and I expect offer C to be at least equally to B or even better. 

Nope. You are not paid to get work done. Unless you have a contract which says you are getting paid only if you perform work x to amount y. What you are paid for is to get work done, when there is work to be done. In your case, there is currently no work to do, and even if your supervisor confirms this - enjoy the quiet times! You can for example use it for developing your work relevant skills by reading related stuff in the internet. But ask your boss first. 

Absolutely no problem here. If you really like to be abroad without changing the (official) place you live, try International Software Consulting or even Sales. In these jobs you will be constantly on the road and live mostly in hotels. If you like to write code, I recommend working as SW Engineer for a company with international facilities, e.g. big manufacturers with facilities in different countries and try to get a position as an Expatriate. Also, there are SW companies who are doing long-term projects for customers all over the world, but I would go for Expatriate if I would like to stay more than a year abroad. 

I honestly don't think it is relevant to list Undergrad degrees when you have a master. I would just list the masters. The part about you pursuing a phd is quite important because it would tell a employer that you plan to pursue it and potentially limit your work schedule and/or work at different hours. 

Maybe some things aren't meant to be a "learning" opportunity. Rather it is what it is and there is nothing to be "learned" from it. It sounds like your manager is telling you to take the "chillax" approach to things. So the IT department can't handle your request. That sounds great. Just tell that to whoever requested it. Just say, "Hey, I just submitted something to IT and they're saying I have to give a reason to fit the goal of the company. Here's what I said..." Then just chillax. Your part of it is done. I would say bureaucratic nonsense is hardly a "learning experience" because everywhere is different. I suppose you could "learn" something by it. First, don't expect anything immediately and think of it like oiling a really jammed up gear. Just slowly drip oil in it, and eventually it'll loosen up. Might take a long time, sure, but the most important thing is not to get frustrated by it. Just slowly keep at it, and slowly things will start moving. It sounds like your boss is cluing you in that things aren't suppose to move fast just yet so you shouldn't worry too much. He didn't say you were doing a bad job, just complaining about it too much because you want things done too soon when it isn't suppose to. 

Firstly, never take any criticism in workplace personally. Just say you understood your mistakes and will learn from them, and nothing more. Obviously, your project manager is not acting professionally by doing things like these. And if the project manager is acting in a negative manner, this negative manner will also be the general attitude of the project team. This is why they say, project managers should have good interpersonal skills. Yours does not have and you and the whole team is suffering because of this. What can you do? Talk with the project manager about your problems in a face-to-face-meeting. Secondly, one hour+ home-workplace-distance is long. Consider moving to nearer to the company if you want to stay there. Also, try to get a position in another department oder team within the company if you really want to stay there. However, as a SE, even a junior one, you should not have any problems finding another job at another company. Start looking for that and finish these last two months of internship, with at least friction as possible. It will rise your chances to find a job at another company or another department. Do not resign, talk with your project manager first. If he does not listen to you, escalate the problem to his/her supervisor. 

Why waste storage space by having an Integer variable for this purpose? Use a boolean instead - IsMale: true or false. Null valie if neither male nor female. Problem solved.
