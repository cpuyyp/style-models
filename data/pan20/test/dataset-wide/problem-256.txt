Traditionally when you see monsters working together in fiction, be it games, film or book, the binding force on a group of monsters is Power. The biggest, strongest, most cunning or most intelligent (usually a combo of those factors) runs things by keeping the others in line with physical force, deceit, or promises of power and wealth. 

As a side note the Divergent series may give you a few ideas. Its not quite as open ended as the system you are describing but it is in the same vein. 

Not having these things leads to problems. For hygiene the obvious problem becomes disease. Disease is still a limiting factor today (less so in the first world perhaps). Medieval medicine could not cope with an epidemic beyond isolating the infected parties. Organizational inefficiency. The Romans, particularly early on, were crazy well organized and it served them very very well...that sort of trailed off but I am not sure whether that was a cause or symptom of the decline of Rome. When organizations get to the empire size, particularly in medieval times things will be disorganized and efficiency and responsiveness to problems suffer drastically. No refrigeration, no long distance food shipments...at least not on the scale you would need to get much larger. Literacy...this sorta goes with organizational efficiency. Literacy makes people more efficient, it improves the flow of information drastically. And accurate information is priceless when trying to manage a large group/organization/empire. 

Twitter. (Or Facebook, or other similar vector.) What you need is the "share" or "retweet" concept, a button that a reader uses to put your post in front of his readers, whose readers have a button... this is how Internet phenomena start. There are no guarantees; lots of interesting, legitimate posts never go anywhere and lots of dreck spreads like wildfire. But if it's something important to enough people, like a cure for cancer or the discovery of a new planet or something that'll take down the top management of a major company, it'll spread, be criticized, be endorsed, be praised, be scoffed at, be investigated... and that's on the first day. You'll also need a place to post a long-form article -- a blog, a publication that's ready to report on your work, etc. Your tweet (or Facebook post or whatever) is the short description with a catchy title/lede and a link. The link target is where you explain your research results in detail. It'll be a rough ride, but you should enable comments there. 

Final Notes No matter which system you choose you will also have to include an enforcement force. Secret Police or something similar that enforce the rules on those that don't want to comply. You have to have workers producing the chemicals, agents dispersing it in whatever manner you choose, chemists in the general population, and off-worlders that stir up ideas. A large propaganda and suppression regime would have to be in place for this to fly. Without all that my suspension of disbelief would be stretched to breaking if EVERYONE just accepted that this was ok, even if it was "secret". 

Additionally you need a transfer medium for your information. I would suggest some form of electro-chemical transmission, ants already use chemical trails to mark paths and others to announce intruders...but those aren't real precise...sapience is going to require more precision. In nature, energy efficiency is paramount. The more complicated the creature the less energy efficient it becomes. Complex organs and systems require far more upkeep and energy. They just happen to offset the energy requirement by increasing the creature's survivability. Size is an issue here...any organ(s) is going to require energy to maintain it and keep it functioning...can an ant maintain the level of energy required to support such a communication method? So. To wrap up you need to. 

There is a line of "reasoning" I sometimes hear from people in the SCA: "well they had indigo dye, and they had french seams, and they had pants, so blue jeans are totally period!" Well, yes and no. So too with modern music forms. Yes you can trace some elements back -- they had drums in the middle ages, and recited poetry with instrumental accompaniment, and certain musical forms like isorhythmic motets were all about rhythmic presentation, and you can squint and tilt your head sideways and say "sounds like rap". But a musical style develops in a context, so you would need to find some reason in your world for these particular events to come together in this particular way to produce a given result. What problem is solved by blue jeans? What development is facilitated by rap? Can you find that need within your world? One path you could take: not everybody is skilled with musical instruments, and not all of them can play drums either (trust me...), but rhythmic accompaniment is a lower bar to entry than the lyre or the lute. So you could imagine a setting in which a drum-accompanied alternative to the lyre-accompanied poems arises, because that's what people in that small village know how to do. From there, you might find the texts evolving, perhaps to emphasize simple rhythms better. Throw all that into the pot for a while and you can see how something kind of like rap could emerge. Or you could start from the aforementioned isorhythmic motets and start simplifying the melodies and reduce them from 2-3 parts down to one to accommodate the skill of the singers you have, and then go from there. But it will only be believable if it arises from within your world, not if it is retrojected into it. (By the way, medieval and renaissance music is one of my hobbies.) 

Or skin stores water and fat and other metabolic products. What happens when we make our skin bullet-proof? Well it sort of depends on how you want to do that. You can either make the skin more dense, make it thicker, or since you want to stop bullets, likely a combination of the two. Thicker, denser skin will make temperature regulation a challenge. Either your rock men should live in a colder climate, that is less prone to temperature swings or you are going to have to hand-wave this. Alternatively you could alter the method of heat reduction, dogs as the obvious example pant to reduce their body temperature. This may still require a bit of hand-waving, I am not sure but I would hazard a guess that panting becomes less effective/efficient as the size of the animal increases. When you increase the density and thickness of a substance you make it stronger but you also make it more inflexible. Odds are these humanoids of yours are not going to be as agile as a regular human. Conversely they will likely be stronger. As one other post mentioned they are going to need to be stronger to support the additional weight of their armored skin. The additional weight reduces their agility as well...momentum and all that. I suppose this would also lead to reduced touch sensitivity, which considering the skin is much tougher isn't a huge problem in a lot of ways. It would be a problem when it comes to fine motor skills and you are probably going to want to make the skin thinner where need be to account for that. On a side note, facial expressions are going to be pretty drastically subdued if they exist at all, its tough to emote if your skin doesn't want to move. As far as the point on storage goes I don't see any problems in the cross over. If anything you would probably want to make this system more robust as getting hit in un-padded armor will still hurt pretty bad. Final notes: Keep in mind that if this evolved via natural means you won't have uniform thickness. Having the core and perhaps upper legs and arms armored would provide protection and help maintain agility, plus the resources to armor everything are biologically expensive...best survival wins. When it comes to survival really tough skin is good, but so is mobility. Rhinos and Elephants have super thick skin sure...but they also don't have fingers. Maintaining a decent level of mobility is going to be important for your humanoids, if you want them to in fact be humanoid. As someone else mentioned you can have hair if you want to, it doesn't technically grow through the skin, but out of little holes. 

We know that something similar happens in mammals; a mother who is infected, or drug-addicted, can transmit that condition to her fetus. So, what we need is a way for a jellyfish-borne virus to affect a pregnant cat. 

Judaism already has a significant focus on land. The whole point of the exodus from Egyptian slavery was to receive the torah (law) and then go to the promised land. God's promise to Avraham was progeny and land. The torah has commandments about tithing crops, leaving the corners of your field for the poor to glean, giving the land every seventh year off... and also commandments about how to conquer and occupy the land. Land and agriculture are already pretty important, in other words. So if you wanted an Abrahamic-style religion that's centered on farming, you could nudge this one in that direction. For example: 

Inventions: Ironically we don't really need any new tech to make this feasible. As mentioned it is still going to be more difficult/expensive but with modern technology we can certainly create a stable effective underground dwelling. 

Short of the great potential for a bureaucratic nightmare, this seems like a good plan to me. The tough part of this plan would be getting it passed. When you start talking about interfering in families like this many people will fight it. But given that you get the law in place your plan appears pretty solid though obviously there are concerns (as with any plan) Concerns: 

Magic is simply energy right? So long as the systems meet your needs and aren't ridiculous in and of themselves I have no trouble with the concept of multiple systems in one world. What you really need to define are the sources of the energy, the limits of each source and how a user accesses that energy. In the physical world we have many forms of energy. We have fossil fuels, solar, hydro, wind, geothermal, chemical and probably other forms of energy. Suggesting a magic system with multiple power sources really doesn't strain suspension of disbelief any more than having magic in the first place. So again. Define the following: Source: Where does the power come from. In your case there is 

Squinting. I'm not joking. I'm a light-sensitive human (so way less light-sensitive than your outworlder), and even I go through a lot of life shielding my eyes and/or squinting, especially outdoors. It's usually involuntary. Your outworlders will also have a preference for lower light levels; they can't do much about the school, but in their homes they'd use lower-lumen lighting than normal. (Assume they use lighting at all because the neighbors might drop in.) They might also seek out special eyeglasses, whether that means tinted (like some albinos in our world wear) or made of materials with different refractive properties. They'll wear sunglasses wherever possible, sometimes even when others around them aren't. They'll be particularly sensitive to large reflective surfaces like expanses of fresh-fallen snow. 

You ask how many children to allow by law, but you also say you want a "completely constant" population. These conflict; a rate set by law will get you an approximately steady population, but people die, some people don't have kids, some people live a really long time... so your population will vary. For a strict steady rate, then, you need something other than family-size laws. Hugh Howey's Silo books show a way to mandate a constant population -- though be warned that it comes at the cost of some personal liberties. In his world, what remains of humanity is living in an underground structure (the "silo"), with carefully-balanced food production, living space, waste management, air, etc. And the rule is: when somebody dies, a lottery is held to choose the next couple to produce a child. They get some amount of time in which to try, and if they don't succeed, somebody else gets a try. This is enforced by a mandatory contraceptive device that is implanted at puberty and suppressed somehow for couples that are allowed to be fertile. If you want a completely constant population, you need to regulate births directly. I don't know how large your island is or how many people will be living there, but if it's large you can subdivide the group for purposes of population control. Note that since you control who's allowed to have children at all, you can also apply whatever controls you need to prevent inbreeding, inherited diseases, etc. You get to decide who's allowed to enter the lottery, in other words. 

One correction to your question and that is that among lions the females, not the males do most of the hunting. The males tend to patrol the pride lands and keep other threats at bay. (Probably just a typo from reading your post) To answer you questions though. There are two primary reasons why you would have a fox with nine tails. 

We as humans view humans as very diverse. We vary wildly in terms culture, society, intelligence, color, gender, language, architecture, literature, weapons...I could go on but you see my point. All that said there are certain things that unite us. We are all bi-pedal, we breathe the same air, heck, we share something like 99.5% identical DNA. Now if we look back at our own history how did (as an overused example) Europeans treat the indigenous cultures they met? They were treated as "them" and the Europeans as "us". If you go back even further you could get to the point where people a day's walk from one another would have viewed each other as "not us" and when you view people in such a way it is very simple to utilize a working assumption that they are all the same. 

Therefore a werewolf's best meals will come by the light of the full moon -- and on that night a werewolf could be satiated for a month. (It'll still eat in human form, for both biological and social reasons. But the big, glorious feast comes once a month.) A werewolf could turn at other times, but it's not worth it -- turning takes a lot out of the werewolf physically; he needs a few days to recover enough to do it again. To one who can see into the UV spectrum, though, the full moon really lights up the night sky. (Source: personal experience.) So a werewolf will restrain himself as the moon waxes full, holding it until the right night, and then go for it. The moon doesn't turn werewolves; the moon is the cue. 

Upon walking into the cave you would see this (below): A 25 foot tall stone wall nestled into a narrow point in a large cavern. 

Situations like this are possible but would likely be short lived temporary solutions if everything else is earth-like. Now if you note that that the world is different in some way resource wise, that could be realistic long term. For example, maybe there are no fossil fuels left and motorized transport on a global scale is not supportable. 

I have in my world a "crystalline desert". The idea is that a major cataclysmic event turned the surrounding area into glass, color irrelevant. Then following the event, major earthquakes and the passage of time broke it up into much smaller pieces, at least on the surface. There could be major chunks of "glass" below the surface I suppose. The end result is a desert made predominantly of little tiny glass shards (I suppose they would turn into beads over time). edit: I will add that when I say glass I mean a solid shiny surface, so glass like in appearance, it doesn't have to be chemically identical to glass edit2: Occurred to me I should mention that the area in question is quite large. Say the size of Texas but circular. 268,581 sq/miles. It can be 'more' glassy in the middle and only partially towards the edges. edit3: I want to clarify that I do not require an event. The event will be magical in nature, but that doesn't mean that a hellish firestorm couldn't cause problem globally.
