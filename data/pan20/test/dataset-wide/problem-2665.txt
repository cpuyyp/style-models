An evolutionary biologist would deny that life, categorically, is trying to do anything, something which implies a will and a clear intention (here, survival). Things exist because they exist in such a way that they happen to survive. And in biology, it's the survival of species, not individuals per se, that is generally of interest (although the definition of species is tricky, with at least 20 known definitions in the biological literature). I would never argue that things, least of all bacteria, are trying to survive. They just happen to. But since this is a philosophical discussion, I will point you to a classical definition given by Aristotle which is, briefly, that which possess in itself the cause of its own motion (or change). You grow and move your arms because of causes inside you, while the changes which occur in a river, a rock or any other non-living thing can only be attributed to causes outside itself. Aristotle also held to finality which explained this internal cause, and the reasons for the observed changes. 

(1) doesn't solve anything because it slips common notions of the good in through the back door. (2) opens up a Pandora's box of problems and consequences, some of which undermine Harris's other positions (e.g. biology doesn't prevent organisms, including humans, to evolve which experience pleasure/pain differently; if all activity, including science, becomes motivated only by pleasure, then why should the truth necessarily matter?; the questionable formulation of the common good and its raison d'être; and so on). I wouldn't spend too much time on Harris's work. He's poorly versed in philosophy, and consequently philosophers don't take him very seriously (if I recall correctly, even Dennett once expressed serious reservations about Harris's competence in this area). 

I don't see why you think there is any reason to respond. In metaphysics, when one says something is prior to something else, we mean prior in the causal order. The question isn't "what came before the universe in time?", only what caused the universe. Causality is not the same as succession in time. The North Pole analogy as a strategy to render meaningless causal questions by invoking temporal notions of cause is nothing short of a profound misunderstanding of causality. 

engaging in a bit of circular reasoning when he uses what is effectively a synonym for good ("well-being") to define good, or he is essentially grounding morality in what amounts to hedonism (which Dawkins more or less admits when he says that Harris bases his entire proposal on the removal of suffering). 

Perhaps of some general use, in addition to the above mentioned philosophers, is Aristotle's treatment most notably in his De Anima. He distinguishes between creatures which possess no memory and which react to images (in modern parlance, we might understand image as a kind of synthetic "stimulus" resulting from the combination of the stimuli of individual senses), and cease to react as soon as the image fades. This kind of response to image is not dependent on memory. The question of whether a self exists apart from memory depends of course on what is meant by self (spotaneous, not instantaneous, is the word you're looking for) and what you mean by memory. Is self what some psychoanalysts or Buddhists might call an ego or false self, a social construct? Is the self the individuated substance of the subject, one which can be actualized? What is self in relation to intellect and memory? What is the psyche? Back to the Stagirite: the first book of the Metaphysics talks about experience as a function of memory. If a person has absolutely no memory of ANY kind that extends beyond 30 seconds, then clearly things involving experience, e.g. language, art, science, become nearly impossible especially if we assume that experience requires the memories that produced it to persist (the self here is understood as the soul whose existence, of course, does not depend on experience, but precedes experiences and is actualized through experience). 

I think you have to be careful with metaphors. Very careful. Some writers get carried away with their ideas and comparisons and end up committing the error of treating metaphors as if they had formal import per se. This question is, of course, metaphysical at bottom. For example, one metaphysical position may render the distinction between things is ultimately illusory, further rendering the existence of organisms illusory, at least as we understand them. Some metaphysical positions subordinate individuals to the societies they produce. However, an Aristotelian metaphysics quite clearly places organisms above the societies they create. Here, individual organisms are defined through a final cause -- an end -- which they seek to realize and actualize. Some of those organisms realize their ends through interaction with other organisms of the same species, forming societies and communities among themselves in order to realize their natures, as it were. Societies are not individual in themselves but a multiplicity of individuals united in varying relations and subordinate metaphysically to the individuals participating in these relations. The opposite is true when we consider parts of an organism where the parts of an organism are subordinate to the organism of the whole and ordered according to the finality of the organism. In this sense, you cannot speak of superorganisms despite very superficial similarities between the coordination between an organism's parts and cooperation between individuals. There is no being called "society" which has an end in itself, only a community of individuals which is instrumental in relation to the ends of its members. 

The nonexistence of something can be proven if by proven we mean logically deduced, or if mean that it cannot be conceived. We can, for instance, prove that a particular kind of thing cannot exist if, given a set of properties, we show that they lead, taken together, to a contradiction e.g. a square circle. Some proofs for the nonexistence of God, for instance, are proofs for the nonexistence of a particular kind or conception of God. Now as far as a negative claim having a burden of proof: of course it does, because the "negativeness" of the claim is not in the making-of-a-claim (you can only make "positive" claims, that is, about a state of affairs being such and such, making it a redundant adjective). For instance, when someone makes any claim, they face a burden of proof. The popular example today among armchair intellectuals is the existence of God. In this context, some claim that they don't need to prove the nonexistence of God in order to make the claim that God doesn't exist. This is wrong. They can claim that they don't see any reason to believe in God or that they don't find the proofs convincing without burden of proof, but to claim God does not exist is logically equivalent to making a claim about a state of affairs in which God is not only unnecessary but necessarily absent. In other words, a proof of nonexistence must show that a thing cannot exist. Empirical claims of nonexistence are merely special cases constrained by time and space. 

I'm going to use the term metaphysics because while ontology is used as a synonym, some distinguish the former from the latter quite sharply (something along the lines of the study of being itself vs. mere conceptual analysis). Your distinction between change and being is a bit of a false one, I think, and you yourself propose the study of change, of something as if it were a something on its own without reference to anything else. The answer is metaphysics by virtue of the fact that change occurs in beings. Historically, there was a debate between Parmenides and Heraclitus about exactly being and change; the former concluded that only being exists (think Zeno and his proofs of the non-existence of motion, otherwise known as change) while the latter concluded that only change exists ("you can't step in the same river twice", leaving the world essentially unintelligible). The former flies in the face of our experience: things do change. On the other hand, the latter is absurd if we admit the existence of things at all: it's not that you can't step in the same river twice, Heraclitus, it's that you can't step in the same river once, because even while you take your step, the river changes...as does your foot. Aristotle's solution, which sought to reconcile being with change, was to define change, briefly, as the transition from potency to act and act to potency. So while the river changes, as does your foot, it is the river that changes, and it is your foot that changes. The change is only accidental, and not substantial, in this case. Changes in substance are still changes in something. 

I'm not certain the preface paradox, as stated, holds water. Why? Because we ignore that our psychological constitutions do not dwell in some eternal world. Indeed, we think and perceive in time. Take, for instance, the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance. Now when an author writes his book, he may in fact experience certainty about the quality of his work. He may, when writing the preface, either out of institutionalized modesty or a genuine onset of doubt, come to experience a reduced certainty of the quality of his work. In fact, Łukasiewicz, in his book on the principle of contradiction, points out that Aristotle suggests three such principles in his work, one of then psychological, one which amounts to the assertion that one cannot hold two contradictory beliefs simultaneously. If that is the case, then one must ask whether what appears to be a contradiction to an observer is reconciled in some "hidden" way. 

why do human beings experience existential angst? what is the relationship between computer and human being? is consciousness necessary to have an encounter with existential questions? can computers experience existential angst or at least run into existential questions? can computers be conscious? what is the relationship between reason/understanding and consciousness? 

Your question depends on three ingredients: a sound definition of consciousness, a sound philosophical anthropology, and a sound definition of "computer". Given those, one can begin answering questions such as 

The subject of teleology is given significant treatment in a number of books, including Etienne Gilson's "From Aristotle to Darwin and Back Again: A Journey in Final Causality, Species and Evolution". It's too big a question for a post IMO. 

These aren't easy questions, and neither is yours, IMO. And since this is an interdisciplinary question, one would need to reconcile the various languages used in each domain. My cursory answer flow from some of my positions or tendencies of which I am aware. I avoid the common tendency to anthropomorphize computers or the wild and presumptuous oversimplifications of reductionism. One source of this angst may be the awareness of one's radical freedom. Another source may be the futility of one's actions as death renders one and everything naught. In the case of freedom, if we accept that humans beings are free or capable of being free, it is clear that computers are not free in this sense, as they are fully deterministic machines able only to do what they are programmed to do, whether directly or indirectly. Their actions are rooted not in a finality of their own, but the finality of their human creators and programmers. In another sense, they are free as long as they are not impeded in executing instructions, but this is not the kind of freedom human beings experience. In second case (the futility of all action), this again cannot escape teleology if it is to make rational sense. A futile action is one which brings no (lasting) benefit, which itself requires that some desire be the motive force. Computers do not desire; they only execute instructions. Since computers remain idle without instructions put into it, then their nature is to execute instructions which precludes autonomousness. One can program a computer to perform certain actions once certain conditions are met, but I am far from convinced that the lead from computer to human being can be so easily made. It has also never been shown that a computer can reason. Now since a computer does not desire, it follows that even if a computer could come to hold some representation of such a preposition that could produce a condition wherein the categorical futility of action could alter the course of instructions, in the best case it would only cease to act. But a computer must be first programmed in such a way that it would act on such a preposition in such a way that it would cease acting i.e. executing instructions (we could equally program it to play chess). The meaning of such prepositions is lost on the computer. It does not act by virtue of the meaning, but by virtue of the programming. Enter consciousness. Does consciousness entail autonomy, understanding, meaning or reason? That's affording a computer quite a bit, and its not all that clear what they could mean or how they could exist outside of the human context. Regardless, one must ask "what could a computer be conscious of?" and "how is it relevant to this problem?".
