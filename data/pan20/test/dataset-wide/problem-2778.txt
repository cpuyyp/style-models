The reason math has to be a priori is that we assume that all humans will agree ultimately upon the same mathematical truths. This is not true of any other domain. We presume that our physics is moderated by our experience, but not our math. Equally competent and intelligent physicists of every generation have disagreed, even with access to the same data. Likewise for biology, ethics, law, etc. But mathematicians, once given proofs, expect not to disagree. If there is no consensus, we must presume the flaw is in the proof -- it is in some way incomplete. So the truth value is set outside the individual, irrelevant of experience. It may not yet be 'synthesized' by exposure to the stimuli that make it relevant. But it is already formed, or it would ultimately vary between individuals. A materialist way of framing a priori thought would be that it is at least phylogenetic: All humans agree on it, and once they form the concepts, it never changes for them. We cannot know whether non-humans would, but by this argument Kant suggests that they will do so, unless their perception of space and time is entirely different, sharing no common basis with our own. 

Since it is somehow OK to attack me as if I were Locke, when I speak from a traditional interpretation of Locke, I will give a more personal answer, contrary to the stated policy of the site. In my own mind Sartre leads back to Kant via Transpersonal Psychology. The question of whether to obey the law involves a direct conflict between two layers of an individual's identity. One is most primarily one's conscious, autonomous self, preserving the sense of identity and independence that allows for day-to-day decision making. But humans are social animals and one is also a member of concentric rings of group identity. Each of these layers comes with its own expectations and its own moral pressures. I have my religious history, my identity in terms of my race, class, sexual orientation, and other subcultures in which I take part. I have my nuclear family standards, and my extended family standards. I have my nationality, and my family tradition of nationalities, including the pattern of assimilation from past nationalities into my current one. This goes on and on. From an Existentialist POV, how to manage the accumulated moral pastiche is a challenge to my authenticity. I cannot be the perfect version of each of these competing selves, and if I were the 'perfect' version of any of them, I would be simply reducing myself, within the context of the games that maintain those processes, into a non-player character who does not contribute anything by being there. Virtual nonexistence on many levels is not problematic. There are so many potential contexts that being oblivious to most of them and complying completely within most of those of the remainder is an automatic consequence. But virtual nonexistence on every level defies the authentic need to be an individual. One of these layers is he meta-national construct of liberal democracy. Liberal democracies themselves are very consciously constructed from the theory of the social contract. So a chosen position toward that theory is necessary if one wishes to maintain a position within the context of any modern State. If you reject the position entirely, you need to analyze whether the benefits that are conferred on you by the state can be authentically accepted, or whether being where you were raised requires of you unproductive denial or degrading manipulation. If you choose to accept the State as it is, you cannot reasonably dismiss this theory. You do not need to participate in it from a position of actual faith or belief, but you need to accept it on its own terms. The theory itself does not dictate that you are bound directly by the laws of the State. Instead, it requires that you judge the laws of the State, and that you respond to them honestly as if negotiating a contract that would bind everyone in your position. Your position is always entirely unique, so this is not necessarily something like a Kantian universalization. But the negotiation process that you undertake with these expectations needs to be, again, authentic. It needs to maintain your identity and not abuse it. To the degree you want to be a special case, that position must not require you to live out a fantasy that detaches you from responsibilities the weight of which you do, in fact, feel. Decisions to break the law are direct conflicts between the conscious individual self and this expected negotiation process imposed by the structure of the modern state. We do in fact accommodate ourselves to the history of decisions we make, so the only real rule is "don't pretend, unless you are willing to have the act become a reality for you." That is a lot of work. So complete compliance with the notion of the social contract, even though it is a known fiction, is simply the only way of remaining sane most of the time. But obviously, when it contends directly with levels of the persona closer to its core, the more personal autheticity wins unless a meaningful compromise can be struck. (I have defied sodomy and drug laws quite liberally, because those challenge more personal layers of my identity that I cannot compromise while retaining an authentic relationship to the intersection of my gender, my sexual orientation and my social class, and the culture that has grown up around it. If the punishments assigned were in fact applied, I would not simply accept them, I would consider myself abused. Public health is the kind of thing a liberal democracy tries to regulate, but it is not a good reason to exert some kinds of control.) This is pretty much the Kantian picture of the relationship of the individual to the State. Compliance is problematic if the underlying principle does not properly recognize or respect autonomy, but it is expected otherwise, because stability is something that strengthens individual application of autonomy in general. To the degree you create instability, you need to realize that others are involved, and not to treat them as means or as irrelevant non-entities. (This is why no one reads postmodern positions, and why I almost never write them. This is a lot of nonsense to get back to a very basic position that is better expressed based on simpler principles that are almost right already.) 

Ad hominem arguments are also often genetic fallacies. "Why should we consider the logic of a lesbian about family planning?" "Don't even bother to start mansplaining." "How could you know what is wrong with our two-party system? You aren't even an American!" This can't really be an argument from analogy, because bigotry is resistant to previous experience and is often formed in the absence of evidence. The assumption that two lesbians/men/foreigners will be alike in some way is, in some sense, an analogy, but it is not reasonable to assume that this is one of those ways. So the genetic fallacy kicks in before the analogy has any basis for application. 

The deduction is not valid. The modern translation of 'Some X are...' is 'There exists an (meaning at least one) X such that...' So, in modern parlance, you are saying: There exists a vegetarian dog. There exists a carnivorous dog. Therefore, there exists a vegetarian, carnivorous dog. The latter statement is false, since a being cannot be both vegetarian and carnivorous. But the premises are both true. (Sadly so, for the poor vegetarian dog.) Any syllogistic form with a real counterexample can't be valid. So this one is not a reliable form. And, yes, those three phrases all refer to different groups, represented by different choices that satisfy the 'exists' statement. You know the first two don't coincide because the dog that represents one group cannot be in the other, and therefore the third group is empty. 

I think there is a point in life where one realizes that one can be critical. So I would have to say that to some degree that initial intellect is entirely uncritically synthesizing. There is an age before language truly adheres (up to, on average, 18 months) when there is little evidence that negation applies to infants. Experiences can be positive or negative, but only as they are biologically so. To the extent language works, before that, it seems to be entirely operant conditioning without symbolic content. Memory works in terms of the evocative function of the hind-brain but without the calming-and-resolving intervention of the frontal cortex. Evidence for this phenomenon come from studies of early memory, where people find that experiences before that cutoff can generally not be considered analytically, and cognitive approaches to addressing their effects backfire, because invoking them either negatively or positively has the same effect. If this frontal function really does, as it appears, start development at a given age (instead of developing more continuously, sneaking on and only getting noticed at a certain point) then before that, I would say one cannot be critical or analytic, and we all have the experience somewhere of an entirely synthetic world. 

The 'Scientific Method' does not exist. How science is done varies across disciplines, across history, and across continents. But processes with specific aspects hold the ability to convince humans. One of those aspects is repeatability, and another is the ability to predict things that would otherwise seem unlikely. Earlier theories of science like Bacon's emphasized the former. A more modern approach like Popper's realizes that repeatability itself is an unlikely event, and puts all of the explanatory power of science in the hands of probability theory. Fischer (Student) had already formalized this into the mechanics of hypothesis testing. But later philosophers of science disagree, starting with Kuhn. They point out that a theory has to have an accessible mental model and an intuitive appeal in order to be spread and used. The ultimate skeptic here is Feyerabend, who points out that we can go back to the fact that science has always been about convincing people and say that is all we need -- a transferrable mental model with an intuitive appeal and some other psychological aspect that makes it seem reliable. On the other hand, probability theory is mathematics. Something is not true in math because it happens to be repeatable or to predict reality. It is true because of its internal structure and the power of its basic concepts. Mathematical theories are meant to be assembled out of 'pure' thoughts that we cannot reject fully once we have them. From a neo-Intutionist point of view, mathematics itself is the science of exploring the ability of our shared intuitions to combine properly. It is the oldest branch of psychology, in that it studies ideas themselves. It tries to determine which sets of ideas work together and do not lose cohesion in combination. In that way, in the way that what mathematics produces is not results but ways of combining thoughts to get new results, probability theory is a scientific fact. But the theory itself is a product of the mind, validated by the mathematical process, it is not a part of reality, it is a way of thinking. We trust it because it arises out of a process that we developed to consistently give us new ways of thinking that we can use well. So even to the degree probability theory is a part of science, it comes well along in the history of science. And even though it is part of the predictive mechanisms that we currently use to validate scientific thought, it has never been part of the process itself until very recently, and it may well not be a necessary part. Neither side of this complex insight seems to hold water. 

I would consider the whole of Marxism to lie within the philosophy of finance. It falls awkwardly between ethics and politics, and is anchored deeply in accounting principles, given the Labor Theory of Value. So I see no reason that theory and its contenders would not eventually become their own field. The idea that it naturally constitutes a separate field of philosophy may explain why different schools of philosophy are often quite chilly toward it -- it is 'neither fish nor fowl' in their reckoning. 

From an intuitionist notion of mathematics, this is exactly analogous to saying that since words cannot be unambiguously applied to objects in a perfect way, but have to be mapped on to them indirectly though experience, the entire content of language and grammar is 'just for itself'. We map mathematical structures onto observations in the hopes of using the implications of the mathematics itself to predict the observations. It happens every time we measure, and it gets more involved as we choose measurements that express more definite theories -- like when we assign a photon an imaginary number for its intensity, so we can interpret the imaginary rotation as interference. Every theorem from Complex Analysis then has application to this physics, few matter, but some are very helpful. This is exactly the same way we use language in physics. We call something 'work' because that captures an idea that behaves sort of like what we think of as work, and we use our intuitions about the more natural kind of work to make predictions about this new thing we have chosen to call work, for instance it consumes what we have chosen in parallel to call 'energy'. Would you question whether these words 'apply' to physics, or whether they should not have any implications about physics because they are really 'just for themselves?' in the way that they arise from a different motivation and also have other meanings in other situations? I hope not, because if you are also not going to apply mathematics, you are out of tools. 

What has replaced God in our thinking, and what is the range of options? How could we have gotten there without thinking about God/gods? If we really couldn't or wouldn't, what does that say about important structures in our thought? To what degree is our attachment to those things based upon the same needs/characteristics of our thought that were dependent upon God To what degree is our objection to other thoughts/practices based upon our rejection of God. (Anything nonexistent should be irrelevant, not decisive.) 

Intuitionism and Formalism are the two modern positions that tend to be contrasted with the synthetic, a priori characterization of Platonism. Formalism sees mathematics as just another science, meant to map onto outside world. It is a reaction to the discovery that our internal notions of negation and universality are very hard to reconcile, as pointed out by Russel's paradox. This makes the idea of an ideal world very hard to stomach. Either the ideals have a basic contradiction baked-in, or they are really something other than ideal. The focus is on finding a new internal basis that supports all useful mathematics, and feels more accountable internally, and discarding mathematics too far from testable application as places where internal contradictions might hide. It presumes mathematics, like all other sciences must be a-posteriori. Intuitionism supposes that mathematics is neither an ideal nor an approximation to external reality, but part of the structure of human psychology. It finds application to external reality in that humans are evolved to survive in the world, but it is only internally consistent to the degree that human language is. It does not accept the notions of universality or negation as clean and ideal constructions, but requires constructions in verbal forms to stay away from overdependence upon them. So, for instance, reductio-ad-absurdum is not acceptable as a way of establishing existence or universality, only as a way to forestall wasted searching for proofs of the contradicted concepts applications. Thus mathematics has a-priori components, but is not entirely a-priori, as it must be unfolded through contact with other humans' language structures. It is also partly analytic and partly synthetic to the degree that the bases of language are inborn but evolved. 

Discrimination and oppression are not the same thing. We all know people in oppressed minorities who actively hate members of the dominant class and treat them unfairly. But from the position expressed in the first paragraph of @ChrisSunami's answer, while this is discrimination (prejudice), it is not oppression (racism, classism, heterosexism, sexism, etc.) The U.S. Supreme Court, for instance, has outlawed various versions of Affirmative Action on the basis that they are discriminatory, without having to ask whether they are oppressive. In fact, they seem to clearly combat oppression, but the laws in question (based in part on the fifth amendment principle of innocent until proven guilty) are taken to charge the court with protecting individuals from groups and not protecting groups from groups. At the same time oppression can be mutual, when the constructs on which the oppression is based are mutually constructed. As a silly case, the French may oppress the English in France and the English may oppress the French in England. It is sometimes argued that women have historically constructed the male sense of self in most cases by doing the child-rearing. (This is the "MGTOW" position of psychological gynocentrism, once it is filtered of outright misogyny. Sorry, I really cannot give a reference that is not surrounded by additional material of which I would be ashamed.) The idea is that we have shaped male ethics to favor women, by filtering the teaching of ethics to males through female eyes for generations. From that POV, men's historical willingness to take part in things like conscription and other forced exposure to institutional service and judgement continues to be oppression of men by women (even when, like in the imbalance of court verdicts, one man actually imposes it on another most of the time, or like in the case of homelessness or suicide, it leads the man to make choices that devalue himself.) Then we need to resist this to the same degree we resist women's exclusion from participation in a broad range of powerful roles. It is very difficult to make racial or class discrimination by the oppressed class logically meet the standards of being bidirectional oppression. The privileged class member being discriminated against can almost always escape from the particular situation due to the attempted oppressor's lack of equal access to the means of control. If this can't happen, it is generally because of some intersectional effect, and not part of a pattern of reversed oppression. Intersectionality itself can be a powerful force, to which we do not pay enough attention. It is not unarmed black women being treated as if they were armed by the police on a daily basis. It was not lesbians being trapped in meeting places and burned alive, or dragged behind trucks, in the 70s. That does not mean that racism or heterosexism does not apply to women, but that it takes different forms (which are generally more severe, but less terrifying.)
