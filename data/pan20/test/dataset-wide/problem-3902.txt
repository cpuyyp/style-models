Pedro Resende understands this well. The interchange law in a double algebra (defined by Resende) is not satisfied by a double groupoid convolution algebra but I think that doesn't necessarily mean that a category fibred over the double groupoid is not a double category. So you can drop the interchange law, well at least that is what we considered doing. In the end it seemed that the idea of a weak Hopf algebra by Natale and Andruskiewitsch was the best approach! (So there is already a counterpart of a Hopf algebra for a group coming from coproduct if not a counterpart of a group convolution algebra coming from product.) 

Hi Mirco, I'm putting my comment as an answer in case otherwise you don't find it. I wonder if you need the "n-arrows-only" approach.... where language of partial monoids replace categories. For example where objects and 1-arrows are treated on the same footing as 2-arrows in a double or 2-category in which the identities are provided by the source and target maps. Proposition: A small double category is precisely a set with two commuting partial monoid structures. (And a 2-category similarly but with an extra condition.) Would it be at all useful to you to try to do this for the n-fold or for the n case? 

Here is the answer by Alexander Dynin to the preceding criticisms that I post on his behalf. I cannot post it as a comment being too long. A point of view from mathematicians would be helpful at this point. 

I am currently working on stochastic processes and I have met a stumbling block in the Ito integral $$\int_{t_0}^tdt'G(t')[dW(t')]^\alpha$$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha>0$. Textbooks result is given for integer $\alpha$ but not in the more general case that could not exist. Of course, also some good references are welcome. 

Let us consider the sum $$ m_N(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{cN}{2}-i(2c-1)\right). $$ The first step to get an asymptotic approximation is to extract the leading term in $N$ to obtain $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right). $$ When $N$ is finite, we recognize a Riemann series and apply the average theorem. So, there exists a value of argument of the logarithm such that $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+[f(x)]\log[z(x)]. $$ We can take $z(x)=\frac{c}{2}-t\[f(x)\](2c-1)$ being $t\in (0,1)$. Indeed, we can define a partition with $x_i=x_{i-1}+\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$ and so $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right)=[f(x)]\Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-i\[f(x)\](2c-1)\Delta x\right) $$ being $\Delta x=\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$. But this, in the given limit, is nothing else than $$ \int_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\frac{c}{2}-\[f(x)\](2c-1)}\log(z)dz<\infty $$ as it should. 

I refer to this paper. There is a straightforward approach in this case. You can separate the refraction index in the following way $$ n^2=n_0^2+\xi $$ where $\xi$ is the random part. Then, the equation is $$ \nabla^2U+k^2n_0^2U=-\xi k^2U. $$ Now, turning to the paper I just cited, take the Green function to be ($d=3$ for the sake of simplicity) $$ G(|{\bf r}|) =\frac{e^{ikn_0|{\bf r}|}}{4\pi |{\bf r}|} $$ and the differential equation turns into an integral one $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U({\bf r'}). $$ One can iterate this equation and obtain the following solution series $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})+k^4\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})\times \int d^3x''G(|{\bf r'}-{\bf r''}|)\xi({\bf r''})U_0({\bf r''})+\ldots. $$ By averaging on the distribution for $\xi$, a normal one by hypothesis, one gets a solution series in terms of the correlation function of the random variable. A simple case is this $$ \langle\xi({\bf r})\rangle =0 \qquad \langle\xi({\bf r})\xi({\bf r'})\rangle=\xi_0^2\delta^3({\bf r}-{\bf r'}) $$ yielding $$ U({\bf r}) \stackrel{?}{=} U_0({\bf r})+k^4\xi_0^2G(0)\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)U_0^2({\bf r'})+\ldots. $$ that is not well defined mathematically. You can consider a case with a finite volume and recover from this situation. 

I can't speak for an original motivation, but from a modern (geometric) point of view, the reason the preprojective algebra is an interesting object is that the moduli stack of representations of the preprojective algebra is equal to the cotangent bundle of the moduli stack of representations of the original quiver Q. 

Let G be a p-adic group, U a (n appropriate) unipotent subgroup and I an Iwahori subgroup. Then there are Iwahori decompositions I\G/I=U\G/I=W where W is the affine Weyl group. I suspect that $$Uw_1Iw_2I=Uw_1w_2I$$ whenever $\ell(w_1)+\ell(w_2)=\ell(w_1w_2)$. Is this true? 

Since this question was first asked, nontrivial decomposition numbers for Quiver Hecke algebras (=KLR algebras) have been discovered in finite type. Thus there is an alternative family of examples where the canonical and KLR basis disagree, if one is willing to accept ones algebras living over a field of positive characteristic. Known examples are not always explicated in the literature right now. The historically first example is due to Geordie Williamson - see $URL$ or $URL$ 

Consider the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian of k-planes in complex n-space. It has a standard presentation as a quotient of the ring of symmetric functions. In this presentation, the Schur functions are mapped to the Schubert classes, thus have a nice geometric interpretation. One can generalise the Schur functions to skew-Schur functions. Do these also have a nice geometric interpretation? 

The condition on $g$ gives a definite pde for $A$. This can be seen in the following way. Let us insert the solution $f=A(x,y)e^{ig(x,y)}$ into the Helmholtz equation. We get $$ \Delta A+2i(\partial_xg\partial_xA+\partial_yg\partial_yA)+\Phi(x,y)A=0 $$ being $$ \Phi(x,y)=i\Delta g-(\partial_xg)^2-(\partial_yg)^2+a. $$ Now, assuiming $L$ is a linear operator with the Green function $LG=\delta$, one can write $$ g(x,y)=g_0(x,y)+\int_\Omega dx'dy'G(x,x';y,y')h(x',y') $$ being $Lg_0=0$. By substituting this into $\Phi$ and the equation for $A$ we get a partial differential equation to solve. For some operator $L$, the final equation could be simple to manage but, for the general case, maybe some approximation techniques could help. 

I think your formula is not correct. The right kernel is invariant by interchanging $x$ with $y$. This symmetry must be preserved. Then, note that $$ L=-\Delta+ax^2+bx=-\Delta+a\left(x+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4a} $$ and this operator is invariant for translations. This means that the kernel for $b\ne 0$ can be obtained from the kernel for $b=0$ by translation of a shift $\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}$ and multiplying for the overall factor $e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}$. Once this is observed, we can consider the kernel for $b=0$, just the argument of the exponential, to be $$ S_0(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[(x^2+y^2)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t-\frac{xy}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right] $$ and apply the above translation to get $$ S(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[\left(x^2+y^2+(x+y)\frac{b}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t\right. $$ $$ \left.-\frac{1}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\left(xy+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}(x+y)+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\right] $$ and this gives the right kernel $$ K(x,y;t)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2\pi\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right)^\frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}e^{-S(x,y;t)}. $$ 

Since this recently got bumped by the community user, I thought I'd have a go at constructing an answer. The central extension (of G(ℂ((t))) by ℂ×) is algebraic. In particular it is a group ind-scheme, which I believe is strict and ind-affine. However, there does not seem to be a great place in the literature to find information about this central extension (so the OP is not being stupid in his searching). What immediately came to mind for me is Beilinson and Drinfeld's unpublished manuscript "Quantization of Hitchin's Integrable System and Hecke Eigensheaves." I can't say with truth that I am an expert on the contents within, but I believe the answers sought are contained within. Also worth looking at, as mentioned by abx, is the paper by Beauville and Laszlo, "Conformal blocks and generalized theta functions." On the Kac-Moody side, there is the paper "Construction d’un groupe de Kac-Moody et applications" by Mathieu. However once this is constructed, there is the question of comparing it to the loop group, which I don't know where to find an answer to. (On the other hand, Kumar's book doesn't seem to go as far as to construct the Kac-Moody groups as ind-schemes). Since cocycles were brought up, let me point out that for central extensions of group objects in a category C, for cocyles to exist, there must be a splitting in C (not as groups) of the map to the quotient. There will be no cocyle within the cateogry of ind-schemes. However at the level of R-points for some R, you could reasonably expect to find a cocycle. The paper "Block-compatible metaplectic cocycles" by Banks, Levi and Sepanski may be useful to some readers wanting to try their hand at certain explicit cocycles (I've found it useful myself in the context of metaplectic groups over local fields). Hopefully some intrepid MO reader will see this and be motivated to produce a thorough, reliable and accessible exposition of this field. 

I have met this problem in solving the classical field theory of a scalar field with a cubic term. I am able to solve exactly each equation, given in a form of odes, but this question escapes my current understanding and I will appreciate any clarification, even in the form of references. I have to solve an ode in the form $$ y''(t)+\phi(t)y(t)=j(t). $$ A straightforward approach I can devise is using Green function. So, I solve the equation $$ G''(t)+\phi(t)G(t)=\delta(t) $$ and I would like to write $$ y(t)=y_0(t)+\int G(t,t')j(t')dt'. $$ The problem is that, unless $\phi(t)$ preserves translation symmetry, the above equation cannot hold. This can be seen immediately by observing that one should have $$ G''(t,t')+\phi(t)G(t,t')=\delta(t-t') $$ but this cannot be generally true as instead happens that $$ G''(t-t')+\phi(t-t')G(t-t')=\delta(t-t') $$ and the solution should be written in another way. Is there a general approach to cope with a problem like this? 

There is no change into the probability distribution due to the absolute value. The reason can be traced back on the Ito's lemma applied to the derivation of the (Fokker-Planck) equation for the probability distribution: This will depend on $\sigma^2$. 

This kind of problem can be managed using a Fourier series for $x \in (0,1)$ and writing the general solution $$ u(x,t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}c_n(t)e^{i2\pi nx} $$ and $u(x,0)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}c_n(0)e^{i2\pi nx}$. So, consider the equation $$ \partial_tu(x,t)=D(x)\partial_{xx}u(x,t) $$ and insert the given solution into the equation. You will get a set of ODEs for the coefficients $c_n(t)$ as $$ \dot c_n(t)=\sum_{m}c_m(t)(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm} $$ where I have put $$ D_{nm} = \int_0^1dxD(x)e^{i2\pi(m-n)x}. $$ The problem is then reduced to a proof of existence and uniqueness of a set of ODEs making it somewhat more manageable and reducing to conditions for the matrix of the diffusion coefficient. Proof of uniqueness: Let us consider a generic matrix $D_{mn}$, we write $c_n(t)=c_n(0)e^{\lambda_nt}$ and substitute into the equations for the coefficients $c_n$. We get the eigenvalue problem $$ (D-\lambda I)\bar c=0. $$ being $D$ the matrix formed by the elements $-4\pi m^2D_{mn}$ and $\bar c$ the vector formed by the $c_n$ coefficients. Then we can state the following: Theorem: If the given eigenvalue problem has a solution with all distinct eigenvalues, this is unique given the initial condition $u(x,0)=f(x)$ that fixes the coefficients $c_n(0)$ unequivocally. This is true, provided the function $f(x)$ admits a Fourier series expansion $f(x)=\sum_nc_n(0)e^{i2\pi nx}$. This theorem does not give an existence proof. This can be obtained by perturbation theory. So, let us turn back to the set of ODEs we started from. We can rewrite them as $$ \dot c_n(t)=c_n(t)\epsilon_n+\sum_{m\ne n}c_m(t)(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm} $$ where I have set $\epsilon_n=-4\pi^2n^2D_{nn}$. We can rewrite this as $$ \dot b_n(t)=\sum_{m\ne n}b_m(t)e^{(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_n)t}(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm}. $$ Now, one has $u(x,0)=f(x)=\sum_nc_n(0)e^{i2\pi nx}$ and using $c_n(0)=b_n(0)$ one can iterate the above set of equations to get $$ b_n(t)=c_n(0)+\sum_{m\ne n}(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm}c_m(0)\int_0^te^{(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_n)t'}dt' $$ $$ +\sum_{m\ne n}(-4\pi^2m^2)D_{nm}\sum_{k\ne m}(-4\pi^2k^2)D_{mk}c_k(0)\int_0^tdt'e^{(\epsilon_m-\epsilon_n)t'}\int_0^{t'}dt''e^{(\epsilon_k-\epsilon_m)t''}+\ldots $$ It is worth nothing the following: 1) If this series converges then the solution exists and is unique in agreement with the theorem provided above. 2) For $t\rightarrow\infty$ this series contains polynomial terms in $t$, starting from second order, that can harm it. The point 2) shows that secular terms can be present and need to be resummed: they just give higher order corrections to the eigenvalues giving a series for them that must converge to the eigenvalue $\lambda_n$ introduced in the uniqueness theorem. When $D$ is just a constant, we recover from all this the ordinary solution of this parabolic equation as it should and all converges nicely. This means that, for any $D(x)$ a check for convergence must be performed using the above series and also that degeneracies are not present in the eigenvalue problem. 

It might not be the context you want (although if you think about this, it might be very close to what you want) but for some people a non-commutative bundle is a Banach bundle with non-commutative fibres. unlike a fibre bundle, the fibres are not necessarily isomorphic. Also bundles related to categories of Morita equivalence bimodules might be related at to the context I'm referring to because Connes' differential calculus is built into Morita equiv bimodules. The latter is a way to generalise the "tangent bundle" over the space described by A. I'm not an expert. Anyway, this approach seems to be working. 

This is an open question and it's to find out who is interested in this kind of thing, who can benefit from thinking about this. It is very brief but hopefully will only be unclear to people who are not into this anyway. Briefly, we can think of a Morita category (with object C*-algebras and morphisms bimodules) as a "weak" groupoid. It seems to me one can put a topology on the object space by thinking of it as a Banach bundle or continuous field of C*-algebras, which comes with a topological structure. This should satisfy axioms of a Grothendieck site (a topology on a category). So I think one can use this to define a weak topological groupoid. What about a weak differentiable groupoid or Lie groupoid? We can consider comparing this structure (with a certain sheaf over the site of objects) to a spectral triple with the geometrical data in the Dirac operator. I will stop to keep this short. This should lead to something closely related to Quillen's point of view on cyclic cohomology where the spectral triple algebra is also related to a Grothendieck site. The motivation is coming from Crane's "quantum geometries" for quantum gravity and I think there are unexplored conceptual intersections between category theory and non-commutative geometry. Thanks for reading! Sorry if this is not a math overflow type question but there is an indication that we may ask open questions. 

The nonlinear pde $$ \partial_t^2\phi-\partial_x^2\phi+\lambda\phi^3=0 $$ has the exact solution $$ \phi(x,t)=\mu\left(\frac{2}{\lambda}\right)^\frac{1}{4}{\rm sn}(p_0t-p\cdot x+\varphi,i) $$ with $\mu$ and $\varphi$ two integration constants and sn the snoidal Jacobi function, provided the dispersion relation holds $$ p^2_0=p^2+\mu^2\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{2}}. $$ If I interpret $p_0$ as the energy, it seems that is finite. Computing the integral $$ E=\int d^Dx\left[\frac{1}{2}(\partial_t\phi)^2+\frac{1}{2}(\partial_x\phi)^2+\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4\right] $$ and extending the volume to infinity, this is divergent. Can one find a sound mathematical explanation for this? Is there a way to "regularize" this integral? Thanks. 

A generic linear function in $t$ as $$u(x,t)=f_1(x)t+f_2(x)$$ does the job but, for the sake of completeness, I give here the result of Mathematica that involves ${\rm erf}^{-1}$, the inverse of the error function, $$u(x,t)=f_1(x)t+f_2(x)+\int_1^tdt'\int_1^{t'}dt''e^{-{\rm erf}^{-1}\left[-\frac{2}{\pi }\left(e^{C_1t''} (x+C_2t'')^2\right)\right]-\frac{1}{2} C_1t''}.$$ 

It can be shown that $[dW(t)]^\alpha=0$ with $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\alpha\ge 3$ generalizing the integer case. Let us consider the stochastic differential equation $dX(t)=[dW(t)]^\alpha$ with $\alpha>0$. We can write the solution in the form $X(t)=X(t_0)+\int_{t_0}^t[dW(t)]^\alpha$ with the integral in the Ito sense. Then, we have to evaluate this integral with the sum \begin{equation} S_n=\sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^\alpha. \end{equation} The power of the Brownian process can be evaluated in the following way \begin{equation} [W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^\alpha = [(1+W(t_k)+W(t_{k-1}))-1]^\alpha= \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1}(1+W(t_k)+W(t_{k-1}))^{l_1}= \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\sum_{l_2=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c} l_1 \\ l_2 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1} [W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^{l_2} \end{equation} provided $|W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})|<1$. Now, we can use stochastic calculus to remove powers higher than 2 and it is easy to see that \begin{equation} S_n=(-1)^\alpha\sum_{k=1}^n\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1}- (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)l_1(-1)^{l_1}\sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]+ \end{equation} \begin{equation} (-1)^\alpha\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\frac{l_1(l_1-1)}{2}(-1)^{l_1} \sum_{k=1}^n[W(t_k)-W(t_{k-1})]^2. \end{equation} So, we have the required expansion with coefficients \begin{eqnarray} \mu_0&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)(-1)^{l_1} \nonumber \\ \mu_1&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)l_1(-1)^{l_1} \nonumber \\ \mu_2&=&\sum_{l_1=0}^\infty\left(\begin{array}{c} \alpha \\ l_1 \end{array}\right)\frac{l_1(l_1-1)}{2}(-1)^{l_1} \end{eqnarray} Now we see immediately that $\mu_0=\left.(1-x)^\alpha\right|_{x=1}=0$. Besides, we get immediately the result that, for any real $\alpha\ge 3$, we have again $[dW(t)]^\alpha=0$ as in this case the coefficients are all zero when $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are evaluated thorugh Abel summation. Finally, when $0<\alpha<1$ both the coefficients $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are divergent and maybe no meaning can be attached to them (I have in mind summable divergent series here, any suggestion is greatly appreciated). 

The online notes of J.S. Milne on Class Field Theory contain a chapter on group cohomology including Tate cohomology that is easily accessible (and exactly what you need to understand class field theory). For algebraic intuition the keyword is derived functors. Group cohomology (and homology) are examples of derived functors, which can be considered as a reason why the definitions as are they are, and why they are interesting/useful. 

Certainly for any choice of convex ordering you can pick out a basis of your simple Lie algebra. You do this by specialising the construction of PBW bases for quantum groups to q=1. (This construction can be presented without knowing about quantum groups). With your proposed formula for $E_{\alpha+\beta}$ as a commutator, I would encourage you to modify it by dividing by $p_{\alpha,\beta}+1$ where $p_{\alpha,\beta}$ is the largest integer $p$ such that $\beta-p\alpha$ is a root. This way you will get the correct integral form of the Lie algebra. See e.g. these notes of Bill Casselman. I don't know if the formula $E_{\alpha+\beta}=[E_\alpha,E_\beta]/(p_{\alpha,\beta}+1)$ holds for all $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Certainly it holds up to sign. If you make a further assumption that $(\alpha,\beta)$ is what I call a minimal pair, then this formula is correct, even in the quantum case, see Theorem 4.2 of arXiv:1210.6900. 

As OP seems to be stuck, I give here the few lines needed to solve this problem as sugested in the comments. Given $$ f(\mathbf{r})=\int_{\Omega }d^2k\int_{\Omega }d^2q \cos[(\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{q})\cdot\mathbf{r}]= \frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{-i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}} +\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega }d^2ke^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}}\int_{\Omega }d^2qe^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}. $$ These integrals are easily done to give $$ f(\mathbf{r})=4\frac{(1-\cos(\pi x))(1-\cos(\pi y))}{x^2y^2} $$ from which the asymptotic behavior can be readily gotten. This makes clear that the question is not appropriate here. 

The best way to proceed is to use Legendre polynomials through the formula $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-2yx+x^2}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty P_n(y) x^n. $$ In this way you will get closed form integrals with the error function. 

The simplest approach one can think is an iterative one. Let us consider the given equation $$ f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xG(x,y)f(y)f(x-y)dy. $$ Now, we assume as a first iterate $f^{(0)}(x)=1$ and so $$ f^{(1)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y) $$ $$ f^{(2)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y)\int_{-\infty}^ydwG(y,w)\int_{-\infty}^{x-y}dzG(x-y,z) $$ and so on. One is granted the existence of the n-th iterate provided the integral of $G$ exists and is properly bounded. 

The easiest way to prove this is using variational calculus. You have to put $$ \delta I(G(\omega))=0. $$ The calculation is quite straigthforward and provides the condition $$ \delta G(\omega)=0 $$ and so the extremum is for $G(\omega)=G=constant$. Finally, from the condition you have to set $$ \int_{-k\pi}^{k\pi}G(\omega)=2k\pi G=1. $$ This gives the value of the extremum $G=\frac{1}{2k\pi}$. Expanded on OP request: The idea behind functional calculus (calculus of variations) is to consider a class of functionals, as in your case, that can be amenable to a generalized differentiation. You can find all the rules and the definition of a functional derivative here but for a more serious approach some lectures as the ones I pointed out in the comment area are needed. Your case is particularly simple as one is left in each term with the variation of $G(\omega)$ and this must be zero to find an extremum. Update on OP request: Let us introduce the following functional $$ Z_m[G]=\int_{-k\pi}^{k\pi}\frac{A}{G(\omega)+A}e^{-im\omega}d\omega $$ The functional we are considering takes the form $$ I[G]=Z_0[G]-\frac{Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G]}{Z_0[G]}. $$ Now we have $$ \delta Z_m[G]=-\int_{k\pi}^{-k\pi}\frac{A}{(G(\omega)+A)^2}\delta G(\omega)e^{-im\omega}d\omega. $$ Chain rule applies also to functionals and we can evaluate $\delta I[G]$ immediately to give $$ \delta I[G]=\delta Z_0[G]-\frac{Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G]\delta Z_0[G]-Z_0[G]\delta(Z_1^*[G]Z_1[G])}{Z_0^2[G]} $$ and we see that the condition $\delta G(\omega)=0$ sets the variation to zero. This solution is consistent with the given constraint provided $G=\frac{1}{2k\pi}$. The application of the constarint a posteriori fixes the value of the constant. Further clarification for OP: I will show that a functional that does not depend from at least a first derivative is a constant in one dimension. Let us consider the functional $$ S=\int_a^bL(q(t),q'(t),t)dt. $$ The condition for the extremum just gives $\delta S=0$ yielding Euler-Lagrange equation $$ \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial q'(t)}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial q(t)}. $$ Then, if there is no dependence on derivative we are left with $\frac{\partial L}{\partial q(t)}=0$ that implies immediately $L=L(t)$ and $q(t)=constant$.
