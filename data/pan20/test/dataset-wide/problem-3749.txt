Probably my questions are known or evident to the experts but I'm a bit puzzled. First of all there seem to be two kinds of zeta functions that go under the name of Shintani zeta functions. First, there are zeta functions $\zeta^{SS}$ associated with so called prehomogenous vector spaces going back to important work by Sato and Shintani (see the original article or this book by Yukie) and then, second, zeta functions $\zeta^S$ that appeared in Shintani's work on special values of Dedekind zeta functions of totally real number fields at negative integers (see Shintani's article or Neukirch's book for example). 1) I'm mainly interested in the question if it is known (or expected) if the latter zeta functions $\zeta^S$ satisfy functional equations. (From what I understand the $\zeta^{SS}$ satisfy functional equations or are expected to satisfy in case it is not proven). Let me just note that one can write Shintani zeta functions in the following form $$\Gamma(s)^n \zeta^S(s,z,x) = \int_0^\infty \cdots\int_0^\infty \sum_{z_1,\dots , z_n=0}^\infty e^{-\sum_{i=1}^n t_i L_i(z+x)}(t_1\cdots t_n)^{s-1} dt_1\cdots dt_n$$ where the $L_i(x)$ are linear forms, i.e. essentially we could say that we're looking at multivariable theta-like functions and Mellin transforms thereof. So the question can be rephrased in asking whether these theta-like functions occurring in the above integral satisfy a functional equation/theta inversion formula. (Note that these theta-like functions do in general not come from symplectic structures, i.e. they are not related to abelian varieties (at least as far as I see)). 2) But next to this question I'm also extremely interested in the relationship of these two kinds of zeta functions. In which cases do the two constructions agree? Is there anything known? Thank you very much in advance! EDIT: OK, so I could speak a bit with one of the absolute authorities in this field and I learned, that 1) one shouldn't expect functional equations for single functions $\zeta^S$ but rather for certain finite linear combinations and 2) one shouldn't expect relations between the two notions of "zeta" functions. This doesn't destroy the applications I had in mind with my question but I have to rethink the question and will try to give a better and less naive version of it soon. Thank you so far very much for your helpful comments! 

Reading the interesting paper Honest Bernoulli excursions by Smith and Diaconis motivated the question whether probabilistic interpretations for general Dedekind zeta functions are known. In the paper the authors consider a random walk on the integers $\mathbb Z$ with a particle starting at 0 and moving left or right with the same probability of $\frac 1 2$. Further, they let $T$ be the time of first return to zero , and $M_T$ the maximum distance from $0$ reached by the walk up to time $T$. Their main result says that the probability $$P(M_T \leq y \sqrt{\pi n} \ | \ T=2n ) = F(y)+ O(n^{-\frac12})$$ is uniformly in $y$, with distribution function $F(y)$ (defined on $[0,\infty)$ given by $$F(y) = \frac{4\pi}{y^3} \sum_{j=1}^\infty j^2 exp(-\pi j^2 / y^2)$$ The relation with Riemann's completed zeta function comes now from the observation that the "Mellin transform of the limiting measure $F$" gives 2 times the completed Riemann zeta function: $$\int_0^\infty y^s F(dy) = 2 \xi(s)$$ Recall that $\xi(s) = \Gamma(\frac s2+1)(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\zeta(s)$ (with the usual notations). My question is now whether similar probabilistic interpretations are known for other Dedekind zeta functions. A first guess would be to look at random walks on the ring of integers $\mathcal O _K$ of a number field $K$, or on some other appropriate spaces like certain (signed) integral ideals of $\mathcal O _K$. Is anything known in this direction? Any idea or reference would be highly appreciated. (I should say that my background in probability theory tends to zero, unfortunately.) EDIT: As I already pointed this out in the comments: What I am really interested about in some sense is the question (very vaguely speaking) whether the above procedure can be generalized to give a probabilistic interpretation to Hecke's method of expressing Dedekind zeta functions (Hecke did this of course more generally for Hecke L-functions) in terms of Mellin transforms of appropriate $\vartheta$-functions. (I have Neukirch's presentation of Hecke's work in his number theory book in mind.) 

This might be naive question but I was wondering whether a p-adic analogue of the following (shockingly) beautiful formula $$\zeta(s)\Gamma(s) = \int_0^\infty \frac{t^{s-1}}{e^t-1} dt$$ (vaild for $\mathrm{Re}(s)> 1$ and with all the usual notations) of Riemann is (well) known. So with a p-adic analogue I'm of course aiming at an integral expression for the product of the classical p-adic zeta function $\zeta_p$ that interpolates $\zeta(s)$ in its values at the negative even integers and $\Gamma_p$ might be taken to be Morita's p-adic Gamma function. (Note that up to a power of $t$ the right hand side of the above formula can be said (in a catchy way) to be the Mellin transform of the generating function of the Bernoulli numbers (which essentially give the values of $\zeta(s)$ at the negative even integers...)). What is "of course" lurking/hidden behind the above formula is the functional equation of the (completed) Riemann zeta function (for the time being I haven't learned/understood yet how this works in the p-adic setting, but I heard that in the work of Perrin-Riou, e.g., questions concerning functional equations of zeta functions in the p-adic world are dealt with (at least conjecturally)). So, in a broader sense my question aims at understanding how the functional equation works in the p-adic setting and whether there are "nice functions" behind, that implement the mechanism (in the complex, global setting this is related, e.g., to theta functions and Bernoulli numbers, and the above formula is one incarnation of the eternal beauty of this area of the (mathematical) universe). Thank you very much in advance for any help! EDIT: I'd like to make one aspect of my question more precise after having a glance at the nice Bourbaki talk of Colmez suggested by Olivier below. For example, the p-adic zeta function $\zeta_p$ of Kubota and Leopoldt can be constructed by constructing a "complicated" measure $\mu_{\zeta_p}$ on $\mathbb Z _p^\times$ by (making use of the Coleman map) and showing then that $$\int _{\mathbb Z_p^\times} \chi(g)^k d\mu_{\zeta_p} = (1-p^{k-1}) \zeta(1-k),$$ for $k$ an even and positive integer. (For $k$ odd we get 0). In the same spirit it is also possible to approximate p-adically special values of the completed zeta function (suitably normalized) which then satisfy a corresponding functional equation. My (very vague) question here is (maybe it's not what one should ask) whether one can write a (completed) p-adic zeta function in terms of an integral over a nice space with a simple measure but more interesting functions. In the description above of $\zeta_p$ the measure is very complicated but the function one integrates is quite easy. For example, is there some sort of p-adic analogue of theta functions that would do the job (suitable interpreted perhaps)? (I know that to $\mu_{\zeta_p}$ there corresponds a certain (formal) power series via the Mahler transformation but I don't see a nice interpretation of this "function" either at the moment...) (My apologies if this is way too vague for you...) 

For $C^{\star}$-algebras I would suggest in addition the lovely book of Gerard Murphy "$C^\star$-algebras and operator theory". If you are interested in K-Theory Blackadar's "K-Theory for Operator algebras" might be a good choice after Murphy's book. For Noncommutative Geometry, there are nice little introductory books by Varilly "An Introduction to Noncommutative Geometry" and Khalkhali "Basic Noncommutative Geometry". They are maybe more "beginner friendly" than Connes' master piece. 

Let $K$ be a number field, $L$ a finite abelian extension and $\chi \in \widehat{Gal(L/K)}$ a (non-trivial) character. If we multiply out the associated Artin L-function $L(\chi,s)$ we can write this as a finite sum of "partial" $\zeta$-functions $\zeta_\sigma (s)=\zeta_{\chi,\sigma}(s)$, namely we have $$L(\chi,s) = \sum_{\sigma \in Gal(L/K)} \chi(\sigma) \zeta_\sigma (s)$$ My first question is now if the partial zetas $\zeta_\sigma(s)$ are motivic? (EDIT: this doesn't seem likely, see the comments) By finite Fourier inversion we can express every partial zeta as linear combination of motivic L-functions: $$\zeta_\sigma(s) = \frac 1 {[L:K]}\sum_{\chi \in \widehat{Gal(L/K)}}\overline\chi (\sigma) L(\chi,s)$$ but I don't know if this answers my question. BEGIN (EDIT) Even if the partical zetas are not motivic it is pretty clear that they are not very far from being motivic. It seems reasonable to ask if known procedures in order to compute special values of motivic L functions carry over in a modified version to partial zetas. Let us for example consider the case of the Dedekind zeta function $\zeta_K(s)$ by the analytic class number formula we know that the leading coefficient $\zeta_K^*(0)$ at $s=0$ is given by $$\zeta_K^*(0) = \frac {h_K R_K} {\omega_K} $$ where $h_K$ is the class number, $R_K$ the regulator and $\omega_K$ the number of roots of unity. At present, my "favourite method" to prove the above formula is by means of calculating the volume of the Arakelov-Picard group of degree zero divisors $Pic^{(0)}(K)$. This is for example explained beautifully in the article of van der Geer and Schoof ($URL$ One question is now the following: Is it known if the volume of certain subspaces of the Arakelov-Picard group Pic(K) or certain quotients of the latter can be related to the leading coefficients at $s=0$ of partial zeta functions? If not the Arakelov-Picard group, are their attempts to my question using volumina of different spaces? (Unfortuanetly, I do not even know if the Arakelov-Picard group can be used to compute the leading coefficients of the Artin L functions $L(\chi,s)$ from above, but at least we have conjectures (Beilinson, ...) at hand which describe the leading coefficient...) END (EDIT) The motivation for my question is the following: (Roughly speaking) the partial zetas $\zeta_{\sigma}$ appear prominently in the work of Stark on explicit class field theory, their first coefficients of the Taylor expansion at $s=0$ are expected to be logarithms of units in $L$, thereby producing explicit abelian extensions of $K$. On the other hand Beilinson's program provides conjectural information about special values of motivic L-functions and I would like to understand if Stark's conjectures fit into this program or if they provide a refinement. 

Are the moduli spaces $\mathcal M _{g,n}$ expected to be anabelian? Is there anything known in that direction? Thank you very much for your help in any case! 

(One major difference is of course that Euler's expression doesn't involve the archimedean factor at all! I also lack a real understanding on why the archimedean Euler factor appears in Riemann's approach.) 

Dear mathoverflow community, I'm looking for a translation (English, French or German) of Drinfeld's paper "Coverings of p-adic symmetric domains". If there is no translation out there, maybe someone knows other sources where the content of Drinfeld's paper is covered (in one of the three mentioned languages). Thank you very much in advance. 

This question is about a remark made by van der Geer and Schoof in their beautiful article "Effectivity of Arakelov divisors and the theta divisor of a number field" (from '98) (link). Let me first of all recall that a curve $C$ over a function field can be recovered from its Jacobian $Pic(C)$ and its theta divisor $\Theta \subset Pic^{g-1}(C)$ ($g$ the genus of $C$). In their article van der Geer and Schoof construct analogues of the Jacobian and the theta divisor in the case of number fields. Namely they consider the Arakelov-Picard group $Pic(F)$ of a number field $F$ and define its theta divisor as restriction of the function $h^0$ on $Pic(F)$ given by $$h^0(D) = log(\sum_{f \in I} e^{-\pi ||f||^2_D}),$$ where $I$ is a lattice associated with the Arakelov divisor $D$, to the subspace $Pic^{(d)}(F)$ of Arakelov divisors of degree $d$. Here $d$ is a suitable analogue of the genus of a curve. Now they say that "it should be possible to reconstruct the arithmetic of the number field $F$ from $Pic^{(d)}(F)$ together with $h^0$". My question is now of course which parts of the arithmetic of $F$ are known to be recovered from their analogy? For example I would be very interested in the question if the units of $F$ can be recovered somehow. 

I'm interested in the following kind of questions about groupoid $C^*$-algebras. 1) If $G_1 \times_{H} \ G_2$ is a fibre product of (nice) groupoids do we have something like $$C^\star(G_1 \times_{H} \ G_2) \cong C^*(G_1) \otimes_{C^\star(H)} C^*(G_2) ?$$ 2) Of course, in general, there is an ambiguity about the above tensor product. So what is a good notion of amenability for groupoids? (In the sense that the groupoid $C^*$ algebra of an amenable groupoid is nuclear.) Apart from Renault's classic about groupoid $C^*$-algebras I do not really know any other reference for this subject. Thanks! 

Suppose given a finite extension $L/K$ of number fields. I would like to develop a better intuition for the Verlagerung giving an embedding $Ver : Gal(K^{ab}/K) \to Gal(L^{ab}/L)$. For example, let $L'/L$ be a finite abelian (Galois) extension. Define $\phi:Gal(K^{ab}/K)\to Gal(L'/L)$ to be the composition of the Verlagerung $Gal(K^{ab}/K) \to Gal(L^{ab}/L)$ followed by the projection $Gal(L^{ab}/L) \to Gal(L'/L)$. Then there is a finite, abelian (Galois) extension $K' / K$ such that $Gal(K'/K) \cong Gal(K^{ab}/K)/Ker\phi$. Is it true that $K' \subset L'$ or even $K' = K^{ab}\cap L'$? (we think of every field being embedded into $L^{ab}$) Further I would be happy about literature dealing with the Verlagerung in this context. Thank you very much in advance! Summary: As shown below, in the answer of GH plus comments, it is not alway true that $K' \subset L'$. But, if we restrict to strict ray class fields $L^{\mathfrak m}$ of $L$, for $\mathfrak m$ an ideal of $L$, one can show that for every $\mathfrak m$ there is an ideal $\widetilde {\mathfrak m}$ of $L$ with $\mathfrak m | \widetilde {\mathfrak m}$ such that $ K^{\widetilde{\mathfrak m}}$ $\subset L^{\widetilde{\mathfrak m}}$. Moreover, it seems that it is generally not true (except for trivial cases) that $K^{\widetilde{\mathfrak m}} = L^{\widetilde{\mathfrak m}} \cap K^{ab}$. But, nevertheless, the $K^{\mathfrak m}$ exhaust the maximal abelian extension $K^{ab}$ of $K$, i.e. $$\bigcup_{\mathfrak m}K^{\mathfrak m} = \ \ \bigcup_{\mathfrak m}K^{\widetilde{\mathfrak m}} \ = \ K^{ab}$$ 

I'm looking for a copy of the preprint mentioned in the title. Thank you very much in advance for any help! 

My excuses in advance in case my question is too vague (which is mainly due to the fact that I'm not really familiar with tropical/toric geometry, but at least I still believe that the content of the question is non-empty). I'd like to understand better the relationships between tropical and toric geometry. (The naive intersection of the two fields is of course due to the appearance of similar combinatorial structures in form of fans/polyhedra used in building the respective geometries). More precisely, I'd like to know now the following question: Suppose we are given a (nice) toric variety. Can we recover its "invariants/properties" in terms of an associated tropical variety? (The naive way would of course be to look at the tropical variety attached to the underlying combinatorial structures of the toric variety.) In fact, I'm most interested in describing the Todd class of a (nice) toric variety tropically. I'd be very happy about any kind of related pointers towards the literature or (philosophical) explanations. (Again, I'm sorry in case my question is completely off-track.) Thanks a lot in advance! 

The spectral characterization of Riemannian manifolds is a good example in my opinion. Details are given in the following article: $URL$ . 

Euler developed (at least) two different approaches in order to calculate the values $\zeta(-m)$ of the zeta function $$\zeta(s) = \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{1}{n^s}$$ at non-positive integers. In one approach Euler obtained the following formula for the zeta function $$\zeta(s) = (1-2^{1-s})^{-1}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac1{2^{n+1}}\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} (-1)^i \frac1{(i+1)^s} $$ by applying the so called Euler transformation to the series $\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n \frac1{(n+1)^s}$ (see for example the Wiki article Euler summation). One great advantage of this formula is that you can immediately calculate the values at the negative integers because the infinite series reduces to a finite sum in this case. Moreover this formula gives at the same time a meromorphic continuation of the zeta functions to the complex plane! In another approach Euler introduced a formal parameter $t$ and showed that $$(1-2^{m+1})\zeta(-m) = (t \frac{d}{dt})^m(\frac{t}{t+1})|_{t=1} = (\frac d {dx})^m(\frac{e^x}{1+e^x})| _{x=0} $$ This is for example described in the very nice book of Hida "Elementary theory of L-functions and Eisenstein series". Further, this approach could be generalized to "L-functions of totally real number fields" by Shintani, Cassou-Nouges and others (see again Hida's book, e.g.). My questions are now the following: 

I'd like to ask for references on the status of modularity results for elliptic curves with CM which are not necessarily defined over $\mathbb Q$. In the case of an elliptic curve with CM defined over $\mathbb Q$ I'm aware of a nice article by Shimura, where this is explained. Due to the fact of being an outsider in this business I would highly appreciate any hints/help towards the literature (or sharing of "common knowledge" in that field). Maybe I should say that for me modularity means to ask for a "nice parametrization" of the elliptic curve $E$ in hand in terms of an appropriate moduli space (of (elliptic) curves). More precisely, I would also be very interested in "nice (algebraic) parametrizations" which don't match up necessarily the Hasse-Weil zeta function of $E$ with an appropriate modular form, i.e. are there "reasonable" weak forms of modularity known for elliptic curves with CM? Thanks a lot in advance (and all my apologies in case this question is way too naive)!
