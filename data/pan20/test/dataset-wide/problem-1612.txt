He goes on to suggest using activated charcoal, though I would add that activated charcoal is much more expensive and should be disposed of more carefully. So while the baking soda may not work quite as well as advertised, it may still be the best option for most people. 

But when you get right down to it the only real evidence of the alleged mass killing is Case's account of being told about the incident by one person, now dead. In the ten years since this was first brought up has any other evidence of a massacre been found? 

The video by postcarboninstitute doesn't give any hint as to what metric they are using, but the most likely one I could come up with with is that companies in the financial sector made up 40% of all corporate profits in the years before 2008. The problem is that corporate profits are not "the economy" -- in fact all corporate profits last year amounted to about $1.6 trillion (I couldn't find numbers that were Q4, but it probably won't change much), while the total annual GDP was close to $14 trillion. None of this is to make a judgement on whether or not this is a good state of affairs, but postcarboninstitute should have probably phrased that statistic differently for the sake of clarity. 

Every month I peruse magazines like Fate and Atlantis Rising, and over the last few month there's been a lot of self-congratulatory chatter about the fact that Nobel Prize winner Luc Montagnier has supposedly done experiments that show some of the underpinnings of homeopathy have some validity. The Huffington Post wrote: 

Later in the Starchild Project the promoters of the skull dispute the hydrocephaly explanation. I'd like an expert on the subject to take a look at that page because I wonder if the doctors quoted could have been thrown by the fact the the "Starchild skull" would represent a completely untreated case of hydrocephaly, and you'd probably never see that today. 

So even in contests where speed was the goal neither competitor was using anything significantly different from a QWERTY keyboard. (Though the Caligraph's spacebars were those paddles on the sides. Not sure who thought that was a good idea.) By 1888 the problems of the type bars jamming that existed with the earliest Sholes & Glidden model had been solved, so the QWERTY persisted even as speed became paramount. I would guess this is because while the QWERTY keyboard was created to solve a specific technical problem in the 1870s, it turned out that it also inadvertently made typing in general faster by maximizing the alternation of hands when typing the most common letter pairs. 

As you can see Peter Joseph has a tendency to make long lists that conform to his theory, but few of the items on the list are true or real evidence of anything. Conspiracy Science has a full accounting of the Zeitgeist movie and related subjects. It's well worth checking out, even if navigation of the site is a little tricky. More generally, did the literary Jesus take on attributes from previous savior characters? Absolutely. That's a natural process. Does this mean Jesus didn't exist as a historical person? I'd say no. Around the same time similar supernatural acts were attributed to many Roman emperors and even the mathematician Pythagoras, and we don't use that as evidence that they were fictional. When it comes to that long list of saviors, it helps to remember that much of what we know about other religions has been distorted by the lens of Christianity. Even if it's not on purpose, we tend to highlight those attributes of other religions that resemble our preconceived notions, and downplay those that are different. Most of those on the list don't resemble Jesus's story nearly so closely as Joseph would have you think, especially the ones from non-European cultures. 

So no, the issue was widely reported the next Monday. The event which started the reporting appears to be the press conference by the police of Cologne at January 4th where the topic was on the agenda. ZDF ignoring the issue until Tuesday was a lapse by a single media outlet. One reason for the delayed news reporting might be that the police of Cologne itself reported on January 1st that the situation in Cologne during new year's eve celebrations was calm. Whether this was out of malice, incompetence or a mix of both is still a matter of debate, but nevertheless they got quite a lot of flak from various politicians for this. Official press releases are usually the main information source for the mainstream media, so when an information which contradicts official information gets publicized solely through social media, the reaction can be delayed. Although to be fair it has to be mentioned that there were press releases by the police which mentioned the incidents on january 2nd and 3rd. Another factor which might have distracted media attention was that there was a terror warning at new year's eve in Munich which resulted in quite a hysteria and was considered the more important event at that time. 

So no, the presentation by the media outlets mentioned in the question that the city of Cologne would want to fight the issue by sanctioning victims instead of perpetrators has nothing to do with reality. The actual reaction by the city government is to improve security in order to allow anyone to safely move through the city without being afraid of sexualized violence. 

Proving a negative is hard, but if such a statement would have made, it shouldn't be hard to find an official statement about this. After all, declaring "no-go areas" only make sense when people know they exist. Let's check the website of the cologne city government. There is a press release which does of course address this issue. It criticizes the police of Cologne quite harshly and demands a better cooperation between police and city, but does not demand any specific actions like enacting a no-go area. Another press release by Mayor Henriette Reker demands more security and better equipment. Among the demands are: 

tl;dr: yes, there were gays among the NSDAP leadership, but they killed them in 1934. The article you posted talks about Ernst Röhm, chief of staff of the SA (Sturmabteilung) between 1931 and 1934. The SA was the paramilitary wing of the NSDAP responsible for fighting street riots against opposing political groups and for harassing and intimidating political opponents. It did not represent the NSDAP as a whole, which also consisted of many other independent sections like the SS, the Gestapo and the political part. Although the official party doctrine of the Nazis was anti-homosexuality, it was an open secret that Röhm and many other leading SA members were gay. Hitler tolerated this because Röhm was an old friend of him and (at that time) very loyal to him. Röhm and many of his inner circle were murdered by other NSDAP members in 1934 during an internal purge operation called night of the long knives. The main reason for this action were internal power struggles between Röhm and Hitler: While Hitler wanted the Reichswehr to be the core of the Nazi state, Röhm wanted the SA to play a much more prominent role. This turned Röhm into a threat to Hitler. Whether or not Röhm's homosexuality was a factor in the decision to murder him and his inner circle is unknown, but it was later used to justify his murder to lower-ranking SA members. Fact is that the persecution of homosexuals in the 3rd reich intensified when Röhm's influence waned. This supports the hypothesis that Röhm and his circle represented a gay lobby inside the NSDAP which was rooted out in 1934. 

If he's publishing I'd say it's safe to say he's trying, but so far with no success, or even pregnancies. I'm also sure that if he is successful it will make headlines around the world, if only because the good doctor appears to be a bit of a publicity whore. There have been several other announcements that cloning has been achieved, going all the way back to 1978 and the book The Cloning of a Man, but none of them have come close to panning out. 

As the Citypaper goes on to document there could be no doubt that the situation at Camp Van Dorn was terrible and there certainly was violence. 

VC is also convinced that Lady Gaga is constantly revealing the Illuminati's plans in great detail to those who know how to read her videos, which is perhaps why Rihanna chose to be the princess of the group, not the queen. While VC takes Illuminati conspiracy theories to a silly new place, that's not to say there isn't a kernel of truth in the claim that there's occult imagery in some hip hop music. There certainly is. The influential artist Jay-Z has been including occult imagery in his music for years. As Mitch Horowitz told NPR: 

I'd like to offer an answer from a slightly different perspective. If the claim is that the QWERTY keyboard was designed to make typists slower, who were these typists who were so fast that they were causing problems with mechanical typewriters? Presumably on typewriters not using a QWERTY keyboard? In fact, there were no fast typists that predate the QWERTY keyboard. What we consider the first commercially viable typewriter was the Sholes & Glidden typewriter, produced and sold by Remington & Sons. It was not a huge success. As noted in American Heritage magazine: 

Montagnier won his Nobel for work in the field of virology, so this stuff doesn't sound entirely within his wheelhouse... but it's close. I don't think it would be right to dismiss his claims out of hand. Has this research been published? Has any peer review been done, or has anyone attempted to replicate his results? 

In 1998 a book was published called The Slaughter: An American Atrocity by Carroll Case. It alleged that in June of 1943 at an Army base in Mississippi 1200 black soldiers were massacred by white soldiers, and the entire incident was covered up. The allegation prompted investigations and a documentary on the History channel, which was summarized as follows by the Philadelphia Citypaper: 

The half-sibling in question is George Obama, who has lived at various times in Kenya and South Korea. (He also never knew his father, who died in a car accident shortly after he was born.) A few months after the Italian Vanity Fair piece saying he lived in abject poverty he was interviewed by CNN. 

I guess the question is really if the film (not video, it was shot on 16MM) shows an actual unknown primate. Probably not. From a credibility standpoint the film has always been difficult, if only because the original film has apparently been lost. Therefore, we only know what's in those few seconds of footage. I'd love to know what's on the reel before the famous sequence. As to the internal evidence you can garner from the film, I'd point to this frame from a later portion of the footage than you usually see. I'm not sure what's up with the sole of the Bigfoot's foot, but it doesn't look organic to me. 

As near as I can tell most of the people competing with McGurrin were using the only other major typewriter at the time, the Caligraph. From The Phonographic World, Vol. 3, #12 (August, 1888): 

Here's the source of the article, from Denmark's national channel. That is as close to any official word on the commercial I've found. It seems to me it would be easy to film the player shooting the shots and have a digitally removed person throwing different balls back to simulate the catches. That would also explain why the ball does come back to him a bit quickly. So if the video was trickery to start with, there'd be little point in anyone trying to replicate it without trickery. (And WOW... The new contextual translating Google does is pretty amazing. There are still some rough spots, but... WOW.)
