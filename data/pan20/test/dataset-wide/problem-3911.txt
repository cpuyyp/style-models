I've been trying lately to understand Fontaine's rings of periods, $B_{\mathrm{dR}}$, $B_{\mathrm{cris}}$, etc. However, I have a really hard time understanding and appreciating how to think about and use these. These rings seems so incredibly complicated and unintuitive it boggles my mind; I never seem to be able to remember their construction. So, how do I think about, learn and use these obscure objects? (Do I really need to know all the details in their construction to appreciate and use them?) In addition, I know the context and Fontaine's original motivation for considering these rings, but have they found any unexpected uses outside their intended domain? 

Let $K$ be a local field (in fact, finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$) and let $A$ and $B$ be abelian varieties over $K$. Associated to $A$ and $B$ are the Tate-modules $T_p(A)$ and $T_p(B)$. Both of these are canonically $G_K:=\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{K}/K)$-modules (or $K[G_K]$-modules if someone prefers this). What I want to do is compute $\mathrm{Ext}^1_{K[G_K]}(T_l(A),T_l(B))$ for all $l$, even $l=p$ (and if possible $\mathrm{Ext}^2_{K[G_K]}(T_l(A),T_l(B))$). Are there any results out there in this direction? If not, does anyone have a clue how to compute a projective resolution of a Tate-module (as a $K[G_K]$-module$? Also, would it matter if I instead considered the completed group algebra $K[[G_K]]$? Aside Yesterday I attended the ceremony where the named mathematician collected his Abel-price, and today, the Abel-lectures by said mathematician and Richard Taylor. Unfortunately, I realized I needed to know the answer to this question when I got back to my office, otherwise I could've pestered recipient and Taylor. :P But hey, now you all get to think about this instead! 

By far the best introduction I've seen is Milne's introduction Motives-Grothendieck's dream from his webpage. Beware though that there are a lot of things that you ought to know before you can fully appreciate everything in the paper. But even a superficial reading is highly rewarding and motivating! 

Well, I don't know any reference that examines ''each nook and corner'', but as Kevin says in a comment above, Washington's ''Cyclotomic fields'' is one good place to start (assuming you have enough grounding in algebraic number theory). In addition, Lang's ''Algebraic number theory'' contains some things on class number formulas I think; also we have his two-volume (now as one-volume at Springer) book(s) on Cyclotomic fields. But beware, I would say that these/this require a firmer background, than Washington's book. (Without encouraging illegal activities, I'm sure there are some bootleg versions on the net of the above books.) Otherwise, there are dozens of nice books on the subject. Also, there must be tonnes of free lecture notes out there in cyberspace. 

You could define a non-commutative affine scheme as the opposite category of a suitable category of rings. However, if you would like to think about prime ideals as points there are some problems. Namely, non-commutative rings tend to have very few prime ideals, so the geometric structure is to a large extent lost. On the other hand, a large class of algebras where a reasonable definition would be as you suggest is the class of polynomial identity algebras. These have more or less the same primes as their centres. Instead a natural way to define nc-schemes is as a category of modules over the ring in question - where the closed points are the simple modules. You should have a look at (if you haven't already) van Oystaeyen and Verschoren's work from the '70's, and more recently, the school of Michael Artin, including Michel van den Bergh, Paul Smith, John Tate and many many others (although they are primarily interested in projective non-commutative schemes). At the end of the day, as the comments above suggest, it is what you intend to do with your definition that decides what is an appropriate definition. 

(All this can be found in Weibel's survey in the $K$-theory handbook, or Kolster's survey from ICTP; google and ye shall find.) Now, my questions are: 1) Since the definitions of the $K$-groups are pretty topological in nature, in addition quite complicated (and I am very far from being a topologist), is there any 'reason' why this connection between $K$-theory and the arithmetic of number fields exists at all. It seems like a complete miracle. In other words, why should this connection exist? 2) What is the arithmetic significance of the torsion parts of the above $K$-groups? There is some information on this in Weibel's survey mentioned above, but I don't understand what he is talking about. Admittedly, question 1) is vague, but I hope it's clear what I'm after. 

Let us assume first of all that we are in the affine case (we can worry about globalization later) and that we have $X$ affine over $S$, where $S$ is some unspecified scheme (but in practice probably the spectrum of a field), with $X=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ (thus $A$ is an $\mathcal{O}_S$-algebra). We are emphatically not assuming $X$ to be smooth over $S$. Assume that we are given a map $\mathfrak{g}\to\mathrm{Der}_S(A)$ of Lie algebras and that we are viewing $\mathfrak{g}$ as a Lie-sub-algebra of $\mathrm{Der}_S(A)$. In analogy with the differential-geometric case we can interpret this as a distribution on $X$ and so we can ask: what are the integral subschemes of this distribution? Specifically, is there, through every point, a unique integral subscheme? And even more importantly, what can go wrong in the singular points and can we "integrate" this action to an analogue of a Lie groupoid? I'm seriously betting the answer to most of the above is a resounding "NO!" but I'm curious to know what can go wrong and what is known to go wrong? In short: what is known concerning this? Can one form something like "$X/\mathfrak{g}$"? Finally, let me iterate that I'm not assuming $X$ to be $S$-smooth. 

While I don't know the answer to the questions as I don't quite understand them, let me offer some remarks. There's sort of a ''misunderstanding'' of what a deformation is. What you are discussing here is only i very special case of a formal deformation. In general a deformation should take place in a (dream) moduli space of the objects you're deforming. As such a ''global'' space is rarely exists, one is forced to study the problem locally and/or formally (meaning that the deformation is described with a formal power series ring). Let us look at the formal case first as this is usually the first step in a deformation problem, the goal being to construct the completion of the local ring of the moduli space. To every deformation problem there is a cohomology theory attached. The first thing that one has to do is determine what this theory is. When this is done one computes is the tangent space to the moduli space in the point (object) one is interested in (in your case a matrix). This tangent space is described by the first cohomology group in the cohomology theory (usually some $\mathrm{Ext}^1$-group). Then one tries to ''lift'' this deformation to higher order deformations in order to obtain something formal. This is done by ''killing'' obstructions at each level in the lifting. These obstructions live in a second cohomology group (usually some $\mathrm{Ext}^2$). When all obstructions are zero the deformation problem is said to be ''unobstructed'' and the ring describing the deformation is a formal power series ring. This case is very rare but happens in many deformation problems at specific points. (I want to point out that deformations are only defined modulo some equivalence relation and this is in fact a very important thing to remember.) Ok, this formal ring (i.e., a ring that is a quotient of a formal power series ring) is now to be considered the completion of the local ring to the point in the moduli space. In your setup this corresponds to a deformation in one formal direction in the moduli space. However, you are implictly assuming that the deformation is unobstructed as you haven't factored out by any obstructions (i.e., there are no relations in the deformation ring). Alas, this is only a formal construction and not "useful" in geometry (at least in algebraic geometry; I suppose that in complex or analytic geometry the formal case would be ok, but I'm not really qualified to answer that). In any case, one needs an algebraization (think from formal power series to polynomial algebras). There is a deep theorem due to Micheal Artin saying that in many situation such an algebraization exists, but it is far from true in general and can be very hard to decide in specific cases. Let's say we have algebraizations around every point in ''moduli space''. One initial hope is to glue all these algebraizations to a global object. Unfortunately this is seldom possible in the category of schemes. A way out of this is to consider algebraic stacks but that's a whole other story. In any case, locally (formally) the moduli is described by the (completed) deformation rings. The deformation you're considering comes from the ''Gerstenhaber school'' which is, as I said, only a formal deformation in one direction with the assumption that the deformation problem is unobstructed. However, these kinds of deformations often appear as ''quantizations'' of Poisson algebras, Lie algebras, quantum groups etc. But in a strict sense they are not deformations. Ok, as for your problems, I don't quite understand how you're supposed to deform a non-commutative algebra with a commutative deformation ring. To me this seems to be an utterly impossible thing to do, at least if I understand your setup correctly. You could possibly make sense of this in some way but I don't know how. Therefore I would certainly say that the problem is rigid (or undefined even). If you were to deform specific matrices that is a very different thing, and certainly possible, at least if you forget the equivalences. However, and this is important, taking into account these equivalence effectively destroys the moduli space although locally it may well exist. In other words, it is not possible to glue the deformation rings in a sensible way without going to the stack language. As far as I can see, the Azumaya locus has no direct connection to deformation theory. It has to do with sheaves of algebras over a scheme such that locally it is a full matrix algebra. The Azumaya locus is the points on the schemes where this occurs. The other questions seem to be related to Cherednik algebras. See papers by Ian Gordon and collaborators. Edit: Oh, I forgot question 2, but I see that DamienC has already given a correct answer to that question. Not much more to say. Let me note however, that the only reasonable deformations in algebraic geometry are the flat ones, although in principle you could take more general morphisms. 

What are the crystalline realizations of Artin motives? In a paper by Kisin and Wortmann, "A note on Artin motives" (google it and you'll find it immediately), they define a suitable category of motives incorporating crystalline realization in analogy with Deligne's absolute Hodge cycles. However, they don't say explicitly what these realizations are (or at least I couldn't find it). Or can I find it somewhere else? 

Nancy Childress' book on class field theory has a nice chapter, even though it is more or less taken (in parts) from Washington's chapter 3 and 4. Lang's "Algebraic number theory" also has a chapter I think. Serre's "A course in arithmetic" is also nice. Edit: there is a rather thorough introduction to L-functions in Volume 2 of Cohen's Number theory. I haven't seen it myself, but from the table of contents it seems very detailed and from scratch-approach. As Kevin mentions Fröhlich-Taylor has a chapter on L-functions, but I find their book a little hard to read. But you might feel differently. I'll report back if I think of anything else.

In "Brauer groups and quotient stacks", Edidin et. al prove the following theorem: Theorem 2.7. Let $\mathcal{X}$ be an algebraic stack over a Noetherian base (of finite type). Then the diagonal $\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{X}$ is quasi-finite if and only if there is a finite surjective morphism $X\to \mathcal{X}$ for a scheme $X$. On the other hand, Kresch in "Cycle groups for Artin stacks" proves the following: Proposition 3.5.7. Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a stack of finite type over a field. The the following are equivalent: 1) The diagonal is quasi-finite; 2) The stabilizer $\mathcal{X}\times_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}}\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ is quasi-finite. Further, if $\mathcal{X}$ has quasi-finite diagonal $\mathcal{X}$ admits a stratification by quotient stacks. Now, suppose that $\mathcal{X}$ is already a quotient stack $[Y/G]$, say with $Y$ an affine scheme and $G$ some group scheme (both of finite type over a field). Then $\mathrm{id}: Y\to\mathcal{X}$ is a finite surjective morphism, so by 2.7 above have quasi-finite diagonal. Then by 3.5.7 the stabilizer is quasi-finite, but this seems false in general. For instance, take $G=GL(n)$ and then you are almost guaranteed to have non-finite stabilizers. What am I missing here? It's obvious that there's something here that I've gotten wrong.
