The answer for Question 1 is "yes". I believe this to be a little subtle. Firstly, as $j:H\rightarrow G$ is proper and injective, $j(H)$ is closed in $G$, and $j:H\rightarrow j(H)$ is a homeomorphism. So wlog $H$ can be identified with a closed subgroup of $G$, with $j$ the inclusion. You sort of hint at this in the statement of your question. Then, what is your map $J$? Well, if $\varphi\in C_c(H)$ then $f=\varphi\mu_H$ is a member of $L^1(H)$ (and such elements are dense). So $J\lambda_H(f) = \lambda_G(j^*(f))$ where $j^*$ is the pushforward $M(H)\rightarrow M(G)$. A more functional analytic way to think of this is to note that as $j$ is proper, it defines a map $\theta:C_0(G)\rightarrow C_0(H); g\mapsto g\circ j$ (as $H$ is closed, actually this map is a surjection). Then the Banach space adjoint is $j^*:M(H)=C_0(H)^* \rightarrow C_0(G)^*=M(G)$. Now, when does $J$ extend to a normal $*$-homomorphism $W^*_\lambda(H) \rightarrow W^*_\lambda(G)$? I like to think of this in an abstract harmonic analysis framework-- the predual of $W^*_\lambda(G)$, denoted $A(G)$, can be given the structure of a commutative Banach algebra: the "Fourier Algebra" as defined by Eymard. If we regard $\lambda_G$ as a map $L^1(G)\rightarrow W^*_\lambda(G)$ then we can regard $\lambda_G^*$ as a map $A(G)\rightarrow L^1(G)^*=L^\infty(G)$, and then this actually maps into $C_0(G)$ densely (this "is" the Gelfand map of the commutative Banach algebra $A(G)$, suitably interpreted-- if $G$ is abelian, it is the Fourier transform, hence the name). As $J$ is normal, it has a preadjoint $A(G)\rightarrow A(H)$, and if you regard these as non-closed subalgerbas of $C_0(G)$ and $C_0(H)$ respectively, we just get the map $\theta$ described above. So the question becomes equivalent to: does the map $a\mapsto a\circ j$ map $A(G)$ to $A(H)$ boundedly (hence automatically contractively). It turns out that the answer is: "yes". It's even a quotient map-- every $A(H)$ function arises as the restriction of an $A(G)$ function (identifying $H$ as a closed subgroup of $G$). This theorem is known as "Herz restriction", and the nicest writeup I know is an MSc thesis: Cameron Zwarich's thesis, see Section 4.2. Once we know $J$ exists, we know that $J\lambda_H(f)=\lambda_G(j^*(f))$ for all $f\in L^1(H)$, and as $j^*(f)\in M(G)$, it follows that $J\lambda_H(f)\in MC^*_\lambda(G)$, so indeed $J$ does restrict to a map $C^*_\lambda(H) \rightarrow MC^*_\lambda(G)$. The example of $\mathbb Z\subseteq\mathbb R$ shows we can't hope to get into $C^*_\lambda(G)$. Surely the same techniques give a positive answer of Q2. I think $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R/\mathbb Z=\mathbb T$ shows that Q3 does not have a positive answer in general; I think the Fourier transform shows that $W^*_\lambda(\mathbb R)=L^\infty(\mathbb R), W^*_\lambda(\mathbb T)=\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$ and the map $J$ should send $(e^{2\pi ixt})_{x\in\mathbb R}\in L^\infty(\mathbb R)$ to $(e^{2\pi int})_{n\in\mathbb Z}\in\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$. This doesn't exist at the $L^\infty$ level. You always have a map at the level of full $C^*$-algebras, $C^*(G)\rightarrow C^*(K)$ (surjective even, and no multiplier algebra) but amenability issues might becomes a problem trying to drop to $C^*_\lambda(K)$. 

and each symbol is at most $n$... Any ideas about where to find previous work? I can find the answers for small $n$ using a brute force search, but I'd like to know more generally. For example, $1^3+2^3+3^3+4^3+5^3+6^3+7^3 = 784$ Of the sequences of length $n$ using the symbols in $\{1,\ldots, n\}$, 5460 of them have this same sum of cubes. $5460-7!$ of them are not permutations of $[n]$. The same thing happens with the sum of fourth powers (but not when $p=5$). 

I thought of this while at the Combinatorial Potlatch at Seattle University, where Peter Winkler gave an excellent talk on Cops vs Drunken Robbers. I'll just open it up to the floor. The problem formulation might need some help too. Let $G=(V,E)$ be a loopless graph. Let $w$ be a non-negative integer (and $\infty$) edge weighting, and let $s,r$ be non-negative (finite) integer vertex weightings. Let $S$, $R$ be real functions. At each ply of the SWAT vs Rioters game we first remove the rioters, setting $r_v=0$, at any vertex $v$ for which the SWAT, $s_v$, overpowers them. The SWAT overpowers the Rioters (and perhaps arrests them all) whenever $S(s_v) \ge R(r_v)$. Then, either the Rioters or the SWAT, according to whose turn it is, must make a move by displacing at least one available unit from at least one vertex, along an edge, to at least one of its neighbours. The weight of the edge defines the maximum number of units that may be displaced through it, and units received from other neighbours in that ply are not "available" until the next turn. Precisely defined, the above says, for each $v$, set $r_v=0$ if and only if $S(s_v) \ge R(r_v)$, and then, if it is the SWAT's turn, create a temporary variable $s_v'$ for each vertex $v$, and set $s_v' \leftarrow 0$. For each pair of vertices $u,v$, with an arc $uv$, and some number of units $k$, with $0\le k \le \min(w_{uv},s_u)$, set $s_v' \leftarrow s_v'+k$ and $s_u\leftarrow s_u-k$. Finally, for each vertex $v$, set $s_v = s_v+s_v'$. Do the same with $r$ if it is the Rioters' turn. I'm only vaguely familiar with the usual Cop vs Robbers problems, but I suppose we would want to characterize conditions which are SWAT win, and find the number of moves it takes for SWAT to win, as well as an algorithm. Take for example, all edge weights equal to 2, S(k)=k^2, R(k)=k. Then perhaps 1 SWAT and 3 Rioters at each vertex. Does anyone care to propose interesting initial conditions? Cops vs Robbers is the case where edge weights are 1, S(k) = k, R(k) = k, 1 SWAT and 1 Rioter somewhere in the graph. 

You can give a characterisation of when it holds. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that $A$ is closed, i.e. is a C$^*$-algebra. Consider the universal enveloping von Neumann algebra, which I will consider as being the bidual $A^{**}$. If $\phi:A\rightarrow\mathfrak{M}$ is a $*$-homomorphism with $\phi(A)$ weak$^*$-dense in $\mathfrak{M}$ then there is a unique extension $\tilde\phi:A^{**}\rightarrow\mathfrak{M}$ which is a surjective, weak$^*$-continuous $*$-homomorphism. As $A$ generates $A^{**}$, your question has a positive answer if and only if $\tilde\phi$ is always an isomorphism. This is equivalent (consider the kernel of $\tilde\phi$) to $A^{**}$ having no proper weak$^*$-closed ideals. In turn, this is equivalent to $A^*$ having no proper $A$-invariant closed subspaces; and is equivalent to $A^{**}$ having no non-trivial central projections. See Volume 1 of Takesaki, Section III, Chapter 2. (I presume that $\mathfrak{U}'$, in your question, is not the commutant of $\mathfrak{U}$. This is slightly unfortunate notation...) 

Then $S$ is compact if and only if $X$ is compact. If $X$ is compact, then a simple $\epsilon$-net argument shows that (4) holds (using that the net $(a_j)$ is assumed bounded). Conversely, suppose that $X$ is not compact, so there is $\epsilon>0$ such that $X$ admits no $2\epsilon$-net. For any finite-dimensional subspace $N\subseteq E$, any closed and bounded subset of $N$ is compact, and so the distance from $N$ to $X$ must be at least $\epsilon$, say. By Hahn-Banach we can find $a_N\in E^*$ and $\omega_N\in X$ with $\langle a_N,\omega \rangle=0$ for all $\omega\in N$, with $|\langle a_N, \omega_N \rangle| \geq \epsilon$ and with $\|a_N\|\leq 1$. The (bounded) net $(a_N)$ hence shows that (4) does not hold. If $E$ is separable then you can consider (bounded) sequences in place of nets. Thus, I believe, your original question is equivalent to asking when the (left) multiplication operator given by $h\in M$ is compact. [ I stressed the word "bounded". If you allow unbounded nets then the condition becomes that $X$ has finite-dimensional span, i.e. that $S$ (equivalently $T$) is a finite-rank operator. In the sequence case, the Principle of Uniform Boundedness says you have to be bounded anyway. ] 

Let $A$ be a $C^*$-algebra. The Stinespring construction shows that a completely positive contraction $T:A\rightarrow B(H)$ has the form $T(x) = U^* \pi(x) U$ where $U:H\rightarrow K$ is a contraction, and $\pi:A\rightarrow B(K)$ is a $*$-homomorphism. The Paulsen 2x2 matrix trick allows us to characterise complete contractions similarly, by replacing $U^*$ with $V$, another contraction. Similarly, if $F$ is a Hilbert $C^*$-module over $B$ then a strict completely positive contraction $T:A\rightarrow L(F)$ is of the form $T(x) = U^* \pi(x) U$ where now $\pi:A\rightarrow L(G)$ is a $*$-homomorphism, $G$ being some Hilbert $C^*$-module over $B$, and $U\in L(F,G)$ is a contraction. (Recall, from e.g. Lance's book on Hilbert $C^*$-modules, that "strict" means that $(T(e_i))$ is a Cauchy net in the strict topology on $L(F)$, for some approximate unit $(e_i)$ for $A$. So, if you wish, you can just restrict to unital algebras, and then "strict" is a vacuous condition). It seems to me that: (a) The Paulsen 2x2 trick should also work here (although I haven't thought very long about this at all, because...) (b) if so, surely someone has already written this down (although a bit of MathSciNet work didn't find anything). So my question is: 

If I'm not mistaken there is another proof that BPI implies that any two bases of a vector space have the same cardinality. As has been noted earlier, if $(u_i)_{i \in I}$ and $(v_j)_{j\in j}$ are two bases of $V$ vector space over $K$ it suffices to show that there's an injection $I\to J$. We're going to use the equivalence "BPI$\iff$ Compactness for propositional logic". For each $i\in I$ there exists a unique minimal finite set $J_i \subset J$ such that $u_i$ is spanned by $J_i$. For $i \in I, j\in J$ we create a propositional variable $P_{i,j}$ supposed to mean $f(i)=j$. Then we create a theory $T$ that contains all the $\neg (P_{i,j} \land P_{i, j'})$ when $j\neq j' \in J$, and $\neg (P_{i,j}\land P_{i',j})$ when $i\neq i' \in I$. This is supposed to mean "$f$ is injective". But obviously this isn't enough (otherwise one could prove that any set injects into another), as we need to express something like "$f(i)$ is defined for any $i\in I$". This is where we use the $J_i$ : we add to the theory the formulas $\displaystyle\bigvee_{j\in J_i} P_{i,j}$ for $i\in I$, which is a well defined formula (up to logical equivalence), as each $J_i$ is finite. Now if $T$ is satisfiable, then we have found our injection : assume $v$ is a model for $T$, then $f:=\{(i,j) \in I\times J\mid v(P_{i,j}) =1\}$ is an injection, whose domain is $I$. Compactness shows it's enough to have $T$ finitely satisfiable, and if $T_0$ is a finite subtheory of $T$, ot is contained in a finite subtheory $T_1$ which expresses (modulo our identification) that a certain finite subset $I_0\subset I$ is injected into $J$ with every $i\in I_0$ being sent into $J_i$. Now unless I'm making a mistake, this is possible, as it only uses the cardinality of bases for finite dimensional spaces, which is true without any sort of choice. So $T$ is satisfiable, we have our injection, and symmetry + Cantor-Bernstein allow us to conclude EDIT : I might actually be making a mistake, it's possible that a "Hall's mariage theorem" argument can't be avoided 

The following question arose from a discussion about the definability of bases of $\mathbb{R}$ as a $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. (ZF without AC) something we can note is that the existence of a (definable) well-ordering of $\mathbb{R}$ is easily seen to be equivalent to that of a (definable) well-ordered basis of $\mathbb{R}$ as a $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space. After these remarks, the following question seems natural : Is it consistent with ZF that there be a basis of $\mathbb{R}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that cannot be well-ordered ?
