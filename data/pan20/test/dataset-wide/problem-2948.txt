I just read a biography of Abdus Salam, Cosmic Answer; and the author makes quite clear that he was deeply committed to his faith; though it wasn't by any means orthodox. Abdus Salam is a well known physicist; and was awarded the Nobel Prize along with Weinberg & Schwinger in the 70s for their contribution to electroweak unification. There are plenty of other examples from the history of science - Newton, Darwin and Einstein; as observation is a key means of gathering evidence to buttress argument in science, I'm sure you appreciate that science and faith can work together; its not 'logical' to assume that they cannot. 

I don't think a quantitative approach really works here. An important question for me, given how prevalent mathematics is in contemporary physics, is how much of physics can be motivated without appealing to mathematics. The milisian monists and the greek atomists developed the shape of physics within broad contours without appealing to mathematics: the unity of the world, its lawlike nature and its divisibility into atoms. This still holds in the contemporary situation, for example in quantum mechanics there is the notion of the quanta which is a discrete or atomic unit; in string theory even space-time is considered as atomic; if space was 2d, then one would have a picture similar to a carpet with tufted threads. The role that mathematics plays in physics is complex, and to be honest a quantitative approach yields little understanding: Classical Mechanics was discovered alongside calculus; symmetry considerations (amongst others) prompted Einsteins discovery of GR; matrices, a pre-existing mathematical formalism was used by Heisenbergs in his version of QM. More recently there has been a convergence of interests in mathematics and physics, in the 70s it was discovered principal bundles gave a geometric interpretation of Yang-Mills theories - hence of EM, QED & QCD; and in String Theory there has been a huge cross-over even with something as esoteric as arithmetic geometry. 

A lot of people in science talks about science as a discipline to find the fundamental laws or rules of the nature. They consider these laws to be the underlying mechanism that is making the nature as it is. Usually they will use mathematics equations to describe these so called fundamental laws. Now if you say that a particular mathematical equation describe the trajectory of a ball and this law is the underlying mechanism then who in the nature is actually computing the equation? Is it the ball, the particles, the earth, the air? Well the answer is nobody and that's what makes the whole argument of "underlying laws" or "how nature works" wrong. I guess the proper way to address all the scientific knowledge (or any knowledge for that matter) about nature would be that it is about coming up with "generalized representations" of the observations i.e it just "describe" the observations and it doesn't mean to find how nature actually works. 

Check out Appeal to emotion. This seems to best describe the conversation, where the use of word friendship is to focus on emotion than facts. 

suggests that it is neccessary part of any description of Nominalism, but not sufficient to adequately characterise it; I find that its more meaningfully understood when situated against the other options on the spectrum of possibility. 

The qualifier Absolute, signifies that space is to be thought of as an ousia, that is without 'reference to anything external'. Similarly for time, we have: 

One might say the Original Event in mathematics is Euclids axiomatisation of Plane Geometry. Subsequent axiomatisation - such as Peanos Axioms for the natural numbers being an echo of that Event, and so not an Event as such, in itself. But merely an application of an already discovered idea - axiomatisation. What are the nature of subsequent Events in mathematics? One might pause here, and say why, given the natural numbers, did axiomatisation wait two millenia. It surely isn't dependent on the difficulty of the task. So, Peanos axioms is possibly then a sign of an Event. Which one? 

A similar note is struck by Yeats, in his first political poem, Easter 1916 which marked the Easter Rebellion of Irish nationalism - which was put down within a week with many of its leaders executed: 

When something (in this case maths) becomes part of our daily lives in terms of how easy it is to use in our day to day lives and how "obvious" it seems, along with the fact that we are able to describe many phenomena around us using maths (Example: physics), we tend to start believing that "whatever" created this world must be based on the same math that we are used to. IMHO this is just a cognitive bias of humans. The universe is not based on math, instead we developed a tool/language called math which fits our cognitive abilities and its limitations and allow us to understand and explore the world around us. 

I wouldn't call infinite recursion an error, it is more about practical purpose and infinite recursion is of no practical use to us mortals as we cannot use it to reach any conclusion. But in terms of computation an infinite recursion/loop is a bug :) 

It has taken so many years for humans to develop math and it is still going on and will keep going on. It may feel very easy now to use math in our daily lives but we have reached that stage of easiness over a very long period of time due to some very deep thoughts of many people over this long period of time. So to answer your question, you should interpret the easiness as a result of enormous amount of effort over a long period of time. This reminds me of a quote - "Standing on the shoulders of giants". 

we experience ourselves as a self-conscious persons (strong) religious and cultural teachings coming from the environment where we live in (medium) philosophical discussions about definitions that becomes pointless by the nature of logic based on language (weak) 

Good question, not too wide, not too specific in my opinion. Maybe this is the place to give a definition to consciousness first of all. Conscious means a state of being aware, which comes from the Latin base word scire (sciō) meaning "to know" or "knowledge". Other derived words from scire are science and conscience. On the other side Greek counterpart for the verb "to know" is gnosis, which has a very probable root on Sanskrit word jnana (gñāna). I'm lifting this up to show that traced meaning of the word we use here has a pretty mystical background. And perhaps by this reason, we give consciousness a very mysterious meaning, like a magic soup that is flowing in us, our brains or in the world around us. I'd like to take a different point and view the mystery of the word coming partly from the "everlasting and doomed" efforts to define something that has no clear objective by limited and mixed words AND stubborn way we want to maintain the mystery for the word. Mystery itself is kept because of three reasons: 

Doubt, Arendt points out is the foundation of Modern Western Philosophy; but by this she does not mean everything is doubted, or made doubtful; it's a new beginning and a new faith, and it's this faith she says that has carried out the tremendous work in the modern era of thinking - a new critical spirit of enquiry. Had doubt qua doubt been properly implanted in this spirit, then like Hamlet who doubted himself and everything around him, nothing substantial would have been achieved. Descarte himself begins dubito ergo sum (I doubt therefore I am), and later merely says cogito ergo sum (I think therefore I am); and one might profitably say that the synthesis of dubito (I doubt) and cogito (I think) is I enquire (and of which I don't know the Latin - perhaps someone can fill in?) 

He means that it reveals the crudeness of both the audience and the comedian; but there are degrees of comedy; he notes for example comedy in Homer - whichis an epic. 

ie. seen as a unity, in the way that a word is made of letters, but we grasp it as a unity; to emphasise this, we could do something along the lines of Lycophron and just eliminate the space 

The explanation of something should have one important property - inference i.e given some facts what other facts I can infer about the thing using the explanation. That's the sole reason for the explanation/theory to exist. The thing itself that we are trying to explain is a bunch of facts that we can observe or observed but facts themselves are doesn't have inference ability until used along with some explanation. Now, what if the explanation is complex? What can we say about the inference ability of a complex explanation? The complexity will lead to the increase in the number of inferences the explanation could potentially produce BUT what if the explanation is more complex then the thing (or the collections of facts) themselves? In this case the explanation will infer facts that you can't even observe in the thing itself and that obviously is very weird. 

We can carry on this process until there is no further substitutions to make. Well, that condition won't ever come in this case as this is plain old infinite recursion due to self reference. If you can't reach a condition where no further substitutions can't be made you simply cannot reach a conclusion. In this particular case you cannot say S is true or false. Similarly if you email a person about some information and he never replied (in terms of whether he knows about it or not) for whatever reason, would you say that the person knows the information or he doesn't. 

We cannot immediately inhabit its world (frame); hence we must consider limits. Looking at a world which accelerates away from us we see its own time slowing, and it's length (parallel to its motion) shrinking; a second slowly stretching out to infinity, and the volume of the world shrinking to zero; to nothingness. At the limit, there is no time, motion is not possible; and consistent with Aristotles principle that time is motion, and thus requires Place; there is no Place either. Thus, no place in time and space; it's own world a void. 

This is the question posed by Duchamps infamous/famous object d'art that he submitted to an open exhibition that then refused to exhibit it; which under some readings, asked the question - what is art? Before one is a writer, or an artist; one is a human being with an aspiration to write or paint. The two situations that you suggest are not mutually exclusive or disjoint but touch each other at many points; and in fact, are grounded in each other. 

Which seems remarkable, in that any art can be practised without thought; but he means by this it seems articulate thought: 

I will go little deeper only to the first point. 2nd is the burden we get away pretty easily by education and 3rd is not so important thou it could raise a whole new topic to explain and prove what I mean with it. First case relates to mind, soul, Spirit and awareness topic. Until it is empirically proved that conscious exists outside of the person (brains) itself, there are no reasons assume otherwise. Its true there are a lot of stories in west (mediums, clairvoyance, OBE, afterlife experiences and so forth) and east (sadhus and yogis, meditation and monks) that gives interesting material for research, plus modern theories on quantum field gives new dimensions, but we still stick on open questions. No definite proofs has been provided that soul, spirit, mind or consciousness exists but in our body only. I say in our body, because I cannot deny that we experience consciousness, being aware of self (I am) nevertheless. Explanation for this comes from purely biological perspective. Sensory (five senses) system attached to a complicated electro-chemical neural network memory called brains gives an illusion of self-awareness by recursive and predictive signal transmission. Inner talk, imagining, day and night dreams, all are reflections of memory signaling back and forward on brain and sensory system interface. This is nicely explained on Jeff Hawkins's On Intelligence book, chapter 7 "Consciousness and Creativity". Topic is blogged on: $URL$ for example. In a way western and eastern mystics, that say the world and (some dare even to say) also the very self itself is Maya (illusion), are correct. They may add some other extensions to the fact, like oneness and bliss that can be experienced in spite of Maya. But they are not really proof of conscious being other than single mind product in a single person body. Now from this point of view answer to your question is: the characteristics of consciousness are subjective, memory dependant, temporal and changing, illusive, yet developing to some extend we don't really know yet. And yes, the word consciousness is very fundamental and practical to discuss on topic like this. It would be almost impossible to replace it with other descriptive word and still maintain focus and be understandable. 

For me, the term free is not some absolute on/off value, it is not either you have it or you don't. Freedom is about the number of choices you have at a point in time, you may have few choices so less freedom or more choices hence more freedom comparatively. Now let's say you have 3 choices at a point in time and you have choose one of them to move forward, then what should be procedure to determine what choice to make? There could be many ways to do that, for example: A lazy person may choose the one which would need less effort to carry out, a greedy person may choose the one which has most benefits in terms monitory gains and so on. Once you have made a choice and move forward you are presented again with a set of choices depending on what you choose at earlier point. This new set of choices may be large or small as compared to the previous one. The equation in the question says that the procedure that so called intelligent agent will use to decide the choice will be based on which choice right now will allow me with larger number of choices in future set of choices. Obviously the future should be some sensible threshold otherwise the agent will never be able to make the current choice. So, yes, you can be free and intelligent at the same time.
