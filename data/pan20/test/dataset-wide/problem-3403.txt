In more detail: Costs have two components: fixed costs (which do not vary with produced quantity) and variable costs (which do vary with produced quantity). For example, if you produce newspapers your costs might include 

Many of these things could be fixed with appropriate market interventions. However, there is a political economy dimension to the problem in that most of the British electorate lives in an owner-occupied house and therefore has a vested interest in maintaining the value of their house and preventing additional development in the area to the greatest extent possible. This possibly explains why candidates in the forthcoming election have focused mainly on proposals to subsidise demand (which would only exacerbate the problem!) or vague promises to build more houses, rather than on concrete plans (e.g. to reform planning) that would put-off a lot of middle-class voters. 

In your principles courses, you have probably seen problems that could be solved in this way, but were instead solved through some other method. almost certainly, the courses were organized like this in order to avoid making calculus a requirement. But, as the problems you tackle become more sophisticated, there comes a point at which the effort needed to learn calculus is much less than the difficulty of trying to figure out a way to do economics without calculus. To answer your explicit question, there is lots of calculus in economics. But, to answer the implicit question in the background, I don't think you should be too worried by this because: 

Here's a simple model to complement my less formal answer: A worker is of (privately known) type $H$ or $L$, each with probability $1/2$. The marginal product of the two types is $\pi_H>\pi_L$. The labour market is competitive so that workers are paid their (expected) marginal product. The worker can invest in education; doing so costs type $i$ $c_i$, with $\pi_H-c_L<\pi_L$ and $\pi_H-c_H>(\pi_H/2)+(\pi_L/2)$. The game is as follows: the worker observes his type and decides whether to invest in education. Employers then observe wether the worker invested or not and make competitive wage offers based on their beliefs about his productivity. Consider the following two perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) of the game. 

Can someone explain where the expression $\Delta(1 − e^{−rt})/r$ comes from? Whilst I am familiar with continuous time discounting, I have never seen it formulated in this way before. I would usually expect the expression for discounted profit to be $\Delta e^{-rt}$. 

If you know your Econ 101 then this can be understood through the lens of some textbook models. Remember that in a basic textbook model of a market, the social surplus is the area below the demand curve but above the marginal cost curve. Social surplus is maximised when $p=MC$, which, for information goods, means $p=0$. now think of a texbook monopoly model (where the monopoly comes because you own the copyright or patent): the monopolist will set $p>MC$ and this produces a deadweight loss, which is the inefficiency Arrow refers to. 

You say "energy and capital are complementary factors of production. So for instance if price of energy goes up, so will the price of capital.". I think you might have confused yourself because this kind of positive correlation in prices is not necessarily a property of complements (indeed, often one would expect the reverse to be true). It is more helpful to think of complementarity as "if the price of energy goes up then the demand for capital will go down" (in much the same way that people will buy less butter if bread becomes more expensive). The reason for this is not far from that proposed by andersan. Capital is often invested in machines (e.g., computers, robots, trucks, farm equipment) that require energy to operate. Consider a factory producing cars. It can assemble the car in various ways (a) by having a team of workers (labour) do the work, (b) installing robots on an assembly line, or (c) some combination of the two. If the price of electricity doubles then having a bunch of robots on the factory floor suddenly becomes more expensive because the energy needed to run them became more costly. Thus, the guy who was just indifferent between having a robot and a worker will now strictly prefer to hire a worker and the demand for capital decreases. Even if you have a business (e.g. long-distance transportation) where you cannot easily substitute capital for labour, there will buy some entrepreneur who is indifferent between buying some capital goods (e.g. planes) to start a business and not. An increase in the cost of energy (e.g. fuel) will reduce the prospective profitability of his firm and thus leave him strictly preferring not to invest. 

It's worth mentioning that Industrial Organization is typically not encountered as a stand-alone course until the late stages of an undergraduate degree or until graduate level, so books on this subject will typically be more advanced than a standard econ101 text. 

Note the the left-hand side of the last line in both sections is the same. Moreover, this expression ($P'(q)q+P(q)-C'(q)$) is the derivative of profits assuming zero tax. If profits are concave then this derivative is decreasing in $q$. We can see that, for any value of $q$, the right-hand side is smaller for the ad valorem tax (because it has an extra term that is negative--remember that $P'(q)<0$). Thus, we have something that looks like this: 

An issue for which economics performs better on all three dimensions might be said to be better understood. 

Since you mention competition policy, Motta's book on that topic "Competition Policy: Theory and Practice" is excellent (and puts all of the technical material into boxes so that it can be avoided if desired). For micro, a good upper-level undegraduate treatment can be found in McCloskey's "Applied Theory of Price". Now out of print, but available here: $URL$ If you would prefer a print book, I would also recommend "Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extension" by Nicholson and Snyder. The McCloskey and Nicholson & Snyder books are a bit more advanced than those used for a typical introduction to microeconomics, but I get the sense that that is what you are looking for.
