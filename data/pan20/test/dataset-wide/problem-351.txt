Could they maybe...if they are lucky. When it comes to this zombie apocalypse scenario its all about location location location. If you happen to have a bunch of pacifists on an island far away from the mainland they should do alright given they can actually find food and whatnot. Now...if they are on the mainland and zombies are around them things get tricky and it really depends on how they define pacifism. If they define pacifism as I will neither cause harm through direct nor indirect action well...they are pretty screwed and frankly...they should get eaten. Its one thing to be a pacifist toward other humans...another thing entirely to not be willing to smash in the face of a brain eating, undead, nature violating monstrosity. So this: Mmm...pacifist tastes like chicken 

Depending on your answers to these questions it can impact many things. Mainly you need to think about how it impacts the following: 

So do we have examples of religions that both preach and practice non-violence? As a matter of fact we do. Jainism has already been mentioned so I won't go into a ton of detail on that, another option is the Baha'i faith. This religion is interesting to me because it is monotheistic and Abrahamic and yet preaches (and has thus far) practices non-violence. There are a myriad of other smaller faiths or denominations that preach and practice non-violence as well. 

Climate change is the obvious answer in this scenario but I think Siberia is a bit more diverse than you imagine. Check out this map. The darker green, which makes up the bulk of Siberia is Taiga, and the lighter green above is Tundra. 

So for poison to evolve in a cat is not that improbable, after all it exists in the platypus and a loris. Importantly not all of these animals create their poison in their mouth. The Loris has glands under its arms not unlike a lemur. Though from what the article says they then apply their toxin to their teeth to deliver. Specifics to the cat: I would think the most likely evolutionary path for a cat would be a mutation changing the chemicals produced in their scent marking glands. If you're familiar with cats you know they scent mark and it stinks. My reasoning is that would be similar to the lemur/loris set up. Lemurs have glands used for scent marking, the loris has evolved similar glands to also be toxic. So there you go...its really not that far of a stretch biologically speaking. If you insist on delivery via claws that is a bit more challenging. Odds are a cat is not going to evolve glands in its feet nor hollow claws for injection. First, feed aren't a great place to have poison glands. Feet experience a lot of stress, cats walk run and climb so glands in the feet, not ideal. An important note is that cats already rely on their claws for mobility, grappling prey and fighting off predators. What I am trying to point out is that IF you had claws injecting toxins they would have to be hollow and hollow claws would not be strong enough for climbing thus reducing the viability of the species. They would also be less effective when grappling prey...again reducing viability. As for a solution, you can take advantage of the fact that a cat licks its backside...so it would similar to the loris create the toxin and then have it on its bite. I suppose it could walk through its own spray and have it on its claws as well but that would probably be less effective since walking would end up removing most of the poison in short order. 

Speed of travel is completely irrelevant ironically... Clearly, Santa is a mutant. He has many names...err powers but the powers relevant to his gift giving gig are as follows: 

Here's where the problem starts. Carrying enough water for 4 - 9 days in the desert is going to be difficult. Especially when you consider this. As should be obvious the higher the temperature and the harder the work, the more you sweat, the more you sweat the more water you require. 

A thought occurred to me while watching Ender's Game. Why are these two fleets in space lining up like two armies during the revolutionary war (or pick your war of the musket/volley era)? Thinking about it further it occurs to me that in basically all sci-fi movies with space combat going on the two sides are lined up on the same plane. (if you have viewing suggestions to the contrary I'd love to watch) I understand why this happens. It is what we are familiar with. Even when you are talking about aerial combat on earth you still have gravity and the ground as an anchor point for battle but not so much in space. How would the ability to function equally well in 3 dimensions affect combat tactics? 

Fire and smoke...and animal carcasses But you are not going to target the walls. In warfare it is generally best to strike the softest target. It does the most damage to the enemy and causes the smallest loss in your own troops. According to your question you are willing to wait years for the siege to be completed. So what to do with the items I listed. Fire and smoke: These two obviously go together. Lob oil canisters over the walls with catapults or trebuchets, target everything, the goal is lots of fire and smoke, not necessarily major damage to the fortress. After all, its a nice fortress a place an evil overlord may want to set up camp later. With the fire and smoke you could potentially create the fortress version of a beach head on the walls by making the defenders scurry away from the fire and smoke. Carcasses: If you are the patient type of evil overlord you can simply kill the defenders the slow and painful way (as opposed to the fast and painful way) by lobbing dead animal carcasses over the walls until they all, or most at least end up succumbing to disease... If you go this route it probably makes sense to keep the fire around for cleanup... 

If you look at religions in world history they are often a source of conflict. Disclaimer: Obviously this is not true of all religions nor is it a judgement on those religions for which it was or is true. Now, with that disclaimer in place, what is it about religion that can make it a vehicle for violence? With a few exceptions religious dogma generally preaches peace, and in the end people are the source of violence. But far too often religious belief is used to promote violence. What views, teachings, beliefs or rules allow this contradiction; preaching peace and promoting violent conflict? Or is it something completely unrelated to the religion at all? For a frame of reference this is the world in which this religion will exist, as well as some of my goals for the religion itself.
