No time to give a complete answer but just a hint to a possible direction. Sobolev spaces in $R^n$ arise as the largest possible spaces on which some functional ('energy') can be defined. So they are the natural domain of some important functionals, the basic example being the Dirichlet functional $\int|\nabla u|^2dx$. This is the most synthetic point of view I can think of, and I wouldn't say it has a geometric nature. However, you have natural generalizations of this kind of functionals on manifolds, so if that is your background, this might give you a better hold on the nature of these spaces. 

I think the bound is sufficient to prove that $u$ is a Schwartz function. Your assumption implies that $x^\alpha \Delta^p u$ is in $L^2$ for all $\alpha,k$. Thus for the Fourier transform $v$ of $u$ we have that $D^\alpha(|x|^{2p}v)$ is in $L^2$ for all $\alpha,p$. Take $\alpha=0$: we get that $|x|^{2p}v$ is in $L^2$ for all $p$. Now take $\alpha=(1,0,...,0)$: we have $|x|^{2p}\partial_1v+2p|x|^{2p-2}x_1v$ is in $L^2$ for all $p$, which by the previous step implies $|x|^{2p}\partial_1v$ is in $L^2$ for all $p$. And so on. Finally you get that $|x|^{2p}D^\alpha v$ is in $L^2$ for all $\alpha,p$ thus $v$ is Schwartz. 

Look at Figure 3 in the paper by Ginibre-Velo, point $C_2$ is the estimate of $\|u\|_{L^4\dot B^{1/4}_{\infty,2}}$ in terms of the $L^1L^2$ norm of $F$, and one has $\dot B^{1/4}_{\infty,2}\hookrightarrow \dot B^{1/4}_{\infty,\infty}$. 

Of course, as Helge says, the $H^1(0,1)$ norm controls the $L^\infty(0,1)$ norm, so you just write $$ \left| \int quv \right| \le \|q\|_{L^1} \|u\| _{L^\infty} \|v\| _{L^\infty} \le C \|q\| _{L^1} \|u\| _{H^1} \|v\| _{H^1}.$$ 

Just to make sense of your problem, think of the following special case: $a=1$, $b=0$ are both constant functions. Then every solution can be written as $z(x,y)=p(x+y)+q(x-y)$, and you have $$ z_x(x,y) = p'(x+y)+q'(x-y), $$ $$ z_y(x,y) = p'(x+y)-q'(x-y). $$ Thus you get $$ 2 p'(x+y) = z_x(x,y)+z_y(x,y) $$ which means, for all $s,t$ such that the points are in the domain you are working in, $$2p'(2s)=z_x(s+t,s-t)+z_y(s+t,s-t). $$ Now fix $s$ and move $t$ so that the line $(s+t,s-t)$ hits the boundary. You see that many problems arise. First of all, if it hits at two different points, the values must match (which is connected to Denis' remark that the problem is ill posed in a closed domain). But, more important for your question, the ratio $z_x/z_y$ has no role here, one needs that the sum $z_x+z_y$ remains bounded, so some cancelation is required. Unfortunately, if you do the same computation to calculate $q$, you get that also the difference $z_x-z_y$ must stay bounded. So I feel that there is no way to make sense of your problem... 

Note that your operator is not positive for the $L^2$ product. A better starting point might be $-Au=\nabla\cdot(c^2(x)\nabla u)$ which satisfies at least $(Au,u)\ge0$. That said, it depends how explicit you want your square root. For a selfadjoint operator $A$ with spectral measure $dE_\lambda$ you have simply $A^{1/2}=\int_0^\infty \lambda^{1/2}dE_\lambda$, an abstract formula which sometimes is surprisingly effective in explicit computations since the spectral measure has some nice representations. Of course, you also have the cheap factorization $A=B^*B$ where the operator $B=c(x)\nabla$ goes from $S$ to $S^n$, $S$ being the Schwartz space, but I guess this is not what you need. 

Gaussian upper bounds for the Neumann heat kernel on a large class of unbounded domains are proved here. Grigoryan cites a couple of papers by Guschin (in russian) claiming that he proved upper Gaussian estimates for the Neumann problem for parabolic equations on unbounded domains. See these notes. 

If $u_j$ is such a basis, from $(\nabla u_j,\nabla u_k)=0$ for all $j\not=k$ it follows $(\Delta u_j,u_k)=0$ which means $\Delta u_j$ is a multiple of $u_j$, and unfortunately $\Delta$ has no eigenvalues in $L^2$. 

I need an estimate of the form $$ \|v\|_{L^p} \le C \|(K-\Delta- c|x|^{-2})^s v\|_{L^p} $$ where $K>0$ can be large if necessary, $c$ is positive but below the Hardy constant $(n-2)^2/4$, where $n$ is the space dimension. The power $s>0$ can be equal to 1 or another integer if this simplifies the proof. This is trivial when $p=2$ and $s=1/2$, but I need $p$ near 4. Note that the heat kernel of the Laplacian plus inverse square potential does not satisfy the usual gaussian bounds, and this makes it more difficult to apply the standard techniques (even complex interpolation is not completely obvious). Any ideas? 

In your case I think you can apply Rellich's theorem, that is Theorem VII.3.9 in Kato's book (p.392 in my edition). The result states that, whenever you have a family of selfadjoint operators with compact resolvent, depending analytically on a real parameter on some open interval of the reals, with a common domain independent of the parameter (this is what Kato calls a family of type (A)), then you can enumerate both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions in such a way that they are analytic functions of the parameter in the same interval. 

It is not clear to me why in your estimate you put a function f depending on t. The norms are only in x, the operators act only on the x variable, so t is just a parameter and if your estimate is true it must be true for a function f independent of t. Also, I think the sign in front of $3/2$ should be a plus. Anyway, let's prove it for a function depending only on x. Let me call $S_t$ the scaling operator $S_tf(x)=f(tx)$. Then you can write $$ Z(s|D|)f= F^{-1}Z(s|\xi|)Ff=F^{-1}S_sZ(|\xi|)S_{1/s}Ff=S_{1/s}Z(|D|)S_sf $$ so the correct inequality can be written, with $s=\sqrt{t}$, $$ s^a\| S_{1/s}Z^a(|D|)S_s f\|_p\le C s^{a+3/p-3/q}\|f\|_q. $$ By the scaling property $$\|S_sf\|_p=s^{-n/p}\|f\|_p$$ and calling $g=S_{s}f$ all powers of $s$ cancel out, and the inequality to prove reduces to $$\|Z^a(|D|)g\|_p\le C\|g\|_q.$$ Now this is easy but let me tell you how to do it. The following inequality is just Sobolev embedding: $$\||D|^{-a}g\|_p\le C\|g\|_q$$ so if you split $g=g_1+g_2$ with $\widehat g_1$ supported on $|\xi|\ge2$, it takes care of the estimate for $g_1$. On the other hand $g_2$ has a compactly supported Fourier transform and the multiplier $Z$ is just 1 so the estimate is trivial for $g_2$. 

Your question can be interpreted in several ways, but I guess you are asking "is it a known space, or just some weird new Banach space?" If $\Omega=R^n$ and $s$ is noninteger, the dual of $C^s$ is known in the above sense (almost). Indeed, one can identify $C^s$ with the Besov space $B^s_{\infty,\infty}$, and duals of Besov spaces are well studied. The precise result is: denote with $\dot C^s$ the closure of the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions in $C^s$, then $(\dot C^s)'=B_{1,1}^{-s}$. I bet similar results should be true also on more general open sets $\Omega$ but I'm not sure. A good starting point are Triebel's books (Theory of Function Spaces I, II and III). 

This question comes from a problem in PDEs on which I'm currently working. Let $a$ be a $3\times 3$ matrix, real symmetric and positive definite. Denote with $\|a\|^2 _ 2=\sum a_{ij}^2$ the square of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and consider the quantity $$ Q(v)= 2\|a\|^2 _2 + [trace(a)-3(av,v)]^2 -6[2 |av|^2 -(av,v)^2] $$ where $v$ is an arbitrary unit vector. If $a=I$ is the identity, the quantity $Q$ is identically zero. QUESTION: are there other matrices $a$ such that $Q(v)\ge0$ for all unit vectors $v$, or is this condition equivalent to $a=I$? At least, it would be helpful if the matrix wizards around here could suggest ways to handle the HS norm, which is unfamiliar to me, and estimates relating trace, HS norm, operator norm and the numerical range of a matrix, which could possibly be of use here. 

Lars HÃ¶rmander did some work on classifying Mehler-type formulas for general quadratic fomrs in $\xi$ and $x$. Take a look at his paper on Math.Zeitschrift 219 (1995) pp.413-449 

The classical Gagliardo-Nirenberg proof covers the limiting cases $$\|f\|_{L^{\frac{n}{n-1}}}\le C\|\nabla f\| _{L^1}$$ and, for $f$ vanishing at infinity, $$\|f\| _{L^\infty}\le C\|f\| _{W^{n,1}}$$ which can not be easily recovered using the HLS inequality. On the other hand, HLS allows for a unified and simple proof of all the non-critical estimates, and includes the case of fractional derivatives. So I would say that the second method is stronger, with the exception of the limiting $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ cases. This is an argument for learning both methods :) The shortest proof uses the representation $$ |D|^{-s}f = C\ \ |x|^{s-n} * f$$ valid for $0 < s < n$. So you have $$ \||D|^{-s}f\| _{L^p} \le C \|f\| _{L^q}$$ that is to say, the Sobolev embedding $\dot H^s_q\subset L^p$, provided you can apply HLS, which gives you the condition $s-n/q=-n/p$. You see that with a very simple and unified argument we cover all cases including real $s$ and we obtain the homogeneous estimates without lower order terms. 

The title says it all. Suppose you are refereeing a paper where the author A makes strong statements about other papers by a different author B, like: the proof of Theorem 1 in paper [B] is wrong and we provide an alternate proof. One possibility would be to diligently read the other paper, compare the results, and decide. This doubles (or triples) the refereeing effort, and puts the referee in a more difficult position, opposing both author B and the authority of the other journal and its referees, in case he decides to support A's claim. I am not sure this is the proper course of action, especially when the disputed result is not of such importance to deserve an exceptional attention. Another possibility would be to ask the managing editor to involve (also) the other author B in the refereeing process, asking his opinion. The potential dangers in following this way are clear I think. What do you do in such situations? 

The short answer is: if you assume that $f$ decays exponentially only on one side (and increases say polynomially on the other side) then its Fourier transform is the boundary value of a holomorphic function, defined on the upper (or lower) complex plane. This can be made much more precise and the rate of increase as $y\to0$ is connected with the degree of smoothness of $\hat f$ 

This is standard and well explained in several treatises: the space $W^{s,p}$ belongs to the scale of Besov spaces, while $H^{s,p}$ is in the scale of Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The two scales satisfy mutual embeddings but the spaces concide only when they are $L^2$ based, while they are different when $p\neq 2$ (provided $s$ is not an integer). A good reference is the texbook by Runst and Sickel, Sobolev Spaces of Fractional order; or Triebel, Interpolation spaces (where the case of domains is analyzed in detail). 

The condition is $|c_n|\le A e^{-B|n|}$ for some positive constants $A,B$ and all $n$. This is not difficult to prove directly (a reference might be exercise I.4.4 in Katznelson's Introduction to Harmonic Analysis, but it is given as an exercise...). 

This questions stems from an attempt to recast in a form suitable for teaching some standard computations which are usually proved by handwaving, without much care about the details. My hope is that some expert in this area is hanging around and can give me an immediate answer off the top of their head... A function $f:I\to H$ from an interval of the reals into a Hilbert space is said to be scalarly integrable if $(f(t),x)$ is in $L^1(I)$ for all $x\in H$. This is sufficient to guarantee that for every measurable subset $E$ of $I$ one can find an $x_E\in H$ with the property $(x_E,x)=\int_E(f(t),x)dt$ for all $x\in H$. The vector $x_E$ is called the Pettis integral of $f$ over $E$. Now if $T:H\to K$ is a bounded map from $H$ to a second Hilbert space $K$, also $Tf$ is Pettis integrable and $T\int_E f=\int_E Tf$. This is quite easy to prove. I need the same property for any closed unbounded operator $T$. This kind of property is well known for stronger notions of integral (for the Bochner integral this is due to Hille), but I guess it is false in such generality for the Pettis integral. Now my question: assume I know that $f:I\to H$ is scalarly integrable, thus has a Pettis integral, moreover it takes values into the domain $D(T)$, and the integrals $\int_E f$ are all contained in $D(T)$. Can I conclude that $Tf$ has a Pettis integral and $T\int_I f=\int_I Tf$? EDIT: after an excellent series of posts, it seems that the question is almost settled, in the following sense. Assume in addition that $D(T)$ is dense and that $H$ is separable (or the interval $I$ is replaced by a discrete measure space). Then the result is true. This covers all the relevant applications, where the Hilbert spaces are some $L^2(R^n)$ and $T$ is a closed, densely defined operator like a differential operator possibly with variable coefficients. I think Bill, Gerald and fedja should wrap up their arguments in a short paper, this can be useful to other people, and the mathematics is not trivial. On the other hand, I do not know which posts should be checked as answer; the final word is Gerald's but Bill's key argument on finite sums is quite cool. Tell me what to do :) 

This is just a guess, I'm writing it since nobody commented on your question. You might want to check Yano's extrapolation theorem (see here for a nice exposition) which states that: if an operator $T$ is bounded on all $L^p$ for $p>1$ close to 1, and the norm grows at most like $(p-1)^{-1}$, then $T$ extends to a bounded operator on $Llog L$. Not exactly what you are asking, but this might give you some ideas to get started. 

Don't know for sure if this example qualifies, but it certainly is a hard problem which becomes trivial from the right point of view. (I learned this from Martin Gardner, proper credits might be researched if necessary). Problem: three circles in the plane, no two with the same radius, pairwise disjoint. For each pair of circles, there are four straight lines tangent to both; take the two which leave both circles on the same side; they intersect at a point. Repeat the construction for each pair of circles. We get three points: prove that they are collinear. You may want to think a little about the problem; can be solved both by plane or analytic geometry, with some effort. Not too difficult, but not a one-liner. Now consider the following solution: add a dimension. You have three spheres, and if you section them through their centers with a plane you get the original three circles. Consider the cones determined by each couple of spheres; the section is the couple of tangent lines seen above, and the tips of the cones are the three points in the problem. Now take two planes touching the three spheres from above and from below.... 

I think the cleanest proof is based on the coarea formula, which holds for pretty rough functions. Describe your set $D$ as the level set $\{F(x)\le t\}$ for some suitable function $F:R^n\to R$. By coarea formula you can write $$ \int _ {t-\epsilon<F(x)\le t}f(x)dx= \int_{t-\epsilon}^{t} \int_{F(x)=s} \frac{f(x)}{|\nabla F(x)|}dH_{n-1}ds $$ where $dH_{n-1}$ is the surface measure on the set $\{F(x)=s\}$. This gives $$ \epsilon^{-1}\int _ {t-\epsilon<F(x)\le t}f(x)dx \to \int_{F(x)=t} \frac{f(x)}{|\nabla F(x)|}dH_{n-1}. $$ To obtain your formula, just choose $F(x)=d(x,\partial D)$ (or if you want it smoother, $F(x)=d(x,D)-d(x,R^n\setminus D)$). 

Lipschitz continuous functions on $\Gamma$ are dense in $L^2(\Gamma)$ and are contained in $H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$.
