One way to find out whether a verb appears in two homophonous forms, with and without an 'implicit argument', or, on the contrary, the two homophonous forms correspond to different lexemes (= different homophonous verbs) and there are not any 'implicit arguments' involved, is to use the 'zeugma tests', and the easiest to apply in cases like the one you cite is (rightwards= R) 'R-gapping' [recall that leftwards 'gapping', L-gapping, is disallowed in SVO languages like English] subsequent to coordination - under the assumption that the R-gapped coordinate clause will only sound natural, rather than like a pun, when the omitted second verb is the same verb that occurs as an antecedent in the first coordinate clause and thereby licenses 'R-gapping'. In the case of the verb(s) give, then, if you coordinate two clauses like He gives blood and His wife gives to charity and try to 'R-gap' the second token of give, the result, He gives blood and his wife __ to charity, is obviously zeugmatic (i.e., either unnatural, or interpretable only as a joke, with the structure [He [gives [blood and his wife](= DO) to charity]]), which suggests that the two tokens of give that appear in those two clauses belong to different lexemes (= different homonymous verbs give1 and give 2), not that the first token of give is used with an 'implicit argument'. Much the same happens with (dictionary)'verbs' like drink that can apparently be used either intransitively (= 'with an implicit argument?'), as in He drinks (daily/too much), or transitively, as in He drinks only beer. In this case, the difference in meaning is more notorious, which points to the existence of two different lexemes (= two homophonous verbs drink1 and drink2), but let's apply a couple of 'zeugma tests' anyway and see whether the results corroborate that intuition. If we apply coordination followed by 'coordination reduction' (= CR), we get * He drinks daily/too much and __ ___ only beer, which is obviously zeugmatic (and plainly ungrammatical in this case). [Of course, we can save the construction by inserting a comma after the first coordinate, as in He drinks too much , and only beer, but that is no longer the coordination + CR test we are talking about here, but the addition of a parenthetic coordinate, which obeys rather different rules]. If we, instead, choose two parallel clauses with different subjects (say He drinks daily/too much and His wife drinks only beer) in order to be able to apply coordination followed by 'R-gapping', the result is * He drinks daily/too much and his wife __ only beer, which, again, is ungrammatical. Thus, in the case of drink, too, we should not say that the verb is used 'with an implicit argument' when intransitive; we must say that our lexicon contains at least two different homophonous lexemes, drink1 and drink2, with considerable differences in meaning and syntactic behaviour. Those are, perhaps, the simplest 'zeugma tests' lexicologists can use to determine whether any two tokens of a given 'form' are manifestations of the same lexeme or not, but there are other such tests, applicable to verbs as well as nouns (e.g., modification by adjuncts that may selectively apply to different 'facets' of a lexical concept represented by a unique phonetic-orthographic form). It would be too long to illustrate them all here, and it would lead us away from your question, but if you apply such tests in a systematic way, in principle you should always be able to decide whether an apparently unique 'verb' alternatively takes an argument explicitly and implicitly or, on the contrary, what happens is that the English lexicon contains two (or more) homophonous verbs with different adicity and more or less prominent differences in meaning. 

In my view, there is a very simple argument you can deploy to justify the claim that in He himself the head is he, not himself (assuming he himself is a single NP/DP constituent, which is a possible analysis, but not necessarily the right or only one, since himself need not appear next to he): if the contrary were true, the whole NP/DP would inherit the grammatical properties of himself, rather than those of he, would not carry nominative Case, and therefore could not be a legitimate subject of a finite clause like ...he himself could enjoy the corn. Furthermore, if himself were the head, he would have to be an optional 'adjunct' (note that it cannot be a complement, since himself is saturated), and, since optional adjuncts, by definition, need not be present, himself could by himself act as a DP/NP in subject position. Apart from the case issue that would raise, it would follow that an anaphor need not have a binding antecedent c-commanding it in the smallest clause that contains the reflexive, which, of course, violates Principle A of Binding Theory. As you can see, there are at least two rather solid arguments in support of the standard view that only he can be the head of the construction he himself (if it really is a 'construction' - a constituent, say at surface level - and has to be analysed as a single NP/DP). In case, however, you should remain skeptical and ask "How do you know that himself is not nominative?", the answer would be straightforward: if it were, * Himself could enjoy the corn should be a mere violation of Principle A of Binding Theory and Him could enjoy the corn should be a possible English sentence, but, of course, it is not. Finally, if you were to ask me, "How, come, can himself carry accusative case at all if there is neither a preposition nor a verb governing it whether it follows he or appears clause finally?", I can contemplate two possible answers: a), perhaps the most plausible one, that there is a hidden preposition (by, or maybe for?) (cf. He did it himself < He did it by himself), as there arguably is in cases like I saw her Saturday/last weekend, or b) that accusative is the 'elsewhere', or 'default', case (since nominative and genitive are assigned only in very specific contexts, subject of a finite verb or specifier of a Determiner or a noun, depending on your preferences concerning NP structure, respectively), an approach that the existence of 'absolute accusatives' in Latin and other languages could arguably endorse. 

In Old English, the "to" of "He asked to go to the store" would, indeed, have been a preposition governing a noun (in this case a 'noun of action' in the dative case). Since then, however, the "to" of infinitives has lost its capacity to assign dative case to its complement, its complement no longer behaves as a noun, and "to" has been 'reanalysed' as a 'function word' that governs/selects a VP complement with zero inflection (a 'bare VP'). Its precise syntactic category, however, has proven more difficult to establish. Since "to" can precede auxiliary "have" and "be", it has been considered similar to modal verbs, which also select bare VPs and precede such auxiliaries, and since it licenses VP ellipsis just as modal verbs do (cf. "They asked me to give a talk, but this time I prefer not to [give a talk]"), it has actually been occasionally argued to be a 'modal verb', but, of course, its being uninflectable makes that 'verbal' hypothesis improbable, and the fact that when the infinitival clause is negative negation must precede "to" definitely discards that analysis as untenable. Pace Lawlor above, however, "to" cannot be a 'complementizer' ('Comp', 'C'), either, since a) it must follow the complementizer "for" and the accusative-Case subject that must nowadays accompany it (cf. "It was a mistake for him to tell his wife he had lost his job"), and b) it must also follow interrogative "wh"-phrases in focus that must, in their turn, follow complementizers (cf. "I don't know what to do" vs. "*I don't know to what do"). Thus, Modern English "to" is surely some kind of function word (a 'functional category', in Chomskian jargon) that a) precedes aspectual auxiliaries (which, as stated, makes it similar to modal auxiliaries), but b) cannot be inflected and must follow complementizers, foci, subjects, and negation (which precludes its being treated as a modal verb, or, in general, as an auxiliary, after all). What kind of 'function word' is it, then? Since it seems to be in paradigmatic opposition to Tense/Finiteness (called 'Infl' in Chomsky's GB and P&P theories of the early 1980's), Chomskian syntacticians have long classified it as an 'Infl [-Tense]'. However, it cannot literally occupy the same slot [+Tense] does above all auxiliaries because tensed auxiliaries must precede clausal negation (negative 'Polarity') (cf. "He should not have accepted" vs."*He not should have accepted"), whereas, as stated, "to" must follow clausal negation. [N.B.: when it seems not to, as in "To not go to your mother's wedding would be unacceptable" (usually: "Not to go to your mother's wedding..."), it is because "not" is not really clausal negation, but VP-internal negation, as it clearly is in "You cannot [not go to your mother's wedding]"; note that in that context "can" rejects a clausal complement, cf. "*You cannot not to go to your mother's wedding"; correspondingly, a bare (non-clausal) negative VP is not allowed in subject position, where only infinitival clauses are possible, cf. "*Not go to your mother's wedding would be unacceptable"]. In sum, a) "to" is a 'functional category', b) selects bare infinitives, c) is non-finite, so [-Tense], but d) does not alternate with [+Tense] in the highest T/Infl position. In early Chomskian GB/P&P analyses, that was a problem; in later 'minimalist' ones, however, any clause containing n verbs (i.e., a 'main' verb plus n-1 auxiliaries) also necessarily contains n 'Infl' heads, and, under such assumptions, there is no problem in categorizing "to" as an 'Infl[-Tense]' provided it is clear that it must be lower in the tree than the Infl[+Tense] that contains the tense and agreement features that characterize finite clauses. Whether you choose to label it 'I/Infl[-Tense]', or 'Inf'(initival), or anything similar does not really matter, but you should certainly not label it either 'Aux [Verb]' or 'Complementizer'.
