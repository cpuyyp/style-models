In my opinion, the most reasonable option is to comply to what "bus traffic lights". BUT, I think this junction lacks bike traffic lights. 

Old, plain, one-gear Velosteel-like hubs had this feature thanks to using rollers instead of cogs, but I suppose it does not meet your expectations. If you REALLY need this feature you can modify Shimano Nexus 3 to obtain what you want by removing four cogs from part no 4 shownhere. You will lose 1st gear, rest will work as before. 

Three bikes were wrapped with stretch foil, with almost no disassembly, just handlebar turned by 90 deg. One bike was totally disassembled, including derailleur removal, and put in soft bicycle-bag. No damages were observed. 

All this lights should be mounted no lower than 250mm and no higher than 1500mm above the groung. Passive reflector, lit with another vehicle's high beam, and all lights should be visible at night with good clarity of air from a distance of at least 150 m. Except rear red passive reflector, all lights can be dismounted when not required (eg. during the day) 

edit after comment: This photo should explain why wheel is not conjugated with chain, while no force is applied on the pedal. At the right side we can see rollers in its housing. It slides back and forth. 

After a bit of thinking I filed off cogs from the outside. So far so good, hub presents good enegagement at all gears. After few weeks it still runs good. Left is "fixed", right shown for comparison. I fixed (filed) both. Be careful to make them equal shape and that sharp border is not too thin and ortogonal to the side surface 

As @Kristian said, best option is to choose bike size that fits you at the moment. If you're afraid that your bike will become too small too fast and you don't want to spend money on second new bike, consider buying pre-owned bike now. If you really want to buy oversized bicycle, make assumptions about your future height by taking into account your (especially male) kin's height. It could be burdened with non-negligible error. 

Set the shifter to 7th gear. Push the cord toward the shifter. The cord ending should appear in the hole. Pull it. 

This photo is even better. 2 clutches. Moving forward pushes right against hub housing, conjugating sprocket with hub housing. Moving backwards pushes left against coaster brake pad. Pads does not rotate because of being engaged with brake arm attached to frame. Because of friction hub housing start to conjugate with brake pad. No force applied - everything disengaged. 

EDIT: safety first. Even if you are allowed to ride side by side in exact situation, be ready to pull back if there is any threat that bad driver would try to push you off the road. Have a camrecorder if possible and submit recording after all to local police. It depends on your local regulations. It would be nice if you would post here apropriate extract from swiss road regulations. In Poland, where I live, riding side by side is legal under some circumstances. 

unscrew adjusting screw on the brake lever housing by 3 turns, secure it with nut. unscrew brake pads holders, push the pads towards wheel as far as possible (this will increase braking force), tighten it a bit unscrew brake cable holder on the brake arm, pull it as far as possible - pads should touch the rim. Tighten the screw. Adjust pads that they are adjacent to the rim, tighten them screw adjusting screw mentioned in pt 1 back. 

Poland In my country, a bicycle that is power-assisted with the <=250W <=48V electrical engine, that assist rider up to speed 25km/h is still a bicycle, no matter how energy to power the engine is obtained. All the laws for regular bicycles applies to it - dimensions, equipment. Speed limits apply to such bicycles as to any other kind of vehicle. There are no additional restrictions. 

I would search for "Pininfarina bicycles". I saw one time bicycle with similar basket. The basket was very uncommon for me, because basket and the handlebar is one piece. That bicycle had nothing else in common with your bike, BUT when you browse for "Pininfarina bike", 

The primary reason why bike messengers use messenger bags is that you don't have to take them off to load or unload them. If you're continually picking things up and dropping things off all day, you don't want to be faffing about taking a backpack on and off all the time. A secondary reason is that the flat rectangular shape of a messenger bag is more suited to the kind of things that messengers tend to be carrying (e.g. documents). As to why the rest of us non-bike messenger types use them, there's no question that fashion is a large part. We all want to pretend we're one of those messenger free spirit types, rather than stuck in an office all day ;-) But as well as being perceived as more cool, messenger bags are good for carrying laptops due to their flat rectangular shape. Backpacks that are designed for cycling don't tend to be as suitable for full size laptops - for example, my Deuter rucsac is fantastic for mountain biking, but my 13" laptop is quite a squeeze to fit in. (Of course there are cycling backpacks designed to take laptops, but they're not widely used from what I've seen). Personally I'm lucky in that most days in the city I'm riding a Brompton folding bike, and I use a messenger bag that clips to the frame when I'm riding: 

I too agree that they're really boring. Have you considered rollers? They take a little to get used to, but they're less boring (because you have to balance) and really good for developing smooth pedalling technique. They also don't seem to wear out tires as quickly. 

If you ride on a trainer some of the time, consider getting a set of rollers. They force you to ride smoothly at a high cadence so you don't bounce up and down, and I've seen them dramatically improve my girlfriend's pedalling technique. They're much better for your technique than a turbo trainer. 

I always found a house brick to be the perfect height and obviously nice and solid (and unaffected by sweat!) 

They have one big benefit on road / commuting bikes - they stop the valve corroding and seizing due to the salt and crap they get exposed to. On a mountain bike, this isn't such a problem, as the salt gets washed off by puddles and mud (and you tend to wash your mountain bike more). That's been my experience in the muddy, wet UK, when the roads are salted for over half the year. I leave them on the road and commuting bikes, and leave them off the MTB for speed of tyre changing. 

Are you thinking to get a small BMX and take the drive train off instead of getting a run bike, so you can put the drive train back on when he's ready? Otherwise I don't quite understand the purpose of the question, sorry. If that is you're idea I'd suggest that's probably not a good idea. It's going to be difficult to find a BMX small enough for a two year old to easily put their feet down and run, and you're paying for extra components (chain, cranks, pedals, brakes) that you don't need. Unlike an adult bike those components aren't likely to be easily removeable, and it's likely to be a lot heavier and more clumsy for your son to use. A run bike is going to be focused on what is most important at that age - teaching balance - and everyone I know who has had one has enthused about how easily their child was able to transition to a bike with a drive train after having a run bike. Also, because they tend to be quite well made and not abused, there's a healthy market in them on ebay, so you should be able to sell it relatively easily when it's time for the first proper bike. 

It's possible you damaged your rim, but it should be very easy to check. Turn the bike over and spin the wheel and eyeball it both side to side and up and down. If you have put a flat spot in the rim it should be very noticeable. It's more likely that it is just the way the (flat) tyre is sitting on the rim, which might well be affected by the valve. If you've got a narrow tyre and a lockring on the valve, that may be holding the tyre on the rim at that point only, causing a wobble when that part of the wheels hits the ground. 

Depending on design, try ensuring all bolts are tightened evenly (so if the top two are done up all the way and the bottom two are not, undo them all and redo them evenly) 

Sounds like you have only surface rust. The frame would have to rust through to cause any integrity problems and that would take many years of damp conditions. The creaking you hear when shifting your weight to the bars may be the headset. It may be worth getting it serviced. As its likely the grease has escaped/become clogged with dirt causing the creaking. It would be wise to check all the joints and welds for signs of fatigue or cracks. Ensure they are all solid. 

One for every removeable or adjustable part on your bike (including tyres). With the exception of those you will be unable to repair/fix on the trail, such has hubs and bottom brackets. They need not all be combined with one tool though (sometimes individual tools can be lighter) 

It could be a number of things. The most likely it sounds as if your cable is sticking/jamming. Try replacing your cable and cable housing. This shouldnt cost much for DIY (read up on how to do it, you dont want to crush the housing when cutting), but would cost more from a mechanic. I would firstly check that your deraileur isnt out of alignment and/or loose or bent first. Another thing you can do is check that you have the right chain for your cassette and that the chain isnt worn (a cheap tool will check this for you). If your mechanic has not solved this, I suggest trying a different one. 

Perhaps try for a used fork. For a decent new 29er fork you're looking at Â£250+ (I estimate thats around $300) (such as rockshox reba) - or go rigid. It's sureley better than a cheap fork. 

I have a modern bike (ridgeback meteor '13) and It currently has a 21 speed shimano chainset. I find that going down hills (which I do a lot) and on flats I need a higher gear. Can I do anything to get a higher gear ratio (such as a bigger large chainring) or am I already at the top? Spec: 48/38/28 Chainrings 12-32 (7 Speed) Cassette: 

I can appreciate that some materials are lighter than others and some have more flex than others, but overall, how do different frame materials affect handling of the bike? Assuming the same geometry and design. What are the main handling characteristics of each of the below common frame materials? 

One tip I have picked up to avoid cars passing so close is to ride further away from the kerb (but not so far you're hogging the road and then drivers get annoyed). This seems to have some pycological effect on drivers to give you more room. I can't explain it, but found it to work in most cases. I have also seen bikes with mirrors fitted and some sort of plastic distance keeper (a pole that sticks out with a reflector on, I would imagine this needs to break if a car hits it.) 

Bikepacking tends to be more lightweight and generally doesn't involve panniers or racks. Just look at the rigs used by tour divide riders ($URL$ If you think you need pannniers, then perhaps you are talking about touring rather than bikepacking. Bikepacking luggage will typically require one or more of the following: 

You will find (usually an allen/hex key) bolt on the brake pad itself. Loosen that, align your brake pads then re-tigthen. You may also need to adjust again on the bars to get it to fit. You will also find it easier when loose and aligning them, to pull the brakes right up to the rim and tighten the bolts. Everything you need to know you will find here: $URL$ 

Manufacturers will use machines to build the wheels, however on top end bikes the manufacturer will build the wheels by hand (a skilled wheel builder's work is considered better than that of a machine). Your LBS will unlikeley have a machine to build wheels and this will be done by hand. So in summary. New bike - wheel was most likeley build by machine. Repairs - wheel was almsot certainley built by hand. As @arne said. You can search youtube for "cycle wheel building machine"
