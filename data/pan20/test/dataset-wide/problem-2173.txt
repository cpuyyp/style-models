For many years, I have used a blog as a repository of useful information - first solely for myself, then to share with others within and outside of my company. At work, I mostly dump data and notes to my blog in an unpublished state. It's quick, easy, and painless. It uses almost no work time. Then, from home I polish up the posting a bit and publish it. At any one time, I have dozens of unpublished articles. Some of them stay unpublished for a long time, some forever. I've only worked at one shop which prohibited occasional blog posting while at work. In that case, I just emailed my notes to my personal email account and blogged from home. To know what is and isn't permitted at your specific company, the answer is simple - ask your boss. 

The policy speaks only about non-exempt (hourly) employees. You have indicated that you are exempt. Thus, the above policy does not apply to you. The policy is indicating that non-exempt employees must be paid for all of the hours they work in the week in which they work those hours. If a non-exempt employee worked 48 hours, they would presumably be paid for 40 hours of regular pay, plus 8 hours of overtime. The policy is indicating that managers are not allowed to pay the non-exempt employee 40 hours, and give them 8 hours off another time as "comp time". When your boss said 'we are exempt employees and do not get comp time', he was basically telling you that (like many salaried professionals), you will periodically be expected to work extra hours, and will not normally be compensated at all - not with overtime, and not with comp time. He still may choose to deal with the situation in an unofficial manner (as he did with you this first time). 

At least in the US, unless you or one of your references bring it up, a future employer has no way to know the details of any contracts (verbal or otherwise). You will certainly be burning some bridges with your current company if you quit now. And others in your current company may think less of you. It's also possible that you might be asked to pay back some of the increase you received. But overall, this is very unlikely to make you look bad to future employers. 

That's indeed a possibility. If that's a real worry, then seek to get as much as you can in writing. And if you are very worried about the effects of leaving and accrued vacation pay, you may wish to re-consider your desire to work at a startup. Startups policies often change rapidly. Startups are not for everyone - some folks prefer more certainty. 

When you are asked a question, you are best served by just giving a simple, honest answer rather than trying to psych out what your boss really wants to hear. When asked "What are you doing this afternoon?" you could have answered "I don't really know, because I don't usually schedule my afternoons, and here's why..." Then you could follow up with "Would you like me to handle this differently?" When asked what time something occurred, you can answer "I'm not sure - I think it was about xx o'clock". If you don't understand why your boss asks you any question, find a quiet convenient time and ask him. "Hey, boss. Remember when you asked me xxx? What was your thinking around that? I'd like to understand better, so I can give you a more useful answer next time." When people on my team ask me such questions directly, I'm never offended. I consider it a smart thing to go directly to the source, rather than just guessing. Only your boss can tell you what he was actually thinking, not anyone here. 

Unless you are willing to forfeit your chance at the job you are interviewing for, there is little you can do. It would be ideal if all business folks respected everyone. Unfortunately, not everyone is well-mannered and professional - even when they have an interviewer role. Thus, you could: 

It's perfectly reasonable to send a resume and cover letter now. In your letter, make sure you indicate your current status and expected graduation date, so as not to cause any confusion or annoyance. Be sure to express your enthusiasm for this company (since enthusiasm goes a long way), your desire to work there, relevant skills and technologies you already know, and perhaps how you learned of them. You could also indicate your desire to intern there, if such a position were available. It's unlikely a company would hire you now, when you aren't actually available until next spring. That's a somewhat long wait for many companies - but you never know. Sometimes, startups are in hiring-mode, and could bring you in as an intern now with the thought to bring you on full-time upon graduation. Sometimes, startups in hiring-mode keep a list of entry-level candidates for the future. Since you already know one of this company's requirements (a 4-year degree), then I'm assuming you have seen or learned about an actual job posting. Try to indicate in your resume and cover letter how you meet many of those requirements, even if you don't yet have the degree. Many startups are far more flexible and less formal than more established companies. When I worked in startups, I was much more free to "think outside the box" when hiring than when I worked for larger companies. This works in your favor. 

Certainly, but you really shouldn't do that via email. Instead, send them a note saying something along the lines of: "Thank you for accepting me. I'm really excited to get going on this project! When would be a good time to call you and discuss compensation, start date, hours of work, etc?" This way, you show that you are eager and ready, but indicate that you are expecting some sort of compensation for your work. You also haven't indicated a formal acceptance yet. Then, you follow up with a phone call at the agreed-upon time, hammer out the details, and formally accept (or not). You haven't made it clear if you will be considered a temporary worker, or an intern. In some companies interns receive compensation, in other companies they are not compensated. It's unfortunate that you didn't have this conversation during the interview, but now you need to deal with it directly, before you formally accept their offer. 

If someone on my team tells me that they have decided to leave, I would seldom bother negotiating at that point. People leave for a variety of reasons, getting into a bidding war only impacts one of those reasons. Of course it's "okay" to go get another job offer first, tender your resignation, and then somehow hope for a counter-offer. But why wait until you resign to talk about the other offer? That might be too late for your current employer to take action, and could leave you in an awkward position with your new employer. Instead, talk to your manager now about your current compensation, and your feelings that you are worth more. Discuss specifically how much you want. And if don't get anywhere with your manager, you can decide to either hint or directly tell him that you are looking elsewhere. This move has its risks - your manager could let you go right away - but also has the possibility of starting a negotiation. It's always okay to make a move like this in your own career. Just know what you really want, what you are willing to settle for, and be aware of the potential risks. 

If you include an Objectives section on your resume, that is where you want to state that you want to change your focus. In addition, this is where your Cover Letter becomes even more important. In it, you should mention your change in career focus, and specifically emphasize your desire to get into the exact domain being offered by the position you are seeking. And of course during the interview, you'll be looking for signs that this new position isn't just web-centric, and will give you the non-web exposure you desire. And you'll want to be well prepared to discuss why you want to change your focus, and why this will be terrific for the hiring company. 

In most cases, you would interview for the job. It's not clear if interviews will be conducted in this case or if a decision will just be made without interviews. Either way, you should try to talk with the decision makers and state your case as to why you are a great fit for the job. The decision makers might include your boss as well as others. Make sure you focus on the requirements of the new job, and not just that you have been good at the old job. You can mention how hard you have worked at the old job, but that should not form the basis for why you will be great at the new job. For example, if the new job is a leadership role, emphasize why you will be a great leader. If the new job is about collaborating with other stakeholders, emphasize your skills in that area. If the new job is about hiring, training, and growing a team, indicate how you have done that well in the past. Avoid any mention of favoritism, or "the other guy". That just makes you look weak. Remember that the other guy's "only skills are that he is friends with the boss" is your conclusion, and may not be shared by others. 

You apologize (in person), indicate that you have learned a lesson, indicate that the offending tweets have already been taken down, and that you won't do it again. In the future, you talk to the CTO or HR when you have an issue, rather than commenting publicly. Everyone makes mistakes. If this is the first one, and if you don't have a habit of repeating your mistakes it will likely blow over. 

It's your family. Does anyone really care what they say about you professionally? I know for anyone I'd hire, I wouldn't care what their family said. In general, LinkedIn skills endorsements are worth almost nothing. The UI that LinkedIn pushes to people in your network begs them to click an endorsement button. No thinking is involved. This means almost everyone is endorsed for skills they don't actually possess. 

You simply have a conversation with your manager and explain that you would prefer not to have to train new hires. And you explain why. Skip any mention of "not in my job description". That would be a big mistake. Almost every job requires "and other tasks as required". And a job description is never detailed enough to mention every aspect of your job. Skip any mention that you "do not get any extra money for training". I'm assuming you are either salaried, or paid for all your hours of work. People don't get extra for performing a task that they would rather not perform. Skip the part about "catty behavior". That sounds petty. And be aware that trying to avoid doing anything "extra" likely means you'll be passed over for any promotions, and potentially any raises. If you are simply happy doing your routine job without every going outside your comfort zone, you can convey that to your manager. 

You don't put jobs (or internships) as references - you put people as references. And you should never put anyone as a reference who hasn't agreed to be one for you and who you don't feel will say good things about you. Talk with the appropriate individual at your previous internship. Ask if she/he will be a reference for you, and during your conversation, gauge if he/she will say good things about you or not. 

Approach your line manager about this additional contract since you do not want to sign it and discuss what next steps should be taken. You have been hired. You don't need to sign anything for the recruiter if you don't want to do so. 

Yes, it's certainly okay. The probationary period at most companies that employ them serves a dual purpose. They allow the company to determine the period how well you will fit in the role. But in addition, they allow you to determine over the period if the company and role meet your needs. At the end of the period, either party is free to determine that it isn't working out, and end the relationship. 

If it would make you feel better, then go ahead and write it down. But realistically, it's wasted effort. You won't know what kind of messy situation you are really getting into until you are in place for a while. At that point it will either be a good situation for you or a bad situation. And at that point you can decide to stay or leave. Writing that "I will re-evaluate my position" does nothing - other than perhaps antagonize your employer unnecessarily. You can re-evaluate at any time, for any reason. 

How about walking into his office and saying "Boss, do you have a minute to chat?" Then, you sincerely apologize for offending him, and discuss the situation so you reach an understanding about why he was offended, and how you can avoid such a situation in the future. Many times, just talking with the party involved is the first step to understanding. This is one of those times. Additionally, apologies should almost always be delivered personally, rather than via email, whenever it's practical to do so. We convey a lot in our tone, attitude, body language, etc - all of that is lost when using emails. You may have delivered a written text, but not actually conveyed a real apology. 

Unless you are seeking a profession that requires an advanced degree or certification, then - Yes, that is indeed the fear. 

For me, it would seem likely to be a waste of time. It isn't obvious what your goal in approaching the CTO would be. Certainly you can't expect to change the company's mind and have them go back to the previous benefit plan because it now costs you more. Perhaps you just want to express your displeasure. You could certainly do so, and perhaps that might help in thinking over future changes, but it seems unlikely. Perhaps you want to discuss the overall corporate culture and make a decision if it still fits your personal needs or not. That's not unreasonable - just tread carefully so that the choice to depart is yours. The nature of startups is that pretty much everything changes rapidly. That isn't comfortable for everyone.
