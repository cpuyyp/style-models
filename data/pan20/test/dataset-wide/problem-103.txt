I'm uncomfortable putting "nano-tech" and "melee weapon" in the same sentence for the same reason I don't think nuclear fusion handguns would catch on. Its over-designing to the point of being dangerous. That being said, saying your device works by applied magnetism could be interesting. Maybe the protagonist has a device that can fuse metal shavings into programmable shapes? That could explain the malleability without the chance of a grey goo indecent. Only downside would be turning the new shapes back into metal shavings. It would probably be easier just to throw the old shape away and make a new one from scratch. Basically I'm talking about a tools that arranges the parts (metal shavings) and fusing them together with magnetism. Or, if you want to avoid pseudo-science of super accurate and portable electromagnets, have the character carry a suitcase-sized 3d printer. The printer could scan objects, then replicate them. All it could need is to be reloaded with materials whenever it ran out. While this goes beyond the scope of the question, justifying this device in-universe could be interesting. No offence to martial artists or swordsmen, but long ranged armaments seems like the way of the future, so a hyper-advanced melee weapon is an odd tool to see. I can totally imagine a character custom ordering one for a specific task, but his mechanic/engineer would still look at him/her funny. However, the ability to get custom-made tools on the fly would be fantastic if you are a mechanic. With a machine like Budhaditya described or the gizmos I talked about, you could make wrenches of any size, parts to replace any broken ones, and any kind of tool you could imagine. Then, when the character is in trouble, they could find one of these in-universe multi-tools and program it to make simple weapons. Oh, and countering this weapon would probably best be done by shooting the character holding it with a gun or gun-adjacent object. 

Question: Is it possible or likely possible to measure pain scientifically (including assigning some numbers/unit with the same seriousness as length, time, etc.) and build machines doing that with today's technology? My starting point: Wikipedia writes "Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli." It lists different types of pain: "Nociceptive" (pain is "detected" by sensor cells), "Neuropathic" (pain as damage to the nervous system) and "Psychogenic" (basically emotional pain). Wikipedia further writes "A person's self-report is the most reliable measure of pain." and quotes Margo McCaffery: "Pain is whatever the experiencing person says it is, existing whenever he says it does". It also has a long list of pain scales which are in most cases not further explained. Wikipedia also provided scales for humans that can not communicate pain, e.g. this one. However, I don't want patients telling their pain, but measuring it independently. I image something like this could be archived with brain activity per second or something like that, if there is a pain part in the brain. Wikipedia briefly reports on that too in this section. However, the linked FMRI page doesn't contain the word "pain" and the 3 references in the section I just linked are all from 2011 and I'm not a physician, so I dare not to judge if they are affirmative to my question or just wishful thinking. I also don't know if these can measure all three parts of the pain or not. If someone with a medical background could give some evaluation on that point, this would be great. Other insightful answers to the question above are appreciated, too, of course. Background, if you need one: While I think my question above (without looking at my own research and ideas stated thereafter) is specific and general enough to be on-topic here, I'll give some background that brought me to the question in case someone is interested. I insist that this is additional information not needed for answering the question, but some may find it interesting nevertheless. Feel free to edit this part out if it isn't in the spirit of the community. In my story there is a magic that is defined to inflict the utmost pain possible on individuals, and it is of course regarded evil and forbidden. Then there is this villain (basically evil incarnate) who, as part of that universe, cannot now that this magic is per definition the worst, so he tries to beat it with other means. Cruelty ensues, but the maniac takes a scientific approach and tries to measure just how bad he can be. When the heroes finally stop the villain on his never-ending conquest, just looking at the tip of the iceberg of what he has done disgusts them so much they destroy everything without a second look. The end. (Or is it?) Sidenote: Of course I can do the measurement magically, but it seems more evil to me if the maniac actually uses scientific methods. EDIT: I decided to move further on-topic discussions to chat. 

Well, for starters, generating heat wouldn't result in any force being generated. In this set up, its not so much the heat or fire propelling your character as much as him continually making explosions. Think achieving flight by the recoil of firearms. Right off the bat, he would have to be capable of withstanding that kind of explosive force being generated right next to his body. Using explosive power has other issues for his surroundings. Generating that much force might damage this characters surroundings, but probably not too much more than a helicopter (I'm guessing that last bit. Aerodynamics is not something I know anything about). The real problem would be the noise. Having a character achieve flight by combustion would be louder than an un-muffled motorcycle and would be sure to wake the neighbors. No way he could be able to sneak up on anyone while flying. A simpler but less ideal solution is for him to heat (and cool down if possible) air in order to manufacture updrafts. Then he can make hang-gliders that never have to touch the ground or reverse-parachutes. It's very gadget-y, but would be plausible and make your character look cleaver. 

Make the Bundvark a colony type creature. Think FireAnts, Man o' War, Killer Bees. You shoot it and it causes damage, but it pissed off the rest of the swarm/smart colony. Alternatively make the Bundvark have multiple redundant organs or extreme regeneration. 

We couldn't use Jupiter's gravity as it stands without moving something. If you can move Jupiter, you can move Earth, or even better still the asteroid in question, so there wouldn't be any reason for it. Using mass to move other things via gravity is possible however. It's actually one of our plans in case we do need to move some space rocks out of our way. They call this a gravity tractor. 

Yes, there would be different cultures. Other factors would cause the cultures to diverge, like climate, flora, and fauna. Some parts of your continent will be hot, others cold, and others will have seasons. Living in a desert vs living in remote mountains of lush forests vs vast plains. Dealing with dangerous wildlife, or abundant fishing or simple lack of any real animals to hunt or raise. All these would affect how the people of that area live and how their culture develops. Natural barriers would also cause people to develop different and remain different. Large mountain ranges, massive dense forests or deadly deserts will all keep people isolated and developing their own cultures that may not mix. Assuming the rest of the world is ocean, the people by the water would develop maritime lifestyles with a bit more freedom to travel around. 

Yeah, this character might have never actually spoken to another human, depending when the superpower is activated. They are just too slow to meaningful interest with. Heck, most people probably couldn't interact with her because standing still long enough to be registered by the human eye would require a twelve hour nap on her part. If anything, areas which this character protects would basically appear haunted. A crazy blur is always happening, food and water constantly goes missing, objects move around, and beneficial things (people getting saves, bullets vanishing from criminals guns, homeless people suddenly acquire coats) happen almost at random. Unless your character leaves notes, it would take people a while to figure out what's happening. If her metabolism is three meals a second, she would be able to eat an entire grocery store in a month. And I hope she has good planning skills, cause otherwise she wouldn't be able to actually cook anything. If she can manage having a house with that kind of diet, she might appreciate hummingbirds, who STILL are crazy slow compared to her. That all sounds like an awesome concept to me, but there is a problem that does need to be solved for this plot to work: The average person lives for 27.000-ish days. That means your character's entire lifespan would be 450 minutes, or seven and a half hours. That's a heck of a short superhero career. But hey, it could be an absolutely world changing glorious seven hours. 

Because of a recent question I ended up reading through the Painkill-discussion on meta and in the linked question the_OTHER_DJMethaneMan wrote in a comment 

What defines a human? When someone lost both arms and legs and get them replaced with prostheses, he still counts as human, no? But what if he gets replaced more, so that only the head remains? Would that still count as human? Surely many would say "He is just a head!" (as they said earlier "He is just a cripple!"). Are additions to the human make the humans inhuman? When a third arm is inhuman (and people grow third arms occasionally), why isn't the sixth finger on a hand (this also happens, humans are weird)? 

Conclusion As you see, there are a lot of settings where magic, in one form or another, is known and accepted. People grew up with it in some cases, which is the easiest way to install acceptance. In other cases, magic was to big to ignore. In some cases, magic is just too strong to allow a long lasting society, if it isn't watered down in some way. 

I have a planned species of aliens that have many commonalities with longhorn crazy ants (cooperation with colonies of the same species, can live in a large variety of environments, and have the ability to have genetic variation with a low number of breeding pairs). They are humanoid bipeds with exoskeletons as well as pseudo-endoskeletons, lungs and hearts to pump blood, and regulate heat by a series of capillaries in their mouths (basically just panting like a dog). Individual physical power, as a whole, isn't that much more than a human. Socially, their "family" units consist of a female queen, a male drone, and twenty to fifty sexless workers (depending on the sub-species). Its like if an entire tribe operates as a single organism, while all having independent minds. Finally, they have the ability to cooperate with other families to form cities, nations, and empires. After a few millennia of advancement, this species took to space. My question is: what kind of home-world would this species evolve on? Even with my additions to make them environmental generalists, I got no idea how human-sized insects could exist in the first place. I would love to be able to include details about native cuisine and interesting animals they might take with them to space, but at the moment I'm stumped. 

The problem is more of a philosophical one than a legislative one (yet). If all atoms in your body are replaced one after another (this actually happens over time), are you still the same person? If your "native U.S." atoms are replaced with "non-native U.S." atoms, are you not a native U.S. citizen anymore? That would mean a U.S. citizen who lives most of his/her time out of the U.S. would at some point become non-native. While I believe that some people really think that way, this isn't currently the shared opinion in court, as I believe. Now what happens if you replace the atoms faster or larger chunks at once? Does this change the reasoning. If so, then there must be a line. The court will have to draw the line, if necessary, but it is really a blurry thing. For example, you explicitly wrote 

Given all the examples above, as a human, a simple thought comes to mind: "Wouldn't humanity be better of without magic?" Currently I think "Wouldn't humanity be better of without nuclear weapons?" This is a clear yes, but even if I would be able to make nuclear weapons undone, there is no way I could prevent people of inventing them AGAIN! Now, assume you live in a world where real magicians exist, but you don't know how they work, physically. It is not unreasonable to assume that magic may came from somewhere, but since then was genetically embodied in people. So if you would kill all people which show signs of magic, wouldn't you be able to remove magic from the world? If faced with no consequences, people can do bad things to people of other factions they don't like. If you, additionally, have no idea what magicians are capable of, you could be really worried about your world. Fear about getting attacked can make you want to attack first. So finally, in a world where magic is not widely understood and where magicians are not organized, it is likely for them to be prosecuted and blamed for all the bad things, because that's sadly how humanity works. They have to hide to survive. In other scenarios, it could work out better, as the examples above show. 

A person died long ago and their soul went to Heaven/Hell/Some ethereal plane. Somehow after years of struggle they find an escape back to the Material World. What allows that soul to have a new material body? Is it created somehow? Can it only possess another body? The world in question has magic to some extent, tho its very scientific. I want to avoid simply saying "Magic" or "Just because". Ideally it will be the "same" body as before death as far as looks and so on, but I'm not opposed a very clever possession or something. 

Make it so that they can only lift things as long as there is an anchor point to they "mind hand". You can easily lift yourself over a ledge or pull up bar. The thing is anchored to the ground and you are lifting yourself of that thing which is anchored and can support the weight. You can however stand in an open room and lift your own feet off the ground and float in mid air even though you have the strength to do so. You can't attach a rope around your waist and grab it above you and lift yourself off the ground. There has to be a point anchored to the ground that can support the thing. This still allows the character to launch themselves in the air though, but they still have to deal with falling and landing. Even if they want to abuse this constantly and jump repeatably in quick succession, therefore being "flight" you can limit the range to something that makes sense. Then the character can possibly hover buy pushing off the ground, but only to whatever range you set. This also makes it quite difficult to actually move while doing so, and you couldn't cover gaps this way either.
