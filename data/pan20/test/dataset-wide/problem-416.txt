Self-Preservation When our aliens developed FTL travel and explored the galaxy they discovered something very disconcerting. They weren't the first, but they were the only advanced civilisation left. Everywhere else, ruins. And not a clue as to how this had happened. The Marie Celeste on a galactic scale. Since this discovery they have been doing two things. Concealing their own existence to the greatest extent possible. Spreading life across the galaxy and uplifting younger races while never revealing themselves (c.f Iain Banks "Inversions"). If an unknown horror returns it'll attack these noisy younger races first, giving our aliens the maximum chance to know the enemy and to decide whether to fight it (with plenty of allies/ cannon fodder) or to quietly flee from it (hopefully un-noticed amidst the presumed chaos). 

What do you mean by unexplained? This is a serious question. One can pretty much say that the fundamental laws of the universe are those which we cannot explain. Some may later prove to be explicable in terms of more deeply fundamental laws as yet unknown. Others may remain forever inexplicable, bearing much the same relation to physics as axioms do to mathematics. So far this reductionist approach has resulted in things of technological use being explicable right down to entities so small that just accepting them as given bothers only the physicists trying to find an ultimate theory of everything which may or may not exist. Some hitherto overlooked macroscopic property of matter or energy that does not have an explanation in terms of the underlying entities seems ... unlikely. The least understood fundamental is gravity. If you have visiting aliens that implies FTL travel which is immediately an inexplicable observation. FTL breaks down into causality-violating and paradox-creating actual motion, and wormholes or jump-drives which suggest strongly that gravity is far more capable of manipulation than we believe. Speculating further: what they've accidentally left behind is a wormhole-connected interstellar access thingy. We don't understand it because it's the most accessible tip of a huge gravItic-tech pyramid like a mobile phone is the accessible tip of a global network. The bit that does the real work is ... elsewhere. Soon, we're using that tech like swallows use the telephone network. The aliens were using it like arts graduates use mobiles. The types who set their passwords to 1234. And somewhere out there, a bill will soon become payable. 

"Alien nature of the speakers" contains an assumption that may be completely unwarranted: that your aliens communicate by means of sound waves. Even here on earth, we have creatures that communicate visually, and creatures that can create complex patterns on their skins and vary those patterns at high speed (using chromatophores). So how about aliens who evolved with (an) extra eye(s) dedicated to communication, and patches of skin-like tissue on which they can form fast-moving patterns of considerable complexity? I'd hazard a guess that such communication would be far more impenetrable than a mere succession of glyphs mapping onto human words. Or even if they use sound: an ultrasonic carrier may have sufficient bandwidth to be modulated in several of the ways used by humans for radio communications. Multiple sidebands, for example. Human speech breaks down into words, with (in European languages) a non-verbal but emotional side-channel conveyed by pitch. Imagine several channels, each conveying a stream of information of similar density to speech, with meaning conveyed via their inter-relationships rather than each as a unit. Being able to appreciate every note and harmony in a Bach fugue might get you as far as one of their babies. back on Earth: we're still unable to talk to dolphins. Are they just not that intelligent (ie less intelligent than great apes, African Grey parrots, and domesticated dogs)? Many observations suggest otherwise. What other wild animals not only have sufficient empathy to realize that another species (humans) are in trouble in the water and need help, but also enough intelligence to know that to help them these "aliens" have to be assisted back to land, a place where dolphins cannot go and the margins of which are perilous to the rescuers. My own guess is that they do have language, and it is sufficiently alien that we can't map their language onto ours. 

You need to be aware that four million years is significant in geological time. Ground level is not constant. In some places the ground is rising and in others it us falling. Human artifacts that are forced up will be weathered away over mere tens of millennia. Where ground level falls they will be buried and possibly preserved, but the burial may be a lot deeper than you expect. Almost everywhere, deeper than primitives will dig. Consider London, which is sinking. The streets of Roman London are three to six meters below today's. Say two meters per millennium. Over a few million years that adds up to many kilometers. So four million years hence there will be very little if any of our civilization visible at ground level. A pre-industrial people probably will not detect any sign that they are not the first people. Only when they start deep mining on an industrial scale and start a scientific study of geology will they notice our remains. The very occasional finds of technological fossils will probably be attributed to ancient gods or mythical civilisations like our Atlantis lying in the relatively recent past. I expect initial discoveries will be hugely disputed, just as the existence of deep time, geological movement and drifting continents were fiercely disputed well into the 20th century. Will their attainment of our levels of technology by hastened by the eventual mapping out of fossil cities? I doubt that anything would be well enough preserved to significantly advance their development. At this remove of time it would be far easier to see what we built, than how we built it. 

I'm sure it's possible. The trick would be to have a substance that is very hard for a human body to excrete, whicb will slowly be metabolised from latent poison to active and cumulative poison. The antidote accomplishes what your body can not: it converts the poison into something harmless. Prozac has a half-life of several weeks in your body, but of course it slowly metabolises into harmless things. It's proof of concept though. There is a non prescription painkiller which nearly fits the bill: Paracetamol. In normal doses it is metabolised by your liver into a toxin and then immediately re-metabolised into something harmless. In overdose your liver runs out of an amino acid needed for the second stage and then inflicts potentially fatal damage because the first stage doesn't stop. The antidote is acetylcysteine. Take enough of that before your liver destroys itself and you will survive, possibly even without noticeable toxic effects. Wait too long and you'll die many days later. Personally I don't think the stuff should be non prescription. Every year people take an overdose, fall asleep, wake up, feel Ok, feel glad their suicide failed, tell nobody, get on with life, and die horrible deaths a couple of weeks later. It's perfectly safe in normal doses though. Edit. I'll add that it's quite possible that the substance is known in the archives of a pharmaceutical company dating back to before predicting the metabolism of a novel compound in a body was a science. Something that worked in the short term and then made the lab rats die.
