Thanx to all users, who had given their valuable suggestions. what i had concluded that to boost up my enthusiasm during work, as suggested by @karl beilefeldt 

Bravo.! That's really a brave question. Its a problem that i think many of us should have faced. The question to this is simple. As you have mentioned, there are only 8 or 9 employees in your office, that means your absence in the office will definitely affect the work. Also, you have mentioned that you are feeling quite better and the disease is not much severe and you will be fine in 2 or 3 days, so you might talk to your boss about the disease and ask him to decrease the workload from you. Even working in weekends for completing the work might do the trick. But all depends on how you presents your illness to your boss. but i must say Never Compromise anything for the Sake of you HEALTH 

Note- I work in IT company, so you could understand a break's value for a programmer. I work in a company with a 4 floor setup and about 200 employees in the same building, though it is quite a large company with employees in trades other than IT. 

Social Networking sites are blocked in our office. So whenever i am free at work, i usually spend much of my time studying my previous assignments, researching about enhancements in the technology on which i am working upon and most of the time in Stack overflow solving others problem. I think its among the best ways to learn about things. But also, you need to find out the reason, why you are not being assigned work, sometimes these reasons could be severe. 

Few candidates actually ask for a higher salary, and I suppose shyness, and fear of appearing greedy, are the major reasons for this. However, you should definitely try to negotiate as high a salary as you can, when you first join your job. This is your most significant chance to try to earn more. But directly asking for I want more money is not good, instead justify yourself to be paid more money. find or develop a role which commands a higher value, and therefore salary. You can do this either and both with your present employer by agreeing wider responsibilities and opportunities for you to contribute to organisational performance and profit, and/or perhaps with a new employer. 

If you are looking to get permanent in the office, you should definitely focus on improving your relationships with your fellow colleagues as well as your seniors. Going to a trip with them is really a good option for this. Also if letting down half day salary is not gonna cost you much, then you should definitely attend the trip. Also, talking to your senior about working for extra hours to make up for the trip time will definitely show your loyalty towards work and also your half day salary would be saved. So you should definitely go to trip and ask your senior to make up for the half day loss by working in extra hours. 

I can think of my 2 college friends, who were always together, even when they go for interviews for jobs. They were categorised as couples by our other friends. At last, they broke their friendship. I also have somewhat same scenario as did you, but not this much sever(I am not always with the female friends, even prefer to hang out with my male friends most of the time). I would like to mention few things as said by you, We frequently have chats Now, I would like to mention my scenario. I do have female friends, even I do have daily chats with some of my female friends. I cant remember a single day when we havnt talked. Also with one of my friends, I do have late night conversations. We are best friends and we think its normal among the friends to have frequent chats. We are always together Now about your second point. Whenever, we are together, we are not always alone. and I dont think a purpose of always being alone all the time. We are always in a group. We often go for lunch Now, about the third point. We do go for outings and watch movies. but here also we are in a group 

Search engines can help you. Google has tools to help you do this. I don't think Google is blocked in Hong Kong, but if it is you can always use a Chinese search engine like Baidu to similar effect. Google offers an option to display only results from Hong Kong (enter search terms, hit enter, tools menu, country selection). If you have a Google account you can also specify which languages you want results in, so limit it to English. Then search for English terms like "jobs" and "english speaking". When I tried this I saw several sites such as www.indeed.hk and jobsinhongkong.com that are dedicated to English speaking users, and have options to filter by jobs that accept English-only applicants. Similarly, you can search for phrases like "location hong kong". Combined with "careers" or "recruitment" that seems to turn up a few employers with offices there. 

Send them another message giving a date for the end of your employment. State clearly that you will cease to work for them after that date. Make sure you have evidence that it was received, e.g. registered mail or email reading receipt. That's all you need to do. If they fail to act it's their problem. Concentrate on your next job. 

Unfortunately it can be difficult to determine before hand what the company's reaction will be, and especially in larger companies it can depend which department you are in. One useful technique is to look for or ask for copies of their policy on disabilities and medical conditions. If they don't have a policy that's probably a bad sign. Beyond that it's best to wait until they have shown interest in you. Depending on the severity of your condition you might be able to do interviews and progress quite far before it becomes an issue. Once they are seriously considering you as a potential employee it is easier to simply tell them about your condition, explain what support or adaptations you will need, and ask if they feel that is okay. It does potentially waste some of your time, but telling them up front before they actually know you and understand that it's not something scary or debilitating might get you nowhere. And of course, you have to be willing to walk away if it doesn't seem right. 

You should avoid sharing your current salary details. It can only ever work against you. All that information will be used for is to calibrate the offer they make you to be as low as possible while still tempting you away from your current job. This punishes people who are loyal (switching jobs often usually increases salary faster than yearly raises) and who are underpaid. Remember that stating your current salary is the start of your salary negotiation. They will likely offer you around 10% more as a starting point. Its in your best interest not to start with a low number like that and try to work up, justifying a larger increase. You should give them your desired salary for the company in question, which will depend on location (cost of living/rent), type of work and what non-monetary benefits they offer. 

What you really want to know is if family friendly policies will result in undue burden on yourself. Assuming you don't have some strange notion of "fairness" in not wanting parents to look after their children properly, your real concern is the effect on you. You can ask companies directly about this. Simply state that in the past you have been overloaded or distracted by these policies, and would like to know how this company deals with them. Seeking out companies that don't have a family friendly policy could easily backfire - if they don't give parents basic support, what other kinds of poor working conditions do they have? Do they account for every minute of your day, are the inflexible when you need unexpected extra time off for some reason (e.g. sick relatives, funerals etc)? 

You could potentially be the person to take this shambles and apply some structure, and that would look great to future employers. Don't worry about people doubting your skillset, and whether or not you really did do X, Y and Z. Just focus on being actually good at those skills, and you will always be employable. 

Do you use any enterprise chat applications such as Hipchat or Slack? On a project I am working on, we have a standup channel on Slack (used Hipchat in the past) in which, after each days standup, we summarize what we are going to be working on that day (basically typing out what we said in the standup). You could implement something like this, and have every member of your team including your boss do this as part of their routine. This way you know your boss is reading everybodys messages every day, and if you summarize incorrectly he can tell you at the time. Then a week later, if your boss claims you were working on something not asked for you can point to your entry from a week ago, and ask why this wasn't raised with you at the time. I prefer this to email as it's more casual, easier to work into a routine and generally feels more natural. 

I've been there myself, having missed work as a result of mental health issues. The important thing to realize is that it is very difficult for people who have no experience with psychiatric disorders (either not having experienced them themselves or through a family member) to empathize with those who do. To them it just looks like laziness/slovenliness etc and how can you expect them to tell the difference? Now that you're feeling better, the best thing for you to do is to work hard and kick ass at whatever it is that you do. Being able to overlook remarks such as this is a sign of good mental health. 

That's a red flag right there. It implies that while the office is busy, things are either too distracting for you to be able to focus or you have more work than you can handle, so you need to stay late to get things done. This suggests that management aren't doing a good enough job at either managing your workload or providing a productive working environment. Regardless of whether or not this is actually true, this is how it would look to me, and I would draw conclusions about the competency of your managers as a result. Besides, surely there are better ways to be spending your free time? Go to the gym? Meetups? The pub? 

Don't do this either. If you are really that curious, just bring it up in your second interview. You clearly gave enough correct answers that they want to interview you again. If you were giving those answers of the top of your head, it isn't that surprising that you wouldn't remember what the questions actually were. If somebody asked you where a particular street was on your way to work this morning, and you instantly knew the answer, you would be hard pressed a day or so later to remember that street. I think the same principle applies here. If, in the course of an interview, you are asked about something which you know really well, it's not unreasonable to think that you will go into autopilot and not really think about your answer, but still give the correct answer, and it wouldn't be a memorable event later on.
