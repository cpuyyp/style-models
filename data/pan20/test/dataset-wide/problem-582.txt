I do trail riding with some technical elements, and I have decided to upgrade my normal helmet to some sort of a full-face helmet. I have seen some sturdy-looking helmets, which resemble the motorcycle ones (example). However, their ventilation looks bad, so I don't want these. I am interested in the lighter variant, which looks like a normal helmet with a chin guard attached to it (example) - chin guard may or may not actually be removable. So, if I get the latter type of helmet, do I get significantly better protection, comparing to non-full-face helmets? Specifically, will it protect me from a direct face-plant? Is there a significant risk of the chin guard snapping and hurting me? Does it matter if the chin guard is made of metal or plastic? 

I have accidentally removed the suspension fork from my bicycle (Trek Remedy 8). I was trying to take off just the handlebar, but was distracted for a moment and unscrewed the wrong bolt. How safe would it be to assemble it back without going to my LBS (it will probably take them some much time, and I would not like to miss riding on my weekend)? I have no experience in suspension fork servicing; my idea is just to use common sense to screw parts back in. It doesn't seem that the fork has any ball bearings. 

My problem is, when I am riding, they sometimes slip down, reducing protection of my knees. This mostly happens because of vibration, while I am riding down (it's when I need them the most), but sometimes also when I am pedaling up. If I fall down when my guards have slipped, it's as if I had no protection at all. I noticed that on some days I get lucky with my straps and they sort of "stick" to my legs and don't move, while on other days I constantly readjust them, and they slip all the time. How can I fix this problem? I am willing to buy a different type of guards if that would solve my problem (however, I don't want soft/flexible guards - plastic has better protection). 

Also, on a fixed gear, the length of your crank could be important : If you're taking a tight corner, you might lean over far enough that the bottom of the crank scrapes the road as the pedal turns, which can lead to a wreck. You can get a crankset that has shorter arms to avoid this, though if you're not into tight cornering it might not be a problem. It's something to be aware of though, since you never really know when you might need to pull an emergency maneuver. Other stuff Once you've gotten the rear wheel and drivetrain set up, you're technically good to go. You can opt to switch many other things on your bike, but chances are that it already has a seat, headset, fork, handlebars, etc. 

On my tour across the US, I bought a statewide gazetteer at a gas station whenever I entered a new state, and then threw away all the pages that I wasn't planning on going through. I kept the rest in a pannier, inside a large ziplock freezer bag to keep them dry. Whenever I stopped for a snack (about every couple of hours), I'd pull out the page where I was and look ahead for the next couple hours -- usually this would only be a few turns to remember (or none, in Montana). At dinner I would pore over the map from that day and for the next day to regroup mentally and plan for what was coming up. It probably depends on your comfort level with your "sense of direction" and where you are touring, but in most places without a ton of roads it's surprisingly easy to find your way around -- you just take the road that heads west/north/whatever. 

Fantastic ! Building a fixed gear conversion is a lot of fun. tommy_o gives a great list of all the parts that go on a conversion, but when I try to imagine what it's like to have an old bike that you want to hack on, I think it's helpful to imagine what you'll have to change about your bike, so I'll give that a shot. As long as the existing bike is in decent shape, you actually have a lot of freedom in deciding whether to get new parts or reuse existing ones. At a minimum, though, you'll need a new rear wheel, and then from there it gets more and more up to you. Wheel You can either buy a wheel, or build one yourself. I've found that buying is actually cheaper, but I think it's a good exercise to build at least one yourself to see how it's done. Either way, like tommy_o mentioned, you'll need to pay attention to the size of the rim that you want to get. If your bike has 27" wheels and you decide to get a 700c rear replacement, then you'll need to be ok with having different size wheels, or you'll also need to get a new front wheel. If you decide to build, you'll need to buy : 

I imagine the last idea, with resting the bike on the backpack, is the only usable one for long sections (say, 30-60 minutes walking). Am I right? Which way can I secure my bike on my backpack, so the back ache (and supposedly damage) is minimized? 

The problem is, when keeping the pedals horizontal, I always ride with my left foot ahead of the right one (like the guy on the picture does). When I turn left (like in the picture), everything is OK. But when I turn right, the saddle gets in the way (you can imagine it by looking at the picture - if he turned right, the saddle would push his right leg out of place). What can I do about it? The following works but is not ideal: 

Increase the pressure in your tires (this was mentioned in comments). This will make it less comfortable, but will decrease rolling resistance. Also, try to optimize your route from a commuter's point of view: use smooth roads where possible. And if there are significant changes in height on your route, try to optimize them too. 

Sometimes I want to ascend a steep (say, 50%) slope, where is impossible to ride and awkward to push/pull the bike. I tried various ways of carrying the bike: 

One important advantage of 1x11 gearing is the improved clearance of the front chainring. In technical riding, the largest cog would strike stones as you are riding over them. This happened to me all the time until I removed it (I have 2x10 now). Another advantage is reduced weight and mechanical complexity - if you have just one front cog, you don't need a front derailleur, and the corresponding shifting mechanism and its cable are not needed. 

As the end of the ski season is approaching, I am thinking about visiting our ski resort by bicycle. I would like to do it at the end of the season to avoid the inconvenience of the crowd, and minimize the inconvenience I would make for others. In the ski resort we have, it is pretty unusual to have bicycles. The chairs don't have any hooks or other appliances to hold bicycles, and the crew might not be able (or willing) to help. In these circumstances, how can I ensure safe and smooth boarding and disembarking? I will be in a small group (2-4 people), all of us having standard (non-fat) mountain-bikes. I am willing to do basic disassembly (e.g. remove wheels) if it would help. Our ski-lifts have standard chairs, designed for 2 persons (like in this example picture); they are not of the type that slows down when in the boarding/disembarking area. 

I've noticed that getting repeat punctures can simply be a sign that your tires are past their useful lifespan. I went on a long tour and had no flats for weeks on end, but then once my touring tires passed the 2000 mile mark, I got two flats in two days. I replaced my tires and had no flats again for weeks on end, and again when the tires passed the 2000 mile mark I got a couple flats in as many days. My story is only a couple of data points, but there does seem to be some consensus that tires simply wear out after a fixed distance -- though that distance depends on make, air pressure, rider weight, etc., see here and here. 

For riding in the rain, I would definitely recommend putting fenders on your bike that cover as much of the wheel as possible. This will help prevent "skunk stripes" on the back of your clothes due to dirt thrown up by the rear wheel. Fenders also generally help keep water from flying all around during riding, which keeps other things from getting as wet to begin with. I'd also recommend putting a plastic cover on your seat, as (a) wet seats tend to stay wet for a long time, and (b) keeping your seat dry will help extend its usable lifetime. For this, you can simply tie a plastic grocery bag over the seat -- it's not very elegant looking, but it works well as long as there aren't any holes in the bag. Make sure the bottom of the seat is covered as well as the top. For the drive train, it's difficult to keep this part of the bike dry during rainy weather. You could look into getting a chain guard, but these are typically designed to prevent dirt and grease from the chain rubbing onto your leg or pants, not to keep the chain dry in the rain. It might help keep rain off from above, but it won't help keep things dry from below. You might also prophylactically keep your drivetrain dry by using a wax-based chain lubricant before you go out in the rain. This will help repel water during the ride. 

I might need to replace my rims soon. I've had frequent problems with breakage of spokes, so it's a good opportunity to buy stronger rims and/or spokes. What characteristics should I look for if I want to fix this problem? Should I pay attention more to the spokes or to the rim? Some details: I don't do racing, so weight is not an issue. I do trail riding, including jumps. I have disk brakes. 

I have experienced a strange failure of my brake. I was descending a steep smooth road, using only my front brake (my rear brake was broken; it was an unplanned bail from a route). I tried keeping the speed low, so i could jump off the bike at any moment. After going this way for maybe 2 minutes, I stopped briefly to let some car pass (so released the brake for a few seconds). As I continued to descend, I pressed the brake, and surprisingly, its handle went all the way to the handlebar without doing any braking! So I immediately jumped off. I didn't believe at first the bad luck I had, but then I pressed again and again on the brake (not while riding now), and gradually it returned to normal; after 1 minute it would give full braking force again. So I wonder, is this an expected way a brake would fail while overheating? I heard that it would start to stink really bad before it became dangerous to ride, so I didn't worry about overheating. The model of my brake is Hayes Nine. 

I am practicing the technique of cornering, where one must lean the bicycle into the turn, while keeping the body more or less vertical. A (possibly exaggerated) picture I found on Google: 

Update: I had a half-full 35-litre backpack at the day I had this problem. I am willing to fill my pack with light bulky stuff if needed, but I don't want a bigger pack: 35 L seems enough for maximal journeys I want to do; any bigger and it starts to be annoying.
