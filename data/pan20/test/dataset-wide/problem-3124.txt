Upper Valais speaks a German dialect because it was extensively settled by Germanic immigrants during the Middle Ages. At the time, Switzerland in general was being gradually infiltrated by Germans. Upper Valais, specifically, was settled by German speaking colonists from Bern. 

Political expediency. A common, populist explanation is that Aurangzeb Alamgir was religiously conservative, as taninamdar has noted. However, this is certainly not the whole picture. Though his personal religious outlook may well have been an underlying bias, political considerations were at least equally important reasons for Aurangzeb's policies - if not the driving motivation. 

No. Japan had almost no capability to continue waging war. In fact, strangled by the American blockade, Japan was tottering on the brink of collapse. Experts both then and since believed that the combined pressure of the Soviet entry, the relentless blockade (and usually, the conventional aerial bombardment campaign) would have compelled Japan to surrender. The only real question is when. 

The message was clearly received in Washington D.C., where American leadership were no more eager to fight the Chinese against. The United States thus undertook to avoid crossing that line. 

In this period, the Mongols had a nominal strength of around 100,000 to 130,000. According to the Secret History of the Mongols, Ghengis Khan had an army of 105,000 strong by A.D. 1206. This number grew to 129,000 by A.D. 1227, according to Rashid-al-Din_Hamadani in his Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh. Of the latter figure, 27,000 were new units raised from Manchuria. If we assume the rest were "Mongolian", then: 

As the notes show, the idea of the judiciary exercising the power of judicial review was so natural to the delegates, that they simply assumed it will be included in the as-yet unwritten Constitution. Rufus King plainly stated that judges will strike down unconstitutional laws. Elbridge Gerry even cited this happening (testifying to the fact that judicial review was an established operation, as I discussed earlier). Gouverneur Morris stands out from the other two by not even limiting the exercise of this judicial power by the confines of the constitution. On 21 July, James Wilson reintroduced a proposal to link the judiciary to the executive for approving Congressional legislation. This sparked in the most extensive debate on this subject in the convention. As the delegates argued over the wisdom of having judges review legislation (as opposed to waiting for cases to review the law), both those who were for and against the proposal mentioned judicial review. 

Tellingly, even after the war Japan tethered on the brink of starvation for several years. Despite renewed access to imports and the massive logistical support of the Americans, Japan still could not adequately feed itself in a time of peace. Had the blockade kept up (not to mention Soviet invasion and Allied bombing campaigns), the picture would have been far more bleak. 

The Guardian article cited in the OP actually lists seven years where a retroactive award happened for the Literature Prize: 1915, 1919, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1936 and 1949. For instance, William Faulkner was awarded his 1949 Nobel in 1950. One possible reason for 1935's omission may be that the Nobel Committee had been considering Roger Martin du Gard, for his novel sequence Les Thibaults. However, he was writing a seventh volume at the time, and perhaps this caused the Committee to delay a decision. As it happens, l'Été 1914 was published in November 1936 - too late to be considered that year. Du Gard went on to receive his Nobel in 1937. 

It's not a difference in timelines, official or otherwise. The discrepancy results from whether you count King John the Good (the King of France) as Burgundy's duke when the duchy reverted to the crown between 1361-3. The previous duke, John's stepson Philip I, died without issue in 1361. John created his youngest son, Philip II, as the new duke in 1363. For some reason the English Wikipedia includes John II of France in the numbering of Burgundian dukes. Apparently the French Wikipedia does not. Since Philip II's successor John I/II/??? is traditionally known as John the Fearless anyway, this minor discrepancy is not that consequential. It is safe to say that John the Fearless is predominantly identified by his nickname. Where regnal numbers are used, he has been referred to as both the first and the second. However, both are extremely rare. This indicates that the Wikipedia discrepancy is less an issue of English vs French as much as it is two obscure ways of referring to the same historical character. 

As you can see, the design consists of two trefoils (i.e. clovers), growing from a trimount (i.e. a mount of three hillocks), on a blue blackground. The crossed-seven-esque sign in gold appears to be a hausmarke. The trefoils are a symbol for perpetuity. As a side note, green shamrocks are also symbol device of Ireland (often depicted with heart-shaped petals). While not the case here, they are particularly common in the crests of emigrant Irish families, symbolising their ancestral home. The trimount straightforwardly represents three mountains, and has also been interpreted to symbolise the Holy Trinity. It is a relatively common element in Swiss heraldry, which may represent Mont Blanc, the Eiger, and the Matterhorn. But the design is also found in the rest of Europe, for instance on the arms of Slovakia where it symbolises the Tatra, the Fatra, and the Mátra. In fact, the arms of Sigriswil, where the family was in, also features the trimount: 

Overall however, forced sati was probably not common. Travellers to the Mughal Empire recorded many instances of widows determined to commit sati, including cases where they committed suicide in less dramatic ways when denied permission. At the same time, however, if a widow consented to sati, it seemed she would not be allowed to back out of it when the moment came. The English traveller Nicholas Withington wrote for instance that the widow's own parents would bind her and throw her back into the fire: 

The reality is that, despite the glorification of guerrilla resistance, they were simply not a huge factor in the war. Partly this is because, after the painful lessons of the Hundred Regiments Offensive, the Communists learnt to hold back on fighting. It is also partly because Japan did not have truly vital interests in the region to justify and motivate a comprehensive effort. 

The legal situation was not as clear as the question assumes, because neither of the reasons cited were valid at the time. While people often apply Salic Law to the dispute in 1328, this is ahistorical - Salic Law had long been defunct by then. Royal succession was not fixed in legislation, but instead shaped by customs that had evolved over the centuries.
