Have you considered something in retail? Best Buy has Geek Squad. Apple stores has Genius Bar. I'm sure there are others, and smaller retailers may have even more of the attributes you indicate. You can just show up and punch a clock in and out. You could get to work with people more and in front of a screen somewhat less. You don't have to bring work home with you. You won't drain much creative energy. And the pay will certainly not be too high. Alternatively, consider switching to more of a Help Desk Technician role. In some companies, you would have plenty of people contact, and far less responsibility. My son held that position part-time in his High School and then his University at one time. Lots of walking around fixing printers and such. It didn't fit his idea of a career, but it was a good solid job and didn't tax his creative energy. (He was able to complete a lot of homework, while waiting for the next task.) And if you become an independent contractor, you can pick and choose all of your gigs, and find ones that meet your personal needs regarding more people contact, less screen time, not spending too much of your creative energy and not bringing work home. 

I suppose you could admit that you have already accepted an offer that may fall through and ask if they could keep the job open until you know for sure. Seems unlikely to me, but you never know. The other option would be to decline the offer from B. Tell them something like "I've already committed to another company, otherwise I would have loved to work with you. Maybe we can get together some time in the future." Then if company A falls through, get back to company B quickly and ask if the job has been filled yet. If they liked you enough, and if not too much time has passed, your offer may still be open. I once was looking for a new job and turned down an offer. I got laid off from my company about a week later. That afternoon I called, and the job was still available, so I accepted. (My original instincts about the job turned out to be correct and the job sucked. I didn't stay long - but that's another story.) 

You are better served by always using the full URL, rather than a shortened one. Remember, some people will be reading your resume from a piece of paper. The longer URL gives the reader more visual clues as to its contents. The shorter URL does not. Similarly, even when viewing your resume online, many readers won't click every link you include to find the target site. Always either describe the target fully, or include the full URL. 

You indicate that "not much productive is going to happen in the last three-quarters of the hour", but that's something you can change. Being "spent" is a matter of opinion, not fact. Even if you are tired, there are productive things that you can accomplish - ask your boss to suggest tasks that can be successfully completed in a tired state. 

You simply say something like "Hey, X. Remember that book you borrowed from me? Well, I'm leaving the company soon and I'd like to get it back. Can you bring it in tomorrow?" And you keep repeating it until you get the book. If that fails, you could always say "Perhaps you'd prefer to keep that book and I can buy a new one. I paid $X for it. Give me that and keep the book." 

I'm not sure it matters if you plan to leave in 3 weeks after working one way for 6 months. But if it does - just ask for what you want. I'm not sure I'd expect a complete change of their contractor policies, but if it's important to you, the only way it could happen is by asking for it. Make sure you are specific in what you want to do. Make sure you propose how you will measure completion of your assigned tasks. Make sure you express where you intend to work, and for how long. Then be prepared with your response if the answer is "No". 

That depends on your goals, aspirations, and the specific requirements of the industry positions that interest you. It may also depend on the financial aspects - the opportunity costs you may be giving up now versus the enhanced rewards you may expect later on. For some positions, 2 years of post-doc would be a waste of time. For others, it might be essential. Just be aware that the skills/knowledge you learn during a post-doc won't necessarily translate directly to an industry position. As you probably know, working under business pressure is often different from working in a more academic setting. 

Yes, it's reasonable to request such an informal promise. Your boss is basically saying "I'd like to promote you, but for it to be worthwhile to the company, I'd like you to promise me that you'll stick around for at least a year." If you plan to stick around for at least a year, then it's reasonable for you to make such a promise. Since this is an informal promise, and not contractual, you get to decide how much your word/promise is actually worth. If you don't care about standing by your commitments, then just accept the promotion, and if something comes up just say "I changed my mind." If you do care, then don't make a promise you won't keep. If you need to keep open the possibility of leaving within the year, just say "I can't make that promise." As @HLGEM rightly points out - it never hurts to be known as someone who will keep a promise even when it is difficult! 

No. "Never" is a long time. And there are many "someones" in this world. Human nature is such that people can choose to feel offended over anything. Unless you remain silent, it's always possible that someone will take offense. Someone may even choose to be offended by your silence in that case. If you are in a position where providing the constructive criticism is the right thing to do, then don't let your actions be deterred by over concern for offending someone. 

You have 18 years of work experience, and presumably a salary that reflects this experience. But you have little experience in iOS, and may not be able to command the salary you are currently earning. Your best bet might be to find a position where you can leverage your 18 years of experience while making the transition to iOS. Look for something in your experience domain - perhaps a company embarking on iOS for the first time. 

Many employers don't respond when an applicant won't be considered for an interview. Some send a form letter/email "thank you", but many don't even do that. I assume what you are really asking is why you don't get invited for an interview? The list of possibilities is endless, and there's no real way for anyone here to know what the actual reasons were. Here are some possibilities: 

Part of it may be true. Part of it isn't. Putting your "personality" on the CV may indeed raise the emotion of the recruiter. That would depend on how good you are at writing, and how good you are at conveying your personality. If you are a very talented, creative type, you may be able to accomplish this. But if you are like most people, you will fail. Most people aren't good enough writers. And raising the emotion of the recruiter will only increase your chance at acceptance, if the emotion is positive. There are many, many other emotions that could be raised - anger, disgust, puzzlement, dismissal, etc. These emotions would almost certainly decrease your chance of acceptance. In my opinion, there are only a few cases where creative, personality-driven CVs/resumes are helpful. If you are in a creative role (ad writer, artist, photographer, etc), and if you are an excellent writer - then and only then should this approach be attempted. Otherwise, let your personality come out in your interviews, rather than in your CV writing. 

Something like "Sorry. I tried to get my current company to move up my departure date. But they need me to stick to my agreed-upon notice period, since they need my help in setting up an important new project. I'm sure you understand." I'm sure they will understand and respect your professionalism. 

That would depend on your world view, the field you wish to enter, the value you place on 4 years of your time, etc - not to mention the points you are choosing to exclude. It's a pretty tough decision to make, particularly financially. In some cases, in some contexts, I imagine it could be worthwhile, particularly if there is a particular employer or field you have your heart set on that has a known bias for "name" schools. In many cases, in many contexts, it wouldn't seem to be worthwhile. But "should" is something only you can answer. 

You can always appeal the decision to management, or even ask to speak with someone further up the HR chain. Exceptions can always be granted, but seldom are. It's probably worth a try; you have nothing to lose. 

It's not really clear what you are asking. But, as best I can tell, you should handle it by leaving. You have given your notice. You have handed in your uniforms. So stop talking about it and just go. Unless you are in a locale that requires some sort of relieving letter (which you haven't indicated), nobody can demand that you continue working past your notice date. Just leave. 

You call them. You explain why you need the confirmation letter, and you explain the urgency. Ask if they can get it to you quickly, or perhaps fax it to you or attach it to an email so that you can print it. 

Part time work can be successful if both you and the company are flexible. Job Sharing - have you ever explored the possibility of hiring another part-timer to cover the hours you are giving up? Sometimes two part-timers can equal one full-timer. Changing Roles - sometimes your current role demands full-time coverage. But often there are other roles within the company (some at lesser pay rates) that don't. Changing Hours - sometimes you can cover hours that are in need of coverage by working a different schedule. Occasionally covering that need can make you valuable enough to offset the loss in total hours per week. Taking Longer - if you cut your hours, sometimes projects just take longer to complete. Sometimes that's acceptable. Only for a While - Sometimes a combination of any/all of the above is acceptable for a short period of time. 

Learn and understand how the cost of living in your new locale compares to your current locale. Do a search for "international cost of living calculator" and use some of the results to help in this comparison. That will give you an idea of what it will cost to maintain your decent quality of life. You also want to consider local laws regarding benefits in your new locale. Standard benefits might be better or worse. Additionally, look on your company's career site to see if they are posting for positions similar to yours, and what they might be offering. You might also contact others in your company who live in the new locale and learn what they are making, and what the local cost of living might be. Likely your company will be doing the same using their own data. When you get an offer, you can then go into the negotiation with some sense of what you will want to receive in your new locale. 

You are entitled to ask for anything. You may not be entitled to get it. The part you are missing is that you think you "have to lie". No, you don't. 

Basically, you cannot. That's the whole point of setting up a no-reply email address - they aren't interested in feedback. Accept that you cannot always ask "why not" in these situations. 

First, separate the "let them know I'm unhappy" from "permission to work from home". They are two different things. If you just want to express your unhappiness in order to vent, then sit down with your boss and say something like "I'm unhappy with the new policy." And as @DJClayworth indicates, explain to them why you are unhappy. Explain what benefit it had to you. Explain that it was a significant reason you took the job. If you want permission to work from home once per month, then sit down with your boss and say something like "I'd like permission to work from home once per month. How can I make that happen?" You could choose to view it as they "took" something away from you, or you could choose to view it as you had something unusual/special for a while, and now you are back to the more normal situation. It's unlikely that you expressing your unhappiness will revert the policy that was changed at the start of the year, but one never knows. Perhaps if enough employees feel similarly, you can all get together and express your unhappiness at the same time. The company could presumably rethink the policy change (although it's unfortunate that these feelings weren't expressed during the few weeks notice at the end of last year). Before you talk with your boss, get it straight in your own mind what you really want to happen here. Going in with "idk" isn't going to help you be very effective. And if you have already concluded that you must leave, then don't bother venting or asking for anything. Just find a new job (that presumably permits a 4-day work week, or something else that you consider "special"), give your notice, and leave. Benefits and perks are typically reviewed annually by most companies. While it may be disappointing that this one perk you liked was changed, you should expect that in business things do tend to change over time. You need to decide which perks are significant for you, and which are not. It's understandable that this one was very significant. (A few years back, Yahoo stopped allowing employees from working from home. Later that year, HP did the same. It was a very controversial perk change at the time and bothered many of their employees. Some decided it was time to leave. Most stayed.)
