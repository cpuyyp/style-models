Not only can rapid diet evolution happen it already has, In only a few short decades Italian Wall Lizards changed their diet from a carnivorous diet into that of a herbivore, now I know that this example is a conversion from meat to vegetation, it is explain that by only slowing the rate of digestion it was possible. If we apply this same evolutionary logic then by speeding up the digestive rate a herbivore should be able to change its diet, applying of course that it has no other choice. 

So, I have a story in which all of humanity flee's the Earth. The reason as to why they left is out of the scope of the question. After they leave, I want for the domestic house cat (or some other small cat) to develop sapience in the new human-less world, but how do I justify this? What evolutionary steps would be required to have a house cat evolve sapience? if this cannot happen, how close can I get to it? How soon? 

Digital camera tests: Use a digital camera take photos around your laboratory, house, and outside. Download copies and then send the camera forward. After you receive the camera 1 minute in the future, examine the photos side by side and look for any discrepancies. If there are any discrepancies, this means that your camera came from a divergent timeline and that your original camera was sent elsewhere. If there are no discrepancies, I suggest you repeat this test a few times with various photos from around the world, just to be certain. Maybe even sent a video forward. Sending things backwards makes my brain hurt. You could send the camera back with a note saying "take a photo, save a copy and send the camera forward", but then you would remember receiving that message in the past. You would have to promise yourself to send the camera backwards whether you remember receiving it or not, and hope that a new photo appears on the camera after you put it in the time machine. For you, no time will have passed at all, and there are a few possibilities for what your will find: a) There is no photo on the camera and you don't remember receiving a note, meaning it didn't go backwards. b) You remember the message, and there is a photo on the camera that matches the one you saved a copy of...proof that you sent the camera back to the same reality. c) You remember the note, and there is a photo that does not match the photo you have saved, meaning it could be from another multiverse. These are just the tests I can think of off the top of my head. You would probably want to do each test several times to ensure that you're absolutely positive of a non-divergent timeline. You probably would want to try sending the camera over increasing lengths of time to play with the possibility that things change more drastically over longer lengths of time. 

Now I understand that Vaults and shelters are different, but the concept and feasible is proven correct by the vaults. 

Upper part humans or Semisohominum - from Semisos meaning half and Hominum meaning human. This includes the species of; 

Genetic engineering has come a long ways now form it's humble beginnings with Dolly to artificial organs, it's only a matter of time before we are making brand new animals to use for circuses, sports or pets. Of course companies would want to patent the design they put years into making but considering that animals are infinitely complex in design how could they? Ignoring all the problems with playing god, how would the genetic engineering companies patent a biological blueprint and have it hold up in court? 

Above is the second problem. In black is your mountain range, in red is the state of Nebraska and in blue is an area of roughly equal height to you mountain range. The key here is that comparing nearby states of the blue area show that the mountain do not stop tornadoes and those mountains are higher, plus they are far away from the tornado alley of the Gulf. Will it reduce the amount of tornadoes in that area? Yes. Will they be less severe? Most likely, but they will still occur. One problem here is that your stipulation of reducing tornadoes to a bar minimum is a problem, what is the bare minimum? No tornadoes ever? A couple a year? I assume that you mean either of these. 

Vibrations Through Touch: If you want to discuss a form of communication that might be similar to speech/vocalization, but slightly more alien, one method could be "hearing" through a sense of touch. Someone can feel you blow air on them from a distance, and you can theoretically alter the scale of air you release as well as the pattern. I understand that this is almost exactly how hearing works (pushing molecules through the air in different frequencies and patterns so that our ear drums vibrate and communicate the meaning to our brains), but it seems more alien when you consider "hearing" through the sensation of touch on your skin. 

There's a beautiful wide open sky. You can shove plants into the ground and they just GROW. Clean water falls from the sky. There's so much to discover and see in nature that just can't happen in a captive environment. 

Names are important, in fact one could argue that they are as important as the people behind them. They help add feeling to the characters and likely come from a specific cultural or subcultural group. Because of this, names need to fit in with your culture or you will have one big mess, after all, would you expect a Brit to be named Hakasaru? Or a Russian named Yoruba? It is important here that the naming customs of you culture fits in with the culture, but what is the best way to go about doing this? How can I make sure that the naming customs of my culture make sense and fit in with the culture itself? All Culturally Correct Questions 

People vote, likely for candidates they agree with. You need money to run a campaign. There is a maximum campaign coverage. There winds up being only two real choices by the end 

He has Porphyria At least that's what his daughter thinks. Sunlight Porphyria is a blood disease that is commonly referred to as the "Vampire Disease". People with Porphyria have extreme responses to sunlight where their skin blisters, bubbles, and itches when they go outside. They must spend the majority of their life indoors or completely covered to avoid this. Fangs Another symptom is the tightening of skin and gums which can sometimes make Porphyia patients appear to have enlarged teeth or fangs (WARNING: The hyperlinked image is GRAPHIC!!!). Garlic (and other foods) Porphyria also can cause strange allergic reactions or onset nausea to some foods. Garlic is one of these. People with Porphyria have to be very careful with their diet, because some foods can aggravate their symptoms. Garlic, in particular, can make people with Porphyria experience extreme pain or nausea. The vampire in your story could excuse himself from most meals by simply stating that he doesn't want to experience any negative symptoms. Mirrors People with Porphyria can have an aversion to mirrors because the disease makes them look so unlike themselves. Your character may look relatively normal, but you could explain that he doesn't keep any mirrors in the house because he can't stand the sight of himself. When he goes outside, he could wear a wrap or something around his head for the dual purpose of protecting himself from sunlight, and trying to keep his "disgusting" appearance from his neighbors. This would keep him from appearing in any reflections in front of his daughter. Additional Porphyria can cause patients to have red or purple urine which is where the "blood drinking theory" originated. Apparently, in the old days, people with Porphyria actually would sometimes drink animal blood to treat their anemia. Porphyria is a genetic disease but it doesn't usually reveal itself until a patient is in their late teens or early twenties. This could explain why the daughter hasn't shown symptoms yet, but could in the near future. This is an extremely rare disease, and is the origin of the Vampire Legend. I know a couple of people who have this disease, and it is awful. However, it would be the perfect cover for an actual vampire. 

I have talked about collective consciousness. The basic run down is that a collective consciousness species replaces cells, tissues and organs with ants, specialized ants and groups of specialized ants (or really any small colony animal; termites, bees, wasps, etc). A large problem with this design is that they are basically immortal, the 'cells' simply are able to endlessly reproduce, allowing the creature as a whole to never age. There is also the problem that since the creature is made of many other small creatures, I cannot think of a way for them to reliably die of unnatural causes either. This of course creates the problem that overpopulation would be reached very, very quickly. So, how can I avoid this species overpopulating their world? How can I make sure that they are guaranteed to die eventually without involving aging? 

Planets are AWESOME My best guess is that people would only want to colonize planets if other solar systems if they have already successfully colonized planets in this solar system. If they've been floating around in the asteroid belt for long enough, they will have had the time to go ahead and terraform Mars. If Mars has been terraformed, then they will have discovered that living on planets is AWESOME! 

Being able to scale (they could run hotter or cooler). Being effective in night or day (you can see through an infrared lens in night or day scenarios) Having a variety of precise and distinct characteristics within their "language" (variances in heat patterns) Working over significant distances (you can see heat traces through infrared from far away and through some barriers) 

The Crazy Gene So, if your humans have indeed terraformed Mars, and some of them live there...they might get the bright idea to try it on another planet in another solar system. Humans possess a gene, let's call it the crazy gene, that makes us want to venture out into the unknown and discover more. In The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Colbert, Colbert outlines that this gene is what set us apart from the rest of the prehistoric humans and led Homo Sapiens to conquer the Earth. Everyone wants to be in a history book Everyone wants to be the first person to discover/colonize/write about something. The tantalizing ability to be the first people to live on a new planet in a new solar system and go down in history is motivation enough to want to live on a new planet. Couple that with the fact that Mars already has been terraformed and its original settlers are revered as historical gods, and you'll get some volunteers right off to settle a new colony. SCIENCE Finally, think of the scientific possibilities. If you have a fleet of space stations, then you probably have a decent amount of humans and a decent amount of them are scientists. The reason that anyone goes to the space station right now is to perform experiments (most are zero-gravity experiments). Imagine the situation is reversed and there is the opportunity to live on a PLANET and perform experiments around the clock without the need for artificially simulated conditions. Many scientists would beg to go to a planet's surface and experiment with the atmosphere, magnetic fields, and gravity. They could even possibly discover a quicker method of terraforming. THAT genius would go down in history for sure.
