I can easily show that $H_{et}^1(X,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ is finite. For example, it follows from the Leray spectral sequence that $H_{et}^1(X,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}) \to H_{et}^1(U,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ is injective, and the latter group is finite by a special case of [1, Proposition II.7.1]. If $n$ invertible on $X$, then the answer is yes and this is again a special case of [1, Proposition II.7.1]. So I'm interested in the case where $n$ is not invertible on $X$. (In particular, this shows that $H_{et}^2(U,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ is finite). If $\dim X = 1$ then the answer if yes by [1,Theorem II.3.1]. Another application of the Leray spectral sequence argument shows that is suffices to show that $H^0(X, R^1j_* \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ is finite, but I don't see why this should be the case. The analogous question concerning finiteness of $H_{et}^i(X,\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})$ is also interesting, but for my application I only need $i = 2$. 

Let $k$ be a field with algebraic closure $\bar k$. Assume that $k$ is perfect and not of characteristic $2$ for simplicity. Let $$X: \quad Q(x)=0, \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k,$$ be a non-singular quadric hypersurface over $k$. Then it is well-known that $X\times_k \bar k$ is birational to some projective space, with the birational map given by stereographic projection. My question is whether some analogue of this holds over $k$. Namely 

I'm trying to understand better the relative Picard functor, as defined, for example, in Kleiman's article. Let $X \to S$ be a smooth projective morphism of schemes whose geometric fibres are integral. Let $$\mathrm{Pic}_{X/S}(T) = \mathrm{Pic}(X_T)/\mathrm{Pic}(T)$$ denote the relative Picard functor of $X$, with sheafications $$\mathrm{Pic}_{X/S,Zar} \quad \mbox{and} \quad \mathrm{Pic}_{X/S,et}$$ for the Zariski and etale topology, respectively. Kleiman shows that $\mathrm{Pic}_{X/S}(S) \neq \mathrm{Pic}_{X/S,et}(S)$ in general, e.g. when $X$ a conic over a field without a rational point. My question concerns what happens for $\mathrm{Pic}_{X/S,Zar}$. 

Note that $C$ is clearly a smooth curve of genus $0$ in this case. The answer to the analogue of my question is no for del Pezzo surfaces of degree $8$. Take $S = C \times C'$ where $C$ and $C'$ are conics without rational points. Then $S \to C$ is a conic bundle, but there is no conic bundle $S \to \mathbb{P}^1$. For cubic surfaces, however, the answer is yes. A cubic surface with a conic bundle contains a line and thus a rational point. Hence the base of the conic bundle is always $\mathbb{P}^1$. I'm guessing that the answer to my question is no, but I don't see how to construct explicit counter-examples. Note that a similar argument to the cubic surface case shows that such a counter-example must have no $0$-cycle of odd degree. 

Let $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ be a Noetherian local ring. If $I$ is an ideal of $A$, then by (a weak version of) the Artin-Rees lemma, there exists $j \geq 0$ such that for all $i \geq j$, $$\mathfrak{m}^i \cap I \subseteq \mathfrak{m}^{i-j} I.$$ Question: Can we choose $j$ such that the above inclusion holds with $I = \mathrm{Ann}_A(a)$ for all $a \in A$? 

Let $G$ be a connected algebraic group defined over a field $E$ of characteristic $0$. Suppose $G$ reductive $E$-split and let $T \subset G$ a maximal (split) torus defined over $E$. Set $G' = Res_{E/F} G$ where $E/F$ is a finite field extension, $T' = Res_{E/F} T$ and $S' \subset T'$ a maximal $F$-split torus. Then $T'$ is the centralizer of $S'$ in $G'$ and a maximal torus of $G'$. Now, what is the relation between the Weyl group $W = N_G(T)/T$ of $(G,T)$ and the relative Weyl group $W' = N_{G'}(S') / T'$ of $(G',S')$ ? Thanks 

Let $G$ be a split reductive group over $\mathbf{Q}_p$ and assume $G$ has connected center. Let $T$ be a maximal split subtorus of $G$ and $R$ be the roots of $(G,T)$. Let $\chi : T(\mathbf{Q}_p) \to \mathbf{Z}_p^\times$ be a continuous character and assume $\chi \circ \alpha^\vee \neq 1$ for all $\alpha \in R$. Question: Do we have $w(\chi)=\chi$ if and only if $w=1$ ? This is true for $\mathrm{GL}_n$ or $\mathrm{GSp}_{2n}$ and also for unramified characters, but is it in general ? Remark: If the center of $G$ is not connected there are counterexamples, e.g. $G=\mathrm{SL}_2$ and $\chi : \mathrm{diag}(x,x^{-1}) \mapsto (-1)^{\mathrm{ord}_p(x)}$. (Edit) Remark: If the center of $G$ is connected and $\alpha \in R$, then $\chi \circ \alpha^\vee \neq 1 \Leftrightarrow s_\alpha(\chi) \neq \chi$. Edit / Answer: The connectedness of the center is not a sufficient condition. There is a counterexample with $G_2$ : the longest element of its Weyl group $w_0$ acts on $T(\mathbf{Q}_p)$ by $w_0(t)=t^{-1}$ and one can construct a character $\chi$ such that $\chi \circ \alpha^\vee \neq 1$ for all $\alpha \in R$ and $w_0(\chi)=\chi$ as follow. Assume $p \neq 2$ so that $\mathbf{Q}_p^\times \cong \mathbf{Z} \times \left( \mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z} \right)^\times \times \mathbf{Z}_p$ and let $\chi_1 : \mathbf{Q}_p^\times \twoheadrightarrow \mathbf{Z} \to \{\pm 1\}$ and $\chi_2 : \mathbf{Q}_p^\times \twoheadrightarrow \left( \mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z} \right)^\times \to \{\pm 1\}$, then define $\chi : T(\mathbf{Q}_p) \cong \mathbf{Q}_p^\times \times \mathbf{Q}_p^\times \to \{\pm 1\}$ by $\chi(t_1,t_2)=\chi_1(t_1)\chi_2(t_2)$. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a non archimedean local field $k$. Let $P \subset G$ be a parabolic subgroup with Levi decomposition $P=MN$, $Z_M \subset L$ be the center of $M$ and $S_M \subset Z_M$ be the maximal split torus. It is commonly used that there exist element $s \in S_M(k)$ whose action by conjugation on $N(k)$ is strictly contracting, meaning that for any compact open subgroup $N_0 \subset N(k)$, the intersection $\bigcap_{n \geq 0} s^n N_0 s^{-n}$ is trivial. This is equivalent to $v(\alpha(s))>0$ for all root $\alpha$ appearing in $\rm{Lie}(N)$, $v$ being the valuation on $k$. Unfortunately I could not find a reference for this fact. 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be compact Riemann surfaces that are both hyperbolic (i.e. genus > 1). A classical result of de Franchis implies that the space of non-constant holomorphic maps from $X$ into $Y$ is a finite set. I am investigating the structure of the space of holomorphic mappings from $X$ into $Y^n_\textsf{sym} := Y^n/S_n$ (the $n$-th symmetric product of $Y$). I believe that any holomorphic mapping $f:X \to Y^n_\textsf{sym}$ lifts to a holomorphic mapping $\widetilde{f}:X \to Y^n$ such that $f = \Pi \circ f$ where $\Pi:Y^n \to Y^n_\textsf{sym}$ is the quotient map. Is this assertion true? 

Let $X$ be a (sufficiently nice) topological space and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a group of homeomorphisms of $X$. Assume that $\mathcal{F}$ is also closed under point-wise convergence. I would like to investigate the possibility of defining a metric $d$ on $X$ such that the the isometries of the metric space $(X,d)$ is precisely the set $\mathcal{F}$. Note that I want the topology induced by $d$ to coincide with the original topology on $X$. What are the conditions on $X$ and $\mathcal{F}$ that allow us to construct such a $d$? I am interested in this question from the perspective of hyperbolic geometry. On the unit disk the Poincare metric (up to a constant) is the unique metric that has isometry group the holomorphic automorphisms and conjugates. I want to find a metric on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1\}$ such that the isometries are precisely the holomorphic automorphisms of $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1\}$ and the conjugates of these automorphisms. The Kobayashi pseudodistance on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1\}$ is certainly one distance that satisfies this condition but the fact that $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1\}$ is Kobayashi hyperbolic is a non-trivial fact. I want to see whether it possible show the existence of such a metric by other means. I also want to see how this new metric is related to the Kobayashi distance 

Let $\mathbb{B}^n$ denote the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$. Let $\Gamma$ be a fixed-point free, discrete subgroup of the automorphism group of $\mathbb{B}^n$. Let $M := \mathbb{B}^n / \Gamma$. Then $M$ is a complete Kobayashi hyperbolic manifold. Consequently $M$ is a taut manifold, i.e, every sequence of holomorphic mappings $\{f_n: \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{B}^n\}$ has either a compactly convergent subsequence or a compactly divergent subsequence. I want to know under what conditions on $\Gamma$ I can embed $M$ into another complex manifold $N$ such that every sequence $f_n: \mathbb{D} \to M$ has a subsequence that converges uniformly on compacts to a holomorphic map $f: \mathbb{D} \to \overline{M}$, where I view $M$ as a subset of $N$ and take the closure in $N$. In this situation, we say that $M$ is tautly embedded in $N$. For further details see Abate's book In dimension $1$, it is easy to see that this happens when $M$ is a hyperbolic punctured Riemann surface. In this case $\Gamma$ will be a Fuchsian group of divergence type. The notion of divergence type has been generalized to higher dimension, see section 2 of the paper by Shiga. Is it true that the quotient of the unit ball with a subgroup of the automorphism group of divergence type can be tautly embedded in some complex manifold? 

Theses are simple and natural questions, but I could not find anything about it. If anyone has an answer or a reference this would be very much appreciated. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an abelian category (possibly without enough injective nor projective). (i) Let $A,B \in \mathcal{C}$. When are the $\mathrm{Ext}^n(A,B)$ (defined using Yoneda extensions) sets ? (ii) Let $A \in \mathcal{C}$ and suppose that $\mathrm{Ext}^n(A,B)$ is a set for all $B \in \mathcal{C}$. Is $\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet(A,-)$ a $\delta$-functor ? If yes is it universal ? (iii) Same as (ii) in the special case where $\mathcal{C}$ has enough projective. PS : I edited a bit the question in view of Fernando Muro's comments. 

Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small category and $\mathrm{Cat}$ be the 2-category of small categories. Let $F,G : \mathcal{C} \to \mathrm{Cat}$ be two functors and $\theta : F \to G$ be a natural transformation such that for any object $X$ of $\mathcal{C}$, the functor $\theta_X : F(X) \to G(X)$ is an equivalence of categories (in other words, there exists a functor $\eta_X : G(X) \to F(X)$ and isomorphisms of functors $\eta_X \theta_X \cong 1_{F(X)}$ and $\theta_X \eta_X \cong 1_{G(X)}$). Then, is $\theta$ an equivalence of natural transformations? In other words, is there a natural transformation $\eta : G \to F$ and isomorphisms of natural transformations $\eta \theta \cong 1_F$ and $\theta \eta \cong 1_G$? 

Let $G$ be a reductive group over a $p$-adic field $k$, $S \subset G$ a maximal $k$-split torus, $\Phi(G,S)$ the relative root system and $\Delta$ a basis of $\Phi$. There is a group homomorphism : $$S(k) \to \mathbb{Z}^{\Delta}, s \mapsto (\mathrm{ord_p} \alpha(s))_{\alpha \in \Delta}$$ with finite cokernel and kernel equal to $S_0 (Z(k) \cap S(k))$ where $S_0 \subset S(k)$ is the maximal compact subgroup and $Z$ the center of $G$. This is used in many papers (e.g. Tit's "Reductive groups over local fields") but I could not find a reference for the proof. 

Let $F^\bullet : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ be a cohomological delta-functor which vanishes in degree strictly greater than $d$. Thus, $F^{d-\bullet}$ is a homological delta-functor. Now assume that $F^n$ is effaceable (by injectives) for all $n \geq 1$, so that $F^\bullet$ is a universal delta-functor. Then what can be said about $F^{d-\bullet}$ ? Is it coeffaceable (even if $\mathcal{A}$ does not necessarily have enough projectives) ? Is it universal ? 

My question concerns the cohomology of a compact $p$-adic Lie group $G$ (wich is pro-$p$). Let $M$ be a finite dimensional $\mathbb{Q}_p$-vector space with continuous linear $G$-action. Lazard showed that, under certain hypothesis, the continuous cohomology of $G$ in $M$ is isomorphic to (a sub-module of) the cohomology of its Lie algebra in $M$. My question is now : what if $M$ has coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_p$ ? Is there a way to compute the continuous cohomology of $G$ in $M$ using its Lie algebra ? Thanks in advance.
