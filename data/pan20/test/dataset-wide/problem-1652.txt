The average global land temperature has indeed been relatively stable for the last 10 years or so, but I cannot explain how the journalist claims this to be true for the period 1997 to 2003/2004. Perhaps if you play enough with the smoothing algorithm and the confidence intervals, you might be able to get similar results. The numbers from the Hadley Centre are relatively consistent with other regularly published data sets, e.g. the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis from NASA. 

Razie's right. Let's talk about vitamins/minerals and other nutritional/dietary supplements separately. (Nutritional = dietary, which is used in the sense of what we eat, not used in the sense of weight-loss "dieting" - although weight loss supplements also fit in this category). Many vitamins and minerals are absolutely essential parts of our diet - they play roles such as co-enzymes for many physiological functions, including the immune system. Vitamins are things like A/C/D/B vitamins; Minerals are things like Iron or Calcium. With a very well-balanced diet, we can get everything we need through our food - but most people in this country don't. Some foods (like cereals and rice) are "fortified" or "enriched" to be sure people are getting closer to 100% of the most essential ones because people often aren't (especially kids who are in a critical growing stage). If you want to be certain, you can track your vitamin intake using a nutrition calculator that includes vitamins/minerals. Eating a wide diversity of colors of vegetables and fruits is one way to help get more of the vitamin/mineral spectrum. For most people who don't carefully balance their diet, taking a regular multivitamin is a very common and appropriate way to cover the bases of what's necessary. Also: 

The answer to the question in the title is no. The article is not completely nonsense, but probably a very creative interpretation of the data the journalist is trying to analyze. All data sets from the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre (which the Daily Mail article refers to) are available here. The data set with deviations in the global average land temperature sets 0 to the average temperate in the years 1961 through 1990. The smoothed average deviations for the years after 1990 are as follows (source): 

Summary: We can't say all are good or all are bad. It's a case-by-case basis. That's why it's such a controversial topic. Many times doctors can't even agree on what works. We have to read, talk to doctors / experts, and ultimately decide how safe to play it. 

then they can make any supplement they want out of it - without even a burden of proof that their dosing quantity or combination with other chemicals is safe. Then, if a company wants to sell a new ingredient in a supplement, all they have to do is send the FDA 

The calculation you're linking to assumes 20,000 hours of work during residency. According to Wikipedia's section on residency in the United States, the residency usually lasts for one year (state dependent) and the number of working hours is limited to 80 per week. That makes a maximum of 4,160 hours, which is not even close to the number used in the claim. 

What you see in the video is the АЛСН (автоматическая локомотивная сигнализация непрерывного действия) signal, a system for automatic train control used in the ex-Soviet states. Due to the low signalling speed, you can even read the signal from the pulsating bulb, which is here "code Z" (three long pulses separated by short breaks) basically telling a train on the track that the next signal will be green. Drawing any current from the rails (as done in the video) is very likely to disturb the reception of the signal in nearby trains. A lack of signal on the rails is interpreted by the running stock as if the next signal is "red" and would force nearby trains to stop. 

But not all vitamins/minearls are safe for all people; if you have certain medical conditions, there are vitamins you should avoid. Also, certain vitamins are toxic if you take too much. But there are also certain conditions where you need to take extra of certain vitamins. That's why it's important to ask a doctor what's right for you. "Nutritional supplements" is a very broad category of everything except food and pharmaceutical drugs. It includes vitamins/minerals, but also include a wide variety of things. It includes herbal preparations like Echinacea or St. Johns Wort (which btw is really essentially an antidepressant medication, complete with drug-interactions and side effects), to things that claim to build muscle, to things that claim to make you smarter, to the random new weird supplements with magical weight loss claims (like you see advertised on website banners everywhere, "1 weird thing I did to lose 1528735 pounds" or whatever). People often take these in hopes that it will help some aspect of their health - and some do help. Some are good. But others don't do much at all. - and worst, some do bad things. This is where we need to pause and talk about safety, because there are vast inconsistencies between supplements in terms of safety, efficacy, and truthfulness of claims. There is something essential that we all need to be aware of: Vitamin and nutritional supplements in the USA are not monitored nor investigated by the FDA, so there is no governmental monitoring of their content, quality, nor accuracy of claims of what they do. This does not mean that all are worthless or unsafe. It means we have to be careful consumers of supplements. At the bottom, I have links to look at interactions with other medications, as well as a couple notes on how to spot a good one. From [$URL$ 

Yes, they are. The Indian Licence Agreement for Provision of Cellular Mobile Telephone Service states in section 42.1: 

First of all, Google can find quite a lot of background on the dispute between Steve Lipsky and Range Resources Corp. This article is a summary of the situation, where Range Resources Corp. has been drilling for gas close to Lipsky's estate, after which Lipsky is blaming the company for ruining a well, from which he used to get his fresh water supply. It is perhaps also worth to note that Lipsky has been convicted for being 'part of a "conspiracy to defame" the company because he'd circulated a video "calculated to alarm the public into believing the water was burning."'. Assuming that the verdict was correct, Lipsky has previously distributed videos with fraudulent claims about the water from his well burning. The news article I linked to, mentions methane contamination as the reason for the burning water, which is consistent with the fact that Range has been drilling for natural gas nearby. Methane is indeed a highly inflammable gas (mixed with air, the methane content must exceed appr 5% for the mix to be inflammable) and it seriously contributes to the greenhouse effect, but except for that, it is pretty harmless with no known toxic effects (material data safety sheet). There are even relatively high levels of methane in the humane digestion tract. According to this study, the average flatus (fart) has a methane content of about 7%. Now, methane is barely soluble in water, according to Wikipedia, only 22.7mg/l. If you look closely at the video from 0:20 to 0:30, there is also no obvious proof that the water is actually burning. To me, it looks as if a gas escaping the water pipe is burning at the opening. If the water had actually been burning, why wouldn't the water jet burn further away from the pipe opening as well? So to answer your questions: Is it safe to drink water, which can be set on fire? In this case, there is no sign that the water is actually burning. If whatever burns at the pipe opening is methane gas, it is in no way harmful to drink water having been in contact with methane gas or with small amounts of methane disolved. Is it for ordinary home purposes safe to use water, which can be set on fire? Still doubting that the water is actually burning, what may be a problem is that methane is released in closed rooms through a water pipe network. Even here, small levels are uncritical, but depending on how fast methane is released and how fast the air in the room is replaced, there may of course be a risk, that explosive levels of methane are reached. 

Trustworthy websites that the medical profession uses: Medscape, Medline Plus (NIH), UpToDate, [epocrates] (an app, not free)10, NetWellness.org, mayoclinic.org, and other medical university-based health websites. There are also commercial websites and shows like WebMD, Dr. Oz, The Doctors... those are commercial companies/websites/shows that get revenue from ads and from talking about "cutting-edge" topics. I myself am skeptical about what I hear from them and read up about it myself on more scholarly or peer-reviewed websites. 

For example, I take a Centrum daily multivitamin on recommendation from an M.D./PharmD because "Centrum has been on the market for so long that if there were a safety concern, it is statistically likely that it would have surfaced years ago already." I also take Calcium/VitD from another famous, older company. GNC is a company that's been around a long time, so I would trust a standard multivitamin. But I'm skeptical of some of their things because they put their brand-name on products that make some pretty extreme claims, as well as a lot of brand-new products, which brings me to the next point: 

In the following analysis of the actual divorce rates, the respondents are divided into three groups: A: the woman does most of the work B: the work is equally shared C: the man does most of the work The divorce rates for these groups are found in table 9.2 (page 207). Group A: 3.1%, group B: 4.6%, group C: 5.4%. The numbers were then corrected for several factors, which have known impact on the breakup risk: 

If we follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definition of chronic fatigue syndrom, a CFS diagnosis requires the following (among other) criterion to be fulfilled:
