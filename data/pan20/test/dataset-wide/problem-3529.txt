I can only speak from experience as someone else that usually works out a few hours before going to sleep. I often have the same problem, particularly after cardio due to the elevated heartrate, but sometimes after weightlifting too. The best thing you can do for yourself is to establish a night-routine that will help relax your body between a workout and sleep. Personally, I just read for an hour before I go to bed (preferably fiction, not a technical book). This should bring down all of your vitals and allow you to fall asleep more easily. A cup of decaf tea/coffee also helps. Try to avoid carbs right before bed if you have a post-workout snack/meal. I fall asleep easier if I just eat something with protein like nuts or edamame. Your muscles will likely be tense after a workout, which can also prevent sleep. To help this, I'd recommend self-massage, otherwise known as myofascial release. This works EXTREMELY well for me, and it's quite relaxing (a bit painful). Your gym likely has some of these foam rollers in stock. If not, you can purchase one cheap on Amazon. 

To help put it in perspective: Your average 8oz cup of tea contains 26mg of caffeine; about the same as a 12oz can of soda, which contains 29mg of caffeine. 3 sugar cubes is about 7g of sugar (27 cals), while a can of soda has about 33g of sugar (138 cals). So, 5 cups of tea with 3 cubes of sugar each would be about the equivalent of a single can of soda's worth of sugar and 5 cans of sodas' worth of caffeine. It's generally recommended that you eat no more than 25g of added-sugar per day (or 5% of your daily caloric intake, whichever comes first), but it's best to limit it as much as possible. High blood sugar will cause insulin spikes which can cause your body to store extra fat and prevent muscle gain. The best time to consume sugar is after a workout, since it helps restore glycogen levels. It also helps optimize the absorption of creatine if you take supplements. A single cup of tea with 2-3 sugar cubes after a workout should be relatively harmless and may even help your recovery, but if you're going to be drinking a lot of tea throughout the day, I would recommend using less sweetener or calorie-free sweeteners such as stevia (i.e., Truvia). On the contrary, if you're trying to lose weight, a cup of tea (preferably green tea with no added sugar) right BEFORE your workout is shown to raise your metabolism and aide in fat-burn. 

Drinking less water is not an option because of the intense sweating when hiking for 9 hours or so under the hot sun. An obvious choice was to replace water with sports drink like Gatorade. Firstly, I don't like sports drink. Secondly, I want to know what is the exact thing my body lost with excessive sweating and needed to be put back into my body. I am not a chemist/biologist, but from what I read, the term electrolyte is loosely used to refer to a group of minerals. Sodium, potassium, calcium and more. 

When I have this weird back pain, it is like a fatigue muscle is in need of some deep relaxation. There is something I can do to relief this pain, most of them requires me to sit down, however if it is severe my back will feel very very stiff, I will only be able to sit at a very up-right position. There are a few things that I can do to relief my back: 

I have read on various places that exercising for a prolonged period of time with excessive water intake can be dangerous. It may lead to water intoxication (hyponatremia). After some searches and a few more articles, it seems that: 

Sites like bodybuilding.com, Men's Fitness, Muscle & Strength, etc. still use terms such as "endomorph, "ectomorph" and "mesomorph". These so-called "somatotypes" were invented by the psychologist (and possible eugenicist) William Herbert Sheldon, Jr. Sheldon tied each of the bodytypes to certain personality traits, and his research has been discredited time and again as racist hogwash. That being said, if so many of these respected fitness websites make reference to the somatotypes, is it because we've since proven there to be some accuracy to the distinct body types without the connection to personality? Or is this just a case of bad science being hard to wash away. 

Carbo loading is generally recommended for endurance events - anything longer than 90 minutes at a moderate pace. In addition, carbo-loading typically has to be done several days in advance. It's possible to glean benefits from carbo-loading the day before, but only if you've been actively maintaining your glycogen stores by replenishing them after excercising. Basically, a 5k run isn't long enough to use up your glycogen stores unless you're really not getting enough carbs in your diet, so the carbo-loading is kind of pointless. It also depends on the type of foods that you're using for your carbohydrates. Grains can negatively impact your performance, especially wheat glutens which create inflammation. The general recommendation for eating before a 5k is simply to eat a good meal 3-4 hours before the event. Something with complex-carbohydrates - e.g. fruit and whole grains - not simple carbs like sugar, as this can spike your insulin levels and make you sluggish. If you wanted to feel what it's like to run out of glycogen during a run, I'd suggest doing a 20k (or half-marathon). Without carbo-loading beforehand, you'll likely deplete your energy stores and enter a state of low blood-sugar (aka "hitting the wall") about 15km or 90 minutes into it. Over time, endurance training increases the amount of glycogen that your body can store, so you can run longer before hitting the wall, as long as your glycogen stores are full. 

Edit: Here is an example of some of the things I came across. It seems that a lot of people say things like "Don't workout longer than an hour." I want to know why, and just blaming it on overtraining is not a sufficient answer. This article says this: 

Wall Sits A good stationary workout (that shouldn't cause any knee pain) would be wall sits. These are definitely not easy and will work quads. 

Casein can help refuel your body when you go for long periods without food (i.e. when you are sleeping). Recommended Supplements - 

Personally, I don't think BCAAs are worth the small, if any, boost in performance. According to examine.com: 

How can I increase bicep width? I am happy with my bicep peak, but I am having trouble increasing the width of my biceps. My arms look rather big from the side but when you look at them head on they are quite narrow/skinny. I have heard that hammer curls improve width, but I haven't seen much of an improvement in the last couple of months. Currently, I work arms once a week (as I do every muscle group) on Tuesdays. My routine usually consists of 3 bicep workouts followed by 3 tricep workouts. I don't have a set routine because I like to switch it up and hit different workouts each week. I will give a sample workout below, again, this is different each week. 

When I cough, I feel a mild pain in my lower back and hip area. (behind my belly button and in my glute) I went to the doctor and he told me I have inflammation in a part of my spinal cord. It is reacting to pressure. Sudden expansion and contraction (like when coughing) will pressure the spinal cord and this will press against the swollen nerves and I will feel pain. The pain is not sharp, it feels more like muscle pain after exertion than being poked by a needle. The doctor gave me some anti-inflammatory pills and he sent me away. I did get better, but it keeps coming back. I found out that certain activities will encourage my back pain to develop. Once developed, it will take many nights worth of high quality sleep to recover. Here are the things that seem to cause back pain, or worsen it: 

I weight 105kg and I am 6'2 (189cm), I drank around 5 litres of water in a 7 to 9 hours day-hike. I had some biscuits and 3 bananas, and 1.2 out of the 5 litres of fluid I had was sports drink. However by the end of the hike I was feeling a slight headache. Was it because I was drinking too much water? I want to find out what the body looses with excessive sweating, and what are the ways to eat/drink accordingly to replenish the lost substances.
