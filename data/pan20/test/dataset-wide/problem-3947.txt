Let $A = k$ (a field) and $B = k\times k$, with $A \to B$ the diagonal morphism. In this case Spec $A$ is a single point, and so there is only stalk to consider. Let $A = k[t]$ (again, $k$ is a field) and $B = k[t,t^{-1}]$, with $A \to B$ being the inclusion. In this case, the map Spec $B \to $ Spec $A$ coicides with the identity at all point of Spec $A$ other than the point $t = 0$, so the interesting case is the stalk of the pushforward at $t = 0$ (this is a case with empty fibre). 

When $p = 2$, the group $G$ is the group of units in the Hurwitz order in the Hamilton quaternions $\mathbb H$ over $\mathbb Q$, i.e. the group $\{\pm 1,\pm i,\pm j,\pm k,(\pm 1 \pm i \pm j\pm k)/2\}$. It is a central extension of $A_4$ by a group of order $2$. The $\ell$-adic cohomology is given by the standard two-dimensional representation of $M_2(\mathbb Q_{\ell}) := \mathbb H \otimes_{\mathbb Q} \mathbb Q_{\ell}$. This is an irrep. of $G$. I can't write down the $p = 3$ case off the top of my head like this, but it will be similar, and the representation on $H^1(\mathbb Q_{\ell})$ should again be irreducible. 

I think this is a special case of the Tietze extension theorem (since any compact Hausdorff space is normal). (Here is one proof.) 

If $X$ is a manifold, and $E$ is a smooth vector bundle over $X$ (e.g. its tangent bundle), then $E$ is again a manifold. Thus working with bundles means that one doesn't have to leave the category of objects (manifolds) under study; one just considers manifold with certain extra structure (the bundle structure). This is a big advantage in the theory; it avoids introducing another class of objects (i.e. sheaves), and allows tools from the theory of manifolds to be applied directly to bundles too. Here is a longer discussion, along somewhat different lines: The historical impetus for using sheaves in algebraic geometry comes from the theory of several complex variables, and in that theory sheaves were introduced, along with cohomological techniques, because many important and non-trivial theorems can be stated as saying that certain sheaves are generated by their global sections, or have vanishing higher cohomology. (I am thinkin of Cartan's Theorem A and B, which have as consequences many earlier theorems in complex analysis.) If you read Zariski's fantastic report on sheaves in algebraic geometry, from the 50s, you will see a discussion by a master geometer of how sheaves, and especially their cohomology, can be used as a tool to express, and generalize, earlier theorems in algebraic geometry. Again, the questions being addressed (e.g. the completeness of the linear systems of hyperplane sections) are about the existence of global sections, and/or vanishing of higher cohomology. (And these two usually go hand in hand; often one establishes existence results about global sections of one sheaf by showing that the higher cohomology of some related sheaf vanishes, and using a long exact cohomology sequence.) These kinds of questions typically don't arise in differential geometry. All the sheaves that might be under consideration (i.e. sheaves of sections of smooth bundles) have global sections in abundance, due to the existence of partions of unity and related constructions. There are difficult existence problems in differential geometry, to be sure: but these are very often problems in ODE or PDE, and cohomological methods are not what is required to solve them (or so it seems, based on current mathematical pratice). One place where a sheaf theoretic perspective can be useful is in the consideration of flat (i.e. curvature zero) Riemannian manifolds; the fact that the horizontal sections of a bundle with flat connection form a local system, which in turn determines the bundle with connection, is a useful one, which is well-expressed in sheaf theoretic language. But there are also plenty of ways to discuss this result without sheaf-theoretic language, and in any case, it is a fairly small part of differential geometry, since typically the curvature of a metric doesn't vanish, so that sheaf-theoretic methods don't seem to have much to say. If you like, sheaf-theoretic methods are potentially useful for dealing with problems, especially linear ones, in which local existence is clear, but the objects are suffiently rigid that there can be global obstructions to patching local solutions. In differential geomtery, it is often the local questions that are hard: they become difficult non-linear PDEs. The difficulties are not of the "patching local solutions" kind. There are difficult global questions too, e.g. the one solved by the Nash embedding theorem, but again, these are typically global problems of a very different type to those that are typically solved by sheaf-theoretic methods. 

I'm surprised, reading the various answers and comments to this question, how much support there is for the idea of reading EGA. It is evidently a mathematical masterpiece of a certain kind, but I would never recommend it to a student to study. In response to a similar question asked on Terry Tao's blog, I posted the following advice: 

Dear Michael, The methods introduced by Wiles, and by Taylor and Wiles, in the two papers that proved FLT, as well as the methods introduced by Ribet in his earlier paper reducing FLT to Shimura--Taniyama, are at the heart of much modern work in algebraic number theory and automorphic forms, such as (in addition to the proofs of Shimura--Taniyama and FLT) the proofs of Serre's conjectures and the Sato--Tate conjecture. Conferences/workshops in these fields typically attract on the order of magnitude of 100 or so particants, which gives you some sense of the number of students/researchers thinking about these questions: its in the tens or hundreds, but probably not in the thousands. Of course, not all these people know all the details, but the people at the top of the field surely do. (Of course, there is a question of what "understand" means exactly. I don't know how many people have both carefully studied all the details of the trace formula arguments that underly Jacquet--Langlands, Langlands--Tunnell, and base-change, and also carefully studied the details of the p-adic Hodge theory and other arithmetic geometry that is used in the arguments. But certainly the top people do understand the significance of these techinques, and are fluent in their use and application, and understand both the overall structure and strategy, as well the technical details, of the proof of FLT itself (and of various more recent related results). Finally, let me note that the best evidence for the final claim of the previous paragraph is that this is currently an extremely vibrant area of research, which has progressed at a rapid clip over the last ten years or so. (The reason for this being that people have not only assimilated the arguments of Wiles/Taylor--Wiles but have improved upon them and pushed them further.) 

Suppose that $X$ is a projective variety, and that $v$ is a discete valuation on $K(X)$ (trivial on $k$) whose corresponding valuation ring we will denote by $R$. The valuative criterion shows that the map Spec $K(X) \rightarrow X$ extends to a map Spec $R \rightarrow X$. If I have the terminology correct, the image of the closed point of Spec $R$ is called the centre of the valuation $v$ on $X$. It has codimension anywhere between $1$ and dim $X$. Note that if $x \in X$ is the centre, then $R$ dominates $\mathcal O\_x$ in $K(X)$ (i.e. we have a local inclusion of local rings $\mathcal O_x \subset R$). Let's suppose for a moment that $X$ is a smooth surface. If the centre $x$ is codimension 1, then both $\mathcal O\_x$ and $R$ are (discrete) valuation rings. Since valuation rings are (characterized by being) maximal for the partial order of dominance, $R$ and $\mathcal O\_x$ coincide, and so the discrete valuation $v$ is just that given by the divisor of which $x$ is the generic point. Suppose instead that $x$ is a closed point. Now we can blow up $x$ in $X$, to get a projective variety $X\_1$, and the centre of $v$ in $X\_1$ will now be contained in the exceptional divisor of $X\_1$ (i.e. the preimage of $x$). If it coincides with the exceptional divisor, then we have found a curve on $X\_1$ giving rise to $v$; otherwise it is a point $x\_1$, which we can blow up again. Either we eventually obtain a divisor on some iterated blow-up of $X$, or we obtain a sequence of points $x \in X, x\_1 \in X\_1, \ldots,$ with each $X\_n$ a blow-up of the previous. In this case one sees that $R = \bigcup \mathcal O\_{x\_n}.$ There are a couple of exercises related to this issue in Hartshorne, namely II.4.5, II.4.12, and V.5.6. If I understand them correctly, any such sequence of $x\_n$ gives a valuation ring $R$ in this way, and $R$ is a discrete valuation ring unless one constructs the sequene $x_n$ in the following manner: choose an irreducible curve $C$ in $X$ and define $x\_n$ to be the intersection of the proper transform of $C$ in $X\_n$ with the exceptional divisor. For a sequence $x_n$ constructed in this latter manner, one obtains not a discrete valuation ring, but rather a rank 2 valuation ring: the valuation is determined by first taking the valuation at the generic point of $C$, and then (for those functions which are defined and non-zero at this generic point) restricting to $C$ and computing the order of zero or pole at $x$. What is the geometric intuition for the discrete valuation rings that correspond to an infinite sequence $x_n$ rather than to some curve on $X$? One can think of them as a transcendental curve on $X$, passing through $x$. Indeed, imagine you had such a curve. Then you could restrict a rational function to it; since it is transcendental, a non-zero rational function would not have a zero or pole along this curve, and so would restrict to give a non-zero meromorphic function on the curve. We could then compute the order of the zero or pole of this meromorphic function at $x$. In other words, because the curve is transcendental, we get a rank one valuation, in contrast to the rank two valuations that arise when we apply this process with an algebraic curve $C$ passing through $x$. I'm not sure about the details of the higher dimensional case. (Among other things, I am worried about the possibility of the center being codim > 1, but singular, which seems like it could complicate the analysis.) Does anyone here know how it goes? 

Dear Clark, This answer is addressed primarily at the final paranthetical comment. There is a "dual" geometric description of $(\mathfrak g, K)$-modules to the Beilinson--Bernstein picture, using orbits of the real group $G(\mathbb R)$ on the flag variety. It is employed by Schmid and Vilonen in many of their papers, and there is an expository article about it by Vilonen in one of the Park City proceedings. In this dual picture, when one takes sections of the sheaves, one really gets $G(\mathbb R)$-representations; I'm not sure off the top of my head which models you get though (the smooth ones or some other ones, or whether you get an option depending on the particular brand of sheaves you use). Regarding your broader question, I've always imagined that one can find a model for a $(\mathfrak g, K)$-module using any brand of regularity you choose (analytic, smooth, distributional, hyperfunctions, and other brands in between, whatever they might be (and perhaps answering that is part of the point of the question!)), and that these will be ordered in the obvious way. But this is certainly not the precise answer you want, and is only a vague intuition. 

As Stankewicz explains, although elliptic curves appear in two guises in the modular parameterization $X_0(N) \to E,$ first because $E$ is an elliptic curve, and secondly because $X_0(N)$ parameterizes elliptic curves, it is something of a red herring to think of these two appearances of elliptic curves as having anything to do with one another. The reason that $X_0(N)$ appears in the problem of describing elliptic curves is because elliptic curves have two dimensional $H^1$, and $X_0(N)$ is the Shimura variety over $\mathbb Q$ associated to the group $GL_2$. Thus, as Stankewicz notes, Shimura curves (which are the Shimura varieties attached to twisted forms of $GL_2$) can equally well give parameterizations of elliptic curves. Now the way we prove things about $X_0(N)$ (e.g. properties of its Heegner points, as in Pete Clark's answer) is using its moduli interpretation. But there are two things to bear in mind: First, most (maybe all?) properties of the special points on $X_0(N)$, such as the Heegner points, are special cases of general aspects of the theory of Shimura varieties (so although the proofs use the moduli interpretation, the statements can be formulated in a way that doesn't refer to the moduli-theoretic interpretation, but instead refers to the interpretation of $X_0(N)$ as a Shimura variety). Second, the transfer of information is always from $X_0(N)$ to $E$. So while Heegner points give certain interesting points on $X_0(N)$ defined over class fields of quadratic imaginary fields, which can be mapped down to $E$ to give interesting points on $E$ defined over such fields, if one takes a random point on $E$ defined over a class field of an imaginary quadratic field and pulls it back to $X_0(N)$, it is not so easy to say what is going on with the preimages in general. Finally, I think remark (3) in Pete Clark's answer is an interesting one. In the Mazur and Swinnerton-Dyer paper that David Hansen refer's to in his first comment, if I am remembering correctly, they also suggest that the images in $E$ of the critical points of the map from $X_0(N)$ to $E$ that lie on the geodesic arc joining $0$ to $\infty$ in the upper half-plane may be worth studying. As with Birch's suggestion of Weierstrass points, I'm not sure how much has been done on this.
