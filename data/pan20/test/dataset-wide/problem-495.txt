The short version: the bike was fine (maybe low on tire pressure) but you were not, provided you didn't have something like a brake dragging (which you would have noticed). I doubt a bike would have retained air in its tires for a few months, so you should have pumped them up [this may have added some rolling resistance, but it shouldn't have killed you on its own]. Winter biking is more difficult than Spring biking (and I'd argue summer biking). The colder air makes it harder to breathe (and thus carrying loads is harder). Your brain also hinders you a bit for the risk of ice/snow (though you said there wasn't any). Your face feels cold, your hands feel cold, so on so forth. Depending on how you're dressed up, your clothes may be doing additional air restrictions. Also, a lot of people are prone to over-bundling up -- your body will come to temperature in a short length of riding, so don't wear too much. That being said, at 10 F, the bike itself is fine -- it is just like it was in the summer (*) [the oil is too]. Its you who isn't. But what you experience is normal, and as a person who does winter commuting, the best way to get over it is mostly to just keep riding (start without the trailer [the 70 pounds is harder for you as the engine, since you're weaker, not the bike itself] and go for some rides, and build it up -- I regularly bike during winters, but the first 2 weeks I find a lot less breath on hand [and I ride pretty much every day]). Your stamina should come up (albeit not to summer levels). Compound it with suddenly doing a 6 mile trip, and its even worse. (*) When it gets below freezing, you can get things like water going into your brake/shift lines, etc. which can make the bike not fine. (**) When the snow and ice come, its not just the increased difficulty of breathing and the cold that get you, but you have to start in higher gears to move. And the resistance goes up dramatically, so your effort also goes up. 

The answer is not really. Chains are dirty and they get you dirty. Dry lubes tend to be better than wet lubes in this regard, but they'll both quickly get your legs dirty. But dry lubes are normally not considered to be good for wet riding. You can clean your chain periodically (e.g. Park Tool CM-5.2 Cyclone (TM) Chain Scrubber, which clamps onto the low tension part of the chain, runs the chain through a pool of cleaner with some foam and bristles to scrub it as you back pedal), and relube it, but the crud from road and stuff will make any lube dirty quite quickly. Some more elaborate and thorough ways of cleaning a chain (with considerably more work) are outlined here. The other options are chain guards or full chain cases (possible with an IGH if you need gears) or belt drive. And tying your pant legs helps a good amount too. Edit: I've added some notes on chain cleaners from some chain manufacturers (Shimano, KMC, SRAM). Follow at your own desire. Many people use chain cleaning machines like the Park Tool CM-5.2 or remove their chains and soak them in a solvent for a bit, but manufacturers are generally against this. YMMV. FWIW, I own a CM-5.2, but I don't use it very often. KMC does not recommend the use of a chain cleaner like the Park Tool CM-5.2 (in the CG-2.2 kit): 

It looks like its a steel (CrMo) frame (see if it says this on it somewhere). This is a good resource for repainting the bike. If you don't sand and rough up the old surface, the paint will likely not stick (a primer helps the paint stick as well). Spraying the crankset is a bad idea - you may get paint in the bottom bracket, or on the chainrings. If you want to spray the arms or something, take it apart and then spray parts that don't touch the drivetrain on their own (in fact, you'll need to strip the bike to spraypaint it properly, or at least guard out the entire drivetrain). That being said, its not that bad of a color, and as a student, a roughed up bike is less of a target. If you're not going to spend money or the effort to strip it down, I'd say roughing up the surface with a bit of sand paper and brushing on some paint (probably 2 euros more on the whole) would be a better option), but in any case, the bike will look uglier than it does now! 

Unfortunately, people are different in their behavior to bicycles and you need to be vigilant. Following the law by yielding to people who have already arrived generally works well (even if you have to wave them to go yourself even if they have the right). If they're waving, check and proceed with caution -- there are a decent number of people who will also try to gun it with a cyclist, and there may be both types to yield and gun at the same intersection. 

The first thing to check is that your rear wheel can take a 10 speed cassette. If this is the case, then you can move to step two, which is picking compatible rear derailleurs and shifters. A 10 speed Shimano road shifter needs a 7-9 speed mountain/road rear derailleur or a 10 speed road derailleur. A 10 speed Shimano mountain shifter needs a 10 speed mountain shifter. You're proposing a road shifter with a mountain derailleur (both 10 speed) which won't work. Once you know the cassette size you want to deal with, you can choose the appropriate model of rear derailleur (long cage, medium cage, short cage, for example) by looking at the required capacity. 

(a) Friction is gone on the right on 10/11 sp dura ace (they apparently save a spring while doing this, which probably simplifies things a little bit aside from interest in this). Microshift BS-T10 bar ends are 10 speed, front friction with rear switchable, and you can probably mount them on the downtube with a bit of work. (b) Other friction shifters should be fine. (c) SRAM among others do. I'd think going with a 9 speed system may be easier (you can find Dura Ace SL-7700 shifters with index+friction for cheap). 

Since we live in the advent of the smartphone, you can likely look at the brand and model of a bike and quickly google it. Two sites to look at are Bicycle Blue Book and Bikepedia. This probably helps you avoid having to look at the individual component specs since most of the time if a part is replaced, it is replaced with something at least as good as the original equipment (you may not be able to see what components are on the bike to begin with). In general its a pretty hard problem (which you really need experience), and in an auction situation, the best thing to do would be to bring along a friend who knows a lot about bikes to tell you what to bid, and then buy them a beer afterwards. 

Generally, with a 36T, you want a long cage (Shimano SGS), such as a Deore rear derailleur. While the capacity calculation you've done says OK, the max sprocket for a short cage road will be in the 20's or low 30's (in this case, its listed as 32t). Thus, I'd buy a long cage RD (or at least medium cage).
