The basic heuristic behind the scenes in all of these conjectures is that there is optimal "square-root" cancellation in the various error terms. The estimate (2) is surely not true; the explicit formula links this to a sum over zeros of the related Dirichlet L-function, and it has zeros on the half-line. Instead, one may hope that $$\psi(\chi, x) = \sum_{n < x} \chi(n) \Lambda(n) = O(x^{1/2 + \varepsilon}).$$ This is square-root in the number of terms, with an extra $x^{\varepsilon}$ thrown in for safety. It's much more subtle to figure out powers of logs. To get to Montgomery's conjecture, you use the formula $$\psi(q,a,x) = \frac{1}{\phi(q)} \sum_{\chi} \overline{\chi}(a) \psi(\chi, x),$$ and imagine that there is square-root cancellation in the sum over $\chi$. You have roughly $q$ terms, are dividing by roughly $q$, and so in all this amounts to having an error of size $x^{1/2+\varepsilon} q^{-1/2 + \varepsilon}$. 

There is a "quick and dirty" way to find the inner product of two cusp forms that are not necessarily Hecke eigenforms. I learned this from Akshay Venkatesh. The formula is that \begin{equation*}\langle f, g \rangle = \lim_{y \rightarrow 0^+} y^k \int_0^{1} f(x+iy) \overline{g(x+iy)} dx, \end{equation*} where $f$ and $g$ are weight $k$ and the inner product is normalized via \begin{equation*} \langle f, g \rangle = \int_{\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}} y^k f(z) \overline{g(z) }\frac{1}{V} \frac{dx dy}{ y^2}, \end{equation*} where $V$ is the volume of $\Gamma \backslash \mathbb{H}$. The philosophy behind the proof is that the horocycle $x+iy: 0 \leq x \leq 1$ equidistributes in the fundamental domain as $y \rightarrow 0$. You can prove the formula by spectrally decomposition $f \overline{g}$. The projection onto the constant eigenfunction gives $\langle f, g\rangle$. The projections onto the cusp forms integrate out to zero. The projection onto the Eisenstein series leaves the constant terms which are bounded by $\sqrt{y}$, and hence have limit zero as $y$ tends to $0$. If $f(z) =\sum_n a(n) e(nz)$ and $g(z) = \sum_n b(n) e(nz)$, then of course \begin{equation*} \int_0^{1} f(x+iy) \overline{g(x+iy)} dx = \sum_{n \geq 1} a(n) \overline{b(n)} \exp(-4 \pi n y). \end{equation*} 

This is actually something in a paper but the author claimed it without proof. Let x be a positive elment of norm 1 in a $C^*-$algebra A, and Her(x) is the hereditary subalegbra generated by x. Given $\epsilon>0$,let $f_\epsilon$ be thecontinuous function on R defined as follow: $f_\epsilon \equiv 0 \quad on \quad [-\infty,\epsilon/2]$ $f_\epsilon \quad is \quad linear \quad on\quad [\epsilon/2,\epsilon]$ $f_\epsilon \equiv 1 \quad on\quad [\epsilon, +\infty]$ So $f_\epsilon$ increase to the identiy function on [0,1] when $\epsilon$ decrease to 0, and $Her(x)=\overline{\cup_{\epsilon>0} f_\epsilon(x)Af_\epsilon(x)}$. Let p be a projection in Her(x). then how do we know that there must exist a $\epsilon$ such that $p\in \overline{f_\epsilon(x)Af_\epsilon(x)}$? Or more generally, Let A be the inductive limit of {$A_n$}, and p is a projection in A,does it follow that p is actually in some $A_n$? 

Let G be a finite subgroup of U(n), the unitary group acts on $\mathbb{C}^n$. If there is a unit vector $x$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ such that g(x) is almost orthogonal to x, for all $g\in G$ except the identity, can we perturb x so that g(x) is exactly orthogonal to x, for all $g\in G$ except the identity? More precisely, can we find a very small number $\epsilon>0$, so that if there exist a unit vector $x$ and the inner product $|(g(x),x))|<\epsilon$ for all $g\in G$ \ {1}, then we can find another unit vector $y$, such that $(g(y),y)=0$ for all $g\in G$ \ {1}? Is it possible to further require that $||x-y||$ be small too? 

From the standard zero-counting formula $N(T) = \frac{T}{2\pi} \log(\frac{T}{2 \pi e}) + O(\log{T})$, this shows $N(T + h) - N(T) = \frac{h}{2 \pi} \log(\frac{T}{2 \pi}) + O(\log{T})$, and hence $N(T+h) - N(T) \geq 1$ provided $h$ is large enough compared to the implied constants. This shows what you ask for with an unspecified $\varepsilon$. 

The problem with using Euler-Maclaurin is that $e^{2\pi i \tau x}$ is oscillatory. The remainder term in the Euler-Maclaurin formula will involve the integral of the absolute value of the derivative of the summand. The oscillation of $e^{2 \pi i \tau x}$ means that this derivative will be roughly the same size as the summand itself so the remainder term is not helpful (unless $x$ is going to zero in some sense). This is in contrast to the case with $x=0$ where each differentiation gives an extra saving factor of $(\tau +a)^{-1}$. 

Here's a variation on the arguments using the explicit formula. If there were no zeros in the critical strip then the explicit formula would say $$\psi_0(x) = x - \frac{\zeta'(0)}{\zeta(0)} - \frac12 \log(1-x^{-2}),$$ where $\psi_0(x)$ is the same as the usual $\psi(x)$ except when $x$ takes integer values $\psi_0(x)$ is the average of the left and right limits of $\psi(x)$. The right hand side is continuous for $x >0$ while the left hand side is not. The argument generalizes to show that there cannot be finitely many zeros in the critical strip, or even an infinitude that do not grow "too quickly." Precisely, if $$\sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho}$$ converged fast enough to form a continuous function of $x$ then the same argument would carry over. 

Let $s_{N}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_{i}$ a partial sum of real numbers. Let $L=\lim_{i\to +\infty}|a_{i+1}/a_{i}|$. Suppose $L$ finite and nonzero. The well known ratio criterion describes the convergence of the sequence $\{s_{N}\}$. Is there any way to approximate $s_{N}$ as a function of $L$ and $a_{N}$ for $N>>0$? Something like $s_{N}\thicksim f(L,a_{N})$ with some fixed function $f$? In case yes, are there also explicit behaviours of $s_{N}$ in terms of the root $\lim_{N\to +\infty}|a_{N}|^{1/N}$? 

Let $A$ be a Dedekind domain, $I$ be an ideal in $A$ and let $I^{-1}$ be the inverse of $I$ as a fractional ideal in $K$, where $K$ is the quotient field of $A$. It seems quite natural to have a $A-$module isomorphism between $I^{-1}/A$ and $A/I$ if $I$ is principal, but to construct this isomorphism in general appears to be hard and probably impossible. I was wondering if explicit contrexamples are available in literature? I have not found any of them so far. 

Let $L/K/F$ be a tower of separable finite field extensions and let $x\in L$ such that $L=K(x)$. Under which conditions is it possible to choose $x$ such that $N_{L/K}(x)$ is again a primitive generator of $K/F$? In other words, when is it possible to choose $x$ in general such that $L=K(x)$ and $K=F(N_{L/K}(x))$? Are there different conditions in case one takes the trace instead of the norm? 

Let $E:y^2=x(x-1)(x-\lambda)$ be the Legendre form of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb{C}$. The ramified covering $E\to \mathbb{P}_{1}$ defined so that $(x,y)\mapsto x$ has two branches and ramification points $0,1,\lambda,\infty$. The two branches $y=\pm \sqrt{x(x-1)(x-\lambda)}$ are therefore glued at the ramification points. $E$ would turn out to be hence the glueing of two spheres $\mathbb{P}_{1}$ at the 4 distinct points $0,1,\lambda,\infty$. Such an object has not genus 1, therefore there has to be a mistake. In J. Silverman's AEC at the very beginning of chapter 6 it is explained that what one does is actually to glue the spheres along the two segments $\overline{\infty 0}$ and $\overline{1\lambda}$. This gives a torus, but still I don't understand why all the points of the segments has to be removed by the two branches? And why not to choose another couple of disjoint segments like $\overline{01}$ and $\overline{\infty\lambda}$? All integrals of $dx/y$ over paths in the complement of the ramification points are perfectly defined in the same branch once the sign of the square root is chosen, see for example figure 6.5 at page 159, where a closed path $\alpha$ is taken across both segments. So my question is: why do we remove the entire segments if the junction points of the two branches are only 4?
