The reply to "How is the English noun 'system' a 'base'?" is that it isn't a base. The noun "system" is derived from the base "system-" by adding a zero suffix for the nominative singular: 

Many people seem to be under the impression that context free phrase structure grammar (cfpsg) cannot describe discontinuous constituents. It can, and these are good examples to show that. Suppose that we can derive a new phrase structure rule (psr) by composing two psrs, according to the scheme [A -> x B y](B -> z) = A -> xzy, where A, B are non-terminal symbols and x, y, z are strings of non-terminal and terminal symbols. The notation [rule i](rule j) = rule k means that rule i applies to rule j to derive rule k. Then, for your examples, we have: 

There has been a conflict among linguists since, well, forever, about whether phonemes are analytic devices created by linguists, or whether phonemes actually exist, in some sense, and are discovered by linguists. Whichever side you choose, you'll be in good company. Personally, I take the realistic side, which I take it is the side argued by Edward Sapir in The Psychological Reality of Phonemes. A version of that view is that of David Stampe, in various publications, and in the unpublished paper "Yes, Virginia ..." (... there is a phoneme). Your idea about it appears to be a version of the analytic view, similar to that of Daniel Jones'. And if you take the opposing psychological view, it is indeed an error. But some would agree with you. The division of opinion in linguistics is reminiscent of the controversy in mathematics on whether mathematical objects are created by mathematicians or discovered by them. The latter position is called Platonism. 

Benjamin Lee Whorf proposed a description of the possible English monosyllables in 1940 -- the paper is in Language, Thought, and Reality. Morris Halle gave an elegant (though probably wrong) theory based on his "simplicity metric". That was in his paper "Phonology in Generative Grammar". In order to economize on the feature specifications in the lexicon, we formulate Morpheme Structure Rules (MSRs) that let us abbreviate lexical entries by filling in omitted specifications. We must stop writing new MSRs when the feature specs in all the MSRs come to equal the saved features in lexical entries; that is the point of diminishing returns. Then the admissible morphemes are those morphemes which would not be altered by the application of any MSR. David Stampe's Natural Phonology makes the admissible words those which would not be changed by any of the universal processes that remain unsuppressed in adult speech. (Processes are suppressed during the course of language acquisition when their application would prevent children from pronouncing adult forms accurately.) My idea about admissibility is that it cannot be connected directly with the words actually in the lexicon of a language, because it is perfectly normal for those to include many recently borrowed words which do not fit the phonemic pattern of the language at all. 

Given your background, I'd suggest starting with the Chomsky hierarchy, keeping in mind the Peters-Richie result. Also relevant is the demonstration that the classical transformational grammar of English can be reconstructed within context free phrase structure grammar -- see GPSG. 

On the theory that speakers ordinarily hear and aim to pronounce phonemes, if they can interpret the [x] as a /k/ phoneme of English which has been lenited to [x], then they will say /k/. Using @user6726's example of English "baker", where some of us customarily lenite a /k/ to [x], then an English speaker will aim to pronounce /bejkr/, and if he lenites the /k/ to [x], this will be phonetically [bejxr]. This gets it more or less right by accident. So it's possible for a foreign word with /x/ to be misheard as English /k/ and pronounced by a naive English speaker as the allophone [x] (at least sometimes). Whether this path of borrowing is followed depends on some more or less obvious circumstances, including whether the foreign /x/ is in a position where it could be lenited in English (not at the beginning of a word or syllable). 

Consider the difference in tongue position between the /æ/ of "cat" and the following /t/. The /t/ phoneme of English has neutral vowel color -- it's not palatalized, velarized, or rounded. In pronunciation, how do you get from the palatal vowel /æ/ to the neutral /t/, at the end of very same syllable? You have to (1) neutralize the /æ/ to a nonpalatal vowel, (2) palatalize the /t/, or (3) insert a glide reflecting the change in tongue position going from palatal to nonpalatal position. It's just mechanical. Various languages or dialects of English make different choices among (1)-(3). You're hearing (3). I think other English dialects choose (2). 

You will notice that many, many of these additional predicted sentences are actually not acceptable. So, by this test, your tree is incorrect. 

It is a popular idea in linguistics that organization in terms of new information and old information is important in language structure. Here is an especially interesting working out of that idea. 

Sometimes people do acoustic studies of instruments' resonances, but it doesn't seem to have much to do with how performers think and talk about their playing. While learning flute recently, I became interested in pursuing the relation between vowel perception and flute tone using the notion of tone color. Tone color is something flutists do talk about. Here is a reference to a post of mine in a forum frequented by flutists: SaxOnTheWeb post. But apparently none of the flutists there could make any sense of it. From my casual reading about flutes, it's not even clear to me that flute tone perception has the two dimensions that would justify the analogy to vowel quality. 

Yes, I think you are correct. American English l in the onset of a syllable is velar, typically, while in the offset of a syllable it is uvular. The SPE feature system gives a good foundation for describing this with its three binary tongue body features high, back, and low, which apply to primary articulations or secondary articulations, and as well to vowels and consonants. In the SPE system, velars and velarized sounds are [+high,+back] and uvulars and uvularized sounds are [-high,+back]. It is not clear to me about how [+/- low] fits into this scheme, so far as secondary consonant articulation is concerned. The textbook consensus that syllable offset l in American English is velarized rather than uvularized has puzzled me, since it seems so obviously wrong. Maybe this is due to the influence of Peter Ladefoged, who, of course, did not speak American English. 

I recommend The Syntactic Phenomena of English by James McCawley. It's the best book on syntax I've ever read, and I used it at least twice for intermediate level courses on syntax. It's a book for grown-ups, and it's about doing syntax, not about methodology or syntactic theory. (There is theory there, which I don't much agree with, personally, but it doesn't matter.) You're certainly right to question whether there is syntactic movement. I don't think there is (despite my above recommendation). You might want to look at Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, which reconstructs the main parts of the transformational analysis of English without appeal to syntactic movement. That is also a book for grown-ups. 

If you don't count underline as a character, sure. Though it's old fashioned. To give the impression that a story was redacted from a police report, but with the name of a principle character concealed, you see things like "After recovering from these violent events, ___ met with this investigator to give his account of the strange goings on." Or, translating to contemporary usage, you could have the appearance of a name blacked out with magic marker. 

Yes, except "it" has some stress, I think: "2it was 1good." Yes, the t of "it" is held in the throat, in the sense that the glottis is closed during the t. A term for this is glottalization (though glottalization is also used for ejectives, which have an upward movement of the closed glottis). p and k are also glottalized before another consonant (written p', t', k'). Sometimes glottalized p', t', k' are referred to as unreleased, meaning there is no audible puff of air at the end of the stop closure. The lack of a release is a consequence of the glottis being closed. It's interesting to consider whether this glottalization affects the t part of the ch affricate (so-called). For me, it does, when the ch is at the end of a word. For many people, the t' before a consonant can lose its oral closure, leaving behind only the glottal closure, which is a glottal stop. p' t' k' can also lose their oral closure and hence turn into a glottal stop before a stop consonant at the same place of articulation (not before s though, at least for me). In this case, the oral closure of the cluster is simply delayed. 

Describing constructions by appealing to movement of constituents is part of traditional grammar. How can there not be movement? It seems evident that sometimes word choice is not independent of context, so CFG is doomed from the outset, because it is context free. In his profoundly influential classic Syntactic Structures, Chomsky introduced CFG only to knock it down. He offered there several empirical arguments that natural languages cannot be described by CFGs. Other such evidence has been found since, notably the cross-serial constructions investigated by Stuart Shieber. Once Gerald Gazdar had shown how it was possible to get past the difficulty of describing apparent movement in a CFG, the descriptive grammar of English that emerged from applying the theory, GPSG (Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar), had too many rules and categories. It seemed obvious that mere humans could not cope with the tremendous complexity of detail that seemed necessary to describe a natural language within the confines of CFG. 

I agree with some critics who think Minimalism is an awful theory, if it's even a theory at all. But I have a different diagnosis than some of what went wrong. We're looking at another incarnation of the long fight between Empiricism and Rationalism, or, that is, between the search for truth and the search for meaning. Chomsky is a rationalist, and looking for the truth seems to him useless if you can't find sense as well. So we wind up with a theory that tries and tries to make sense (opinions, of course, differ whether it does actually make any sense), but which apparently has no claim at all on the truth. If only Transformational Grammar had worked, our East Coast brethren wouldn't have gotten into this pickle. The notion that parts of expressions get moved around to make them easier to express (this is roughly McCawley's version of TG) makes perfect sense, to me: transformations mediate between thought and physiology. It makes syntax much like phonology. If it were true, both the empiricists and the rationalists would be pleased and could be happy together, with only an occasional squabble. But alas. It's not true. Things don't move around. This creates some tension among the theoretically minded. To make sense of things in face of the facts, or lack thereof, some have drifted off into a methodological heaven where the truth is discounted. Others retreat to descriptivism, or maybe just stay confused. My own view is that giving up on context free grammar was premature. 

This has been preying on my mind, and I have the beginnings of a design proposal for how to type in IPA. The basic idea is that you type in a phonetic character by typing an ordinary lower case character followed by zero or more uppercase characters. This capitalizes (so to speak) on the fact that it is rare in ordinary spelling that you would want to have a literal interpretation of "tI", for example, so it is feasible to treat this as a palatalized "t". And "tH" is an aspirated "t", "aN" is a nasalized "a", and so on. When you're typing things in interactively, you don't necessarily have to know everything about the system of interpretation, because you can see whether the result of your typing is giving you the phonetic script that you intended. And if it isn't what you want, you can backspace over what you typed and try something else. There should be a fallback that lets you type in a character with no obvious interpretation but which you can footnote to say what you want about the sound. 

In TSPE, McCawley often uses RNR as a test for constituency. The raised node must be a constituent. is tall passes this test: "Harriet knows that Kim, but doubts that Marcia, is tall." So if "is tall" is a constituent, what would it be other than a VP? I don't know what the problem is with using as a diagnostic, coordination with another VP. Theta theory is a poor cousin of Fillmore's Case Grammar theory, where subjects of various sorts arise as complements to the verb. (If you talk about theta roles instead of deep cases or semantic roles, you don't have to put Fillmore in your bibliography -- that's the point of theta theory.) I don't see the relevance to the question of whether "is tall" is a constituent. 

I think it is possible that every morpheme sometimes has a meaning. In "personalize", the "-ize" means "cause/make". But I can't find a meaning for "-ize" in your example "authorize", though etymologically it could have once had a meaning. Yet in both these examples, "-ize" is a morpheme, since removing it gives a word, and it has a secondary stress. "Of" sometimes has the meaning of possession, but in the nominalization of a transitive verb, it is appended just to satisfy the grammatical requirement that a noun may not take a direct object. "The eating of horse liver is not allowed." "A" expresses indefiniteness, except before a predicate noun, it seems to be there just to help locate the noun phrase. "She is a mailman."
