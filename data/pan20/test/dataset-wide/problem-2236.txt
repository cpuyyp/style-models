It is imperitive that they have fun while learning it. The training drill should not be too hard and demanding that they start hating it. Break up the training drill into smaller bits and encourage them to achieve goals set by you within in the timeline. Commend them on completing each step and make them hungry to learn more and do better. Eventually, this will reflect on the field during games as well. 

Source: Appendix 7.14 in ICC's T20I Playing Condition Handbook. The first time a tie-breaker at the end of the super over was applied was when Australia defeated England in the Womenâ€™s World Twenty20 game by the virtue of having hit more sixes than England during the game. 

In the said case, the batting side wins by 1 wicket. The last stumping will not count as the match is completed and the ball is dead as soon as the wide is bowled. I do not know of any match that has ended in this wide-stumping scenario. But in this India vs Sri Lanka game, India needed 1 run to win with the batsman needing 1 run to complete his century. The bowler bowls a no-ball and the batsman hits a 6. The six however does not count as the match ends as soon as the no-ball was bowled and the batsman is left stranded on 99. 

The ball just has to pass the hoop and not necessaily through the net. If the ball gets stuck in the net or breaks off the side of the net after the ball has passed the hoop from above, it still is considered a basket. The net is in place to slow down the ball after a basket has been made, so that there is no need to chase after it. Also it helps in making sure that a basket has been made as the ball slows down, thereby eliminating doubts when seen from certain angles. 

It's not very easy to say what you are doing wrong while bowling in indoor cricket. As a person who has never played indoor cricket, I cannot pin-point any differences. However, while I play with leather balls and tennis balls, I notice that there is a marked difference in batting and bowling techniques. Timing the ball is of utmost importance while batting in leather ball cricket and hitting the ball hard is optional, as timing can get the ball to the boundary with very little effort. However in tennis ball cricket, timing is obsolete and power is everything as the ball is very light comparatively and hardly has any momentum while travelling forward compared to a leather ball. I guess the same goes with indoor cricket, as there isn't a huge distance for the ball to be covered. The adjustment I try to make during bowling with a tennis ball is to knock off the pace for beginners, which forces genuine batsmen to use all their power in getting the ball over the infield or to the boundary. To tail-enders and players who find batting hard, I bowl with full speed which gives them less time to adjust to a particular shot, thereby increasing my changes of getting a wicket. The other adjustment is with the length. As there is no swing with a tennis ball, I drop try to pitch the ball on the short of length spot. This is basically to prevent the batsman from freely swinging his arms to a length/half volley ball. However, the margin of error in tennis ball is very less. Bowl a little forward, the batsman swings you over long-on/off. Drop the ball short and the ball literally stops and stands to be hit over cover or mid-wicket or hooked to the square-leg boundary. Apart from this, variety (quicker/slower deliveries, off/leg cutters, etc) also keeps batsman guessing as to what will come next and increases a chance of a dismissal. Considering that the balls used in indoor cricket are lighter than the actual leather balls used in outdoor cricket, the above tips might be of help. It takes a bit of practice and knowledge of the places where you can pitch the ball which can help you as you go along. This generally comes with experience. So, I guess the answer would be to play and learn as you go along with each practice session or match and thereby fine-tuning your bowling strengths to indoor cricket bowling. 

Retired Hurt: If a batsman falls ill or gets injured while batting, he may retire with the umpires permission. At the end of the teams innings, if this batsman does not return to bat, he is considered 'Retired Hurt' and is considered not-out. Statistics-wise, the runs scored by him will be added to his career total as well as the innings. However, as average is calculated by "Runs scored / ( Innings - Not outs )", the denominator would not be affected by this game, as he is still not out. As long as he has scored a run or more before retiring hurt, it effectively means his career average will be better at the end of the game than it did at the start of it. Absent-Hurt: This is a scenario where a batsman is not able to come to the pitch to bat even without facing a ball, due to prior illness or injury. In this case, no runs will be added to his career stats and therefore, will not affect this average as neither will the (Innings - not outs) change. So, his batting average prior to the game is the same as that at the end of it. Retired out: If a batsman retired without the umpire's consent and if he does not have permission from the opposing captain, then he is considered 'Retired-out'. This is considered as a dismissal. Only two batsmen have retired out in an international cricket Test match. Both instances occurred in the same match, with the Sri Lankan batsmen Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene retiring out. 

The third scenario of the question is treated as overthrows and the batsman will be awarded the combined runs of scenario 1 and scenario 2. In effect, he will score the number of runs run between the wickets plus a boundary. 

Brendan Rodgers has got some stability to the team and is in the process of rebuilding the team. They have promising youngsters coming through their ranks. Like it was mentioned in the question, there is no dearth of funds for the manager to spend. IMO, they should be a consistent top 4 side in 2-3 seasons if they can keep their key players and bring in proper talent during the transfer market. Winning the title, hmm, like they say, next year is their year ;-) (Forgive me, but I am a Man United fan) P.S: The answer is framed on my opinion only. It can be totally off the mark. However, there isn't any definite answer to the question and is only subjective. If there was, LFC would not have been in the position that it is in. 

There is no definition of being a "Test Match Specialist" per se, but yes, Peter Siddle has been labelled as one by the Australian selectors. The exact reason for this could only be given by the Australian selectors, but I can speculate and think of the below reasons: 

For the batting team - The review can be called by the batsman dismissed only. The captain has no say in this. For the bowling team - The review can be called by the fielding captain only. The rest of the team can consult the captain but cannot officially call a DRS review. In the case mentioned above, the batting captain cannot call for/cancel a review from the pavilion. It is the batsman's prerogative whether to take the review or not. 

On top of @kartshan's answer, the main reason that couple of batsmen are padded and waiting in the dug-out rather than the pavilion is that batsmen are dismissed as in in T20 cricket instead of the 180 seconds in other forms. 

There are four levels of offences - level 1, level 2, level 3 and level 4. Level one is for a lesser crime whereas level four is the most serious one. Arguing with an umpire about a decision can fall under level 1 or 2 depending on how aggressive or offensive the player is. Intimidation or assaulting the umpire falls under level 3 and 4. At the end of the match, the umpires file a report under which all these offences are documented. The match referee, on reading this report, sends a notification to the said player(s) and a disciplinary meeting is called where appropriate action (warning/fine/suspension) is taken against the player. Based on the frequency (over a 12 month period) and offence level, the fines vary. The fine-list can be found in Article 7.3 of the ICC Code of Conduct for players.
