If it is a government agency, probably face to face. Freedom of Information Act would allow the subpoena of instant messages...or in a case of a lawsuit against the agency, instant messages could be subpoenad. 

Depends how big the agency is. Could be few to a lot. If it is a larger agency you might find yourself in meetings deciding how things should be done or part of committees from several individuals that want to provide input and wish lists of features for the project you are working on. 

In a government job, most likely not. The agency has a staffing budget, and they cannot usually go over that budget without robbing from another agency. For example, yesterday was the 15th of April. The Tax Commission I work for received over 150,000 returns yesterday that need to process...and I am here writing this response from home. It will take us about 8 weeks to process those tax returns and no one is working overtime. It could take 6 months and we don't care. We get paid the same either way. And to some degree, there is some incentive to drag it out. If it takes too long to process, my boss can say hey, we need a larger budget. And then he could advocate that he needs a raise because he is now managing a larger department with more resources. If I was in the private sector and this much business suddenly came in the door, I would probably be working 15 hours a day to get the orders filled to generate revenue for the company. In many ways, government is run completely opposite of the private sector. 

On the upside, it sounds like you have plenty of time to find a job with a company that can handle such complicated HR procedures as not rejecting candidates the interviewers wanted to move forward with :) 

Just like everything else in software development, it depends. Question answered, right? ;) More specifically, it depends on what size of team you like working in and what kind of company you like working for. I think the team size thing is a bit of a red herring, the way the company is run can make just about any size team a great experience or a terrible one. 

Don't. Nothing good will come of telling your boss that he killed your motivation. You can tell him that you feel frustrated or that you're disappointed that someone else was chosen to lead the latest project, but you will not accomplish anything by telling him he quenched the last bit of your motivation. What he's likely to take from a statement like that is that you've given up on this company and that there's nothing he can do to make you happy so he shouldn't bother. If you do leave, I personally recommend staying neutral in your exit interview. Why burn bridges if you don't need to? Save the venting for your friends, stay professional while you leave. 

I doubt the person or persons interviewing you would even know what that means. Depends if the position you interviewed for is a position that was just created, or if they are filling an existing position. I would still argue that those facilitating the interview was given the task by someone to find the best candidate possible. ...not really knowing anything about software development. 

It's government. When was the last time you went to a government agency to try to take care of some personal business? Been to the Post office to mail a letter? How long did you have to stand in line? Did the person behind the counter care you were standing in line? Alternatively, how long did you stand in line at the grocery store? See the difference? 

As you said, you did everything you could. So, just relax and let the people in higher management perform their plans. That includes stopping to secretly work on this project. Let the people doing the communication with the client inform them that there are higher priority tasks, or whatever they want to say. As for your carrier and reputation - I see nothing wrong. If you are performing your tasks, your reputation will not be damaged. 

I was told exactly the same thing, and whatever you reply to his remark is actually irrelevant. Most likely (like 99%) you are not going to get the raise after such his reply. If you want to get a higher pay, you need to change the job: either in the same company by asking for more responsibilities, or in another company. 

They are government employees. Expect it to be pretty laid back. Not that you won't have work to do, and probably some kind of performance matrix. But usually this is just documentation that most government agencies have to keep to justify how and why tax dollars are being spent. 

One aspect that most everyone that have replied seem to have missed is that you applied and interviewed for a government job. You didn't specify which branch of government you applied for, or which and if it was Federal or State government. I have worked for state government off and on over the years and currently work for the Tax Commission for the state I live in. So as a government employee let me try to help you out... First you seem to have some ideals about what working in the real world is gonna be like. And from your post I get the sense that you are making some kind of life-long commitment. And maybe you are, Working for Government can be a pretty good gig in a lot of cases. You're basically guaranteed a paycheck and and the benefits packages are awesome. The downside is the hourly rate is less, and your work is well defined by your position so your work is gonna be in a narrow scope. In the private sector, your work is usually far more fluid based on what the company needs and/or client. In government, if something different is needed, they usually run to the legislature to ask for a budget. There is a lot of waste. In the private sector, the whole goal is to get things done with as small of a budget as possible. In government, the motivation of management is to get as big of a budget as possible. Also, if an agency does not use their entire budget they typically loose it. I've seen agencies blatantly waste money to keep from loosing their budget or a portion of their budget in the future. They want the argument that they spent all their money and that they need the same level of funding or more. Usually when a government agency opens a position, a small committee is formed to hire someone new. In most cases, I see 2 or 3 supervisors/managers from a department make up the committee. Sometimes larger, sometimes smaller depending on the size of the agency and a variety of other factors. I have been involved in these hiring committees a handful of times. We make a list of questions to ask during the interview. Sometimes we do open it up at the end for the interviewee to ask questions. And then we are done. So the interview process is very structured. far more structured than what it is in the private sector. That has been my experience. 

You kind of can't, you're going to get turned down for all sorts of reasons. That said, it will never hurt your career to network more. By networking I don't mean acting like some awful slimy stereotype of a salesperson, I mean going to stuff like meetups and user groups and trying not to be a jerk. If you're especially lucky you'll directly meet a manager looking to hire, but even if you don't it's quite likely that you'll meet people who know someone who is looking to hire and can put in a good word for you. It's not necessarily fair but people just trust a friend of a friend more than they do a total stranger. 

Don't worry, the interviewer isn't looking for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth here. All they really want to know is that you won't badmouth their company if they hire you and that you aren't the common denominator in all of your problems at your current company. Oh, and that you didn't get fired :) Or to quote this entertaining article about whether or not there is any incentive to give interviewers honest answers to certain questions: 

Yes, you and your coleague are doing it wrong. You will be able to work long hours for some time, but after you will start feeling exhaustion, being stressed out, and finaly the burnout. The quality of your work will worsen, and finaly you are going to become sick. If you work in an open office, the things are just going to be worse. Working more than 40 hours per week increases 'burnout' risk (read the comments how people gets hearth and other diseases, starts office fight, etc). Why Working More Than 40 Hours a Week is Useless : 

I work as a senior software engineer in Germany. In the last 6 years, I had at least 25 interviews. I was asked only once a puzzle question. Needless to say, whole interview was quite odd. My experience is that people do not ask puzzle questions anymore. At least not in IT sector. For example, in google “What works well are structured behavioral interviews, where you have a consistent rubric for how you assess people”. Even microsoft, where the puzzle questions were born, stopped asking such questions since they realized it is a waste of time. There is this famous article "What would Feynman do?", which discredit such questions in quite a funny way. 

Yes, it's a social custom. Somebody who goes to the trouble of buying a nice purse and taking good care of it doesn't want potentially gross floor grit staining it. It's also rude to move other people's things without asking permission. 

I can't say without knowing what field you're in. In my field, software development, that would be extremely unusual and probably a red flag. In other fields with high turnover, it could be normal to need new people immediately and to interview them ASAP. 

Whether you know this for a fact or whether you're assuming it based on your research, the way around it is networking. Go to local meetups for backend devs (if there aren't any in your city, starting one would look great on a resume), make a token effort to be friendly (offer to help tidy up and the organizers will love you), and you will meet people who either are hiring managers or who can introduce you to them.
