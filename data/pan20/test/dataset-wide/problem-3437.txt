The following has very little to do with your question, it is more of a reaction to what I perceive to be your anti-TTIP stance. If I am mistaken, apologies. I find that people who don't like TTIP focus on strange things even though there are some valid critiques. The paper you linked says that the gains are a result of, among other causes, a 

I guess it is possible to say something about expectations based on the exchange rate: $URL$ The euro is strengthening relative to the dollar since April. So I believe that either they think Greece will not leave the eurozone or that it will not have significant consequences. Either way, it seems that the USD/EUR exchange rate is not expected to fall. Of course surprising things do happen. This answer cannot extend to your personal finance problem, I do not know any of the details. (Even if I did, you are probably as wise as I am.) 

A trivial example to illustrate the difference: Let the function $A(x,y) \triangleq x \cdot y$ measure the area of a rectangle with sides the length of $x$ and $y$. Then the partial derivate w.r.t. $x$ $$ \frac{\partial A(x,y)}{\partial x} = y $$ measures how much the size of the rectangle would increase if I were to increase size x. Now imagine that I am interested in squares specifically, so I look at rectangles where if one size has length $x$, the length $y$ of the other size is $y(x) = x$. Then the function becomes $$ A(x,y(x)) = x \cdot y(x) = x^2. $$ If I now consider how much the size of the square would increase if I were to increase only one side, the answer is still $$ \frac{\partial A(x,y(x))}{\partial x} = y(x) = x. $$ (This is the definition of partial derivatives.) But if I want to consider how much the area of the square would change if I were to increase the parameter determining the length of both sides I should take the full derivative $$ \frac{\text{d} A(x,y(x))}{\text{d} x} = \frac{\text{d} x^2}{\text{d} x} = 2x. $$ Notice that in this case $$ \frac{\text{d} A(x,y(x))}{\text{d} x} \neq \frac{\partial A(x,y(x))}{\partial x}. $$ Hotelling's lemma tells you that some types of constrained optimization problems are magic because there this equation holds. 

The competitive equilibrium price does not necessarily maximize the amount of goods produced. (The answer to your actual question ends here.) What the competitive equilibrium price does is reach an efficient level of production. Any situation where the production level differs from the equilibrium level is Pareto-inferior to the equilibrium. This means that starting from the competitive equilibrium, you can transfer money from some of the market actors to other market actors in such a way that everyone will be better off than in the situation with non-equilibrium production levels. In the example you gave buyer 1 (reservation price 10) and seller 1 (reservation price 9) have a collective surplus of \$1, and buyer 2 (reservation price 3) and seller 2 (reservation price 2) have a collective surplus of \$1, meaning both pairs 'feel' they gained \$1 by trading. But in the competitive equilibrium, buyer 1 and seller 2 have a collective surplus of \$ 8. If they give buyer 2 and seller 1 one dollars each, everyone would still be more happy than in the other situation. So the second sale is in some way inefficient. A single price is not necessary to achieve Pareto-efficiency, for example first degree price discrimination yields the same results. 

Interesting! A possible way to resolve this contradiction is by taking cost reducing technologies into consideration. Perhaps (example with made up numbers follows) in 1960 a gallon of milk cost \$1 to produce, package and market. Due to strong competition, the consumer could get this for \$1.02, meaning a markup of only 2%. Today, due to technological advancements, the same gallon of milk's production, packaging and marketing cost could be lower, say \$0.80. However perhaps there is much less competition, and the markup is now 30%. This would make the consumer price of this gallon of milk \$1.04. The price jump from \$1.02 to \$1.04 seems negligible, something most people would call low inflation. (Especially if this took 60 years.) 

Does the discipline of economics have an accepted rigorous definition of capitalism? I.e. not something like "some economists would quote Hayek and say that so and so constitutes capitalism" but an if and only if definition that most economists would agree on. 

You chose a specific utility function to represent your Cobb-Douglas preferences. However there are other infinitely many others. All monotonic transformations of your utility function represent the same preference. Take $$ \hat{u}(x_1,x_2) = \left(u(x_1,x_2)\right)^{\frac{1}{a+b}} = x_1^{\frac{a}{a+b}} \cdot x_2^{\frac{b}{a+b}}. $$ As $\hat{u}$ is a monotonic transformation of $u$, it represents the same preference. It is straightforward to check that $\hat{u}$ fullfils the condition set forth in the wiki article. So there is indeed such a utility function, that also represents the preference, hence the preference is homothetic. 

I think there are some problems like this cooperative game theory. The one that jumps to mind is the Gale-Shapley algorithm. 

Argentina defaulted on its sovereign debt in 2002. It has reached an agreement with most but not all of its creditors. Wikipedia has a pretty good summary. The agreements included a 70% hair cut but also a RUFO or "Rights upon future offers" clause stating that if in the future agreement is reached with the holdouts with better terms (lower loss percentage) those better terms automatically apply to the creditors signing the current agreements. (This is similar to a most preferred customer clause.) Perhaps the Argentine government used this as a negotiation tactic as it makes it impossible to offer better terms to the holdout creditors. Unfortunately the holdouts bought a lot of CDS insurance and now stand to win more from a default then they do from a 100% repayment. Lawsuits lasted for years. Argentina made payments to the creditors it agreed with but made no payments to the holdouts. In 2014 (maybe 2015) a court blocked payments to the non-holdout creditors because you cannot differentiate between identical bonds in case of default. This is plunging Argentina into default again which is bad for the country and the creditors with whom it already came to an agreement. (There is another court hearing scheduled for April 2016 and the US government is advocating in favor of Argentina.) Why haven't the non-holdout creditors and Argentina signed a new agreement in 2014 without the RUFO clause but identical in all other ways? Seems like both of them would have benefited from it, just as they have by coming to an agreement in the first place. (I am not necessarily looking for the 'exact' or 'real' reasons. Any plausible reasons that make economic sense are fine.) 

If you want to impose sufficient conditions on the preferences, sadly it seems to me that this is nearly impossible. If a utility function describes a preference ordering then so does every monotonic transformation of the same utility function. If a utility function $U$ takes at least two values, say $a$ and $b$, you could use the following monotonic function $$ f(u) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} u & \mbox{ if } u \leq \frac{a+b}{2} \\ \\ u + 1 & \mbox{ if } u > \frac{a+b}{2}. \end{array} \right. $$ to get a new utility function $f(U)$ which would still describe the same preferences. However, this function will not be differentiable, even if $U$ was. The only way to guarantee that a utility function describing the preference ordering is always differentiable is if you do not allow any form of it to take two different values, that is if all the goods are neutral to the consumer. If you want to impose conditions on the utility functions itself it seems to me you would have to require that the marginal utilities exist and are continuous which is kind of the same as saying that the utility function is differentiable. So this is not a very useful condition. A better condition may exist, but I don't think it does. 

The Plaza Accord was implemented through market mechanisms. According to Wikipedia Central banks of the signatory nations spent $10 billion dollars. They exchanged these dollars for other currencies. This increases the supply of dollars and may even decrease demand if so far the central banks have been purchasing dollars. Due to the higher supply and not higher demand the 'price' or exchange rate of the dollar fell. At the same time the countries also implemented policy changes. This would effect the mid to long term exchange rates. The Japanese interest rate did indeed fall. $URL$ Mind though that the US interest rate also fell $URL$ 

I agree with @Alecos Papadopoulos that this is probably a marketing/product differentiation trick. You attract a specific type of consumers with a specific mindset. Another theoretical explanation also exists: This could be a version of second degree price discrimination. Costco may maximize its profits by selling at different prices to bulk buyers and small quantity consumers. If it would simply set two prices no one would make purchases at a higher price. By collecting a club card fee and then charging a lower price Costco can make sure that only bulk buyers will choose this option, thus achieving price discrimination. 

I am not sure I understand @spinkus's comment, as obviously not every solution maximizes the aggregate utility, but I will address the other point: Not trading. That is not at all important for me, I just wanted to make the example trivial. Suppose given some strictly monotonic utility functions $U_A,U_B$ and some initial endowments $w_A,w_B$ some allocation $a^*$ is a competitive equilibrium. If this allocation does not maximize aggregate utility we are done. If it does, consider the following monotonic transformation of $U_B$: $$ \hat{U}_B \triangleq c \cdot U_B $$ where $c$ is a positive number. In a pure exchange economy with $U_A,\hat{U}_B$, initial endowments $w_A,w_B$ the competitive equilibrium will again be $a^*$ as the preferences are unchanged. Yet even if $a^*$ maximized $U_A+U_B$, it clearly will not maximize $U_A + \hat{U}_B$ if $c$ is small enough. 

Short version: Economic decisions (investment, consumer spending) are based on expectations. The financial market is considered to be a good indicator of some future processes. When stock prices fall it represents a change in expectations which results in a change in economic decisions. Longer version: A key factor in the stock price of a company is the expected cashflow of said company. I would argue that if the stock prices fall then the expectation about the economic environment is that businesses will make less money than previously expected. This makes investment less profitable than before hence it will be reduced. (Note that it is here that we pass from finance to so called 'real' factors, things that are measured in physical goods.) Labor complements capital. The higher the capital the more productive labor is, and the more workers can be profitably employed. Because capital levels will not be rising as before, firms will not be hiring as much as before. In case of a significant stock price drop firms may even let people go. You can explain this with liquidity concerns, decrease in capital due to amortization, and a dozen other ways. Because of reduced (or reduced comparatively to prior expectations) employment people will have less income and will probably consume less. This can even result in a feedback loop that further decreases firms' profits. 

First I will just show that the 0.5 (or $\frac{1}{2}$) cut-off point does not work as a symmetric equilibrium, then you can decide for yourself if you want to think about the problem or read the complete answer. Let us denote the cut-off points by $c_x,c_y$. Suppose both players use the strategy $c = \frac{1}{2}$. Let us denote the numbers of player $x$ and $y$ respectively by $x_1$ and $y_1$ and their potential second number by $x_2$ and $y_2$. Suppose $x_1 = \frac{2}{3}$. By keeping this the probability that player $x$ wins is $$ P\left(\frac{1}{2} \leq y_1 < \frac{2}{3} \right) + P\left(y_1 < \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot P\left(y_2 < \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{2}. $$ This also means that $\frac{2}{3}$ is the median of this distribution. Now suppose $x_1 = \frac{1}{2}$. By keeping this the probability that player $x$ wins is $$ P\left(y_1 < \frac{1}{2}\right) \cdot P\left(y_2 < \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} $$ But if he would discard $x_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ he has probability $$ P\left(x_2 > \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{3} $$ of winning. $\frac{1}{3} > \frac{1}{4}$ so keeping $x_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ (and its environs) is not optimal therefore it cannot be an equilibrium move. 

Consider a curve with a negative slope (such as the demand function for a normal good). If you draw a second curve with a negative slope that does not intersect this one then it can either be in the "right-up" or the "left-down" direction from the first. When they talk about shifts they sometimes just mean this general direction where the new curve will be. Sometimes (as with taxes) there really is a shift. Let quantity be the vertical axis. If $D(p) = m - \frac{1}{p}$ then an increase in income will shift the demand curve up. But if $D(p) = \frac{m}{p}$ then an increase in income causes something that is not really a shift but a rescaling of the curve. You might still call this a shift up, as by moving up from the original demand curve you will reach the new one.
