clean, simple and comfortable. Don't wear anything that is to tight to restrict movement or to loose that may get in the way. Many weightlifters use Converse Chucks (canvas and a strip of rubber for the sole) and would probably prefer being barefoot. 

I have to agree that at this stage, from what you describe, moving from a 1 hr walk every other day to High Intensity Interval Training plan is probably not right FOR YOU at THIS TIME. The best way to lose weight is through diet, start with logging what you eat daily for 2 weeks (no cheating/excluding anything) - take a look, add the calories up and work out where you need to be. Here's a link to a daily intake calculator to help determine where you should be: $URL$ The next step is to increase your endurance and strength. Your approach of adding sprints to your walk is right on. I would suggest 5 day a week workout - 3 of walking and start to add some simple body weight exercises such as push ups, situps, squats - all body weight. Good Luck. 

Here's a link explaining it along with some other related neck exercises: $URL$ In Addition to that I would think adding Shrugs would be beneficial: 

Here's a link to an excel template that contains the basic format/info you would want to capture: $URL$ The idea is to set up your routine prior to the workout and track progress. My approach is a little simpler, I keep a small book, write down the exercises, check mark for each set and record the max weight.....I also put in how the workout was and how I felt. A journal could be used for many things, such as: tracking progress, sharing with a trainer, providing hints for changes, etc...but to me, the most important aspect is motivation - its good to see what progress you're making. 

The nice thing about dumbbells is that you can add them to many bodyweight exercises easily. Many body builders use dumbbells to help ensure that their routine/results are symmetric, each side of the body needs to lift the same amount - where barbells allow a person to 'cheat' and shift some of the load to one side of the body. If you put a good routine together, hitting each part of the body you should see good results from a dumbbell program in about 3 months (depending on your current state and intensity you go with). 

First, write down the goals you're trying to achieve: overall health, reduce weight, 5k run, etc. Then based on your goal, your ability to join a gym or get a personal trainer, the amount of time you have and your current health - you can ask again and the people here can give specific advice. 

I've read a few articles that the best way to gain muscle is Time under Tension (TUT) - none of the articles recommended whether it was TUT with heavy weights low reps or light weights and high reps....basically, there doesn't seem to be any 'standard' approach to max'ing the TUT. So my question is: based on your experience, is there a good TUT? does this change the temp I should be using (standard 2-0-2) to something more extreme (10-4-10)??? I remember reading some book about a 10 second miracle approach to muscle growth. Does this apply to hypertrophy? or to strength and power also? 

I have a 3-4 day a week weight workout plan, each day focuses on squats, bench press or deadlifts as the primary and some auxiliary exercises (overhead press, crunches, etc.). I've recently added very light exercises at the end of the main workout to help stretch out muscles, etc. with the hope of doing an active cool down and prep'ing for the next workout. For example, if today is bench press day and tomorrow deadlift, I might do some very light deadlifts or good mornings. I think this is helping in that the next workout I'm able to lift a bit heavier. The question: Is this post workout, light workout actually helping because it's stretching the next target muscle group OR is it mostly a psychological thing where my mind is focusing on the next workout sooner? 

You need to be at a certain athletic level in order to start a resistance program. Make sure you check with a Dr. prior to any exercise if you're in a high risk category (diabetes, etc.). my recommendation is to focus on your nutrition first, this will give you the ability and set the foundation for any exercise program you're interested in. 

Start light and every 2-3 weeks increase the weight with the goal of being able to complete all 5 x 5 sets/reps and if needed the last set downloading to a lighter weight to complete. You might want to change up the exercises from week to week, but each of the days keep the focus on those areas listed (you can add some arms to your legs day to break up 3 leg exercises in a row - but keep the focus where it should be). The 5 x 5 program allows more focus on strength/size than a 3 x 10 (set x reps) program that is more aerobic. Good Luck. 

Instead of instrumentation, I would recommend taking a weekly photo to show your progress. Unless you're a top athlete, monitors and tracking tools are more of a distraction than a help and any time spent on them instead of the workout is not helpful UNLESS you're an intermediate or top level athlete. 

Here's a link to some 'possible' issues with your squat: $URL$ From what I can see in the video, it's probably a combination of glute activation and hip flexor. My recommendation would be to try goblet squats ($URL$ and kettle bell swings ($URL$ for 2-3 weeks. Each of those weeks try the body weight squats every other day and see if there's improvement. 

First off - stop feeling bad for yourself or embarrassed. No one cares that you can't do a push up but you. See a Dr. about the pain, sounds like you pulled or tore something (if it was just muscle soreness it would be gone within a couple of days). Don't wait for it to get better - if it hasn't by day 3, it won't on its own. Second - get back to the gym and walk on a treadmill, or do what ever you can do without further hurting the injured area. Working out is 90% mental - you need to be consistent in your efforts. Work through the pain - but don't further injure yourself. You have a lot of muscles and - I'm sure - can find some other exercise to do while you're healing. 

My weights are out in the unheated garage. I've been on the 5/3/1 program for about 10 months and wish to continue through the winter, does anyone have any advice for training in a COLD environment? My routine is squats, bench press, dead lift and overhead presses (plus some side exercises). I'm expecting temps between -5 to 35f. 

I would recommend staying home mostly for the sake of the other gym members....don't pass the germs. Spend the time reading/reviewing your exercise plan and technique, you might not be able to lift as much, but you can focus on how you're lifting, using a broom handle to go through the motions. 

Here's an article from LiveStrong.com about muscle tremors: $URL$ Basically, without a proper medical examination, there is no way to tell if the cause is just lack of fitness or nutrition or something else. SO, step one: get a complete physical, step two find a local personal trainer to make sure you have a good/proper workout routine and associate diet. You can 'work through' or force yourself to continue, but this could lead to further issues - so, take a step back, your body is telling you something and you need a professional medical person to help understand what it's saying. I'm sure its nothing more than your current condition and diet. 

I've had (and continue to have on occasion) elbow pain, the biggest help I've found was using the TheraBand Flexiband product (here at amazon). Basically you're performing an eccentric exercise to reduce pain assoc. with tendinitis (aka tennis elbow). Here's a video showing the use: $URL$ Key short term help is rest and then exercise, use the theraband to reduce future injuries). 

I tried google'ing which muscles are used with the two pushup variations mentioned, but, besides the obvious focus on the knuckle and wrist for the knuckle pushup, I think there's more focus on the forearms and lats, where the palm seems more focus on the chest and shoulders. This is based on the hand position (similar to pull ups - from a full palm out pull up to a neutral hand position). Even doing pushups with your hands in the two positions you can easily feel the difference. There's about 12 pushup variations, including how wide you have your hands, so, for the best results try them all. Here's a link to some of the variations: $URL$ 

I'm currently working out 5-6 days a week, typically 3 days of weights and 2-3 of HIIT/Tabata. My focus is on strength and endurance training (not size). When I feel tired I take a day off...some days I work out twice. My questions is: What signs of over training should I be on the look out for? So far, I'm happy with my progress and overall health. 

Somedays (like today) I feel literally like I could move mountains! Is there any harm to pushing yourself harder on these good days? Just likes it's okay to slow down on the low energy days (I'm talking about going from 5 sets to 7 to 8 sets). 

You need to answer that question yourself, the way to get to it is, what is your goal? (this question to your question is taken from the great Dan John: $URL$ Are you more focused on cardio? or strength? What are you trying to achieve? Based on your response, you can determine which to do first - the first thing to do is what is most important to achieving your goals....where you focus your most energy. 

From everything I read, the question to ask yourself regarding doing a full body routine or split (focusing on various muscles during any one day's workout) is: Can I fully push/tax my various muscles in order to gain strength, size, etc. (dependent on your goals) at the same time OR do I need to focus on one major muscle group (chest, back, glutes/legs) at a time to get my results? So, if you're happy with your progress with a full body routine, stay with it. If you've maxed out your time/effort in a single workout and not seeing progress, either change what you're doing by adding weight or exercise or FOCUS (split). 

Thinking that you can ...get in shape really fast... is a first step in the wrong direction. It might take as long to get in shape as it did to get 'out of shape'. Here's a list of steps to success: 

Increased single lbs lift BUT decreased total lbs being lifted. What's the impact to strength, power, size and calories burned? So, basic question is, how do you determine the sweet spot where you still gaining overall (strength and power) while burning (short/long term) calories? 

Specific for the back, I would agree with VPeric - using a towel on doorknobs, I would also recommend looking at Ross Enimait's homemade isometric tool/workout: $URL$ Isometrics are VERY effective and with this device there's a wide range of back exercises (specific to your question) that you can do. 

I follow a version of the 5x5 program and have found it VERY helpful in developing strength with a side benefit of additional calorie burn (during/post workout). If your real focus is on weight loss - and I'll assume it body fat (BF%) loss you're looking for - you should really focus on your diet. A complete exercise program + diet is key to any weight loss (bf%) goal. The type of exercise is less important than the fact that you are including exercise in your bf% loss program. 

to provide specific advice we would need to know what happens after 65 - are you sore? hands numb? just tired? 

I'm not sure you're stating the question clearly...it's sort of asking: what's better salad or a restaurant..??..you can do yoga at home, the gym or a yoga studio - on the other hand a gym might be able to provide yoga, weight training, aerobic exercises, training classes, etc. Being healthy consists of a good diet and regular exercise...set some realistic goals, find out what type of exercise interests you and go for it. 

I read you previous post and wonder why you're not seeing a Dr. or a Sports Therapist to determine what the issue is with your knees. I go by the old advice of 'if it hurts, don't do it'. If you continue to run, you run the risk of doing more damage. If you do need to build up the muscles, tendons, etc. around your knees, I would recommend VERY light squats - and also look into the type of sneaker you're using for running and the surface you're running on.
