I think so. For example, one could start with faulty assumptions then rationalize one. Or, given the number of conspiracy theories, it's always possible one is true but not held as truth due to incomplete information. Let's attempt an argument, just for consideration of conspiracy theory in general. ================================================================================== There are a large number of conspiracy theories. Already demonstrated. Moreover, the public has access to imperfect information. For example, we know of the existence of certain top secret and classified programs. Likewise, there is some uncertainty regarding a few historical claims. Perhaps it is possible that, given the number of theories and existence of imperfect information, perfect information would shed greater light on an given one of the many conspiracy theories. That sounds somewhat reasonable I hope. Moreover, we know that some things we'd rather wish to be conspiracy theories actually aren't, like the CIA deposing of legitimate regimes throughout the developing world during the Cold War. Also, we know that, in the absence of clear evidence, people will tend to believe what the want to believe. For that reason, unpopular opinion shouldn't be categorically ignored. Wait! Maybe something that we don't know for sure the CIA did they actually did! Then we get to the fun part. Certain truths taken as given, such as the legitimacy of our governments, when called into question, even in the slightest, have broad ramifications for interpretation of other information. Maybe that's why they want Snowden! Maybe that's why the Supreme Court rigged the 2000 Presidential election! Maybe that's why the Federal Reserve is... I don't even know. Something. I bet the cartels are all backed the Bush family! They must be part of the Illuminati and the Knights Templar. Which means the whole GOP back to Lincoln must be too. He was probably a vampire hunter! That explains how that movie got released! (Hope that wasn't too harsh) Oh my gosh it's turtles all the way down! I suppose that isn't an entirely unreasonable argument. I'm guess with enough research and enough bias you could fairly well satisfy the requirements for rationality of any one of the conspiracy theories, but I'd rather not lend any weight to them (in most cases even if they are true) so I'm not going to do that here. ================================================================================== Side note: 

Do you believe that your position on abortion is something that you believe should be a universal law? Do you think it is an unquestionably good position for all? Does it align with a pre-existing universal truth? (For example, Never Lie). If so, you are, for the most part, obligated to act in accordance with your position. Kant is too heavy to capture in a paragraph, but the above isn't a terrible intro. I think Kant is limited and deliberately ignores realities that he doesn't like, but for the most part, you won't damage yourself following his philosophy. 

I'm not sure what you mean when you say, . Much of how I would respond would be determined by the context in which your question is asked, but as a stand alone argument, "How can death matter to the dead person?" is solid; it just depends upon what it is being used to argue for. We can assume that this paper doesn't expect the post-death states (hell/heaven) to exist - or at least that they are not relevant for his argument. So we can cross those out - or at least we should cross them out if we are going to find a logical place to stand in defining a response. It is not wrong to consider hell or heaven as a counterpoint, but they are only useful in poking holes in the argument - the existence of heaven or hell is not known and therefore shouldn't be the backbone of any refutation. Aside from that, there are several points to consider: Does it matter if all plant and animal life dies out? The answer is less obvious than the author of the essay suggests. On one hand, if we all die simultaneously without any pain or suffering, then to every human being it should matter exactly none. Why? "How can death matter to a dead person?" There is no one left to suffer the loss of anyone else, and thus there is no one left to suffer; no resounding pain; no sense of loss; just silence. I have often thought to myself that the thought of my own death seems sad - if only for the mental image I have of people suffering after I'm gone. But if I die AND so does everyone else; there is no sadness. It just is. That said; the author's definition of mattering is unclear. Upon inspection, the 'not mattering' argument can be used anywhere. If human life seems to matter - does that lack consequences apart from those felt by other humans? If so, then it doesn't matter if I suffer - since my suffering will surely cease when I die - and so forth. If we elevate as the pinnacle of all , then we can argue that live or die, nothing matters at all, since we are inherently insignificant - so much so that as soon as our species disappears, goes with it. In other words; if the only thing that matters is what matters to humans; then what matters doesn't matter that much at all. If, however, we allow for the possibility that while human is important to humans, there maybe greater than those we can observe from our constrained human viewpoint, then perhaps the death of all life on earth matters a great deal. We can't know this either way; and the author knows this. What we can know is that one's being and existence can be given by the perspective that they subscribe to. The being and existence of one who believes that all life dying would be superior to somebody dying is going to be different than the being and existence of one who considers that there is some greater that gives human existence value. I don't know which way of being would be preferable, or whether either view provides an obvious state of existence that accompanies said view; I can only infer that one's existence would differ depending where they stood. 

Well if there were actually people out there that could perform such magic, the probability of meeting one would scale with the power of their magic in theory. Then, the God of Pascal's wager is just a Pascal mugger (or blesser) with infinite power. By Robin Hanson's criteria, this infinite power confers an infinite improbability. ================================================================================== 

All crime is preventable by government. Implement nuclear holocaust, exterminate all human life, crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Well, maybe that's not what we want to do. Maybe we want government to guarantee certain rights. Say one of those is the right to life (the government loses the death penalty). Sterilize all humans. Wait for the second to last person to die. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Okay, maybe we need a right to procreate. Distribute all humans in such a manner they can never interact with each other, but provide for IVF. Without the possibility of any human interaction, all crime rates drop to zero per unit time. Perhaps we want to have a right to live anywhere we choose. Sedate all humans such that they are incapable of any action. All crime rates drop to zero per unit time. This method requires autonomous care-takers. These might seem like unreasonable arguments, so I would ask - what is the fundamental philosophical difference between between these methods and a totalitarian police state? To me, there isn't one, and one of the reasons I think this question even came up is that some people today live under governments that do not guarantee sufficient rights that they have rights as a reason to not guarantee zero crime. The point being, all crime is preventable by government. What then, are the restrictions on crime prevention: 

The problem with that statement is two-fold. First - and I think this is a nice illustration of the importance of semantics - the word is misleading. For instance, I depend on my legs to walk, and walking (ignoring artificial means here) depends on legs, but neither walking or legs depend on the fact that long ago something created them (ignoring here that existence of legs depend on the creator or origin - that is not the point). So depends is a tricky word. But I think you are intending to have depends mean something like exists within the confines and context created by the creator. That's an acceptable use of the word depends for the purposes of the question. But that assumption has a problem. It implies that it is known that humans (for that matter anything) are limited by barriers that exist within them from their creation. That is to say; it implies that nothing can be created that can itself create; and can create beyond the bounds of the limitations imposed by their creator. (I won't debate now whether or not anything can - I'm just pointing out here that the implication is neither proven nor generally accepted). 

I would argue that there is an implicit trade-off between bias and decisiveness, similar to trade-offs between accuracy and precision. I take the following to be an unbiased statement. 

(b) Objective standards are fundamentally pointless. Well relativism doesn't really specifically address whether objective standards have a point or not. Mainly, it places limits on societies to practice imperialism but in no way enforces the validity of this belief. So, for example, while a cultural relativist will not take a strong stance against sexism, relativism does not innately reject this stance as wrong or useless, merely as unreasonable. (c) What has happened in the past is irrelevant Cultural relativism, to me, seems to have two purposes: 

Yet this strays from my point. I've found that when people find fault with the beliefs of another, in the words of James Carse: 

I think you need to get underneath your assertions a little. While all of your ideas about 'life, the universe, and everything' are philosophically acceptable ideas, they bare no resemblance with your experience of life. You don't experience your life as being just a cluster of atoms interacting; nor do you experience your life as having no purpose - you might not experience some profound meaningful purpose, but you experience purpose in your everyday actions, e.g. catching the bus on time; getting something to eat; getting an A on a test, etc. Even the notion of searching for a rationalization for our motivation implies we freely choose to enter into motivated states, and that we fully understand why he have chosen to do so. If we are just chemical sacks, then why not just say that the particular chemical sack called a person by the other person-shaped chemical sacks exhibits behavior that the other chemical sacks define as 'motivation'. Even the view that the universe is devoid of meaning, random atoms interacting, infinitely large and uninterested is still a view. Its not wrong - but its not right either - it just a view. So your question can only answered from within the narrow framework of a particular set of beliefs. Since no person experiences life as you describe it, then all were dealing with is a set of philosophical ideas - and while those ideas may make up the particular stance that a person chooses to take - if that person tries to answer the question from within that viewpoint, they aren't answering as a whole person; they're answering from an idea as an idea. The question can only be answered as an abstraction within an abstract context rendering it fundamentally meaningless outside of a perversely narrow scope. In other words, its like a crossword puzzle. 

Data is what information in encoded in as symbols on the tape of a universal Turing machine for model in which the Universe runs on a Turing machine. Information would be the location and velocity of all particles in the Universe as well as any knowledge derived from that. Data is uninterpreted encryption of that information. ================================================================================== It was not my understanding that philosophy functioned on meaningful different (rather just more specific) definitions than general language on this issue. The definitions of each per Google here: 

Oh no, you asked an extension question about taking a position. Well that makes this harder. I would argue that being sufficiently informed to produce a position on any issue will necessarily introduce non-zero bias. However, we may be able to further refine our answers. For example, perhaps we can eliminate one of the above cases with the following definition: 

I like how you broke it down in that fashion. And it's a great question. I have struggled with this myself. There are lot of different contexts from which one can approach this question. I don't know the answer, but I know several ways of looking at the question that might be valuable. 

I think the difficulty in answering this question both validates the question and negates it at the same time. To even begin, we must ascertain what we mean by truth. Can anything actually be seen as a permanent infallible truth? Try as we might, we can only get perspectives; points of view; opinions. Even something trivial like "You need water to live", is just a highly probable assumption based upon considerable evidence and experience. It is not possible to know with certainty whether or not we have considered all points; whether there is something not yet understood or considered. Also trueness or truth ignores the passage of time as a contingency. Whether something is or is not true right now and whether or not it will be true tomorrow, are two different - even at times contradictory - assessments. From a philosophical standpoint, it is impossible to speak of truth or untruth without contradicting your own logic. Like Alan Watts said, "It's like trying to bite your own teeth or look at your eyes without a mirror." But...only from a philosophical standpoint. I have found the following way of thinking to serve me well. I think it is critical to question and pull apart my own assumptions. The more radically, I can disrupt my own habitual patterns of static assumption and certainty, the more space I have to consider and to see my own erroneous views. It is the same principal as solving a Koan. However, that said, John Stuart Mill stated (the only useful thing he ever said), "There is not certainty, but there is certainty sufficient for human life". And that's about right. If you don't pull apart the illusions that blind you, you will never know what's possible beyond "truth" - but if you try and walk on water before you can clearly see that it's not true that you can't, then you will drown quickly. That there is nothing true should become common sense if you think on it, but the way in which you use that thought or that thought uses you is what is critical. 

Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

This is a very great story. I read it in the same way I'd read a gripping thriller - the same sort of anticipatory attention. At any rate, it was fun. Bad news. There are almost never absolutes in life. There are always conditions where it is necessary or at least considerably saner to break a promise. However the trouble with your situation may reside more in where it arises from. It's comforting to think our memory delivers an accurate recounting of events - after the passage of time you are able to better reflect on what transpired and view the issue newly with the analytical prowess of an adult (or of a wiser person;etc). However there are numerous biases associated with memory that skew the way we interpret our memories. It is just as likely that your brain conjured up evidence to support the way you want to see things. Since you are a person for whom integrity is at least somewhat important, the negative impact of keeping this promise is something - at least on the surface of your awareness - that you are willing to endure. Because it is not okay for you to break a promise, there must be a very good "reason" to justify breaking one - maliciousness by one of the parties involved is one of the best justifications that there is. This allows you to maintain a positive image of your own integrity while at the same time doing what you want. Now - everything I just said might be horsesh*t - I don't know; I just made it up. But, it illuminates something about the nature of promises. Imagine what justifications there were for Jackie Robinson to break his promise not to fight back; for Ghandi to break his promise of non-violence; etc. It is a matter of choice - what is more important? Or said another way - what will you choose to honor? Will you honor the conjurings of your mind - or will you honor your word? Still, with all that beind said - I don't know the answer; and any absolutes about situational ethics received from someone who doesn't know the whole story and found out about your situation from an internet forum should be taken with a grain of salt. I do know this: You already know the answer. You will find something in these posts to justify or support what you were already going to do.
