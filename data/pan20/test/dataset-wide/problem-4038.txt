Proof. Let $a$ be a point of $\ell \setminus A$: such a point exists, since the points of $A$ are not collinear and $\ell$ contains $q+1$ points. There are $q$ lines different from $\ell$ through $a$ and at most $q-2$ points in $A \setminus \ell$; thus there are two distinct lines $\ell_1 , \ell_2$ through $a$ disjoint from $A$. Let $b'$ be any point of $A$ not contained in $\ell$ and let $b$ be any point not contained in $A$ on a line $\ell'$ joining $b'$ to a point of $A$ contained in $\ell$; there are $q$ lines through $b$ different from $\ell'$ and only $q-1$ points in $A \setminus \ell'$; we deduce that there is a line $\ell_3$ through $b$ disjoint from $A$. Thus the triangle formed by $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$ is a blocking set disjoint from $A$. $\square$ Corollary. 

An immediate comment is that, in the case of smooth manifolds, the notion that you suggest needs to take into account more than just the differentiable structure of $X$ and $Y$: any two smooth, connected, projective curves of the same genus $g \geq 2$ are diffeomorphic, but there is a flat morphism (in the usual sense) between them if and only if they are isomorphic as complex varieties. Since there is a family with $3g-3$ parameters of complex structures on curves of genus $g$, there seems to be the need for more structure to be encoded in the notion of an analogue of flatness. On the positive side, I have always thought that Morse functions have a feel similar to flat morphisms: while they do not seem to preserve the "numerical" character of flat functions (e.g. fibers may sprout off extra components), they nonetheless impose a certain bound on the variations of the fibers. More concretely, if $X$ consists of $g+1$ disjoint circles in the plane with centers along the $x$-axis (no two of which are contained in one another) and $Y$ is the $x$-axis, then I tend to think of the projection of $X$ onto the $x$-axis as the "real picture" of the degree two morphism from a curve of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$. In this case, the projection is a Morse function and the morphism I think of is a flat morphism! To make the analogy more precise, you would probably have to impose some condition on the critical points to take into account the "automatic orientability" of the complex case: I am not sure that I would consider "flat" a Morse function from $S^1$ to $\mathbb{R}$ having more than two critical points. This might give a way of "curing" the issue with extra components appearing in fibers. 

You may want to look at curves in three dimensional projective space. I vaguely remember, although I may be wrong, that there was a component with general member non-reduced. 

It's probably a very simple question but I am not sure about the reference. In the definition of a balanced monoidal category we require that the braiding isomorphims $$c_{V, W}: V \otimes W \to W \otimes V$$ are not arbitrary but admit twisting isomorphisms $\theta_V: V \to V$ which, in a way, represent $c_{V, W} c_{W, V}$ as a coboundary. Does it mean that from the homotopy point of view, existence of a twisting makes the category symmetric monoidal in the sense of $\infty$-categories? 

Let $E$ be a rank $r$ bundle on a quasiprojective scheme. There is a natural map $$ \Lambda^r H^0(E) \to H^0(\Lambda^r E) $$ It does not have to be surjective as can be seen from the case when $E$ is a direct sum of line bundles. However, is it true that $E$ can always be twisted by an ample line bundle so that this map becomes surjective? 

Let $[x:y:z:w]$ be the homogeneous coordinates on $\mathbb{P}^3$ and suppose that the point blown up is given by the vanishing of the first three coordinates. Introduce a projective plane with coordinates $[X:Y:Z]$ then the blowup is a closed subset in $\mathbb{P}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^2$ given by the equations $$ xY = yX; xZ = zX; yZ = zY. $$ The bundle $\mathcal{O}(1) \boxtimes \mathcal{O}(1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^3 \times \mathbb{P}^2$gives the Segre Embedding, so it is very ample on the product of projective spaces. Its restriction to the blowup is also very ample and it must be of the form $dH - k E$. We can computed $d$ and $k$ by intersecting with (a) a line in $\mathbb{P}^3$ that avoids the point blown up, which gives $d = 2$; and (b) with a line in the exceptional fiber $[0:0:0:1] \times \mathbb{P}^2$, which gives $k=1$. So $2H - E$ is very ample. 

I believe that the answer is "no". Let $A := S^1$ be the unit circle and let $W \colon S^1 \to S^1$ be a rotation by an irrational angle. Thus $W$ defines an action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $S^1$ all of whose orbits are countable. For each point $p \in S^1$ define $S(p)$ to be the "backwards orbit of $p$", namely $S(p) := \{ W^n(p) | n \leq 0 \}$. Applying $W$ to a point $p$ we find that the set $S(W(p)) = S(p) \cup \{W(p)\} \supsetneq W(p)$. Since this holds for every point of $p$, we find that there is no point with the required property. 

I think that the quartic with equation \[ x^4 + y^4 + xy^2z + yw^3 + z^3w \] over $\mathbb{F}_2$ has no line and that it has no conic defined over a field of size at most $2^8$. Both statements I have checked using a computer, so there could be mistakes in the program I used, but I did some testing for the algorithm to decide existence of lines. For the algorithm for conics, I could never get it to finish, this is why I resorted to brute force search for some conic defined over a small field. If the example above works, then any quartic with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$ reducing to the one above modulo two, also has no line and no conic on it. Also, if it works, it is the only one with at most five monomials, up to isomorphism. 

I have $n$ positive definite Hermitian matrices $M_n$ and I want to define and compute their median. These matrices correspond to independent estimations of a covariance matrix in the presence of some noise I cannot quantify, hence the desire to use a median as opposed to a mean (non gaussian residuals / outliers). I could: (1) look for a positive definite Hermitian matrix that minimizes $d(M,(M_k)) = \sum \|M-M_k\|_1$. (2) or I could look a the eigen decompositions $M_k = Q_k \Lambda_k Q_k^T$ (with $\Lambda_k$ sorted) and define $\Lambda = med\ \Lambda_k$ and $Q$ as the orthogonal matrix that minimizes $d(Q,(Q_k))$. (3) or simply look for the closest (for norm $\|.\|_2$) matrix to the matrix of the element-wise medians. Not sure if anything smart can be said about this... thanks for any help. 

Consider the following problem: Given $\Omega$ and $U$ two symmetric definite positive matrices, choose a matrix $K$ to minimize the expectation $x' \Omega x + x'K'UKx$ when $x$ follows the invariant distribution of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process: $dx_t = -K x_t dt + \Sigma dW_t$. The intuition of the problem is straightforward: there is a penalty on $x$ for the metric associated to $\Omega$ and a penalty on $Kx$ for the metric associated to $U$. The solution of this problem is $K^* = U^{-1}(U \sharp \Omega )$ with $U \sharp \Omega$ the geometric mean of $U$ and $\Omega$. I can get this result by a convoluted way: expressing the variance of the invariant distribution of $x$ as a function of $K$ and $\Sigma$ (it gives the Algebraic Riccati equation as a constraint) and then solving the optimization problem under this constraint. Given that the solution involves the mean of my two matrices $U$ and $\Omega$ for the Riemannian metric on positive definite matrices, I am looking for more elegant proofs of this result: something along the lines of "the total cost is the sum of two costs which correspond to some distances in a well defined space and by minimizing the sum of these distances, we end up with a geometric mean..." 

[EDIT: A previous version mistakenly argued that the fundamental group of X was responsible for torsion in the Picard group. I hope that this is correct now! Btw, there is probably a more direct way of arguing, but I cannot find one at the moment.] The Picard group of X is torsion free if and only if the group ${\rm H_1}(X,\mathbf{Z})$ vanishes. By the exponential sequence, the torsion in the Picard group of X comes from the torsion in ${\rm H^2}(X,\mathbf{Z})$ and from ${\rm H^1}(X,\mathbf{C})/{\rm H^1}(X,\mathbf{Z})$. Thus the vanishing of ${\rm H_1}(X,\mathbf{Z})$ is equivalent (by the Universal Coefficient Theorem) to the torsion-freeness of the Picard group of X. ADDED (for explicitness) To make everything more explicit, assume that X is non-singular. The Picard group of X may contain torsion coming from two different sources. There might contain torsion in the connected component of the identity, and this is recorded by the torsion free part of the first homology group. Or there might be torsion in the component group of the Picard group, and this is recorded by the torsion in the first homology group. In terms of the exponential sequence, the first kind of torsion appears in the image of ${\rm H^1}(X,\mathbf{C})$, while the second one "appears" in torsion in ${\rm H^2}(X,\mathbf{Z})$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem implies that the "combination" of these two groups is the whole first integral homology group. An example of torsion of the first kind is already present in the case of curves of genus at least one: the Jacobian of the curve contains plenty of torsion bundles. An example of torsion of the second kind is the case of Enriques surfaces: the canonical divisor on such a surface is a torsion line bundle that is non-trivial. If the characteristic of the ground-field is different from two, the corresponding cover of X is a K3 surface. 

(Trying to rephrase an earlier question) In topology, a continuous map $f: X \to Y$ has a ``homotopy cofiber" $Cf$ included in a cofiber sequence $$ X \to Y \to Cf \to \Sigma X \to \Sigma Y \to \Sigma CF \to \ldots $$ when $f$ is a cofibration, the cofiber is homotopy equivalent to $X/Y$. Now, if $Y$ is a category, say, of modules over a ring $R$, and $f$ a functor from another category (e.g. embedding of projective modules into all modules), is there a similar cofiber category and a cofiber sequence? 

Some comments (1) On this site there was a question "Why a smooth surjective morphism of schemes admits a section etale-locally?"; so smoothness gives some kind of nice property here. (2) Even for smooth morphisms, over complex numbers one may not have a Zariski local section (even in the case when the fiber is a projective space). (3) For an arbitrary morphism there is no hope for a global section - consider the case of a blowup of a point on a projective space. 

Unless you know that $F'$ has a finite locally free resolution, and this will tend to fail when $F'$ is the skyscraper sheaf of a singular point. But maybe you just want to work with $G$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $X$.
