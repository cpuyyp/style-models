Silicon carbide is covalent and can be synthesized at atmospheric pressure by the Acheson process. Temperatures may actually be somewhat higher than your range but are easily achieved by the process. 1,4 dichlorobenzene (used in moth balls) is a compound that forms crystals at low temperatures. I think the molecules in the crystal are joined only by weak bonds so I don't know if that is what you are after. 

Why do they change directions so radically? Does this occur in other parts of the world or are North American hurricanes the anomaly in their typically smooth tracks? 

I believe it is a very large chert nodule that has weathered out of limestone. Was it found near the limestone area of the island? The hardness indicates it isn't a concretion. If your saw blade did not have carbide or diamond on the edge, it wouldn't cut chert which is a type of fine-crystal quartz. 

I don't totally understand what you are asking but yes there was soil in the Archean. In some locations around the world, these soils were buried and preserved as paleosols. The Archean paleosols are very important in studying the origin of the atmosphere because the oxidation state of the minerals is an indicator of the presence or absence oxygen and other gases in the atmosphere (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014) 

There is no reason you couldn't have uranium deposits in the continental shelf. Certain types of deposits wouldn't occur or be likely to persist in that environment but other types such as those in Archean metasediments likely could be found. As pure speculation, I can envision formation of deposits similar to unconformity or roll-front deposits where deep-circulating groundwater discharges through organic-rich ocean sediments. The organic material would cause the uranium to precipitate in a reduced oxidation state. That would likely be up on the shelf so I don't know if you could make it work if you want to be down on the edge of the shelf. 

Autoregressive models are mathematical models, and like all models, are based on a conceptual model of the system. The conceptual model is that prior flow is a parameter in prediction of current flow. So it doesn't really make sense to have a model where it does not do so. Furthermore it is difficult to conceive of a natural system where prior flow is not a predictor. This is where I disagree with Gordon's answer. Even in small catchments, prior flow is a good surrogate for the physical conditions that contribute to flow. The conditions include precipitation history, soil moisture, filling of depressions so flow can accumulate, capacity for trees to intercept precipitation (are the leaves already wet), water-table stream connectivity, etc. If you don't see a relationship to prior flow in small catchments, that may just mean your daily timestep is too large. I care about the flow variation in very small catchments and monitor the flow on 30-minute intervals. 

The Roadside Geology of Virginia by Keith Frye is one of a series of books about geology in different states. It probably would be a good place to start to explore different geologic features. 

The heat goes away in two main ways. The first is radiation as mentioned in a comment. Heat radiates away into space or it may warm the air before it gets to space. That leads to the second reason heat goes away - convection. Weather systems move air from one place to another. The hot air literally blows away or rises and is replaced by cooler air that blows in. Where there is mixing, the warm air warms up the cooler air so the mixed air approaches the same temperature. There are a couple of other ways that heat is lost. First, water in lakes and rivers evaporates so you get evaporative cooling like a swamp cooler. That is most noticeable in summer but happens at a slower rate as air temperature decreases and as the sun stays up for fewer hours in the autumn and stays lower in the sky. Plants transpire water vapor from their leaves and that has the same effect as evaporation. The other way is by melting snow or ice. When snow falls on warm ground early in the winter, the ground has retained enough heat to melt the snow. This cools the ground to the point where the snow will stick. 

Although garnet is hard it can fracture and break apart. As the rest of the rock erodes as it tumbles around in the high-energy environment that rounded the cobble, any bits that might stick up can break off so the rock is smoothed. The difference in hardness isn't enough to make the crystals stick out. Ideally, when testing hardness you try to scratch the mineral with something of known hardness and try to scratch something of known hardness with the mineral. 

Geographers may or may not be Earth Scientists. It is a broad field and includes human geography, cultural geography, economic geography, transportation geography, and other sub-disciplines that are not studies of the physical nature of the earth. 

Ecosystem benefits of submerged trees include providing growth locations and nutrients for algae, phytoplankton, molusks, and other organisms. They can provide, not only protection for fauna, but shading for refuge from heat. They can increase eddies and areas of low flow that can be beneficial for fish and other fauna. Some species take advantage of pools formed behind downed trees in streams. They can increase sedimentation by trapping sediments or decreasing flow and this can have a negative impact on species that require a gravel stream bed. They can increase flooding which may have positive or negative impacts on people and the ecosystem. Snags in waterways are an issue for large boats, restricting access or causing damage in collisions, as mentioned in another answer. But they can also be deadly to small boats like kayaks and canoes. The water flows through the limbs of downed trees and the surprisingly strong hydraulic pressure can trap boaters underwater in these "strainers". This can happen with stream current or tidal flow. 

Not definitive, in the absence of more information regarding hardness and location where it is found, but Your specimen appears to be a limonite or hematite pseudomorph after galena or fluorite. Hematite is iron oxide and limonite is iron hydroxide, so they have red to yellowish rusty colour. A pseudomorph is where one mineral is replaced by a different one. Galena is lead sulfide and fluorite is calcium fluoride and they often form masses of cubic crystals like you have. So you end up with hematite or limonite looking like it has the same cubic crystal form. edit: The weight suggest hematite instead of limonite but there could also be galena remaining below the surface. Galena is very dense so if you could measure the specific gravity, you should be able to tell.
