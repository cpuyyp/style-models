Let $Q_n$ be a $n\times n$ matrix with $Q_n=\begin{pmatrix} -\lambda_1-\mu_1 & \lambda_1 & 0 & \cdots\\ 0 & -\lambda_2-\mu_2 & \lambda_2 & \cdots\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots& \vdots\end{pmatrix}.$ In other words the diagonal of $Q$ is $\{-\lambda_i-\mu_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and superdiagonal is $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^{n-1}$. Also, $\lambda_n=0$. Letting $\mu=(\mu_1,\cdots,\mu_n)^T$, I need a fast way of calculating: $$f(t):=p\exp(Qt)\mu,$$ where $t$ is a scalar and $p=(1,0,\cdots,0)$. I know there are a lot of matrix exponentiation algorithms but I'm hoping for one that could exploit the nice structure here. I would be happy with approximations, so long as there is good control of the maximum error. I was thinking of maybe trying to find a Jordan decomposition $Q=A+N$, where $A$ is diagonalizable and $N$ is nilpotent but this seems difficult. Generally speaking, $Q_n$ will be diagonalizable as long as the diagonal entries are all distinct. However, I'm worried that when two values are close, there's a chance of high error. Motivation: $f(t)$ is the density of a Coxian PhaseType distribution and for doing MLE it would be really nice to have a fast way of calculating $f(t)$. 

I believe the common name for such graphs is rigid. In fact, most random graphs are rigid. See this reference: On the minimal order of a graphs within a semigroup. 

Grimmett and Stirzaker's Probability and Random Processes fits the bill: $URL$ It covers everything up to stochastic calculus without measure theory. 

The Nakagami can be seen as a rescaled chi-distribution, so it's square is a chi-square distribution, which is stable under addition. 

Let $f(\lambda)$ count the number standard young tableaux of shape $\lambda\vdash n$ and $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\cdots,\lambda_r)$. Let $\mu \vdash k$ be a partition for $k<n$. It is a consequence of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule that: $$\chi^{\lambda}_{(\mu,1^{n-|\mu|})}=\sum_{\alpha\vdash |\mu|}\chi_{\mu}^{\alpha} f(\lambda\backslash \alpha),$$ where $\chi_\mu^\lambda$ is the irreducible character. This is invertible, giving: $$f(\lambda\backslash \alpha) =\sum_{\mu\vdash k}\frac{\chi_\mu^\alpha}{z_\mu}\chi_{\mu 1^{n-|\mu|}},$$ where $z_\mu$ is the central character. I'm trying to understand the nature of $f_m:=f(\lambda\backslash 1^{r-m})$ for $m=1,2,\cdots,r$. Obviously these can be computed by the Aitken determinent formula but I'm much more interested in them from a representation theory point of view. Specifically I'd like to consider restrictions of the above sum to just $f_m$. So for example, is there an interpretation for: $$(?)=\sum_{m=1}^{\lambda_1}\chi_{\mu}^{\alpha} f_m?$$ I'm not sure if it's wise to just fix $\mu$ here. Have such things been considered before? 

I recently read the following "open problem" titled "Pennies on a carpet" in "An Introduction To Probability and Random Processes" by Baclawski and Rota (page viii of book, page 10 of following pdf), found here: $URL$ "We have a rectangular carpet and an indefinite supply of perfect pennies. What is the probability that if we drop the pennies on the carpet at random no two of them will overlap? This problem is one of the most important problems in statistical mechanics. If we could answer it we would know, for example, why water boils at 100C, on the basis of purely atomic computations. Nothing is known about this problem.” I was wondering if this problem goes by a more popular name and whether or not some form of progress has been made on it. In particular, references would be highly appreciated! 

So lets turn now to the construction of a $B$ with the required properties (1) and (2) above. We construct $B$ in countably many steps where after step $n$ we will have completely defined $B_0, B_1, \ldots, B_n$ and finitely many other bits of $B$ (i.e. finitely many bits of finitely many $B_i$ where $i > n$). For step $0$, let $B_0$ be an arbitrary real satisfying condition (1). Given $k \leq n$, let $m_0, \ldots, m_j$ be the elements of $\{m \in \mathbb{N}: m \notin A \lor m \geq k\} \cap \{0, \ldots, n\}$, and define $C_{k,n} = B_{m_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{m_j}$. After each stage $n$, we will have ensured that $C_{n,k}$ is $(k+1)$-generic for every $k \leq n$. Now at step $n > 0$, for each pair $(i,k)$ where $i,k < n$, do the following. Let $S_{i,k}$ be the $i$th $\Sigma^0_{k+1}$ subset of $2^{< \omega}$. If we can find a finite extension of our approximation of $B$ so that the resulting approximation of $C_k$ extends an element of $S_{i,k}$, then extend our approximation of $B$ in this way. If this is not possible, then since $C_{k,n-1}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, there must be some finite subset of our current approximation to $B$ which cannot be extended to extend an element of $S_{i,k}$. Next, we finish step $n$ by defining $B_n$. If $n \notin A$ pick $B_n$ to be an element of $2^{\omega}$ extending the finite approximation of $B_n$ that we currently have, which is arithmetically generic relative to $B_0 \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{n-1}$. This clearly ensures that $C_{k,n}$ will be $(k+1)$-generic for each $k < n$, since $C_{k,n-1}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, and $B_n$ is $(k+1)$-generic relative to it. Similarly, $C_{n,n}$ is clearly $(n+1)$-generic. Otherwise, if $n \in A$, let $B_n$ be an arbitrary $(n+1)$-generic computable from $0^{(n+1)}$ and extending the finitely many bits of $B_n$ we have already determined. Now for any $k < n$, let $j_0, \ldots, j_t$ be the elements of $A$ that are $\geq k$ and $< n$. Then since $B_n$ is $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$ which can compute $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t}$ we have that $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t} \oplus B_n$ is $(k+1)$-generic. Hence $C_{k,n}$ is $(k+1)$-generic, since the remaining elements in the finite join defining $C_{k,n}$ are mutually arithmetically generic (and are hence $(k+1)$-generic relative to $B_{j_0} \oplus \ldots \oplus B_{j_t} \oplus B_n$). Similarly, $C_{n,n}$ is again clearly $n+1$-generic. To verify that our construction works, note that condition (1) is satisfied by how we pick $B_n$ in the last paragraph. Condition (2) is satisfied by the paragraph before that. 

Graph combinatorics is very different under AD to what we are used to under AC. For example, under AD there is an acyclic graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no 2-coloring (indeed, no coloring with countably many colors). Hall's marriage theorem is also false, even in a very trivial case: there is a 2-regular bipartite graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no perfect matching. These theorems both follow from the assertion that every set of reals has the Baire property, and the arguments can be found in Kechris-Solecki-Todorcevic's 1999 paper: Borel Chromatic Numbers. I also have a recent paper on descriptive combinatorics that directly uses the axiom of determinacy, and not just measure or category arguments. For example, I show that under AD, for every n, there is an acyclic n-regular graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with chromatic number n+1, and an acyclic bipartite n-regular graph with no perfect matching. The games I use are based on partitions of free products of countable groups into two pieces. 

Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group equipped with uniform measure. For any $\pi\in S_n$, let $L_n=L_n(\pi)$ denote the longest increasing subsequence. A celebrated result of Baik, Deift and Johansson states that $$P\left(\frac{L_n-2\sqrt{n}}{n^{1/6}}\leq s\right)\rightarrow F_2(s),$$ where $F_2(s)$ is the Tracy-Widom distribution, describing the largest eigenvalue of a GUE matrix. The connection between longest increasing subsequence, representation theory and random matrix theory is now well established. 

Consider a Markov chain on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with transition kernel $P$ for adjacent vertices (non-diagonal). Essentially this is a $d$ dimensional random walk with the probability of a transition dependent on it's location in the grid. This comes from a random conductance model. The theorem that concerns me is a general result for Markov chains, but I leave this motivation to assist in its proof (see below). Let $P^{2k}(0,0)$ be the probability of going from the origin and back in $2k$ steps. Moreover, suppose $P$ is reversible. The theorem that concerns me is:  

Finally, it's easy enough to show right-sided monotonicity: $C(a,b) \leq C(a,b+1)$. What interests me is how $C(a,b)$ relates to $C(a+1,b)$. This would be related to question 2 as sudden switches of inequality here would likely signify a drop. 

This is not yet an answer, but in terms of $B$ (beta) functions, one has $B(a,1-a-b)+B(b,1-a-b)+B(a,b)=\displaystyle\frac{B\left(\frac{b}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right)}{B\left(\frac{1-a}{2},\frac{a+b}{2}\right)}$ (use the fact that $\Gamma(1/2)=\sqrt{\pi})$. Now, i think one can use the additive properties that beta functions enjoy such as $B(a,b)=B(a+1,b)+B(a,b+1)$. hmm.... 

Take a simple random walk $\gamma$ in the complex plane conditioned to start at point $a$ and end at point $b$. For this random walk, we can define the winding number $W_\gamma(a,b)$ around $b$ in the usual way for complex curves. If instead we have a 2D Brownian motion $Z=X+iY$, then this definition becomes more complicated. For example, if we have a Brownian motion starting at the origin, we can talk about the winding number $\theta_t$ at time $t$ around the origin by solving the stochastic differential equation $d\theta_t=\frac{X_tdY_t-Y_tdX_t}{|Z_t|^2}$ with initial condition $\theta_0=0$. The issue is that for Brownian motion, we cannot condition on the path $Z$ to hit a particular point, because this has probability zero. Moreover, by considering annuli around $b$ and the fact that planar Brownian motion moves between concentric annuli with positive probability, it seems to me the situation becomes rather singular. 

I remember reading in Havil's book Gamma that supposidly Hardy was willing to offer his Savilian Chair at Oxford University to anyone who could prove that the Euler Mascheroni constant is irrational. I wonder if this offer still stands? 

Let $T_{\lambda}$ be the set of standard young tableaux (SYT) of shape $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\cdots\geq \lambda_n$. Now consider pushing a row $\mu$ with $\mu\geq \lambda_1$ onto $Y$ to give shape $\mu\geq \lambda_1\geq\cdots \lambda_n$. Call the resulting set of SYT $T_{\mu\cup \lambda}$. I'm curious whether there's any natural correspondence between $T_{\lambda}$ and $T_{\mu\cup\lambda}$. Specifically, if we count the cardinalities $|T_\lambda|=f_{\lambda}$ and $|T_{\mu\cup \lambda}|=f_\lambda$ via the hook-length formula, then there's an easy relation of the form: $$f_{\mu\cup \lambda}=f_{\lambda}\frac{(|\lambda|+\mu)!}{|\lambda|!}\frac{1}{\prod_{j=1}^\mu h(1,j)},$$ where $h(1,j)$ are the hooks of the first row of shape $\mu\cup\lambda$. 

As far as actual jump inversion goes, any degree $X \geq 0^{(n)}$ is the $n$th jump of some other degree. An easy way to see this is to apply Friedberg jump inversion relative to $0^{(n-1)}$, then relative to $0^{(n-2)}$, and so on down to $0$. The theorem is also true through transfinite iterates of the jump: if $X \geq 0^{(\alpha)}$, then $X$ is the $\alpha$th jump of some degree. The general version of this theorem for any $\alpha$-REA operator is due to Jockusch and Shore (1984). 

There are $B$ with this property. Lets first recall some definitions and notation. Suppose $X \in 2^\omega$ (which we identify with subsets of $\N$ via characteristic functions). Then $X'$ is the Turing jump of $X$, and $X^{(n)}$ is the nth iterate of the Turing jump of $X$. $X$ is said to be $n$-generic (i.e. $\Sigma^0_n$-generic for Cohen forcing) if for every $\Sigma^0_n$ subset $S$ of $2^{< \omega}$ there is a finite initial segment $\sigma$ of $X$ so that either $\sigma \in S$, or there are no extensions of $\sigma$ contained in $S$. $X$ is said to be arithmetically generic if $X$ is $n$-generic for every $n$. It is a standard fact that if $X$ is $1$-generic, then $X' \equiv_T 0' \oplus X$, where $\oplus$ is recursive join. We also have that if $X$ is $n$-generic and $Y$ is $1$-generic relative to $X \oplus 0^{(n-1)}$, then $X \oplus Y$ is $n$-generic. Finally, if $X_0, X_1, \ldots \in 2^\omega$, then $\bigoplus_n X_n = \{\langle n, m \rangle: m \in X_n\}$ notes their recursive join. Let $A = 0^{(\omega)} = \bigoplus_{n} 0^{(n)}$; the set of true sentences in first order arithmetic. Below, we will construct a $B$ so that: 

A $B$ with the above two properties gives a positive answer to your question by the following reasoning. We can prove by induction that for any $n$, $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. This is trivial when $n = 0$. Now for the inductive case, assume $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. Then we see that $B^{(n+1)} \equiv_T (0^{(n)} \oplus C_n)' \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n$ since $C_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and hence $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$. Finally, $0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_{n+1}$ because either $n \notin A$ and so $C_n = C_{n+1}$ or $n \in A$ so $C_{n+1} \equiv_T B_n \oplus C_n$, but then $B_n \leq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. Hence, $B^{(n)}$ cannot compute $A$ for any $n \in \omega$, since $C_{n}$ is $(n+1)$-generic, and so $0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n} \ngeq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. (Indeed, it's easy to see that $B$ is $GL_n$ for every $n \in \N$). Thus, $A$ is not arithmetically definable relative to $B$. 

If $n \notin A$, then $B_n$ is arithmetically generic, and if $n \in A$, then $B_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and computable from $0^{(n+1)}$. Hence $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{$B_n$ is arithmetic}\}$ is equal to $A$. For each $k \in \N$, let $m_i$ be the $i$th element of the set $\{m \in \N : m \notin A \lor m \geq k\}$. Then $C_k = \bigoplus_{i \in \omega} B_{m_i}$ is $(k+1)$-generic.
