Full disclosure: Being in Florida, I don't spend as much time watching winter weather, and don't have great experience correlating radar precipitation totals to actual snowfall. Is it spring yet? But I do at least some background and information, and so hopefully can add some insight. Using radar is certain to have imperfections... Smaller Radar Caveats: 

(Weatherstem.com upper air observations lesson) Both networks are aided some by satellite and ship/plane observations, but overall, despite fairly limited observations, the circulations are quite evident because of their size and impacts. So we have a pretty good handle on what's going on. Hopefully someone else is able to better address your central question about why it is vital to life on Earth! 

A big key is that in general winds are typically stronger aloft. This is because friction dissipates wind at the surface. And winds, particularly in the mid-latitudes, are reasonably strong aloft in most places. It does vary some from place to place and from time to time, but this is the general trend. Given that, a central contribution is mixing. During the day, the ground often begins to warm, and pockets of air start to rise and mix up the atmosphere. This causes the winds to increase at near-ground level because it mixes those higher winds down. But at night, as the atmosphere cools, the lowest levels start to cool first, and so the ground layer "decouples" from the rest of the atmosphere, such that it stops mixing with the air aloft. Winds typically drop off. This is important in how the atmosphere can cool quickly under clear conditions (where the warmth radiates away quickly, and the unmixed layer deepens)... and in why tornadoes are much more unlikely at night. Since we're drawing, I attempted to sketch an idea of how vertical winds change as the day goes on, and then progresses on into the night: 

I would venture that less than 5% of the ocean floor or deeper ocean depths is perhaps where less than 5% has been explored. We've really been over the vast majority of the ocean surface at some point (and have tools like satellites that give us significant data on the rest). Here's the current location of floating buoys: 

Instability... the predisposition of rising air to continue rising. Basically warm (and moist) surface air and anomalously cold air aloft. Moisture... high dewpoints create clouds more readily, form them at lower heights (important for tornadoes), and produce more precipitation/energy for storms. Plus it helps the instability. Trigger... something to get the air moving to rise so that the ingredients can be realized. There are a WIDE range of possibilities here. Important ones for storms include fronts, the dryline, vorticity advection aloft (incoming vort maxes you see spinning around on water vapor imagery), favorable jet streak quadrants, strong temperature advection (e.g. low-level jets), outflow boundaries, seabreezes/lakebreezes/riverbreezes, gravity waves, diffluence aloft, terrain/orographic lift, horizontal convection rolls/cloud streets, isentropic upglide, and differential heating boundaries. Suffice to say there are a lot of options in play, though some are more common than others. But you'd be surprised how quickly you can get used to finding them with practice. (And it's really a pity there isn't greater information/graphics/videos/explanations on some of those topics... perhaps some of these will eventually work their way here to be questions that can encourage a better, clearer reference to form) 

And there have been a few bouts of severe weather on April 8th, including small bursts in 2013 and 2015, plus the 1998 Alabama F5. Radiation in all of those regions will be quite heavily affected by the 2024 eclipse (coverage > 80% anywhere between Alabama and Nebraska). Would the decrease in energy disrupt severe weather potential later in the day? An interesting question we'll have to see on! Overall there weren't large impacts during the 2017 eclipse. As mentioned, temperatures dropped for a little while, and a few clouds dissipated. But could the regional disruption of the eclipse introduce subtle wind shifts or temperature changes that alter the longterm pattern, more significantly impacting model forecasts later in time during periods of greater weather variability? An interesting question that would be great to see studied in more detail. 

Aha, it's all about what search terms you use. I stumbled across a series of papers that gives a great range of calculations from J. Brotzge and Erickson. The key one for this topic appears to be Brotzge, Erickson, and Brooks: A 5-yr Climatology of Tornado False Alarms. The key figure is: 

When you look on meteorological maps the "surface pressure" is actually the reduced MSLP (mean sea-level pressure) value. See this NWS page for more info. So whatever height the sensor is at above the ground, they regardless compare that height back versus the sea-level to report the pressure. I always figured barometers were sited along with the main instrument set. Those indeed will all generally be raised up off the ground certain heights (aside from any soil temperature thermometers) to prevent issues with any standing water or snow cover. See for example the instrument list and extensive pictures for Oklahoma Mesonet site locations (slightly different setup, but the 2 meter temperature and 10 meter wind are widespread standards). But I was surprised to read in the ASOS User's Guide that: 

Of course an important note is that not all lows have fronts, not nearly. Only "extratropical" (baroclinic, cold-core) lows have fronts. Tropical (barotropic, warm-core) lows are symmetrical, and don't generate their energy from horizontal temperature imbalances, but instead when overall warming temperature, typically in the mid-levels, decreases the amount of air in the entire tropospheric column... 

With all the questions we've had through the years that have tied into weather models, plus all the sites around the web providing weather model data, it got me wondering: is there any table that summarizes the basic details of the major weather models? Details like calculation methods, spatial resolution, calculation timestep, vertical grid type, regions covered, parameterizations, run hours (and when the output is typically available), operating organizations, perhaps even some basic skill scores. It would seem such a link would be useful in answering many questions, and be of use to many in trying to better understand how the models work or perform. I'd think the obvious spot would be Wikipedia, as they seem to have similar collaborative lists for all sorts of useful things, but all I found was the very limited list on the models page. Likewise searched AMS Journals for NWP summary and similar terms to no avail. Does such a resource exist!?! 

But, the result is, scientifically, when precipitation falls, it is fundamentally a cooling process. The stronger the precipitation is, the much more significant the cooling. And certain atmospheric setups enhance the cooling effect even more (steep lapse rates, dry air nearer the ground) Now, even after saying all that, it actually can still be warmer soon after rainfall. How in the world is that possible!?! Because wind can still blow in large amounts of air from other areas... sometimes from environments that haven't yet themselves experienced significant precipitation. This often happens as warm fronts pass. [++ Heaviest rainfalls do more often come with cold fronts, which bring in more cold air. However most (nontropical) lows start with a balance of areas of advancing warm air followed by surging cold air. So you may well see both... or you may not: in more mature storm systems - as you'll often see in winter - most warm air is completely undercut by cold air... and so many large areas never experience any notable warmup as a storm system works through ++] Other unbalanced factors can overwhelm the cooling effect as well... like when it's cloud all day, then rains a bit, but finally the sun comes out. The hot sun can quickly turn the battle back towards the warmer side. [++ There is indeed at least one other very very rare way, where if the atmosphere is setup perfectly, a strong downdraft can actually begin to warm due to adiabatic compression, but still have enough oomph to reach the ground... and you wind up with a heat burst. ++] 

It's hard to visualize exactly what you saw, but typically in convective clouds, there is such significant motion that oftentimes very chaotic and varying cloud shapes will develop as a result, and they may move quite quickly due to the strong winds. It appears the term pannus may be used for these, though I'm more familiar with calling them scud. You mentioned rain, it's northern hemisphere summer, so these cumulus-convection byproducts sounds quite likely. Around other storm chasers/meteorologists, I've also heard these types of clouds called debris clouds... which is a rather apropos description given that such clouds are often leftovers from earlier storm evolution (perhaps even remnants of old wall clouds if in a situation with supercells)... but using that term might bring confusion to others because tornado debris can also be called a debris cloud. This page appears to exemplify the confusion, as the picture appears to include remnant clouds from earlier storms in the foreground while the description gives the tornadic definition. So we probably should avoid this term. There's no bad gas in thunderstorms... what you see in meteorological clouds is liquid or ice water (all clouds form around tiny bits of dust and such, but this wouldn't affect appearance). Occasionally smoke or such may be ingested in a cloud, but even in situations where large fires and volcanic eruptions produce clouds, the forced moist updraft region will often look quite similar to a typical cumulus cloud. 

Precipitable water is the total amount of moisture throughout the air (the total in the entire tropospheric air "column"; most moisture is found in the lowest few km, due to decreases in temperature and density and where humidity sources being at the ground). Whereas QPF is the amount of precipitation that has fallen or is predicted to fall in a certain period of time (often 6 or 24 hours). Generally more moisture (higher PWATs) do indicate the potential for more precipitation. But you could definitely have a large PWAT and get no rain/snow/etc to fall from the sky. I believe the greatest PWAT values are typically found in the warm saturated columns near tropical cyclones (hurricanes/typhoons). From experience, in the US South, PWATs near/above 2 inches are generally considered quite large in the summer, and tend to indicate a greater chance of rain from air mass/sea breeze/frontal storms. Whereas hourly rainfall rates can often be nearer 3-5 inches per hour, and locations can report over 20 inches of rain in a day [rainfall records]. 

At the time of this post, there was urgent danger of spillway failure at the Oroville Dam in California, with evacuations in place for hundreds of thousands, and even larger populations further downstream in the Sacramento metro area. There's 300 large dams in the world. So it would seem quite useful to have a method to quickly estimate how quickly a large flood might move downstream. 

seems to offer a fair reflection of the overall situation as of now in tropical cyclones and possible connections to climate change. There's certainly plenty of debate over how significantly climate change is influencing the shifts seen; some will draw more conclusions than others. Regardless of whether it's due to changes in identification practices or other causes like human climate change, it's clear there are more named systems in the early season, and that would certainly often result in an earlier first name. On the other hand, is it due particularly to sufficient ocean temperatures existing earlier in the season over wider areas? It would seem odd that such a change would mostly impact only the number of tropical storms, and not change the number of hurricanes. But further analysis should certainly be done and the other MPI factors. I do offer one final small postulate, based both upon these graphs and upon my own perceptions... perhaps at least a small part of the upswing in tropical storms might be due to an increase in the buzz at the start of each new year. It seems there is more and more talk and "excitement" and interviews as each year get started. And I wonder if that may prime forecasters to make earlier designations sometimes. 

Today's dew points, courtesy of Pivotal Weather Indeed, you can see it is fairly dry over parts of central and western China compared to many other places, such as eastern China and back nearer Europe... due in part to the affects of the mountains and distance from large bodies of water... though you may also notice other spots to the west do show comparable moisture for this date despite producing lower temperatures. Ground cover differences are part of the reason (more plants = more area the solar energy is distributed into, plus typically store moisture, equating to slower temperature changes). And then wind direction gives one final explanation why it's not as warm further to the west:
