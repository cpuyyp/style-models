The result follows from Euler's Theorem on homogenous equations. This theorem states that if a function $f(x,y)$ is homogeneous of degree $\lambda$ then the following holds: $\lambda f(x,y)= x \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + y \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ A (production) function with constant returns to scale is homogeneous of degree 1 by definition. The definition of constant returns to scale is basically the same as the definition of homogeneity of degree 1. That means $\lambda=1$, which proves the result you need. 

You are not likely to find New Keynesian DSGE models where money or currency plays an explicit role. These models mostly abstract from these considerations altogether and monetary policy is simply represented by the interest rate. I understand your situation as I myself have tried to write papers and searched for literature where dollarization plays a role. If you can, try to circumvent the explicit use of currency in your model. Think about what the currency's role is in your model, e.g. if it is to have different inerest rates in different countries or in different currencies, then simply use different interest rates instead of different currencies. Another way would be to go outside of the standard DSGE framework and use other international finance, open economy models, as you would find in the Obstfeld/Rogoff book. If you really want to stick with DSGE, I would recommend looking into open economy DSGE models as well as DSGE models with "Money in the Utility Function". 

All (marshallian) demand functions are homogenous of degree zero in prices and income. This is a well known result. That means that $x(\lambda p, \lambda I) = x(p,I)$, where $p$ is a vector of prices (i.e. x could be a function of any number of prices, including $P_x$ and $P_y$, which were given in your example). So if we multiply all prices and income by the same amount, demand doesn't change. This is very intuitive. Imagine the government would just add a zero to all prices and to your paycheck. There is no reason for you to change your demand as nothing really got cheaper nor did your income increase in real terms. To see this formally: Proof: $x(p,I) = argmax \; U(x)$ s.t. $px \leq I$. $x( \lambda p, \lambda I) = argmax \; U(x)$ s.t. $ \lambda px \leq \lambda I \Leftrightarrow $ $x( \lambda p, \lambda I) = argmax \; U(x)$ s.t. $px \leq I = x(p,I)$ $Which \; is \; the \; definition \; of \; homogeneity \; of \; degree \; zero. QED. $ The last step follows because we cancel $\lambda$ in the budget constraint on both sides. 

Using your calculation the value of both of those machines would be the same about 306 roubles, but machine 1 produces the goods in year 1. So in year 2 you can put those roubles in the bank and earn 20 percent interest on them. So at the end of 2 years you actually have 528 roubles instead of 440. What the NPV calculator is doing is taking into account the production in year 1 is worth more than the production in year 2 by dividing it by a smaller number, $(1+0.2)$ instead of $(1+0.2)^2$. Regarding the part about $i$ meaning different things. $i$ is how we tell how muc we value a dollar today relative to tomorrow. In the real world inflation makes things in the future cost more so we discount future dollars by that amount. In your problem a dollar I save today is worth 1.20 tomorrow so if I invest that money in a machine I better earn at least that much otherwise I'd rather put it in the bank. Explanation of NPV: Think of there being 2 different machines. One gets you 240 in one year. The second gives you nothing in the first year but 200 in the second. Using your calculations you would say you'd pay $$ \frac{240}{(1+0.2)} = 200 $$ for machine 1 and $$ \frac{200}{(1+0.2)^2} \sim 138.9 $$ for machine 2. Thus you better be willing to pay 338.9 for a machine that does the work of machine 1 and machine 2. That is all NPV is doing here. 

For risk averse consumers with thrice differentiable utility $u^{\prime\prime\prime}>0$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for consumers to save more for tomorrow when they are really unsure what is going to happen in the future. 

I think the author is just taking logs of the original equation. The natural log approximates percent changes for small changes. More info here. Using that and properties of the log, $\ln(ab)=\ln(a)+\ln(b)$, you get that formula. 

The agent doesn't always prefer consumption profiles that are more smooth. It depends on the curvature of $u$ and the maginitude of $\beta$. Consider the following example. Let $u(c) = c^{1/2}$. Then $v(c_1,c_2) = c_1^{1/2} + \beta c_2^{1/2}$ satisfies $v^\prime(c)>0$ and $v^{\prime\prime}(c)<0$ for all $c_1,c_2>0$. Note: I'm assuming by $v^{\prime\prime}(c)<0$ you mean that $v$ is concave. It is a little unclear what v^{\prime\prime}(c) is because $c$ is a vector. Consider the bundles $a=(1,0)$ and $b=(.5,.5)$. $b$ is smoother than $a$, but the agent only prefers $b$ to $a$ if $$1^{1/2} + \beta 0^{1/2} < .5^{1/2} + \beta .5^{1/2}$$ This occurs only if $\beta > .414$. Since the assumption was only that $0<\beta<1$ then the agent doesn't always prefer more smooth profiles to less. The intuition here is that the agent needs to care about the future enough. 

Your question is essentially about precautionary savings, i.e. the response of savings to risk. What determines precautionary savings is the coefficient of relative prudence: $CRP=-\frac{U'''}{U''}C$, where $U$ is the utility function, $C$ is consumption and primes denote derivatives. As we always have decreasing marginal utility in economics, i.e. $U''<0$, then the sign of the savings will depend on the sign of the third derivative, as you mentioned. Think of this coefficient as similar to the risk aversion coefficients. The difference is that prudence means that agents act in anticipation of risk by saving more, whereas risk aversion reflects how agents react when presently faced with risk. With quadratic utility, the coefficient of relative prudence is zero and there are no precautionary savings. Hence there is no effect of risk on savings. With such utility we therefore have certainty equivalence, which is quite convenient and hence often used. Mean preserving spreads don't matter then. So no, it is not the same as in the positive case, where savings would go up in resonse to risk. What is crucial here, as you noted, is the third derivative. The coefficient really only uses the second derivative as a normalization. A mean-preserving spread keeps the mean/expected value of consumption the same. However, it does not neccssarily keep the derivatives (marginal utility) the same, which are what matter for (savings) decisions. If the marginal utility is linear (quadratic utility), then a mean-preserving spread keeps the expected marginal utilities the same as well. Hence, there are no precautionary savings (no reaction) in that case. If the marginal utilities are convex, then the mean-preserving spread changes things in a way that matters, i.e. it becomes beneficial to save more. This follows from Jensen's inequality. If it is concave, the opposite is true. So the relevant function to look at is $U'$, as this is how the agent makes decisions. When we want to see whether a function is convex or concave we look at the second derivative. So the second derivative of $U'$ is $U'''$, which is why the third derivative matters here. 

We value stock if no dividends are paid, exactly for the reason you mention, we can sell them at a higher value later on. The value added to the stock if we invest the profits (would be dividends) into the company should be around the same value the dividends would pay off. However instead of paying taxes each time we get a dividend we can pay them just once when the stock is sold potentially saving on taxes. P.s. Blanchard is a great book and how I first started learning macro :).
