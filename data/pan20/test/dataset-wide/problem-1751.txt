Makes perfect sense. Well, far as I can see it should work: I use similar directives all the time. I'd check all the directory permissions and ownership, and the file permissions, and if those are all right, I'd check for a rogue .htaccess file or some other piece of lock-downery that may be tripping you up. If Apache's document root is /var/www/html, then you shouldn't have any trouble pointing at something in /var/www/html/includes/ unless there is some specific directive (or permission issue) blocking it. 

Tomcat listens on 8080 by default, because it's assumed that apache will be running as well, and that'd cause all kinds of conflicts. Here is a short tutorial on how to get it to run on 80. 

You're doing two different methods of resizing the drive. If your drive was just a filesystem sitting on a partition, you could extend the drive, delete the partition, recreate the larger partition, and then just extend the filesystem with xfs_growfs. That's how it was done in the old days, before LVM. You're using logical volumes though, which means you have defined physical devices, volume groups, logical volumes, etc. The easiest way to extend that would have been to create a new partition, create a new physical device from that, add it to the volume group, then do the lvextend/xfs_growfs. Here is a more thorough how-to for that. You're kind of split down the middle here, but it's fixable. You need to pvresize to fix the size of the physical volume: it's not showing the full size of the 750GB you've allocated to it. That should increase the free space in your volume group, and then you can extend the volume. 

Nothing wrong with using a VM to run a mail server, though if you're using exchange, you'll need to be careful with resources. Dan's right. Most external mailservers will try to re-deliver several times before they give up. I tend to set up a mail relay upstream of my actual mailserver, so I don't have to put my actual server out there on teh interwebs. You can set up a relatively foolproof sendmail server that only does relaying for practically nothing, and it removes a lot of stress when you have users that are really attached to their email. Even if your local server goes down often, you can setup your relay to keep the incoming mail until delivered. 

When you put data in a table that is allowed to expand, it increases in size. When you DELETE data from the table, that size remains the same. There are a couple of things you can do: 1) ALTER the table, like Warner suggested, to reduce the size. 2) OPTIMIZE the table (if this is supported). That should also reduce the size. 3) Back up the table, drop the table, then re-import the data into a new table. In every case, you should back up the data first. You should run a cronjob to do optimize or alter periodically, if you remove data on a regular basis. That remains true whether you're running MySQL, MSSQL, or Oracle. They all require maintenance. @Warner: Well, mostly preference. I'll preface this by saying I don't use MySQL for anything where performance is a factor, and if I did, I'd optimize, then alter the table to make it larger so there isn't an expansion penalty. For my needs it's 100% about automation and ease of maintenance. Running optimize keeps everything neat and tidy. 

I'm not sure what the point would be...By default, the external address would be over-ridden by the hosts file, which nearly always maps localhost to 127.0.0.1. A default BIND zone file does include a localhost zone, though. Never really thought about it. 

I wrote up a big post, and I swear I posted it, and yet...Hmmm. You're going to want to do some kind of archiving: it will make your life so much easier. I recommend 7zip; it's a free zip utility that has a powerful command line interface. Very easy to write a 1-line 7zip command to archive and compress a whole directory tree, and it also supports the "update" option for archives, so instead of wrapping up every file every time, it can just update the changed files...Should save a ton of time. Once you've got your archive, you'll want to send it somewhere. I recommend WinSCP; it's a free FTP/SFTP client that also has good command line/scripting support. The scripting interface there is quite powerful. Put those two together, and you can write a simple DOS batch file to run the necessary commands. Quick, simple, and effective. Try to avoid the temptation to reinvent the wheel. That's a great lesson to learn. There are people out there who have already spent a great deal of time putting together pieces that you can use. 

Exhausting the heat to the attic shouldn't prove a problem, assuming you're going to put a fan in the box to drive the hot air. The heat in the attic won't matter: attics have external vents because of the extra heat, and a little more won't even be noticed. Might even cool it off a bit. I wouldn't get an interior air conditioner for several reasons: 

It won't automatically know which one to use, no. But you can specify this using the route command. You can try to configure the AD services to only use the IP of your "internal" NIC, but it's better if you just set your upstream firewall to block all inbound/outbound domain traffic. I don't really trust the AD not to try and make friends on the outside. 

You can use LDAP or Radius to authenticate 1 or 100 machines, and it'll make administration a hell of a lot easier. Link to ProFTPD's MOD_LDAP module Link to ProFTPD's MOD_RADIUS module 

After about 10 days the issue just went away. Seems like something weird was propagating through the AD. I bounced it off the corporate exchange people, and they had nothing. I ran through the whole configuration and it was all normal. Unfortunately I have no idea what eventually fixed it: it was certainly dependent on some screwy behaviour attached to the admin who left, but his credentials weren't directly attached to the exchange server or IIS, and I fixed so many peripheral issues in that time period that it could have been any number of things. Highly unsatisfying non-solution. If has any AD experience that would explain a server that forced repeated re-authentication, I'd be interested in hearing about it, and I'll switch the accepted solution to anything convincing.
