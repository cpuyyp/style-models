That is it. Of course you can make it better by putting up the system for each level of government (nation, state, district, city, whatever), and strongly decentralising the decisions. It will avoid a too much effect of "dictatorship of the 51%". By teaching that politeness implies "do not vote on subject that do not directly concern you", you can even crush the effect a bit more. 

For Average Joe, it is probable that "liquid" means "I can swim in it". That means that you can actually push the liquid away to make yourself move, by conservation of momentum. So your liquid needs to have a mass. That yields several problems : 

If it make sense, from the point of view of evolution, that we have to reproduce and to die, it is because we are not able to mutate during our life, we have to create a new beings to allow mutation (and sexual reproduction to allow for mixing genes). So an answer is : just forget about reproducing, and dying. You can imagine a species which simply clone itself (for example by lying eggs, from which a perfect copy of yourself emerge after a while). Then if a creature is subject to enough random mutations during its life (e.g. due to intracellular processes or more natural radiation that what we get on earth), its clones can evolved in a different way than the original, and you can reduce the need for genetic exchange. You can go a step further, by assuming that each member of this specie produce a kind of virus in its saliva (or anywhere else) that is able to inject part of its DNA into cells of other members of the specie, and the result is : when two kiss they actually mix their genes, without need of reproduction. Note that in this scenario searching for the best partner still make some sort sense, since you will directly "inherit" part of its genetic features. Note also that such a process can be extend between members of different species. Of course there is problems, for example if only some part of you partner is affected, he will grow strange unequally distributed mutations. You can avoid that by "sharing" your genes with your partner's clones in a early stage of development (e.g larva or egg) that you can easily affect as a whole. 

Generally both at the same time. 1. Magic is not learnt Sorcerers just happen to know how to use some magic, or even to just use some when needed. For example, for what I know, the character of Merlin the wizard never followed an education in magic. He just has the powers (because he is the son of some kind of devil) and that is it. For your scenario it is not really helpful, but if by studying magic you mean mastering the powers you are born with (a bit like the X-men). 2. To perform magic you borrow power from a superior being That is a recurring pattern in medieval literature. You either get your powers by passing a contract with the Devil, or by receiving the blessing of God (the latter is basically what a miracle is). Therefore to use magic you are dependant on the good will of some superior entity (which is beyond your understanding). You can not directly study magic, but you can study how to please different entities, or how to ask them a favour the right way. 

You have a magic guild, this mean that there is some list of (more or less) every magicians. If you can retrieve that list, you can then check the identity of everyone and forbid magicians to enter standard polling places, and force them to go in separated polling places. If magicians are a small minority, you can even ask them to auto-regulate their polling places, since whatever they do in the process will have little effects. The idea is that during the whole process you keep every magicians far from the urns, so that they do not get the chance to modify their content. The other strategies (i.e. changing someone's mind directly) seems really hard to counter. However, unless the magicians are really powerful or numerous, they might not have the ability to act on a sufficient amount of people to change the result of an election. 

It does not have to be the probe primary purpose. The probe could be a spy probe aiming at gathering data around the universe in order to, say, plan an invasion. However, each civilisation the probe encounter is already extinct and the civilisation which launched the spy probe just forget about it after some decades because it is so depressing. Alternatively, the launcher civilisation could simply get extinct in the meantime. 

To transport someone from one world (which I'm assuming means "planet" since you asked for non-magical means) to another, there are basically two options: spaceships and portals/teleportation. So I guess it depends on the technology level of your modern world. If it is high enough that spaceships are common enough for them to be a viable means of transport (as in <hopefully> our world in 10-20 years), then that is likely the best method. If spaceships don't exist, are only uncrewed, are used solely by government entities, etc. (similar to our present-day world), you'll probably have to go with portals or teleportation of some sort. There are two types of portals: scientific ones (wormholes) and magical ones. Unfortunately, wormholes require an even higher technology level than spaceships, and are therefore probably infeasible. Magical portals have practically zero constraints, because they're magic. The same goes for teleportation: scientifically sound teleportation is (as far as we know) impossible, but you can do almost whatever you want with magical teleportation. There are other options that could work non-magically, depending on your setting. For example, if your worlds are orbiting each other very closely (i.e. closer than Earth's geostationary orbit) and are tidally locked to each other, a space elevator could suffice, and would likely be possible with present-day technology. That's about it, unfortunately. There are plenty of overtly magical options, but not much that could work without magic. 

Note: What is written below this may or may not be valid anymore. See the comments. According to Wikipedia, the gravitational binding energy of the sun is $6.87\times10^{41}$ Joules, which means that anything impacting the sun would need to possess at least this much kinetic energy in order to cause the sun to explode successfully. Applying the equation$$E_k = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v}{c})^2}}-mc^2$$from here gives that, assuming that the object is traveling at exactly $99.9999\%$ of light speed, its mass would have to be over $1.08\times10^{22}$ kg to succeed. This is approximately the mass of Pluto. I would imagine you were intending a somewhat smaller object, although this mass might suffice if you're using a neutronium projectile. Increasing the velocity decreases the required mass, although the velocities involved end up being extremely high. For an object weighing (for example) $5$ metric tons, such as a very large space probe, its velocity would have to be $$99.99999999999999999999999999999999999999998\%$$ of the speed of light to blow up the sun. This is possibly impractically high, and the energies of the individual particles approach and in some cases exceed the Planck energy, beyond which physics as we know it breaks down. Eventually, the body would likely form a black hole upon collision with the Sun or even earlier, placing an ultimate lower limit on the size of the impactor that is beyond my knowledge of physics to calculate. In conclusion, your foreign body will either have to be unimaginably large or unimaginably fast to successfully blow up the sun. 

If the TPA is so vehemently opposed to time travel that they aren't willing to even do it themselves to keep others from doing it, I believe it's impossible without some way of intercepting time travelers in $t$ before they go back in time. If they can look forward in $t$, and depending on the details of your scenario, this may be possible. However, if they are willing to go back in time themselves ("for the greater good"), and there is no such thing as the butterfly effect, and time criminals are altering time in order to change historic events, there's a simple solution: the TPA can place a secret base of operations in prehistoric times. This way, they can periodically send agents (or look forward in $t$, again, if that is possible) to check the historical timeline for meddling, similar to @DJClayworth's answer. However, now when time is meddled with, the TPA don't have to worry about their base being erased from existence, because the base's $t$ is before the alteration's $t$, and they can merely intercept the offending time traveler when in $t$ they arrive and detain them (probably permanently, so that no one can reveal their secret). There's plenty of opportunity for interesting plot complications with this: 

The air's gravitational and inertial masses are different. You could have something similar to this, except the concept is more flexible for reasons I will explain more shortly (and of course it doesn't need to be frictionless since air resistance is an integral concern in your world). First of all, since gravity is already different in your universe (where there's a downward gravitational pull without any mass-energy generating it), there's no need to keep gravitational and inertial masses identical. For anything. This could open up far-reaching consequences for all sorts of things, not necessarily just why the air and the falling objects are moving at different rates. At a bare minimum, the air alone could have zero total gravitational mass, and everything else could have its normal gravitational mass. Alternatively, all sorts of different elements/materials/forms of energy, including but not limited to air, could have varying or even negative gravitational mass, allowing all kinds of interesting effects Ã  la The Edge Chronicles. Secondly, if one decides not to throw out every single principle of general relativity, gravity and acceleration can still be equivalent. In this case, it doesn't even matter that the air's gravitational mass is exactly zero, simply that it differs from its inertial mass (or even that the ratio between the gravitational and inertial masses of air differs from the same ratio for the falling objects). This way, the air and everything else will fall at different accelerations, and if you observe from a reference frame in which the air is stationary, the air will be stationary, with everything else falling through it at a rate that may be adjusted by adjusting the strength of gravity. It can even be falling "upward", and no one would be able to tell the difference. (Just swap "up" and "down" and it's the exact same universe.) Another option is that the air is the only thing that has nonzero gravitational mass, and it is actually what's falling upward. All of these are (basically) entirely equivalent descriptions of the same reality â that is, one in which air falls at a different acceleration from everything else. Decoupling inertial and gravitational mass could also partially solve the issue you identified in your previous question. The cities need not fall at 1 g; they could be made of a material with a much lower gravitational than inertial mass (measuring, of course, from a reference frame stationary with respect to the air, as might be standard in-universe), and hence fall slower and probably more stably. In order to experience gravity ordinarily, the same cannot apply to humans, but the terminal velocity for a city (to the best of my limited knowledge) is going to be higher than, say, a human-sized chunk of city material, simply due to higher volume-to-surface-area ratio. It could be that the terminal velocities of humans and cities are in the same general range, allowing humans to skydive between cities after all. In all, substances with differing gravitational and inertial masses might be able to solve this problem, and possibly more.
