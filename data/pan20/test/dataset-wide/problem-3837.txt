I have been looking for a couple of days for the answer to this question to no avail. Let me define what $\Sigma$-injective is. 

These "obvious morphism" come from the following setup: By 2 we may replace $R^\bullet$ with a bounded complex $I^\bullet$ such that each $I^i$ is injective as left and right $A$-module (but not necessarily as bimodule). Thus for every complex of left $A$-modules $M^\bullet$ there is a map, defined at the level of chain complexes \begin{align*} M^\bullet \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_A(M^\bullet, I^\bullet), I^\bullet) \end{align*} given by simple evaluation. Passing to the derived category, the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), R^\bullet)$. Putting $M^\bullet = A$ gives us the morphism of point 3 of the above definition (if $M^\bullet$ is a complex of bimodules then the map respects this structure), and in the paper Yekutieli proves that this map is an isomorphism for $A$ if and only if it is an isomorphism whenever $M^\bullet$ is a bounded complex with finitely generated cohomology modules. So far, so good. Dualizing complexes, when they exists, are not unique. In order to fix a special class of isomorphisms Yekutieli introduces local cohomology. Set $\Gamma_m(-) = \varinjlim Hom_A(A/A_{\geq n},-)$, where $A_{\geq n}$ denotes the ideal of elements of $A$ of degree at least $n$. This is a left exact functor, with a right derived functor $\mathcal R \Gamma_m$ defined over left bounded complexes of left $A$-modules. Then he states that there is a map similar to that above, \begin{align*} \mathcal R \Gamma_m(M^\bullet) \to \mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet)) \end{align*} It is this map I am trying to make sense of. By looking at it simply at the level of complexes, we might feel tempted to replace $M^\bullet$ by an injective resolution $J^\bullet$, reuse our old resolution of $R^\bullet$ called $I^\bullet$, and thus obtain a map \begin{align*} \Gamma_m(J^\bullet) \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_{A}(J^\bullet, I^\bullet), \mathcal \Gamma_m(I^\bullet)) \end{align*} given again by evaluation. This is indeed well-defined, but the problem is that passing to the derived category, it is not immediate, at least to me, that the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet))$. In order for that to happen, $\Gamma_m(I^\bullet)$ should consist of $A$-module which are injective as right $A$-modules, and I see no reason for that to be true (in the article it is proven that these modules are injective as left $A$-modules). Any ideas on how to fix this? Have I made a mistake with the definition of this last morphism? 

I believe the number of proper definitions of the term "quantum group" is some element of $\mathbb R \setminus \{1\}$. Even the simplest example, the quantized enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb C)$, has at least two definitions (more if you count the coproduct as part of the definition). If you are careful with the details, as for example in Jantzen's book "Introduction to Quantum Groups", you either get bogged down in the details of left-right compatibilites and twisted coproducts or, more in the spirit of the subject, you change the definition midway. 

There is the conjecture that Selberg Class L-functions satisfy RH. So that an L-function needs to have its coefficient multiplicatives (plus other conditions: functional equation,...) in order to satisfy RH. But I would like to know if for a L-function of Selberg class it is possible to find another L-function having the same non trivial zeros (strictly in the critical strip) but having "the sum of its coefficient" bounded instead of "multiplicative coefficients". Meaning that for a L-function of Selberg class $L(s)= \sum a_n n^s$ with multiplicative coefficient $a_n$ there is another L-function $L_1$ (of Selberg class or not) having same non trivial zeros as $L(s)$ such that $L_1(s)= \sum b_n n^s$ with $\exists K, \forall N, |\sum_{n=1}^{n=N} b_n| \le K$ For primitive Dirichlet L-functions the function is itself satisfying the condition. But for the Zeta function we need to multiply it by $(1-2^{1-s})$ in order to obtain the Dirichlet Eta function which has the same zeros (strictly in the critical strip) as Zeta with the sum of its coefficient bounded. (And no more multiplicative property for its coefficients) Any existing results on this question ? May be it is obvious that such equivalence does not always exists? 

What are the functions verifying: $$\int_0^{\infty} f(t) \cos(2\pi xt)=\lambda \frac{1}{x} f(\frac{1}{x})$$ With $\lambda$ a constant ? (Functions $x^{-\alpha}$ with $0<\alpha<1$ are solutions but can we find other solutions?) 

This function $G(x)$ is not periodic, even if the terms of the sum are the same. The fact to add a rational number $\frac{c}{d}$ changes the order of summation of the terms and finally the sum defining $G(x+\frac{c}{d})$ exists but is different from $G(x)$. Suppose $G(x)$ is $\mathbb{Q}$ periodic then as $G(x)$ is also equal to: $$ G(x)=\sum\limits_{q =1}^{\infty} \sum\limits_{m=1}^{\infty} q \; f(qm) e^{2 i \pi mqx} = \sum\limits_{n =1}^{\infty} A_n e^{2 i \pi nx} $$ (here we can change the order of summation as the sum is absolutely convergent!), with the $A_n$ such that $\sum\limits_{n =1}^{N} A_n $ converges (as $f$ has been chosen fast decreasing ). It means $\sum\limits_{n =1}^{\infty} A_n e^{2 i \pi nx} $ converges uniformly so that $G(x)$ is continuous. Therefore the function $G(x)$ should be constant and its Fourier coefficient should be zero except the constant term and this is not the case, so $G(x)$ cannot be periodic. 

Can we interchange the order of integration of following double integral ? $$I = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} F(x,y) \overline{R(x,y)} - R(x,y) \overline{F(x,y)} \; dx \; dy$$ Where $F(x,y)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ and $R(x,y)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^2 n^2 f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ With $f(x)$ a function from $\mathbb{R^+}$ to $\mathbb{C}$, exponentially decreasing at infinity, such that near zero the asymptotic is $f(x)= a.x +O(x^2)$ ($a$ is a complex constant) and $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx=0$ If we could interchange integration order we would have immediatly $I=0$: $$ I= \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) \overline{x^2 n^2 f(nx)} - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x^2 k^2 f(kx) \overline{ f(kx)} \; dx =0 $$ The integral $I$ can also be written (for $n$ and $k$ strictly positive integers) : $$I= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n \ne k} f(nx)\overline{k^2 x^2 f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} - n^2 x^2 f(nx)\overline{ f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} dx\; dy$$ $$I= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n \ne k} (n^2-k^2) x^2 f(nx)\overline{f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} dx\; dy$$ So showing we can interchange integration is equivalent to show that following integral is well defined: $$ \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} | \sum_{n \ne k} (n^2-k^2) x^2 f(nx)\overline{f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} | dx\; dy$$ But how can this be proved? I post a similar question here: Is this double integral of Fourier series always real? Note: $I$ is well-defined as $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y} $ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^2 x^2 f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ do not have any singularity for $x$ near zero (this can be shown using Poisson summation formula, even for $y=0$ there is no singularity as we have $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx=0$). 

EDIT 7/15/14 I was just looking back at this old answer, and I don't think I ever answered the stated question. I can't delete an accepted answer, but I'll point at that, as far as I can tell, the Vakil reference I give also only address the question of deforming $X$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, not of embedding it in some larger flat family over $\mathbb{Z}_p$. EDIT Oops! David Brown points out below that I misread the question. I was answering the question of finding a smooth scheme which does not deform in a smooth family over Z_p. Well, to make up for that, I'll point to some references which definitely contain answers. Look at section 2.3 of Ravi Vakil's paper on Murphy's law for deformation spaces $URL$ for some history, and several good references. Moreover, Ravi describes how to build an explicit cover of P^2 in characteristic p which does not deform to characteristic 0. Basically, the idea is to take a collection of lines in P^2 which doesn't deform to characteristic 0 and take a branched cover over those lines. For example, you could take that p^2+p+1 lines that have coefficients in F_p. 

There is no such bound. The most dramatic separation between these numbers that I can find is that, for any $n$, there is a simplicial complex with $2^{n-1}-1$ vertices, $\binom{n}{2}$ facets and Euler characteristic $1 + (-1)^{n-1} (n-1)!$. This is really a construction about lattices. See Chapter 3 of Enumerative Combinatorics Volume 1 for background. Let $L$ be a finite lattice, with minimal and maximal element $0$ and $1$. Let $A$ be the set of atoms (elements which cover $0$) and let $B$ be the set of co-atoms (elements covered by $1$.) Let the simplicial complex $\Delta(L)$ have vertex set $B$ and have as faces those subsets of $B$ whose meet is NOT $0$. If $\bigwedge X \neq 0$ for $X \subset L$ then there is some $a \in A$ with $a \leq \bigwedge X$. For this $a$, we have $x \geq a$ for all $x \in X$. Thus, the facets of $\Delta(L)$ are the sets $\{b: b \geq a,\ b \in B \}$ for each $a \in A$. Thus, the number of facets is at most $|A|$. (At most because this might be the same set for two different $a$'s. The Euler characteristic is $\sum_{k > 0} (-1)^{k-1} M_k$ where $M_k$ is the number of $k$-element subsets of $B$ whose meet is not $0$. Let $N_k$ be the number of $k$-element subsets of $k$ whose meet is $0$. Stanley (Corollary 3.9.4) shows that $\sum_{k \geq 0} (-1)^k N_k = \mu(0,1)$. Using $M_k + N_k = \binom{|B|}{k}$, and keeping track of whether or not the sum includes $k=0$, we get $$\chi(\Delta(L)) = 1+\mu(0,1).$$ So now I just need to find a lattice whose Mobius invariant is significantly more than it number of atoms/coatoms. (I can always turn the lattice upside down to switch the two.) The partition lattice (Example 3.10.4 in Stanley) has $\binom{n}{2}$ atoms, $2^{n-1}-1$ coatoms and $\mu=(-1)^{n-1} (n-1)!$, so turning this upside down this does the trick. Let $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots, n \}$. Explicitly, we have a vertex $v_{AB}$ for each nontrivial partition $[n] = A \sqcup B$, where the order of $A$ and $B$ is irrelevant and "nontrivial" means $A$, $B \neq \emptyset$. Call these vertices "splits". We have a face for every set of split $\{(A_1, B_1), (A_2, B_2), \ldots, (A_r, B_r) \}$ such that there is some $i \neq j$ such that, for every $r$, the two elements $i$ and $j$ lie in the same half of the split $(A_r, B_r)$. Another example from Stanley with superpolynomial separation is to take $L$ to be the lattice of subspaces in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. In other words, we have a vertex for each of the $q^{n-1} + q^{n-2} + \cdots +q+1$ lines through the origin, and we have a face for every set of lines which does not span the entire vector space. So the facets are hyperplanes through the origin, which there are again $q^{n-1} + q^{n-2} + \cdots +q+1$ of. According to example 3.10.2 in Stanley, $\mu = (-1)^n q^{\binom{n}{2}}$. Let $v$ be the number of vertices and $f$ the number of facets. These two examples make me wonder whether the true bound is $e^{O(\log v \cdot \log f)}$.
