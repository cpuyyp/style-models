I would strongly recommend talking to your Union Rep or an employment lawyer. If you are off sick, the company has to pay you Statutory Sick Pay. I would think that they only need to pay you for the time that you were working. I agree that it sounds harsh that they won't pay you for the time you were incapacitated - but you really need to talk to a qualified employment professional. 

To tell the person reading the CV what you did. To make it slightly easier when checking your references. 

Most reasonable people will understand that you're curious about their country. They will also understand that the news you see doesn't always reflect reality. Don't assume that you know more than they do - and respect their decision if they don't want to talk about a certain aspect of it. Finally, if you are planning on relocating to the conflict zone - I think you can disregard everything I've said! Make sure you fully understand the risks and dangers before moving. 

Yes, you should be looking for a new job if that's how they're treating you. In the meantime, there are two people you need to speak to. 

Always limit your commits and pull request to as little changes as possible. It makes code review faster, and limits the risks of conflicts. Put yourself in the code reviewer shoes and imagine receiving a 1000+ lines code review because the dev has reformatted the entire file, for a change that should have taken 20 lines. Put yourself in the shoes of the next dev who is working on a feature branch, and gets conflicts on all their modified lines, because meanwhile you changed the formatting on a part that you were not expected to touch for your feature. To that end, only fix the formatting of the lines you actually work on, if that is relevant. (Keep the indentation consistent with the surroundings). Try to avoid anything in your PR that is not directly related to your task. 

One place where I worked had a "headphones on" policy where you are not supposed to disturb someone who has their headphones on. It may or may not work, as some people have their headphones on even when they are available, and others can focus without headphones. Other than that, without any explicit DND sign, someone in an open space should expect to be interrupted at any time, so you can just walk to them. 

Some companies will have a formal system for pay raises - you go up 1 point every year, for example. Others will look at market rates, or where you fit in the company's priorities. When you are negotiating a salary and a start date, it is acceptable to ask to see the salary grades / bands. These are usually restricted to being viewed by employees, so you're unlikely to get them before a job offer has been made. It is also possible that you can see previous years' salaries and determine what sort of pay rises you are in line for. That said - salaries don't always follow a patter. Just because your grade got a 5% bump last year is no guide to whether they will next year. 

Let's set aside the law for one moment (which will vary from country to country) and look at this from a different point of view. Why is your boss asking what's wrong with you? 

You have your firm answer. It has been two months and they are not interested in your application. I'm sorry - some companies just don't care about informing candidates that they haven't been successful. It's time for you to forget this company and move on. If they do (eventually) come back to you - do you really want to work for people who treat potential employees with such disrespect? 

It is not your job to decide if you are qualified, once the interview is scheduled. I assume there was a phone interview first, to talk a little about your background (academic and professional) and your experiences. If they still want to meet with you, it means they think you look like a potential match. No one wants to lose time, so interviews are usually not given to people obviously under-qualified. During the interview, be clear about your experiences, what you've learned so far, what you expect you'll have to learn then. Don't try to hide what you don't know, but don't throw it at them. Answer the questions, and don't sell yourself short. Since you are preparing the interview, learn about the current state of the art, find out what kind of technologies they are using (in terms of architecture, frameworks, methods, tools) and at least know what those are about. As a junior, you are not expected to know everything, but you are expected to know about a lot of things. 

Confront them about which it is, in writing. Either of those is bad enough. They should never have told you that. You may want to take a lawyer, gather evidence, and file for hostile environment or harassment. (Depending on how things work in UK, this may or may not be useful at all, though) 

While looking for a new job, find an employment lawyer (your union can help with this) and look at whether this constitutes Constructive Dismissal. All that said, if you don't want to look for a new job - ask your boss to put down in writing exactly what performance goals the company expects of you. E.g. answering all customer queries within 30 minutes, receiving no negative feedback from suppliers etc. Only when you know what they want, can you understand if you truly are underperforming. 

There is a cost of doing business. When someone is retiring, you might have to chip in for a leaving present. When someone is sick, you might have to buy a "get well soon" card. When you're going out for a team event, you might have to buy a round of drinks. These sorts of things can be tricky to navigate - especially when there are no formal rules. You're expected to take part in a social contract - and hope that you receive reciprocal benefits (a card on your birthday etc.) Making formal rules is likely to upset some people - "I can't afford to spend that much!" or "Why should I pay so much when Jo pays so little?" My advice? 15 weeks out of 16 you get a free breakfast - so what's the harm in buying for the team 1 week out of 16? In summary - 

I find that the difficulty here is that it seems people are calling your work phone, and are being transferred to your cell without necessarily knowing it. (Tell me if I am wrong, because the rest of the answer depends on it). They are not responsible for you getting those calls, and therefore are not expecting you to be anything different from when you are answering from the office. Before your calls were being transferred, you would not be here to pick up the phone, so people would leave a message or send an email, or whatever. Because of that, it is OK to not answering your phone. It will be just as before your calls were being transferred, and as if they were not transferred anymore. The only issue is with people who got used to call you and get an answer anytime. Go back to the receptionist and make it clear that you will not answer professional calls on your personal cell, and transferring the call will simply be a waste of time for everybody. Possibly advise your manager that you have been receiving professional calls on your cellphone, but that you won't be answering them anymore. (Also, do what enderland says. Ask people to email requests whenever you pick up the phone. Maybe install an IT ticketing system. Talk to your manager about this, and about how getting calls all day long impedes your productivity.) 

I think there is a risk - but it should be possible to mitigate it. The key is to emphasise why the skills you use in volunteering are useful to the business. For example, if you volunteer at a cat shelter and your job is feeding the animals - that's probably not going to help you get a job in accountancy! So, what are the aspects of your volunteering which will help get a job? 

For a large organisation, the HR department is usually the best bet. They will be able to tell you what the pay scales / employment grades are. They will also have resources to help you progress - there may be internal training, certification, or other services they offer. HR will almost certainly have a list of job specifications so that you can see what qualifications / experience you need in order to move up the ladder. For a smaller company, chat with your manager. Explain that you're happy in your role but want to understand what your career progression is going to be like - what she expects you need to do in order to get a promotion. 

Essentially, you're saying (quite truthfully) that you want to do more technical work. You're not badmouthing your former employer. You're not doing yourself down. You're pointing out that you're interested in improving yourself. Good luck! 

Don't You don't know for a fact what will happen in a year. No matter how strongly you feel about leaving next year, it may or may not happen. You may change your mind. You may find yourself enjoying your work and delaying your trip. You may meet someone who convinces you to stay where you are. You may find an arrangement with the company when the time comes. You may be compelled to stay for other reasons. The place where you plan to go may not be able to welcome you anymore. On the company's side also, many things can happen. It can fold. It can reduce expenses and remove your position. It can be acquired and downsized. It can be relocated in a place you don't like. It can change management and become unbearable. You can find that you don't like that job after all. It can take ethical positions you are not comfortable with. There is no guarantee on either side, and a year is a long time. The one thing you can do, however, if you have a good relationship with the company and the people you work with, is give sufficient notice before you leave to make sure they can prepare. (Find someone else and train them, for example). 

Signing an NDA at a job interview is common. It may not be useful for either party - but they're basically reminding you that learning about their company and selling that information to their competitor wouldn't be very nice. Whether it's legally binding really depends on your jurisdiction. If you are worried, show it to a lawyer - your school should be able to recommend one (or possibly has one for students). Secondly, compensation. Again, this really depends on where you live. Here's what I'd suggest. 

Yes. It is unprofessional. Ideally, you should be told of complaints as soon as possible in order that you can put them right. 

It rather depends on which country you're in. For example, I've got a 3 month notice period - which is fairly standard in the UK. Have they never asked you what your notice period is? If they want to hire you, they have no reason to complain about whatever the normal notice period is in your country. What normally happen is, if they want you, they'll send you a contract and you'll negotiate your pay, benefit, and start date. Once you've reached mutually agreeable figures (for example, they'll pay you extra if you quit before your current job's bonus is paid) that's when you hand in your resignation. 

You can't ask the manager to put an employee on vacation arbitrarily. I would assume in most jurisdictions, the demand needs to come from the employee, or be submitted to a discussion that involves not just the direct manager (like a mandatory shutdown of the company for Christmas week, for example). Also, you could be putting your husband and his manager in a difficult position, and you don't want to put your husband's manager in an uncomfortable situation of holding some responsibility in your plan. What you can do, however, is make sure in advance that, when you disclose the surprise, your husband's vacation request will be granted. You can talk with the manager to see if they can make sure they don't have something planned, and won't have, for the few weeks until the anniversary. Basically, something like: "Hey, I am planning a surprise vacation on such date, can you tell me if there is anything that would prevent my husband from requesting 2 weeks off at that time?" You'd still be taking a risk, because there would not be a formal engagement that the dates will be free for your husband to request vacations, but the risk will be much smaller. And you would not be putting the manager in any weird situation should anything happen.
