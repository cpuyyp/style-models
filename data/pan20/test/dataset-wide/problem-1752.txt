We manage a client site that has a file & print server on-site and our intention is to move their files / data to a centralised server at our data center. As the client has a very slow internet connection (adsl @ 5mbps), my boss has visited site to copy the data to an External USB Hard Disk. I've copied the data my boss had collected to the centralised server at the data center via USB. I now need to copy all the new files / changed files since my boss had taken the initial copy/seed of the data over the internet. I will need to conduct the cutover data copy using Robocopy (Over the internet, using UNC path - We have a VPN connection setup to link the new servers). My question is, will the below robocopy command do delta's (Keeping in mind that the original copy method to usb was done using the standard windows drag and drop method): robocopy "\Source" "\Destination" /e /np /r:1 /w:1 /xo /log:BackupLog.txt I only want to copy new files / folders that exist at the source using robocopy over the internet, and not the whole 1TB data set. Thank you very much for your assistance. 

BIND stands for Berkeley Internet Name Domain, is the most commonly used Domain Name System (DNS) server on the Internet. Named is the daemon used by BIND. 

You can telnet to localhost on port 25 and try sending the message from there to your local user account and then check the mails if the local delivery is happening. Then you can check of remote mail delivery to gmail is happening. It is always advisable to have a static I.P Address with proper reverse DNS entry set when trying to relay mails directly to the internet, the other option is to use a relay server, either the relay server of your ISP or a third party relay server. For incoming mails, the mails come in via the MX records, so if the MX records for your domain point to your server/machine then your mails will reach your machine. If the MX records for your domain does not point to your server then you can configure an application like fetchmail to fetch mails from your Mail Hosting Provider at regular intervals. There is yet another option where mails can be relayed to your server (say if you also have a hosted incoming email/spam filtering service) from a third party server and your server should accept/allow the mails from those I.P Addresses/ I.P Address range without any authentication. The actual ways of implementing the above is actually left to you. ps: I use postfix and Cyrus. Hope this information helps. 

^ For the company 2 account, you can see that I want to change the Modern Login Name from company2jamesp to jamesp (question is will this conflict and cause problems because jamesp already exists with a different suffix) I've done the above for one user already but is this OK to do? Kind Regards, Jake Ives 

.. For your information our Gateway server name is rdp.sparkorg.org To renew the RDS Certificate, I have.. 1) Generated a CSR in IIS 2) Completed the signing request 3) Exported as PFX (With Private Key) 4) Binded the certificate with the RDWeb IIS Instance 5) With the PFX, gone into 'Deployment Properties' and applied a COMODO (Previously exported) aginast, RD Connection Broker, RD Web Access & RD Gateway. 

I want James' company2, company3 accounts to appear in office 365 as: jamesp@company2.com jamesp@company3.com From what I understand, the only way I can achieve this is to change each users UPN Suffix & Modern Logon Name in Active Directory but keep the Pre-Windows2000 Logon Name the same - Example below: 

The PTR record is a must have for all Mail Servers that directly relay mails to the Internet failing which many DNS Blacklist will outright reject mails originating from the I.P Address and it could get your I.P Addresses blacklisted globally and many of the DNS Blacklists are globally replicated depending on the Blacklist. 

The 'transport_maps' option in the postfix main.cf is the one that should be used. The transport_maps points to /etc/postfix/transport.db file that contains the entries. You can add the transport entries in /etc/postfix/transport file and run the 'postmap' command which will generate the transport.db file. 

If the user is roaming, check if telnet to port 25,110,143 is occurring. Since you are not facing an issue with sending mails from the web interface a host of factors including connectivity, your hosts software firewall/antivirus settings or as a few other suggested before me, a corruption of your Mail Client profile could cause this to happen. If you have been provided by a web interface to sent out mails, try using that for a while till you diagnose the root cause of your current problem. 

Your directive is not valid. This setting controls which IP address ranges Postfix will allow relaying from. It should consist only of your internal servers and networks. It reads: 

The first type of firewall you have described is stateless. It is simplistic and does not keep track of connections; it just checks the given rules as fast as it can. This is not generally recommended anymore except in circumstances where firewall performance is a significant bottleneck, as it allows significantly more traffic than is obvious from first glance. Particularly, traffic which isn't associated with a legitimate connection can pass through such a firewall. The second type of firewall is stateful. It is capable of tracking connection states, determining whether a particular packet is associated with a known-good connection, and accepting or rejecting it. It is much better at catching invalid traffic than a stateless firewall. Without some overriding concern, all firewalls should be stateful for maximum possible security. 

I would imagine that the above is expected due to said session host having a .local internal DNS Name.. My question is, how do I renew this self signed certificate? The self signed Certificate is expiring soon. Thanks for your help! 

6) All looks to be good.. I presume I have installed correctly.. The problem I am having is: When I attempt to connect to a RemoteApp, I see the following window.. 

So a bit of a strange scenario here.. I work for an MSP who has a client that has recently moved to a Regus managed office space. The client has moved from their own offices where they had a full server infrastructure setup to this new managed office which does not allow them to keep their servers. As an MSP we have taken on the job of hosting their whole infrastructure from our Data Center - Each employee at the company we are working for is now connecting to their now 'Remotely hosted infrastructure' over direct access technology. While endpoints can see the remotely hosted servers (Over DirectAccess), our servers cannot see managed office LAN. Our client has printers which are situated on-site - We previously had all printers setup on the File and Print Server (Drivers, Spooling was managed from here). Even though the remotely hosted servers cannot see the printers on-site, we would still like add the printers to the File and Printer Server - I thought this would be possible by 'Turning Off Spooling' (In other words ticking 'Print Directly to the printer') & 'Rendering Jobs on the client machine' & changing the 'Printer Ports'.. The reason we would like to keep the printers on the 'File and Printer Server' is so we have a place to centrally manage printer drivers. Ideally what I am looking to do here is have machines print DIRECTLY to the printer without needing to spool or send any information to the server (Because no doubt the server will want to send information to the printer it cannot access). Is this possible? Thanks very much 

The retention of log files depends on the criticality of the data being logged and the actual size of the storage medium on which the logs are stored as well as the various compliance procedures in the geographical location where the Server is hosted. There is no hard and fast rule to the number of days the logs files should be retained though logs for at least a month ( space willing) would not be a bad idea. Storing old logs as tar.gz files is also a nice idea if space is a constraint. 

First check if your motherboard supports visualization, then go for Xen, Qemu or KVM whichever suits your need. 

named.conf is the BIND configuration file, you will have .hosts and .rev files for your forward and reverse look up settings respectively in your If your registrar is also your DNS service provider, then you do not need DNS entries in both places.
