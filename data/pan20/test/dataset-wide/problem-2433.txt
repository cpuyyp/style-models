If you call something Buddhism it will be attributed to the Buddha and should be inline with the doctrinal system the Buddha taught. If something is not what the Buddha said then it is wrong to miss attributed something to the Buddha as this is what the Buddha taught. A summary of the majority of Buddha's teaching is encompassed in the Wings of Awakening, 3 Marks of Existence, 4 Noble Truths, Dependent Origination. So if what Eckhart Tolle writes does not have these aspects and if what is found in line with the doctrinal system then you cannot call it Buddhism. Also some of the core teachings of Christianity and Buddhism are not compatible with each other, so any philosophy influenced by both is neither Christianity nor Buddhism. See: -ism 

Main motivator for all worldly beings is sensations. You chase after pleasant sensations or pleasures and avoid the unpleasant. In the above case one person is motivated by craving for a new car and the other is motivated by the goal sans craving. The latter might have a balanced mind in his pursuit keeping things objective but maybe slack as the drive maybe less. The other person may not have the same mental balance but may pursue the goal more vigorously. Being more vigorous may not be the deciding factor in the achievements of the goal ultimately. Loss of mental balance may motivate non conducive paths like stealing which might in fact hinder the achievement of the goal. 

I believe you can directly look into thought when you develop abhiññā. But at a lesser level meditation increases your ability sense the moods and emotions of people around you (spiritual awareness). This can happen though vipassana also as you stay contemplating internally and externally. 4 Modes of Mind reading as per Sampasadanīya Sutta: 

If it can be an example to others then maybe it is OK. Otherwise change the topic to something productive or something you can learn from. 

S N Goenka addresses UN Peace Summit So when thoughts arise see that sensation is associated with it, knowing its impermanence thus ensuring it does not proliferate to unwholesome actions or further unwholesome thinking. Once you have realized the distracting thoughts, know the sensation associated with it and seeing its impermanence, finally return to the object of your meditation. In case it is breath meditation then return to the breaths. This is the most effective way to let go of distracting thoughts. Also see: Sal,āyatana Vibhanga Sutta 

Conceptualisations are result of imagination and discerning them is difficult. When you start seeing the ultimate realities then you can see that certain concepts break down at a lower level of abstraction, then these are conceptualisation of one's own imagination. Also see: The Notion of Diṭṭhi by Piya Tan, The Dhamma Theory: Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma by Y. Karunadasa for more on this areas. 

(Paṭicca,samuppada) Vibhanga Sutta Also all worldly calamities, immorality and conflicts start with sensation / feeling: 

Right Efforts is about removing unwholesome states and cultivating wholesome states. Right Concentration deals with developing the Jhana as a means to displace certain subset of unwholesome states. Jhana is a wholesome state hence arousing Jhana can be viewed as applying efforts to abandon the 5 hindrances. This done through developing the Jhana factors. A mind with the Jhana factors aroused is wholesome. In short: 

When you have contact your consciousness react with some sensation or the other. If the sensation is unpleasant it is unsatisfactory, it is pleasant and changes or ends it is still unsatisfactory and if is neutral it is still unsatisfactory as wholesome and unwholesome roots which create future sensation are still present and the process of rebirth continues. If you crave to any of the sensations then you create suffering for the future, but if you are equanimous the seed of past karma which gave fruit will not find fertile ground to give results in the future. [Cūla Vedalla Sutta] So your ingrained habitual reaction to contact creates sensation which in turn creates sensation which lead to unsatisfactoriness with the contact and potential to create unsatisfactoriness is the future. [Cūla Vedalla Sutta] If you develop equanimity in the face of pleasant and unpleasant sensations than craving and aversion and wisdom in the face of neutral sensation, than the habitual reaction then you can overcome in contact with sense objects, will prevent future occurrence of unsatisfactoriness. [Pahāna Sutta, Avijja Pahana Sutta 2] I feel the authors is relating his understanding that the habitual reaction is what keep you rolling in misery in the future and this tendency to react creates misery now, but I feel the rendering is inaccurate as it is explaining causality by equating a result to the case, i.e., if A causes B then A is B, which is not the most right way to understand it. In my point of view "reactivity underlies dukkha" would be a better rendering. Some of the description above are based on: 

The buddha's ability to teach and lead people in realising the Dhamma is unsurpassed. Also his understanding is by far the best. Definitely having your paths cross with such an individual your be a great advantage. Having said this the Dhamma is there. You still can practice it and realise the Dhamma though it might be a bit harder these days. (Ability to find qualified high quality teachers, also the world being more materialistic and sensual and we lacking perfections.) 

This is restlessness, or the mind being scattered by many thoughts coming and going. Refer to the suttas on the hindrances, e.g.: (Nīvarara) Sangarava Sutta, Nīvarana,pahana Vagga. This is aggravated by Vipallasa (see Vipallasa Sutta). (These could lead to wrong conclusion and views hence keep the Samma,ditthi Sutta in mind.) Also see: Nīvaraṇa an essay by Piya Tan Thoughts are generally not good to dwell on unless they are directed at maintaining properly executing our daily activities and also perhaps some planning the activities and future. This cannot be avoided if you are householder. Also keep your thoughts on on what can be considered compatible or at least not contrary to Right Thoughts (Samma Sankappa). Thinking lead to concept proliferation and verbal fabrications which is at best avoided when possible at least during a formal meditation sitting. With regard to concept proliferation the following essay highlights how thinking leads to fabrication: Papañca-Saññā-Sankhā, Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought by Bhikkhu Nanananda. Also Madhu,piṇḍika Sutta covers the topic: perception and mental proliferation. Also Mindfulness in Early Buddhism, by Tse-fu Kuan contains though proliferation in the context of Vipassanā wich might be an interesting read. With regard to Verbal Fabrication the following Suttas deal with the subject: Mahā Vedalla Sutta, Cūla Vedalla Sutta, Kāma,bhū Sutta 2 

Also The Three Roots Inc by Piya Tan discusses multiple instances and issues which has arisen due to promoting religion like a business with profit motives. The Dhamma should be available for everyone for free has how it was taught by the Buddha and subsequently until recently. Any form of voluntary donation either in material or cash (for lay teachers) is fine as long as it is not solicited or there is a fixed fee. 

Some of these have been actively researched in Parapsychology. The Wikipedia link directs you to research efforts around this subject. These powers are not generally encouraged other than for teaching (Desana Pratihara). 

Your focus should be on what is felt (feelings / sensation) and their impermanence as in the Pahāna Sutta. 

Initially you some times feel in some parts and not the other. Wait for a while to see if you feel something or not. 

All problems do not stem from ego though wars and conflicts do. Existence is the main cause of having to experience these issues. Buddhism or any other school or thought or religion cannot solve what is a fact of life. But Buddhism give a way out of this messy exitance. 

Simply put it when you mind wanders away and you realise it 1st see what kind of sensations you are experiencing. If they are unpleasant relax your body and mind and bring back your attention to the breath smilingly. How you should relax your body and mind is to stay with the pain for a short while looking at arising and passing with equanimity. If is gross and solidified then pass your mind through these areas. This should be done a short time only, if it does not go away then just bring back your mind to the breath anyway. 

Madhu,piṇḍika Sutta Craving and clinging closely related to I and Mine conceiving (thinking about and mentally proliferating) as there is a subject who want or do not wants. [Tanhā Jālinī Sutta] Me and mine conceiving is through "thinking about" (from above list). [Sevitabbâsevitabba Sutta] So thinking about and mentally proliferation is related to craving and clinging also. 

As per Theravada tradition Dhamma has the quality of Paccattaṃ veditabbo viññūhi (To be meant to perceive directly and this experience in withing this life time), Sandiṭṭhiko (can be examined and the results been seen here and now), Akāliko (timeless and immediate results when practiced correctly). All this leading to the fact that you should practice for this life time though the benefits would also manifest in substantial life times if you do not get fully liberated in this life. You need some level of motivation otherwise you will not, 

I am looking for freely available resource on achievement of Jhana through Brahmavihara. What are such references? Also I would like to dig deeper into what Bhanthe Vimalasiri has written on the subject. So references on his teachings are greatly appreciated, but so would be works by other teachers. 

No. They arises and passes away moment to moment. Rupa / form part is left behind at the time of death. But still the process continues. At on instance there is passing away and then arising but the arising happens in a new body than where the passing away happened at the time of death. 

This is something you have to decide. There are many angles to consider. Some that I through of are: 

(Source: The Elimination of Anger: With two stories retold from the Buddhist texts by Ven. K. Piyatissa Thera) The bolded text implies they blame the other for one's plight. 

These are more inherent with the local culture and customs than to do with Buddhism. So they might change from region to region and country to country. The is no Buddhist wedding as such though some elements of Buddhism are incorporated like hymns (Jayamangala Gatha). 

What ever the situation you mention, what happens is your sense a situation. You perceive it as positive or negative and then mentally react to it. When you sense it you get a sensation and when you mentally perceive the situation you get a sensation. In face of the sensations and feeling arising in whatever situation you should try to keep your composure and equanimity. 1st at 

Self as a noun implies an entity which implies that the person is unchanging or has an unchanging core or identity. Self as a verb implies that the the entity has control. This is also not the case, though there might be some apparent control it is not absolute. In Buddhism there is no concept of Atman as this would imply. A being is nothing but the cyclical rolling forward of the dependent origination which takes a more of a process oriented view of a being. A being that is dependently arisen. Here there is nothing permanent, the next arisen person is not someone entirely different not the same, all constituents of the being are transient. This is more like stochastic process in terms of modern understanding. 

Addiction is related to sensations (Vedana) where we crave for sensation. Habit relates to Sanna where a reactive repetitively reinforced response to a stimuli surfaces. Self recognition or identification is mainly with distortions of reality (Vipallasa) in which one conceives permanence in oneself or on is in control though this is conditione hence habitual. This is reinforced by self identification with pleasure and craving for control or influence over different outcomes from which you might derive pleasure which stems from craving towards sensations.
