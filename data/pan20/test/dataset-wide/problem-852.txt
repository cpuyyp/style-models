To calculate that you will have to build a 3D model based upon the distance of each of their stars and then calculate the resulting 3D object's volume. I know this may not answer the question, but I give the way to answering it. It's not an easy job. Making a quick guess based upon the distances of the stars of both constellations in my opinion I guess the Small Dipper has a bigger volume since it's starts have bigger distance differences ranging from < 100 ly up to > 500 ly. In the case of the Big Dipper all distance are very similar since all stars come from the same open cluster. Their distance range between 78 and 124 ly. Source: 

I don't know any specific text but I can recommend you a course I took last year at Coursera.org. It says "introduction" but I can assure you it is really complete, 12 week that include a lot of mathematics and physics. $URL$ 

Yes, and not only from space but from the Earth surface too. Stars emit in almost all wavelengths depending on their surface temperatures. The hotter the star is the shorter (higher energy) wavelengths it'll emit. You can try this simulator to check this: $URL$ 

The deepest we look into the space the further in the past we look. So if we take pictures of galaxies that are 10 billion ly away we see them as they were 10 billion years ago. 

Nasa are sending humans to mars because it has a background of evolution very similar to earth, meaning we can discover more about the past and future of our planet. Mars had the capability to have life in the past, and if we can work this out we can answer the fundamental question: Does life exist anywhere else? Now, about humans leaving earth. Humanity will have to leave earth at some point - due to issues like overpopulation, resource shortages and NASA as well as many other scientists are planning things like human missions to asteroids, and eventually developing technology for a human mission into deep space. Astronauts on the ISS are helping us understand how the body changes in space (for example, fluids inside your body aren't pulled down by gravity). Furthermore, these astronauts are helping us prove the technologies needed for exploration into deep space. I found a site about stephen hawking talking about how we need to leave earth $URL$ $URL$ However, another thing about the matter of exploration further into space, and why we haven't encountered aliens is that some scientists believe that there a many, many, many sentient civilisations out there, but they wipe themselves out so quickly they never cross paths. Furthermore, there are so many things we need to think about if we will travel and colonise other planets. Like how the planet's gravity will most likely be different, the atmosphere will be at a different density. This is why we need to expand our presence in the solar system, and one day send a long term manned mission to mars. 

I've always wondered about this same question. In my opinion it could be possible, but I guess we would need a really powerful telescope to see proper images of the Earth through a distant mirror. I can also imagine instead of sending a distant mirror sending a telescope facing the earth. 

This picture was taken by the WISE (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer) space telescope. It is in deed an infrared picture of the entire universe but what you see in this line is our home galaxy, the Milky Way. This telescope has taken infrared pictures of the entire Universe (as we see from the Earth) and joined them in this full-sky view. More info: $URL$ 

The amount and kind of gases a body can trap depends on the object's surface temperature, and its density & radius (which refers to it's gravity). An object with high gravity and low surface temperature will be able to hold more gases in it's atmosphere. In the case of the Moon, due to its low gravity it could barely trap an atmosphere of Xenon. 

It all starts in a molecular cloud, which are clouds in space with high densities. They can contain all kind of gases and dust and also due to their densities and relatively low temperatures they also contain molecules like H2, CO2 and H2O. These are in a thermodynamic equilibrium until something disturbs them (usually nearby supernovae). For some reason a zone of this cloud becomes more dense and gravity wins to and starts to collapse the could until it forms a star. Theses molecular clouds can be the remains of dead stars or simply a bunch of gas and dust collected and hold at the high density zones at the galaxies spiral arms or arround the core. 

To answer this question, we need to understand what dark matter and a Higgs Boson are. Higgs Boson A Higgs Boson is an elementary particle in the standard field of quantum physics. It was theorised by a few people, namely Peter Higgs. The Higgs Field is a field which we can now believe exists, as we can detect it through its excitations, which become Higgs Bosons. The quantum excitations of the Higgs Field create Higgs Bosons. A Higgs Boson is a particle with no spin, infact, it is the only particle with no spin, electric charge or colour charge. It's also extremely unstable and decays into other particles almost instantly. Dark matter Dark matter is a heavily researched topic in physics at the moment. Out of all matter in the universe, dark matter makes up about 80% of it! One example of a theorised candidate for a dark matter particle is a WIMP. These are abbreviations of 'Weakly Interacting Massive Particles'. These particles are not normal matter, therefor we can't detect them. Our efforts to detect them include trying to look at the annihilation of WIMP particles. The main characteristics of WIMPS are that they only interact through the weak nuclear force or gravity. They also larger than standard particles (a dark matter particle with mass less than a electronvolt is classified as light dark matter) Wimps move slowly and are therefor cold, making them one of the main candidates for cold dark matter. Think of dark matter as a 'skeleton' for normal matter. Conclusion From looking at both types of particles, we can clearly tell that Higgs Bosons are completely different from dark matter. We are still trying to find out about them both, as both of them can answer fundamental questions in physics. 

As you say stars composition depend on the composition of the molecular cloud where they were created. You have a molecular cloud where many stars are being created at the same time, all with the same composition and age, but some are bigger than others. As time goes the bigger stars will die earlier, adding new heavier materials to the cloud which will lead to a new generation of stars with a bigger metalicity. So the star's composition not only depends on where it was created but also on how old it is. The best way this can be checked is by studying the stars within a star cluster.

Stars' light is produced by thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen, helium and other elements at their nucleus. This processes are impossible in planets since you need high pressures and temperatures >10,000 k 

It would be detectable due to its gravity effect on other planets, comets and the Sun. Check these sites for further info: $URL$ $URL$ 

Exactly. Seasons and its difference between northern and southern hemisphere are caused due to the tilt of the Earth's axis. But this is not the only thing involved. An other important fact is the orbit's eccentricity: a very eccentric orbit would cause a whole planet "summer" when around the perihelion and a whole planet "winter" near the aphelion. There would be also extreme permanent hot zones near the equator and extreme permanent cold zones at poles. 

Gravitational waves travel at the same speed as the speed of light in a vacuum, in general relativity. In special relativity, this is the maximum speed for any interaction in nature. 

This diagram can show us many things, for example, how black holes don't have a gravitational pull which goes across the whole universe. On a final note, we can work out the area where even light cannot escape by using the Schwarzschild radius. Seen as you said this answer shouldn't include relativity, I won't include any maths either. The Schwarzschild radius, in summary, is where the event horizon is in a black hole. Summary Sorry for providing a awkwardly long answer, I was having trouble understanding what you didn't understand, and I thought that if I explained a singularity - then I'd surely help you, sorry if I've just said things you already know. I've provided some Wikipedia links if you want to have a look at some of the terms I left in italics. You might also want to look at black hole thermodynamics 

Planets often circle stars because they have a very strong gravitational pull. Infact, our moon orbits the earth and we can look at a solar system in the same way. The earth has enough matter inside it to keep the moon in orbit, and the sun has enough matter inside it to create a gravitational pull strong enough to keep a entire solar system in its orbit. You can't have several stars circling a planet, the pull of a single planet wouldn't be strong enough (the planet's center would be so dense nuclear reactions would start occurring and it would be a star anyway) . You can have binary star systems though, which are where 2 stars orbit around their common barycenter. So basically, things orbit other things with a stronger gravitational pull. 

The Tidal acceleration between 2 bodies is calculated with this formula: $$ a_T = \frac{2GM_MR_1}{Dm^3} $$ Where $M_M$ is Mar's mass, $R_1$ Earth Radius and $D_m$ the distance to the Moon. If you equal this to Moon's Tidal acceleration you will get $D_M$ as distance to Mars to get the same Tidal acceleration having $\frac{M_M}{M_m}=8.73328184501$: $$ D_M = \sqrt[3]{8.73}D_m\simeq2.06Dm $$ 

A quasar is a type of AGN. Its main property is that it's galaxy axis points towards the earth and this way we receive its light and radio signals. That's why they are one of the most energetic AGN. Here you can see a relation of all the AGN types: $URL$ 

The Sun will never run out of Hydrogen. This is a common misconception. At this moment the Sun is fusing Hydrogen into Helium. This fused Helium remains at the core until it will reach a critical mass. At this point the core will begin to collapse. This collapse increases the temperature and pressure around the core where Hydrogen is being fused causing the increase the Hydrogen fusion which also causes an increase of the radiation pressure making the outer layers to expand and cool. Once the core reaches a temperature of about 100 million Kelvin Helium fusion starts dramatically (Helium Flash) with high radiation pressure in the core. Here is where the Sun will reach 250 times it's current radius. When the Helium fusion stabilizes the radiation pressure at the cores decreases making the Sun's radius to shrink. The temperature will only drop at the surface because as it's expands it's further from the core.
