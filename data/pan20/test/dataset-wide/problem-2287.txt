Why shouldn't I lift it? A snapper is built a bit differently than some other turtles, and is more fragile than it looks. Some basic facts about anatomy can help us understand why certain methods should be chosen or avoided. 

Many of my actual quotes come from an interview with scientist John Coppinger in July 2010, published in Discover Wildlife entitled How to avoid a hippo attack. These are his two opening paragraphs. 

After much searching I was able to find one (again no affiliation) that sells layers, including lightweight shirts, and outerwear, including field pants and field coats. They're not cheap, but definitely worth taking a look if alpaca interests you. It's worth noting that alpaca fiber doesn't wrinkle, or only a small amount, making it easy to carry in a backpack or anything else in which you store your clothes. Also, alpacas naturally grow in 22 different colors, which makes the choice of clothing more fun! 

I'm partially handicapped, and sometimes can only walk short distances without the use of a wheelchair, especially outside. I like to take walks alone in the winter (especially to see winter birds), but I don't have the strength or balance to walk alone on paths with snow; and I can't always ambulate in my wheelchair by myself on snowy paths. I can drive the back wheels myself with my hands, especially if I put my thick "winter wheels" on. However, the front wheels sink in the snow and get stuck. I've heard that gear exists to enable the front wheels to move smoothly along the snow, but I haven't seen it or met anyone who has used it. I'm only looking for something to help me on paths where the snow is fully packed or has up to a few inches of powdery snow-cover. I'm thinking about 

When birds gather into groups, they fly in a variety of different formations and patterns. Some birds fly in a formation that looks like the letter "V". Several species of geese, pelicans, and ibis are just a few of the more commonly known. This is their normal flying behavior, but can be more evident during migration due to the large numbers headed in the same direction. Many of the other common birds fly in swarms or flocks without any obvious pattern. There's also a type of flock, exhibited breathtakingly by starlings, which is called a murmuration. It's a group of literally thousands of birds flying in magnificent and unique patterns. I took the picture below over a lake in Rhode Island, United States, recently. The geese had just taken off and were flying in some side-by-side V-shaped groups. As they got farther away they gathered into smaller, tighter, individual V-shaped groups. Of course I've seen this behavior before, but on that particular evening, as I watched these geese leave the area, I began to ponder it more deeply. Why do some birds fly in a V-formation? Is it just a random pattern or is there a reason for it? 

The Iditarod sled dog race is a competition that takes place in Alaska, USA. Each team consists of a musher, who drives the sled, and 16 sled dogs. The race usually starts in Anchorage and ends in Nome. The total mileage is in the vicinity of 1000. Some people like to call it 1049 miles since Alaska was the 49th state, but it's generally somewhat shy of that. Having begun in 1973, the race takes place annually, usually starting in the first week of March. The Iditarod begins and ends at the same spot every year, but at some point along the way a section of it is split off for a portion of the race. In the even numbered calendar years, it goes on something called the Northern Route. In the odd numbered years, it travels the Southern Route. I'm intrigued by the different routes, and have a few questions. 

(That article didn't explain why the termite mound is a good idea, and I haven't done research yet as to the relationship between hippos and termites. However, I find that tip fascinating.) Supporting and additional references: Check out the site 10 fascinating facts about hippos from the Kariega Game Reserve in Eastern Cape, South Africa. It lists some of what I've mentioned here, and much more. There's also a beautiful video of the hippos during each part of their day, both in and out of the water. Sandiego Zoo Global African Wildlife Foundation Uganda Wildlife World Wildlife Organization Earth's Endangered Creatures I know you didn't ask it, but it's worth noting that we're much more dangerous to hippos than they are to us. The main predator of hippos is humans.. For years, people have killed them for their teeth and meat. In fact, according to many sources they're considered either endangered or vulnerable. Hippos have very few predators, and most sources list us at the top of the group. 

It sounds like you already have much of what he needs right in your yard. Anything you can use from your garden or trees will work. Tall grasses, short grasses, tree leaves, piles of soft brush and lightweight branches are all good. Soft-type hay is okay too. Long term: I know you only mentioned wanting to keep him comfy for a while on the porch, but in case you're interested in doing more, there are lots of good articles about how to create a year-round home for your new friend. Since you already have trees and a garden, you might not need to change a lot. Depending on your yard, the following might be too much, but a scaled-down version would certainly work. 

When American robin chicks fledge, meaning leave the nest, it is pretty much empty. It's also fairly clean, as the parents have been removing the waste from the babies after each feeding. Aside from the infrequent finding of a piece of blue shell, the eggs are notably absent once the birds have fledged. What happens to the eggs? 

The same source shows the image below. It calls it an example of how the builder's plate can look. The appearance of the builderâ€™s plate can vary according to manufacturers, the important thing being that the proper information is displayed on it. 

In August of 2015, my husband and I were out for a walk at the Wachusett Reservoir, in Central Massachusetts. It was the same walk, including day and time, as in this question. We stopped at the water's edge. It's the same water I referenced in this question, although the reservoir is large, and we were quite a distance from that spot. A lovely delicate-looking creature flew in and landed gently on the top of a broken twig of marsh grass, only a few inches from where we were standing. It had a narrow, stick-like orange and white body; a red head with large black eyes (which for some reason came out white in the photograph); four lacy orange/red wings edged in white; and very thin long gray legs. We stayed very still and it remained resting there for at least five minutes. Then another landed nearby and "ours" flew towards it, and they took off together. From past experience, I assumed it was a dragonfly. However, for the first time, I recently heard of something called a damselfly. I thought that meant a female dragonfly, mostly because a damsel is a female. (According to Oxford and other dictionaries, a damsel is technically "a young unmarried woman" but that has no bearing on this question!) However, I've been told by a friend that, although they're in the same family, they're two different entities with similar, but unique, characteristics and behavior. The first picture is the original taken by my husband. The others are the same picture, just cropped and zoomed in, so you can see more details, like the fur. As I said above, the white eyes in the picture were actually black. Unfortunately, we didn't get a side view, and you can only see the end of one wing, but I'm hoping there's enough to make a correct identification. Is this a dragonfly or a damselfly? How can I tell? (Of course it's possible that it's neither, but I don't think that's the case.) 

As you suspect, that squirrel in your yard is most likely an Eastern Gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis. Although they used to be primarily considered an American species, they're naturalized in many countries, and are commonly seen in Europe, especially Great Britain. Since she nests primarily in large trees, it makes sense that you've been seeing the mother feeding near your biggest trees. As to how far she travels from the nest, I can't say exactly. However, according to the Animal Diversity Organization at the University of Michigan, she has something called a Home Range, (described by some sources as approximately 2.5 acres), which she decreases while she's caring for her babies: 

An interesting article from The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Research lists causes of sea foam, most of which have been covered by all your other answers. It does say that the formation of sea foam varies by different coastal regions. While in general, sea foam is considered safe to humans and birds, and even beneficial, there have been instances where algal blooms can be harmful. This paragraph is relevant, especially since it mentions the California coast, but I'm not saying you are, or have ever, witnessed these potentially negative effects. 

We'd like to stay in a mid-range price category. I'm not asking how much to spend, just to keep in mind when recommending something that we don't want to sacrifice quality and features just to save a few dollars, but we also don't want to spend top dollar to get fancy features we don't need. I'm also not asking for brand recommendations, but would welcome any from people with experience. 

(Note: I understand there are predators on the beach, including humans, but the purpose of the question is about maintaining the health of the clams, not protecting them from predators.) 

My husband's brother came upon this tree while hiking up Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire, USA. This was his first time seeing bulges, for lack of a better word, like these. Knowing that I'm intrigued by such things, he sent me two pictures. He didn't photograph any other part of the tree, so I don't know its species or what the upper branches look like. The leaves on the ground look like maple, so perhaps it's in that family. I can't tell if something inside the trunk is pushing these out or if they're structures that attached themselves to the tree, and now have a bark-like substance growing on them. They almost look like old bee-hives. I suppose they could be something growing on stubs from branches which used to be there, but I doubt that. My brother-in-law didn't touch the tree, so I don't know if they're hard or soft, and I can't describe the texture of the pink and white substance growing on them and down the tree. Although the trunk looks strong, it has a green tinge in some areas which might be moss, or a disease process. I've learned the hard way that not every interesting thing in the woods is healthy, and I'm afraid that's the case here, although I'm hoping otherwise! Has anyone seen these before? I'd love to know what they are, and whether or not they're harming the tree. Click on pictures for full-screen view. 

Hippos in water: Like many animals, Hippos which can live up to 50 years, are at their happiest when left alone in their habitat, which is in water deep enough to totally submerge themselves, generally at least 5 feet deep. That said, they can be very dangerous to humans, mostly because in the event of an attack, we're not likely to survive it. It is therefore vital to avoid inciting an attack in the first place, whether on land or on the water (in a boat or canoe). Hippos are vegetarian, so humans are not prey. Even if they kill one, they just leave it there. That doesn't mean we can't be hurt, just that the reasons why they hurt us are different from some other animals. We're at highest risk when we act like predators. Hippos have to spend most of their time (at least 18 hours a day) in water deep enough to cover them because their skin burns very quickly, and they get sunstroke and die. (If they're on land in the heat of the day, such as during the dry season, they secrete an interesting substance which is designed both to protect them from both sunstroke but infection. It's red, so if you've ever heard that "hippos sweat blood" that's what people are referring to. This article offers excellent scientific reasons for this phenomenon.) Hippos can hold their breath for up to seven minutes, although they usually come up to breathe more frequently than that. That's a built-in behavior, and they can even come up to breathe in their sleep without waking up. Hippos live in large groupings, called pods, so even if you see only one set of eyes, assume that there are more underwater, and take proper precautions. Hippos can't swim, float, or jump, so they stand and walk around in water. However, they can run up to 20 miles (32 km) per hour as long as their feet are touching the ground. The safest thing to do while boating in hippo territory is stay in water deeper than five feet, or if you're in a narrow area, stay alert. Hippos don't like vibration. When boating in hippo territory the advice is to bang on your boat with an oar or paddle, or anything that will vibrate the boat. It can prevent hippos from coming up underneath you and capsizing the boat. It's also a way for hippos to track your presence. That doesn't mean you're safe, it's just a way to buy time while you go to a deeper area. Going to an opposite shore and disembarking is a good idea, but not always practical if traveling down the river to a destination. Hippos are ferociously protective of their young and will readily come to their defense if they feel that their young are threatened in any way. This is when they're most likely to attack. Think about what you'd do if someone broke into your house with your child sleeping in the next room. In this situation, we're in their house. Hippos breed, give birth and even suckle their young under water for up to 18 months, so it's not always easy to spot the calves, unless you see them at the water's edge. Adults start at around five feet tall, so if you see one shorter than that, it's probably a youngster. The best thing to do is assume that any large group of hippos you encounter includes some young that are being protected, and stay a respectable distance away. The first obvious outward sign of an attack in water is when they open their huge mouth. What looks like a yawn is a display of large teeth from a bull (make) hippo. If it feels threatened, or angry, it then lets out a very loud grunt, which is followed quickly by the attack. If you already hear that grunt, you're getting too close, and should immediately retreat. If you can actually see it, you may be in very serious danger. The attack can be a fight between males, a grabbing of an animal predator, or something else. Human or not, anything that threatens the family is at risk. If you're near deeper water, continue on, keeping a constant beating on the boat. Don't turn back, because you already know there's a family there. If necessary, find a safe spot on the other side and disembark. The hippo's very unlikely to come up and give chase on land. It would take him away from his family, and it isn't safe for him in the heat of the day. Hippos on land: You're safe on land for most of the day, as long as you're at a respectable distance from the shore, and aren't on a path with hippo dung. However, once the sun goes down, the hippos will come out of the water to eat. They eat an average of 150 pounds of food per day, all vegetation, so they have to use their land time wisely. They're often on the shore or a nearby path for four to five hours, and can travel up to 5 miles from where they got out of the water. That's not the time to stay in their territory. When they're ready to go back to where they want to enter the water, they do it instinctively and quickly, plowing down anything in the way. 

As with ants, edible termites include those found in and around the house. As long as you haven't sprayed with pest treatment or insecticide, there's nothing wrong with eating them. 

My second account is from "Backpacking in the Arc Dome Wilderness" published online at The Path Less Beaten. I know you've made the trip, but for others who are interested, this is a very long, detailed, report written by a man who made the arduous journey with his dogs. They were out for many days, and after one of their final nights in the wilderness, he writes this:
