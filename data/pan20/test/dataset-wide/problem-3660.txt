Eating anything will help you lose weight if you don't eat much of it. If you were to eat nothing but that cereal, given the most conservative estimate of 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day required to maintain muscle - a 150lb human would require 75 grams of protein. To get that from the cereal you would need to eat 892 grams of the cereal - almost 2 1/2 packets. This would also give you 700 grams of carbohydrates, 153 grams of sugar and 3321 calories. This is what is required for a sedentary person - an active person would need more protein so would have to eat more. You would get fat. 

Generally when lifting weights if you do a low number of reps it will increase your strength, and a higher number of reps will increase your endurance. However when it comes to the number of sets to do, I'm a little more confused. 

Supplements are not a solution. Once you have got everything else in order - diet / exercise / sleep, then supplements can be used to fine tune the process. That is all they can do. The supplements you have tried make you more tired. So stop using them. By the sounds of it you are leading a fairly stressful life. You have an inconsistent work schedule, you work out too much and you don't sleep enough (most people need at least 8 hours). This causes your body to produce Cortisol. Cortisol is produced by stress and is useful if you need to save your life in some emergency situation. However, what it does is it boosts your blood sugar levels and impairs your insulin sensitivity. This will make you fat and prevent your muscles from growing. It will also destroy your energy levels. To fix this, sleep more. You should be able to wake up each morning without the aid of an alarm clock. Work out less. Three times a week, for no more than an hour at a time is adequate. Some light cardio can take up the rest of the time if you need more... 

If you are going over technique with a coach the sooner you try out what you have learnt, the more information will stick in your mind. So I would stick with the Friday work out. Don't try to get any personal bests with your weights - but still move up so it feels fairly heavy and focus on the technique you've learnt. Overtraining is something that occurs over a period of time. One day isn't going to wipe you out. 

Think of the humerus as a lever. Top of the lever being the shoulder, bottom of the lever being the elbow.            As the bottom goes backward, the top goes forward:            Image source: Why typing annoys your neck, shoulders, elbows and wrists, and what to do about it You've probably seen that old cop move to disengage a suspect, where they pull the arm way behind the suspect. In other words, the further your elbow goes behind your shoulder, the more the humeral head goes forward, the more likely you get pain in the front of the shoulder. So impingement of the AC joint isn't the only concern. Excessive anterior glide of the humeral head can also cause pain. You mentioned you can't move the elbow as far back when the shoulder is abducted 90 degrees. That is, when trying to move the elbow back in this position, anterior glide of the humeral head is more likely. You have less room to move the bottom of the lever back before the front of the lever goes forward. This is one reason people feel better bench pressing with their elbows in, rather than out. Or, if the elbows are out, why a person will feel better with a floor press than a regular press. With the floor, the elbows can't go as far back. Example: $URL$ Impingement is a concern too though. As the arms get to about 90 degrees of abduction is when the shoulder blades kick in with upward rotation:           Made from this video. However, during a dip, we are doing the opposite of what happens when we raise our arms. When we abduct to 90 and past 90, we protract and upwardly rotate the scapula. During a dip, we're abducting the humerus, yet retracting (and possibly) downwardly rotating the shoulder blades. (For instance, someone who has focus on "shoulders down and back.") 

It's not easy fitting e.g. four+ hour workouts into a week. You almost always find everyday people basically do the best they can during the work week, then on the weekend have one long workout, trying to simulate the event the best they can. This is why first timers to these types of activities often end up destroyed after the event. By far the biggest mistake I see first timers do is, 

There are plenty of body weight exercises that could keep you going. If you find pushups too easy (ie. you can do more than 5 easily) make it harder by doing inclined pushups, or try one armed pushups. If squats are too hard - can you do one-legged squats (pistols)? A good book to work through during the week would be The Naked Warrior. Pavel goes in intricate detail about mastering the one armed pushup and the pistol. What you learn from going through this book will be useful for your Starting Strength program. Also, pullups and chinups will give you a good upper body workout - if they are too easy, try them one-handed. 

I have recently started doing the overhead press as per Starting Strength. I am getting a pain when I get close to the full extension of the press. It feels like a tendon pain as it is in a very small area at the top of the shoulder joint. The pain only occurs if I press more than about 30kg or so. What could be causing that pain? Or if its not that easy to tell over the internet what is causing the pain, what steps should I go through to try to locate and fix the cause? 

If all you want to do is lose weight, all you really need is a weekly amphetamine binge. Your goals are the wrong way round. Concentrate on being healthy first. The weight loss will naturally occur. Weight loss generally doesn't occur in a straight line. It fluctuates. It is hard to stay focused on a goal that is all over the place. If you work on health, 20 kilos in a year should be achievable. Weight loss is achieved through a combination of two elements - diet and exercise. Diet Diet is by far the most important factor. First of all work out what you are putting in to yourself. For a week write down everything you ingest. How much of it is junk and how much is whole foods? By junk I mean processed - white bread, sugar, basically all the convenience foods. This voyage of discovery will help you become aware of the challenges that lie ahead. You want to cut out all the junk. Eat only whole foods. Here is more information. Booze won't help as that is largely empty calories. If you cut out completely though, you are less likely to succeed in your goal. Just be aware every time you drink of what you are doing to yourself and drink less. As you get healthier your natural desire to get wasted does reduce, so just leave it up to nature... Exercise Exercise (cardiovascular) for losing weight is overrated. You have to sit on a rowing machine for 20 minutes just to work off a pint of beer. Don't have any preconceptions that you can just run for 15 minutes a day to work off that massive pile of fast food you are about to eat. However, exercise for health and happiness is vital. The more you exercise the better you feel about yourself and the more likely you are to stick to a whole food diet. Your first goal will be to just get yourself moving. I would recommend a Couch to 5K program. This will get you running 5 kilometres in 9 weeks. Once you are a fair way into the running program and are less sedentary you are ready to turn to the iron. Unfortunately you set the bet to lose weight rather than just body fat. The best exercise for losing body fat is weight lifting. As you build up muscle your body needs more energy to maintain itself and burns off yer fat. Unfortunately as you build up muscle you get heavier. However, it is still well worth doing. You will just have to lose more fat than you gain muscle. As a beginner this is certainly doable - advanced bodybuilders struggle here. If you can join a gym, I recommend looking into the Strong Lifts program. It is designed for beginners and won't take up much of your time. If you don't want to do this have a look at Convict Conditioning. It is a strength training program using minimal equipment taking you from beginner to advanced. Whatever you do, don't let anyone tell you to do loads of sit ups. They do not work. 

If it must be at home, then it really depends on the architecture and furnishings of your house. My friend's place has a floating beam in the living room, which is not bad for doing pull ups on. I don't have such a beam - not everyone is going to have something at home that's satisfactory for pull ups. So that's when you need to check out places outside of home. Playgrounds, alleyways, forests - get creative and you'll figure something out. Though be prepared to look a little silly! Edit/update: I've just bought myself a pull up/dip tower, and it's been a brilliant investment. I've done more pull ups in the past few weeks than I have in years. As nice as it is to not spend money, you ought to invest if you're serious about exercise. 

Cable flys - these were my favourite! Go for pulling from full extension, this is great for having a powerful pull at maximum reach. Slight bend in the elbow, just like your initial underwater pull. Biceps curls - pretty boring, but important Triceps - use free weights, extend from half to full. Heaps of ways to do this and they're all pretty similar. Shoulders - free weights, extend to horizontal on your side and front Rows - your traps are helpful in the pull sequence, but more so it's just good to work the opposite muscles so you keep your muscle development equal. Bench press - covers the above muscles quite well. Pull ups/machine pull downs - real important Abs with weights - whether it be sit ups with plates or pulling on a cable, it's all good - gives your off the wall dolphin kicks more grunt Back extensions with weights - just as important as the abs 

I've recently realised that I have very tight hamstrings - when lying flat on the ground, I can only lift each leg around 75 degrees off the floor when doing this: 

Seems like too many comments and not enough answers! You need to do backstroke along with freestyle, because: 

I know some people like to throw squats in the mix for more off the wall push power, but I'd say that it's lesser importance unless you're in some serious competitions. In which case, you would have asked this question to your team physio/gym trainer! 

From: Tibia Adaptation after Fibula Harvesting: An in Vivo Quantitative Study. I know the question was about adulthood and this study is on kids, but I want to bring it up because that change took 3.5 years. Yet kids' bones heal about twice as quickly as adults. So, to make a noteworthy bone thickness change in adulthood and you're looking at what is likely to be a significant amount of time. Easily years. That's a lot of consistent weight training. (It's not a surprise many with impingement issues have been doing a certain activity for years.) Even then, I doubt anybody knows an adult who e.g. had small wrists, then some years later could see the person's wrists were obviously bigger. I certainly haven't seen that with any of my clients. Where you start matters. Everybody can get faster or stronger, right? But you can't turn a donkey into a thoroughbred. The only exception to this I know of are acute injuries. Even in adulthood, after say, dislocating a finger, you can get some serious bony growth. Right side has been dislocated while left has not: 

This video is an example of trying to focus on the upper traps. The movement finishes at the top with a little extra elevation. If you did the opposite -some depression- you'd then shift focus more to the lower traps.     - $URL$ Credit and more about arm raise variations. Close up:     - $URL$ The reason for standing with the back against the wall is it's super common to arch the lower back when raising the arms overhead. That is, a person will think they're getting the arms overhead, but really they're leaning back to get that positioning. Notice how this person's hands are overhead,            But, that's because they're leaning back. In reality, their arms hands are not above their shoulders, but in front:          Credit and more details. I bring this up because this is an extremely common pattern, particularly in males who lift a lot. Where overhead motion is often lacking. Bodybuilder types spend wayyy more time in the horizontal plane, and pulling their arms down, than they spend pushing their arms up. One can view that as lower trap weakness being common, but that's fairly simplistic. Considerations like latissimus dorsi stiffness, upper trap weakness, and more need to be part of the picture. One tangential note- the order of upward rotation, retraction, depression, is important. You do not want to say, attempt retraction, depression, then upward rotation. This is the common mantra of "Pull your shoulders back and down!" If you do this first, it's damn hard to get your arms up! It's also a common impairment of those with shoulder pain. Where they lack upward rotation, retracting too soon, causing shoulder pain / discomfort. In my experience, overwhelmingly issues of the lower trap are with upward rotation. Not depression or retraction. That is, your average person with shoulder problems does not have problems pulling them down or together. They have problems raising them up. Coming full circle to usefulness- that's fairly subjective. Most are going to say overhead range of motion is important to them. Somebody only concerned with hypertrophy for the time being? Maybe not. That said, the lower traps rarely need dedicated work. For instance, overhead pressing will work them plenty. Many have a lot of scapular retraction work in their programs e.g. seated row, where the lower traps get worked a ton in that fashion. If you're simply curious will targeting the lower traps lead to noticeable hypertrophy / performance improvements elsewhere, then unless one of those performance measures is shoulder health / overhead range of motion, probably not. It's not like how a bench presser might want extra tricep work.
