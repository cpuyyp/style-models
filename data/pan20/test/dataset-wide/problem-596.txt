No. Between 2009 and 2010 the stanchion width increased by 3mm (so the spring followed), and the slider end of the 2010 spring is shaped to interface with the bottom of slider - whereas it isn't on the 2009 model. 

Just to add to the other answers: There are special tools, but they're just plastic wedges, so a flat blade screwdriver is fine. 

Stripping down the frame and regreasing the pivots won't do any harm, but certainly isn't necessary - I find it just makes getting the bearings out easier when they need replacing. Admittedly, after a wash I put a few drips of thick 3-in-1 oil inbetween each pivot - truthfully I have no idea if this does anything, but it probably stops water sitting in the bearing cavities for long periods. As for any other sealed bearing do not spray GT85, WD40, or any other water displacing fluid into them. They come pre-greased, and if the seal fails, it needs replacing. 

You seem to be forgetting the second-hand market, a grand can get you a fantastic 2-3yr old bike of any variety. If it was my money, I would much rather have a 2yr old bike that was worth £2.5K new, than a £1K new bike. Paint scratches don't affect the ride. 

You turn it on when riding on smooth surfaces or going up hill to improve pedal efficiency. It's hard to know if you will need it in advance because without riding the bike you won't know how well the suspension design handles pedal bob (the energy lost by the bike suspension compressing under pedal forces), try and get a test ride. 

For disk brakes I would follow the recommendations of the manufacturer, for example Hope have section on bedding in the pads on their disk brakes here. So before riding the bike in anger they recommend riding a short distance with the pads just scuffing on the disc followed by pulsing the brakes repeatedly so as to slow down but not stop. With rim brakes I've never come across any requirement to bed these in - the materials and surfaces involved are very different. 

Think about how heavy you are compared to your bike, so when your braking most of the momentum is you! You have 3 contact points with the bike, the handlebars, the saddle and the pedals and the best one to put the forces generated when braking through is the pedals, if you put all the force through the bars then you'll go over them, if the saddle then your relying on friction between you and it (slippery when wet). If you put the forces through the pedals you get more traction and stop faster as you push the bike into the ground. So in order to do this you need to get out of the saddle and drop your heels, as soon as your heels are below the axle on the pedals your momentum will be driving you down into the bike and then driving the bike into the ground. Moving back slightly can also help, especially if going downhill but it's the heel position that's important. Dropped heels also helps when just riding along, if your off (or on) road heading downhill at any speed and hit an obstacle, if your heels are dropped you'll sink into the bike and the chances are roll over the obstruction. If your heels aren't dropped that same obstacle will send you flying! You pivot up around your ankle and it's 'game over'. 

It's pretty unlikely that anyone keeps a list of weights for all the available tyres by width. Your best idea is to download the datasheets of brands/models you consider good enough (quality wise) and then compare the weights. 

According to Boca, they are 3/16" for the front and 1/4" for the rear. I see no reason why you can't run ceramic bearings in them. 

The bad news $200 won't get a new fork much better than the one you have now. The good news The second-hand market is full of a couple of year old forks that were originally twice that. Do your research Forks may look frighteningly full of tech, but they are designed to be serviced so the delicate parts are inside cartridges that can safely be removed. So if you see a fork you like on eBay for example, go to the manufacturers website and look at the servicing instructions - it will make your second-hand fork feel new again and only for the cost of new seals and some fork fluid (~$30). Play it safe 

I agree with the tips jimirings has stated, but if possible I would sell the Rockhopper and pick up a second hand jump bike - they're simpler bikes and park oriented ones rarely see the outdoors so tend to be in a better condition than their dirt brethren. The Rockhopper's geometry is wholly unsuitable for street/park riding, it's too tall, designed for 100mm forks, and has long chainstays; which all adds up to bike that doesn't want to bunny hop and struggles to to be 360-ed. It is designed for a completely different use and environment. And I say this with experience, I used to own one, and I also tried converting my sisters to a street style - absolute failure. 

Generally mud you want a skinny tire with very good clearing capability and depending on the mix of rocks and roots the hight of the knobs should be short. In situations where there is little rocks and roots, tall spikes work best. I have raced downhill for several years on the east coast of the US which is notorious for being muddy races. We ran mud spikes but typically I had two pair of spikes, one with tall spikes and one cut with shorter spikes for more rocky conditions. Mud spikes also have a large fillet radius to the spikes to allow them to shed mud easily. One factor that holds true for all situations with mud, the tire must clean well! 

Disc brakes - to me - are easier to maintain than rim brakes. Rim brakes take a lot of adjustments as you wear the pads. The pads on rim brakes have to be given more and more toe-in adjustment as you wear the pads to keep them working optimally. Disc brakes are far less tedious. I will not buy a bike that I am going to ride a lot with rim brakes. Six of my seven bikes are all disk, the only one that isn't is my dirt-jumping/bmx bike. Mechanical disk brakes only require minor adjustment when the pads wear down because only one of the pads actually moves in a mechanical disk brake, the outer pad moves in and presses against the rotor and against the opposite pad. So as the inner pad wears you have to adjust it closer to the rotor, typically with a 5mm key wrench. Hydro's don't have this as both pads move. If you consider the all-weather performance, longevity of disk pads, no rim wear, and cleaner upkeep (no rim black dust from pads). Disc brakes are a no-brainer. My most recent bike, a Jake the Snake Cyclocross bike, has mechanical disks but eventually I will put hydros on it later as an upgrade. 

If the cables are ok the next thing to check is the derailer alignment. The shop should have a tool to do this. You remove the derailer and the tool screws into the hanger. You rotate it to see if the hanger us bent. 

Another option would be Islabikes, they are a UK company but now have a US operation based in Portland. They are a specialist children's bike manufacturer with an emphasis on low weight and child specific components. 

Tracking down issues with brakes can be difficult. If the brakes are spongy feeling initialy and pumping them firms them up then you probably have air in the system. if that's the case then it will be a bad bleed or the seals or possibly the brake hose but working out which is often down to luck. If they just have no power it could be contaminated pads. If it was me then I'd do the following, give the system are realy good clean and finish off with disc brake cleaner if you have some. Next I'd re-bleed the brakes (having first pushed the pistons right back) and then fit new pads. Use the brake somewhere safe and then inspect everything to see if you can spot any leaks at the levers, hoses or calipers, take the pads back out and check for contamination with brake fluid. If you do have a leak then you'll need to replace the seals and/or hoses that have failed - this can be tricky if it the caliper seals that have gone. Getting hold of spares can also be an issue. It may be easier and cheaper in the long run to replace the brakes. Shimano Deore are relatively cheap and very efective. 

The same way you would for any paint: find a swatch that matches it, or chip a bit off the bike, and then take it to a paint store and ask them to match it for you. If it's a modern bike of a decent manufacturer you could always drop them an email, and they might be able to give you the make and model of the actual paint they use. Also remember you will have to lacquer it afterwards, and that has an impact on it's final look. 

You will also need to make sure the eye-to-eye length is same as your current shock (that's the distance from the centre of the pivot hole in one end to the pivot centre in the other), and that the stroke length is the same. If either of these is wrong, it will change your bikes geometry and possibly even cause the rear tyre to bottom out against the seat tube. 

Most MTB frame styles have roughly the same BB height, as everyone wants a better cornering bike and it's difficult to pedal over rough terrain anyway. The only exception I think of are pure downhilling frames, where a very low BB height is desired but to minimise pedal smashes, shorter crank lengths are the norm. Headangles tend to quite steep on most MTB frames even on very different styles, for example XC and dirt jump frames have similar headtube angles. Once again the notable exception are downhilling frames, which have very slack headangles; although this for improving stability when on steep descents (it's harder to go over the bars). The above is an oversimplification. In the real world the parts play off each other, and their characteristics will change as a bike moves through the rear travel (if it's got any of course). Also the above are frame characteristics; the length of stem, width of the bars, length of cranks, height of forks, etc. all play their part in the overall feel just as much as the frame does. 

Your comment suggests that these punctures are caused by something (thorns, nails,...?) piercing the tyre wall so the issue probably isn't with the wheel or the rim. So the question is should you change tyres to something more puncture resistant? In my opinion it's only worth changing tyres if the tyre is obviously worn out or is to light weight/low TPI for the riding you are doing and there are lots of other factors to consider: 

Creaks are always difficult to track down, where the sound seems to come from is often no guide to the source. What is often the cause is the rear wheel, especially if its qr. Take the wheel out, clean the dropouts and wheel axle, a smear of grease on the dropout and reassemble. 

There are two main types of cycle wheel, cup and cone and cartridge bearing. Cup and cone bearings are fairly easy to service yourself with some simple tools, normal and cup and cone spanners and some grease. Cartridge bearing hubs need more specialist tools, presses to install and drifts to knock the old bearings out. You can tell which sort you have by looking at the axle, if it's got a nut and a thin lock nut then it's probably cup and cone, google some pictures to see what they look like. If it is cup and cone then taking it apart (only undo 1 side btw or you'll lose the centre of the axle), cleaning the loose ball bearings you'll find under the cones, then regrease and reassemble may sort the problem; however if its actually as bad as you sugest the ball bearings may need replaced and if the races that the ball bearings sit on are pitted then the wheel may be beyond help. There are lots of videos on the web showing this process. If it's a cartridge bearing hub then your local shop might be the way to go unless you want to invest in some tools.
