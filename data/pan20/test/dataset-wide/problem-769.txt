As pointed out here, the limit of naked eye visibility for people with extremely good night vision is about magnitude 8.5. Neptune at opposition is much brighter at magnitude 7.7, so it should be visible to people with good eyesight. Astronomer Brian Skiff, made an attempt about a decade ago, he failed to spot it. He said that it should be relatively easy to spot from the Southern Hemisphere as it is high in the sky viewed from there. But surely many other people with good eyesight who are capable of seeing faint stars of magnitude 8 or even dimmer who work at the Paranal observatory will have given this a try? 

The core of the question has already been answered, but it's still interesting to illustrate just how difficult it is to make a naked eye observations of a the extremely bright nearby galaxy M81. The astronomer Brian Skiff gives an account of his successful naked eye observation of this galaxy here. Now, galaxies of a given brightness are more difficult to spot than stars of the same brightness, because of their extended nature. If the sky is sufficiently dark, then you can see stars as faint as magnitude 8, but you'll still struggle to spot M81 that has a brighness of magnitude 7. The magnitude 7 is an artificial figure obtained by adding up the light that comes from slightly different directions. Also, you only need very slight amount of light polution to make the sky backgound just a tiny bit grey to make the galaxy vanish from view, while the visibility of faint stars remains essentially unaffected. This is because the brighness as a function of the position in the sky in the case of a star has a very strong and narrow peak while in case fo a galaxy, due to its extended nature, doesn't show a big peak. The integrated brightness may be the same for both cases, but the amount of background light you need to make the galaxy invisible is obviously much less than what you need for the star. 

I was reading this article finding evidence of Universe's origin, which describes that in 1 trillion years we may lose the ability to determine how the universe was created. The answer seems to be using hypervelocity stars. These are stars that have been ejected from their galaxy. Using the expansion of the universe, we can use the velocity of the star to then determine evidence of the Big Bang. But how does this work? Is there calculations we can do now that agree with our understanding of the universe and its age when working with hypervelocity stars? I understand finding a hypervelocity star is very hard to do. I guess my thought here is that astronomers have modeled this scenario and found that if we were to find a hypervelocity star, we could then use the scenario above to calculate the age. I'm assuming the age calculated agrees with current estimates. 

What I mean by this, is imagine a person blowing up a balloon. As the balloon expands, the person blowing it up is also walking. At a much grander scale, apply this concept to the universe. As the universe expands, is it also moving like the balloon through infinite space time? 

During stellar nucleosynthesis a star will convert a portion of its hydrogen atoms into helium. Is there a constant of how many tons of hydrogen is converted based on the mass of the star? Is it based on a percentage of the star's mass? Or can it vary? A Nasa blurb stated that 600 million tons of hydrogen per second are consumed by our own sun. Is there a mathematical formula that can tell you how much any star would consume and convert to helium? 

I have just been watching a podcast called "Deep Astronomy" and the discussion was about a super fast spinning black hole discovered with the NuSTAR space observatory. This black hole was modeled with high confidence to be spinning at about 99% of the maximum spin rate. They stopped short of saying that the tangential velocity of this spin rate is "c" (and how can a singularity have a "tangential velocity"?) They did say that the event horizon at maximum spin of a stellar black hole is about 1-1/2 km. and that if a black hole were to spin faster then the result would be a "naked black hole" that would defy the laws of physics (GR). Also, shouldn't all black holes spin extremely fast (conservation of angular momentum) or would a retrograde accretion disk slow it down. Could somebody clarify this whole "black hole spin thing" without getting too complicated?? 

I know we have some indication of "what's in the water" from the plumes of Enceladas, but would other places be the same. For instance, could the deep liquid water of Titan contain dissolved methane gas. I'm mainly contemplating what possible "solutions" would be beneficial to some form of microbiology. 

Looking at this article: $URL$ , from an answer in stack exchange by userLTK, there appears to be at least two kinds of "Manx" (tailless) comets. One would be a rocky body that was ejected into a high eccentricity orbit during the formation of the inner planets. Another would be an ice-rock object diverted from the Oort Cloud that has lost most of its ice during close approaches to the sun (a "dead" comet). I wonder how we could tell the difference. 

In addition to the capture mechanisms mentioned by Andy, you also need to take into account the stability of any orbit due to perturbations from tidal effects. E.g. in case of our Moon, there are no stable orbits possible. Every satellite put in orbit around the Moon had had to implement course corrections to prevent it from prematurely crashing into the Moon. This effect explains why you don't have a lot of dusts and rocks in orbit around the Moon due to the large number of impacts. What happens is that after an impact you do get a lot ejecta, a small fraction will then collide with each other so that they get in an orbit around the Moon. But on the long term the tidal effects of the Earth and the Sun causes perturbations until the orbit crosses the lunar surface. 

A "one time only freak accident" is only going to be considered as a likely possibility when scientists gain a deep understanding how life actually arises and on the basis of that can rule out that life will typically arise on Earth like planets in habitable zones. We haven't arrived at that point yet. Scientists will not invoke "freak accidents" to explain something unless there is a lot of evidence that points to that; clearly such assumptions amount to making the assumption that there is no natural explanation, but that has to be justified by other evidence first. 

In the final energy state of the universe, there exists a hypothesis that all matter will have fallen into black holes and neutron stars. If, through Hawking radiation, after all matter is consumed and black holes eventually do dissipate, what is left of our Universe? I may be describing Heat Death, but I'm not 100% sure. However, due to the Law of Conservation of Energy, I suspect that energy will be all that is left, only in equilibrium meaning no ability for energy to form matter. In the event I'm wrong and there exists no matter and no energy, would the term Universe still be applicable here? 

No, for a black hole to form the core of a star much larger than our sun must collapse into itself, forming a singularity. This happens after a star has expended it's fuel no longer being able to offset the inward force of gravity. The result is a rapid release of its outer layers in a supernova. The resulting core then collapses into the singularity. The mass is so great that this singularity is an infinite bend in space time. Of note, if we took your object and were able to squeeze it down so small that it's radius reached the Schwarzschild radius, it could become a black hole. The Mariana Trench could not provide enough pressure to this. There exists little fish and organisms near the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Dropping something like a penny would just cause it be distorted by the pressure above it. 

I'll be honest. I looked up Galactic Habitable Zone on Wikipedia. The idea was introduced in 1986 and expanded upon in the book "Rare Earth" by Brownlee and Ward. Essentially the idea is that in the bulge there is too much activity (supernovae, etc.) and in the halo of the galaxy there is not enough heavy elements (carbon, etc.) for life to exist. This was in reference to complex life "as we know it" (Check out another Peter Ward book entitled "Life As We Do Not Know It"). Stellar habitable zones are based on the presence of liquid water. This definition would greatly increase the theoretical "Galactic Habitable Zone". I think we need to look at a region and calculate all of the pluses and minuses of that specific region then keep our minds open. 

I used to think that most terrestrial planet atmospheres were secondary (from out gassing). However, after reading this $URL$ and noticing that the ratio of CO2 to N2 is far higher on Venus than that just expected from out gassing, I have done a 180. I'm thinking that Earth has a primarily secondary atmosphere because of the Moon creating event and smaller planets like Mars just aren't massive enough to retain original nitrogen, etc. Would this cast a shadow on the idea of early extreme stellar activity ripping off atmospheres of close in planets?
