I had similar situation (not as bad as yours). I set up plan for each day, and told each person what I expected from them. And I would check with them individually on a weekly basis. 

If numbers aren't required, don't use them. You may find quality more relevant that quantity. Resume should list 2 or 3 tasks (and percent of time spent on them. These must add to 100%) Under each task, you list sub-tasks such that it falls into 

Can you do self-learning on your free time? From there, you can show more of your knowledge, your employer can give more responsibilities, and eventually a raise. Maybe you can strategize eventually starting your own small business, i.e see Small Business Administration. I don't believe they do background checks. And it doesn't have to be in IT. See what else you are good at. This was a shot in the dark. Best wishes! 

On a daily basis, tell what you expect from each Intern. The code must be speedy and error free. Regularly get up from your work, and check how the Interns are doing. Ask them to show what they have so far. If they say they don't have anything, ask them why not (be curious, not confrontational) Set up one-on-one sessions with all interns, perhaps 20 minutes a week. See if there are any underlying issues so at least you can change the situation and cover yourself At the end of the week, bring up all the positive points and thank them for work well-done. Sometimes no matter what you do, people are unmotivated. They rather have things handed to them. It's not your fault. You just have to adjust your sails in the storm. 

This seems like something I would probably be informed of at my next eval, not a rather informal email from someone a couple levels of management above me (I'm thinking the subjects of the email were CC'd by mistake). Given the size of our company, formal changes in your position are always done with at least two members of management present. This wasn't CC'd to my direct lead (or Jim's, Joe's, or Bob's), so I'm hesitant to ask them about this, but I'm really not sure how to respond to this or if I should just ignore it until I'm told about it in a meeting. 

Catess, since you've only put your applications in, I'd recommend not actively persuing one at the detriment of persuit of another. At this early stage, it's great to consider which jobs you'd prefer, but since you haven't been contacted for any of them, it'd be in your favor to make sure and be attentive and respond to all possibilities with equal enthusiasm. The ball will be in your court once you have job offers to compare, but until then, make sure and keep up with any communication and diplomacy with all three possible employers. One thing to keep in mind is in this situation, even an interview does not constitute an offer. Just because you've had an interview with your dream employer, don't skip out on contact with the others until you have the job secured. 

How does this benefit the team, the organization How does it benefit you, so the result is that is benefits the team, the organization 

After two hours, go to one of them and casually ask how is it going. Or, make it random. What if they are on social media with their friends. If they understand they must be accountable, they will start to straighten up. 

If motivation is missing, then you need to structure the work. Say, I expect ABC by the end of the day. If they don't perform, meet with them personally and ask what is the issue. Here you need to be confrontational. It's your job on the line. 

No need for that. A sweet email will be fine. Who knows, maybe they will take you out to lunch on your last day! 

Can you schedule time to meet with your manager in a conference room, office, etc so you can discuss without the peanut gallery? Surely, your boss must be aware of who is responsible for what, who is doing what (that what boss is supposed to do) 

In your case, tell them what you expect from them, i.e. I expect code by this time, with zero-errors. Sometimes, people need structure, other times, people will find excuse not to work. 

I've been asked to do mentorship in my organization (City Government in USA), which is rewarding because I get to teach eager employees (from other departments for 2 months at a time). On the other hand, I've come across 1 or 2 people (one is hard to fire, other has permanent City title and cannot be fired) who've, lets say have given me a run for my money. Now I am volunteering as officer role at Toastmasters to get "hands-on" leadership training, and I'm dealing with an especially toxic person (acts nice to your face, but does opposite when you are away). And this person happens to work at my organization (different building though) Question: Please recommend books that will enhance my understanding. Perhaps show me how to create healthy boundaries, i.e. a ship is surrounded by water, but the ship is built so water does not get in.

While I try my best to make sure that anyone who I may be working with knows I will be out of office anytime I'm out for 8+ hours, I realize that that is a very easily forgotten fact. I've been toying around with the idea of setting my OoO message the day before I leave, to let people know that I will be gone tomorrow and possibly following days. This allows people to ask me any questions they have that may turn into blocking issues while I'm gone. On the other hand, I realize that people see the out of office message and may assume I'm out of office now, which sends the wrong message. So, my question really is, is it common to start the out of office auto-reply a few hours before I actually leave so that people can get any last minute questions in? 

You have to remember, there are a lot of things actually going on when you are at your office chair (or your bed with a laptop). Here are a few common aggrevations from office life, some I didn't even think of until they were pointed out to me. Keyboard 

I would suggest leaving these off without further study. It's great that you got some hands-on time with Java, Python, Ruby, and Selenium, but if I were interviewing you and you said you gained valuable in-depth experience with all of these technologies in only a week (you mentioned you were fired from the last position after only a week), I'd be very VERY skeptical, to the point that it would almost hurt your chances. Honestly, I feel like you should leave the position off your resume, and only post it in your work history. If the interviewer asks about it say something like "I was let go due to XYZ, but XYZ has been fixed". Assuming XYZ is innocuous, something like say, lack of reliable transportation, then it shouldn't hurt you too much. It might help get more quality answers about how to approach the situation if you were to post why you were let go as well. 

Oh wow. And after you were hostile, they are still bothering you. They probably thinks this is a full-out war. That's quite immature of them though. 

Your management is also at fault. They should understand that managing interns (interns, not seasoned employees who have seen the world) takes time and dedication. To re-iterate 

Are these coworkers straight out of college? Perhaps college interns. Sometimes they behave that way because they don't understand real-world. Or they can just be annoying people 

So far, I have my current supervisor, and past supervisor whom I can ask. How do I approach? Do I simply say, please register for this online system, or do I create an account and password for them, ask them to log in and change it. Is there anything else I should do Bottom Line: How to make it easy for supervisors past and present to provide letter of recommendation for this online format? 

Is this person's behavior making everyone's productivity suffer? If so, it is a loss to our organization, and this person is a liability. Something to bring to upper management. You counseled the said employee, he refuses to change, it is affecting performance of others, you are losing profits, your organization's bottom line. 

I disagree. There are infinite ways one can always show they are adding value, build relationships. As long as there is a lot of work to do, a lot of things to innovate, then their is an ocean of such opportunity, one needs to ask themselves how else they can contribute. 

So, I am the SME in one area, and a backup SME in an area that overlaps. I cover my coworker's (Let's call him John) area while he's on PTO, and he does mine. A few weeks ago, he came by to let me know that he would be leaving the company as a heads up, but asked me not to discuss it with anyone. I kept silent, assuming he would give a customary two weeks notice, at which point we could start planning a shift of responsibilities. His final day is a little over a week away, and we're getting to the point where I really should start talking to my manager to let him know my attention is going to be divided. While the two areas overlap, there is generally enough work to do in both that it will affect my performance trying to cover both areas, I would like to Inform my boss in advance so he can plan. The thing Is, I want to respect my coworkers wishes (he didn't need to tell me). I've asked him about it and he said "He'll let them know" but isn't telling me when. How can I approach this situation? Edit: As per Alroc's comment, dual coverage is a company standard to improve bus factor. Every person has a dedicated backup (most of the time it's a paired backup in two related areas, but sometimes not). Additionally, to my knowledge. I'm the only person he has told. I know explicitly that he has not told our team lead. 

There is not much you can do to address the situation, you are at their mercy. If you have many interviews lined up and many job offers you have the option to reject job offer from company with disrespectful interviewers. I've noticed rudeness occurs when they are doing "due diligence" of interviewing you because 

At the end of day, you need to connect your 2 or 3 tasks with the result that benefits your organization 

Ask what have they done to solve the problem so far. Lot of times, people can troubleshoot their own problem and learn in the process. If your friend attempted to find a solution and was unsuccessful, then offer your time to help 

Next time you encounter this type of behavior you can POLITELY ask "how well do you think I fit for this position?" ... perhaps they will be attentive and/or give courtesy to end interview early. But don't discount disrespectful interviewers. I had this type of experience once and was STILL given job offer 

Well here is the problem. Lot of people are scared of sharing information, also known as collaboration. But I think if more you share, more others will eventually share with you, or more opportunities will open. And certainly the coworkers will start to warm up, and you can find the relationship beneficial. If you have too much work on your hands, you can get their help. Do this slowly and steady, so you all feel comfortable. 

So, I'm considering going out job hunting again, and I've read it's always good to have a portfolio of your work handy. Unfortunately, the results of my work are rather boring to most people (An JavaScript/html calendar similar to JQuery's day-picker, an active html analog clock, etc). Alternatively, I have side projects that are more interesting (an Arduino sketch for a player-guitar, an Arduino sketch for an led grid that simulates light patterns similar to what you'd find on the bottom of a pool under moving water), but less useful in the real world. I'm trying to not be too broad or make a question which only has subjective answers, but I'm also trying to understand what sort of code and projects a recruiter might be interested in. I feel like my utilitarian code is more useful in the real world, but my side projects show more of an aptitude and ability to problem solve. Which would a recruiter be more interested in? 

I'm being sent by my employer to a conference in another state. Having barely traveled of my own accord, I know nothing about how travel works, especially when (partially?) paid for by someone else. What questions should I ask my manager before I go? At this point, I don't know what I don't know. Things that may seem common place that I've never had to manage before 

Screens Screen brightness is a pretty rough thing in your eyes. Play with your screens, make sure that they only case as much light as they need to in order to be visible, and no more. A lot of folks prefer warmer colors as well. If your eyes are hurting, it may be worth it to consider trying some filtered glasses - The jury is still out on the long term benefits, but in the short term after eight hours in front of three monitors, my eyes don't hurt as much when wearing my pair.
