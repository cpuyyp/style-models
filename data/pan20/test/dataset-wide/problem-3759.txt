I agree with John Bentin, that the question has little sense in the formal category. Let me restrict myself to the simpler question of factorization into linear factors (so everyting will be over complex numbers). A formal infinite product $(1+a_1x)(1+a_2x)(1+a_3x)...$ makes no sense, because we have to sum infinite series to obtain the coefficient at $x$. For this reason I disagree with solution of Will Sawin. The product $(1+a_1x)(1+a_2x^2)...$ does make sense, formally, but after you factor each multile into linear factors, it does not, even formally! So let us restrict to convergent series and products. Then the next question, of course, is "where are they supposed to converge?" If we want convergence in the whole plane, a satisfactory answer can be given. This is not exactly Weierstrass, but Weierstrass combined with Hadamard: If $$\rho:=\limsup\frac{n\log n}{-\log|a_n|}\; \; \; < 1,$$ then $$1+a_1x+a_2x^2+\ldots=(1+c_1x)(1+c_2x)\ldots,$$ and both sides are convergent in the ordinary sense in the whole plane. Notice that some convergence of $$\sum c_n$$ is necessary just to make sense of the RHS. If this series of $c_n$ is ABSOLUTELY convergent, then then the right hand side is convergent in the whole plane, so it defines the left hand side (the power series, and for this power series $\rho\leq 1$ must hold. So we see that the condition $\rho<1$ is almost best possible. The case $\rho=1$ can be also completely studied, but this is somewhat more complicated, and for this I refer to B. Levin, Distribution of zeros of entire functions, AMS, 1964. Let me repeat the main point. For the product $(1+c_1x)(1+c_2x)\ldots$ to make sense, even FORMALLY, the series of $c_n$ must converge. Now, of course one can discuss various meanings of this convergence. But if it converges in the most usual sense, that is absolutely, the product converges in the whole plane, and we are within the subject of entire functions. Exact condition on the coefficients of the power series can be written, and for this I refer to Levin's book. So a necessary and sufficient condition on the series which guarantees that it has a product expansion with linear factors can be given. Passing from complex to real product is routine, of course. 

If there is a family of objects parametrized by points $a$ in some topological space $X$ they usually say that "an object is in general position" (or "generic") to mean that $a$ belongs to an open dense subset of $X$. This notion of course depends on topology on $X$. When $X$ is an algebraic variety, say over $R$ or $C$, one can consider two natural topologies: the usual one and Zariski one. I think this applies to all examples given in the question and in the answer of Sandor. 

First of all, it is sufficient to consider only one parameter: making a change of the independent variable $z\mapsto kz$, with appropriate $k$ one can eliminate either $a$ or $b$. Let us eliminate $b$ and consider $$-y''+(x^4+ax^2)y=\lambda y.$$ Then eigenvalues (in $L^2(R)$) become functions of $a$, and the asymptotics is $$\lambda_n\sim cn^{4/3},$$ where $c$ is an absolute constant (it does not depend on $a$). One can write several terms of asymptotic expansion in decreasing powers of $n$, coefficients of these further terms will depend on $a$. In fact one can write and prove an infinite asymptotic expansion, but the resulting series is divergent. (In the general case of a polynomial potential, $V(x)=x^m+\ldots,\;x\to\infty$, the order of growth of eigenvalues is $2m/(m+2)$, see Sibuya and Shin below). These functions $\lambda_n(a)$ were very much studied, I mention first of all the paper: C. Bender and T. Wu, Anharmonic oscillator. Phys. Rev. (2) 184 1969 1231–1260. This paper has more than 1000 references on Google scholar. By looking in these references you can obtain a more or less complete picture of what is known. (The situation is roughly like this: all statements in this paper are correct, and it contains a very complete discussion of these eigenvalues. However most of the things are proved on the "physical level of rigor", or just illustrated by computation. In the subsequent papers most of these statements were rigorously justified.) If you are only asking about asymptotic expansion for real $a$, it is written explicitly in Bender-Wu, and it is easy to justify. The difficult thing is proving the global analytic properties of $\lambda_n(a)$, for complex $a$. These functions are very complicated, indeed. Some principal mathematical papers which discuss them are: B. Simon, Coupling constant analyticity for the anharmonic oscillator, Ann. Phys., 58 (1970) 76–136. A. Voros, The return of the quartic oscillator, Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare. Section A, Physique Theorique; v. 39(3); 1983, p. 211-338. B.

Sibuya, Global theory of a second order linear differential equation with a polynomial coefficient, North Holland, 1975. EDIT. The leading term of the asymptotics $n^{4/3}$ is not difficult to obtain. By WKB there exists a unique solution satisfying $$y(x,\lambda)=(1+o(1))x^{-1}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{3}x^3\right),\; x\to+\infty.$$ For every $x$ this is an entire function of $\lambda$, and $$y(0,\lambda)= \exp\left(K\lambda^{3/4}-(1/4)\log\lambda+o(1)\right).$$ Zeros of this function or zeros of the derivative $(d/dx)y(x,\lambda)$ at $x=0$ are eigenvalues. From this the asymptotics of eigenvalues are easily obtained. 

In general, the answer is no. This is a difficult problem and there was a lot of research on it. For example, for a metric with positive curvature there is also an embedding. The answer also depends on the degree of the smoothness of the metric. Here is a recent survey: MR2261749 Han, Qing; Hong, Jia-Xing Isometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds in Euclidean spaces. See also MR0133090 Pogorelov, A. V. On the isometric immersion of a two-dimensional Riemannian manifold homeomorphic to a sphere into a three-dimensional Riemannian space, (Russian) Dokl. Akad.

This is a simple example for the Laplace Method of asymptotic evaluation of integrals. The essence of the method is that the main contribution to the integral comes from a small neighborhood of the critical point of the function under the exponent. Laplace method is explained in every serious calculus book. For more comprehensive treatment see the books of Fedoryuk, for example, Fedoryuk, M. V. (1987), Asymptotic: Integrals and Series, or here: $URL$ 

There is such a factorization, with $n=1$. Let us suppose first that the annuli are non-degenerate, and the boundaries are sufficiently smooth, and $\phi$ sends the outer boundary of $A$ to the outer boundary of $A'$. Then $\phi$ has a quasiconformal extenson, say $\Phi$ which is a homeomorphism between the spheres. Let $\mu=\Phi_{\overline{z}}/\Phi_z$ be the Beltrami coefficient of $\Phi$. It naturally splits into two parts $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ supported on the outside and on the inside. Now consider a homeomorphic solution $\Phi^+$ of the Beltrami equation $\Phi^+_{\overline{z}}=\mu^+\Phi_z$. It is a homeomorphism of the sphere, conformal inside the outer component of $A$. It maps $A$ onto some $A_1$ conformally. Using this map, we push forward $\mu^-$ to the inside component of $A_1$ and obtain a new Beltrami coefficient $\nu$ on the inside component of $A_1$. Then solve the Beltrami equation ${\Phi^-}_{\overline{z}}=\nu{\Phi^-}_z$. The composition $\psi=\Phi^-\circ\Phi^+$ is a quasiconformal map with the same Beltrami coefficient as $\phi$. Therefore $\psi=L\circ\phi$ where $L$ is fractional-linear, and we obtain a required factorization: $\Phi^+$ is conformal on the complement of the outside component of $A$ and $\Phi^-$ is conformal on the complement of the inside component of $A_1$. To do the general case, consider an exhaustion of $A$ by annuli with anaytic boundaries, say $A=\lim A_n$.Then $A_n'=\phi(A)_n$ also have analytic boundaries, and the previous argument applies. Now, it is not difficult to prove, using a normal family argument that the limit of these factorizations will give the required factorization of $\phi$. The degenerate cases (when one boundary component is a point) are easy, by the removable singularity theorem. Reference for this techniques: Ahlfors, lectures on quasiconformal mappings. (It also has a complete proof of the existence of a homeomorphic solution of Beltrami equation, though we did not use the full strength of this theorem: in our setting all Beltrami coefficients can be chosen smooth in which case the required existence theorem is just the uniformization theorem for the special case of the sphere.) 

A counterexample is $$f=\sqrt{y^2+e^{-x}}.$$ You can verify by computing the second derivatives that this is convex. As a sequence $x_n$ you can take $(n,1/n)$. Then $f(x_n)\to 0$ but the derivative with respect to $y$ tends to 1. Thus the gradient does not tend to 0. 

Include it in your paper, and write clearly that on your opinion this is a known result but you could not find a reference. You can never be sure that this result has not been published by someone, and you just don't know. 

The commonly accepted term is "completely invariant". A set which is mapped to itself is called simply "invariant" and a stronger property to coincide with its preimage is called complete invariance. Sometimes "complete invariance" refers to a weaker property that a) the set is invariant, and b) the full preimage is contained in the set. EDIT. On your further questions: For a reference, see for example the survey "Dynamics of analytic transformations", Leningrad Math. J. (1990). (It is avalable on my web site). 

This seems to be modeled by the "shortest networks" on which Frank Morgan had run an undergraduate research project. A short description (2 pages) is in: F. Morgan, Riemannian Geometry. A beginner's guide, Jones and Bartlett Boston 1993. The references there are: F. Morgan, Compound soap bubbles, shortest networks and minimal surfaces, AMS video 1992, C. Adams D. Bergstrand, F. Morgan, The Williams SMALL undergraduate research project, UME trends, January 1991. F. Morgan, Minimal surfaces, crystals, shortest networks, and undergraduate research. Math. Intelligencer 14 (1992), no. 3, 37–44. 

Let me explain a heuristic argument which is probably possible to convert into a proof. Let us deal with the ring. The covering will have degree $d=d_1+d_2$ and by Riemann-Hurwitz will have $r=d$ critical points. We can construct a Riemann surface spread over the disk with $r$ critical points which can be chosen arbitrary. This gives us $2r$ real parameters. Minus 3 parameters of the group of conformal automorphisms of the disc, $2r-3$ real parameters. But conformal classes of rings depend on 1 real parameter. Thus if $2r-3\geq 1$ we should be able to obtain every given ring in this way. Similar parameter count works in general. This indicates that one can try to prove the result "by continuity". Here are the details for the ring: Imagine a two-sheeted Riemann surface over the unit disk, with branch points at $t,-t$, where $0<t<1$. This Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to a ring (by the Riemann Hurwitz) and the modulus of this ring is a function of $t$. When $t\to 0$, the modulus tends to $0$, when $t\to 1$, it tends to infinity. So for various $t$ we obtain all rings, and this construction gives the Ahlfors function of the ring. Now modify our surface. On each of the two sheets make a vertical cut from $0$ to $i$. And glue a $d_1-1$ sheeted disk with the similar cut along the cut to the first sheet and $d_2-1$ sheeted disk to the second sheet. You obtain a Riemann surface whose boundary consists of a $d_1$ sheeted circle and a $d_2$-sheeted circle, both lying over the unit circle. It has $4$ branch points: two over $0$ connecting $d_1$ and $d_2$ sheets, respectively, and two over $t,-t$ connecting two sheets each. It is clear that this new surface is a ring. (By Riemann-Hurwitz, or just by examining the gluing procedure). Moving $t>0$ from $0$ to $1$, we obtain rings of all possible moduli, by an easy argument with extremal length. This proves your conjecture for a ring. I believe that similar method will work in the general case. 

They are localy Holder continuous. There is a map $\phi$ from the plane to the cone which is bijective, the inverse is Holder, and $\phi$ is conformal except one point. This map can be written explicitly. Let your map be $f$. Composition $g=f\circ\phi$ is harmonic except one point, so by removable singularity theorem it is harmonic everywhere, thus locally Holder. So your map $f=g\circ\phi^{-1}$ is locally Holder. The Holder exponent depends on the opening of the cone. 

$f\in C[[x+iy]]$ means $f(x,y)=g(x+iy),$ where $g\in C[[z]]$. Then $$f_x=g'(x+iy),\; f_y=ig'(x+iy),$$ therefore $f_y=if_x$ and this is Cauchy-Riemann: indeed, if $f=u+iv$ then $f_x=u_x+iv_x$ and $f_y=u_y+iv_y$, so $f_y=if_x$ is equivalent to $u_x=v_y$, $u_y=-v_x$. To prove the converse, make the linear change of the variables: $z=x+iy,\; \overline{z}=x-iy$. A simple calculation shows that $f_z=(1/2)(f_x-if_y),\; f_{\overline{z}}=(1/2)(f_x+if_y).$ Then the Cauchy-Riemann conditions in the new variables become $f_{\overline{z}}=0$. Assuming that this is satisfied, set $h=f_z$. Then $$h_{\overline{z}}=f_{z\overline{z}}=f_{\overline{z}z}=0,$$ so $h$ does not depend on $\overline{z}$ that is $h\in C[[z]]$. Taking an antiderivative of $h$ in $C[[z]]$ we obtain the $g$ as above. Remark. This is how old textbooks like Whittaker-Watson explain the Cauchy-Riemann conditions. Pure algebra. 

As it was stated above, the answer depends on the choice of exposition. My favorite way is to define $e^z$ by a power series. Then Euler's formula becomes the DEFINITION of sine and cosine. You quickly derive all properties of sine and cosine from it. And then, if the students already know some other definition of sine and cosine, you show that this is the same thing. Another approach is assuming that definitions and properties of sine and cosine were already established, one can define $e^z$ by the Euler formula, and derive all properties of the exponential from the properties of sine and cosine. This way is usually chosen by the authors of very elementary CV texts. But I like the first way. In both variants Euler's formula is a definition. But of course, one can define sine and cosine and exponential separately and independently, and then prove Euler's formula as a theorem. (This is what Euler probably did). 

Here is a simple proof without Hahn-Banach. I assume that the complex Radon measure is finite. Then your representation would imply $$|\lim_{\lambda\to 0}f(\lambda)|\leq C\max_{K}|f(z)|,$$ which is evidently not true. 

Such maps are called quasiregular. There is a highly developed theory of them. Most of the classical theory you can find in the books of Yu. Reshetnyak, Space mappings with bounded distortion, AMS, 1989, and S. Rickman, Quariserular mapings, Springer, 1993. Probably the most fundamental fact about such maps is that they are open and discrete. In dimension 2 their structure is quite simple: they are compositions of complex analytic functions with homeomorphisms. Also if such a map is sufficiently smooth (in any dimension) then it is a quasiconformal local homeomorphism, and if smooth and defined in the whole $R^n$ then it is a global homeomorphism. But if you relax the smoothness conditions you can have many interesting maps which are subject of study in this theory, the simplest example is $(r,\theta,z)\mapsto (r,2\theta,z)$ in cylindrical coordinates in dimension 3. But a complete answer on your question "what can be said?" will have length of a large book. 

The conjecture is correct. Let me begin with a simple proof that $|M|\leq 2n$. The curve $|P(z)|^2=\mu^2$ is a real algebraic curve of degree $2n$. At the points of $M$ this curve must be tangent to the unit circle. The unit circle is a curve of degree $2$, therefore by Bezout theorem these two curves have at most $4n$ intersections counting multiplicity. But the multiplicity is at least $2$ at each point. Now suppose WLOG that $1$ is not in $M$. Consider the rational function $$f(z)=P\left(\frac{1}{1-z}\right).$$ The preimage of the unit circle under $1/(1-z)$ is a straight line $L$. And the set $|f(z)|^2=\mu^2$ is an algebraic curve $C$ of degree $2n$. The intersection $L\cap C$ may consist of at most $2n$ points, counting multiplicity. But the multiplicity of each point is at least $2$. This proves the statement. 

Nevanlinna theory is one of the main tools of study of holomorphic curves. It was originally developed in the attemts to better understand the nature of Picard's theorems. This is a very brief answer, and I recommend the book of Lang mentioned above, and his survey articles on holomorphic curves and diophantine geometry. For one-dimensional theory, which is extremelly rich and developed I recommend the books of Nevanlinna himself. They better explain the original motivations then the modern books. 

After you changed the sign to $(-1)^k)$, I want to point some literature related to the distribution of all zeros. It is MR2147385 and later papers which cite this. 

Yes. If the first divided difference has this property then the function is constant. As the $n$-th divided difference is the first divided difference of the $n-1$-st divided difference, we conclude that the $n-1$-st divided difference is constant. So your function is polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.
