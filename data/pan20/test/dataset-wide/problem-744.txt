I think it depends both on the rider (as @moz pointed out) and on the bike. And of course, you should have a clean road also. If you have a high end road bike in good shape, you can get to very high speeds if you've got the skills and the clear road ahead. In Tour de France downhill sections, they can go at speeds as high as 65 mph / 110 Km/h, even losing the motorbike reporters. As a counter-example, I had to brake at less than 30 mph / 45 Km/h on an old road bike, as the wheels were shaking due to bad balancing/tired axles/etc... On a side note, I think going over the cars legal limit is a very bad idea on open roads (this refers to the Tour de France-class of speeds). 

I can't speak for the Marathon or Marathon Plus, but I've got some puncture-resistant experience to share. We did a 400 km (250 miles) trip, over a dozen days, on various surfaces (more on that later) using Continental tires for the two bikes and Schwalbe Big Apple tires for the children trailer (Burley). And we're really glad we did replace the standard tire from both bikes and trailer as we didn't experience any flat, we didn't re-inflate any of the tires even once. Our trip was mostly hard dirt (maybe 60-65%), plus some asphalt or concrete (30-35%) and some gravel/sandy/other grounds. Overall, we didn't feel the tires to be heavy or anything like that, but we were heavily loaded anyway (trailer for me, rear bags for my companion), so it doesn't mean much. I can say I felt reduced drag from the trailer when we switched from the stock tires to the Schwalbe, as well as slightly smoother ride over gravel and lightly bumpy roads. Now for the puncture part... With my 'big' trailer, I had to make my bike go over lots of thorny stuff to avoid holes and rocks and other hazards on the track, the worst part during about 15-20 kms (9-13 miles). So both my bike's wheels plus the left wheel of the trailer went over lots of thorns, and probably the other bike some also (as she hadn't a two-wheeled trailer behind, she was more free to avoid thorns, holes, rocks, etc. than me). And I hit a lot of 'bad' stones, some of them quite sharp, but always at reduced speed (< 10 kph / 6.25 mph) to avoid sending the trailer flying. We didn't fully appreciate the puncture resistance before we met some other cyclists who just went over the same thorny/rocky/bumpy section as we did, and spent a lot of time fixing tires/tubes as all of them experienced punctures. So we're very happy with our tires. I'm not 100% sure of the actual model of the Continental, GatorSkin doesn't ring a bell and the tread doesn't look right. I think they're in fact this: Continental Travel Contact. There is also a 'City' model: Continental City Ride. Note: I picked the website in search results, not suggesting it at all, we bought our bikes and had them fitted with new tires in a local bike shop. Hope this helps :) 

Hang the bicycle upside down, on a stand if you have one, but you can also simply suspend it with a bit of rope. Next, you can easily clean the inside of the tube with a bottle cleaner dipped in solvent. Since the bike is upside down, there is no need to remove the cranks and BB. 

If you aim the high-pressure water jet at sensitive parts like bearings (BB, wheels, suspension, headset...) the water will get inside, and your bearings will rust and die. High-pressure water jets are also pretty good at filling your cable hoses with water, and getting past the seals on suspensions. So when using high pressure to clean a bike, stay clear of the sensitive bits, keep the nozzle like 2 feet away so it gets mist. However if you only aim it at the frame and chain, then no problem. High pressure is really good at getting the muck out of a chain, chainring, and cassette, but it also gets the grease out, so everything needs to be lubed afterwards. Just don't aim it up close to anything that contains a ball bearing or a seal. As a side note, if you don't want stuff to rust... Your chain and cogs are made of steel because steel is very strong and cheap. Stainless steel is weaker, a stainless chain wouldn't last. Steel rusts though, but it needs to be in contact with oxygen to rust. The oil on your chain forms a film which protects it from oxygen (and rusting). After a good MTB ride, your chain and transmission will be full of crap and if you rode in mud, the water will have removed some of the oil. So if you can't clean your bike straight away, a quick spray of oil will protect the transmission against rust. No need to overdo it, just a little bit of oil is enough. When you clean it, this also removes the oil, so spray a little bit of it. 

If it rains, yeah. From the last time I visited Toronto, definitely. Rack and pannier at the rear ; no backpack (makes you sweat). Lights (very important). For commuting what determines the average speed is : 1- choice of route (safe and slow or fast and dangerous, your choice, you must explore around to find a fast and safe route) 2- traffic lights In a typical city 20kph average is already very fast, you can't go much faster unless you burn all red lights and generally behave like a suicidal maniac. That's much faster than a car at rush hour, or a bus, though... 

...and when you swerve to avoid them, your wheel will hit the curb thoughtfully placed there by the designers, and you will crash. In this case, ride on the sidewalk on the left of the bike lane and give a wide berth to the bus stop. Yes it's illegal. Who cares. Always look out for the tiny stupid bits of curb that seem to grow out of the tarmac everywhere, if you take them at the wrong angle you will fly. Another reason why fat slick tyres are a nice thing for city riding. This is an example of a crossing where drivers crossing your path won't see you because of a brick wall. Thus you must think for them.
