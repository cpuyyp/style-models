Let's twist the question--how can you make a tech support job a more attractive long-term career path? What opportunities do you offer for career growth? Training? Do you have a path where someone can eventually take on more responsibilities? How do you foster the tech support community? Do you host meetups or participate in conventions? Or ... do you offer flexible work arrangements? Exceptional benefits? Work from home? There are plenty of people who are interested in jobs that offer security, decent wages and comfort. I've personally worked with people who were happy to bus tables in a casino until they retired. The casino offered decent wages and union protection--both very attractive if you don't have a easily marketable skill. You can find people in all the usual places IF the job has some redeeming qualities. It sounds like you're having trouble finding someone to take a job that doesn't offer much. 

To whom? Everyone. One person did you a favor, and let you know that your feedback was, for some reason, offensive to them. You have an opportunity to make sure your feedback is constructive and positive for everyone. You don't know who else has felt that way also, or may feel that way in the future. Find a voice and style That works for as many people as possible, including yourself. 

Only when you've obtained a signoff on the Change Request should you proceed. Try this article on for your next engagement. Look at a sample change request document 

While I can't speak to the origins of the terminology, it's motivation is apparent; Spending enough years at an endeavour, even with just a modicum of skill at it will result in ability that the skill alone would not confer. 

Generally, you're poorly positioned to increase your asking price if you don't have a cogent reason to. Look on the bright side: in a year or two, with a good performance on the job, you can negotiate a raise or at least change jobs. The salary you've negotiated now should just be a starting bar in your career, not the final destination. 

Are you some kind of load-bearing employee, In whose absence things will fall apart? Are you being singled out often to make such a sacrifice? Were you aware of X,Y and Z and your relevance therein, prior to scheduling your day off 

Depending on your relationship with your boss and your current track record, you should be able to directly approach your boss on the matter 

Another point to note is that no one likes to be called out in public. No one. I make it a point to can it until after team meetings to consult with my supervisor on glaring misconceptions he had during the meeting. I'm not saying watch everyone drive off a cliff but do not make someone or group of people out to look funny in public cold light of day. Ask questions that will hopefully lead to the discovery of the fact that you already know , instead of pointedly stating that everyone else is wrong. 

You are at a transition in your career. Have you considered want you want to do and where you want to work? If your current company meets those criteria, you can apply for a new position that matches your skill set, and negotiate a new salary accordingly. If you stay simply because you are already there, and/or you dig your heels in that you're being treated unfairly, you are likely undermining your own career. People will brag about a great new hire, even if the pay is a bit high. People rarely brag about giving more money to the person who was already there. This company has given you tremendous experience, and has increased your value as an employee substantially. If you shop that experience elsewhere, and it will be valued using the market in your area as a guide. 

For your real question--an interview is a two-way street. You are there to assess the mutual fit as much as they are. While I don't personally agree with this technique, and I wouldn't do it for my industry, there may be some value in their industry. Or, they may have just found themselves in that situation with that space, and didn't consider or prioritize this concern. Either way, it seems like they failed the interview. Move along. To answer your question in the post--no, I haven't had this situation, and I haven't interviewed people like this. But I have had an interview where the interviewer acted distracted, unconcerned, interrupted frequently and cut me off after 4-5 words of every answer. Eventually he stormed out of the room complaining. I guess I "passed" this test because he returned a few minutes later with a colleague saying this is exactly the type of discipline needed for a customer facing role. I asked some pointed questions about product quality, and now I understand why the customers get upset. So I "passed" again and moved along. There's a reason the job paid so well, and a reason people with that high salary were leaving the role. Consider yourself lucky, most bad employers don't advertise poor working conditions during an interview. 

As a result of the obvious fact that you cannot just demand leadership (that's an indictment of the current "leaders"), ask for the next best thing: Time. Time to become a leader of sorts yourself. As you've stated, given a reasonable amount of time, you can accomplish the task. Therefore, a lack of leadership, while demoralizing, does not necessarily hinder your success. Lay out a professional level of effort (LOE) estimation document that details the tasks and how long you'll require to execute each one. There'll be push back on the timelines but be prepared to defend your timings professionally, for each task. Ultimately, a compromise should result. Make sure your communication regarding the estimation is on record with emails, and that all stakeholders are in the know (in case they decide to be unreasonable about the timings and the project goes pear-shaped as a result). 

I wouldn't worry, if I were you. And I wouldn't make excuses for my results to an employer either. I'd pride myself in my body of work, years of experience and anything else I'd gotten right along the line. Any employer who's more interested in the number of assignments I turned in on time in university is probably not going to value my blood and sweat 

Clean up. The other interviewers may have uncovered something that the hiring manager wants more details on. The interviewers may have also received potentially contradictory information, and the hiring manager is looking to reconcile that. If the reviews were relatively positive, the hiring manager will want to do a bit of a sales job to reinforce how the company matches your goals. If the other reviews went poorly, well, sometimes you won't even see the hiring manager, who suddenly becomes "busy". 

Realistically, there will be challenges, and you probably already know them. If you address them head-on, they don't become problems. Some off the top of my head: 

Plant yourself where you can grow. If you're frustrated at the lack of talent, you're not happy, so you should look for somewhere you will be happy. I understand the generic responses that not everyone is superstar, but your post clearly indicates gross incompetence on their part. You'll learn more and enjoy your job more working in a shop with better people. True, not everyone will be great, and every place has a weakest link, but it's equally true that some places are on the bottom of the spectrum. Somebody, in fact, works for the lowest quality shop. It sounds like you're exploring that area. Get out now before your skills dull. 

You're not aware of whatever approvals, preparations have already gone towards carving out your price from the budget. You can't be sure that there is room for amendment after the necessary approvals have been granted for a previous figure. I'm not sure any hiring manager will want to jump through his corporation's red tape for such an increase. What is your bargaining chip? Certainly not your experience. On what grounds are you going to ask them to up the ante? You've in essence indicated how much you think you're worth by dropping a figure. What has changed between then and now to improve your market value to the prospective employer? It's your first gig. Unless you have a couple of other offers lined up, you're taking a risk by calling their bluff on this. Unless you have a niche set of skills (a mainframe programmer perhaps), they might not have any motivation to acquiesce your request. 

Standardization My last position before my current used to run a wild west type methodology. Everybody used the tools they wanted, what they were familiar with. What mattered was getting the projects delivered in good working condition and on time. It made for horrific code maintenance where one project would be developed with GWT as the presentation layer and JUnit solely for all kinds of unit testing and another developer stuck with raw JSPs while yet another brought JSF into the mix. Everyone was shackled to their projects and going on vacation was unthinkable for many and sounded the death knell for code reviews and optimization. I proposed we standardized on a number of industry standard technologies and tools that ensured that we all slept in the same direction of the bed (SoapUI for ws-testing, JSF for the web tier and with moderate success, Spring for back end processing and a couple of other stuff). And we all lived happily ever after. Discourage any individuality when it comes to tools of the trade that will create a files with a proprietary extension (or at least try to mitigate it); I If anyone has a favourite tool they trust their lives with, let them bring it before the court for evaluation and possibly team-wide adoption. You should've taken it upon yourself to set the standards with your tools. The benefits are obvious here, everybody used the same stuff with acceptable levels of comfort so with a decent design doc, anyone can pickup anybody else's bit and move on. Regular and compulsory code/project reviews This is another feature from my last gig. We all met once a week with our manager in a group session and discussed the status of each other's projects and raised concerns and challenges. We all, at a very high level had an idea of what the next guy was working on and sometimes would chip in advice and a couple of lines of code to help out. There was no total isolation Team Spirit I know it seems kind of trite and possibly a no-brainer, but healthy team spirit (and possibly a little competition) fosters information sharing. The downside to cubicle environment (especially team members in cubicles far apart) is that team members are often too far removed from each other's work lives that it's too easy to have a comms breakdown. There's better communication and information sharing when team mates are situated close to each other, preferrably in an open office environment with little in the way of walls or dividers. Discussions and mind-rubbing will happen and flow more freely, with them aim of fostering information sharing. Obviously Document. It's an old song. I won't sing it again
