The bolded part above is where the mistake enters your chain of reasoning. Matter is only a small part of the observable universe. We can also detect anything that has an effect on matter - any measurable effect whatsoever. These things we study in great depth, grouping them into types that we call 'forces'. We can see, study and comprehend a lot more of the universe when we include forces & energy, neither of which are 'matter'. Because of the hard work of scientists & natural philosophers over the past 300-odd years we now know that everything that affects us in our lives, from the chemical make-up of the food you eat and the air you breathe all the way up to the gigantic nuclear furnace in the sky that brings us heat and light each day, is based on only 4 fundamental forces*! This wasn't an assumption but rather a conclusion reached from hundreds of years of investigation by thousands of dedicated individuals. 

Simply speaking, no. If there are things out there that have absolutely no interaction with matter in any way, shape or form then it is indistinguishable from it not existing. This includes 'other' ways of knowing being invalidated as a means to detect them.** If there is no way to detect or know something, then it is out-of-reach of all human endeavour, not just science. Theories of spirit/consciousness, 'supernatural' entities, etc. all make the assumption that there's something nebulous out there... and that it can be perceived, manipulated or that this something can have an effect on our lives. Even if we can't pour 'spirit' into a glass, there are still predicted effects are open to scientific investigation! That consciousness is a fascinating, complex, emergent property of our biology is a conclusion, not an assumption, reached through many years of searching by many dedicated people. This is a triumph, not a shortcoming, of the scientific method. 

Your question has some good answers already, so I would just like to mention one more facet regarding the wrongness of belief. Isaac Asimov wrote a wonderful essay, titled The Relativity of Wrong, that you might want to take a look at. In short, even though everything we know may be wrong in some aspect, we can confidently state that we are less wrong today than we were yesterday, or 100 years ago, or 1000 years ago, etc. To take one of the examples used in Asimov's essay, what is the shape of the Earth? While the answer 'Flat' is a useful approximation for short distances (the curvature of the Earth is close enough to 0 that it was very hard to measure by early civilizations), we quickly run into big problems describing our planet this way. This is a qualitatively wrong answer. Answering 'Sphere' is a much better description, and our modern notions of navigation are firmly entrenched in the assumption of a spherical Earth. However, this answer is also wrong - at least in the sense of not being completely, absolutely, 100% correct. 'Oblate Spheroid' is a better answer again. Because the Earth rotates on its axis it bulges slightly at the equator compared to the poles. This is a much smaller correction than moving from 'Flat' to 'Sphere' - so is it fair to say that both answers are equally wrong? Is it not more fair to say that one answer is closer to the truth than the other? After all, even the 'Oblate Spheroid' answer isn't 100% accurate, either. The southern hemisphere happens to be slightly 'bulge-ier' than the northern one, so to be even more technically accurate you would have to describe our planet as being ever-so-slightly pear-shaped. The difference between our planet and a theoretical oblate spheroid is so small that it took very precise instruments on a specially-designed satellite to detect. So yes - everything we know will probably be shown to be wrong in some sense at some point in the future. HOWEVER, this does not mean that we will one day say 'The Earth is a cube'! Now going back to your core question: 

Until technology reaches the point where we can directly guide the reproduction process and make engineer changes or aesthetic improvements, the intent to have a child does not make the child 'designed' and ergo not an artifact. Intent to have a child or not, none of us have any control over the messy, biological processes of genetic recombination and development that leads to the birth of a new human being, but I can see this becoming an issue that could be revisited as technology marches on. 

As a side note, our research into quantum mechanics have shown that the foundation of the universe is probabilistic, not hard-deterministic. Sean Carroll wrote a wonderful 'Quantum Mechanics Made Easy' article that outlines some of the weird and wonderful implications of what quantum mechanics tells us about the way the universe operates and the implications how we, as observers, are entangled (in a quantum sense) with the things we observe. 

Your above 'shortcomings' were more ignorance of findings in specific scientific fields and/or a sense of unease brought by contemplation of the conclusions. Neither of which are bad, and neither are they shortcomings of science. Do you have any actual shortcomings in mind? 

Why should atheists bother debating theists? Short answer: Because a debate usually involves three parties, not just two: The proponent 'for', the proponent 'against', and - often most importantly - the audience. Longer answer: For the purposes of this answer, I am assuming that the question refers to some sort of structured (semi)formal debate, not just a casual conversation where each participant takes an opposing view. The latter is still valuable and has led to many deconversion stories, but lies outside the scope of this response. Additionally, in many of the atheist/theist debates the theistic position is represented by a theist who holds to some variant of a creationism viewpoint. While all the examples linked below involve creationist theists, the author feels this answer still applies if engaging with a different theistic viewpoint, such as deism. The particulars may be different, but the general benefits should still stand. Debates are a tricky thing, and on the surface would seem to be anathema to anyone who generally thinks scientifically. After all, science is about developing models and putting them out for rigorous testing, with reality as the final judge of whether the model accurately describes what it sets out to describe. It doesn't matter how popular, charismatic, elegant, sexy or comforting the idea is - theories are accepted as provisionally true so long as their predictive power holds, and refined, revised or replaced if new data brings the theory into question. In science, data trumps all. A debate, however, cares nothing for truth or even a reasonable facsimile thereof. Debates are won by scoring rhetorical points, not by being truthful or factual. In a live debate, there's not even time to fact-check your opponent's assertions - your rhetorical adversary could be confidently asserting one bold lie after another, and unless you're ready with snappy counters ahead of time each lie left unchallenged will look like a point in the other debater's favour1. If enough of the lies stand unchallenged at the end of the debate, Team Reason appears to have lost in the eyes of the layman and neither side will have changed the other's mind. So why on earth would anybody favouring science and reason as means for arriving at functionally true statements about the world ever use a debate format to present the scientific case for anything? When Christopher Hitchens debated William Dembski, he wasn't there to convince Dembski - he was there to present the case for science and reason to the young audience, and did a magnificent job doing so. When Bill Nye debated Ken Ham he went to raise awareness of science education in America, not to change Ken Ham's mind. Some debaters, like YouTuber Aron Ra, use an extended debate format as an educational tool. Websites dedicated to the issues, like the TalkOrigins Archive, turn the material generated by online debates into lasting educational resources. Additionally, by engaging with the best arguments that your rhetorical opponents can muster you can improve your own knowledge2 and strengthen your own position - or realize you harbour misconceptions/misinformation of your own, and strive to correct it. Even if the 'other side' seems unwilling to budge, as a debater on Team Reason make it clear that you're open to changing your mind if the evidence warrants... despite the fact that you probably consider the odds such evidence exists is infinitesimally low. Many of these debates take place in a wider societal context, and its the extended scope where these have their lasting value. Debate should not be the only tool in your kit, but done well a debate can be used to address issues such as science education and literacy, can expose people to views they might not normally encounter or consider, and can serve as an educational tool for yourself and for others. 

I would say that this argument from Thomas Aquinas was refuted, or at least made obsolete, starting with the 17th century with the work of Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton that gave us a better understanding of what motion is and why things move. Our understanding of motion has continued to improve, and there are many paths of objection. One of the quickest refutations of Aquinas's train of logic comes from our understanding of gravity. If you imagine the universe to be completely empty of everything save for two bodies with non-zero mass initially at rest with respect to each other, we know that these two bodies will exert a gravitational tug on each other. Each will cause the other to move towards their common centre of mass. Body A causes Body B to move, while simultaneously Body B causes Body A to move. Neither self-moving nor infinite regress required - motion is a fundamental property of the universe at inter-planetary scales, and it is rest that is unstable. We also now know that the natural state of the smaller things in nature nature is not to be at rest, but in motion. This seems weird to our macroscopic common-sense where we're constantly fighting against friction, but is a fundamental feature of our universe at the molecular level. So long as there exist temperatures above absolute zero there will be motion. Observing the Brownian motion of dust particles in a sunbeam on a contemplative summer day shows that complex macroscopic behaviour can emerge from this random molecular noise, too. 

Having ruled out the four known forces as possible carriers for an eternal soul, how about an as-yet undiscovered 5th force? Unfortunately, the 'fifth force' option won't work. We've looked. Any extra forces that may exist are far too wimpy to satisfy the third assumption. Quoting physicist Sean Carroll (emphasis added): 

1 Where a 'Smerg' is any arbitrary 'Something that might emerge rather than galaxies' in our thought-experiment universe. 

So: None, unless we deliberately send them into the future using some method of our own devising. Even then, without actual humans these values could rapidly evolve into something beyond recognition. 

In short: While we can use our languages to describe nature to the best of our abilities, we cannot use pure language study to derive new knowledge about nature (with the aforementioned trivial exceptions). 

The 'Pro-Life' angle to the debate on whether abortion should be legal is an attempt to re-frame the discussion to exclude one of the most important people under consideration: the biological mother. As demonstrated by your own charts, by putting up the smokescreen of 'Pro-Life' in your original question, the person whose uterus is being hijacked by a blastocyst magically disappears! Huzzah! Ethics is easy! ... Except, of course, to do that should be obviously unethical. That an adult human being has certain rights granted to them by society can't be dropped at the first sign of inconvenience. This isn't just about the rights of a clump of cells dividing in a vacuum - like many questions in ethics, it's about competing rights and how to navigate them. We treat an organ donation, like a heart or a kidney, with more respect than we do shed human cells such as from skin or from bodily fluids like saliva or blood. At the same time, it would be ludicrous to campaign that a harvested lung should have the right to vote or that improper refrigeration is exactly equal to murder. In short, a clump of cells that happen to be 100% certified living human tissue isn't necessarily granted the full rights and responsibilities of a member of society. Throughout the entire biological process that is pregnancy, the rights of the person carrying the proto-human should never be diminished or ignored. Any rights we choose to grant to the developing human may come into conflict with the already established rights of the pregnant person, and the study of cases where rights and values are in conflict with each other is what ethics is all about. The rights of the cells that may one day become an autonomous human being should approach - but never exceed - the rights of the adult. Now, one of the rights that we normally ascribe to our fellow human beings is that of bodily autonomy. This is why crimes which violate bodily autonomy, such as rape, are considered to be so bad. It is also why many would argue that mandatory blood or organ donation to save lives is generally considered unethical, even though the cost/benefit considerations would make mandatory blood donations a much bigger benefit to society than the minor, temporary inconvenience to its members. If bodily autonomy is something we hold as a virtue, then the pregnant person should have the right to choose whether to continue the pregnancy or to abort it. Outside agencies mandating that you must do one or must do the other would be a violation of bodily autonomy and thereby unethical, just as making blood donations mandatory would be unethical. Your charts grossly oversimplify the question and the underlying values at play. Life for the sake of life is not inherently valuable, even if the cells happen to have 46 human chromosomes. Here's a sample revised chart that is still oversimplified and probably irrelevant, but will hopefully be a little bit closer to where the discussion should be: (Forgive me, the site doesn't seem to let me make tables) (C): Humans have the right to bodily autonomy (c): Humans do NOT have the right to bodily autonomy (L): A pre-human has a right to develop regardless the cost to the host (l): A pre-human only has a right to develop only so long as the host is willing (C) + (L): Conflict in values - one will have to yield to the other. (C) + (l): Consistent consent - Bodily autonomy trumps and consent to be an incubator can be withdrawn at any time. (c) + (L): Fetal position - We don't have autonomy anyways, so we can make demands of people's bodies and expect them to comply regardless of the cost or desires of the person. (Complimentary cans of worms are there by the door) (c) + (l): Interference indifference - Do you believe that rights exist at all?
