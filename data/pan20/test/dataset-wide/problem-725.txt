It seems counter-intuitive, but these rounded heads actually hold a bolt very well. I can't recall ever having one slip (with the exceptions of already stripped bolts and/or user stupidity). As far as Park Tools go, they are well respected in the bicycle industry as offering the highest quality tools available. That's not to say they're the only game in town. There are lots of companies that offer high quality Allen wrenches. If you don't trust Park Tools for whatever reason, buy your Allen wrenches from any high quality source that you do trust. 

The hub is the body at the center of the wheel containing the axle. It is more or less just some bearings in a pair of cups that rotate around the axle. The freewheel is the mechanism that locks when pedaling forward (forcing the wheel to be driven by the chain) and spins freely when coasting or pedaling backward. Both wheels have hubs, but only the rear wheel has a freewheel. These are two variations on freewheel design, taken from the Wikipedia article linked above: 

NB: I'm not necessarily recommending this one in particular, just it or something like it. I have no experience with this particular model. I'm not sure if they make anything comparable for road setups. I wasn't able to find anything with a quick Googling. 

In addition to what others have said, many gas station air compressors won't push the tire pressure past 80 psi. This is fine for cars where the tires are usually inflated to about half that, but no good for a road bike where you probably want 100+ psi. This means that you're stuck using a floor pump, a frame pump, or a Co2 pump alll the time. And as others have mentioned, Prestas just work better with hand pumps. And if you're filling your tires to 100+ psi all the time, you might as well have a valve that works easily with the pump that you'll be using. 

I heard somewhere (I don't remember where) once that a seat post clamp should be oriented with the gap at the front of the seat tube, opposite of the gap in the top of the seat tube. The logic behind this was that it supposedly exerts more equal pressure around the entire seatpost. However, I've noticed that bikes off the rack are almost always sold the other way around, with the two gaps on top of each other. Does it really matter? Is one way better than the other? 

You actually guessed the only thing that you really need to watch out for: the BB shell width. And you don't even necessarily need that until you're actually putting it all together. Almost all BB shells are 68 or 73 mm. Most of the external BB's come built for a 73 mm shell and include a spacer for a 68 mm shell. The odds are really really good that the threads and diameter coform to the British I.S.O. standard. If you have reason to think that your bike is non-standard, I'd recommend taking it to a shop and they can tell you what you need. Unless your mountiain bike is a single speed, you don't need to worry about chainline. They're pretty standard and a derailleur adjustment will take care of any deviation from your current setup. If it is single speed, the BB isn't where you'll be looking to get that right. It's not like a cartridge-style BB where you can just get a different length spindle. Instead, you move the chain rings to the inner or outer side of the spider and/or mess with spacers in the rear wheel. 

In your particular case, it is most likely the tire pressure. Specifically, you are most likely over-inflated at 105 psi on a 28mm tire and closer to optimal pressure at the same psi on the 25mm tire (although it's possible that you're still over-inflating a bit since you're so light). An over-inflated tire will feel "bumpier" whereas a correctly inflated tire will sort of mold itself around the bumps in the road and feel less harsh. As always, Sheldon explains it better than all others. $URL$ 

If your old chain was 114 links (assuming it was the right size to begin with) then it's a good idea to take a couple of links out of it. It'll still work with two extra links but shifting may not be optimal and the chain will fall off more easily. Keep in mind that one chain link is composed of an inner and outer link, so a link is actually two pieces with a hinge in the center. This means that to remove two links, you'll actually remove four pieces of chain with three hinge points. If the old chain was 116 links and you're trying to replace it with a 114 link chain, you'll run into problems. A chain that is too short can jam when shifting and puts puts too much strain on your rear derailleur. To determine the correct length, wrap your chain around largest chain ring in the front and the largest rear sprocket, without running it through the derailleurs. Make sure that the chain is long enough for one full link (again, inner and outer) to overlap and you'll probably be spot on. You can read more about it here: $URL$ 

I can't tell what type of derailleur you have from the picture. However, generally speaking if you match up the type of bike (e.g., road vs. mountain), the number of gears, and the brand, you'll be fine. There's some flexibility sometimes, but it's easier to just stick with something that definitely matches. It's clearly a mountain bike derailleur, I'd guess that it's an 8 or 9-speed Shimano. If you can edit in a better picture, we could almost certainly figure out exactly what it is. 

Convert it to a single speed and slam the seatpost. Those will be the biggest things. Add a bash guard up front too for when your rear wheel falls off the teeter-totters and skinnies. A shorter stem would be a good addition too. It'll improve the steering for those technical sections. You might also consider a rigid fork. Suspension isn't really necessary for that type of stuff and can actually be a hindrance. That's why trials and bmx bikes have rigid forks. Surly makes a suspension corrected fork. Even with the correction, your front end will sit a bit lower than it does now, but you get used to it. You might want rim brakes too (if your bike is set up for either) for the same reason that you'll want a bash guard. You only have to land on a brake rotor once to really mess it up. You can true them to a certain degree, but they're never the same. If you stick with the disc brakes, you could try smaller wheels. 24" perhaps. But if you're going to go that far it's probably a better investment to just sell it (since you haven't been using it anyway) and buy a bike that's built for that type of riding. In fact, if you're going to be riding at this park more than once in a blue moon, you'd probably be happier doing that anyway. 

They come with bolts because QR's typcially don't clamp with enough force to keep the wheel from slipping forward. It looks like you have rear facing dropouts, so you should easily be able to use QR's if you get yourself a Surly Tuggnut. 

Yes, you can damage the frame if the seat post is too short. I have personally seen someone sit down on an overextended seatpost and fall off the bike as the seat post was wrenched out of the seat tube. The collar went flying and the top of his seat tube was mangled. His frame was titanium and he was able to bend it back. You probably wouldn't be able to salvage it with aluminum. In all likelihood, the minimum insertion line is at least somewhat higher than it needs to be in (courtesy of the lawyers). My gut tells me that it's fine as long as the seat post extends into the seat tube an inch or two past the top tube and seat stays. However, that is my gut. Don't take it as gospel. If in any doubt, buy a longer seat post. They're cheap. A frame is expensive. 

Headset The group of bearings and bearing cups that allows the steer tube to turn freely within the head tube. Headsets come in two basic varieties. Threaded headsets are common on older bikes and inexpensive bikes. They are called "threaded" headsets because the top race is held on with a threaded race and locknut. 

I read somewhere that when riding with a single pannier, the pannier should be mounted on the left side (traffic side in the US). However, the article didn't give a reason behind that. It's been quite some time and I can't find the article again for reference. I initially thought that it was so that the reflectors on the panniers wouldn't mislead motorists as to where on the road I, the cyclist, was positioned. However, after noticing this evening that a pannier mounted on the traffic side of the bike blocked the visibility of my girlfriend's seat post mounted light, I began to question this. Is there any reason to ride with the pannier on one side or the other? Does it matter it all? 

Any chainring that has the same bolt circle diameter (BCD) and the same number of bolts as your crank is compatible with your crank. The ever helpful Sheldon Brown has a page describing how to measure your BCD. The way you do it is dependent on how many bolts you have so I won't go into the details here. While a chainring may be compatible with your crank, there are other problems you can run into... Depending on your chain, you may or may not be able to use a chainring that was designed for a different chain, e.g., a 9-speed chainring with an 8-speed chain. Many people do this with success while many others have problems. It's probably easiest to just get one that you're sure matches. You also may have problems going bigger or smaller than your current chainring. Whether or not this is the case depends on your front derailleur and the width of your chainstays. Derailleurs have a minimum and maximum number of teeth they can accommodate. Check the specs on your derailleur to find out what these are. The chainstays are a bit more guesswork. Basically, the wider your chainstays, the smaller your biggest ring has to be. If you're dead set on a bigger ring, you can get a little wiggle room through spacers or a longer bottom bracket spindle but it's usually not enough to be worth the hassle.
