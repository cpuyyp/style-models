Tractor beam as used repeatedly in Star Trek. Pull the ship in close were you make some impromptu passages, or pull the ship into a cargo bay and lay siege. A tractor beam is simply a sci-fi version of grappling hooks. Grappling hooks were standard fare of pirates. 

Since the time frame is so large and the number of systems colonized is so vast, there are many ways that this species could become extinct. I imagine a scenario where on one of the planets an indigenous population is came across that is compatible for reproduction. The offspring produced would be essentially different from either of their parents. A new race essentially. Or the original indigenous population was able to adapt to the new tech that came along with the new population and over time reconquer their planet and move out into the rest of the universe from there. The new folks would be a more aggressive and capable people, and over some time would come to dominate the particular planet they were on. They would develop a Nazi like culture where they aggressively practiced genocide and conquest. Eventually taking this to the other systems from which there ancestors came. Over a long course of time they would conquer all. Since there are a thousand planets the precursors on each planet may have divergent courses of evolution and over time such a dark society could evolve into some kind of thing that was in essence not anything that resembled the original precursors, and then come to dominate with a practice of conquest and genocide. And lastly a species from another part of the cosmos that was bent on conquest and genocide could take over these worlds over the course of time. Your original precursors while intelligent could have something in their culture that made them highly pacifists. So they see the aggressive species coming, but the ethos are such that they will not rise up to defeat the invaders. And they have never developed complex weapon systems so even if they do rise, it is a futile gesture. They just hope that the invaders will stop at some point, but that never happens until they are all destroyed. The scenario does not have to be one of large fleets of starships invading planets, it could be a more peaceful scenario where over the course of time on each planet the new species just slowly dominates the precursors slowly overwhelming them until at one point it is decided the precursors are a drag on society and they need to be done away with completely. How they get there in the first place would be through trade and immigration or other fairly peaceful means. South Africa would be a good example, were the colonist dominated and essentially destroyed The cultures of the people whom occupied the land before they came. Take that another step to the dark side where apartheid never ends and slavery and genocide develop further, to a point were the whole country is only white. (Say Germany won the war so in western society genocide became more acceptable). 

There would be a second grade citizenship for somebody. My first reaction to the scenario is that unless it is an occasional aberration between two short lifers, the elf people are going to become the dominate species on the planet. It will go from humans liking the new elves, but as the elves become more prominent in society, the humans will start to become more biased toward them, because the elves represent a threat. And the elves will start to become more bias towards the human, considering them something less then an elf. Whatever it is that makes the elves live longer is in their genetics. Elves would tend to mate with elves since they would want their children to live as long as they did. Maybe not so much at first because there are not many elves to pick from and humans and elves still get along pretty good. However as time passed and more elves were around they would tend to mate with each other with more frequency. My rudimentary understanding of how cells work, is that cells contain a clock work of sorts and a mechanism that limits the number of times a cell splits. When the mechanisms fail, we develop cancer. Essentially the cells reproduce erratically and grow into tumors and such. The elves would simply have this cancer like quality to their cells, but instead of the cells growing into unhealthy body mass they would be healthy cells that kept the elves healthy, young looking and long living. The traits that made this possible would need to be passed on from elf to elf with reproduction. The elves would first segregate from the humans in small and large ways than they would dominate the humans and eventually the humans would become so marginalized that they would cease to exist as a society and eventually die out. It would be an evolutionary event, similar to others in human evolution were the once dominate humanoid just became a trace in our genes. Two things are very strong factors in the elves coming to dominate just by virtue of their long life spans, Acquisition of wealth and power, and reproduction. Humans will simply not have the time the elves do to do these things. When resources become scarce, and they well, the elves will win the day and eventually the world. Human kind will have evolved in to elves, and the short lived will be no more. Society would be very different then it is now. Marriage would be out, retirement would be different depending on the resources society has. It would be difficult for most of the people to acquire enough wealth to retire for a long period toward the ends of their lives. 

This is an institution that will dramatically change. It will not be idealized as the lifetime commitment that it is now. It will be some kind of commitment that is relatively short compared to ones life span. It may not exist at all. Elves will engage for a few decades to a one night stand to reproduce. How long they might stay a family would just depend. But certainly with youthful urges not many are going to last for the 4-500 year duration of life. It maybe something you do many times over the course of a life. With the number of children possible to have and the number of decedents possible to be living during your time family is going to take on whole new dimension's that may or may not be important to a elf. 

When it comes to ones enemies the main cause of generals loosing battles and countries loosing wars is a bad assessment that your enemies skills and advantages are perhaps not as they are. It happens every time a battle is lost. It is not only possible that someone disregards victories as flukes, are just good luck, and thinks someone's skills are mediocre comparatively speaking, It is a fact of every conflict that someone got this wrong. 

What I thought when seeing the question is the "High Castle" alternate reality were Germany and Japan prevailed in the second world war. I wouldn't think they would embrace the internet the way we know it today. They might very well develop the technology and use it on a limited basis for some military and business things, but for the average person the internet would be a mystery. Any planet that developed a society that leaned toward totalitarian would keep something like the Internet we know very limited. Wide spread open communication and totalitarian societies do not get along well. Ironically they would miss that great spying on the public tool that our current governments have taken full advantage of. (For our safety of course) 

Law is going to go through changes as the ratio between elves and human changes. At some point as the group of elves grows larger and the fear of them becomes more real, the laws against them will start to resemble the racial laws of the south, the Nuremberg laws of pre WWII Germany and other status against groups in other countries. This still will not stop the eventual outcome of the elves becoming the dominant humanoids on the planet. At some point the balance will tip in favor of the elves, and they will do about the same to the humans as the humans had done to them. This may not only be in legal matters it may be that this leads to war like conflicts at about the time the two powers are about equal. Still the elves will come out ahead, just because they can produce many more battle worthy citizens for soldiering then the humans can out of about the same size population. Any population that the elves loose during a war can be replaced much more robustly. Crime and punishment for elves will be much different from today. The main problem being is locking someone up for life. Can they afford to keep someone in prison for five hundred years? Or would this mean that rehabilitation takes on a new urgency and meaning. Term limits for judges and politicians would become the norm. 

The earth is pretty safe from solar flares because of the magnetic fields that deflect the event around the earth. However, the magnetic poles switch occasionally, like every 600,000 years or so. We really do not know what happens when they do switch. We do not know if the magnetic field shuts down then restarts at the new polarity, or how long it takes the switch to happen. So there could be a scenario were the magnetic poles are switching and the magnetic field shuts down for awhile, which would cause a catastrophic event on earth that would cause mass famine, break downs of society etc. it could take years to bring infrastructure back online. During this time human populations could decrease dramatically. I think the number people say that a sustainable number that could be supported after oil runs out is a billion people or less. During such an event oil would become very scarce, so farmers would not farm, and all those other things we depend on for day to day life, like Walmart would cease to function. Since we really do not know what happens, or even if we loose or magnetic shield when the polarity shift happens, you can be pretty liberal with your conjecture about this in your story. If we lost the magnetic shielding of the earth, every solar event rather massive or not would effect us. In essence we would be in the solar wind constantly. The earth becoming something that resembles the planet mars would be the worst case scenario. The death toll is completely variable. It could be one guy with a pace maker in Barrow Alaska falls dead in a large flare. It could be that the whole human race is wiped out if we lost our magnetic shielding that would change the planet so much that life would become unstainable. Some people believe that this is what happened on Mars. Apparently it may be possible that without a magnetic shield the solar wind scrapes the water off the surface of a planet after some time. It is also conjectured that when the poles flip polarity that nothing too huge horrible things will happen. So I made an assumption that you needed to validate with a little information about solar flares the death toll with some plausible context. Whatever death toll you want to use can work. It is really not how big the solar flare is, it is how big the flare is and how strong the magnetic field is that determines how much damage there is to the planet and all the things on it. So in your story line, just add the poles started flipping, and the magnetic field weakened to some point where x amount of damage happened and caused x amount of death. If your meaning is that you need to know how many healthy people standing outside could be zapped dead by the flare, the answer is zero. Unless of course the magnetic field turned off and they stood outside for a very long time, as the atmosphere was scraped away by the solar wind and they became more exposed to radiation and its deadly effects over time. (They were outside for so long because the were in line for the new I-Phone 973, which is the same as the IPhone-972 except it had new magnetic shielding and was three times the price, and new improved apps of course.) 

The emphasize would shift from end of life medicine to quality of life medicine. Research would be mostly in accessing risk factors and mitigating those factors. Smoking would be abolished. Other risky behavior would also be looked on as much more serious. You would after all be risking a life that has the potential to last five hundred years as fairly healthy, rather then a life of 70 years that starts to degrade health wise the older you get. People would eat better to make sure their heart and other vital organs do not give out prematurely. Many drugs like ibuprofen for example, that have long term health risks like kidney damage would not be allowed. The elves have solved the biggest medial problem we face today, the genetic barrier to a long life. They would now focus on the other things that end life prematurely. 

Lets say this guy gets past the first hurtles of surviving. Finds a place in a village where he can live a life, although a short life. I think this is perhaps the crux of the question, the guy arrives, settles in for a time, ponders what he could do to change the world with his advanced perspective. What could he possibly come up with, given the lack of resources and technology of the time he found himself in? The printing press is the thing. Easily built by a dedicated hobbyist that has been able to secure a few connections with a furniture maker, maybe a black smith and a supply of lead. To the basic machine, improvements would come later. We know it can be built at the time in question, because it was. Knowledge is power, but knowledge is useless if there is no medium for it. The most talked about thing in Western history is Martin Luther's thesis, and how everything changed in the religious world when he posted them on the door. Luther did not have an original concept on that door. John Calvin pretty much had said everything Luther posted a century before. I believe that it was about a half a century after Calvin's time that Guttenberg invented the printing press and the another five decades before Luther posted the thesis. During that time the printing press was catching on. Literacy rates were climbing, more people had access to printed material. In towns mass advertising was beginning to appear (Yes Spam!). All the things that helped Luther become the father of the reformation were in place. The reformation was the biggest, but by no means all that was going on. Knowledge was being recorded and much more widely distributed with each passing year. This spread has not stopped the Internet and SE being direct descendants of the Guttenberg printing press. It is said that the ancient Greeks were on the edge of an industrial revolution, but then the library burned, no back ups, no redundant storage, information was not widely known, most of it was lost. If they would of had a printing press, who knows we might be in the dark ages now having ran out of oil a couple of thousand years earlier. All the things that came after the printing press if not made possible by the printing press they certainly made more practical. Everything simply changed and became more accelerated as the flow and archiving of knowledge increased. The invention of the printing press marks the beginning of the modern era, without that acceleration in the archiving and dispersion of ideals, invention, communication etc., we would still be in the dark ages. The guy would likely die in obscurity, start ups at the time being pretty rough. That's one thing he could put together to change everything.
