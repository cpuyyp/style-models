Unless the company requests programming examples it is not necessary to provide a link to GitHub. You may not want to tell the company that you are applying to that you make a habit of posting on public sites IP owned by your current employer. The purpose of the resume is to get the interview. The purpose of the interview is to be able to discuss what you have done, and what you can do. So use the resume to tell us what you have done. Tells us what you were responsible for. The code on GitHub only tells me that you worked on a project that used this code. The first level of review of the resume may be by non-technical people looking for key terms. The people most able to review the linked code may only see the link ten minutes before you walk into the room. So unless they ask for a sample of code there is no real benefit to providing it. 

It can't hurt to bring it a copy of your references or their contact information. Somebody might ask for it, and instead of saying I will get back to you, you will be able to give it to them right away. I have also run into the situation where they want me to fill out a "application" before I leave, even though they have my resume, and I have completed forms online. Having the copy of the reference makes it easy to fill in that section of the application. I always bring extra copies of my resume. You never know when somebody might not have one, or when the system they use for interviews produces a unusable one. I also bring questions I want to ask, and notebook and pen to make notes. 

You realize that when you told them what you wanted in terms of salary they expected that it would be enough. You are now in a difficult spot because you now want more. If you are going to ask for more they will want to know why? You might be able to convince them that their benefits aren't as good as you expected, or the commute will be more expensive, but they don't have to change their offer. Imagine the following scenario. The jobs with that title pay 40K to 50K. They asked how much you wanted you said 45K. They were pleased to hear that number. It is in the middle of the range, it saves them some money, and gives them room to give you a raise next year. Therefore your application moves to the next round of the hiring process. Now you tell them the truth, you want 55K. There is now an issue. They can't meet your request, it is more than they can pay somebody in that position. But even if they offered you the top of the scale (50K) they don't have room to give you a raise next year. Employees never want to be at the top of the scale, it reduces the chances of a raise. Employers don't want employees at the top of scale, because they aren't motivated. They now worry that they have wasted their time regarding your application and offer, you were never a serious candidate. They also worry that even if you accept either the current offer, or their improved offer, you will be unhappy, and not be with the company for very long. It comes down to how much are you willing to risk. You can accept the current offer, and don't plan on staying for very long. Or you can try and ask for a better deal, and realize they now are concerned about you. You might or might not get it. Or they can reject your bid for a better deal and never hire you. If the question describes the situation accurately, you aren't being greedy. You just did a poor job of answering their question. 

We can't help you decide when you should quit, or if you should stick it out. We can't help you decide if an offer from the founder will make your situation better. But the general advice is don't quit until you have another job. You state in a comment that that implies there are no other contractual or legal reasons that would require a longer notice period. For somebody who feels that the work suffers because they don't like their job, and that you are concerned about giving what may mean months of notice. So if you decide you have to leave: start looking and when you find the job you want, then tell your current employer. There is no need to give more notice than is required. The traditional two weeks notice is only to allow you to finish up some tasks, document where you are, and to provide some training to somebody already with the company. It was never expected that two week was enough time for the company to advertise for a replacement, conduct interviews, pick a candidate, do a background check, and get them on board so you can train them. If they felt they needed more time for transition, or they could require more transition they would have included that in a contract. 

If people from your current company will be at that meeting, or people who could talk to your current company will be at that meeting. You need to be extra careful, otherwise you will be telling your current company that you are on the way out the door, before you even had an interview. If this will be a one-on-one meeting, you will be able to talk to them a little easier. But you will have to decide if telling them does actually give you an unfair advantage. Keep in mind that other candidates might also have a relationship with the new company or could have even be recommended by employees with the new company. It will also depend on how confident you are in the possibility that they will be the one making that decision. You question implies that your aren't 100% certain. So plan what you are going to say, because they could react in a number of ways: have no idea what your are talking about; deny their involvement; talk about the position and process; misunderstand and then ask their company to request a new contact because you are leaving.
