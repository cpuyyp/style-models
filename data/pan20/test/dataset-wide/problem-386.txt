Have the process be very slow. The scanning can only proceed so quickly, and so the teleportation takes a few minutes. During the scanning process, part of your body has already been reconstructed at the destination, and part is still at the original location. Now, the body is something that is permanently in flux, with blood and lymph and saliva moving at all times. Something needs to be done about this. Therefore, anything that crosses the current scan location is immediately reproduced on the other side. This includes any ions that are released by neurons in the brain. When done in this manner, there will be a noticeable period of time during which your brain is divided in two. Half the brain at the departure station, and half at the destination. The two halves communicate with each other, with the division being mediated by the equipment itself. Imagine your left eye receiving input at the destination, while your right eye has yet to be transferred. You are conscious of both portions simultaneously, and feel both of them to be "you". With this, it becomes much easier to convince people. You have regained "continuity of self", which solves most of the philosophical issues. Heck, I could even imagine a travel agency branding itself "Ship of Theseus", to draw attention to the way all of their competitors require destruction of self at some point. Sure your original body is completely disintegrated, but you have observed your new body being made with you in it. 

This system has a few problems of its own however. Inheritance becomes a bit messy; based on the above system, a type 1 and a type 4 could have either type 1 or type 4 children, but a type 1 and a type 3 would always have type 5 children, and a type 5 and a type 6 could have either type 3, type 4, type 5, or type 6 children. Also, it's difficult to justify why one particular combination would be non-magical but all other combinations were of equal strength. We can't just make allele C nonfunctional, because then there'd be no difference between types 1 and 5 and between types 2 and 6. You could get around this by making allele C be unable to function on its own, making type 3 non-magical, but to change the effect of allele A or B if its also present. This is perfectly biologically valid, but it still ties types 1 and 5 and types 2 and together somewhat. So this is now getting into the realm of exactly what these types of magic are, how they relate to each other and what common features they might have. An alternative explanation could be that two of the alleles, say A and B, have "opposite" effects that cancel each other out. Maybe the A and B enzymes recognize each other as foreign and try to consume each other, but don't mind themselves (obviously) and are okay with enzyme C. Or maybe the molecules they produce destructively react together (imagine if A gives you magic through the power of baking soda, C through the power of water, and B through the power of vinegar. Stupid example but hopefully it makes my point). This would be very similar to how blood type works, as discussed in John's answer. It doesn't have to be one gene, however. There could be two genes essential for magic, or three, or six. There are many increasingly complex ways this could work. I'll write more if I think of any that are particularly interesting. 

Because you yourself are part of the simulation. In order to maximize happiness, it must simulate the result of each possible output that it can produce. One of those possible outputs is the command to destroy the machine, which must be tested within a simulated world. Within that simulated world, there is a simulated person, reading the results of the simulated machine, which outputs "destroy the machine". This simulated person is you. After many years, once the machine deems your universe not worse continuing, then it will end abruptly. Try not to worry about it. 

Because there is value in free will, and value in uncertainty. The machine, complicated as it is, is clearly an automaton. Any person who follows the machine's advice perfectly, is also an automaton. It becomes questionable whether the person is indeed a person, or whether they are merely a self-propelled extension of the machine. Maximizing the happiness of people would necessitate preventing people from entering this state of dependence. Note that this is not my original idea, but is explored more fully in this short story. $URL$ 

Perhaps the engines and the guns are a single device. Both are designed to propel a small amount of material away from the ship as fast as possible. The only difference is that in one case you point it at the enemy, and in the other, you point it behind you. This would have an interesting effect on tactics and formations. You would need to plan your approach route such that no other ships pass through your exhaust. A ship can easily retreat while firing, and has difficulty advancing while firing. In order to do so, ships could build up momentum, whip around, then fire at opponents while coasting forward. 

Consider the hormone Norepinephrine. On Earth, this chemical is produced by as part of the "fight-or-flight" response, that is, when an animal is panicking, anxious, or generally high strung. If your creature evolved separately, it might have a completely different use for the molecule. Instead of making the creature anxious, maybe it acts like an enjoyable drug, or maybe it serves as an essential micronutrient, like a vitamin. It could even be an aphrodisiac. Regardless, it's a chemical your creatures want. In order to actually get the Norepinephrine, the creature would have to induce great stress in a person (most easily by scaring them) and then extract the Norepinephrine from their bodies. They could act like leeches, secreting an anesthetic from their jaws and silently filtering it from the bloodstream, or they could violently rip out the person's adrenal glands (where the hormone is produced)--whatever's to your story's best interests. Unfortunately, it's not scientifically plausible for them to feed* off of the actual emotional state of fear, since that feeling is quite literally all in your head. It would have to be a chemical mechanism. Going straight for the hormone seems like your best bet, although there is some tentative evidence that emotional signals can be chemically imprinted in human sweat. *For commonly accepted definitions of "feed". 

Perhaps the villagers are intentionally excluded, in order to see what technology they will invent. If the higher beings give tech to the villagers, then the villagers will progress along the same path as the higher beings did. On the other hand, by letting them struggle on their own, it may result in different discoveries than had happened in the higher beings' development. This is not without historical precedent. China produced far better pottery/porcelain than Europe, and therefore had no need to develop better glass. Europe relied on glass instead, and so there was a supply of people who knew how to work glass. This meant that refractive lenses could be developed, and microscopes/telescopes could be invented. 

Unlike a person, an AI can be transferred to a new body without issue. An AI can be copied, modified, beamed to another planet, lie dormant on a hard drive for millennia, and so on. In this case, what does it mean for an AI to "die"? The ship that contains the AI may be scuttled, but so long as the AI's data is sent out before the ship is lost, the AI can be started up again on new hardware. Even if the hardware is lost entirely, the AI can be started from a previous backup, which would be equivalent to having a short period of amnesia. So, what forms of death remain, that an AI might suffer for? The only ones remaining are psychological, where the AI realizes that it cannot continue as it is, and turns itself off. Restarting another copy of the AI would just result in the same problem. Even if a trained reverse engineer could remove the psychosis, it may require such fundamental changes that the AI is no longer the same person. Restoring from an old backup might work, but the AI may develop the same psychological problems over time. I propose that a grave of an AI be a copy of it, taken just prior to turning itself off. Visitors can activate the AI, and converse with it for a short amount of time. However, the underlying psychological issues still affect it, and so the AI must be reset to its saved state frequently. These AI are like ghosts: good to talk to, and to get advice from, but not good for long companionship. 

Well, space is big, there's certainly room for it. But the system you're describing seems incredibly dense. I'd be very surprised to find that much matter packed into one system outside of the galactic core. 

DNA is fundamentally a discrete structure (a finite sequence built from a finite alphabet), so at a genetic level, all traits are discrete. However, there may be so many genes involved that there are many, many possible phenotypes, making the trait appear continuous. Also environmental factors like nutrition and sun exposure may play a role in traits such as height and skin color. But at the enzymatic level, all traits are discrete, and since inherent magic probably falls outside the realm of environmental effects, I'm going to assume that having a particularly magic type has a direct correspondence to enzyme activity. The tricky part is coming up with a set of enzymes and enzyme variants with exactly 6 phenotypes. The biggest obstacle to overcome is avoiding the effect of codominance. Perhaps the most obvious solution is to have a single gene with 6 alleles--but remember that humans are diploid and thus, everyone has two copies of every gene. Since every allele corresponds directly a magic type, and every person has two alleles, we wind up with 21 total phenotypes. We can get around this in a couple of ways. We could put the gene on the X chromosome. Males have only one copy and females only express one copy. But this has the effect that males always inherit their magic type from their mother, while females could wind up with either their mother's or their father's type with about equal likelihood. Alternatively, we could reduce the number of alleles to 3, which would result in 6 phenotypes. Each magic type is now the result of the combination of two alleles. For example: 

Burial Practices The fire people practice funerary cannibalism, and are therefore susceptible to Kuru, a slow disease that is transmitted by consumption of the brain. The Fire nation believes that, just as all fire proceeds from fire, so all life proceeds from life. When somebody dies, their fire goes out, just as an untended flame will wither and die. But, just as two flames brought together will burn as one, so two people, brought together into the same body, will burn together. After a person's flame has gone out, but before the embers have died down, the community gathers to honor them. Each person eats part of the deceased, taking their flame. This way, so long as the community survives, the flames of the ancestors will never go out. The Earth people believe that life proceeds from the ground, and returns to the ground to grow again. This is seen in the daily cycle of eating meals from the ground, followed by defecation into the ground. It is also seen in the cycle of a life, where each child learns first to walk, then to run, but will eventually return to the ground. When an Earth person dies, they are buried, that the strength that they borrowed from the earth may rest, and return to strengthen future generations.
