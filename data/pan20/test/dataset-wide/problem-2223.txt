What does it mean to be under monitoring? Can I drink coffee before competitions under WADA's supervision or use synephere stimulants? 

Aggression spread aggression. It is easy just to follow the other player and bang harder back. You need to outsmart the other player somehow particularly if you are about the same level or you feel you may not last long enough in the tempo. What kind of strategies have you used to outsmart an aggressive tennis player?

Yes, prolong the time on the contact point during the follow-through. Follow-through is a repeating thing in ball games. Keeping your eyes on the contact point in the follow-through helps to keep you focused and determined during the shot, avoiding mistakes due to hesitance such as forgetting to look at the ball and looking too early to the target.

Many asthmatic medications such as pseudoefedrine (in DUACT) and different inhalers are performance-enhancing-performance drugs. I have heard cases where athletes have forgotten to inform officials that they need to use certain drugs and false alerts about doping positivity. So How do competitive runners with asthma handle doping tests? 

My friend suggest me non-interlacing progressive mode to my Sony Nex-3N with low shutter speed and a lot of light and one camera photographing the player and one camera photographing the ball. Is there any ready made device to get the speed of tennis ball without manually calculating it from the pictures?

Spin is highly important in professional ball games such as tennis, football (soccer) and basketball. In order to shoot with spin in tennis, you need to have enough flexible hands/arms and learn the proper technique. Spin also helps to score in basketball because side-spinned balls turn more easily to the goal. In football (soccer), spinned shots are highly unpredictable for the goalkeeper and defence, making scoring more probable with the surprise element. Golf balls can travel father away due to spin. Spins are everywhere and its understanding can be a real advantage! The importance of spin in ball games make me wonder whether spin is also used in ice hockey or could it be used? I feel topspin and backspin are very rare in hockey. So

My friend Timo mentioned that GoPro Hero 3 can connect to your phone with some lag. This opens me an opportunity to get immediate feedback about my tennis serving with topspin. I want to train serving with topspin and I would like to see how the shot looks from the side. Basically, attach the camera to the net and look the shot with your phone/monitor (probably in the future in Google glasses or something like that). Little lag does not matter here, it just need to be fast enough not to be irritating. I currently use the iPhone 5 camera for the analysis but hard to see the ball's path and very slow method. 

where you see back pointing towards the side, bad. In comparison Federer 1m12s gets the momentum towards the field. 

This video (8min53s) mentions that eyes are always at the contact point even during the follow-through, I understand this so that the video generalises the observation to all ball games. I instructed my friend in golf to follow the ball during his shot and his shot seemed to become better but this instruction to follow the contact point during the follow-though. So 

I want to improve my forehand near the net. I hit ball to a wall with a specific target but the rebound is so fast that it is not really equivalent to high ball shots. How do you train forehand near the net? Example 

I have tried to understand this shot now years later through golf-tennis terminology. The ball changed direction two times so it must have had: 

The skin can get broken. The skin can get too dry and then broken. Blisters may develop with certain shoes. Pain in tibial tendon may be more regular with fore-foot training. Pain in knees may be more regular with with middle-foot training or back-foot training. If you have too much weight, it may be better to train more in swimming pool rather than on tracks to avoid injuries in bones and muscles. What are ways you manage wear as a long-distance runner? How have you planned your life-style and training to avoid injuries? 

This should be a goal as pointed out by Ale due to the player 2 (red in Ale's picture). The referee did not probably see the player 2. The referee's decision not a goal probably relies on the part 3 of offside rule if player(s) offside at the point of the crossing shot. Otherwise I would count this as a regular goal but the lineman's flag means that there must have been a player(s) in offside position before the crossing shot. The point 3 of the Wikipedia link above is bolded below 

I am analysing the serving here where the player gets angular momentum not towards the field but to the side. 

Rumoured that not all Powerlifting federations are under WADA that means that they do not comply with anti-doping policies. So some competitions allow the usage of dopings while others not. So Which powerlifiting competions comply with WADA's anti-doping policies? 

The Babolat advertising here mentions the durability with players such as Rafael Nadal. According to google, durability means "the ability to withstand wear, pressure, or damage". I am not sure what it means here: it does not certainly mean too muscular because muscle is very expensive cell in terms of natural metabolism rate aka energy needed per time unit. Too muscular person cannot continue playing because of getting tired during a long run so not durable. Now I am trying to make the connection to durability and monofilament strings. What do the two things have to do with each other? I cannot see the connection. Please, explain: 

I want to try the longest possible tennis racket meaning 29 inches long, USTA rules. I use Babolat Pure Drive (68.5cm long) but I want to get it 5.2cm longer to be able to hit as high as possible in servings. I am not sure whether it makes any sense to try to get as long tennis racket as possible by that I try to add the maximum power to servings so personal height has less importance. Is it possible to lengthen an existing tennis racket or some other options to get the longest possible tennis racket?

I need to find international rules on how arms should be located during benchpress in Powerlifting competition. So Which rules govern hands on bar during benchpress in Powerlifting competition? 

My tennis couch said that I should test as many overgrips as possible to find a grip which does not get slippery so fast and maintain the condition for a longer period. I tested Gamma overgrip that got slippery very fast and I had to change it after four training periods. Before that I had Wilson but in different racket so I am unsure about their differences. I am not sure whether finding the overgrip is the key here, it may be that a poor undergrip makes the grip go worse faster. I use overgrip because of the larger handle and it helps to keep the racket not sliding easily out of my hand. 

The wordrecord news meantions that IPF to be the only Powerlifting federation that complies with WADA's anti-doping policies: 

My fellow sailor said that an ideal sailing boat should turn against the direction of waves when losing control. Then he said that ice sailing boats cannot do this. This is apparently because ice sailing boats do not have a keel. Now How/why does the ideal sailing boat stop when losing control? Why is this not possible with ice sailing boat without keel? 

The fastest recorded tennis serve is about 260km/h but smash is far easier to do and shoot with far higher velocity. I am trying to find the maximum speed tennis players are able to shoot the ball and I feel the shot is smash, not serving. Correct me please if I am wrong. So what is the fastest recorded tennis smash?

P.s. the picture is a little bit misleading but when I press the ruler to my hand: the distance from the top of my ring finger to the second crease is 12cm. 

where notice the part 1 and 6. If you are looking for a bar, make sure that they comply with the rules -- recretional bars can fail in the weights, knurling and quality. 

where any change in the elected lifting position would cause Yellow card. Powerlifting has three cards: red, blue and yellow that can be used to claim a failure, more an page 8-9. The rules governs the bar and knurling distances as well, more on page 5 

stiff shoulder cuff that requires shoulder cuff trainings like here hunched S-shaped back requires booty training like here explosive serving requires explosive squats like here where you use as many leg muscles as possible: use hypothrophy/power training using the glycogen energy reserves for the first serving while the second serving can be done with different technique with less power 

My grip size is 12cm 4 6/8 and I have a racket 4 3/8 with overgrip i.e. 4 4/8. It is not fit enough and getting some pain with it. I want to increase its size by 1/8 inches but which kind of Heat-shrink sleeve should I use? Can I buy it from any warehouse store or does it need to be tennis-specific? What kind of features are required from the heat-shrink sleeve? 

I played my first serious match against a player in tennis who strikes over 200km/h. I got a little feeling of pain to my elbow when I passed balls back with a little angle in the elbow. Later I changed my elbow to totally direct the point when I hit the ball so I experienced no pain anymore. I asked my experienced friend about this pain and he said that the pain may be due to poor technique and I should still continue with my old angular forehand strike and improve swing of the whole body. I am uncertain about this so:
