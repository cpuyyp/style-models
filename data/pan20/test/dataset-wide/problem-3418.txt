If it was not feasible, then the residents of the city would bid up the price of the services provided by the low-paying jobs until the induced rise in wages (and the fall in rents) would make housing affordable enough for people who are supposed to provide the "make the world go round" services. It's important to note that this process can't create housing units out of nothing; so the restricted supply of housing still leads to inefficiency - if no new houses are constructed, people who are dissatisfied with the lack of affordable basic services have to move out of the city until enough housing is freed up for workers who are going to provide these services. This leads to inefficient allocation of labor, etc etc. "Labor market corrections" or rent regulation don't solve the underlying problem, which is a shortage of housing units in areas which offer higher productivity to workers. Public transit could help, but how exactly do we make it "high quality"? The best way to improve the quality of public transit is probably to build more roads to alleviate traffic problems during peak times, and these construction projects usually run into the same barriers that housing construction projects do. The solution I would recommend is to reform some of the environmental regulation, zoning laws and the government's internal review processes which make it so hard to build new housing units, high-speed trains, roads, etc. If the problem is a lack of housing and transportation infrastructure, the correct response should be to remove the supply-side barriers which are contributing to the shortage. 

The effects can be quite different from a price (wage) ceiling. The baseline case where you have homogeneous, inelastically supplied labor that's free to move across different "types" of work produces no supply response in reaction to a wage ceiling, but leads to complete specialization in one type of labor or another in the case of enforced bounds on relative wages which rule out the competitive market allocation. For companies, enforcing internal wage ceilings may be a way of trying to address problems of corporate governance - the shareholders may be trying to address a principal-agent problem by getting such a policy instituted within the company. In that case, it may well improve efficiency, but it's hard to say if there would be a significant impact on the supply of executives available for corporate management. 

Yes, the diagram represented in the question is correct. Assuming imperfect capital mobility (with the BP curve steeper than the LM curve), an increase in G will: 

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare answered in the upper house to a question that India has a fertility rate of 2.2 (link here). The replacement fertility level is usually given at 2.1 to 2.2. These sources suggest that India's population is projected to grow at least until 2060 (2050 in some sources): Quartz, The Hindu. The Quartz article even cits UN population projects and says: "Even under the instant-replacement fertility variant, with the country’s fertility assumed to fall immediately to 2.1 births per woman, India’s population would reach 1.9 billion by the century’s close." This source defines the replacement fertility level as: "Replacement level fertility is the level of fertility at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next. In developed countries, replacement level fertility can be taken as requiring an average of 2.1 children per woman." What I don't understand is: how can India's population be projected to grow until 2060 if it has already reached replacement fertility level in 2017? A 'generation' is usually 25 years. Even if we take it as 30 years, India's population should stop growing in a couple of decades. How does the UN project that it'll grow until 2060? 

I'm currently learning the Mundell Fleming model, and so from my textbook and other sources I've figured out the effect of increase in money supply and government expenditure increase for the following conditions: 

Fixed & floating exchange rates (perfect capital mobility / BP horizontal) Fixed & floating exchange rates (imperfect capital mobility, BP flatter than LM curve) Fixed exchange rate (imperfect capital mobility, BP steeper than LM curve) 

Recently in a test I was asked to describe the modified IS-LM framework. I assumed I was being asked the IS-LM-BP model, since it modifies the traditional IS LM model by adding a BP curve. I looked up on a couple of references (Macroeconomics by Dornbusch, and Macroeconomics by Olivier Blanchard) but they have no reference to it. Looking the term up on a search engine only throws results about papers that suggest a modification to the IS LM model. What exactly is a modified IS-LM framework? 

In general, "Ponzi schemes" in the context of asset pricing refer to "rational bubbles", or a failure of the transversality condition you need when passing from a flow identity to a present value identity. They are not "fraudulent schemes". For instance, there can be a rational bubble on a "fundamentally" worthless asset in a perfect foresight world if its price grows at the real interest rate available in the broader economy. (This is actually what you're talking about, in case it's not clear to you - each investor assumes they can offload the asset at a higher price to another investor, and you push the problem of the "greatest fool" to infinity, which makes the assumption a rational one ex post.) Is there any evidence for the existence of such rational bubbles? Cochrane (2002) points out that rational bubble theory does not account for the association of "bubbles" with high trading volume. In a rational bubble, it is rational to hold the asset in every period: there's no reason to observe high turnover along with high prices. They are also silent on the association of high prices with high volatility - in a rational bubble context, volatility (induced by shifting from one equilibrium to another) is always present, and the choice of equilibrium (the fact that we're on an explosive price path) does not produce more volatility than usual. Rational bubbles appear to be a poor explanation of events that people have historically described as "bubbles" (and of the price behavior of cryptocurrencies). In contrast, the convenience yield theory outlined in Cochrane (2002) and also in this blog post seems to fit the data much better. If "overvaluation" is driven by a liquidity premium induced by shorting constraints and a short-term constraint on supply, then we would expect to see the standard prediction of monetary economics that high prices should be associated with high turnover. In that case, overvaluation relative to "fundamentals" should also require shorting constraints - in the case of dollars vs treasuries, for instance, it's illegal to print banknotes or close substitutes to money to finance a purchase of bonds, which is a kind of shorting constraint. Indeed, shorting constraints are what we see in the cryptocurrency market: BTC futures have only recently started trading on stock exchanges, and even then the "electronic paper" that you hold when you take the long side of a BTC futures contract is not the same thing as holding BTC directly, so what appears like a possibility to short BTC through these contracts is in fact not so. (It satisfies "speculative demand", so it's possible to "bet on cryptocurrencies" without having to hold any, but it's not possible to use these contracts in the place of cryptocurrencies in transactions.) If you want to ask whether cryptocurrencies are a bubble, then you have to define what "bubble" means. If it is "overvaluation relative to fundamentals", then is USD a bubble? After all, it's trading at a premium relative to T-bills. If you include any convenience yield the asset may have in your definition of "bubble" so that USD is not one, then it's likely that cryptocurrencies are not "bubbles" either. It's very difficult to say anything about whether cryptocurrency valuations are "justified" or not by this explanation, since the convenience demand of cryptocurrencies, like of cash, has components which are not transparent. We're mostly in the dark, and I wouldn't try to outguess the market price of an asset in a circumstance where we know next to nothing about the factors which are driving the convenience demand for it. 

Does existing research show, for example, that if A & B relax labour mobility norms, poverty in both these countries reduces? Do note that I'm not talking about domestic labour mobility. 

Let's say that I buy an app from the Play store. The seller quotes in Dollars, and I pay in Rupees (INR) --how does this transaction happen? Is my ₹ converted into $? Does this transaction also influence the forex markets (of course, negligibly --I'm only asking for understanding's sake). If I have to purchase a physical good while in the US, I'd have to convert my domestic currency into dollars and that'd push the dollar prices up since there is demand for more dollars. Does the same happen when I'm at a different country and purchase a good in dollars? 

If not, what type of trade financing do Chilean exporters or importers get? Is it all from private banks and insurers? 

GDP = Consumption + Government Expenditure + Investment + Exports - Imports My cases are: (1) If the employee is getting paid for his extra-work, his consumption would increase. (2) This employee might take away the job of someone else --and thus his increase in spending could get nullified By definition, GDP = the total value of all goods and services produced. (1) If even after working overtime, the company produces the same amount of goods / service --by definition, GDP hasn't risen at all. 

Move the IS curve to the right. At this point (B), there will be a BOP deficit because the point is below the BP curve. Thus, the domestic currency will depreciate. Exports will rise, imports will decrease and thus net exports will rise. This will have two effects: (a) this will shift the IS curve further to the right (because net exports have risen, and so Y has risen) and (b) this will shift the BP curve to the right (because net exports have risen, improving the current account balance). The new equilibrium is at C. 

Falling oil prices may or may not lead to a lower price level depending on how you're measuring the price level and what measure of inflation the monetary authority is trying to target. Is the relevant inflation figure the GDP deflator? The PCE deflator? The CPI? The "core" CPI? Ignoring any nominal effects of falling oil prices if they exist at all, the mantra here is "never reason from a price change". Why is the price of oil falling? Is it because we've invented a new technology which allows us to synthesize oil at low cost, or is it because there was a recession in China which is leading to lower global demand? In the latter case, clearly the experience of the US and of China would be different. There's also the fact that higher productivity of the kind that would be caused by a new technology allowing easier production of oil may not necessarily translate into higher employment. In general, there are competing income and substitution effects in these situations - as you become wealthier you want to work less, but as wages are higher you want to work more. It's not clear a priori which effect would dominate. Finally, "unemployment" as used in "natural rate of unemployment" is meant to be a proxy for output gaps - if unemployment is higher than the "natural rate", then there's a negative output gap, and vice versa. In down-to-earth terms, we define "unemployment" as the state of not working but actively looking for a job, and the unemployment rate is the ratio of the number of such people to the size of the labor force. A change in the employment rate (the employment-to-population or employment-to-working age persons ratio) need not have any effect on the unemployment rate. Unemployment in a time of negligible output gaps is mostly the result of search frictions in the labor market. If a technological development made it easier to match potential employees with employers we would expect the "natural rate of unemployment" to fall, but it's not clear if or how an oil price change would lead to such an outcome. 

I wanted to verify the relationship between inflation and unemployment empirically, so I took data from the World Bank and used excel to correlate them. I got a very, very bad correlation between unemployment and inflation (from 1991 to 2016). Am I doing something wrong here? I took these two sets of indicators: (1) Unemployment, total (modeled ILO estimate) and (2) Inflation, consumer prices. Here are the links: $URL$ and $URL$ I downloaded the data from here and I studied the data for the United States of America. Is the low correlation because of the fact that the market needs time to react to unemployment rates? If so how did Phillips study it in the first place? 

We consider highways to be an example of an impure private good because while it is non-excludable, it is a rival good. That is, another person's consumption (usage) of the highway affects my usage of it. In that same sense, wouldn't a fire station also be rival, at least in theory? For example, if a fire stations has five trucks for a locality, and 6 fires break out at separate places, why can't we consider this service as a rival service? 

IS moves to the right (1 to 2) At B, there is a deficit in BOP, which causes the domestic currency to depreciate. This increases exports and decreases imports, which causes net exports to increase, which then causes Y to increase, which shifts IS further up (IS 3). At B, because of increase in net exports, BOP improve and so BP also shifts to the right. The economy settles at the new equilibrium C. 

Let's say we have a soft-drinks store. Say the store sells Pepsi and Coke. If the retailer drinks a bottle of coke from his own store, does that get counted into the GDP of a nation? Or is it only counted if someone else apart from the store owner consumes it by paying for it? How does this work?
