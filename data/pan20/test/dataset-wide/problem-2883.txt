The use of language implies "ontological commitments". By posting this answer to your question, I am committing to the weird and undemonstrable ideas that you exist, that languages exist, and that it is possible to make meaningful statements about existing things. From this, of course, it does not follow any kind of linguistic idealism, such as "if we can talk about unicorns, then they must 'exist' in some sence at least". 

Are you confusing Chomsky the linguist with Chomsky the political hack? Yes, they coexist in the same person, but they are quite different from one another(1). It is impossible to ignore Chomsky the linguist, never mind how much you hate Chomsky the pundit. That's not to say that his linguistics are above criticism, but to realise that criticism of his linguistics is only possible due to his own linguistics. They are the state of art in liguistics, or were so not long ago, and progress in linguistics is not going to happen without a very sound and thorough analysis and refutation of his contributions. (1) They are so much incompatible with each other that while Chomsky's politics are quite left of the centre (though not so much as rabid right-wingers suppose), his scientific contributions are based on a quite right-wing trope, the idea of an instinctual, hard-wired, ability to learn languages. 

"Left" and "right" as political concepts are from the 18th Century, and the dichotomy originally refers to the dispute between supporters (right) and opponents (left) of feudalism, so it cannot be validly extrapolated to anythihing older than feudalism. Spartakus or Tiberius Gracchus weren't leftists. Left and Right as we understand (though quite often we try to misunderstand rather than understand) them aren't metaphysical principles; they are purely historical realities, utterly dependent of the development of the actual forces of society. The terms were invented by supporters of an absolutist monarchy, so unsurprisingly they used the term "right" to describe themselves, and "left" to describe their enemies. There are only two sides of our bodies, relative to the antero-posterior plane, left and right, and it stands to reason that when two humans face each other - as the president of an assembly regarding the ordinary members - that the left side of one corresponds to the right side of the other. So if the friends of the president stand to his right, he may call them the "right" of the assembly, taking himself as a standard. If they sit to his left, on the other hand, he might also call them the "right" of the assembly, now taking the benches as the standard. So, whatever the actual topographic position of supporters and opponents, the political "right" can call itself the right side, with all ideological load that this carries. The "political compass" seems to be an instrument of political propaganda for the Libertarian Party, US. It attempts to frame political positions in a way that the best aspects of each "left" (ie, the Democrats, which in most of the world would be considered centrists at most) and "right" (ie, the Republicans) seem to match the Libertarian policies. It ignores the brutal fact that no serious political force embraces such apparently obviously excellent positions - which is probably best explained by the fact that the "best" aspects of what they call "left" are intimately intertwinned with what they consider the "worst" of that same left, and do not mingle well with what they consider the "best" aspects of what they call "right". Indeed, there is no reason why the political field should be bidimensional instead of uni- or tridimensional, nor is there any reason why, even if we agree that it is bidimensional, that it should take the form of a perfect square instead of an elongated rombus or rectangle. The quote you give from the Dao De Jing doesn't seem to be about politics at all. It seems to describe complementary, not opposite, aspects of life. 

Many years ago I took a philosophy class that covered Descartes. The teacher logically explained to us the "I think Therefore I am" over the course of a week. He also said that it was one of the very few things that you could prove. He made it seem like there were other things that could also be proven at the most basic of levels, but he never talked about them. He then went on to some other topic I think it was about Leibnitz and Monads. My question is, are there other ideas or things that are provable like the "I think therefore I am" and if so, what are they? I'm also aware from reading Wikipedia that the "I think therefore I am" can be generalized even further. But are there any fundamental ideas like it that can also be proven? I don't know if this helps, but apparently this teacher is one of the best in understanding and interpreting the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. So it's possible that some of those provable ideas he was referring to might be from Kant. edit: I want a list of proved things in bullet format preferably. From the other similar questions I was able to get: 1.cogito ergo sum 2.axioms of logic Are there anymore? 

You have it right. That's exactly the way it works. Also what might be of interest is a concept called the backwards light cone. Which is just a fancy way of pointing out the search area of where you can get information to predict an event exactly. For example say that you are flipping a coin and you have all the information you need to predict what side it will be facing up when it lands, but then right at the last flip in the air before it lands the sun comes up. The first ray of light from the sun and the photons from that light hit your coin and the energy from those photons are somehow just barely enough to make the coin flip to the other side of the coin than what you predicted. Because the speed limit of the universe is the speed of light then the backwards light cone tells you that as long as something is farther than the time it would take to reach what you are trying to predict at the speed of light then you don't need that extra information. Sunlight takes 8.3 mins starting at the surface of the sun to reach the surface of the earth. Light from Alpha Centauri takes 4.37 years to reach earth. In order to get all the information to predict some future event using the backwards light cone you know that you can figure out the maximum distance that something can be from your event in order to have an effect on the outcome. edit: You mentioned that it's possible that particles in Quantum Mechanics don't behave randomly, the name of that idea is Bohmian Mechanics and has the key feature that there is a hidden variable that explains QM without randomness. 

So here we get to the case where P1 can no longer be true. If the cat is on the mat, then the mat is purple. But we have now empirically verified that the cat is on the mat, and the mat is blue, or pink with yellow polka dot. So, when P2 is true, and P3 false, the implication itself is false. This gets confused because when in common parlance we hear "if... then" we tend to associate this with causation, as if P → Q meant "P causes Q". But in logic-ese "if.. then" doesn't work like that. The mat isn't purple because the cat is on it, and the cat isn't on it because it is purple (she is on it because she is tired, or sleepy, or bored, or some other cat reason; the mat being purple is a condition, but not the cause, of the present cat-on-the-matness). What P → Q means in the context of logic classes is exactly this: "P is never the case when Q is not the case". Hope this helps. 

Of course, we could make the dilemmas more tempting by stating that the sacrificial lamb in each conundrum is an utilitarian philosopher. Would I save 19, or even just five, lives at the market cost of one utilitarian philosopher? Wellllll.... that's a thougher question. A true Black Friday offer, I would say. 

In Darwin there is no abstract "fitness": evolutionary traits are fit, or unfit, for a given environment. Being white and very furry makes one fit for survival in the Arctic, not so in equatorial jungles. Besides that, it is clear that evolutionary traits must be inherited, or their selection would bear no consequences. Whatever it "takes" to be "successful" within a human society, there is no reason to believe they are inherited traits. And inequality within human societies presupposes the successful reproduction of the "unfit", too: if only the mighty capitalists survived and reproduced, who would toil for them in their factories? Plus, Darwinism is a theory about, well, the origin of the species. It pressuposes, as such, the existence of many different species, which compete for survival in natural environments. But human societies are by definition composed by only one species; how would one discuss the "origin of species" in a society that has no different species to begin? And for such reason, social Darwinism cannot ever properly define what it is talking about. Is it about the survival and procreation of human individuals? In such case one has to admit that the poor are much more "successful" than the rich, because they make up, what, about 90% of mankind. Or is it about a completely different thing, the economic success of individuals and companies in capitalist markets? If this is the case, then it completely fails to acknowledge how things happen. Companies do not reproduce in a biological sence; whatever traits make them successful in capitalist competition cannot therefore be inherited. Human individuals do reproduce - but "what it takes" to be a successful capitalist doesn't seem to be inheritable at all. Indeed, even the common sence folk lore knows that: "rich parents, noble children, poor grandchildren". So, the relevant levels in biology do not find adequate equivalents in social science. In biology, there are genes, subcellular structures, cells, individuals, species, and biosystems. "Biologist" theories of society cannot accomodate those different levels to a different subject. If society is the equivalent of biosystems, what is the equivalent of individuals? Or of species? That, precisely, is where social darwinism fails. Economical competition among humans in a human society is extremly different from biological competition among animals of diverse species in a biosystem. Hence the flaw. 

I remember as a teen studying Macbeth thinking that the quoted text was the most rational thing Macbeth says in the whole play. Why doesn't he take his own advice? (There wouldn't have been much drama left). I you believe that X outcome is will necessarily occur, as a matter of destiny or fate, why engage in any action A to bring about X? Furthermore, isn't it irrational to engage in A when it incurs some further cost (as indeed it does for Macbeth)? This is a common leitmotif in stories concerning fate. It always makes me wonder why people, who apparently do believe in prophecies about themselves, go to all the trouble of helping to fulfill the prophecy - often with tragic consequences. It's pretty clear that [spoiler!] things don't turn out well for Macbeth. His overall behaviour is not rational, even by the metric of achieving his own ends. Let's imagine the play turns out somewhat differently and he gets away with his crime. Even in this scenario, he has to live with the knowledge of killing a "graceful and renowned" man. The cost of attempting to bring about his destiny is huge: a significant risk of things spiralling out of control and a murder which must be, even from a self-interested perspective, emotionally traumatising. The cost of waiting for things to happen 'without his stir' appears modest by contrast: perhaps waiting slightly longer to be king. On the model of expected utility, he should heed his own advice. I think there are parallels with Newcomb's paradox ($URL$ This trades on a similar concept: the idea of infallible (or near infallible) prediction. What are the philosophical approaches to fate and rationality? What would they make of Macbeth's behaviour? 

Try a proof by contradiction. Assume that you are deciding between average utility and total utility. If you deny total utility, you are left with average utility. But then it turns out that a world consisting of a single person who is averagely happy (albeit lonely...) would be as good a world as the one we currently live in. Even if you value some goods that come from community or variety or difference of cultures, you could have a world that supports these with a fraction of our world's current population. Imagine a world consisting of 0.1% of our population (7 million). One in which people were no more happy nor materially better off than in ours. Wouldn't such a world be worse in respect of its smaller population? Think of how vanishingly unlikely it would be for you to be included within this lucky 7 million. Assuming you think your life has some value, ask yourself why the world would be no worse (or negligibly worse) if you were simply not to exist. Or consider the birth of someone who turns out to be happy, but less than averagely happy. On an 'average' view, the world made worse by the birth of this person. You can play around with these examples to create intuition pumps against average utility. A plausible way to deal with these problems is to say that each person's happiness makes the world a better place irrespective of the effect of this on the average. The problem with total utility you point to is sometimes called the repugnant conclusion (or Mere addition paradox),
