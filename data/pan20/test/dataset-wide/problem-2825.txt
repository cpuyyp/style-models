Similar to your questions, another interesting permutation to evaluate is "if I take my brain and put it in your body... am I me, am I you, or are we a new person?" More question arises from conditions like Dissociative Identity Disorder (previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder). I would think that for a materialist, no matter the number of personalities, a person with D.I.D. is one person. However to a dualist, I believe the question of whether each distinct personality is a distinct "mind" would be complicate the issue, and lea them to say that each personality is a different person. 

I think this is a strict programming scenario where "True" is treated as a variable, and not in any philosophical way. For example in VBA "True" is equivalent to -1, while False is equivalent to 0. Other programming languages define "True" as 1. If that is the case with Python, it follows that 1 + 1 > 1. In Philosophy, True + True = True because Truth is not a divisible value. 

In an interesting other post 'you cannot refute the truth; for Socrates is easily refuted': How does this rebut disagreeing disputatiously? there are two great quotes from Socrates and Aristotle. 

Since this is a modern trend being widely implemented, it is a suitable answer - and the end to many people's investigations. It was my experience that strictly studying business as a practical subject was limited to strictly finding a solution to a problem and never discussing the deeper implications of those decisions. However, in studying philosophy I delved into other facets of the questions; i.e. "If outsourcing will eventually raise the cost of labor in a country, is this a sustainable practice?", "Is exporting labor exploitive?", and "What role does a business play in the community that sustains it?". Many of these questions fell outside of the scope of a business study, but integrally informative in practical business. 

The meaning of a sentence seems to me to be a relation between the sentence and something which is beyond the sentence. A senseless sentence is just a sentence, a mere sentence . A meaningful sentence is somehow more than a mere sentence. It is so by being related, in a way that a senseless sentence is not. A meaningful sentence is related to "the external world". The "world" is "external" to the related sentence, it is beyond the sentence. The above raw definition covers both semantic meaning, where one uses terms like 'refer' or 'denote' to express the relation of words to the world; and pragmatic meaning, where the word-world relation is thought to be practical ("meaning is use"). 

While the intension/extension distinction is ancient and unproblematic, the details of sense/reference (denotation) distinction are controversial, and are still evolving. I will suggest here a simplified version. The sense/denotation distinction is similar to the intension/extension distinction, just that the intension/extension distinction applies to general names, predicates, expressions that purport to represent general types and properties. 

Quine's thesis about the inscrutability of reference has nothing to do with context-dependence. As you noticed yourself, the context is just one more means to fix a reference. It is not a reason for skepticism about the nature of reference. Rather, Quine's inscrutability of reference thesis comes from one aspect of the gap, in inferences from the particular to the universal. Faced with a particular object, how do I find the right general terms to describe it? Is this a "rabbit", or maybe "undetached rabbit parts", as in Quine's famous "gavagai" example? An inference from the particular to the universal has been called induction. And indeed, Quine's inscrutability of reference thesis is akin to Nelson Goodman's New Riddle of Induction. Put briefly, the "old" riddle of induction was: faced with some particular green (e.g.) objects, can I justify a thesis about green objects in general? The "new" riddle of induction is: faced with some green objects, is it correct to describe them as 'green', or rather as (e.g.) 'grue', for purposes of generalization? When grue = green until date XYZ, blue hence. Quine argued that many possible conceptualizations are equally correct. That there was no fact of the matter which conceptualization was more correct. Goodman tried to explain, how we in fact choose one candidate conceptualization over another: the logic of induction. 

While the dualist and materialist do not agree on the origins of the mind, I believe that both hold agree that it is the existence of a mind that establishes personhood. Descarte described an animal brain as a clockwork mechanism devoid of a mind. Therefore, the sheep's brain in a human's body is an animal. In the reversal, where a human brain in transplanted into a sheep, personhood could perhaps be transferred too. For a Dualists it would depend on if the mind is also transferred. For the Materialist, the mind necessarily transfers where the brain goes (if the brain maintains its functionality). This is also true for a literal "brain in the vat" scenario. However, to ask if the mind could be "downloaded" into a computer, rather than transferring the brain to a vat frames the question slightly differently. It poses little issue to the dualist, since the mind is separate from the brain, and the computer would simply replace the mechanical portion of the current role of the brain. However, to a materialist, each mind is the result of a specific brain, therefore begs the question of how the same mind could exist outside the specific brain of its origins. 

Cultural diversity and ethnic heritage are great things to expose your children to, especially when they are young. 

Patterns and symmetry are abound in Nature, but a sense of numerals isn't inherent. The numerals are a construct, a human method of expressing those patterns and to create grouping. The universality of math as "the language of nature" has more to do with a need to quantify nature to create models for deeper understand. These numbers are representations of repeated experiences, not necessarily inherent qualities of a specific item or of Nature as a whole. A good example of this is the calendar. There are many different calendars throughout human history. Our current gregorian calendar was even modified to include two extra months in recognition of Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar (July and August respectively). This is why September, October, November and December (each representing a numeral - 7, 8, 9, 10 - are actually the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th months). Additionally every 4 year we have a leap year, because the orbit of the earth around the sun actually takes approximately 365 1/4 days. Both of these examples help to demonstrate how we use number to create representations of natural events. But those events, while perhaps regular and relatively dependable, do not necessarily perfectly align numerically. Variation is seen all throughout Nature. 

Actually, chapter VIII of Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind (EPM), and section 35 in particular, do not contain any arguments against the Given, certainly not the main argument. The role of chapter VIII (whose title is "Does Empirical Knowledge Have a Foundation?") to present the typical account of empirical knowledge that is associated with the Given, and then to suggest an alternative. The chapter just presents one account beside another. It does not argue against the account of the Given. 

I don't think that Kant's existence-argument poses a special problem for bundle theories. The thrust of Kant's argument is that the following two questions are separate and independent: the first, whether x exists, the second, what is x like, i.e. what properties x possesses. Existence is, according to Kant, neither a property, nor an entity of any kind. Bundle theories pertain to the second question, what x (in this case, a particular entity) is like. Bundle theories hold that a particular is a bundle of properties, without an additional substance or substratum. The question, what is a particular like is, according to Kant's argument, independent of the question whether the particular exists or not. Kant's famous example was: a hundred thalers possesses the same properties, whether it is imaginary or real. And it is immaterial to the point of the example whether the hundred thalers is a substance, a property bundle or whatever. So if Kant was right, there is no use for an existence-property, whether we believe in bundles or in substances. There are other theories which do support existence-properties, but these theories are unrelated to the question of bundles. 

Heidegger would certainly agree and would argue that these people have not achieved "being" in the true sense of it. *this answer needs expansion, and I will add later. 

For an animal, there is only first-order desire. Given two desire, the one with the most pull will always win, despite any higher goals or considerations. Or in the case of equal desires, an animal such as "Buridan's ass" (LINK) would be forever stuck. However, Helm argues that a person capable of second-order volition would not be stuck. Instead they could call upon their ability for second-order volition to overcome the deadlock. Thus it is that criteria that must be met to establish personhood, as opposed to an animal mind. 

Thomas Jefferson disagrees with the OP criticism; "the notion of human rights is imaginary and reducible to absurdity (that humans by virtue of being born are magically entitled to certain things)... [and] that human rights are a human invention" Jefferson argues in the Declaration of Independence, that human rights are unalienable which is understood a priori by all individuals in society. 

At the root of the question, Objectivists reject absolute socialism because it requires the explicit commitment (though often acquired through tacit consent) of an entire society. It also sets many limitations on pursuing personal needs, in lieu of a collective equality. Theoretically, this collective equality is supposed to provide a greater collective freedom, since those with not enough are liberated from their strife. However, a strict socialist economy wholly rejects Capitalist behaviors because they contradict the required collective commitments of Socialist economics. Oppositely, socialist behavior isn't outright rejected by Capitalism. Capitalism endorse a freedom to choose, relying on the "invisible hand" of the free market to create the equilibrium of the social and economic distribution of goods, services and capital. This freedom allows anyone to act out their socialist ideals, though they may not be the most effective or sustainable method. In this way its clear why an Objectivist, who values that freedom to act in one's own best interests, would support a system that emphasizes personal freedom, over collective freedom. 

And he finds that he does have, after all, a natural inclination, an unrelenting curiosity about his own motives and reasons, that brings him back again and again to philosophy. 

Pyrrho was reported, by his skeptic followers in later eras, to be the first philosopher who argued, directly and thoroughly, about our lack of ability to know reality as it is. This should be distinguished from: 

Hegel took Plato (not Parmenides) to be the ancient inventor of dialectic. Plato in turn is described as following on Socrates, who is said to be the inventor of "subjective" dialectic, a method or technique. Plato is deemed the father of "objective" dialectic, as an inherent aspect of philosophy. 

Contingent existence seems to have been a "matter of fact" for Hume. He supposed all "relations of ideas" to be knowable with certainty. Therefore contingent existence, to the extent that it is not known with certainty, must be a matter of fact. 

Aristotle argued against regimes ruled by a small (minority) class, on the ground that such a regime cannot remain stable for long. Aristotle advocated a broad ruling class (the middle class) and a wide participation of citizens in the management of the state. One factor that Aristotle preserved, as it were, from Plato's politics was the importance of public education. The corriculum of Aristotle's public education system included some forms of gymnastics and of music. Aristotle also suggeted that future rulers and legislators will study ethics and political theory, similar to his own. But he did not relate studies like higher mathematics or theoretical philosophy to the management of the state, as did Plato. Another political aspect which seems to have been common to Plato and to Aristotle, was that they both viewed the desired state as outwardly peaceful, utilizing military force only for defense, and avoiding the occupation of other states. 

There are several good answers in the other post, and rather than rewriting the whole thing, I am just going to point to that. 

Yes, exposure to religion can bread zealots, and an innumerable number of battles have been fought on the grounds of religion. But religion is not a modern concept and, historically, religion provides social order. The fact that religions largely co-exist in both historic and modern society, shows that it is not an attribute of a religion but rather something in its practitioners. Below I will cover some primary points about the role religion has played, that are both foundational and promotive of a healthy society. Lets first discuss social order. Niccolo Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Thomas Jefferson all discuss that the first founding principle of establishing any society is the collective acceptance of a Sovereign. Whether by force, faith, or solidarity, the people bind together and submit some degree of personal power to the authority, in exchange for safety and communal progress (i.e. we are more capable together than as individuals). Religion is the perfect force to draw in and unify people. It establishes an authority who is omnipotent, yet intangible. Religion also provides security, strength, purpose and order to society. Marx calls religion the "opiate of the masses" because it can pacify them. If you are in a bad situation, religion tells you to put you're energy into faith, redirecting it from the other common targets like the authority or those who prosper while you suffer. The concept of an afterlife is a great example of this. Death is a very difficult thing for people to do with. It can often lead to very serious anxiety and unrest in a individual and/or society. None of us know what happens to our souls after we die, this unknown can be a metaphysically devastating realization. Some would become Nihilistic, not concerned of their own actions because after death it doesn't matter. This would also be an issue for society. Placed in a historical context, being unable to comfort the masses causes unrest and leads to the collapse of order. Some religions offer solace and comfort through the concept of an afterlife or rebirth. Order is further maintained though the concept of heaven, which both provides people with the concept that this life is not the most important, and that a good member of society (each society being composed of the members of a specific religion) is promised a life of glory, all thanks to the devotion despite suffering in this life. This therefore promotes social order, helps to establish a reasoning behind religious laws, and comforts the struggling masses (early society was certainly a difficult life style and it was newly emerging, without the advantage of being historically informed). Though this is more interpretive, I think that evidence of this function of religion is clearly provided from the existence of the Book of Leviticus. The second book of Judaism and Christianity (and following Genesis, because before you can guide people you need to provide them with some answers like, "Where did we come from>"), this contains 613 commandments that touch on all aspects of social life: 1) Public Health - Leviticus contains the laws for keeping Kosher, avoiding shellfish and swine (both can spoil and cause illness if not cleaned correctly). It also contains instructions on how to prepare, clean and preserve meat. The laws go on to even include how to treat illnesses and sets guidelines for quarantine and treat leapers and other diseases that were both common and devastating to a community if not handled correctly. 2) Civil Law - There are a number of very specific civil laws that establish a common set of guidelines that we all abide within a society. Both crime and punishment are laid out. Excessive punishment is also limited within these laws. There are laws about owning land, "no debt shall be held more than 10 years" (including slavery which was a commonly traded commodity in early society). 3) Social Law - In early society, work was a precious commodity, and the community often relied on all its members to provide different portions of what society required to maintain itself. Laws like those surrounding the process of mourning a death (sitting shiva) are set to provide both a structure to loss, but also a limit. In sitting Shiva, after 40 days it is required that mourning ends and that everyone returns to normal life. Another example are The 10 Commandments, such as honor your parents and do not covet your neighbors wife. These may have been the 9 biggest social issues of early society, and the first commandment which compels to you to obey God and his commandments. Please note that this is primarily Judeo-Christian religious belief. Many "eastern" religions focus on establishing order in "Life" and nature itself, rather than our roles in a society. Other pagan and polytheistic religions focused more on recognizing the limits of humanity compared to the natural forces that immensly powerful (Zeus throws lightning bolts, and Rah is the personification of the Sun). But again, these all provide a rational to fill a void, much of which is still unknown despite human advancement (like the concept of the soul). Unfortunately, with such a powerful historic influence, it will take a long time (if ever) for it to dissipate from mainstream society. The important thing to bare in mind is that religion or not, people will find justification for divisions and disagreements. Religion itself does not necessitate radicalism, and in most religions order within a society is foundational if not the entire underlying ends.
