Eye stalks may be a more of a benefit in a swampy/marshy region. It is also possible that an invertebrate species develops intelligence (many sci-fi universes have intelligent insects, the Tholians from Star Trek come to mind) My first consideration is an alligator, that pops only its eyes and nose out of the water. the stalks would give them a few benefits like being able to see in a few directions, but if a bird checked out its eyes and tried to poke them out or something, the could be retraced. they could also be like lures catch birds or something like that. Given that intelligent life on earth evolved after a group of ape-like ancestors were forced out of forested areas onto the plains of Africa, I will allow that some of the alligator like eye-stalk creatures (I'll call them alescs for short) are smart enough to notice some overcrowding and decide to move out of the swamp and onto a plains or forrest environment. they don't have much of an advantage here, so they use and develop intelligence here, in a new environment, and start using tools. 

Naturally NO, Once a object is sufficiently large enough (300 km, 511 Davida), given enough time, the gravitational forces will optimize the shape to make it spherical. Most objects are slightly ellipsoid, to balance out its rotation. There are a few hypothetical objects like a neutron star spinning at a very high speed, causing it be ellipsoid, elongated, almost like an egg. Artificial/Man-made objects can be square, this would also include stars, planets, and satellites. For a species to achieve this it has to be above Kardashev scale 2.0. You can manipulate electromagnetism to create a thin layer of plasma around an object and force it to conform to that shape, or perhaps use swarms of nanobots made of carbon tubes to create a artificially box, similar to what @Durakken mentioned. But science of any of this artificial structures is beyond the scope of my imagination. 

If the people in the alternate reality in question have a basic knowledge of genetics: Females have only X sex chromosomes while males have both an X and a Y. The Y chromosome is inseparably connected to their spirit in a way that X chromosomes never are. Since these are the chromosomes responsible for developing a person's reproductive system, the reproductive contribution of a male is the spirit, where the female's is everything else. If they don't: To be honest, you probably don't even have to explain anything. Just state what happens as you did in the question and that'll be enough of an explanation on its own. 

My answer will incorporate some non-dolphin get them out of the toxicity of the changing water. Since the water is likely becoming toxic due to humans, I will allow a group of humans to help out some dolphins by creating a "landed dolphin refuge". Since dolphins are intelligent, humans chose to help them out in hopes of them one day being evolved enough to function in modern society. They would likely start coming out of water near the poles as Tom O'Daighre suggested in his answer because their fat layers would insulate them heavily, so the first dolphin refuge will be somewhere in Antarctica. since dolphins can't really move on land the humans will have to help them out here. My first thought is that they lay on a skateboard roll around using their fins to push them. Of course a human manufacturer will have to train them at first and then provide the skateboards. I'm not sure what language capabilities dolphins have, but I will assume they currently have a vocabulary much less than humans, and also much lesser sentence structure. Quickly their speech will become somewhat similar to humans (likely still as patterns of clicks and whistles); language is learned by humans, so I think this will evolve as quickly as dolphins can invent new words and structures. There will likely also be a human effort to learn dolphin language, and communicate with them, further boosting their linguistic abilities. Within 3 or 4 generations I would expect them to communicate on a level similar to humans. their language transmission and recieving capability over air will likely also improve. Humans could introduce more advanced evolutionary tactics such as selective breeding or eugenics, to develop better on land characteristics. I will also prohibit direct gene manipulation for ethical and possibly technological reasons. over 25 or 30 generations of dolphin-imposed selective breeding, their fins would begin to lengthen into arms, allowing them to scoot better on land while still swimming, and catch things with their arms, likely an early development will be throwing/kicking dirt (or snow, as it is Antarctica) at prey. In a few more generations they may also begin to re-develop fingers to use tools like spears or axes to hunt or fell trees, dig holes and develop primitive structures. Likely they will be able to hunt on land but decide to continue hunting/fishing underwater. With human level communications skills, I'd be surprised if they did not catch the whole capitalism thing. Drilling companies could employ them to inspect underwater equipment, with time they could possibly repair or perform preventative maintenance underwater. The navy may employ them in submarine detection, and possibly covert insertions. they could also be employed as underwater tour guides, or underwater archaeological specialists (or marine biologists, etc). As amphibious beings dolphins could hold many positions we have not thought of yet. 

I will assume that there exists a centralized semi-autocratic government which can enforce all these ideas, at the cost few civil liberties, and has sufficient basic resources. The best possible situation is when you see humans as resources to optimize and invest in. Cities and Buildings City designs and building designs would be completely different, most building would consist of both residential, retail, entertainment, school/university and work. Most people will work, reside and be capable of living in the same building drastically reducing travel time. All buildings would conserve space, resources and be utilitarian, rather than a status symbol. Even things inside the houses would be utilitarian all costly decorative things would be discouraged. Some devices or objects would communal for maximum efficiency and usage. Travel Cars/Vehicles would be fully automated, the reason it is hard to make a self driving car is that AI has to compensate for human errors. By enforcing mandatory automated vehicles, you can bypass the problem increasing efficiency and speed. Air Travel would be very limited, a rare luxury, same for Cruises, and any form of recreational vacations. Most transport vehicles/ships used for inter-city trade would be limited to essential raw materials. Any objects which adds to transport would a luxury, this includes but not limited to artisan products, crops/plants/animals which do not get cultivated locally, ornamental objects. Energy We currently have technology to make 100% safe nuclear reactors with no radiation leakage, which automatically shuts down to avert possible catastrophe, without the stigma associated most of energy will come from nuclear with some renewable. Centralized energy efficiency would lead to automated factories shutting down at evening to accommodate the increase in usage due to people returning homes. Energy intensive systems would work nights and afternoons. Unused public lights, house lights would automatically and if necessary remotely shut down. Refrigerators, ACs, heater would be forced to run at limited near optimal range of temperatures. Computer Computers will always be connected to decentralized system which will be used to spy, delegate excess computational capabilities, information from people will be used help them psychological and used to assign optimal jobs. Blockchain and other better technology will be used to optimize all possible resources. Centralized education to enforce ideas and culture of conservation. Others Standardized components, limited choice, mass producible objects, a system similar to decentralized communism. Having a hobby would become a luxury. Outdoor entertainment would be replaced by online games. Guns, weapons and military would be limited to bare essentials. Religion would be non existent, or be forced to spread the values of optimization and cooperativeness. Spying would allow easy detection crime and fraud. Even forcing only genetically better hand picked in-vitro babies. Democracy and free media would be banned/restricted as it starts propaganda warfare, all jobs/positions would be merit based. There would be a lot cultural changes forced upon people. 

One scientist referred to lobotomies as "surgically induced childhood," which would certainly be a solution to a criminal having too much intellect for their own good. 2. Brain-eating creatures In some universes there are creatures that feed upon the brains of humans, while leaving the rest of their bodies intact. For example, Mind Flayers in D&D or Ceti Eels in Star Trek both affect the brains of sentient beings in a very damaging way. However, this method has the greatest potential for getting out of hand and reducing the victim to a vegetative state, or killing them completely -- therefore, those inflicting the punishment would need to exert strict control over the creature that was unleashed on the victim's brain, stopping them as soon as their brain has been damaged enough. 3. Intellect-affecting spells If magic is a part of your world, a permanent variation of a Confusion or Curse spell could very effectively prevent their scheming. Another option is a spell of Bad Luck, which if powerful enough (and again, permanent) could effectively prevent them from making any significant intellectual breakthrough, thus foiling all their plans before they even happen. 

Maybe Yes Man running on water has been the subject of several scientific papers. In particular Google for papers by J. W. Glasheen and T. A. McMahon. They studied the basilisk lizard, but their results can be extrapolated to humans. It's debatable how reliable such a large extrapolation is, but the result is that the required speed is so far beyond human ability that we can safely conclude it's impossible without some artificial aid. There's a summary of the results from the papers in this article and a more general summary here. The conclusions are that you have to run at a speed of 30m/sec, almost 3 times as fast as Usain Blot (10.4 m/sec). Which doesn't sound too bad, but you'd need to generate a mechanical power of 12kW to do it. Trained athletes can just about manage half a kW, and most of us would struggle to generate 200W. If you generate 12kW, you would probably be roasted from within. You can reduce this by having wider feet, webbed feet, stronger muscles, some way to dissipating heat, the most ideal way would be to reduce its height and weight. Even then it would hard for a being to keep it up for a more than a few seconds time. 

Summary If you are looking to make a lava lake that creatures can plausibly swim through, a mixture of super high temperatures and compositions of iron and magnesium will most likely yield the best results. 

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -Arthur C. Clarke (more info) In other words, you should treat magic like another form of technology. Other answers have tried to argue that using magic over technology precludes the need for both education and research, but in all magic systems I can think of: 

Meditation, or Mindfulness, this can be achieved through genetic mutation, by increase few brain chemicals for alerts and decreasing or eliminating flight or fight responses. This could happen through lack of predators, easy accessible resources, but some reason to be in present. In our world when the practitioner attains certain level of mastery in meditation and mindfulness, their sleep acquires a character of meditation. It's not like they don't sleep at all, but they do retain certain level of deep awareness during their sleep. Specifically, when they see a dream, they know it's a dream. They remain aware of their body lying down on the bed. They remain aware of the content of their consciousness no matter how disjointed it gets during a deep sleep. If something happens around them, they wake up easily to provide their help if needed. Mediators also have been know to sleep less, more like 2hours a day. And here is a old BBC article about monks who sleep upright. Something similar but more genetic/biochemistry in nature, so it happens to all members the species. Culturally it would more like spirit walk than a dream because they can if necessary return to real world. Due to it being genetic it would more prominent, it would be really interesting society. 

Water is not necessary for a planet to have an atmosphere. Planets like Mars have atmospheres without there being water on the planet. (It is worth noting that Mars' atmosphere is about 100x thinner than Earth's, but that is due to its lack of magnetic field rather than any lack of water. In fact, the article just linked states that its thin atmosphere is the reason all the surface water on Mars dried up.) Even if you need a human-breathable atmosphere, there is no need for water vapor. As explained in this answer, the atmospheric pressure and relative amounts of different gasses in the atmosphere will have a much greater effect on an atmosphere's breathability than the presence or absence of water will. As for humans needing drinking water to survive on the planet in the first place, you could have it shipped in from other planets if space travel is available, or have moisture farmers (sort of Luke's aunt and uncle on Tatooine) that mine or gather water from the sparse underground sources you mentioned.
