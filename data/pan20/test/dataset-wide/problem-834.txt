The problem of determining the solar parallax (and inversely the Sun's distance from Earth) by classical optical astronomy has been in most periods since the 17th century dominated less by principle than by the great difficulties of controlling and reducing the measurement errors of the very small angles involved (the solar parallax is only about 8.794" of arc). A good reference source for the earlier period through the 18th century is Albert van Helden's "Measuring the Universe" (1985, Chicago UP). The method of observing planetary transits across the Sun's disk in order to determine the solar parallax was arguably a method of clear choice mainly or only for the 18th-century solar transits of Venus, which took place only in 1761 and 1769. The measurement advantage in observing the Venus transits (relative to a difficult direct solar-parallax determination) arises largely because Venus at inferior conjunction is only about a quarter the distance of the Sun, thus its parallax in that configuration is not far off four times as large as the Sun's. What was to be measured directly was the parallax of Venus itself rather than that of the Sun. The size of the parallax angle to be measured was one of a number of factors that it was hoped would allow a smaller relative error in the observational determination. Conversion from the parallax of Venus to that of the Sun was done by using the comparatively much-better-determined relative scale of solar-system distances. (By contrast, Mercury transits, though more frequent in occurrence than those of Venus, only allow measurement of Mercury's parallax, which is not too much bigger at inferior conjunction than the Sun's own parallax itself, thus offering less advantage than a Venus measurement.) By the time of the 19th-century Venus transits (again only two, in 1874 and 1882) there was an accumulated experience of the practical measurement difficulties, some of which (like the 'black-drop effect') had not been expected before the 18th-century transits were actually observed. The difficulties meant that advance expectations of measurement accuracy from the 18th-century Venus transits had proved to be over-optimistic. There was some remaining optimism that the measurement difficulties could be addressed, and expeditions were mounted to observe the 19th-century Venus transits, but still the results were not as much better than before as had been hoped. (A useful reference source for this part of the history is J Ratcliff (2008) "The Transit of Venus Enterprise in Victorian Britain".) In the meantime, competing methods of measuring the Sun's parallax began to be devised, and a more successful example was indeed an Earth-planet distance: to Eros, a minor planet whose orbit brought it much closer to the Earth than Venus' distance at solar transit. The crucial aim again was to measure by parallax a distance that should be as close as possible (and well-determined on the relative solar-system scale of distances, like distances of Venus and other planets). The measurements in the Eros case at its close approach to Earth were done by reduction of photographs and of the positions of Eros relative to selected reference stars as seen from a number of observing stations (A R Hinks, 1904, 'Reduction of Photographs of Eros, with a Determination of the Solar Parallax' ($URL$ From the 1960s onwards, the traditional optical methods of determining solar and planetary distances using solar transits and close approaches of minor planets were entirely superseded by ranging methods, one of the earliest examples being radar-signal reflection from Venus (reviewed along with the Eros measurements e.g. by Eckstein (1963), $URL$ More recently many other range measurements have been obtained e.g. to spacecraft placed in orbit around solar-system bodies. 

Earlier answers pointed out that this question is based on a mistake about general relativity, in which gravity neither pushes nor pulls: but it is also based on a mistake about Newton's view and about what he wrote. Newton was emphatic in refusing to commit himself to identify gravitational attraction either as a push or as a pull. He said he was concerned only with the mathematical quantities and relations of the forces, etc. He wrote that he used the words 'attraction' and 'impulse' indifferently, 'one for another' in respect of the general propensity of massive bodies to approach each other, and he expressly abstained from speculation about their physical nature or cause (see quotations below). Accordingly, just as the other answers point out that GRT does not specify gravitation as either a push or a pull, neither did Newton's physics. Whether in GRT or in Newtonian physics, the answer 'push' or 'pull' is unnecessary to an account of the physics. The question in effect poses a false antithesis. Here is the basis so far as what Newton wrote. In the opening parts of the 'Principia', in Definition VIII, Newton wrote (quoted here from the 1729 English translation of his original Latin, available online at $URL$ "I ... use the words Attraction, Impulse or Propensity of any sort towards a centre, promiscuously, and indifferently, one for another; considering those forces not Physically but Mathematically : Wherefore, the reader is not to imagine, that by those words, I any where take upon me to define the kind, or the manner of any Action, the causes or the physical reason thereof, or that I attribute Forces, in a true and Physical sense, to certain centres (which are only Mathematical points) ..." In the same vein, his Definition V stated that "a centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn or impelled, or any way tend, towards a point as to a centre". Later on he emphasised yet again the same abstention from speculation (Principia, Book 1, Section XI, Scholium following Proposition 69): "I here use the word attraction in general for any endeavour, of what kind soever, made by bodies to approach to each other; whether that endeavour arise from the action of the bodies themselves as tending mutually to, or agitating each other by spirits emitted; or whether it arises from the action of the aether or of the air, or of any medium whatsoever, whether corporeal or incorporeal, any how impelling bodies placed therein towards each other. In the same general sense I use the word impulse, not defining in this treatise the species or physical qualities of forces, but investigating the quantities and mathematical proportions of them; as I observed before in the definitions." 

The formula 28 from SPA that you linked is given with units and in a form that do not match official versions. It takes a little work to 'translate' it: also, it is needlessly susceptible to roundoff error (because all significant figures for both the date and time-of-day are strung together in one very long number). The authors of SPA do not appear to have been striving for full official accuracy, probably their application did not require that. I can't quite work out from the data in the question what might have happened to the calculations, online or otherwise, but maybe the following reference data could be of help. GMST for 0h UT is still tabulated in the Astronomical Almanac, and there are also two rather easy formulae derived from the official definitions that you can use (see below), they make somewhat better preservation of end-figures than a calculation in the SPA form. In the meantime, just for reference, the Astronomical Almanac for 2003 gave the GMST for 0h UT on 2003 Oct 17 as 1h 40m 21.4554s (1.6726265 h). That is for 0h UT, and during the following 24h, the GMST for x hr UT is is easily found, it is very close to $ [ (GMST for 0h) + x * 1.00273791 ] $ . 2003 was a changeover year for the official (IAU) calculations that relate GMST and UT1. Before 2003, the formula of Aoki et al (1982), "The new definition of universal time" ($URL$ was the one adopted. From 2003 Jan 1 the formula of N Capitaine et al. (2003), "Expressions to implement the IAU 2000 definition of UT1", Astronomy & Astrophysics 406, 1135-1149 ($URL$ was (and still is) adopted. The difference between the results during 2003 was small (+0.0003 time-secs to get the result of the newer calculation), but it looks as if AA for 2003 was still using the older 1982 formula. The Aoki et al (1982) formula gave : GMST of 0h UT (in time-secs) = $ 24110.54841 + 8640184.812866 *Tcy + 0.093104 *Tcy^2 -0.0000062*Tcy^3 $ plus a very small correction for DeltaT: this can be had from the version of the Aoki formula given in the Capitaine reference at B.3 on page 1149, (which seems to be the one that was used in official calculations) but it can practically be left out at the precision of the data in the question. Tcy means the time interval from J2000 (Julian Date 2451545.0) reduced to centuries of 36525 days. (The JD for 0h on 2003 Oct 17 0h UT was JD(UT) 2452929.5 days and DeltaT was close to +64.55 secs.) The current formula from the Capitaine (2003) reference (most conveniently from formula B.2 on page 1149) gives $ 24110.5493771 + 8640184.7945360 *Tcy + 0.0931118*Tcy^2 -0.0000062*Tcy^3 $ plus a very small fourth-order term (given in the reference but omitted here) and again a very small correction for the slight effect of DeltaT which can be left out or included if desired as $ +307.4771600 * DeltaT/(86400.0*36525.0) $ (time-secs), where DeltaT is still in seconds. 

Some confusion may have arisen in parts of the literature due to the facts that (a) the moon's mean rate of angular motion (and revolution speed) does appear to be speeding up if it is measured by mean solar time or by sidereal time, but also (b) the mean rate appears to be slowing down if it is measured by an atomic or dynamical time-scale. That is because there are (at least) three real effects in operation: (1) an apparent increase in the moon's rate of motion caused by the long-term slowing-down of earth rotation (when the day is longer the moon would appear to go further even if its real rate is unchanged), (2) a real increase in the moon's rate due to the long-term reduction in the eccentricity of the earth-sun orbit, and (3) a real decrease in rate due to tidal retardation of the moon's motion itself. The sum of all three effects is an apparent net positive acceleration. (When effect (1) is included, that of course implies the use of a mean solar or sidereal clock and time-scale.) But if apparent effect (1) is taken out, by using an atomic timescale instead, the remaining real effect (3) more than offsets real effect (2), leaving a net negative acceleration (retardation). Historically these were discovered in the order, first the aggregate of (1)+(2)+(3) from the 1690s onwards, then effect (2) from the late 1700s, and finally effects (1) and (3) were suspected in the later 1800s and after much work separately verified during the 20th century. Edmond Halley in the 1690s suspected a net positive acceleration; but he could not evaluate it quantitatively, for lack of good geographical longitudes of the places where the ancient moon observations had been taken. He appealed for such measurements in the last two pages (174-5) of a paper of 1693 ($URL$ In the 1740s Richard Dunthorne had better data, and by evaluating ancient moon observations in the near East he estimated the mean acceleration as +10 arc"/cy/cy (arc-seconds, centuries) (sources cited in $URL$ A closer estimate is about +12. Then Laplace in 1788 published results of theoretical calculations of celestial mechanics to identify the real accelerative effect on the moon caused by the (by-then established) slow and slight reduction in eccentricity of the earth-sun orbit ("Sur l'equation seculaire de la Lune", ($URL$ Unfortunately Laplace treated as negligible too many of the smaller components of the infinite series that he had to deal with. His result overestimated the real effect by about double. By chance this seemed to match the whole of the observed apparent acceleration. The apparent agreement between theory and observation quietened further enquiry for about half a century, until in 1853 J C Adams established that a correct calculation of this accelerative effect accounted only for about half of the apparent acceleration observed ("On the secular variation of the moon's mean motion", Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1853 vol.143 397-406) ($URL$ Adams' finding caused a controversy amongst astronomers that lasted some years, but it was finally accepted that Adams (and Delaunay, who confirmed his calculations) were in the right. But that left about half of the observed apparent lunar acceleration still to be accounted for. The size of effect (2) (real positive acceleration due to changing solar eccentricity) was calculated at about +6 arc"/cy/cy from the later 19th-c. onwards. Irregular slowing-down of earth rotation was established more recently, in the 1920s-1930s: previous suspicions were converted to practical certainty by works of E W Brown (1926), W de Sitter (1929) and a more complete quantitative study by H Spencer Jones (1939) ("The rotation of the earth, and the secular accelerations of the sun, moon and planets") ($URL$ This last paper set the basis for a practical time-scale freed from irregular earth-rotation effects, and led via Ephemeris Time ($URL$ to the later varieties of atomic time. The tidal deceleration was first well-measured at about -26 arc"/cy/cy as recently as 1975 by Morrison and Ward ($URL$ by an analysis of traditional optical results (perhaps surprisingly, by a long series of Mercury solar transit timings). As the period of lunar laser-ranging measurements has grown longer and the technique more precise, the 1975 value has been refined more recently to about -25.858 (Chapront et al., 2002 ($URL$ (The 3.8cm or so of annual lunar recess from the earth established by lunar laser-ranging is believed to be a result of the tidal retardation, with relatively small effect on velocity.) The net deceleration in modern estimates of lunar motion on atomic timescales amounts in aggregate to about -11.5 "/cy/cy (relative to equinox of date).
