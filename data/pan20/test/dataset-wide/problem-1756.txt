Can you try to run rpmbuild with -vv so that you see where exactly it choked? Likely the file in question is not found in the working directory for some reason, or otherwise corrupt. Magic number refers to the starting bytes of a unix file. Man magic for details. 

what is your os version and mysql version? depending on what they are, you can use something like /etc/init.d/mysql (could be mysqld in some versions) status to find out if it is running in ubuntu. then you can use locate mysqld.sock to find out if the socket file is actually in the location postfix user is trying to use. 

This is the standard behavior. $URL$ says Clients SHOULD NOT include a Referer header field in a (non-secure) HTTP request if the referring page was transferred with a secure protocol. so if your client is doing that, it is violating the standard. then again, google IS the standard, and they can do whatever they want :-) 

No dynamic change of an existing connection is supported, because the forwarding is set up when the connection established, so you have to reconnect in order to enable/disable this. 

Would you happen to have ssh port still open? If so, you can install a windows sshd server such as openssh server, and tunnel to any other port you want. You can just search for ssh tunnelling for your particular client and find many instructions online. Another way is to change the listening port of remote desktop service to something that is still allowed. 

When the backend is gone, things are all cached either in memory or swap. So if you just want to recover data, you can still ssh, then rsync to some other server what is important for you. You try to dd if and pipe to ssh to dd of to another image. It may or may not work. So the first order should be data saving, and then if you have time left, you can attempt replicating an image. 

I would think limited shell such as $URL$ would be easier for you. Since it is written in python, you can customize it if you cannot get it to work exactly as you want out of box. 

see what it tells you, in addition to what the server says. you can do this in a powershell or cmd window. if you have already generated your default putty public file, you can convert it with ssh-keygen -i -f yourputtypubkeyfile > openssh.key to be added to your authorized_keys 

If it is a running lvm, you should create a snapshot of it, and then back up the snapshot. Otherwise your command looks fine. It is better if you unmount the lvm before doing the copying. Then, force a filesystem check on the resulting loop file before attempting to mount. 

Looks fine but in linux probably there is always some way to get around it, because once you have an account, escalating your priv. is far easier than breaking in, if you do not trust your users. If you are really concerned, I would suggest some sort of restricted or limited shell. These are not hacking-proof either but tend to help with most cases. You can make it a little harder for the user to chattr +i file to make it immutable. 

the parent processes of these processes died but they themselves did not terminate so they have become orphans and thus adopted by process 1, i.e., init. the software usually has problems when this happens a lot, and you may want to consider upgrade to a newer version. 

You might want to look into vagrant up as well, especially if you choose virtualbox as your platform. $URL$ 

you need to find and replace that uuid in your grub configuration, something like /boot/grub/menu.lst in grub. in grub 2, /boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated when you run update-grub, so you could temporarily modify that file and boot, and then change the grub settings and run update-grub once you have booted into your OS. another option is to temporarily replace the uuid reference to the actual disk partition, and again fix that later. 

Yes, it should be your TTL setting, IF all the dns servers are standard and honor that, which is not always the case. You can use a tool like $URL$ to verify the propagation, however. 

It is because you must have used ssh somemachine and ssh somemachine.search.domain in the past, which creates 2 different entries. In ubuntu this is how my entries were created, in any case. 

Linux man page clearly says that "one line per IP address", so what you are doing is undefined. You can get the first one in the file, the last, or random. It is better for your application just to use the ip in this case, maybe based on some criteria. 

yes, godaddy can handle your domain email accounts already so you don't have to install your own mail server. it is probably the simplest way to go. $URL$ however, i have not been actively managing any godaddy domain for a couple of years so you need to read their latest documents and email their support if you have more questions. 

logrotate does not log anything by default. normally it should be in your cron somewhere, for instance: cron.daily/logrotate:/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf you can either run that manually to see what is wrong, or redirect the logrotate output to a file in the above cron to see what happened next day. likely somewhere the config is incorrect and caused the logrotate run to break. 

How did you do P2V? Is it with the converter? For linux vms, you could also just boot up physical and vm both with livecd and do an rsync with grub installation, or dd if the disk sizes are the same. I often find this works better than converter. You can try copy initr image for sure. initrd image is just an archive that among other things loads modules necessary for booting. Is your customized initrd image for handling nonstandard hardware in the phsical server? In any case, loading the modules without the corresponding hw available should not matter. 

If you don't need to use it, yes, burn or smash it with a hammer. Otherwise you can also boot up a ubuntu livecd, install wipe, and wipe the usb clean. This assumes that your OS is not linux. If it is linux to start with, wipe can usually be found for your distro. I found this one for windows, but have not tried it. $URL$ 

You may use heartbeat to detect failure and run a script to change dns. You need to use a dedicated connection for heartbeat. 

It should be available for all major distributions, though not considered part of OS generally, and if it is not installed, any admin can install it. since it is opensource, even distros that don't have it can compile it. There is a windows port as well. 

in a shell. the above will quit when your process is done. you can sleep more if granularity you want is bigger. 

raid 5 in this config should only be seeing 30TB usable space because 1/8 of the space must be used for parity. you can find a raid calculator also by web search. 

if the appliance is shut down, you can mount (unless they somehow disabled that too but i doubt it) the root vmdk in another vm that can read/write the vmdk fs. you can then try to change or add some admin/root auth once you find where the info is. it is possible that the vmdk fs is encrypted. in that case you should contact the vendor, which probably is a good idea in any case. 

plus sign means the last job you suspended, so fg alone will recall it to the foreground. minus sign means the job before the last one that you suspended. what you see agrees with this designation. 

This is the compressed kernel and you should care if it ever changed without you knowing about it, because if the kernel was replaced, you could be open to any attack. It may have been a legitimate reason, but unless you are sure, you should not trust the changed kernel. 

you can, as the blocks are striped across all the pairs. however, it will be n x miminum pair size, where n is the number of pairs, because the smallest pair will stop the striping process, and you will then waste all the space in larger pairs, if you don't mind. 

Buffer pool is for caching retrieved table and index data in memory, query cache just caches the parsed mysql queries. The former is much larger and usually far more important. Sure you can use both. 

this is because the tty that opened need to close and thus cannot keep the command running. to see the output, change /dev/null to an actual file name. i have not tried to use remote screen so I omitted that. you may be able to get it to work but maybe the syntax is off a little bit.
