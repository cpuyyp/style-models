Others have mentioned trading or dumping the stone, but what if they used it to.. Build Entrances to Dwarven strongholds need defending too! Watchtowers, fortresses, subterranean harbours great stone gates and the like would be a good use for a whole lot of that stone. Not to mention first alert outposts and the like. With stereotypical Dwarven aptitudes for building they'd find good uses for large amounts of stone. The first (fantasy) examples that come to mind are: Dwarfs of the Warhammer Old World: 

Ideally need more information about the setting. In a present-day setting, as anon has already said the only real place to find one would be a hospital or long-term facility. In a more sci-fi setting, say for example there's a VR-like leisure facility akin to a cross between the Matrix and the VR Arcade place in Minority Report. Your character could steal bodies away while their consciousnesses are plugged in, this would be easier to get away with if this kind of activity was illegal or frowned upon. Although I can't think of any scenario where you could find a still-living, unconscious body and steal them away without prompting people to search for a missing person. Maybe a drug den or similar? But then your character would have to deal with jumping into a drug-addled vessel. 

The simplest reason would be that Angels armaments of choice (assuming typical Biblical-style angels) would typically be flaming swords. Flaming swords don't have the range to be used from above, and when used in swooping charges have the same issue a lot of cavalry weapons had - they would get stuck in your opponent as you charge past and, best case, you lose the weapon, worst case, your arm comes off at the shoulder or you get dragged from your mount (or in this case, down to the ground and out of flight). There's also the issue of maintaining momentum while flying through the air and suddenly initiating a large force impact with something you're holding, this would typically lead to an almost immediate faceplant afterwards - not exactly inspiring of angelic grace - unless the flaming sword cuts through demons with no resistance like a lightsaber. 

I'm not a frog-person with disproportionately strong legs, nor do I know any in real life, but let me offer some analysis based on many years of experience in medieval-style combat, both individual and melee fights. The shield: You're describing a shield that, in combat posture, covers most of the frog-man's body. This provides good defensive coverage from the front and can be used to intercept blows coming from front and up. It will be harder to move into a position to protect from range weapons, but effective when it can be used (large area). I haven't done a load-bearing analysis of shield-sized rafts, so I am assuming a shield that's reasonably sturdy, probably metal-rimmed for extra protection. The spear: I'm assuming you're describing a one-handed weapon here because of what you said about the shield. It's possible to use a spear two-handed while also using a shield, but usually (in my experience) this is effective only with smaller shields, not the larger ones you've described. A one-handed spear is good at thrusting but probably not slashing. Thrusting requires more strength than slashing (as with a sword) to do comparable damage, and may be more hindered by better armor. You might consider adding swords to your frog-men's equipment list. Spears are quite effective when being charged, particularly in combination with those large shields you've described. When your frog-men fight in groups they should form a shield wall, brace against charges, and maintain formation. In the shield-wall formation they might choose to have second-rank fighters forgo their shields in order to use their spears two-handed (for much-more-effective blows). Sword and shield in the front rank and spear in the second rank is an effective combination. Posture: Being shorter than one's opponent is often a disadvantage, especially if the taller opponent also has longer reach (as when shorter and taller people fight each other; the taller ones tend to have longer arms). But your frog-men have an important advantage: strong jumps. This suggests a tactic where they lurk out of opponents' weapon range waiting for an opening, then jump, strike, and fall back. I would expect this to be comparable in many ways to modern fencing bouts; viewing such bouts might give you ideas. Upper body strength is important in melee fighting, but strength does not come only from the upper body. The best fighters I know (and granted, we're talking re-creation here with wooden weapons, not live steel, and people are not actually trying to kill each other) start pushing a blow from the back foot, through the legs and hips, and into the upper body until it becomes a powerful weapon blow. (This is hard to describe in words, sorry.) My point here is that your frog-men, being particularly strong in the legs, probably have the element of surprise the first time they strike; nobody's going to be expecting that much power from such a little guy. They should aim for tactics where they can use that surprise. Because they can walk upright, they have the ability to trade shield coverage for height advantage on an as-needed basis. Human fighters sometimes try to maintain a crouch for protection too, but we can't do it for extended periods because we're not built for that. Having the ability to choose as conditions dictate should be very powerful. Aerial attacks: Because of those strong legs they can leap -- you said about 4m up. This gives them the ability to leap and strike while dropping back to the ground. I'll leave it to the physicists to compute how powerful their strike would be -- I would expect this could deliver a pretty solid blow, what with gravity on their side like that. However, unless the low-level magic in your world includes flight, once a frog-man is airborne he has limited control over where he goes. Opponents nimble enough to dodge the blow -- or trip him up as he lands -- will be a real danger. Aerial attacks from surprise, on the other hand, can be very effective; if they can ambush their opponents from cover (or even from lower tree branches!) that first blow is likely to be doozy. 

The Navy is the gung-ho American-style "humans first" military. More heart than brains, more firepower than diplomatic nuance, but guys and gals you'd want to have a beer with. They have varied (sometimes conflicted) feelings about Sentient AI. They aren't luddites (there's a regular AI on board for navigation) but building an AI to have it's own opinions and motivations is a little "creepy" and "dangerous". How could you ever trust it? The Sentient Android is a "Ninotchka" a dry-humor cold war frenemy. She's from a union of star systems governed by AI. Under rigid management, they are approaching post-scarcity but they converted all habitable planets to farm-only clean worlds and moved humans to climate controlled space habitats. From the Navy's POV, she represents an ideology where humans have surrendered to machines in exchange for safety and comfort. These sentient AI are their next-generation. Her abilities are unknown. The Pirate has exposed weaknesses in the local proxy government which is collapsing. In the ensuing power vacuum he has elevated his Robin Hood status to a potential warlord who can fight back against space colonialism. His reputation is rapidly changing from intergalactic criminal to freedom fighter. Navy brass is looking for a surgical solution, not an escalation of conflict. 

One theory of human brain development is based on Social Intelligence. As humans began living in larger social groups (tribes and clans) our brains doubled in size to track these complex relationships. My sister's husband is off limits, but I can date my sister's husband's brother. My father's enemy's son is my enemy.... We have complex social rules which are fundamental to us, but really have no purpose in nature so it wouldn't evolve directly. Instead, as the theory goes, we needed to keep track of who was who in the "in circle" around the various alpha positions and their families in society. If your family is close to the king this actually does impact your genetics, over and over in numerous ways. Children of the king's friends get married and you have an aristocracy â€“ tracking a royal heir can sometimes be a societal obsession, and even in social animals the children of alpha females are treated better because of nepotism (nepotism literally means "nephew-ism"). Scheming men and women breed with the powerful, and they have powerful scheming children. This consolidates to an evolution of social intelligence that has nothing to do with mechanical engineering or scientific observation. It might however be related to language skills, persuasiveness, charisma. It also might explain cult leaders and narcissists who exploit a kind of social control over people even when it seems to defy logic. How much of today's telecommunications and broadcast media is simply about the relationships of status individuals in society? So if your critters have a strict social pecking order with lots of complicated rules they are expected to follow, they could be a society of backstabbing power-climbing schemers who are savvy and manipulative without necessarily being hammer and screwdriver intelligent. 

People can, through sign language, express anything that can be expressed through spoken language so far as I know. So gestures can be fully expressive (there's enough "gesture-space" to build a language). Sign language, though, is derived from that spoken language, because it was developed to allow the hearing-impaired to converse with speakers. Sign language uses gestures mainly at the "word" level and the occasional phrase, though finger-spelling allow allows a signer to convey letters. What would a gesture-based language look like if it developed organically in a civilization of people who do not speak and hear? For the sake of this question, assume that -- as with speech -- the gesture language develops well in advance of a written form (if a written form even develops at all): we have a civilization of people with no written or spoken language but they use gestures to communicate with each other. Would the building blocks of the language still be words and grammar, or should we expect to see something very different develop (a la the analogy-based language of Darmok, though that specific example isn't feasible so please don't focus on that)? 

Improve the plow and related technologies. Everybody needs to eat. By the time you're talking about, western Europe already had the heavy plow, but plowing was hard, slow work. Plow technology didn't change much for several centuries, after which improvements to lighten the plow and improve its metallurgy were developed. If you arrive toward the beginning of your time range, you can also increase agricultural efficiency by introducing the horse collar (h/t Deolater). And you can further improve agriculture (no matter when you arrive) by introducing better irrigation techniques. A time traveller who brings those designs (and metallurgy information) with him could offer a medieval king more, better, faster food production for his people. Even a king who doesn't care much about feeding his people (hey, he's got his) should still be interested in the time savings that allows those people to do additional work. Medieval farming was not a path to wealth, so those people aren't likely to just sit around doing nothing the rest of the time. More military levies, anybody? I focused on agriculture here because it's at the core of food production during this time period. As noted in comments, other food-related improvements are also possible, including the beehive (h/t Draco18s) and bringing back modern or more-varied seeds. 

30 years is not enough time. Rare minerals and precious metals do not become cheaper through mass-manufacture. No matter when your industrial revolution started, there is very little palladium on the Earth, some investors estimate less than 14 million ounces (very roughly: >400 US tons) has ever been mined. As it's uses become known it rises in value. I have not found an article that revealed how much palladium is required in palladium glass, but I suspect you will either need to compromise on your metal ingredients or find a completely new way of making palladium, like synthesizing it through nuclear fission. 

There are several problems with your visualization of this moon, especially concerning the day/night cycle. I think you are confusing some research about tidally locked planets with tidally locked moons. The moon shows one face to its planet, but from the moon's point of view the heavens still rotate and the sun rises and sets. Wikipedia has an entry for habitable moons that discusses possible orbital periods around the planet between 10 and 60 days, but likely under 45. This is the length of your moon's "day". The shorter your day, the larger the planet will be in the sky because you are closer to it. The same entry also discusses tidal forces potentially being a stronger factor in mantaining a living planet than proximity to the sun. The larger the planet the larger it's tidal zone will be, but it might be almost any distance from the sun so you can safely put it around 1AU. By definition of it being a moon, the majority of tidal forces will come from the planet, but the sun could play a small role. Rather than a "night" and "day" side, there would be a "planet" and "space" side. Even directly under the planet, it would be large but would not fill the sky. The planet would wax and wane like our moon in the sky, but it would not progress across the sky. It would always be in the same position day and night. Some nights would have a spectacularly bright "full planet" depending on the albedo of your planet. Some days would have an enormous sliver of the planet in an otherwise blue* sky (or whatever color your sky is).
