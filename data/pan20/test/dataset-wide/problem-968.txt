I personally wouldn't consider that the dividing line between night and day. I consider night to be the period between dusk and dawn rather than sunset and sunrise. One doesn't need to stop playing a ball game on an unlit field just because the Sun has set. There's still another twenty to forty minutes of light from the blue sky. Dusk and dawn last the shortest in the tropics, with civil twilight (e.g., the period when one can continue playing a ball game on an unlit field) generally considered to be the 24 minute period prior to sunrise / after sunset in the tropics. With this, "nighttime" comprises about 47% of the time in the tropics. The question however asks about the period between sunset and sunrise. Even on an airless planet, "nighttime" by this definition will comprise a bit less than half the time at the equator because sunrise and sunset occur when the top of the Sun appears above / drops below the horizon. Since the Sun's angular diameter is about 32 arc minutes, on average, this alone means that daytime is about two minutes longer than nighttime+twilight at the equator. We don't live on an airless planet. Atmospheric refraction means that when we see the very top of the Sun at the horizon, the Sun is geometrically well below the horizon. This, coupled with the Sun's angular size, makes daytime last about 12 hours and 6 to 8 minutes at the equator, with very little variation over the course of a year. Taking 12 hours and 7 minutes as the average, daytime represents 50.5% of the time while twilight plus nighttime (or just night, per the question) represents the other 49.5% of the time. 

While there are many uses for Earth-centered, Earth-fixed coordinates, they're not particularly useful or meaningful in most human-centric endeavors, which happen on or near the surface of the Earth. Consider two points on the surface of the Earth, one at a distance of 6377.12 km from the center of the Earth, the other at 6359.59 km. At which location will you have to worry about altitude sickness? The answer is the one that is 17.53 km closer to the center of the Earth. The first location is Lake Asal in Africa, which is 155 meters below mean sea level. The second location is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, which is 2835 meters above mean sea level. Because those ECEF coordinates are not particularly useful or meaningful, the first thing a GPS receiver does after computing position in ECEF coordinates is to convert that position to latitude, longitude, and elevation above a reference ellipsoid. There's an issue with this, which is the use of a reference ellipsoid. Some places at sea level have an elevation of 85 meters above the reference ellipsoid, others as much as 107 meters below the reference ellipsoid. While there certainly are challenges in the concept of mean sea level, it remains extremely useful. It tells us, for example, which parts of New Orleans are subject to coastal flooding, which parts of Fargo are subject to springtime flooding, and which parts of Colorado are subject to altitude sickness. 

I mentioned sailing ships. People have been aware of how the winds blow locally since sailing started. People probably started sailing before they started writing. The Portuguese discovered the importance of the trade winds before Columbus sailed to the Americas. So far I've only written about winds near the surface. The winds are different well above the surface. There are jet streams at the boundaries between where the trade winds and prevailing westerlies flow and at the boundaries of the polar cells. The Japanese discovered these jet streams during World War II and used this to their advantage. They launched fire balloons from near Tokyo to drop a bomb on the US about three days later. Nowadays, we use the jet streams for more peaceful purposes. 

As noted above, a geoid is not needed. Modern models of the geoid are calculated from those same spherical harmonic coefficients (plus Earth rotation) that used needed to calculate the gravitational acceleration and gravity. 

There's no contradiction. Firn is an intermediate form between snow and ice, with a density between that of snow and ice. The frozen fluffy stuff that falls from the sky -- that's not ice, it's not firn. It's snow. It's also not very dense, typically less than 0.5 grams/cm3. As the snow sits and gets compressed by snow atop it, some of the gas gets squeezed out. The snow changes from ice to firn. The authors are using density between 0.55 and 0.82 grams/cm3 as the definition of firn. As the firn sits even longer, it changes from firn to ice. Note that solid frozen water (no air pockets whatsoever) has a density of about 0.934 grams/cm3. Compressed former snow with a density of 0.82 or higher acts a lot like ice. It is ice, not firn. 

By definition, El Niño and La Niña cannot occur at the same time. They are instead opposite extreme phases of the El Niño Southern Oscillation. El Niño conditions occur when the average temperature of the Niño 3.4 region is a half degree or more over the average for three consecutive months or more. La Niña conditions occur when the average temperature is a half degree or more below the average for three consecutive months or more. The reason for looking at a rather narrow band of the equatorial Pacific rather than looking at the Pacific as a whole is because of teleconnections. Whether El Niño, neutral, or La Niña conditions apply has wide ranging impacts across the globe. 

This heat engine, powered by a hundred kelvin temperature difference between the warm oceans and the top of the troposphere, does a very nice job of locally cooling the Earth. 

The forecasts issued by the National Hurricane Center are made by people. Those people use every single tool they have at hand. This includes forecasts made by automated tools such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (the "European model"). It also includes forecasts made by several other models. The human-generated forecasts account for the skills of those various models, for the ages of the forecasts made by those models, and for data that are not used by those models. When multiple models more or less agree, the human forecasters use techniques and their judgement to split the difference. There is no splitting the difference when models disagree massively, as currently is the case with Jose. The current forecast (advisory 20A at 0800 AST on 10 September 2017), depicted graphically below, appears to be exactly that made by the ECMRWF. 

First off, that's a conjecture regarding the origin of the Earth's water rather than a known fact. A few times a year or so, a new journal article will appear that argues that the Earth's water is primordial, then another arguing that it came from comets, then yet another arguing that it came from asteroids. If the Earth's water is mostly primordial, most of it is over 4.5 billion years old. If it came from asteroids or comets that collided with the Earth after the Earth had formed, it's still very, very old. Regardless of the source, almost all of the Earth's water has been here for at least 3.8 billion years old, since the end of the late heavy bombardment. The same would apply to Mars. It has had almost four billion years to lose its water. So has the Earth; some argue that the Earth, too, has lost a lot of water to space in those four billion years. The key causes of the disparity is that the Earth is significantly more massive and has a magnetic field. Mars's essentially non-existent magnetic field means that water molecules in the atmosphere are more readily split into hydrogen and oxygen than are water molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. Mars's smaller gravitational field means the hydrogen produced by these events has a much greater chance of escaping before it re-forms water than on the Earth. A very recent conjecture poses another possibility, which is that Mar's mantle is slightly different in composition than the Earth's, and this different composition enabled Mars's mantle rocks to absorb significantly more water than did the Earth's. 

First, a correction. Most climate scientists are climatologists rather than meteorologists. Climatology and meteorology, while related, are quite distinct sciences. Meteorologists and climatologists don't see eye to eye. The consensus amongst meteorologists regarding climate change is not nearly as strong as it is amongst climatologists. Many meteorologists still doubt human-driven climate change. One key issue is that meteorologists know that predicting the weather beyond a week or two is impossible thanks to the butterfly effect. This knowledge makes them rather skeptical of claims by climatologists regarding what will happen in 50 to 100 years. Climate is not weather, of course. That weather is not predictable beyond a week or two does not mean that climate is not predictable. The same cannot be said regarding geologists. They take a long view of things, arguably longer even than that taken by climatologists. The consensus amongst geologists is quite strong. The Geology Society (British) issued a strong statement regarding climate change in 2010 (Climate change: evidence from the geological record) and made this even stronger with an adddendum in 2013. The Geological Society of America conducted informal surveys of its members at annual meetings in 2009 and 2011 (GSA members on climate change: Where, what, and ways forward?) The consensus was quite strong. Of the 181 members who were surveyed, only two "clearly stated they do not believe anything will occur because climate change is not happening". This is in line with the 97% consensus amongst climatologists.
