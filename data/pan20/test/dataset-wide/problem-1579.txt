No, Hawking didn't deny the existence of black holes. Hawking said that, in light of new understanding, the previous definition of black holes wasn't strictly accurate and proposed a better definition to describe the same entities. He wasn't denying that the entities known as black holes existed. (1) : 

Summary: Since 1963's withdrawal of the Dutch colonial administration, the Free Papua Movement (OPM) has conducted a low-level guerilla war against Indonesia, targeting its military and police, and kidnapping non-Papuan Indonesian settlers and foreigners More evidence: 

Holmes credibility doubted Holmes's credibility has been seriously doubted (2) (3) by a researcher named Loren Coleman. Coleman noted on Cryptomundo, web site devoted to mysterious creatures, that Holmes has a history of reporting sightings of odd and unusual creatures like cryptozoological creatures, and sells a self-published book and DVD claiming evidence for the existence of fairies. Take a look at this example, Holmes tells us he’s filmed fairies: 

But we can estimate: So, 1989 + 2 years == 1991 or 1992 which seem pretty close to the time of death date by Window Public Library: Jan 7, 1993. So, is that enough to prove that he died? Not necessarily, you have to remain skeptical; even if I provide you with a death certificate, it is well known that the guy has been a KBG spy with a fake name, which makes a faked death possible. 

Proof from independent sources The Library of Congress confirms that this is the legal of Taio Cruz: 

Below are points of evidence supporting the fact that sharks are a threat to undersea cables. EVIDENCE 1: The first report of sharks attacking cables came from the Canary Islands in 1985, when sharks' teeth were found embedded in an experimental cable. I found the report in an old news paper. 

As for Public Policy Polling (PPP), it can be considered as accurate since a Fordham University report released ranked the firm first among 28 organizations for the accuracy of its final, national estimates. It also a great track record and history in being accurate. 

The following has been mentioned a paper study (1) published in 2006, four years before Clifford's book was released: 

Definition: Foot fetishism, foot partialism, foot worship, or podophilia is a pronounced sexual interest in feet. For a foot fetishist, points of attraction include the shape and size of the foot and toes (e.g., long toes, short toes, polished toenails, high arches, soles etc.), jewelry (toe rings, ankle bracelets, etc.), treatments (such as pedicures or massaging), state of dress (barefoot, flip flops, etc.), odor, and/or sensory interaction (e.g., smelling the foot, licking, kissing, tickling, etc.) Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran said in Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind:

But, it has been warned not to use on burns by Truven Health Micromedex, the official producer of the drug, information delivered by website drugs.com: 

Treasury of Scripture Knowledge made a similar analysis to the claim in the question.. The author of the claim could have been inspired by the analysis of Genesis 34:12, but we can never know unless the author makes a statement. Conclusion: Apparently, this seems to be a made up example, but it is an example based on real traditions from the Old Testament (see Genesis 34:12 and Treasury of Scripture Knowledge's analysis). The spirit of author of the claim's argument is correct, marriage was about dowry, but it seems the claim is an example made to create rhetorical effects. (1) Goody, Jack (1976).

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit it is. On other surverys/studies, you may find different results. The Economist Intelligence Unit has an Worldwide Cost of Living ranking which is based on price data that are adjusted for recent exchange-rate movements. In 2015, they have listed the top-ten locations surveyed: 

It's quite the opposite. Tomatoes are associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer. You might want to look at this peer-reviewed study, it was carried out by researchers from the University of Bristol, the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Bristol Nutrition Biomedical Research Unit, Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and the University of Oxford and funded by the NIHR and Cancer Research UK. The large and huge study showed that there is a clear association between the consumption of more than 10 portions of tomatoes per week and an 18% reduction in risk of prostate cancer. Vanessa Er, from the School of Social and Community Medicine at Bristol University, even said it with her own words: 

This data was used by an African organization africacheck.org when trying to estimate the number of malaria deaths in children under 5 in Africa: 

Interesting, they mention a list of junk-food restaurants (or supermarkets) who list red in their logo as a proof that they Red makes you hungry. They also forget to mention restaurants that don't use red in their logos, like: 

One additional note, is that hotmail (renamed Outlook) today uses the word "Junk" instead of "Spam". 

Applying creams to minor burns as a first aid: Based on claims from authoritative medical websites, it is not recommended nor appropriate to apply any types of creams on burns. National Health Service (NHS), which is the largest and the oldest single-payer healthcare system in the world, mentioned on their website reported in a post: 

In other words, it says that tequila is the only alcoholic drink that's a stimulant, not a depressant. The problem with this claim is that: Tequila is most often made at a 38–40% alcohol content (76–80 proof), but can be produced between 31 and 55% alcohol content (62 and 110 proof). Tequila's active ingredient is ethanol and ethanol is a known central nervous system depressant. As opposed to stimulating your brain, ethanol instead depresses it, causing lowers inhibitions and of course pleasure. Furthermore, many people will argue that Tequila, a mix of alcohol and stimulants, has an overall effect which is not a depressant. This is FALSE. 

True or false? True. Source: Approximately 10-20% of subjects are able to maintain a weight loss of at least 5% after 5 years Another research: The results of other research also look grim; five years after completing structured weight loss programs, people only maintain a 3% weight loss. In-depth article I recommend. 

A study done (1) by Ciri Science, the Cleaning Industry Research Institute, sampled 47 public restrooms to test the presence of bacteria on various bathroom surfaces and found that women’s bathrooms are 4.5 times more likely to have Escherichia coli bacteria in them, and that men's bathrooms are cleaner: 

Results from this poll seem to be reliable. Public Policy Polling (PPP) who is a U.S. polling firm based in Raleigh, North Carolina released a PDF report listing the results of a national survey looking at common conspiracy theories. The exact question: 

Now they spoke about the masking effect only, but how do we know the alcohol will not have an overall effect of which is not depressant? In a post by the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, has announced that mixing energy drinks (stimulants with a lot of caffeine) with alcohol (depressant) can lead to “wide-awake drunkenness,” where caffeine masks the feeling of drunkenness but does not decrease actual alcohol-related impairment. Also, apparently there are no clinical studies supporting tequila as a stimulant and/or not depressant. In addition, one popular myth that persists to this day, tequila does contain mescaline. Tequila is a kind of mezcal, a distilled alcoholic beverage made from the maguey plant. Since mezcal's name is similar to mescaline, people probably thought tequila contained mescaline, and they thought mescaline is a stimulant (there is a controversy about this also). Despite the similar name, mezcal does not contain mescaline. Conclusion: While tequila is made from a different plant than alcohols, it still has between 31% and 55% of alcohol. And the fact that it has between 31% and 55% of alcohol (and the possible lack of clinical studies supporting Tequila as a stimulant), it is enough to disprove that myth. At very low doses, and for certain people, it can appear as a stimulant since it suppresses certain inhibitions, but it's not, like all alcohols, it depresses the central nervous system.. 

After this message has gone viral online: circulated on social media and people's emails; the Mayo Clinic, on behalf of Dr. Somers, exposed the falseness of this circulating email, and they said:

You will also find Facebook images where they mock news articles for falling for their fake news. (1) El Manchar said that the guy is seeking "20 millions de centimes" of damage. It is referring to centimes of dirham. 20 million of centimes of MAD is equal to 200,000 MAD (Morrocan Dirham). 200,000.00 MAD = 20,307.06 USD
