The answer, as others have said, is "both." However, if you are only going to use one light, there is a disadvantage to that one light being helmet-mounted. When the light is mounted close to the eye, everything that is illuminated is "flattened" since, from the eye's perspective, there are no shadows to provide information about depth. In particular, it's harder to see potholes or other road imperfections. That's why randonneurs often mount a light on the front fork near the hub -- the distance between the light source and the eye helps highlight the road surface. A second issue arises in fog or rain: in that case, with a helmet light you'll get reflections directly back into your eye. That's why you don't use "high" beams when driving your car in foggy conditions, and why fog lights are mounted low. Given these reasons, a helmet-mounted light can be an excellent supplement but shouldn't be used as one's only light unless you are riding only in urban areas where you can rely on additional street lights to keep the road surface well-illuminated. 

Cycling is an aerobic sport and for any sustained effort you are limited by oxygen delivery and conversion. Meanwhile, heart rate is just a measurement of how fast your heart is beating -- the other missing component of oxygen delivery is "stroke volume"; and then you still have to get from the delivery system to power production. Stroke volume is determined in part by the size of your heart's ventricles as well as the "ejection fraction" (specifically for aerobic production of power, the left ventricle and left ventricle ejection fraction). Decreasing your heart rate, in and of itself, will not allow you to produce more power. Cycling training will tend both to increase stroke volume and to increase the mitochondria you use to produce power aerobically. At 67kg and 1.73m, climbing 2600 ft in 8.5 miles in 55+ minutes means you were probably producing in the ballpark of 3.0 - 3.25 watts/kg. The way to improve your time is to improve your power, not to decrease your heart rate. Indeed, it doesn't make much sense to compare your HR to that of others since there is a great deal of variation across individuals in their power:HR ratio. Two riders with the same HR can produce very different power output; two riders with the same power output might have very different HR. For hillclimbs, the ratio you want to focus on is watts/kg of body weight. Since it appears your BMI (at 22+) is relatively low, you'll want to improve the numerator. (For flat races, aerodynamic resistance is the greatest source of drag so the ratio you want to improve is watts/(sq. meters of drag area)). 

To a racer, rolling resistance and handling top the list; durability is far down the list. The coefficient of rolling resistance (Crr) for a racing tire on typical French or Italian roads used during a Grand Tour is about .004, or even lower. The Crr of a puncture resistant tire can be > .01. Crr scales like gradient, so the difference between Crr's of .01 and .004 is like constantly climbing a slope of .006 (=.01 - .004), or slightly more than half a percent. On a 150km stage that's like climbing an extra 900m hill. No racer willingly gives up that much advantage, especially when there's wheel support from either a team car or neutral support should you get a flat. 

The equation for total aerodynamic drag force on a bicycle is well-understood and, you're right, air density has a role in it: the higher the density, the greater the drag. As you guessed, density decreases with increasing temperature so warm air is less dense than cold air. It's also probably no surprise that density decreases with pressure. However, evidently counter-intuitively, humid air is less dense than dry air. The simplest explanation is that water molecules contain two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom so they have a molecular mass of 18 g/mol, while dry air has a molecular mass of around 29 g/mol. You can check the wikipedia page on air density for more details. 

The short and most direct answer to your question is to use your power meter to pace your ride optimally and Alex Simmons, who has given another answer to your question, was too modest to mention that he is an expert in this and has developed one of the most sophisticated power pacing models for variable conditions. A longer answer is, to paraphrase Prof. Jim Martin at the University of Utah, cycling fast is about maximizing the power you can make, and minimizing the power you must make. You can use a power meter to address both of these. Obviously, you can use a power meter to train so that you can maximize the power you can make. I will presume that you are already familiar with some of the training methods. Less well-known is that you can use a power meter to identify and estimate the sources of drag and inefficiencies that consume power so that you can (sometimes) minimize them. Proper pacing is in this category, as optimal pacing can help you get lower overall times on the same overall energy expenditure. In addition, you may be able to use a power meter to estimate rolling resistance losses either in your tires/tubes or drive train to make better choices about equipment. Rolling resistance from your tires and tubes scales exactly like hill slope, so a decrease (or increase) of .001 in your coefficient of rolling resistance (Crr) is exactly like decreasing (or increasing) your slope by .001, or 0.1%. This may sound small but in a race where seconds matter the difference between winning and finishing off the podium can be smaller than the difference between racing up a hill with an average slope of 8.1% and 8.2%. Your speed on this particular hillclimb is low but on other hills your speed may be high enough to warrant looking at aerodyanmic drag, which you can also estimate with appropriate field tests using an accurate and precise power meter. And, although not strictly something that requires a power meter, you can use speed and cadence to estimate gear usage throughout your climb to see not only which gears you used but also when you changed gears. You can see an example of how that is done here, which is an analysis of power, cadence, crank torque, and gear usage during a hill climb. For example, here is the gear usage during this 15-minute long hill climb race, with dotted red lines marking 30-second long intervals, which are numbered in red: 

There is a small part of the KE component due to moment of inertia in the wheels but for bicycles that tends to be small and we often ignore it. However, the equations needed to describe the rolling resistance and aerodynamic resistance are a bit more complicated. The article by Martin et al., cited above, gives more detail but if we can ignore wind then the aerodynamic component simplifies to 

Unless you ride or race a fixed-gear or single-speed bike, the leg strength needed by a cyclist who rides a geared bike is actually quite moderate. In a physiological context strength is defined as the maximum force that you are able to produce, which occurs at close to the point when your muscles are stationary. Even most otherwise healthy non-athletes can leg press around 1.4x their weight at "1RM" (for "one rep max"). On a geared bicycle when you're not trying to sprint away from a dead stop typical pedal forces are closer to the equivalent of around 20% of body weight, way below 1RM. Occasionally, when in a standing start, riders will apply up to 1.2x their body weight on the pedals (this obviously requires pulling up on the handlebars) but this is not sustainable for more than a few pedal strokes. Thus, unless you are recovering from injury or have some other obvious motor skill issue, strength is rarely the limitation to improved cycling. Cycling is an aerobic endurance sport, which is why most professional cyclists more closely resemble ectomorphic marathoners than endomorphic weight lifters, and why doping with EPO (which increases oxygen transport) is more ergogenic than doping with anabolic steroids. The obvious exception is track sprinters, where the the intensity and short duration of the race select for cyclists who resemble their sprinter counterparts in track-and-field. See, for example, images of the legs of track sprinter Robert Forstemann. In general, the key to improved cycling is increased power, not increased strength per se. Power is the product of pedal force and pedal speed. The best strength training you can do to improve your cycling is to do many (many) repetitions at relatively high muscle contraction and flexion speeds at relatively low force. This is not the typical kind of strength training that one performs in a gym with weights -- the muscle speeds are too low and the force loads are too high. A better example of the appropriate speed/force range is interval training on your bike. Thus, most exercise physiologists (and a many cycling coaches) believe the best way to attain the leg strength and leg speed appropriate to bicycle riding is to train on your bike. To show that the strength demands of cycling are relatively modest, the panel plot below shows two extracts from a ride done by the same rider in the same day. The panels show the rider's speed, cadence, pedal force (in Newtons), and power. On the left side of the plot, in the black dots, is the acceleration away from a stop light, from 0 up to about 30 km/h; on the right side, in red, is an acceleration later in the same ride from about 30 km/h to 60 km/h. 

I believe you are asking two different questions: the first, how to use Coggan's Power Profile; and the second, given power at one duration, how to extrapolate and predict power at other durations. But first, an historical aside: Coggan's Power Profiles pre-date the publication of his book with Hunter Allen so really should be thought of as Coggan's own. The Power Profile is an empirical summary: the top of each column is pegged to a "world-class" effort, the bottom of each column is pegged to a typical effort for an "untrained" but non-sedentary adult of normal health and fitness, and the range between the two were split into 40 equal-sized steps. The reason it was done this way is because Coggan lacked actual observed data on the true distribution of watts/kg in the population; he knew the top (="world-class" or "world-record") and he had a reasonable idea of the bottom but he didn't have a histogram of the actual percentages at each value of watts/kg in between. Importantly, the "category labels" were always considered to be just a labeling device to help readers understand the approximate levels -- Coggan had no specific data to support their semi-arbitrary assignment. In fact, in an early revision of the Power Profile Coggan removed the "category labels" because he felt that readers were mis-using them. There was great hue-and-cry and promises of good behavior and intelligent usage so he subsequently replaced the labels, though making them "overlap" rather than have sharp boundaries between categories as in his first edition. This is all preface to Coggan's intended and widely stated use of the Power Profiles: to identify relative strengths and weaknesses in a given rider's power. He intended that riders circle or highlight their watts/kg in each column, draw a connecting line between the highlighted values, then ignore the actual values and just look at the pattern described by the line. If the line sloped downward from left to right, it meant the rider was relatively stronger at short durations than at long, and either should work on "bringing up the right" or else exploit his (or, in later editions of the Profiles, her) skills as a sprinter. If the line was relatively flat, the rider was an "all-rounder." Importantly, the line was based on "best" efforts at those durations which would not typically occur during the course of a single ride but rather be pieced together from specific efforts from several rides. All of the modern cycling analytical software products can "extract" the best 5 second, 1 minute, 5 minute, and 1 hour efforts from your data. Some products can do so for any arbitrary length of time, for example 495 seconds. So the bottom line for the first part of your question is that if you climbed a hill at 3.23 watts/kg for 8 minutes 15 seconds, you shouldn't use the Power Profile as a way to predict your power at other durations. The Power Profile wasn't meant for that purpose. Which brings us to the second question: how, then, would one go about predicting power at different durations given power at one duration? This is a very common question but a full answer is complicated. That said, a simple answer (and the one that Coggan himself might advise) is to go out and ride a different duration and see what you can do. The full answer from a modeling point of view is complicated because we have mainly two different "energy production pathways" to help us produce power (commonly though inexactly) called the "aerobic" and "anaerobic" systems, and we each fatigue and renew at different rates. Therefore, you would need several parameters in order to characterize a particular individual's power-duration curve, and there would be some (potentially, a lot of) error in the estimation. In short, at a minimum, you would need estimates of the parameters for "anaerobic" capacity, "aerobic" capacity, the actual work over time that caused fatigue, and for recovery from fatigue. Coggan has recently hinted at what may be an empirical, non-modeling, approach. He has recently claimed that if given an estimate of a rider's FTP (functional threshold power) he can produce an estimate to within 5% of the rider's steady-state power at durations from 2 minutes on up. 

There are (at least) two reasons. First, most (but not all) E-bikes use a control system that multiplies the amount of force or torque that you put into the pedals or cranks. Since power is the product of pedal speed and pedal force (or torque), increasing the torque allows the rider to reduce the pedal speed -- that is, the rider's cadence. Electric motors (can) produce full torque at any rpm, so these controllers typically modulate the torque output rather than the rpm. Second, if a rider on an E-bike were riding at "normal" cadence for his or her speed you would be less likely to notice the rider, so your observational sample is likely to be more heavily weighted to those with lower than normal cadence.
