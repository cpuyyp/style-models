Fairly sure this is standard bookwork if you are talking about a PMS star on the Hayashi track. Differentiate your GPE wrt time, assuming that the mass is constant. Take half of this as the luminosity (via the virial theorem). This gives $L$ in terms of $dR/dt$. Then if you are on the Hayashi track you can assume surface temperature $T$ is constant and Stefan's law gives you $dR/dt$ in terms of $L$, $T$ and $dL/dt$. Substitute that in and integrate the resulting differential equation to get $L(t)$. Using this approach, I managed to get $$ L = \left(\frac{\alpha GM^2}{6}\right)^{2/3} \left(4\pi \sigma T^4\right)^{1/3} t^{-2/3},$$ where $T$ is the temperature of the Hayashi track in question. If you don't want to make the Hayashi track assumption, you can say that $L = AM^B T^C$ defines tracks in the HR diagram and this can be used in addition to Stefan's law to eliminate $dT/dt$ and give your result in terms of constants $A$, $B$, $C$. These can come from polytropic theory or by fitting the $L,M,T$ function to numerical calculations. (E.g. see Jackson & Jeffries 2014 $URL$ ). 

This is a very broad question: its answer involves the full details of stellar evolution, Galactic chemical evolution and nuclear physics. I'll limit myself to the following observations: 

The solution to your mystery about why habitable planets are found around nearby low-mass stars, but distant G/K stars is all to do with observational selection effects and biases. There are many G/K stars within 100 light years of the Sun, but almost none have been examined in the detail required to reveal small, habitable planets around them. Almost all the small "Earthlike" planets in habitable zones have been found by the transit technique. It is much easier to find such planets around small stars for two reasons: The transit technique yields a signal that depends on $(R_p/R_{*})^2$. Thus small planet transits are easier to see around small stars. The probability of a transit depends on the ratio of the star size to orbital radius. This sounds like it works against finding planets around small stars; and it does at a fixed orbital radius. But, because the habitable zone is much closer-in to a smaller, less luminous star, then the habitable planets around such stars are more likely to transit. In addition, their orbital periods will be tens of days rather than the months to a year around G/K stars and this makes it much easier to observe repeated transits. In fact, the combination of these two selection effects makes it possible to find habitable zone planets around small stars all over the sky from ground-based observatories. The downside is that small stars are low luminosity, so the planets that can be found are found around nearby examples at tens of light years. In contrast, habitable zone planets around G/K stars are mostly found in months-year orbits by Kepler, which stared at a single small field for 4 years. The majority of the stars targeted by Kepler for exoplanet searches were 10th-15th magnitude G/K stars (there are few brighter examples in such a limited patch of sky), which are at distances of hundreds to thousands of light years. 

The luminosity evolution of Trappist-1, assuming a mass of $0.08M_{\odot}$ and the models of Baraffe et al. (2015). The horizontal dashed line marks the best estimate of its current luminosity, for which planets e-g are said to be in the HZ. If we go back in time, the rightmost vertical dashed line marks the age below which the luminosity increases to the point that e becomes too hot to be habitable. Then further back, the leftmost vertical dashed line marks the point where all the currently known planets (b-h) become uninhabitable. So the answer to your question is quite uncertain and depends critically on the age of Trappist-1 now and of course whether the planets were always at the orbital radii they are now$^{*}$. As you can see from the plot above (note the logarithmic scale on the x-axis), the luminosity evolution referred to above takes place early-on. If Trappist-1 could be as young as 500 million years, then life on planet e may only have been possible for 300 million years. However, if the star is slightly more massive and is 10 billion years old, then life has had 9.8 billion years to get going. If you are talking about planet f, then it has had slightly longer ($\sim +100$ million years) inside the HZ, and planet g slightly longer ($\sim +70$ million years) again. Planet h will have spent comparatively little time (in the past), less than a few hundred million years, inside the HZ. $^{*}$ The abstract of the discovery paper by Gillon et al. (2017) briefly discusses the possibility that the planets migrated inwards after formation, through a process of "disc-driven migration". If so, then this will not alter the discussion above. Disc around very low-mass stars may be longer-lived than those around higher mass stars, but have essentially dispersed after $\sim 10-20$ million years (Kennedy & Kenyon 2009; Dawson et al. 2013; Binks & Jeffries 2017), and the planetary configuration would have to be settled where it is now by the time the disc has gone. 

Both spectra you show clearly have real features. There are perturbations in the spectra at certain wavelengths that are far larger than the rms noise that can be assessed empirically (by eye, or calculation) from looking at other parts of the spectrum. This would form that basis of an empirical test for the reality of spectral features. On the other hand, if your spectrum was full of (small) real features, then you would have to rely on a theoretical estimate of what the rms noise in your spectrum should be. Either way, your questions as posed cannot really be answered in any detail. If you have a spectrum that is consistent with being featureless, there will be some amplitude of real feature below which it would be undetectable. This amplitude upper limit will increase as the signal-to-noise decreases - i.e. the better your data, the smaller the features you can rule out. In the end, you can never be sure that you have a "featureless continuum", only that any features are smaller than some threshold, that must be established by calculation or simulation. 

What you are describing is a basic signal processing problem. The doppler shift that one observes is due to the motion of the star in the system around the system's centre of mass. The star will be influenced by the gravitational pull of each of the planets in that system, each of which exerts a gravitational pull that increases with the mass of the planet and decreases with the orbital radius of the planet. The overall motion of the star will be the sum of the effects of all the planets. Importantly, the effect of each planet will have its own amplitude and will be periodic with a period equal to the orbital period of that planet. Let's imagine that each planet is in a circular orbit (elliptical orbits are more complicated, but the principle is the same). Each planet would cause a circular motion in the star about the centre of mass of the planet-star pair, leading to an observable doppler signal which has the form of a sine wave with a period equal to the orbital period of the planet. The amplitude of that signal will increase with the mass of the planet and increases with decreasing orbital radius. The overall signal is the sum over all the planets in the system. Fortunately the decomposition of this signal back into its individual components is a well-trodden problem in physics, electronics and many other fields and is known as Fourier Analysis. Whether you can successfully recover the original signals from each of the planets depends on how long you observed the system (ideally you want to observe for longer than the longest orbital period) and the amplitude of the signals compared with the noise in your observations. In general it is easier to recover high-mass planets with short orbital periods and more difficult to recover low-mass planets with long orbital periods. The image below might be helpful. It shows the track of the solar system centre of mass compared with centre of the Sun over a period of several decades. Notice how the Sun executes a complex trajectory (with respect to the solar system centre of mass) that is mainly caused by the orbit of Jupiter, but then there are smaller, superimposed, signals caused by the smaller planets. In principle, if you observed for longer than the period of Neptune and had a detector which gave perfect measurements, you could reconstruct how many planets there were in the solar system, what their orbital periods were (and then from Kepler's 3rd law, what the planet-star sepration was) and what their masses were (multiplied by the inclination of their orbits with respect to the line of sight of observation, which is generally an unknown in doppler measurements). 

My career path:3-year Bachelor's degree in "Physics with Astrophysics"; PhD in X-ray astronomy; 5-years as a postdoctoral research assistant (two separate posts); got a lectureship at a UK university doing teaching and research in Physics and Astrophysics. This is reasonably typical. These days, the content of the first degree is not so important - Physics, Astrophysics, Applied Maths all would be ok. "Astronomy" would put you at a disadvantage, since the implication is a non-physical, observational approach; but you would have to look at the course content. A masters degree or 4-year first degree is usually necessary to get onto PhD programmes in the best places (this has changed since my day). Doing your PhD quickly and writing several publications is usually necessary to proceed any further. The normal next step is to get a postdoctoral position; preferably somewhere other than your PhD institute. Then after 2-3 years of producing more research papers (2-3 per year), you could try for personal research fellowships. If you can get one of these, or perhaps a second/third postdoc position, and your research is going well and is productive, then there is a few year window in which to get into a tenured or tenure-track position. Getting some teaching experience at this stage is probably important. For someone on a "normal" career path, it would be unusual to get a University position before the age of 30 (i.e. 8-9 years after your first degree). The large majority of people with a PhD in Astrophysics do not end up doing that for a living. 

Here is the very study you are looking for by Bailer-Jones (2014). Using the re-reduction of the Hipparcos astrometry, he has integrated orbits for 50,000 stars to look for objects that might come or might have come close to the Sun. The K-dwarf Hip 85605 is the winner on that timescale, with a "90% probability of coming between 0.04 and 0.20pc between 240,000 and 470,000 years from now". The next best is GL710 a K-dwarf that will come within about 0.1-0.44pc in 1.3 million years. On a statistical basis, some work has been done by Garcia Sanchez et al. (2001). They estimate, using the Hipparcos data, that encounters within 1pc occur every 2.3 million years. However, the Hipparcos data isn't complete for low-mass, faint objects. Making a correction for this, the authors estimate a $<1pc$ encounter every 100,000 years. The probability for closer approaches scales as the inverse of the square of the separation. i.e. the timescales for approaches closer than 0.1pc is 100 times longer. There are plenty of big error bars in all this work - recall that an error of 1km/s in velocity leads to a 1pc error in position after 1 million years. All this should be nailed down really well by Gaia results in the next 2-3 years. 

Your question is not very well defined since you don't say what observational properties you wish to compare. From your emphasis on distance, I assume that you want to compare the visual appearance of elliptical galaxies with globular clusters of the same angular extent on the sky. In which case ellipticals and globulars are easily distinguishable with the aid of a telescope (I assume you do not mean naked eye objects, since the nature of globular clusters is pretty difficult to make out with the naked eye, but if you do mean that then of course most smudges on the sky are indistinguishable with the naked eye). The reason for this is that true elliptical galaxies contain factors of $\sim 10^4$ more stars than even the most massive globular clusters and are about 100 times the physical diameter. Thus, if they had the same angular extent, an elliptical galaxy be $\sim 100$ times further away, would look much smoother and less grainy than a globular cluster, because it contains $10^4$ times more stars per unit area, but would have around the same surface brightness. Of course there are such things as dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but here the problem is the other way around. They have about the same number of stars as globular clusters, but have diameters a factor of 100 larger. Thus if they had the same angular extent they would look similar to a globular cluster in terms of "graininess", but since they would be 100 times further away, they would be $10^4$ times fainter! 

Although black holes are widely believed to emit Hawking radiation, it should be stressed that it has not actually been observed (yet?). The Hawking radiation should consist of electromagnetic radiation/waves that have a near-perfect black body spectrum, which is at a temperature that is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole - the smaller the black hole, the higher the temperature. The radiation is caused because "vacuum" is not empty when considered in quantum mechanics. Particle/anti=particle pairs are created for brief moments of time, before they annihilate again. Close to the event horizon of a black hole, it is possible that one particles from a virtual particle pair travels within the event horizon of the black hole and cannot escape to annihilate with its anti-particle. In principle, these particle/anti-particle pairs could be any types of particle, but in practice they are more likely to be the lightest particles. The lightest charged particles are electron/positron pairs, since these need to "borrow" less energy from the vacuum to be created. I do not think it is essential for one of the pair to disappear, since "Unruh radiation", a close relation of Hawking radiation should also be seen whenever there is acceleration with respect to the vacuum. To stay out of the black hole event horizon the particles must be accelerating. Accelerating charged particles locally emit electromagnetic radiation, which is then gravitationally redshifted when seen by an observer a long way from the black hole. It turns out that to be in a thermal equilibrium, the radiation must have a blackbody spectrum form. The temperatures and amount of radiation emitted are very small for stellar-sized black holes. The temperature of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole is given by $$ T = \frac{6.2\times 10^{-8}}{M}\ K,$$ where the mass $M$ is in solar maases. The power emitted by a black hole as Hawking radiation is $$ P = \frac{9\times 10^{-29}}{M^2}\ W$$ 

Yes, there should be dark matter within the Earth, but at very low densities - a few $10^{-22}$ kg/m$^3$ (Bovy & Tremaine 2012), something like one hundredth of the density of the interplanetary medium. The whole of the Earth would contain few hundred grammes! Of course, this density averaged over a sphere a lot larger than the Galaxy adds up to a lot of mass, but unlike luminous matter, dark matter should not be particularly concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (and observations of the dynamics of local stars confirm this). Neither do we expect dark matter to be especially concentrated within the Earth. Although it does interact gravitationally, the kinetic energy it receives from falling in to the Earth's gravitational potential will be exactly sufficient for it to escape again, unless it suffers some inelastic interaction inside the Earth. Some researchers do think that it may be possible that weak interactions may trap dark matter in the core of the Sun (e.g. Vincent et al. 2015) or even more likely, in neutron stars (Guver et al. 2012). But the Earth is not large or dense enough for this to be a likely scenario.
