I always bring black plastic sheets with me when going North in the Summer to make my bedroom pitch dark, but the local people seem to not be bothered by the Sun at night. However, they do say that they need less sleep, some say that they often can't sleep, get up at 2 am and start their work without being affected by sleep deprivation. Here we can read: 

I don't understand how this can work on the long term, it seems to me that a prolonged period of sleeping less will drain your energy levels. 

This is the article where the research results were published in. The double blind study was quite small, but the results were still significant. In other trials analogous results were found; if people have a larger expectation that a treatment will work, then the placebo effect will be stronger. E.g. in this study the effects of oxygen was compared to placebo oxygen in the treatment of high-altitude headache. It was found that the effect of the placebo oxygen was stronger, involving more biochemical pathways, if the patient had previously been given real oxygen. See also this article. 

As pointed out in the answers by Looft and Jan, we don't need to eat animal products to get all the amino acids we need. Here we must also consider the fact that the recommendations by the IoM regarding the diet are not scientifically rigorous to such a degree that you can take their RDA as a scientifically established fact. Doing so would necessarily require putting people on potentially deficient diets for a long period of time and studying the health outcomes. Such experiments would be unethical, this is why a cautious approach is chosen where we give the traditional Western diet the benefit of the doubt and demand a lot of evidence for alternative ideas This selective benefit of the doubt for the traditional Western diet makes the official RDA safe to use (relative to current eating habits), but it is not reliable when used in this question because it will biased against diets that will be lacking in some amino acids when there is no hard evidence that the RDA for such amino acids needs to be met for optimal health. A plant based diet may be superior to a Western diet containing animal products, many studies on plant based societies report on an almost total absence of heart disease. E.g. here it is pointed out that: 

One particular yoga method based on Tummo yoga and popularized by Wim Hof has been shown to have nontrivial medical effects, such as the ability to voluntarily influence the autonomous nervous system and the innate immune system. This method involves heavy breathing techniques (to the point of severe hyperventilation) and extreme cold exposure. A scientific explanation of why this method works, is given here (full video here). Whether modulating the immune system using such methods has useful medical applications is not clear yet. However, the method is very useful in preventing hypothermia when exposed to the cold, and it's also useful to lower the sensation of pain. 

This is too expensive for me, so I'll not submit my article there. But I'm also skeptical if the costs are really $5000. 

Similar studies have done in other such plant based populations with similar results. But here we have to note that people who live in such societies typically won't keep track of their amino acid intake, so they may actually get protein deficiencies from time to time. Nevertheless, they don't get heart disease. Autopsies on old people will not show any signs of atherosclerosis, while atherosclerosis already starts to affect our arteries at the age of ten. But absence of certain diseases doesn't prove that such a diet is healthier overall. A good test for the vegan diet would be studies were the protein demand is increased by letting people do heavy strength exercises and then studying the impact of a vegan diet relative to other diets. It's all good and well to point out that you can get enough of all the essential amino acids in theory, what matters is if you can demonstrate that you are able to stick to a diet that gives you all the required amino-acids on the long term. Such studies have not been performed. But what we can do is look at whether there are vegan bodybuilders and how competitive they are. The absence of vegans in that professions or if they all perform poorly would be a red flag for the vegan diet. It turns out that there are a number of vegan body builders, some like Frank Medrano supplement with protein powders while Patrik Baboumian manages to do with only vegetables, as he explains here. The most famous vegan bodybuilder is Jack Lalanne, but later in life he did start to eat egg whites and fish. So, we can say that there are no good reasons to believe that a vegan diet would lead to protein deficiencies in practice. My personal opinion for which I cannot find independent sources, is that doing a lot of exercise is important for getting enough nutrients from a vegan diet. A lot of the foods you eat in this diet have a low density in nutrients (not just protein, also minerals like calcium), so you must eat large volumes. E.g. I regularly eat 1 kg of potatoes and 500 grams of broccoli for dinner, which isn't all that difficult if you run for an hour a day at a fast pace. This meal alone contains almost all the amino acids I need. 

Electric cars also don't have differentials or a drive shaft. Instead, each wheel that's powered gets its own motor and torque is controlled by electronics. That's called "electronic differential". Here is how Wikipedia describes them: 

The link to the source of their data is dead, but it seems likely that 1 in 3.6 billion odds are lower than a whole lot of very unlikely causes of death (struck by lightning while drowning: 1 in 183 million). 

You can search the bill yourself for those amounts (that add up to well over 1/3 of the total $50 billion the bill allocated by the way) and read the details for yourself, but it appears that the funding is mostly disaster relief related. 

No. WP fact checked this and scored it 3 pinocchios WP did reach out to Cruz's staff for clarification on what does the senator consider "pork". Here is what they were told and their analysis on it: 

I traced the graph to this paper by Hsiang-Wen Hsu and Hsiang-Wen Hsua at University of Colorado Boulder. It was published in 2012 in American Journal of Physics. The paper is behind a paywall so I can not link to it, but I read it and it appears correct. The authors watched video from the Apollo Moon walks looking for certain frames in which dust was kicked up by the buggy. Using those frames they measured how high and how far the dust went - that's the blue squares on the plot. This is possible because they know the frame rate and resolution of the video footage. Using the wheel of the rover as an yard stick (16 inch wheel), they can convert pixel sized to meters. Time is also know from the frame rate. Using ballistic motion equations and accounting for linear drag they calculated 4 trajectories - 2 with Earth gravity (green dashed lines), 1 dust trajectory from the data they extracted from the video and 1 expected Moon trajectory using the actual moon gravitational constant. Here is the paper's summary: 

In US popular culture, it's often asserted that white people are more prone to commit certain types of crime that are "crazy", such as serial murder, child abduction, mass shooting, etc. This is often portrayed in movies, the most recent example being "Get Out" (which I saw last night): Here is a quote from the movie: 

Updated aluminum pharmacokinetics following infant exposures through diet and vaccination. The CDC gives 1.0 mg/kg/day as the Minimal Risk Levels for aluminum. Aluminum in vaccines in particular has been found to pose extremely low risk to infants. 

A lot of reputable news media outlets base those estimate on this site: $URL$ So it appears that the cost of the program was around $314 million, 20 bombs were delivered to the military thus the unit cost was ~ $16 million. It's not unusual for the first unit to have very high cost because of large capital investment (research, design, machines, etc) but the variable cost (how much it costs for materials & labor to build a bomb once you have all the facilities) to be fairly low. So the first bomb might be $200 million, the next 19 another 120 million, thus the average unit cost is $16 million and total program expenditure $320 million. If they build a 1000 more, the unit cost will probably go down. 

That definition was given in the 2004 rules for Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the definition used by some US courts (more info) More traditionally a combatant is someone taking part directly in an armed conflict. It seems very unlikely that any male over 15 would automatically be considered a combatant purely based on their sex and age. The claim seems to suggest that to be the case even when civilian targets were hit. This would violate a number of US and international laws and there are no evidence to that effect. 

The Washington Post fact checked this claim and scored in 2 (of 4) Pinocchios. While it's true that the number of Syrian Christian refugees admitted to the US is disproportionately lower, it's not clear why. The WP article lists the number of Syrian refugee for 2016 by religion as: 

It is possible to verify this idea from multiple sources that are independent of the U.S. Government. I'm going to leave verifying the exact numbers in the question out of scope of this answer, for reasons to be explained shortly, and stick to how you can verify from other sources the underlying claim being taken issue with: that the mass of the liquid is less than the mass of the gas. Some non U.S. Government sources for this are multiple textbooks on thermodynamics. The combustion of petrochemicals is, understandably, a well-documented process in science and engineering, and there are a lot of sources on this. I pick An introduction to thermodynamics by Y. V. C. Rao (Universities Press, 2004, ISBN 9788173714610) pretty much at random. Professor Rao teaches chemical engineering at IIT Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, and seems to have little connection to the U.S. government. In chapter 6 ("First Law Analysis of Processes") we can find several slightly indirect confirmations that this is indeed the physical process:In most of the combustion processes, the required oxygen is not supplied as pure oxygen but is supplied as air. […]An important parameter in the study of fuels is the air–fuel ratio, the ratio of the mass of the air to the mass of the fuel. […] One of the more basic ideas that we need to verify can also be found stated by Jeff Hartman, an author on motor vehicles from Austin, Texas. In Nitrous Oxide Performance Handbook (MotorBooks International, 2009, ISBN 9781616730529) on page 24 he says: Rao gives the actual chemical equations for such oxidization, and goes into detail about the purity of the fuel and some generalizations that descriptions of the process tend to make. For more, we turn to Associate Professor C. Lon Enloe at James Madison University, who tells us on page 13 of Physical Science: What the Technology Professional Needs to Know (John Wiley & Sons, 2001, ISBN 9780471360186) about an important physical principle: Let's go to Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering Gregory Nellis of the University of Wisconsin for another part of the whole. On page 854 of Thermodynamics (Cambridge University Press, 2011, ISBN 9781139498180) he tells us: So what the various professors have told us so far is that there is an underlying physical conservation principle, that there are two inputs (the reactants), and that the mass-energy of the the inputs must equal the mass-energy of the outputs. But you might challenge this on the principle that carbon dioxide is only one of the outputs, and that the conservation principle is the conservation of mass-energy not of mass alone. Maybe the mass of one of the other products is greater, and thus the mass of carbon dioxide is not necessarily greater than the mass of gasoline that has been burned. Maybe some of the mass turns to energy. Nellis deals with the latter. This is a chemical reaction, not a nuclear one. This leaves the possibility that the masses of the other products (water, carbon monoxide, and carbon, remember) are such that the mass of carbon dioxide alone is less than the mass of the gasoline. For this, let us turn to Professor of Mechanical Engineering Zellman Warhaft of Cornell University, who gives a more detailed introduction to the process in An Introduction to Thermal-Fluid Engineering: The Engine and the Atmosphere (Cambridge University Press, 1997, ISBN 9780521589277) that shows how the chemical equation that preserves atoms inevitably leads to this result, and that starts off with one of the assumptions that Rao calls out: A similar worked example, coming to the figure of 8.196kg of CO2 for 1 gallon of gasoline, is given by Professor Tom Holme of Iowa State University and Senior Lecturer Larry Brown of Texas A&M on page 132 of Chemistry for Engineering Students (Cengage Learning, 2005, ISBN 9780534389741). Why the discrepancy, though? These are not the U.S. government figure. The answer lies in the textbooks, again. Internal combustion is complex. There are entire books on this specific subject, after all. As Rao notes, these explanations make simplifying assumptions. They assume that gasoline is a pure substance. They assume complete combustion. In the real world, gasoline is, as Warhaft says, a mixture. Combustion is not complete. After all, one of the subjects that these textbooks go into is the notion of stoichiometric mass and the ideas of "rich" mixtures where there is too little air and not all of the gasoline burns, and "lean" mixtures where there is too much air. Rao again: And indeed Holme and Brown: So there is a set of assumptions, about how close one's gasoline is to the theoretical pure octane that the textbook calculations (explicitly) assume, and about how much fuel is actually burned in real automobiles, that can affect the answers. However, the underlying point, that the mass of the carbon dioxide is greater than the mass of the gasoline because mass-energy is conserved, there is another reactant in the reaction, and the chemical equation forces the ratios of reactants to products, is there in these and many other sources. Interestingly, your skepticism has been studied as one of the things that children do not initially understand about chemistry, and start off with the wrong mental models for. Graham Peacock of Sheffield Hallam University, John Sharp of Bishop Grosseteste University College, Rob Johnsey of the University of Warwick, Debbie Wright of the University of Plymouth, and Keira Sewell of Southampton University noted this in their book Primary Science: Knowledge and Understanding (Learning Matters, 2017, ISBN 9781526422736):a. much larger than the petrol?b. about the same as the mass of the petrol?c. much smaller than the petrol?Scientists would answer "a" as the process of burning fuel is constructive because the atoms of the fuel are combined with oxygen. It was found that many people believe (incorrectly) that the amount of exhaust will be smaller than the petrol. For what they are referring to, which itself cites further works and which again is yet another source for verifying the claim being disputed in the question, see pp. 82 et seq. of Michael Littledyke's, Liz Laikin's, and Keith Ross's book Science Knowledge and the Environment (2000, London: Fulton).
