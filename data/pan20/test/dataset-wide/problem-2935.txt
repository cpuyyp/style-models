If 5 is true, then how can 6 be true (Notice that 6 includes 'it's false that')? To wit: If you started before 6 and if the only other choice was to start at 5, then you must have started at 5? I symbolise 4-6: [4.1.] R ⟶ I would forget the shortcut. ⟶ ~Q. [5.1.] P ⟶ Q. [6.1.] ~(R ⟶ Q) 

If 2 is true, then how is 1 'not clear'? Does the author change his opinion about 1, in 3? 1 appears contradicted by 3. 

Why does Peirce use 'the proportion r' twice? Oughtn't the proportion of the Ss (possessing ∏) be symbolized by a different letter, as that proportion can differ from the proportion of Ms ? 

I am not sure what Camus intended to say by 'coupables': moral guilt only? Or criminal guilt? Camus looks to reject the notion of guilt, but how can he possibly be correct? Surely responsibility and guilt can be distinguished, e.g. in criminal law. The original French: 

I accept 3 as a correct definition of metaphysics, but not 1. The author isn't a philosopher, but has a BA, MA, and PhD in English; so I thought to check with you philosophers. 

Per my numbering, 1 differs from 2, because only 2 contains the AIF. So causation applies to different facts in 1 and 2. So I would conclude that causation succeeds in 1, but fails in 2. In contrast, the book appears to consider causation applied equally across 1 and 2.

Source: p 231 Bottom, Introducing Philosophy for Canadians: A Text with Integrated Readings (2011 1 ed). How did Hume remain 'jovial', 'merry' and 'unperturbed', despite the difficult perennial problems of philosophy? Would his brain not have hurt? I wish to learn from him to stay mentally healthful too. The following excerpt does not convince, because Hume's asserted abandonment of these philosophical problems is false (or else he would not written this book!), and Hume's reference to his pastimes does not explain his motivation to return to the problems (because even after his amusement, still true was the sentence that I coloured grey below.) 

To supplement the other answers here, I thought to quote from PhilosophyForums.com, but I modify the writing and omit blockquotes for easier reading. Source: Posted Oct 31, 2009 by user 'Hamandcheese' As a materialist I think every thing is made of matter, akin to naturalism. If someone claims, say, that a statue of Mary cried a tear, the materialist would point out: the substance that the rock is made out of, is all it is, and is no different than the rock before it was extracted from the earth, only that it has been shaped. Thus materialism is an important premise for my deductive and inductive reasoning. Empiricism is the statement that everything that we know, we know through our direct senses, or some other aided observation (an empiricist would be fine with a microscope). Traditionally empiricists reject the idea of innate ideas, being entirely skeptical that intuitions and instinct could reliably inform our knowledge. So the difference is pretty substantial. There are plenty of materialists who are not strict empiricists: that is, they think that only matter exists, but that some truth is innate in our brain and certain facts can be determined through intuitive reasoning. Empiricists, on the other hand, don't necessarily have to believe that all that exists is matter. Indeed, George Berkeley is famous for being both a strong empiricist and 'immaterialist'. Source: Posted Nov 1, 2009 by user 'mrnormal5150' empiricism tends to be an epistemological position while materialism is a metaphysical one. Sometimes one entails the other, but not always. 

I recognise that God probably cares more about serious matters than 'minute regulations' (eg: complex tax codes, which (one would prefer to think) God would simplify), but the use of the adverb simply feels too unconditional and biased to me; I do not understand why it is simply implausible that determinism determines law. Am I correct that the above quotation presupposes 100% free will, and rejects entirely determinism? Or did I neglect something that makes the above evident even for Free Willers (ie: Libertarians)? 

To aid remembrance, I change the names of the people to R for Recluse and S for Stalker. Because the original refers to 1 as the premise and 2 as the conclusion, I'll just write 1 and 2. 

How is the above an AtP? Socrate's use is too subtle for me to discern. It appears a Valid Syllogism to me, if I summarise the argument: Premise 1. If someone produces emotive ostentations before judges, then these ostentiations are AtPs. Premise 2. If something is an AtP, I do not do it. Conclusion: 3. I do not do emotive ostentations before judges. 

The quote never defines 'merit goods', so how is (b) correct by inference? Does the explanation overreach? Or do I misinterpret 'inference'? Doesn't the explanation in (d) overreach? Anyhow, I thought that (d) could be successfully inferred. According to the quote, without the government, the bolded happens, and thus is inefficient, because there are no goods! However, once the government enters, then these goods are provided. Isn't this a logical inference? 

How is 1 always true? What if an announcement, complaint, compliment, or expression of sorriness asserts (i.e. propounds supporting reasons) to establish itself true?

How does the above exemplify the Genetic Fallacy? I accept that the senator didn't directly refute the allegations of , but is the senator's remark (at least) somewhat genuine? After all, the news accused the senator; so it's logical to question the news's reliability? 

Am I right that this small attention means the problem of leaping from [is and is not] to [ought and ought not]? Even if so, how does this subvert all the vulgar systems of morality?
