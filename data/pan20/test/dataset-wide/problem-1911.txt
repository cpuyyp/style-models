Given a company with offices in Colorado and Silicon Valley, it's likely that they have different teams. In which case asking for a transfer is indeed unreasonable - the manager in CO is taking a chance on you, the manager in CA is unlikely to want to take the same chance based solely on a co-workers opinion. In time a transfer might be reasonable, but at the moment the best you could reasonably hope for is an interview and no negative comments from the CO manager. More likely, you would get told no, and if you applied outside of the interal channels, that would be taken as a negative. If you had applied for the CA job before getting an offer, things would be different, but now it would probably be taken as either indecision or unreliability. Neither desirable traits. If they are the same team, asking for CA would be perfectly acceptable. Whether the salary scales would depend entirely on the company, chances are they have different scales for the different offices. As for salary negotiations, you can try to use whatever you want to, how much they will go will depend upon how much they think you are worth, and company policy. 

I think a remote worker is inherently more creditable when reporting sick leave. After all, if they just wanted to goof off for a day, they have a better chance of getting away with it while getting paid than your onsite worker. You have to trust them more, why would you suddenly trust them less just because they say they are sick? So, I would say there is less stigma for remote workers. 

I wouldn't say approaching someone in a lobby could never get you a job in the software industry, but it is unlikely to be an efficient or reliable way of doing so. First you have to realize that a great deal of work in the "software industry" is not actually in companies that produce software -- instead the organization need internal applications that are specific to their needs. Which means that the majority of people in the organization may not even know they have anything more than a help desk. Even in companies that are focused on software development, many employees will not be working on a development team -- they will be sales or office staff, accounting and so forth. So, no matter how you look at it, your random person in the lobby is probably not in a position to help you... While the best way to get a job is to have someone on the inside that wants you for the position, for software that means someone either on the team, involved with the hiring process or a project sponsor. Even if you luck out and get someone related to the position, you still haven't achieved much...HR and the sponsor may not know the details, they do know that it is a technical position and are unlikely to put themselves out to recommend you for a position they do not understand. For members of the team, the situation is actually worse -- they do understand the demands of the position, and know that you can't really proce your skills in just a few minutes of casual talk. In short, while anyone is probably willing to point you towards an opening if one is available, they aren't going to be willing to go so far as to recommend you. It's not impossible, you might impress a sponsor with your enthusiasm, a few minutes of conversation might convince someone on the team that you both know enough and will fit in well with the team. But it's a long shot. You would almost certainly better spend your time and energy filling out online applications, or seeing if there isn't something you can do on a volunteer basis (church or charity). 

The answer to this qurstion is always going to be at LEAST company/contract specific (i.e. different for the mailboy than the CEO). That said, in general the problem with your scenario is that your last day of work is prior to your last day of employment. If you aren't working you aren't taking time off before returning to work. There are other factors in your being an employee than your raw salary -- insurance to name just one. It is generally not going to be in the organizations interest to have you on the books as an employee past the time when you are working. In short, while possible, it is unlikely. Note that extending your notice period with PTO may be acceptable -- by this I mean you give 5 weeks of notice and take 3 weeks of PTO in the middle. You working a week or a half week after your PTO may be beneficial to them. You'd have to get approval from your other job for that, which may be a harder sell. Bottom line (and why this question may get closed): it depnds. 

I would not be afraid to let coworkers, managers, or prospective employers know that I have asked questions on SO. Asking questions means that you had a problem and thought asking a question would help you solve it (occassionaly it means you solved a problem and thought it worthwhile to share the solution). It's not a sign of incompetence. I would be wary of the quality of the question and the experience level implied by the question. If you are concerned, I would suggest that you review your questions, and see what you think of them now and whether they can be improved. Questions, like answers can be editted. 

Both professional and professional ethics are in the context of work, and absent specific terms in your contract, this is fundamentally a personal decision. Both you and your employer can reasonably expect your employment to continue only so long as it is both mutually beneficial and satisfactory -- whether that is 5 seconds or 5 decades depends entirely on circumstances. Now, if you had taken the job after accepting a position with another company that started 2 weeks later and you never planned to continue with the job that started earlier, and did not inform them of that fact, that would have been both unprofessional and unethical. But that is not the described scenario, in this case you are simply evaluating which position is better for you personally, and then acting on that. Consider a similar scenario, where instead of you receiving an offer, it is instead your spouse, recieveing a signicantly career enhancing position that was hoped for but not expected. Attempting to stick with your undesired job while rejecting a dream job for your spouse is not going to make your personal life better. And that is why you are working -- to make your personal life better than it would be otherwise. 

I'm not voting to close, but any answer to your question with actual numbers attached will be specific to the company in question. A more general answer is that is that these questions would only be answerable if the company was tracking the information, and for at least one of them, they can't and generally don't try. For the rest, while they might HAVE the information, it may not be in an easily queryable format. Finally, this is not the kind information that companies typically desire to be publicly available. Some will actively desire to supress the answers, others simple won't care to put any effort into it. In short, you can take Joe's advice, and ask, but expect the answer to be "we don't provide that information". 

Perhaps he should start by resigning from the company, as he is a liar.... Seriously, given the situation, saying you wiped your feet on a non-existent mat, is the equivalent to saying that his kid looks smart -- a social lie, meaning very little. Your co-worker's lie on the other hand is hypocritical AND done with malicious intent. So, is it professional to lie? Not unless you're a spy. It can be excused under some circumstances, but you should try to avoid even polite, social lies, during an interview. 

You should call an attorney, get an hourly rate, and if it seems reasonable, set up a meeting and discuss what you fear from the employee and what you hope to gain by writing this "letter". And as was pointed out by @JoeStrazzere do this before sending any letter. Worst case scenario would seem to be unethical attoreny charging you several hours of billable time for make work -- which would only seem likely if there wasn't in fact something they could have done that would have been more useful to you. Which means you get relatively cheap reassurance... Talk to a lawyer 

I don't really like to say quit or look for another job -- but if you aren't being paid what was agreed to, that is the only thing to do. The only question I would have in your situation, is do I need the $9 an hour while I look for another job? Personally I would rather work for someone that paid less and was honest, if you feel the same, keep that in mind when you decide what to do. 

Unless the "something" is specifically what the company is looking for, the HOW is more important than the what. So, your code should be be large enough to show that it is well written -- frequently it is a non-functional sample, so it doesn't necessarily even have to do what it is nominally supposed to do. It should be clear as to what it is supposed to do and that you follow best practices. By which I do not mean where you put the braces, except you should be consistent. I mean things like good variable and function names, error handling (whether that is exceptions or return codes), appopriate comments (not too many, not too few, focusing on why not what). Think of the code sample as the reverse of a code review -- instead of an opportunity to catch errors and learn how to do things better, it is a chance to show that you can do things correctly and without errors. The GNU Hello project or Enterprise FizzBuzz would definitely be pushing the size boundaries for a code sample, but conceptually they are the kinds of thing you want as a code sample.
