Athletes of all stripes consume protein shakes (and bars, etc.) as an adjunct to their normal diet. For some people it's difficult to eat all the food required to offset caloric deficiency. The thing is that in the US (and most western countries) protein deficiency is relatively rare. If there's something preventing the body from properly using dietary protein the usual approach would be to correct the problem rather than simply dumping more protein in. If someone is protein deficient they need more protein. It's often a caloric deficiency (fix: eating food) or a medical condition (fix: cure the issue). I'd assume the reason there isn't much literature specifically regarding using protein shakes to correct protein deficiencies is because there isn't much reason to do it. It won't be more or less effective than other protein sources (assuming a balance of different proteins); proteins are proteins regardless of their source. (I'd be somewhat concerned if there wasn't a wide range of proteins, e.g., if you only used a supplement with a single amino acid for example, but that's easier said than done.) 

Most "athletic hair removal" is done to make massages easier, so bandaids come off easier and gashes are easier to clean, sunscreen is easier to apply and more reliably applied, to reduce irritation and pulling in contact sports, and for psychological reasons. I suspect the reason it's difficult to find a study on body hair v. strength is because it's ridiculous on the face of it, and there's just no reason to do such a study. That said, in swimming an advantage is conferred: $URL$ I'm not aware of any studies showing an advantage for cyclists, another prime suspect. Running studies are mixed but have tended towards very slight advantages to being hairless, on the order of seconds over a marathon: $URL$ 

A good juicer gets a fair amount of skin, though how much nutrition is lost would depend a lot on the juicer. But it's not just about nutrients, it's about fiber. Fiber serves many purposes, including slowing the absorption of those nutrients and sugars (less insulin spike), and fiber is something the body needs. I don't see anything wrong with juicing, and it's tasty. But IMO it shouldn't be the sole source of fruit and vegetable consumption, because you're missing a lot of what they have to offer, in terms of both nutrients and fiber. All this said, not really a fitness question. 

AFAIK high blood pressure isn't caused by pushups per se. Exercising can exacerbate high blood pressure, even while helping to lower it long-term. If you "feel movements in your head" or simple dizziness it's a sign you should stop immediately. Discuss your exercise plan(s) with your doctor and get professional medical advice, which this forum is not equipped to deliver. It may be nothing–it may not be. Short of being examined and tested, nobody online can tell you anything of value other than be very careful, get a checkup, maybe do an exercise stress test under the supervision of a doctor, etc. 

Strength exercises, tending towards lower reps and higher weight, is (more or less) the only thing that will increase muscle mass, or at least maintain it (within limits). I'd consider 40% bodyfat past the point of being healthy, IIRC in the US 25-30%+ is considered obese*. If it were me, I'd focus quite a bit more on reducing that, rather than trying (specifically) to increase muscle mass. On the plus side, bringing up muscle mass will increase resting metabolism, which will help bring the body fat levels down. For me, short circuits of body-mass exercises hit the sweet spots between muscle mass, metabolism, effectiveness, and likelihood I'll actually exercise. Consider the bodyweight and equipment circuits of pehlwani/kushti (पहलवानी/कुश्ती); I find them incredibly effective (if not a bit painful if I "misplace the mace"). *Noting that there's some debate about what a "healthy" body fat percentage is. 

I'm with Dave on "renegade rows", one of the best exercises ever. Honestly, when it comes to dumbbells, I'm more of a "oh, my muscles can make things move this way" kind of person. There aren't a lot of options, ultimately--curls, hammer curls, forearm curls, wrist rolls for the biceps and forearms. Skull crushers and kickbacks for the tris. Front, side, and rear lateral raises, presses at various angles for the shoulders. Shrugs. Rows. You can use DBs for things like deadlifts, wood choppers, olympic lifts, etc. as well. 

A shake is food; you're eating it. If you're trying to maintain a certain daily calorie level (e.g., maintain a specific deficit for weight loss, or surplus for gain) then both the shake and exercise must be counted. 

They're worth a teeny bit :) It's a very rough estimate, and depends on all sorts of things, even the weather. (Perhaps not the phase of the moon.) That said, the lower number is closer to what I'd expect. 

Sweatpants, running tights (loose or tight fit), etc. That said, a pair of military cargo pants/BDUs have always been baggy enough for me and haven't ever inhibited range of motion. Plus when ninjas come they can't see your legs. 

It's effective for what it does, but if you're looking for pure strength, it's not optimal. It's great at working core, stabilizers, and bodyweight exercises, and IMO they're worth having. If your goal is to increase raw strength, though, you'll need to lift heavy. When I was faced with very limited space the Bowflex Selecttechs worked great, then I augmented that with a small set of heavy-ish kettlebells and two good sandbags. Since you have to lug gear around, a weight vest might also be nice. All that said, I'm a pretty firm believer in bodyweight and functional exercises for jobs like that; while Navy SEALs lift heavy and hard, the core of their training is exactly like you see in the TV: pushups, situps and other core work, pullups, running, and carrying around heavy shit. It works. 

Weight lifting is work. Work requires calories. Think of it this way: just being alive burns calories. Being alive and lifting heavy things will burn more calories, because you're doing more work. Whether or not you should be eating more calories depends on what you're trying to do. If you're trying to maintain weight, and you've increased your caloric expenditure, you would need to increase your caloric intake to keep pace. If you're trying to lose or gain weight, you'd need to adjust your caloric intake to match your targeted loss/gain pace. 

Protein is calories; additional calories will help gain weight. It's important to get fast-acting proteins (whey) and high-glycemic-index carbs very soon after working out (15-30 minutes). Isolate is "better", but more expensive. Is it enough better that cost shouldn't be a factor? Probably not. I personally tends towards a mix--some fast-acting, very pure (isolates), BCAAs for specifics, concentrates, and slower-acting, to cover my post-workout bases and to make sure there's a steady stream of protein. Casein-only (or primarily, at least) is good for night-time since it's slow-acting. Can be a powder, or just cottage cheese (sort of our version of uncompressed paneer) because it's tasty, and I like to eat.
