Do you have documentation, or are you the docs? If the latter - too bad, they're going to refer to the docs as much as they can and you're going to have to answer. Of course, you could start writing down all you know and then referring them to that so in time you'll be less necessary. In the other case, refer them to the docs, and refer them to the areas of code they need to look in. If you add in some architectural knowledge that will help but then, once you've shown them where to look, leave them to it. Another thing that helps is code reviews. Tell them to come up with whatever solution they think is best but to bring it to you for checking before any coding starts. That helps them gain confidence in that they've worked it out correctly before making a mess. When they get better at knowing the system, move your code review focus to actual code after they solution is coded, and use the opportunity to explain any areas they got wrong or (more likely) could be done better or more in keeping with the codebase. In time they'll get more confident and autonomous. 

As a junior you have little chance of directly doing anything. Going to your manager and 'telling tales' will only look bad for you. So you have to be a bit sneaky: make a suggestion to your manager that it would look really professional if all the people in ouur consultancy who had professional qualifications had them listed on the company website, along with those nice little smiling head pictures consultancies love so much. Then prospective clients could see just how extra awesome you lot are. Obviously you'd want to list the licence or certification details for that added impact. Leave it at that, if management don't want this suggestion then fine, just ignore it, injustices happen all the time. 

Your first course of action is to talk to the recruiter - the last thing you want is to spend 3 months preparing and then find that they don't really want you (for whatever reason). The other factor is, if you say you need 3 months of prep for their technical interviews, they are not going to think of you as someone who currently has the technical skills required and are asking them for the delay in order to obtain them. 3 months delay for an interview for personal reasons is one thing, 3 months so you can be a better coder would be a red flag to me. If you told them you have deadlines, long hours and you don't want to leave your current employer at such a busy time makes you sound more dedicated. but then expect them to push to get you to interview sooner anyway - you're the kind of guy they want! It might even be worth going to the interview straight away, as a junior with little experience, it gives you more experience. It also allows you to get to know them a little so that even if you fail the technical interview, you can ask to be kept on file until you've gained more experience and skills. I know for a fact that there are so many different technical tools used that nobody can be expected to know everything a company uses - startups are different though, and they expect you to be perfect right from the start. Going to interview would let you find out exactly what they want. 

If the test of the fire alarm is short - in my experience that means a 5 second ringing and then back to normal. If so, when the alarm goes off, look up, tell the interviewer, wait for the noise to stop, then continue as before. If its something you have control over - ensure you are not disturbed during this time, ie. prioritise the interview over the other thing if possible, if not, reschedule the interview for when you know you will not be disturbed. If you have no control over something random, well, too bad - improvise as best you can. 

Its a great question to be asked.. .because it immediately tells you to stop talking about your tech skills and start talking up your interpersonal, experience and general "wisdom" skills. They're obviously going to take age into account, to your detriment, so this is an opportunity to fight back at it, to explain that they need some old guys on the team to help mitigate the excesses of the youngsters, bring some long-term stability, not job-hop, etc etc etc. I suppose if you're at interview, and they're discriminating based on age, then you've already lost - I'm sure you don't look as smooth and sprightly as a 20 year old, so they can tell your rough age already. If a telephone interview, then its a judgement call whether to appear younger than you are, you may get to a face-to-face interview only to find you've wasted your time if they're never going to hire older people. 

You answer your own question - why does the management delegate this issue to the team? Becuase: They "has need to fulfill a business analyst position in our company" and "only place the person can be taken is our development team, because we are the only people who know somehow also the business side of the system that is developed." That's why. Now, you could argue that they need ot recruit a new team member, but maybe there is no money available to hire a new staff member. That means, if none of the devs want this position, then one will have to made redundant to make space for a BA to be hired. I doubt you want that either. So perhaps the best option is to get someone working part-time in the BA role, or to get your line manager to take the role on while one of the devs takes on more line management responsibilities. Communicate these issues but understand the reasoning why this change has to occur. Complaining that you all want to be devs and life is unfair isn't going to help you. 

I was once hired by a company that told me a particular role was wonderful - I'd be doing C++ on Linux development work with 10-20% of my time spent team leading. When I got there, it turns out it was C# on Windows and after a few months they wanted me to do 80% team leading work. Some companies, or their management, are just pants. My experience with these kinds of companies - the ones where they promise lots but deliver little - are that they will never get better, you are just a resource to them and you will never be happy there unless you just suck it up and lower your expectations to correspond with what they will give you. I've always found that moving jobs even after a short time somewhere is perfectly fine though. Its job-hoppers that recruiters have a problem with, people who cannot hold down any job. Nobody can predict the future and so sometimes holding a job for less than a year is just one thing that happens. Nobody will hold that against you unless its repeated (and then you can pretty much expect to be passed over at the CV stage). Just be honest about the situation without being derogatory. 

Although its very difficult to answer based on the particular circumstances (eg 'same religious university' - what kind of religion and what's their expectations towards marriage etc) the basic answer to this is to avoid any accusation of preferential treatment. That means moving this person off your team so they are managed by someone else. Or at least, have someone else deal with their HR management responsibilities if you cannot remove them from your technical or line management role. Anything less will eventually give an excuse to gossip that Z got a raise/bonus/etc because of the relationship and not their work. No matter how well you try to be transparent, accusations of bias will crop up, usually from people who didn't get the same raise/bonus/etc. Otherwise, consider what's more important to you - relationship with this person or your day job. (hint: nobody on their deathbed ever said they wished they'd spent more time in the office) 

I'd say something along the lines of "why? Does it matter?" and leave the ball hanging in their court. I doubt anyone sensible will consider the response to this question as something they can reasonably answer positively. And once they admit it doesn't matter, you've already moved the conversation on, away from this non-constructive subject. 

The best way is to be honest, when he asks next time give him his answer and tell him that you're bored with questions about sandwiches (hint: its the sandwich questions at fault, not him) but then its on you to offer a different topic of conversation, and to engage with him in taking about it. Ask him about TV, movies, sports, what he likes, anything to change the subject and ensure he has something else to talk about. Usually such questions start because they want a conversation but can't begin it, so they make tentative and safe approaches expecting to move it along to something more substantial, but if you're not responding well and opening up to the initial request then the conversation will be dropped, making this type of interaction common. The onus is on you to talk back, spend 5 minutes directly with him (you do have your sandwich to give you an excuse to break off conversation) and you'll probably find the conversations flow more naturally once you get over this block that's built up. (or at least, that's my assumption based on your question). 

Many people work for "free" - but usually because there's some other form of compensation for your time. That may be the promise of future work, skills transfer, or just the marketing capabilities of being associated with someone/something, or sometimes just the altruistic warm feeling of having done something useful (eg charity work). The question isn't a case of how much value you will get from this relationship - as it sounds like its not so much work for enough value to you to do it. The problem seems whether you are being "used". Chances are, you are! Many high-profile artists don't think in terms of money, its all about their creative abilities and when things get in the way of that (eg not having enough money to pay you) they can get a bit defensive. They also tend not to have the best people skills and come across as very authoritarian and fractious. So you have to understand him, and what he's asking for. If its a small job, and you can do it, and want to do it, then go for it. You'll learn a lot about him and his work. You'll be able to add it to your portfolio. You might even find that he's not so bad as you think once you get to know him.. or you might find he is a tyrant after all. Either way, you get some value from it, even if no future work comes directly your way from this. I would try to get more information from him about the project. "Quick and vague" doesn't sound right, if he thought you were ready to work with him, you might find he opens up a lot more about it. It might be best to judge the work on this, and also best put a time limit on whatever involvement you have with him.
