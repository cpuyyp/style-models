I could not find evidence of the discovery of a metal-heavy exoworld. This doesn't mean there isn't one, ony that I couldn't find one. Please note that humanity is in its most infant stages of exoplanetary discovery. We get whomping excited whenever we discover one. We're beginning to have some success analyzing atmospheres and are looking for solutions to discover plant life (which, if you think about it, is far more important to humans than the discovery of metals). 

Question: Given 40 Km2 solar sails (and ignoring necessary support structure), is it possible for a ship with a mass of 5,000,000 Kg traveling at 0.05c at a distance of 40AU from the sun to deploy those sails and, using only the solar wind, decelerate to 250,000 Kph before crossing the "orbital sphere" of Mercury? 

Photosynthesis isn't enough In a comment, @AlexP correctly points out that plants convert one molecule of oxygen for each molecule of carbon dioxide. If enough photosynthesis took place to keep CO2 at 0%, it would add only 0.04% to oxygen's existing 21%: an increase of a meaningless 0.2%. Let's look at nitrogen Oxygen is 10,000 times more abundant in the earth than nitrogen, so why is there so much nitrogen in the atmosphere? [Dr. Ken Rubin($URL$ explains that Nitrogen is stable, meaning it doesn't react to much in the solid earth or in the atmosphere. Basically, there's not that much that will absorb it. Where almost everything will absorb oxygen. Take humans, for example. We need the oxygen we breathe. We don't need the nitrogen. Curiously, plants do need nitrogen, but they cannot absorb it directly. Nitrogen assimilation is the process of gaining needed nitrogen through nitrate (NO3, a common component of fertilizer) and ammonium (NH4, not surprisingly, another common component of fertilizer). There are other ways to get nitrogen out of the air, but most requre it to bond with the oxygen we want to leave behind. An example is limestone, which absorbs nitrogen dioxide. The answer to your question: ammonia An absolutely amazing article describes the ability to use a few chemicals, electricity, water, and air to create ammonia, which binds nitrogen to hydrogen. With a little handwavium (OK, scientifically it's a lot of handwavium, but still...) we ignore the handful of chemicals and suggest... lightning. A change in solar radiation or the presence of a particle storm and the Earth's troposphere becomes electrically charged to a high degree. This makes thunderstorms not just common, but prolific, even ubiquitous. Since 2/3 of the earth's surface is ocean (and, electrically, it's better grounded than ground itself), most if not nearly all the lightning occurs over the ocean. Producing ammonia, and increasing the percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere, which means each breath you take is more efficient. I'm going to ignore what the extra ammonia in seawater does to the sea. The reason for this is that what Earth has today is a natural balance and we're talking about changing that balance. Something in the ocean would need to absorb that ammonia to convert it to something less toxic for fish. I'm also going to ignore the ionizing effects of lightning, which creates O3 (ozone) and nitrogen dioxide as byproducts. Have you ever heard the urban legend about margarine being toxic because it's only one molecule away from plastic (which is true, by the way)? Well, oxygen must be toxic, too, because it's just one atom away from ozone, which is toxic. I'm going to ignore this, too. 

No other combination of people will conceive children. This basically addresses your second bullet point. Now let's try for bullet point #1. Let's assume your planet has a bacteria or parasite that can only be rendered inert by the presence of both blood types. (Remember, I'm not a geneticist, or affiliated with the medical world in any plausible way, so someone practiced in the medical arts might find this reasoning flawed.) Let's run with a bacteria that is capable of feeding off of either blood type. However, once it starts feeding on one, it changes such that that one type makes it intolerant of the second blood type. This would protect the embryo until a viable immuno system develops that can naturally handle the bacteria (which is why no one is affected by the pestiferous bacteria after birth). The bacteria survives because there are plenty of male.K-/female.K- and male.K+/female.K+ couplings to allow for its survival. The couplings may result in an infertile embryo, but an embryo is created nonetheless, one that the bacteria can feed on. I can't address bullet point #3 because I have nowhere near enough insight into physiology and evolutionary genetics to even think about what you might be missing. 

The cheap way out happens to be the way life does it How do humans go through life not poking themselves in the eye with a finger? How to Rhinos not gore every rhino they meet? How does a rolling horse not roll over its colt? How did my pet iguana not slap itself into a stupor when it let that very leathal tail off its leash? 

In this case, your biggest problem is how to get them out of the bus without seriously inconveniencing other passengers. There may need to be rungs up the side of the bus (perhaps on the bottom of the hide-a-seat) that would let the birds climb to the open roof to stretch their wings and leap. One last thing... while an imaginative engineer might figure out a way to let humans and really big birds cohabit the same coach space, in reality their needs are so very different that it's impractical to do it. In the end, you'd probably have busses and train cars dedicated to each species. After all, you'd be just barely inclined to forgive the fat, smelly dude taking the last open seat next to you, but the first time feathers brushed your hair or a wing smacked you on the head as the avioid soared into the air... you'd be complaining to your city council. 

The basis of this idea (e.g., chemically reducing intellect) has already been explored in an episode of "House M.D." (Ignorance is Bliss) The episode describes how it was medically accomplished. Methinks that's exactly what you're looking for. From the synopsis on Wikipedia... 

1 Which really makes me wonder what those astronomers who think they've found evidence of mega-structures actually found. They really don't make any sense. But, people bought into the idea that NASA found a face on Mars. Until someone got a better look at it. 

EDIT: Yes, the commenters are completely correct, there are rivers separating Canada from Michigan. My sincere apologies, but I consider those land connections because all they need is a bridge. Lakes, on the other hand, are more difficult. 

EDIT: I was looking at the link @Era provided in the comments below and it produced yet another idea (way to go @Era!). Let's a assume a massive volcanic caldera with strong basalt deposits in the outer ring but porous pumice or lava rock in the center ... something that can be eroded over the millenia. This would probably be unbelievable for 2,500Km, but could be believed for 500Km (bigger would require a tectonic ring of fire that subsided, allowing the surrounding ocean to flood in). What you would get is a very large version of this... (Yes, it's a sinkhole, but that's basically what an eroded center is.) 

Let's relate magic to electricity. I'm an electrical engineer, and the mastery of electricity is no small thing. Most of my peers would agree that it's our privilege to stand on the shoulders of a great many scientists and engineers who have worked like dogs to understand this particular juju and how to manipulate it. Electricity is omnipresent. It's everywhere. It manifests itself in small ways when we shuffle across a floor and touch our best friend's arm. It manifests itself in large ways when a bolt blows apart a tree. Aspects of electricity can be quickly mastered by children. Other aspects are difficult to master after years of study. Electronic circuits are akin to runes. A path must be drawn through which electricity must flow. Draw the path improperly, or use the "elements" of the spell (components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, and transistors) improperly and the spell won't work. Use them badly enough and a world of pain will be your companion (don't believe me? Stick a 10uF cap into any electrical socket and watch what happens... BOOM!) Electricity has specialties. Electromagnetic majors study wave propagation and transmission (think "antenna"). Semiconductor majors study the flow of electricity through various materials (think "music" and, more distantly, "computers"). Powerflow majors study the transmission of massive amounts of electricity (think "power lines"). Magnatism studies lead to motors & generators, etc. From that perspective, there's a lot that hinder people from "just using magic." As a "power source," there are many schools of study: starting from "basic magic for high school students" to "advanced channeling of energy for distribution within city limits." The real question is how practical are you trying to make this? What makes you good at electricity magic? Memory, concentration, dedication, and education. Oh, one last thing. Why don't we teach 7-year-olds about basic electricity? Because they're still of a mind to stick screwdrivers into outlets. Showing them how to do it isn't necessarily a good thing. 

Let's break this down to something simpler. Why would you want an android to proactively save itself from harm? An ultra-simplistic view of self-awareness is our ability to choose never to touch a hot stove a second time. We do this to avoid being hurt: but it's much more than a reaction to pain. Simple self-awareness is the ability to plan our future to avoid that pain. So, why would we want to program a (e.g.) multi-million dollar android to avoid threatening circumstances? (Yup, rhetorical question.) And if the programming is good enough, could the android "justify" a decision to avoid doing something because "similar things" in its past suggest it "might" be injured? After that it's one small step to, "why should I work in the dangerous mines for these darn humans?" Whole revolutions have been born on that one, simple idea. 

Raw Materials—Iron/Steel, rubber, brass/copper, diesel/gasoline (we're mechanized, right?).... This is almost the deal killer. The problem with raw materials is that they're almost never where you need them. One might be here, but another is way up north, and another is on the other side of a difficult to defend bridge, and yet another is hundreds of miles away. Each facility requires electricity and communication, defense, plus all the tools they need to dig, extract, purify, and transport their production. Oh, did I say transport? Dang... this is getting messy... Transportation trucks, big trucks, little trucks, and the cars that help people get to where the trucks are.... And that means fuel, and lubricants, and tires (lots and lots of tires), and more metal, and the ability to construct and maintain them. Which means we need wrenches.... Dependency Manufacturing This is the real killer, and I apologize for the lengthy path to get to this point — but it's a path that had to be experienced. To run a factory (and all of its dependencies, which I've only touched on... and that should terrify you, by the way...), you need tools. Those tools come from somewhat simpler factories, which need tools, which come from (occasionally) somewhat simpler factories, which need tools. This is THE vicious circle when it comes to bringing any form of modern technology back to life. You need nuts & bolts, screwdrivers and wrenches, welding and die cutting, rolling and molding, and a whole lot more. I wouldn't be at all surprised to discover that the manufacture of a tank — even a simple tank like a Sherman — requires 30+ factores OTHER than the tank factory making all those other tools and parts. Remember, you also need trucks and conveyor belts, and mining drills, and gunpowder... somewhere somebody had better be making the gunpowder... Ugh. And, of course, each of those factories requires access to raw materials, electricity, communication, transportation... Now you have a city, and need much more than just what your tank needs You need food distribution, waste disposal, utiltities, a judiciary, and recreation (if you don't want a riot on your hands), and (of course) government, police, fire, medical, and janitors... everybody always forgets the janitors.... Modern technology of any kind sits atop a pyramid of technological advancement and both social and manufacturing infrastracture. That pyramid is astonishingly massive in a way that makes the Apollo moon missions seem like a quick pop to the corner store for a burrito. Yes, you can do without some of that pyramid... but not all of it... or even most of it. If it were possible to "just build a tank" then people would be doing it in their garages for fun. Which brings us back to stability A political collapse means looting and vandalism, but most of the infrastructure is still more-or-less intact. You need the specialized labor, but that can be retrained with time. All you need is stability and you can get people back to work. The question is, can you restabilize a city, plus the farming and mining areas it depends on, before the skills are injuriously lost or the machines, etc., begin to decay (rust stinks...)? If the answer is yes, then the most viable path is the path to stability, which might require an army, which requires logistics and support, which requires manufacturing... Oh, dear...
