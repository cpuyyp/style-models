Krakow is amazingly beautiful and interesting town, so you may end up spending all your time in the town itself, but there are some great opportunities for hiking nearby. There are several websites about Krakow that you can look at. This one lists some ideas for day trips. The Ojcow national park is just north of Krakow, apparently it is possible to get there by bus. If you are willing to travel a bit further, about 70km south of Krakow are the Beskidy mountains, with Gorczanski and Babigorski national parks. All of those are definitely worth seeing, and offer plenty of hiking opportunities. It takes about hour and 30 minutes to get from Krakow Main station to Sucha Beskidzka, which is sort of a gateway into that part of Beskidy mountains. There is a very nice brochure(pdf) describing some hiking opportunities in the region. 

I spent some time in a wigwam today, and due to the wind conditions, it was very difficult to keep the smoke out. Are there some tricks one can use in a situation like that to make the wigwam more habitable, or to deal with the smoke in some way? 

50N refers to 50 newtons. This is the buoyancy force that the buoyancy aid provides (10N ~= 1kg). This site has some useful information on buoyancy aids and ratings. 50N is the pretty much the standard rating for things like kayaking or dinghy sailing, with the occasional higher rating (60/70N). However, note that they are not designed to self right and so won't stop you drowning if unconscious. Therefore they are advised for use only when help is readily available. 100N buoyancy aids basically foam life-jackets and are primarily designed for weak/non-swimmers and to protect against drowning if unconscious. However, there is still a risk of drowning as not may not self right and does not protect well against heavy seas. 150N is generally inflatable life-jackets. These provide better protection against drowning but are obviously not suitable for kayaking, dinghy sailing or anything where you are likely to go in the water. 

Disclaimer: I rarely use GPS system personally so feel free to correct me if I've misunderstood something. However, I think that 2000 points should be more than enough. Say you are doing a reasonably long route of 40km per day. If you use all 2000 points in that distance that will give you one point every 20m. Give that the accuracy of your GPS under some conditions is probably about the same as this, more points won't really help. For comparison when using a paper map I guess I will look at the map maybe 100 times in such a walk although it is dependent on terrain and (mentally or physically) I will actually mark 10-20 points per day. From a safety point of view the GPS should provide your position irrespective of the route you have set. So this should not be a factor. Reading your question again I think you might actually be talking about saving the route you've been. In any case my point on the distance per point still stands. A quick look at the model in question shows that 2000 is the number of locations you can save. It can save 200 routes each of (up to)? 10000 points. So you should have no problems in that regard. 

I have used hexamine fuel in sub-freezing temperatures before, and my experience is that it works reasonably well if you keep your stove protected from the wind. In cold weather it will take several cubes to get your water boiling. You really need to keep the stove protected from wind, though, even in warm weather, the flame gets blown off pretty easily. 

The country is crisscrossed by an extensive system of inteconnected hiking trails, that allows you to get on foot from pretty much any place to any other place. The system is maintained by the Klub Českých Turistů (Czech Tourist Club), and consists of two components: trail markings and corresponding maps. Each trail is assigned one of four colors: red, yellow, green or blue. It used to be that red color was reserved for long distance trails, often following a long mountain range or a similar such feature, yellow trails were shorter, branching from the red ones, and green and blue were reserved for local or connecting trails, but as far as I can tell, that is no longer strictly followed. The trails are marked in terain by trail marks that look like a horizontal color stripe (red, yellow, green or blue) between two horizontal white stripes, like this: 

You can get a weather forecast for Zion here. As you can see, daytime temps are about freezing or slightly above by night temps can drop pretty low. In my opinion camping in -10 to -15 C is pretty cold and you need to have the right gear, although its definitely possible. Obviously make sure you have suitably warm clothes, a decent tent and you'll probably want a good 4 season sleeping bag. If you have not camped in these kinds of conditions before I'd recommend planning so you can easily escape to somewhere warm e.g. your car if you need to. 

Presuming you're planning on eating at/near your vehicle you're not really limited by the weight or bulk of the food. So, anything you can easily cook in 1 or 2 pots is a good bet. Generally, I have some version of pasta/rice/couscous and sauce. You can make your own sauce if you can get fresh ingredients or get reasonably cheap jars or dried packets. I like adding some chorizo or similar spiced sausage to my sauces, particularly various red sauces. It keeps well and you can add it separately if people are vegetarian. Most places in Europe, definitely Germany and Italy, have there own varieties. They are also quite good for snacking, although some varieties may need cooking. For breakfast, fried breakfasts are always good. Otherwise, if you can get fresh milk cereal is an option or bring powdered milk. I also like porridge, although it is a pain to clean. For porridge, I'd recommend a mix of half porridge oats and half ready brek/instant porridge, with powder milk that can be prepared in advance. 

It depends a lot on what exactly you mean by "around there". While there are no real mountains in the immediate area around Prague, you can find a number of great places to hike there. If you a willing to go a bit further, you can find some nice mountains, too. Also, I am not sure if by two day hike you mean a backpacking trip with sleeping outdoors, or if you plan to find some other means of accomodation. I can give you some information that is based on my own experience from over 20 years ago, together with chats with friends and information availabe on the web. First, two useful pieces of information everyone looking for hiking or backpacking opportunities in Czech Republic: 

Now, back to hiking opportunities near Prague. There are actually several shorter but nice hikes. One of them is the "Prokopské valley". You can either take a bus to the Zlíchov station and take the blue trail up to the valley, or, from Jinonice subway station, yellow and green trails both go down. The valley has a number of interesting geological features. Other interesting areas are "Modřanská rokle" on the other side of the river, area around Roztoky and Suchdol in the north, the Botič valley in the east, and several other smaller areas. These are all shorter hikes, partly through urban or suburban environment, but can be quite nice. For longer hikes, and more natural ones, I recommend the region in the south of Prague. It is more hilly, with some prety good hiking. Probably the most mountain like part of this region is the area called Brdy. It is a range of wooded hills that stretch from the southern edge of Prague for some 50 or 60 km south west past Příbram. Unfortunately the central part of this range belongs to the military and is mostly closed to the public, but the northern part has some very nice hiking. There are several ways how to get there from Prague: 

Personally, I think that most decent backpacking tents will be fine for Iceland. The temperature is not extremely cold and you should be fine as long as you have a semi-decent sleeping bag. One thing I would recommend is getting a tent that can be self supporting (i.e. doesn't need pegging out to stand up) this can be very useful if you have to camp on rocky ground, they also tend to be a bit more secure in the wind. I'm not too experienced with sand storms, but as njzk2 says try and get a tent with a non-mesh inner as this will give you an extra layer of protection. Also have a look at your route to for the risk of sandstorms. A quick search indicates that sandstorms are mainly an issue in spring/autumn and primarily in certain areas to the south of the island so they may be not too much of a concern. For tents it is generally a balance between weight and sturdiness/protection/warmth. You can get some very light tents but they won't offer you the same protection as a slightly heavier one (at least not without being very expensive). Personally the tent is not the first place I look to make weight savings. Finally, I wouldn't worry about fibreglass poles. I don't think I've broken any that weren't over 5 years old. Even if you do they generally just snap or splinter more than shatter, and can generally be fixed with some Duct tape and maybe a stick (Duct tape is always essential kit). 

There is another problem with making a fire in a natural cave: the smoke propagating through the cave can severely affect various cave-dwelling species, particularly bats. That is especially bad during winter, when smoke and warm air from the fire can wake up the bats and drive them out of the cave, causing them to freeze or starve to death. 

You will then follow the red trail through Karlík valley and Mořinka all the way to Karlštejn. The castle in Karlštejn is a very popular tourist attraction, and can be pretty crowded. Most visitors take a train or bus to the village, and climb the souvenir shop encrusted road up to the castle. The red trail will bring you to the castle from different side. You will still have to pass through some of the madness, but you will avoid the worst. You can visit the castle if you want. Then continue on the red trail past the castle. Keep following the red trail till you get to an intersection of several trails called "Propadlé Vody". From there you have number of options, but my favorite always was to take the yellow trail to the north, marked on the map as "Svatojánský okruh" (St. John circle). It will take you past the Arnika cave, through some interesting long abandoned limestone quarries all the way to a vist point on the top of the cliff overlooking the St. John valley and the monastery. Bacrtacking a bit and following the trail further will take you down to the valley. From there, you have several options. You can take the blue trail north and catch a train or bus in Vráž. You can stay on the red trail and end up in the city of Beroun, with several options for transportation back tp Prague. Or you can take the yellow trail south to Srbsko, where you can take a train back to Prague. If you want to hike more, you have a number of options, including those: 

In general 'lighter' fuels with less additives will mean that the stove needs less cleaning. Most of the reason I've needed to clean a stove is from additives which don't burn properly (particularly when igniting the stove) can can block the nozzle and things. For this reason compressed gas is probably best, followed by white gas, petrol (gasoline) and paraffin (kerosine) bring up the rear. I haven't really used paraffin enough to know which is better. Having said this the biggest risk is that most multifuel stoves (at least the MSR whisperlite) have different nozzles for different fuels. Using the wrong nozzle is the easiest way to block it, particularly using the white gas/petrol nozzle for paraffin. The other big source of soot is lighting the stove. If the stove needs preheating to burn this involves burning fuel under atmospheric conditions. The fuel burns inefficiently and will produce lots of soot. Once it is burning well little soot should be produced. I'm not sure if fuel type has a significant effect on o-rings etc. I wouldn't think it is significant. The only advice I've been given on that is to not store your fuel bottles pressurized. There are probably several reasons why this is a bad idea but forcing fuel into the seals for a long period isn't likely to do then good. Conclusion: If you use it well any fuel shouldn't require much more maintenance, but gas and white gas are probably easiest. 

To get some idea what you can see in Brdy, you can look at this site. Another great area for hiking, less hilly but perhaps more interesting, is just on the other side of the Berounka river. The "Český Kras" (Bohemian Karst) is somewhat more popular and can be, at least in some areas, quite crowded, but if you avaid the most obvious tourist attractions, you can find some excellent hinkng. Again, there is a number of ways how to get there: 

They are usually found on trees, rocks or buildings, and can look like this. At places where the trail changes direction, it is often marked using an arrow version of the mark: 

Imagine the following situation: A group of friends found a remote spot in a state or national forest that they really like. They keep returning to the place quite often, lately there are at least some members of the group staying overnight at the spot at least once or twice a month. They established a fire ring, surrounded by rocks, and someone dragged few logs around the fire to sit on. They have a rope strung in the trees to hand their food from. Now some of them have an idea that it would be nice to build few camp benches instead of the logs, and perhaps some primitive wooden shelter. It is clear that there is some sort of limit, they clearly cannot go and build a large log cabin there. There must be some sort of limit between few logs around a circle of rocks for fireplace and a cabin. I am wondering what would still be considered OK, and where one would cross the limit. 

As you say it is rather flat around there. So you will be quite hard pressed to find any significant hills that close to you. The most obvious area that comes to mind is the Chilterns. Although, that is still a good 2 hour drive so probably too far. Various websites provide possible hikes for a given location. If you look through some of these you may find something of interest. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ (This one looks quite good but you have to sign up to actually view the routes). I used to use another one for hikes around London/south coast a couple of years ago, which was good, but I can't remember what it was called/find it again. If you go some where with cliffs coastal walks can also be relatively hilly. If there is anyone more local to you on here they may be able to give more specific advice. 

A few others I could think of: Foxes Foxes are generally not aggressive are easily scared away by humans. However, there have been cases of fox attacks of on small children. It should be noted these incidents are very rare. Interestingly this appears to be more of an urban problem possibly caused by the close proximity between humans and foxes and the apparent trend of people feeding foxes in their gardens. Dogs Dog attacks are probably one of the larger 'wildlife' risks in the UK. According to this article there have been 5 deaths from dog bites since 2005, estimated >200,000 incidents per year resulting in approximately 6,000 hospital admissions. Recent legislation has increased the maximum sentence for dog attacks which cause injury from two to five years. Anecdotally I'll also add that dogs often try and run in front of my bike while cycling which could be another hazard. Birds of Prey There are many species of birds of prey in the UK some of which have been relatively recently re-introduced after becoming extinct due to hunting. Some are quite large (Sea eagles are the largest with a 2.5m wingspan. There are various reports of birds of prey attacking lambs. This has caused some unpopularity with farmers with reports of some birds being illegally poisoned on killed. There have also been fears that eagles may attack small children although there have been no reported cases and the RSPB calls these claims 'alarmist'.
