Unlikely. Galaxies have a massive, rotating core, which gives the whole thing a preferred axis. On a smaller scale, globular clusters $URL$ are indeed spherical, but they're not galaxies. 

Unrealistic. In the age of industrialisation, nobody in his right mind would just have given up on the coal mines at Ruhr and Saar. 

If you can make your power plant to run maintenance-free, it will work forever, that is until geological changes destroy it or remove the heat source. Could happen in 1000 or in a million years. If you want to play it safe, take a place without some special heat source, some location which has been geologically stable for millions of years. In 1 meter depth, the earth has the local yearly average temperature, and from there on, the thermometer rises 1°C every 30 meters (approximately, until you reach the mantle in ~400 km depth). 

An extended, regular 2D structure is necessarily unstable (Landau-Peierls instability and friends) and will always make an irregular wave pattern, and then if there is no external 3D frame structure that forces it, crumble into a ball. So, question two : Not possible. At temperatures ever closer to absolute zero, the allowed size of the blade will rise, but that is rather impractical. ;-) Question one: It will definitely be quite translucent, and have a different colour than the bulk material, because the 2D structure has a quite different electronic structure. 

Three or four satellites around each planet, high enough so they see each other and one is always visible from any place (except polar latitudes) on the ground. For a reliable system, eight satellites might be a safer bet. You'd want to be able to connect to two of them to minimise loss during switchover. Plus two (one is essentially redundant) additional communications platforms in earths Lagrange points 4 and 5. That way you always have at least two clear views at every spot in the solar system. You'll want to add these lagrangian platforms to all planets so you can always connect directly between any of them. Saves bandwidth and delays. 

I'm taking your idea of an interplanetary substance that can transport sound for granted, here. ;-) You won't hear a lot, a guess. A loudspeaker with the angular diameter of the sun (0.5°) (as "seen" from your ear) cannot be very loud, if it doesn't have a horn or something, but emits in all directions. 

It seems that doesn't matter. Earth gravity varies a bit with geographical location, but you don't have to re-calibrate high-resolution laboratory scales every half hour because the relative position of your lab to the moon has changed. I'll have to think a bit why this is so, because we do have tides, which certainly have something to do with the moons gravity. 

Virus, no. A virus is replicated by human cells, and can only be compatible if evolved on earth or artificially made by someone who knows exactly how earth biology works. Some other pathogens,possible, if not very likely. They'd have to be able to live on something that exists in humans. I guess glucose might be it. Still it would only be a 1 in 8 chance encounter if the alien pathogen thrives on the same stereoisomer of a hexose. 

The inelastic part in any collision (call it friction, if you like) will decelerate any moving object in a very short time (hours or days, maximum). Below a certain collision speed, objects will stick to the walls due to van der Waals forces. 

A large settlement could quickly start feeling mature and stop growing. Or rather it would automatically grow slower, because it has relatively little unsettled area immediately next to it to grow into. 

(I'm expecting you want a wealthy community here, not barely staying alive. For the latter just have a look at the history of Siberia.) The question is quite broad, but a few ideas: Building below the ground is surely a good idea, if your people have invented chimneys and a somewhat clever ventilation system so the place stays dry and healthy. A largish village or town is certainly advisable, because without specialised professions, you spend a lot of time doing elementary things in an inefficient manner. Also helps with trading, which is good for the same reasons. Farming, certainly. You probably need a well supported network of smaller villages around your larger settlement to have a large enough area. Nomad herding (or hunting) is only viable if you can trade the prouducts very well. Wheat doesn't grow well in northern Europe, but the "Siberean" region you think about is probably more southern, and dryer. Anyway rye is the more robust alternative, and tastes better anyway. 

Doesn't have to be water? Great! Water is stupid anyway, boils off, totally. For a short time you get residual ice and snow, and earth has a ring system, but you don't want to sell space postcards, do you? So, to business: What you need is a liquid without vapour pressure. Ionic liquids. They're cheap, you can get them at a few hundred euros per liter nowadays. And I'll give you a real good discount for any order of more than 200 cubic kilometres. Getting the feedstock for my lunar factories might be a bit tricky in the beginning. But I'm sure we can work something out with my friends who collect spent comets and stray asteroids to get all the necessary carbon and fluorine. I really hope your bank will be up to it. Delivery is immediately stopped when monthly advance payments are interrupted. As a plus, I guarantee without additional cost a minimal amount of foaming for at least six months. Can be extended to 12 month for a modest 25% surcharge, in advance. 

If the earth-like moon is large enough to hold an atmosphere (and is warm enough in average), it will likely be totally fine for life. It will have kicked out or swallowed all moons (hence it got so big) in close vincinity in the first few million years of its existence, so the orbit is stable. If it's too close to the planet, it gets sterilised every day, OK. No life. If it is close, but outside of the radiation belt, it will be tidally locked, have a rotation period in the range of a day, fine. There is a daily solar eclipse that lasts for a few hours or so, but the IR radiation from the planet smooths that out. The outer half of the moon never sees the planet anyway. The magnetic field of the planet shields the atmosphere perfectly. If it is further out, but still tidally locked, the day-night cyle is longer, that might be bad for life developing. If it is even further out it can be not tidally locked, super. The moon should perhaps have his own magnetic field, which is no problem if it's earth sized. If it has a rotation period less than 48 hours or so, it's fine for life. 

Evolution favoured nine month because a newborn that was significantly larger and further developed would be stuck inside, because it's mother belongs to a species that has evolved into walking upright etc. No problem for you. But: Human newborns are not exactly underdeveloped. It's true for the bone structure, they are very small, for the reason given above. Otherwise they are rather overdeveloped for their age. Respiratory, immune, digestive system, all working (more or less). It would surely be possible to adapt a lot of this, because it all happens in close interaction with the mother's body. Question is how, and how high the price would be to find out. An then some parts might even demand some genetic engineering. In which case they'd arguably be no longer human. ;-) 

You need some advanced metallurgy to purify the uranium. The base chemicals for that are not very difficult to make, if you know how. Enriching the U-235 is out of the question, that's really high tech. To run the reactor with present-day isotope ratios, you need heavy water. That's much easier than enriching heavy elements, albeit still very cumbersome. $URL$ 

(The following assumes "proper" artificial gravity, i.e. that is, as long as you do not try to move the source, indistinguishable from real gravity. Not sth. which is directed, like the electric field in a capacitor.) Basically, the graviational field of a point-like source decays with square of the distance, of an infinite rod linearly with distance, and of an infinite plane is constant. For a finite-size ship, that's still approximately true as long as you're significantly closer to the source than to the edge of the source. You surely want the gravity gradient to be small on the length of a human body to avoid a lot of upturned stomachs. ;-) That rules out a point source, because you have to stay far away from it, and you have to make it dangerously strong. A rod-like source would still mean a huge inaccessible space in the center of your ship, and it's unclear to me how you would hold it, because it would still crumble any construction material in close distance. So the most sensible, economic idea is probably a flat generator, with a pyramidal multi-story ship on one or both sides. Make the pyramid a bit higher to add rooms with lower gravity. The generator tiles in the outer area are turned up a bit, so you don't have to tilt the floor too much in that area. That's also the big problem with adjustable gravity (unless you do it ship-wide): If your neighbour thinks he wants to sleep at $0.6g$ tonight instead of the regular $0.8g$, your glassware falls out of the cupboard, not to mention the danger of the same cupboard falling onto you. As to the absolute $g$ value, that's totally in your hand. If the generator running costs are cheap, go with $9m/s^2$. Otherwise I'm sure humans would do fine with 5 or even 4. Maybe have a gym with higher gravity on the other side of the plane and lock your spacefarers in there for one hour on every weekday.
