Hydrocarbons are primordial. IOW, hydrocarbons like elsewhere in the solar systems are here since the planet's birth. The earth was subjected to only a partial melt. Hydrocarbons are stable to great depth. High pressure greatly stabilizes hydrocarbons against thermal dissociation. Rock at depth contains pores. Primordial hydrocarbons are still upwelling from the deep earth. 

some sub-points worthy of mention: It more adequately explains why Helium is only present in the earth at any mine-able quantity in natural gas. There are no pure Helium wells. Why the strong association of hydrocarbons with Helium, an inert gas that can have no chemical interactions with fossil organic materials or with hydrocarbons? This is known to geologists as the "Petroleum Paradox" and cannot be explained at all by a sedimentary origin of hydrocarbons. The presently accepted theory of fossil fuels is that the hydrocarbons formed from the decayed remains of ancient organic matter (fossils) that somehow sank down into the deep earth and got trapped in sedimentary rock formations where increased pressures assisted in converting the organic material over time to hydrocarbons. Well, hydrocarbons are found in depths where no surface life remains could have possibly geologically submerged to. The physics of how the ancient organic materials or the resulting hydrocarbons sank deep into the earth have yet to be explained. Also, hydrocarbons have been found in igneous rock formations, which the accepted surface to sediment theory cannot explain. Can we still say that fossil fuels are really from fossils? 

An older travel book (1855),A Handbook for Travellers in Spain: Andalucia, Ronda and Granada, Murcia ... By John Murray (Firm), Richard Ford discussing the site says: 

So in a region which is warmer, both air and ocean temperature, this monsoon effect is apparently predicted to be altered accordingly, resulting in either a higher precipitation, or longer duration to the wet cycle, to effectively make this region wetter than it is today. Without knowing more about how the models were derived, this is just speculation however. 

The picture below (same source) showing the rounding and frosting effects on some of the more common green and white colors. 

Since you asked for an intuitive explanation, my thoughts would be that due to predicted increasing sea and global temperatures, the models used might be predicting a corresponding increase in monsoonal moisture or duration. From Climate of India : 

In atmospheric dispersion modelling the deposition velocity of particulate matter is often described by: $$ v_d = \frac{1}{r_A+r_B+r_A r_B v_g}+v_g \hspace{10mm}(1) $$ where $r_A$ is the aerodynamic resistance (describing turbulent fluxes in the surface layer), $r_B$ is the viscous resistance (molecular diffusion in the quasi-laminar sublayer) and $v_g$ is the terminal fall velocity of the particles. How is $(1)$ derived? It is used in numerous models but I haven't found any references explaining how the expression is derived. The closest I've found is in this book by Seinfeld and Pandis (ISBN: 9781118947401), chapter 19. There, it is explained that $(1)$ is derived from the following system of equations describing the total flux through an assumed constant flux layer: $$ F = \frac{C_3-C_2}{r_A} + v_g C_3 = \frac{C_2+C_1}{r_B} + v_g C_2 = \frac{C_3-C_1}{r_t} \hspace{10mm} (2) $$ where $C_3$ is the particle concentration at the top of the surface layer, $C_2$ is the concentration between the surface layer and the viscous sublayer and $C_1$ is the concentration of still airborne particles at the surface. At this stage it is assumed all particles close to the surface will adhere to the surface so that $C_1$ is practically 0. Then $(2)$ can be simplified to: $$ \frac{C_3}{r_t} = \frac{C_3-C_2}{r_A} + v_g C_3 = \frac{C_2}{r_B} + v_g C_2 \hspace{10mm} (3) $$ By elimination of $C_3$ and $C_2$ from $(3)$ one is supposed to end up with $(1)$, since $v_d=r_t^{-1}$. I've tried doing this but end up with this instead: $$ v_d = \frac{1}{r_t} = \frac{1}{r_A+r_B+r_A r_B v_g} + \frac{v_g}{r_A(\frac{1}{r_B}+v_g) +1} $$ So either my algebra is a bit rusty or there are additional assumption involved... 

Bark Beetles. The deep chambers are the 'nuptial' chambers where the larvae hatch. If you zoom in close you can see the small trails leaving the edges of the deep cuts, as well as the numerous larger paths swirling all around. Some drawings in this paper show the particular 'hook' pattern on some of your images. I haven't found the exact species however. UPDATE: Found the species: Fir Engraver Scolytus ventralis LeConte According to this US Department of Agriculture-Forest Service document: 

Another source, The Lakes Handbook: Lake Restoration and Rehabilitation edited by Patrick O'Sullivan, C. S. Reynolds, (pg 179) agrees with this figure (emphasis mine): 

Yeddo seems to be a version of Edo, which is today Tokyo. Though it has had its share of disasters, nothing seems to come up concerning any storms in the 1864. Fires and earthquakes seem the more typical catastrophes. A horrible fire in 1857 seems to be the closest event timewise that I find. It was apparently still in existence in 1868: 

Hydrocarbons have been found in great abundance elsewhere in the solar system where there is unlikely to be evidence for life past or present. No fossils involved. Petroleum and natural gas wells that have gone dry 50 years ago, are found replenishing a fraction of their output. No fossils involved. Vast biomass of micro-organisms and extremophiles beneath earth surface estimated to be several times the size of the surface biomass found deriving their chemical energy for life from methane and oxygen pulled from sulfates and ferrous oxides. The source of methane way too deep to come from fossils. No fossils involved. These recent findings and other evidence were foretold by the late scientist and researcher from Cornell, Thomas Gold, who authored "The Deep Hot Biosphere, The Myth of Fossil Fuels". After seeing evidence of extremeophiles in relative abundance in even the deepest of mines, Gold ties the sub-surface biosphere to the "Deep Earth Gas theory" to show a more plausible primordial explanation of hydrocarbon fuel formation than the generally accepted "fossil" theory. He posits that "Hydrocarbons are not biology reworked by geology (as the traditional view would hold), but rather hydrocarbons are geology reworked by biology." In other words, as in Saturn’s moon Titan and other hydrocarbon rich areas of the solar system, the source of hydrocarbons is primordial; but as they upwell into earth’s outer crust microbial life uses it as energy source. While the details of the Deep Earth Gas Theory are beyond scope of elaboration in this question area, the main points which Dr. Gold supports, and provides evidence for are: 

From the texture shown, I would look at sea or beach glass. This article in Wikipedia on Sea Glass shows some similar features: 

Looks like a fossil coral, possible similar to the ones seen here, classified as Lithostrotionella, or Lithostrotions From Wikipedia 

So bottom line is that it is easier to measure the amount of change, then to calculate direct figures concerning how much actual water was involved in causing that change. Hope this helped. Update: There is some specific data on another page of the Nasa site concerning the volume of water being generated by the melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet: 

This does give you some approximations in gallons per year of one of the main contributors to the sea level rise. 

(some nice graphics here showing change amounts) This expansion due to warming literally changes the volume of the water, adding to the sea level rise. So glacial melt may be measured or estimated, but the change in sea level caused by this volume of water is variable; over time it will change temperature and expand. But this isn't straightforward either. Nasa again: 

After some more work I got it working, this might not be the shortest solution possible. There are no further assumptions needed, just pure algebra. The solution is a bit tedious to reach, so it's not too surprising that this is usually not included in the literature. Start by splitting $(3)$ into two separate equations $$ \begin{cases} \frac{C_3}{r_t}=\frac{C_3-C_2}{r_a}+v_g C_3\hspace{10mm}(4)\\ \frac{C_3}{r_t}=\frac{C_2}{r_b}+v_g C_2\hspace{17mm}(5) \end{cases} $$ Get $C_3$ by multiplying $(5)$ with $r_t$ and breaking out $C_2$: $$ C_3 = C_2 r_t (\frac{1}{r_b} + v_g)\hspace{10mm}(6) $$ Divide $(4)$ by $C_3$: $$ \frac{1}{r_t}=\frac{1-C_2/C_3}{r_a}+v_g\hspace{10mm}(7) $$ Insert $(6)$ in $(7)$: $$ \frac{1}{r_t} =\frac{1-\frac{C_2}{C_2r_t(1/r_t+v_g)}}{r_a}+v_g =\frac{ \frac{1}{r_b}+v_g-\frac{1}{r_t} }{ r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)}+v_g \hspace{10mm} $$ Move $r_t$ to LHS, i.e. add $\left(r_t \cdot r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)\right)^{-1}$ to both sides: $$ \frac{1}{r_t}\left(1 + \frac{1}{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)}\right) = \frac{1}{r_a}+v_g $$ Divide by $\left(1+\frac{1}{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)} \right)$ on both sides: $$ \frac{1}{r_t} =\frac{1/r_a+v_g}{\left(1+\frac{1}{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)} \right)} $$ Multiply numerator and denominator (RHS) by $r_a$ and simplify: $$ = \frac{1+v_g r_a}{\left(r_a+\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)} \right)} = \frac{1+v_g r_a}{\left(r_a\frac{(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)}{(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)}+\frac{1}{(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)} \right)} = \frac{(1+v_gr_a)(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)}{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)+1} $$ Re-organize the numerator and split it: $$ =\frac{ \frac{1}{r_b}+v_g+v_g\frac{r_a}{r_b} +v_g^2 r_a }{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)+1} =\frac{ \frac{1}{r_b}+v_g\left(r_a(\frac{1}{r_b} +v_g)+1\right) }{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)+1} =\frac{ \frac{1}{r_b}}{r_a(\frac{1}{r_b}+v_g)+1} + v_g $$ If we now move $r_b$ in the first term on the RHS to the denominator we end up with the final expression: $$ \frac{1}{r_t} = \frac{1}{r_a + r_b + r_a r_b v_g } + v_g $$ 

I don't know if this helps, but since you have no response yet perhaps I can offer some thoughts.Your question is problematic due to the fact that volume itself is variable according to the temperature of the water. If you look at the Nasa site concerning sea level change: 

An article on the National Geographic site discusses the relationship between the ocean air temperature and the monsoons in India: 

Seems to me the creation of soil may be largely due to the effects of winter. If not for the seasonal death and decay of part of plants exposed to winter conditions, soils would be less rich. Look at the soils in the tropical rain forest areas, which area relatively poor in nutrients, in comparisons to the rich dark soils of the great plains, where winter temperatures kill the surface plants, but reintroduce that vegetation into the soil to aid the growth of the soil for the next seasons growth. Another important aspect for winter is the snow, which, besides providing skiers with entertainment, provides moisture which, being retained in the snowpack late into the spring and summer, and allows life to flourish into regions which would otherwise receive little or no precipitation in the summer months.
