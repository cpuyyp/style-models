I have oracle database 11.2.0.4 on oracle linux 6.7 . I have install oracle database single instance with asm option . I have 2 users : oracle and grid My database is open and all of things are good ! I want to install oracle gateway for connecting database to sql server . This product get me an error : You can not create directory on /u01/app/grid/product/11.2.0/ASM. For resolving this error , executing the command in below : chown -R grid:oinstall /u01 chmod -R 775 /u01 After executing these commands , and rebooting server , i can not start database . My diskgroups are mounted , but i can not start database with oracle user : sqlplus sys/****** as sysdb sql > startup ORA-01078: failure in processing system parameters ORA-01565: error in identifying file '+DATA/orcl/spfileorcl.ora' ORA-17503: ksfdopn:2 Failed to open file +DATA/orcl/spfileorcl.ora ORA-12547: TNS:lost contact ...................... with grid user , the output of command in below is : srvctl start database -d orcl PRCR-1079 : Failed to start resource ora.orcl.db ORA-12547: TNS:lost contact CRS-5017: The resource action "ora.orcl.db start" encountered the following error: ORA-12547: TNS:lost contact .

You could use a cron job to connect to the existing database, make a backup of the table, select the rows you need to move (over one week old) disconnect from the sql server, connect to the new server, insert the rows you have previously selected using a loop, disconnect from the second server, reconnect to first server, and delete the rows you don't need anymore. That's one way of doing it, I don't know if it's optimal, but it would work, do not forget to plan the cron job to run Only when the first server is at its lowest usage to make sure you don't impact the performance of the live server. 

I have oracle database 11gR2 . I want to save all changes of all tables in database such as insert,update and delete values . I want to save them in a table . When i search for its solution ,find out that ORACLE AUDIT can not save data of changes . Does ORACLE have any solution for this problem ? Thanks 

I have oracle ASM 11gR2 on oracle linux 5.8 and i want to install oracle database. I have some disks and i want to use the redundancy strategies of oracle ASM or RAID 10 . I do not know which one is better ? Oracle ASM redundancy or RAID 10 ? 

I believe MySQL requires the statement to restate the column definition (datatype, default value, column constraints &c.) even if it's only the column name being changed. 

MySQL is particular about the order in which you do things in a statement. I'll be burned if I can find it in the docs right now, beyond a cursory mention under Syntax, but the order MUST BE 

Triggers are procedural, so my inclination would be to perform the join and update as separate steps; this IMHO would make for simpler and more readable DML.This code should do what you want: 

you must edit bash-profile then install oracle database . in that you can set oracle_home and oracle_sid and etc . i have similar mistake and resolve it with edit bash-profile in oracle user to real and correct values at the end , you can refer to this article , it is useful $URL$ 

I want to use this document for creation active data guard from rac database to rac database : $URL$ I do the steps in this document , all of things is ok but in step " Start the Managed Recovery Process " after i want to switch log in primary , switch log is not occurred on standby database . After " tail of alert log " on standby database and executing " Switch log " on primary , this error is occurred : 

is not part of the which precedes it, so the identifier does not refer to the column by that name but to a separate (undeclared) variable. The way to test whether the did anything or not is to test the implicit cursor attribute , as in 

Note that I haven't tried to compile this, so I make no promises regarding syntax errors, but the semantics are sound. Also, I've used a -clause join instead of a -clause join, as I'm not sure you can use the latter to join on . 

With your in place, you're attempting to declare variables after you've begun "doing stuff", which isn't allowed. Move the after the last of your s, and things should work much better. 

function so that we can add a to the sql statements within the procedure without stopping the procedure by accident. 

This procedure will create a new employee with the code being the first three characters of the name and a count of the employees already existing in the database with that same name padded to 3 characters with a dash in between. We use the 

The problem with this, is that if your column is not nullable, you can't insert a null value into it. Also, formatting invalid data doesn't make it valid. 

However, in this case your entire trigger body is a single statement, so you can omit both the statements and the directives: 

You've stumbled onto one of the imponderables of MySQL's default configuration. To quote from the documentation on Character Set Configuration: 

Jack up the security on the table so normal users can't directly access it at all, and remove the protecting trigger. Create an updatable view on the table which is accessible by normal users, and add an trigger to protect the column from updates (assuming you want it still visible; if not, simply omit it completely from the view definition.) Create a function with definer's rights which bypasses the view and directly updates the column in the base table.
