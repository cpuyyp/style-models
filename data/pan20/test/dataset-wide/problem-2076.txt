Like a lot of things, it can depend on how the company plans on using the information. Some tests have scientific support, but there are requirements and training necessary for the giving and interpreting. I don't know if the results are skewed if people are forced to take the test. In one example, a company that just hired me adjusted my responsibilities based on my personality type. They correctly assessed my aversion to repetitive tasks. Going forward, I was more inclined to believe the company was on my side and were willing to do what they could to improve the workplace. Your company may be giving it to existing employees to try and establish their own norms. I don't know if you're better off people making assumptions, limited observations, listening to gossip and having evaluations biased by their personal baggage. Some may feel a standardized test is the best way to handle large numbers of applicants or save time for hiring managers. I think they should be citing problems in their current hiring practices that they feel will get solved by using the test, but that is perceived as admitting one is wrong which some people will never do. Hopefully this won't affect your situation. 

Your CV should be about where do you want to focus the reader's attention. What gets "hidden" should be things not important to an interviewer. If you choose to lie about something, you better have a good memory and be prepared to maintain it throughout the interview process. I don't recommend it. Functional CV's are good for those without any job experience. The focus is on education, training, skills developed, projects, etc. Some people have so many experiences in a large variety of areas, that a functional CV is a more concise way to demonstrate 20 yrs of experience. For someone who does several contract jobs a year for several years, it's not important to list all of them. It would be a little more common for contract workers to have gaps I employment, so it's not to cover it up. Some CV's are a combination. Maybe the chronological part only goes back 5-10 years? Someone who has made a career change, would leave out a lot of the details about work in their previous fields. There are so many things anyone could include in their CV that could negatively affect getting a position that people leave out all the time. The goal is to omit any potential bias (we're all human). You're not applying for sainthood. 

Give a salary range. Indicate there are facts other than salary that you would like to know more about, so your needs may change depending on those. They'll assume you will not take a pay cut, so let them know you understand the current market and how your present position's salary is at the top, but you want other things: benefits, less travel, flexible time, etc. Don't feel you have to negotiate the final salary with the HR person at the early stage. You can always ask for more after you've reassessed. You may be worth more to your current employer than everyone else at the beginning. Find out how long it will take you to be evaluated for a raise. They're trying to limit their risk, but you need to know that if you prove yourself, the opportunity to make more money is available. 

By most professional definitions, this is not appropriate behavior, but you've found yourself in a situation where it is common and probably tolerated if not encouraged. Initially, I would try and ignore it. Don't laugh at these jokes, join in or give any indication you think this is appropriate. After you work there for a while and observe how management behaves, you can start to adjust your reactions. The more the management encourages this, you have to be careful how strongly you voice how much this offends you. Some people will respect your views and try to control themselves around you. They won't be perfect all the time, so try to excuse the rare infraction. You may find yourself being the target of further bullying or they may just see you as not fitting into the corporate culture. That would be a shame especially if you do your job well. You may have to eventually make a formal complaint to cover yourself. Hopefully, this situation won't escalate. 

Yes, most email communication between workers has limited text, but that doesn't mean you have to change what you do unless you get some critical feedback. I suggest you don't concern yourself with why people do this and what does it mean. Think of email as emotionally neutral and many people prefer an "economy" with their words. Bluntness can carry some negative connotations like not caring about hurting other's feelings. Phone conversation etiquette/what is considered rudeness has evolved over 100 years. Are they lazy, don't care or have poor keyboarding skills? I prefer people get to the point but provide enough information. "If you get a chance, please proof this." may be more pleasant, but I prefer "Can you proof this by tomorrow?" especially if the person is going to think I don't care since I didn't drop everything and come to their rescue. When you are emailing someone who doesn't know you, it would be appropriate to provide a meaningful introduction that explains why you are contacting them instead of just saying, "Hello my name is..." 

Any time you ask for a raise, you should be able to justify your worth. Your comments sound like you can do that. Limiting your hours is just another factor. The company's willingness to limit your hours took your productivity into consideration. Although you just made this request and are thankful they gave it to you, your salary increase (which was agreed on) has not been addressed. It's important that you recognize what they've done for you in the recent request. It is usually more difficult to get a raise after just getting some compensation in another form. Can you realistically get another job at the market rate but with your reduced hours? I'm not so sure. I'm not sure what you mean by politely asking. Have you received feedback from people that you come across as rude in your requests? If there is an issue with timing, maybe you need to wait. 

It's basically a know your audience type of advice. I once posted in my cube "Select * from people where clue >0" My boss told me to take it down because it would offend others. I would have been happy if anyone there would have figured out what it meant. Not sure why anyone would assume it was aimed at them. I was new and he had stronger relationships with people, so I figured he knew best. Pay attention to what is going on around you before doing things outside the norm. 

You have to define the project and not let some non-technical person determine it to be, "install this application so it functions perfectly with existing system." Maybe you indicate what the manufacturer suggests are the steps of a typical install. Once you have to include additional steps, you have a new project. Upgrading the OS may be another project in itself. Document everything and/or get approval from your boss to adjust/extend the project or possibly put it off for another time so more important projects can get started. You haven't indicated what the consequences are for missing your boss's deadline. Often, bosses or any other person who doesn't truly know what it takes to complete a project (get it done by the end of the week), set a deadline because they believe if they don't, you'll just take forever and never get it done. He'll yell, moan, complain or be sad, but will probably get over it. Again, it depends on what the consequences are. 

It's unprofessional , but mainly it is a waste of time which is why it is not clever. You might get some salary ranges, but nothing like an offer until several interviews. Many jobs are posted online. I don't know if there's a huge discrepancy between requirements for jobs that go through recruiters and those that don't. Maybe for senior executive positions. How are you going to scout other companies during this process? You plan on wasting an interviewer's time and then offer him/her a job? Why aren't you involved with local groups in your profession so you really know where to find the best tallent? I think most recruiters are a poor judge of talent.
