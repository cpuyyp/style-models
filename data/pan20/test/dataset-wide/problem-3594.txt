The short answer to your question, if using arm can result in fat loss in belly and legs, is yes, it can. To lose fat you need to lose overall body fat. There's no exercise targeted to lose body fat from any specific body part. So, by using your arms if you burn enough calories, it would result in fat loss wherever required and your body is quite intelligent to figure that out. Red Nick Scott's interview if you like, $URL$ He's wheelchair bound since he was a teenager, but not only he successfully lost tremendous amount of fat, he built an impressive physique as well.So, by having a control over your diet, working out regularly and having adequate rest, you can achieve any goal you want. Best wishes to you. 

At 26, most people are in their prime when it comes to how their bodies respond to workout and building muscles. Even if you haven't lifted ever, or done any kinda workout, it's not late to start, but keep in mind, you can't build a rock solid body overnight. To see any transformation, it takes a lot of dedication, hard work, focus, diet, good rest and above all, time. So, start slow, and keep on building gradually. It may so happen that you won't be happy with the results after a couple of months, but don't give up. Note your progress, and see yourself when it's around 7-8 months and then after a year. You'd definitely see the difference, if you are disciplined with your workout and diet. No, it's not late, I'd say it's a good time to start. 

It won't do much damage to the bar. The bar is your case supported on 2 ends, rather than it's weight distributed all along it's length. Bar is just 45 lbs, and it's not carrying any additional weight, when the plates touch the ground. Having said that, if you rack the weights on a bench press bar raised above the ground by the support, the load on the bar would be immense, which is equal to the bar's load and load of the plates. The concept of moments in physics applies to it. 

3 months is not big enough a time for a beginner to see changes. In 3 months you hardly build 2-3 pounds of muscle mass, no matter what supplement you use, and that 2-3 pounds will be distributed all over your body, so it will hardly make any difference to human eye. To see any transformation, it will take at least a year of dedicated effort. If you stick to your schedules, eat and rest well, you'd add up 6-10 lbs(remember, it's not a linear growth) of muscle mass in a year. Not that you'd look like a competition athlete, but you can see the change. Now, if you continue, by the end of 2nd or 3rd year, you'd be able to see the real transformation when you add up to 20-25 lbs of muscle mass. Supplements as the name suggests, are there to supplement your food intake, they are not main food sources by themselves. If you are not eating right, there's nothing much they could do. Food along with supplements, would provide you the proper benefit. 

If you are aiming for drop-sets, you have to do it immediately after the heavy lifting. It's same as cheating reps, or with some support from a spotter. Usually you lower it by 30-40%(depends on individuals how much weights they lower) and do a few more reps. That being said, if you are already done with your 90kg press for 12, dropping it to 40 and doing 4-5 more or even 7 is fine, but if you are aiming 12, it depends on what your point of failure is. If they could sustain another 12 at lower weights or not, only you could find out by doing it. Personally, I do drop-sets for arms, because it's easy and you can switch to low weights easily on machine or picking up the right dumbbells. In case of bench press, by the time you remove the plates, you'd have already taken 30-40 seconds of break, unless you have a spotter to help you. So it's same as doing another set with lower weight than doing drop-sets(which by definition is doing things right after), unless that's what you aim for. That's more like doing lower reps for the pump, but that can't be categorized as a drop-set. 

Muscles don't come that easily. Getting ripped means you have to shed a lot of body fat and gain muscles at the same time. Also, your body's appearance depends on genetics to some extent. There are some sources that claim that some people added like 50lbs of muscles in a month. That's not true to any extent. It's marketing trap. No matter how hard someone tries, body's natural tendency would only enable you to put on 6-10 lbs of muscles a year. So, so see around 20 lbs of muscles you need to workout for at least 2-3 years, eat well and also keep your fat percentage maintained. Above all, I'd say being and feeling fit matter more than looking good, but that's my opinion. 

With proper form? Yes, they may lead to injuries, if you are attempting to lift more than what your body is capable of, or doing explosive movements without proper stretching and warmup. Everyone is different and the way our bodies respond to different exercises differ from person to person. To prevent injuries, we need to keep in mind how much we are loading ourselves. Loading should be done progressively, and with proper care. If I want to overload 100lbs more in a week as a beginner, then I'm just asking for injuries, no matter how good my form is. Also, regarding explosive moments, yes, injuries may happen if not done under correct supervision. The problem with explosive movements is, sometimes it throws the form out of the window. We just get carried away and call injuries in. Does that mean we should give everything up? No, the idea is to make our bodies able enough to handle those. With nutrition, rest, and taking it easy, and doing things progressively. When our muscles and tendons are strong enough, they can withstand the explosiveness, but don't forget to warm then up with light movements and do enough stretching to make them prepared for what coming next. 

That depends on your training. If you focus only on cardio, there are chances you may lose muscles mass over long run. Muscles feed on calories, so they need constant feeding in order to maintain the mass. Sometimes what feels like muscle loss, is lack of glycogen in muscles. So once you eat right and workout, they will gain size again. Without strength training/resistance training, you won't be able to maintain the muscle mass in long run. 

It's hard to conclude. As you have already mentioned, people have different body types, also they follow different workout and diet plans. For examples, soldiers, gymnasts, track athletes. All hey do, are free hand workouts, and they are all different when it comes to what they do in their respective workout times, and their body shapes differ. Even 2 people following the same set of exercises won't look the same. If you want to find in general, you can look up some links, but that would be again the author's perception, not something that could be used as a guideline. 

Do not do any self-diagnosis. Consult a musculoskeletal specialist and get yourself diagnosed. Never assume anything, as similar symptoms may be because of different reasons.If given proper attention at the right time, any issue can be fixed. 

If you pick the right source, you'd get ample amount of protein. There are also supplements for protein, but those are just to compensate what you lack from your food. Your primary aim should be to eat good. Nuts, tubers, certain grains, soy, veggies would help you attain your protein requirements, but remember, your diet should consist of all nutrients in proper amount. Body grows when it gets overall nutrition, not just protein. Just eat proper and workout. There are many vegan bodybuilders, if you want to look up see what they eat, that may help as well. 

Human mind is not designed to do 2 things at a time. You may have heard people multi-tasking, but in reality, they are just switching focus between 2 things. What they claim as multi-task, is actually jumping back and forth between 2 tasks. As a result, productivity suffers at both ends. This may not apply to your situation fully, but if you are watching TV, you are focusing on the show, not on the workout. I'm not saying there isn't any benefit at all, but not as much as a fully-focused workout regime could deliver. There are also chances you may hurt yourself. I know 10 lbs is not much, but good enough to hurt if you drop them by accident. Why not to take a break from TV while they show those funny ads, and get pumped during that time? 

Apart from what others have mentioned above, in my own experience, pull-ups help a lot in building forearms.They are quite beneficial in building forearms, because forearms do major work there. 

Yes, it does. Higher temperature acts as a catalyst when it's comes to your body's energy expenses. Your body does spend more calories, and loses energy faster compared to when it's cold. Lowering of the pace would result in maintaining the balance with high temperature environments. I don't know the exact figures, but on a very hot day performance degrades on a long run. Short sprints may not be affected by the temperature though. Having said that, 50-60 F would be average or ideal temperature for the body while working out. What I said above applies to 90F and above. 

"Lower weights,more reps(like 15-20 reps) and slower+controlled movement to get defined" Not necessarily, definition comes from lesser fat surrounding muscles.All you need to do is, get rid of the fat, and if you don't see the result, that means you have to build up muscles. That's simple. I have known several instructors giving the low rep advice for cutting, but that really doesn't help. Though, that's not a good advise, but that's what they have heard from their mentors and instructors as a guideline, and pass it on to others. In this age of information, we have the access to knowledge at our finger-tips, so many old age body building myth are debunked. Rather doing cardio and weights training together for definition would be a good idea. Also, eating right and clean is very necessary. 

Training to prepare yourself for the race is different, and training to beat the time is different. During recovery, your muscles need to gain back the condition they were in. If your focus is to condition your muscles and keep your body prepared, then you don't need to run the whole distance to make it happen.In order to beat the time, you need to keep your last performance in mind. If you have covered the whole thing in 19:30, then it should be around that. Bettering the time doesn't mean you have to beat it every time you run, but to have a day or 2 in the training where you aim to do that. If you are able to finish around the targeted time, then you'd have the level of confidence to get yourself through. Remember, training yourself for marathons is not just limited to training the body, but mind as well.
