A very powerful, but often overlooked way of discouraging excessive overtime is to offer people flexible working hours. If you have a system in place for flexi-time, then people are both careful to accurately record their working hours, so that they don't lose out on accumulating flexi hours, and mindful of the hours they are working. An example flexi-time system might have core hours of 10:00 to 16:00, allow an employee to accumulate up to 3 days (24 hours) of flexi-time, or go into one days flexi-time debt, but require that they take no more than 2 days (or 4 half days) of flexi-leave (time off within core hours) per month without taking annual leave. It may seem counter-intuitive, but psychologically, if you are getting close to the upper limit on the hours you can accumulate, you start thinking "if I work too many more hours, I'll lose them at the end of the month", so you start to cut down. 

Yes, in my experience this is common practice, but I don't think it is as deceitful as it first appears. You don't burn your bridges, either as a an employer or potential employee and sometimes, recruitment takes a while. You can genuinely want someone, but then find someone else is a better fit for business or operational reasons. Reading between the lines of what you heard from the VP and the recruiter though, I would say that all this means is that you are currently second choice on their list. They are probably waiting to hear back from someone (possibly via a different recruiter) with slightly more experience than you. You are probably their best culture fit, while someone else is their best experience fit. They want to keep you sweet because they are confident that you can do the job, even if it takes a little longer to give you the extra skills they think you need. They want to maximise the chance that you will still be available and interested if their first choice doesn't accept their offer. With respect to the recruiter, they are probably playing down your chances to stop the recruiter calling them every five minutes nagging them for an offer. They probably don't care about keeping the recruiter sweet, so depending on how aggressive the recruiter is, they might say anything to get them to stop calling. From personal experience, I have missed out on a number of jobs where people have very apologetically phoned me to say "I'm really sorry, I think you would have been great here, but we really didn't expect to find anyone who had experience with X, Y and Z.". People can be genuinely complementary and want you, but circumstances beyond their control might push them towards another candidate. Essentially, someone who can hit the ground running will usually be preferred over someone who will take a while to get started, even if they may end up being a better team player in the long run. So, don't give up hope, keep looking, and try to assume the best of people rather than the worst. 

A while ago, a recruiter on LinkedIn reached out to me and we discussed a position. I interviewed and it looks like they are making an offer. I'm not necessarily in a rush to leave my company, but the offer is very good. But I like the company culture, the people, the commute, everything (well, my job itself isn't as great as it could be but I think there's a path forward to improve that.) If I was being paid this amount at my current company then I would outright decline the offer. Most advice I've seen is "don't ask for a counter offer" but that seems to be geared towards people who are actively looking to leave a job. Does that advice apply in this situation? I'd love to stay at my job but this offer is very enticing. 

Almost 2 months ago, my manager left the company. My group reports directly to the CEO, so I was made acting Director, reporting to the CEO. It looks like I'll be in the position for somewhere between 4-6 months while we search for a replacement. My day job is an engineer, not a manager. I would love to list the position of acting Director on my resume but I'm not sure how to list it. 

The nice thing about doing this is that it actually demonstrates your loyalty to a potential employer. If you were prepared to do this for your old employers, they can be more confident that you won't leave them in the lurch either. Plus, the idea of a new hire being immediately productive (supporting the bottom line) is actually quite appealing when normally you expect new hires to have a significant period of being a net drain on productivity. 

You can't stop recruiters being unethical, at most you can frustrate their efforts. Ditching Word documents for PDFs was a good first start, but even if you use PDF's there's nothing to stop them ripping the text out of it and creating their own Word document of it's contents. Also, if they have the right software, they can even edit your PDF before sending it on. One approach might be to digitally sign your PDF CV and use the option to prevent text being copied from it, this may make life more difficult for prospective employers too though - if they want to copy particularly relevant details for quick reference. The best option might be to tailor your CV for every application, which is common job hunting advice anyway. That way, no one recruiter has all of your CV and double presentation might be less of a problem because there is an obvious difference between the generic CV and the tailored CV. Combining these, you could provide signed, tailored CV's which can still be copied from. If a prospective employer asks why two CV's have been presented to them, ask them to check the signature so that they can see which one is the genuine application and which is the fraudulently presented one. This might even make the company think twice about using the unethical recruiter again in the future. 

How should I represent this experience on my resume? (FWIW, I talked to the CEO about potentially applying for the full position - while he appreciates the work I've done in the director role, I just don't have enough experience to be qualified for the full position. I actually agree with the assessment.) 

I'm part of an interview panel this week. I have only ever given a structured interview before (all panelists have a list of the same questions, and we use the same questions for all candidates; cannot lead the candidate; etc), whereas now I am being asked to evaluate the candidate for cultural fit, interest in the position (this is "just a conversation", we reached out to the candidate and do not have an actual open position), etc. I have the freedom to run my 1:1 interview however I see fit. We would consider the candidate for a hardware design engineering position at a startup firm. In searching around on Workplace.SE, there's lots of input about what to expect as an interviewee, but not an interviewer. I want to ask good questions that properly evaluate the candidate without leading or otherwise biasing the process, and actually add value to our hiring process. (I also don't want to provide a bad candidate experience that might lead to a post on Workplace.SE!) What types of questions should I ask the candidate? 

Note that since you have no formal contract and thus presumably haven't been given your written statement of employment particulars then you are perfectly at liberty to require one of your current employer, if you have been there more than a couple of months. This doesn't necessarily have to give away the fact that you are job hunting. You could approach HR and say "Hi, I've just been catching up on paperwork at home and realised that I never received my copy of my contract or employment particulars. Could you get them to me as I should have got them within two months of starting". If they refuse or delay your request, then you can remind them that it is a legal obligation on both of you, and that you would really feel more comfortable if your working relationship were on a solid legal footing. 

In the European Union, you have to be careful that employees do not end up working longer hours than is allowed by the European Working Time Directive. Except in the UK (where you can agree to waive, in writing, your rights under the WTD) member states must ensure weekly working time is limited by law, or collective agreement and average working time should not exceed 48 hours for each 7 day period during the reference period of 4 months. Incidentally, in order to comply with this directive, employers in Europe are effectively forced to keep track of employee working hours. In the UK, I have known business to request that employees opt out of the WTD not so they can work longer hours, but to remove the requirement for hours to be tracked, reducing the administrative burden on both the employee and the company. 

I'm almost 2 months into an internal transfer. I found a position on our internal careers site, applied, and was accepted. The company paid for relocation, including a hefty cost-of-living adjustment. I took this position both for personal and career reasons - the position seemed more in line with my career aspirations. Now that I'm 2 months in, I am pretty unhappy with the position. Without getting too specific, I think that the job was oversold to me and I'm not doing the design/analysis work I thought I would be doing. Right now I've been given just a bunch of grunt work. Other coworkers my age are in the same boat, and they've been around for between 1-2 years. There is a bad dynamic in the group where the senior engineers are not giving us young guys enough background or training to do anything more useful than relatively menial tasks. Based on the others' experiences and on my own observations of how this group operates, I don't think my skills, experience, or career will grow if I stay here. I believe I was sold a false bill of goods, and management did not act in good faith when they told me I would be doing design/analysis of systems. Per my relocation contract, if I leave for any other reason than layoff due to reduction-in-force before 1 year I am liable to pay back the entire relocation bonus. My current plan is to put in notice the day I am eligible to do so, but I am so unhappy that I'm considering moving on now. Do I have any leg to stand on to try to keep relocation by saying I was not hired in good faith? Generally speaking, are there any circumstances where it's possible to keep a relocation benefit like this?
