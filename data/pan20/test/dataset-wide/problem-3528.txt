Low-intensity exercise is more effective in the short run. Since you can keep going much longer, you can (potentially) burn more calories, which (in the short run) is better for fat loss. In the long run, however, low-intensity exercise has only limited adaptive effects. That is, it doesn't make you that much fitter, it doesn't change how your metabolism works very much, but it mostly induces a one-time calorie deficit every time you do it. High-intensity exercise is more effective in the long run. Although you (usually) burn less calories, especially as a beginner with low stamina, high-intensity training is a challenge to your body which, over time, leads to an adaptive response. The exact details are not well understood, but the idea is that your body "learns" that it has to face periods of extreme stress, and thus tries to adapt to that stress. Just like your biceps will grow when you do lots of biceps curls, your aerobic exercise capacity (and also stress capacity) will grow when challenged. Low-intensity exercise is like doing biceps curls with an empty soda bottle: It may be enough to prevent muscle loss, but it's not enough of a challenge to induce an adaptive response. If you truly want to improve, you need to get out the heavy weights. Since the adaptation takes a while, however, you will feel worse for a few hours or even days after an intense workout, while you'd feel better after a less intense workout. Similarly, your biceps will become weaker shortly after exhausting it with heavy weights, but that's the only way to make it stronger in the long run. Conclusion: Low-intensity if all you want is to work off the turkey after Thanksgiving. High-intensity if you have patience and want to induce fundamental adaptations which make you stronger, leaner, faster, more stress-resistant, and so on. 

Depends on what you mean by "aging better". Aging has a lot of different aspects, for example the loss of health (e.g. increased cardiovascular risk), loss of physical fitness, and deterioration of physical appearance. There is no question at all that exercise prevents age-related health problems, and there are countless studies on that subject. Here's a study showing that exercise reduces cardiovascular risk. The same is true for physical fitness: Obviously exercise helps you stay fit as you age, since that's the main purpose of exercise in the first place. Perhaps you are more interested in the age-related effects on appearance, i.e. does exercise help us look young as we age? This is a more complex topic, since appearance is fairly hard to measure. One part of it is wrinkles, and I would argue that staying muscular is definitely a great way to prevent body wrinkles, by keeping the skin tight. In addition, skin hydration is a big factor in preventing wrinkles and exercise keeps you and your skin hydrated by strengthening your heart and improving your blood circulation. Another part is how "healthy" you appear in terms of your skin tone, which is also affected by cardiovascular strength (blood circulation) and as such definitely associated with exercise. Yet other parts are your stress-resistance, energy levels and emotional stability (sort of your "behavioral appearance"), all of which may decrease with age, and all of which are significantly improved with physical exercise. 

I think we need to distinguish between different goals here. If muscle mass in general is what you want to maximize, compound exercises help you work as many muscles as possible with a single exercise. This is why they are recommended: Most people want to build all their muscles, not just one or two in particular. If biceps mass is what you want, and you are not interested in anything else, then I'd agree that you may as well do barbell curls, or other isolated biceps exercises, and those may be more effective for your particular goal. I don't think it's credible to suggest that compound exercises are better if you simply want a huge biceps; it's just that most people want more than that. Some people (perhaps the guys in the video) may think that compound exercises are better no matter what, but that's not true. When experts recommend compound exercises, there's an implicit assumption that huge arms are not your only goal. Also, most would argue that compound exercises are not necessarily more effective, they are more efficient. They allow you to work out lots of muscles in a fairly short amount of time, while isolated exercises will take a lot more time for a similar effect (to have all muscles covered). Of course this is irrelevant if you only want to work one particular muscle. Other benefits of compound exercises include: 

I could give you more studies, but I think you get the point. The notion that eggs are bad for your cholesterol is simply false. Conclusion: Eat all the eggs you want! 

It's not a very specific question, it's basically like asking whether it's necessary to wear running shoes to run a marathon.. the answer is no, but it's a lot harder with leather boots, and even harder without shoes. Unless you can't afford the running shoes, or you made some sort of silly bet, there's really no point in going barefoot. Also, understand that bodybuilding supplements a not one generic product; supplement is a very broad term that includes many different substances, all of which have unique features. Some supplements are effective, some of them are a waste of money, but talking about supplements in general does not make a lot of sense. It's like asking whether food needs spices. Well, no, not necessarily, but so what? 

Adopt a combination of HIIT and strength training. Don't run 8km every day, it's completely useless and simply wears out your body for no good reason. You need to get your testosterone up to build muscle and reduce fat. I don't know if you're male or female, but it doesn't matter. The only way to do that is with exercise of very high intensity. Avoid moderate or low intensity exercise. By strength training I mean heavy weights and such. Burpees and situps will not do. The reason you have too much fat is not because you're not doing enough: it's because what you're doing is completely wrong and not at all consistent with your goals. By running long distances, you are conditioning your body for endurance, not strength. You're also conditioning your body to hold some fat reserves, since fat reserves are needed for long-distance running. If you want to be strong and skinny, you need to condition yourself to be a fighter, and fighters have no reason to run around for miles every day. 

If you look closely, you will notice that at the bottom of the label it says "Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily values may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs." So that clarifies the DV value for protein. As for micronutrients, the DV is based on the RDI (recommended daily intake) value, which represents the "average daily nutrient intake level that meets the requirements of 97-98% of healthy individuals in every demographic in the United States". So even for most bodybuilders, the micronutrient DVs should be sufficient. Note, however, that these RDI values are not based on the current RDA (recommended daily allowance) values, but the older RDA values from 1968. As such, they are not very accurate. The newer RDA values are not printed on food labels, but can be found online, and they are listed separately based on age and gender, but not weight or activity. The RDA is based on the "requirements of 97-98% of healthy individuals in each life-stage and gender group". Differences between RDI and RDA are substantial, e.g. the RDI recommends 60mg of Vitamin C per day, while the RDA for males ages 19-30 recommends 90mg per day. The "97-98%" are not arbitrary, by the way: it captures people up to 2 standard deviations above the average, assuming adequate intake is normally distributed. The reason for the confusion is that the RDI values (on food labels) are regulated by the FDA, while the (more accurate) RDA values are regulated by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), and these two don't always agree. Generally speaking, and this is purely subjective, the FDA is much more influenced by political pressure and corporate interests, while the IOM is considered to have higher scientific credibility. Of course there are studies claiming that certain micronutrients have an added value beyond both the RDI and RDA, but the evidence for these claims has generally not been considered strong enough to increase either value. Whether it makes sense to take a certain micronutrient at a dose above the RDA should be carefully considered on an individual basis, based on current research. If you believe that scientists have an exact model describing how factors such as physical activity, weight, muscle mass, etc. affect the recommended intakes of any micronutrient, I have to disappoint you. In most cases, these relationships are simply unknown, and you have to make do with the RDA values. For many micronutrients, not even an RDA is known, but only an AI (adequate intake), which is not much more than an educated guess how much people should take.
