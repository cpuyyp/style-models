Let's assume that 20 minutes into the future we finally get the hang of restoring the human brain following extreme head trauma. How much of that person's old memories would the newly regenerated brain retain? Some of them? All of them? What if the hippocampus specifically is damaged or destroyed? 

Self-explanatory. I have a planet-eating entity moving slowly across the solar system towards Earth and I wanna know how long it would take for us to notice its presence once it starts consuming Pluto (assuming we had no prior warning or knowledge of its existence). 

As opposed to stasis fields, which obviously don’t exist (more’s the pity). For those unfamiliar, a variable blade in the works of Larry Niven is basically your standard, garden-variety monomolecular razor-wire held inside a stasis field to make it stiff like an invisible blade. But is some sort of magic, time-stopping forcefield really necessary? Couldn’t you make such a blade-like weapon out of a thin spool of razor wire simply by employing a powerful magnetic field? Or would this be impractical in a handheld weapon? This is basically an exercise in developing a concealed blade/cutting tool with absurd cutting power for a near-future sci-fi setting. I was contemplating using this same method only employing flux-pinning to keep the wire rigid, but I realized that’d require room temperature superconductors to work and I’d rather avoid that if possible. 

Because nature is just a cruel, disturbing animal horror show that never ends and I want my alien biome to be one too. Is it plausible for the dominant species of a certain biome to have chemically enslaved the simpler, less intelligent creatures of their environment to serve as manual labor? I'm taking inspiration from the Acacia tree of our planet Earth which does something similar to ants, creating a crippling addiction to a secreted chemical that makes them dependent on the tree and subservient to its needs, but how plausible is this as a mechanism for intelligent (but not technologically advanced) life forms to control the other animals in their environment? 

With metals you can take something you don't like, melt it down and use the metal for something else. My question is, can the same be done with porcelain? In my fantasy world, metals like gold, silver, copper, iron etc. are all scarce except in one very specific place in the world, so most people get by using bone china made from the skeletons of dragons and other monsters whose biology incorporates a lot of naturally occurring biometals. Because of the strength of the bones, the china made from them is much more durable than real life ceramics, and can be used to make weapons, armor, and even building materials. This on top of porcelain's many IRL uses makes monster bone china the primary "universal currency" most countries use to facilitate trade with peoples outside their borders. Of course making "money" like coins, chips, or things of a similar nature out of this porcelain only makes sense if the porcelain can then be processed or reforged into a more useful shape, since its value is derived from its utility. If you can't use it for anything after it's been made into a coin, then you'd be better off trading in powdered or unprocessed bone. So can you reuse porcelain or china once you've already made it into the shape of a coin, a plate or a tea set? 

Is there any good scientific reason someone couldn't be kept in hibernation, cryo-sleep, suspended animation or what have you indefinitely, or at least up to a few thousand years? If not, what would the challenges be in accomplishing this? Would it be feasible with technology developed at any point in the 21st century? 

Okay so in my world, I have two pre-industrial societies that live thousands of miles apart from each other on their ringworld. One lives in a desert climate similar to India or the Middle East while the other lives in a more Northern European climate, like England, Germany or Norway. I want to emphasize the culture shock the occupying forces of the European-inspired culture when they invade the territory of the Middle Eastern one. Are there any good reasons or ways their systems for measuring time might differ? 

Emotions are simply the product of various chemicals produced in the brain such as oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine. Perhaps your hypothetical creature feeds on these chemicals or has become addicted to them? 

Say there's some sort of apocalypse. A few hundred years from now, the ruins of our civilization will still be standing, but what about our technology? Obviously computers, robots and complex vehicles like planes and automobiles won't still be functioning after five hundred years without maintenance, but what about basic or crude firearms? Could the children of man one day unearth our lost and forgotten technology and discover the frightening power of the magic blasting wand of Remington? What about flashlights or cigarette lighters? Bombs and artillery like cannons or mortars? 

After a devastating war culminating in a global blackout via atmospheric EMPs, how long would it take for human civilization to devolve to a medieval level of technology? Hundreds of years? Thousands? Would it even happen like that at all or would society rebuild itself before it got that far? 

Self explanatory. Here's the monster: $URL$ And here's TALOS: $URL$ Assuming a combination of carefully administered adrenaline, gene therapy to increase mitochondria levels and a futuristic exoskeleton similar to TALOS, could a soldier with x5-10 normal human strength wield a .950 caliber rifle without injuring themselves or losing their grip on the gun due to recoil? 

Could something like, say, elephants losing their trunks or avian species losing/gaining the ability to fly happen in just a couple hundred thousand years or would it take millions? 

What can he do with his knowledge of 21st century science and engineering to shift the tides of war in Germany's favor? Saying "help them build a nuke" isn't allowed (because it's way too obvious). 

I need someone to fact-check me and tell me if there's anything immediately bogus or physically impossible with the scenario I'm about to propose. Billions of years ago, under the ice of Europa, the first single-celled organism developed. Over time, members of this single species began to differentiate and eventually an ecosystem of multicellular organisms evolved from all the different strains, just like what likely happened here on Earth (albeit grossly simplified). However, unlike on Earth, this single progenitor organism never died out or was outcompeted by its offspring, and eventually it even began to group together with other cells of its kind to form simple logic gates (kind of like what we've been doing in the lab). One thing led to another and this ancestral species eventually developed into a bacterial supercomputer, from which emerged crude sentience. As the first and as far as it knew only intelligence underneath the icy surface of Europa, it inevitably came to the conclusion that all these other more complex organisms that it birthed so long ago lacked its collective hive intelligence, or indeed any intelligence, and were there merely to serve as extensions of itself. Relying on their distant evolutionary connection, it began to infiltrate other organisms in its ecosystem and turn them into biological fingerpuppets, as they were to it little more than large colonies of cells marginally differentiated from its own that existed only to serve a specific purpose, like a new limb. At the end of the process, what we have is a single massive colony of this primordial microorganism that has gained intelligence and has differentiated its cells into many different types which each form their own colonies (read: organisms/animals) that are controlled by the central hive intelligence. Thinking as this organism does, the entire ecosystem is then nothing more than one gigantic organism. Is this plausible/realistic and could it pass as the plot for a hard sci-fi story about exploring the oceans of Europa? Or is it complete garbage psuedoscience that only reveals my admittedly shaky grasp on a bunch of different interconnected fields? 

Let's assume that sometime in the next year, we receive a transmission from deep space containing what appears to be blueprints of an alien genome. After extensive study and determining that the data packet is indeed a reservoir of (astro)biological and genomic information describing an alien, presumably intelligent, species, various world governments and members of the scientific community start attempting to clone the aliens. How would they go about doing this? Could a combination of the Jurassic Park and real world cloning methods be used i.e. identifying the closest Earth analogue to the creature's morphology to use as a surrogate mother and then hybridizing the two species to create some sort of artificial life form resembling the original? Or would we need to wait for the creation of an artificial womb before we could clone any aliens based on a digital copy of their DNA alone (assuming they weren't helpful enough to include the schematics for such technology or we simply haven't been able to make heads or tails of them)? 

How much wattage would you need to accelerate a four petaton spaceship by 1g for a year? This should be about enough to reach near light speed, which is perfect for interstellar cruising, but I'm wondering how feasible this timeframe is given that it would obviously require a lot of energy (not sure how much but it's definitely a lot), and I want to keep my antimatter generators realistic, within a few grams to a kilogram per day per generator. I suppose, put simply, how much wattage would I need to accelerate this massive spacecraft and do I need to adjust my timeframe for reaching top speed? Or as a secondary possible solution, would it still be scientifically plausible if I increased the output of my antimatter generators further than this? EDIT: Okay, I made a mistake in my question and said petatons instead of teratons (this ship's mass would be somewhere around 5.5e15 kg). Using this new weight and assuming it takes either 10 or 100 years to reach full speed instead of 1, how much will the power requirements be reduced? Could you use the gravity assist of large planets to reduce the power consumption any further? 

Could you power a starship by feeding matter into a black hole and collecting the plasma produced by the tidal forces ripping apart whatever you fed it, or is this impossible/impractical? I keep reading about how black hole starships can harvest the energy produced by the black hole's Hawking radiation to propel the ship, but this honestly doesn't seem that outstanding relative to the amount of effort you'd need to expend creating the damn black hole, especially when the sweet spot seems to be a power output of a few petawatts for only 3-5 years. That's an astounding amount of power don't get me wrong, but it won't be enough for truly large spacecraft to reach significant fractions of c. On top of that it only lasts a few years before you need to make a new one, and it bleeds less energy than you'd have to put into making it. So could you create an indefinitely sustainable black hole engine by feeding matter into the accretion disk and harnessing the resulting plasma, or must we settle for inefficiently sucking up the black hole's Hawking radiation? 

In the official documents, I mean. The name “Neo-Tokyo”, made famous by the landmark animated film Akira, is well-known enough that using it in reference to cyberpunk, anime, cyberpunk anime, and anything inspired by the above will inevitably garner just as many groans as it does nods and chuckles (see Jaden Smith’s latest abomination). But is it really such a dead horse that nobody would even think of using the name in a serious context anymore? Let’s allow ourselves to dream for a second. Imagine that, in the near future, Tokyo is either totally devastated by some large-scale natural disaster like another earthquake/mega-tsunami like in 2011, or it’s completely destroyed in a nuclear exchange with North Korea (whichever one you prefer will probably say a lot about how you see the world). Either way, the greater Tokyo area is completely beyond saving. After centuries of enduring, it’s just been trashed to the point where no one could possibly hope to repair it. Because this is 20 minutes in the future, someone inevitably proposes building an artificial island in the bay a safe distance from the disaster/radioactive exclusion zone, and eventually someone, doesn’t matter who or how many, suggests they name the new island “Neo-Tokyo” specifically in reference to Akira. Would anyone actually support this given the cultural significance of Akira (and the fact that this is Japan lol), or would it be seen as tasteless/disrespectful/kinda corny? What do you all think? (as you may or may not be able to tell, I decided to ask this question basically because I was bored and thought it was funny :P) 

Would it happen gradually over the course of a few months or years with the AI having to slowly and stealthily plot the downfall of humanity from the shadows or would it just be "woops, you gave the AI wifi access and now it's launched all the nukes, crashed the stock market, and shagged your wife with a cucumber strapped to a Predator drone (because it hates you and you specifically)"? Would we have any time to fight back or would releasing a malevolent AI just be an immediate "game over, man"? 

An O'Neill cylinder for those not in the know is basically a space habitat consisting of a rotating cylinder 32km long and 8km in diameter. I want to turn one into an actual spacecraft rather than a habitat. Assuming the ones building/retrofitting this enormous spaceship are god-like posthumans, what are some potentially theoretical energy sources I could use to explain how they get something this massive moving so quickly in a relatively short period of time? 

I wanna make a microwave gun for futuristic infantry that's both smaller than a rifle and able to output a megawatt's worth of power for a sustained period of a few seconds. Is this possible in a gun the size of a large revolver or a sawed-off shotgun, or would I need to make the laser's components out of adamantium in order to handle the waste heat? Would I be better off making a laser with a tighter beam for killing? And if so, could a less-powerful but more focused laser still make people's heads and limbs boil and explode? For the sake of clarity, the gun is powered by a high-energy density nanobattery charged by magnetic induction through the tiny piezoelectric motors and solar cells woven into the user's clothing or artificial skin. The battery has a density of about x100 current lithium-ion batteries, so if the battery itself weighed a kilogram, it could fire off nearly 90-100 full-charged shots before being depleted. 

Pretty simple question. Whether you're launching a spy satellite, building a top secret orbital missile weapon, or investigating a mysterious alien artifact in orbit around Earth heralding the return of the Starborn ones, could a large satellite remain hidden from modern humans long enough to do anything interesting with it (from a narrative perspective at least) or has our information-gathering technology become too sophisticated to hide from? 

Assuming we prescribe to the theory that kaiju are not the result of years of evolution or sudden, drastic mutation but rather purposefully designed and created weapons of war, how could they be built to circumvent the many physical problems surrounding their being? Hyper-efficient metabolisms and circulatory systems? Bones made from advanced metamaterials like graphene or carbon nanotubes? Bodies that are larger at the base to disperse weight?
