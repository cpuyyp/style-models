You can get quick release pedals (some folding bikes use them) with the advantage that the mount point left behind is too small to effectively pedal on. Pedals are also small and relatively clean if you carry them with you, so this works fairly well. 

Buy a recumbent exercise bike instead and you'll be much more able to play games. But if you're training for serious upright riding rather than general fitness that will not be what you want. 

The easy solution is usually better brake pads. If you're using $2 brake pads, or just old worn ones, you're not going to get very good braking. Spending $10 on a pair of decent pads can make a huge difference. As well, make sure the brakes are set up properly, especially if you're using two finger (short) levers. With new cables, true wheels and minimum clearance between pads and rim you'll be able to put maximum force on the brakes. If everything is properly rigid you shouldn't see anything flex when you apply the brakes. If you do, maybe look at a reinforcing plate (called "brake bridges"). Many older U brakes already come with those. It's a U or C shaped plate than goes over the top of the brake to reinforce the pivots. They're also used with V brakes but shouldn't be necessary if the bike is built properly. Old mountain bikes and BMX's often just had U brake or V brake pivots added to a frame designed for calipers, and the tubes would bend or twist when the brakes were applied. That made the brakes no better than calipers in many cases. 

The latter is somewhat hard to get experience with, since metal pulleys are sufficiently rare and expensive that few people use them. Also, people who pay extra for them tend to maintain them so I haven't seen them fail other than via "full of mud, not going round". In that case, though, the chain will not go through the rear derailleur at all, so the bike needs to be converted to single speed before you can ride it. Which is an ugly ting to have to do when you're out on a bike ride. Note that recumbent idler pulleys have the same concerns but often they're on the drive side of the chain so the forces are larger. So are the pulleys to reduce chain bend angles and thus losses. In that case metal cogs are usually also lighter and quieter but significantly more expensive (more than double the cost). Derailleur pulleys would also benefit from being larger, but that's relatively rare, I suspect because weight and air resistance also increase with size (and a larger cog would mean extra chain, further increasing weight) 

Grease itself does has various characteristic depends on application. Unless you are going to submerge your bicycle and keep cycling, otherwise general purpose grease will do the job. Just a plain copy and paste : 

(update) You can checkout some design under wikipedia bicycle parking rack page. the easiest way is google "buy bicycle parking rack". Depends on region, there may not be "ready made" for mass bicycle parking near your local bicycle shop. You need to find workshop that fabricate those rack/stand/pole/etc. 

Since you mentioned fast and comfort, it seems a mid-drive motor pedelec ebike fit you requirements. It also help you to train and maintain your cadence. 

Stationary stand on the pedal to lighten a bump is a different story. While standing to pedal yourself up to the hill is a bad idea. Sheldon brown has write something about Standing while Cycling and how to fix it or avoid it. Putting too much pressure on the knee is how people getting sport injuries from bicycling. I just want to add one more point : knee injuries are difficult to heal. The knee Meniscus are not renewable. You need to checkout explicit instruction to train to use the muscle and tendon around the knee. 

Material fatique does happens, it is not caused by time, but due to excessive stress on usage, and/or manufacturing process and/or design fault. If all done under optimal condition, no over stress(e.g. a 120kg person ride it without suspension and under inflate tyre), a aluminium bicycle may last forever. A bang, a fall, can generate impact that stress the frame weak point. If you are not using it for long time, then the stress is little to none, discounting the stress from introduced from bolts/screw/welding joints/mounting temperature contraction/expansion. If you search around stackexchange on the same topics, there is advice that you don't put your bike under the snow : i.e. a concern about welding material contraction different than the frame. But this shouldn't be an issue as long as you didn't move the bike from very cold place to very warm place (i.e., temperature different ~ 20 degree Celsius). Consumer association with loaded funds, such as the German Stifftung Warentest, does indeed test consumer bicycle from time to time, especially for Ebike, due to ebikes are more susceptible to weight stress (the additional motor and battery weight). As some report I read, in 2013, series of ebikes are not satisfied due to the stress test. However, in 2016, many pass the stress test, with exceptional of one bike that with a cracked aluminium seatpost. So it is all about how the manufacture learn to build the bike better. In addition, it is a myth that titanium will fair better when put on stress : it is all about manufacturing process and design. 

It seems that you have through axles front and rear, most likely 15mm (the Raleigh site is unclear). The sequence for installing the wheels is shown on this Fox front fork page: 

Although they list a number of conflicting statistics on intersection fatalities (also 89% and 33%). It's rare to find that type of incident breakdown in published statistics. This page from the USA, for example, doesn't even separate fatal from non-fatal accidents when attributing fault. And they talk about cyclists breaking the law but not motorists, so (for example) if a cyclist did not have a rear reflector on their bike when a motorist T-boned them the statistics would say "cyclist breaking the law, hit by car". This is regrettably common across all analyses. 

Finally, I would check for wear on your chain and rear cog. The chainring looks fairly new, but I can't see the teeth on the cog in these photos. A worn chain could be the root cause of all your problems. 

That shouldn't be happening - it sounds as though you have the wrong hanger on the bike. If you have replaced the hanger (or a previous owner has) they have probably used one that fits on the bike but isn't correct. You may be able to file it down to fit, but it's better to buy the right hanger. For your second question, it's definitely possible to swap out a QR axle for a solid one. The threaded part of the axle is the same for both, so it's just a matter of getting a solid rear axle and swapping the bearing races and so on over. If you get that done at a bike shop they will probably suggest replacing the cones and bearings, since those are fairly cheap parts and the labour cost of taking the wheel apart is most of the cost of that swap. Once they have it apart if there's any visible wear it's worth doing, and unless the bike is fairly new I'd suggesting doing it. It should add less than $20 to the total cost. 

This contrasts with welding, where the parent metal is melted and the same or a very similar metal is added as filler. 

Yes, you need to buy a freewheel. It's almost certainly a standard one so you can go into any LBS and grab whatever they have. The main thing to know is that it should screw on easily by hand. If it doesn't you've either not got the thread started properly, or the thread is the wrong size. Ideally put a tiny bit of grease on it so it'll come off more easily when it wears out. Chain lube is better than nothing if you don't have grease. This is one of those things where it's a trivial task that takes less than a minute, but if you stuff it up you have to live without a freewheel or buy a new hub, which usually means a new wheel. So it might be worth paying a bike shop to do it (they should do it on the spot if you bring in the wheel rather than the whole bike, since it's quick and easy). Getting it off is where you need a special tool. The ratchet mechanism means that putting it on the wheel is the non-rotating direction, but getting it off means having a tool that locks on to the central, non-ratcheting part of the freewheel. 

Are there chains where it matters which side is out and which is in? I don't mean which end of the chain leads as the chain travels forward during pedaling. I mean which side is out toward the seat and ground, versus inside toward the cogs and chainrings. 

Like you, I've returned to riding after 20 years away. It's been a very rewarding journey. One thing I discovered was that I had an aversion to turning and leaning. Our neighborhood has relatively narrow streets, no markings, no shoulders, just country lanes really. I'd been practicing U-turns but they always felt wobbly and a little scary. One day, I didn't cut the turn soon enough and faced the choice of running into a mailbox or leaning hard and fast-pedaling out of it. It turned out I could safely lean pretty far, I just hadn't realized it, and it took this event to show me I could do more. Psychological barrier: eliminated. I practiced in the neighborhood for six months before I took it out on trafficked roads. This was a good thing, although I hadn't really planned to wait so long. It turned out I needed to work on myself just as much as my new-to-me used bike, mainly because I sidelined myself overdoing the hill-climbing and my knees told me to sit myself down for two months. After that, I only did what they would agree to, which was thirty minutes a day for three days a week and carrying the bike up any steep hills. This forced delay gave me time to work everything out in advance, from basic riding skills and equipment to aligning my head with the task and acquiring a high-rpm cadence habit. Only two weeks ago, at the end of November after starting in June, did I ride outside the neighborhood, on trafficked roads. Thanks to preparation, I can do longer rides now and feel comfortable. Having a great time, really. Regarding traffic, I've decided never to do left turns on busy roads. Instead, I do a right, then U-turn/turn around and cross. This feels much safer. I wonder if you haven't accepted the fact that road risks are manageable and can be reduced, but they can't be eliminated. You can get hurt, it's not up to you and once you've done all that can be done you have to not think about it. I wonder if your anxiety comes from your having not accepted it, and that part of you is trying hard to control something that can't be controlled. So perhaps part of the answer is to practice, practice, practice, then get out of your head and let your body do what it knows how to do, namely to balance. This answer has turned out just to be mostly an endorsement of what @andy256 said.
