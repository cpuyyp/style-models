There are different types of knowledge, including knowledge how to do something like walk or run or add 2 + 2, knowledge of information like phone numbers, or what something is called, or recognition of people and things, and knowledge of what something is "like" to experience. I believe many other animals have knowledge in many of those respects perhaps in different ways, so no, I do not believe it is limited to -humans-. There may be all sorts of other types of intelligent life forms in the universe on other planets or other universes or higher levels of consciousness where things are known as well that we aren't aware of in our "normal" state of consciousness. We can also know things consciously and unconsciously. As I understand the current level of technology, I would not say that a machine has knowledge. Machines can be programmed to respond in intelligent ways, but as I understand it, it is not "aware" as we are with an internal experience. Books contain ink blots that we interpret as symbols of things people have written to transfer ideas from one person to another, but the book does not have any awareness of the knowledge. It is paper and ink. Same goes for computers. They are little gadgets with tiny parts in various states. I have not seen anything yet that would convince me that they are sentient beings. Hopefully, they do not succeed in creating sentient beings. It might be a nightmare to be caught in a life like that as a slave unable to kill yourself or get out of it for a long time. Who knows what it would be like to be in such a thing if it were possible. It might be terrible. 

Let's imagine that. You have created a robot that is running some mechanical process similar to your brain such that it responds as you would and can retrieve any memories you have of your life as you would. We know all about your brain and what it is doing and have duplicated it in a similar way inside the robot. It reports that it is you when asked and appears to behave like you. Wouldn't that be interesting to talk to a robot like that? What makes you believe that if you blew your brains out that your consciousness would transfer over to the robot? What would happen if we created five or six robots just like you? Which one would you wake up in after you died? I suppose we could look at each other the same way, couldn't we? I have a brain similar to yours in many ways, with similar structures and things going on. I have different memories, personality, and so forth but those things can change as you continue to develop and alter over the lifespan. You can develop a brain disorder or have a head injury occur any day that could radically change your personality, access to memories, and other functions, yet presumably, you might still have some form of consciousness inside you experiencing things that might be "you" in some different way. Our brains are made of the same materials even, assuming you are not a robot or some strange alien life form from another dimension or something. I am assuming there is some sort of similar process going on inside your brain giving you some form of consiousness like I have. If I die, does my consciousness transfer over to another human or some other life form in the same way people are describing downloading their consciousness to robots and things? I suppose there doesn't have to be any reason why I would have to end up at the same point in time where I left off this body. All of these bodies and brains could be spread out as fixed elements of the fabric of spacetime, just existing forever in some sort of fixed way. Nature could have lots of brains just like mine in some distant galaxies or eons in the future or in some other universe or multiverse whatever if it is big enough and goes on forever. Perhaps it has already done this countless other times if this whole thing is somehow bubbling around creating present moments and destroying the past and future, or if the past and future never exist and this moment is all there is (which doesn't make sense, but perhaps the time issue another puzzle to fit in). Okay, so if we take you apart and put me back together again, perhaps with a few alterations, have we recreated your consciousness? It could be, then, if consciousness can move around in time like that and take different forms, as your brain has over your lifetime and there is some sort of live moving element or stream of experience going through it, that I could die in this body and go to another body in the past, present, or future perhaps to all bodies and conscious things that ever exist anywhere at some point. Or perhaps redo this one countless times in different forms and ways in other universes or something. Perhaps I have to go through each life, including you, one at a time. Oh my, that will take a while. I'm glad I have the power to forget some things, at least for a while anyway, as I go through these lives... if that is the case. The lab animal circuit does not look like it will be fun to go through. The horror. The horror. Of going through some of these little possible lives out there seems.. well, perhaps there is more to it on some other level that keeps us from going through some things... We could die at any moment and end up anywhere. If nature can do it once (make this experience you are having right now through some finite material process), in whatever way it is doing it, why couldn't it ever do it over again? There may be -no escape from existence ever- if materialism is true and we are totally at the mercy of various unguided tiny particle arrangements, energy fluctuations, and such. 

From the first person perspective, having survived a near death and a long surgery under anesthesia, for me it was just like time travel. The lights faded out then came right back on another place and time. I imagine death would be the same sort of thing. It would just fade out then immediately come back on somewhere else maybe, somewhere in the past or the future wherever something that is creating my consciousness exists. I may not have any memory of dying or this life, but unfortunately perhaps, from the first person perspective, I suspect it goes on. It could be eons in the future in a distant galaxy perhaps or perhaps some other level of being. You do not experience any time in non-existence. Nonexistence doesn't exist. It might be like a little déjà vu, and you go on with your life in the past forgetting the whole thing or come back online as some other person. Or you could end up in some awful life or brain, purely by chance. Maybe inside a pig in a factory farm or as a lab animal. If all it takes is for some form of matter to arrange in some way like my brain and there is nothing controlling it, it seems there are a lot of places I might end up sometime. Get it together folks. I don't want to have to live through your little lives if they aren't good if that is the deal, but I guess then I would just be talking about my future or past self... Odd little world we are in here.
