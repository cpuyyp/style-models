It appears that you can accidentally & unsafely have an unsafe occurrence with a 'Flameless ration heater'. 

Camping is an outdoor sport, with many opportunities for unexpected events. Don't bring anything that can't be exposed to the weather, and don't bring anything that will cause you emotional hardship if it does not return home with you. I have been camping for years, and have never lost anything to theft, nor has anyone I know lost anything to theft. I have had things destroyed by getting to close to the fire, ruined by water, worn out from over use, lost through misadventure, left behind accidentally, or otherwise made unavailable for future use by something stupid I have done. Apply some common sense and don't leave your wallet laying in the middle of the road. But you need not be overly concerned about theft. In the US there are two very general types of camping area, Private and Public. the private places are run for profit and almost always have people who rent (or lease) the same spot for years. The public ones are government operated and usually have a two week stay limit. In both cases, there are people who spend their whole time in camp. At any one time it would be unusual for there to be more then 2 out of 3 campsites having their occupants gone. Everyone tends to keep an eye on what is going on around them. Only a few bring a television and satellite dish. Everyone knows who belongs to what campground, all of this makes for an environment that is not good for thieves to operate in. On the other hand, a common occurrence is for someone to be away from their site and have a wind come up that is greater then the wind resistance of their tent, canopy or other item. The neighbors don't just watch your tent blow down the road, they go get it and take it back to your camp. They may or may not put it back up and secure it better, but they will at least make sure it stays in your site. 

I would generally agree with the "as few as possible approach", but would add that if it is a question of safety or avoiding lots of time wasted (which in turn may morph into a safety issue), then I think markers can be helpful. But I don't think it should be exaggerated - markers can be used instead of cairns. For example in Vistasvaggi (Vistas Valley) in North Sweden, there are fairly inconspicuous markers in the form of two half buried brick-sized red-brown rocks close to each other. I didn't understand they were markers until I had seen a few. Of course you can argue it is hard to get lost even in a wide valley and it certainly is at large scale, but I found it helpful to get the detail right when going over soggy ground, tired and damp. 

For butane/isobutane/propane canisters, the stove design, affecting the temperature in the canister or liquid feed pipe, and the boiling point of the gas mixture would matter. At very low temperatures even the O ring rubber type would matter as some types go less rubbery and do not seal properly. For instance, if the temperature of an upright butane canister drops below -0.5C/43F at sea level and one bar pressure, then the butane no longer boils/evaporates in the canister and the gas flow stops. There needs to be enough heat from a warmer place (air outside, ground or stove flame radiation) to supply energy to drive enough evaporation for cooking. Isopropane has a lower boiling point and propane a lower one yet; the temperature where a particular canister becomes impractical under normal use depends on the gas mixture. (Lower outside pressure will help a bit as the boiling point would be lower, but typically at such altitude the temperature is also lower!) A more robust winter gas canister stove solution would be one where a) The canister is turned upside down so the existing gas in the canister drives liquid fuel out of it, ie. you need very little heat directed to the canister. b) There is a heated supply pipe or heat shunt from the flame to where the fuel enters the burner, which ensures enough energy is supplied to evaporate the fuel before it reaches the burner head once the stove is started. The latter is an important safety consideration as liquid butane etc. reaching the burner would mean a lot of gas suddenly supplied to the burner as the flame evaporates it, ie. a flare-up. So upside down canisters are best used with stoves designed for that! Those features (which are unusual) should allow you to use a gas canister stove with a good mixture at -25C or a bit lower at sea level according to Backpacking Light (note only first page is subscription free). So it may be colder on the top of Everest, depending on the time, but would you be there in that case? :) 

Actually, Kamtschatka would be the one place I would really want to go to in Russia. And since it is rather difficult to get there (remoteness, special permits), it is also the one place in Russia for which I would consider joining an expedition. Other than that, I am not that familiar with what there is in the country. Well, Baikal lake, of course, but an expedition is probably not really necessary for it. Maybe Altai or Ural mountains? Maybe smth in Siberia? Assuming that it would be possible to avoid being eaten by the always-hungry Siberian mosquitos.. 

I don't know where you live, but I am pretty sure that if you want to do paragliding, you are required to take a course and get a license. So I would say if you really want to do it, find a paragliding school, and they will teach you all you need. I don't think any specific skills are required. While landings in trees do happen, they are considered crashes, and are really not an everyday occurance. I think the only thing you should think about is your general fitness level. For a take off, you should be able to run a hundred meters or so. Nothing extreme though, I have seen lots of old paragliders. 

Acquire it 6 months or less before your trip on the AT. There is some controversy but it seems you can probably count on immunity from an exposure to last 6+ months. Some of the best places to acquirer Norovirus (that are easily accessible) are daycare centers and nursing homes. Volunteering at one or more of these institutions, is win/win you get to help others, and you get exposure to the nasties before you hit the trail. If you see a cruise ship on the news, you might be able to get to the dock for unloading and acquire it there. Enjoy working through the bout of Norovirus at home, before your trip. 

I might be taking it out of context, but as I read the comment it seems to imply something I have heard previously that wet clothes in water are somehow significantly heavier than dry clothes on land. Personally I have been fully dressed in the water several times. When I was in the Army we marched fully clothed in to deep water and expected to stay alive in the water (not cold) for an hour as part of "Drown Proofing". More recently I have found myself fully dressed and treading water (with a life jacket) There is no doubt that once you get out wet clothes are heavy on land, but in water, they are just full of water, which weighs the same as water, hence it not any heavier. Often the clothes will also trap air and may add to your buoyancy. I find that clothing also tends to keep me warmer. How dangerous is swimming fully dressed in cotton/denim clothes? 

Agree with ppl, don't think it is a big problem, but even for variable filling bags it could mean that some of that expensive down may not be used the way you would prefer. A quilt may be a bit draugthy if you are not careful. I find the bottomless bags work well for 3 seasons. An(other) option there is a Rab "Backless" bag; have tried the predecessor, the Q-Top. Alternatively one could sew in a piece of thin nylon fabric under a quilt fairly easily. What I really wanted to add was that if you don't squirm around too much at night, the best all-rounder might be a sleeping bag without baffles in the rings of fabric you lie inside, ie. only baffles in the head-toe direction (Western Mountaineering calls it "continuous baffle" design). With those you are free to turn it upside down and shake all or as much of the down as you like to the top part of the bag. So the same bag could be bottomless or have slightly more insulation underneath, depending on what you need. 

I have a 1972ish sunfish I am planning to re-gelcoat the entire bottom of the hull. I made one fiber glass repair where there was a crack through the hull, I took that area down to bare fiberglass before repairing. In another area cracks in the gecoat turned out to be related to a thick layer (3/4 of an inch, 2 cm) of bondo over an old repair. I sanded that area to the fiberglass, unsure if I am going to add more fiberglass, but not replacing the bondo that thickly. Where there are scratches or spider crackes I sanded until they were gone, mostly there is still a layer of gelcoat, in few place there is a little fiberglass showing. For the most part 95% of the hull has a layer of gelcoat sanded with 60 grit. I have purchased two quarts of white exposy gelcoat, one laminating and one waxed for the final coat. Some research I have done suggest the thick gelcoat is part of the reason for spider cracks (when the fiberglass flexes the gelcoat cracks). My plan at the moment is, a coat of laminating gelcoat on bare fiberglass, a second coat of laminating on the entire hull, a third coat of waxed/final gelcoat on the entire hull, sand with 400-600 grit and put the trim back on. All gelcoat will be applied with a brush. Should I sand the entire hull until the gelcoat is mostly gone? If I consider existing gelcoat as one layer, what the is the maximum number of coats that should be applied over any area of the hull?
