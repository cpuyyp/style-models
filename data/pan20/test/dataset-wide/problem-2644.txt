Because they place virtue at the core of their theory of human worth, the Stoic view of human happiness is an extremely active one. Listen to how Seneca puts it in his book On Leisure (1.4): 

That is a question the ancient Stoics asked themselves too, almost word-for-word, in fact (emphasis mine): 

The Stoic call to action and kindness is famously illustrated by the Circles of Hierocles. We are taught to imagine ourselves at the center of a sphere of humanity, pulling everyone closer and closer to us, until we care about their needs the same as our own: 

The truth is that Stoicism was never supposed to be a purely detached way of life. Zeno introduced Stoic ethics explicitly as a middle way between the detached extreme of the Cynics (who withdrew from society) and the worldly extreme of the Cyrenaics (who sought to maximize pleasurable indulgences). Virtue Leads to Action 

Your concern is a common one, and a lot of newcomers to Stoicism report the same issue: they worry that their normal human motivational system is somehow being weakened or damaged by Stoic practice. People often encounter this problem when they focus exclusively on the "calm and de-stressing" elements of the philosophy, as you put it, but miss the Stoic call to value honorable behavior and to tirelessly pursue moral excellence at all costs. But on the other hand, more advanced Stoic practitioners sometimes report the opposite problem: ancient Stoicism's call to benefit others, to be politically engaged, to be a hard worker and an excellent provider for your family, etc., seems to demand so much focus, so much pro-social action, and so much diligent effort on their part that they fear it leads them to an unhealthy and unreasonable amount of "hurried energy to get things done." People encounter this problem when they (rightfully) interpret Stoicism as a radical system of virtue ethics, but leave its therapeutic elements underdeveloped and fail to recognize that self-care is also part of virtue ethics. 1. The Discipline of Action Stoicism is a Middle Way You phrased the question excellently: 

tl;dr: If that's how you experience Stoicism, then you are almost certainly "doing it wrong," as they say. My argument is in three parts: 

Scholars have noted that healthy passions may be phenomenologically very similar to the other passions. The key difference is their cognitive content. They are often still approach-oriented or avoidance-oriented, in modern terms, so they still have a lot of motivational power! As you can guess, the Stoics rejected the passions (1), but they viewed the proto-passions (2) as normal and healthy, and the healthy passions (3) as desirable and essential to the virtuous life. Our main source for these details of the Stoic emotional theory is again Cicero, in his Tusculan Disputations. So yes, you do indeed need to exercise emotional caution in order to make your appointments! But a Stoic would say that this needn't arise from being "stressed," as much as from cultivating a passionate "wish" for virtue: 

There are opinions that are Common Knowledge, Words sold singling out Special seeds people, and The Empath, the Presleep sleep paralysis Astrial projection, Ego Death, Why kill my I? so I can buy their inflated Ego everywhere I go. Ironic Actually. Paper Street Soap Company Inc. You can get more specific with personalities with the MBTI test online, it is popular. Ego is the Selfishness the Empathy lacks and needs to Survive. Emotional Eugenics is my Theory, OK, I started Very straight forward with The Big Five, cite: Carl Jung, Types of personalities Types of Crowd mentality. The Big five personality factors Agreeableness, openess, Extroversion, conscientious, Nuerotic. People have different levels of these. Agreeable, you are likely to be kind, sympathetic, cooperative, warm, Empathic, considerate and perhaps Alturistic. Openness,they may have a transparency to them, what you see is what you get, free, unrestricted access to their knowledge and information, collaborative, cooperative , open to new experiences. Conscientious the Right of Free Will, the wishing to do what is right, especially to do one's work or duty well, throughly. Neurotic, the level of ones natural suffering, not dictated by a organic disease, how one deals with trauma, crisis, trouble, problems. Crowd mentality here is a slope, and it gets slippery even confirmation of a Bias can trigger someone's imprinting instincts. The individual is heavily influenced, loss of self and the impression of a universality of behavior. Which will increase with the size of the crowd. Submergence, individual loss of self and personal responsibility Contagion, the propensity For an individual in a crowd to unquestionably follow the predominant ideals and emotions shared by the crowd. There is a lesser sense of legal culpability in a crowd that's Dangerous in Democracy. It is a all for one and one for all, If your friend split second chooses to 6under someone well, you go to. I would tell my Boys growing up, No one likes to get into trouble alone.

The Barnum Effect Generalize your objectives To suit anyone, everywhere And to make it seem personally specific to the individuallly duel. I believe all these added up, if they were packaged neatly with the correct delivery, it could cause a ideology of one or two to take root and then hold. How did metaphysics get highjacked by out of body experiences, star seeds, stones and woo? The reasons I stated above It was agreeable, it made people feel special and snowflake like, they knew something others did not, They felt a bond with other believers and that bond is as strong as ever if you travel the Internet .

Stoicism actually calls you to an intensely active and productive life: that's what differentiates them from Cynics and Epicureans. The Stoic theory of healthy emotions can help you reclaim some of the motivation you're lacking. If you do have to give up some useful motivational emotions to become a Stoic, then it is because those emotions are morally problematic to begin with. 

You've hit the nail on the head! What psychologists call approach-oriented and avoidance-oriented emotions are a fundamental part of our motivational machinery. Getting rid of them entirely seems like a pretty bad idea! As we've seen, the Stoics do think that our actions are within our power, and that virtuous action is important. Rationally, then, having Stoic beliefs shouldn't lead you to be less active (quite the opposite). But what about emotionally? Emotions help us remember things, they help us focus on what's important, and they give us that extra "tension" (as the Stoics called it) or "push" that helps us perform well. The Stoics agreed! While they are famous for rejecting quote-unquote "emotions," in reality they divided emotions into three categories, and they only rejected one of them. 

Passions: cognitive emotions that involve judging something outside your control to be "good" (or "bad"), in the sense that they are what make your life (not) worth living. Passions are categorized as desire, delight, fear, and distress. Proto-Passions: subconscious emotional reactions and reflexes, that arise directly from your impression of a situation. These include reactions to physical pain, and spontaneously crying at the death of a loved one. Healthy Passions: cognitive emotions that involve judging something within your control to be "good" (or "bad"). These are categorized as wishing, joy, or caution, and include things like gratitude, affection for people, and a desire to help them. 

The goal of Stoic life, then—the only thing that truly has real value—is to live a virtuous life. That life may require shooting for any number of specific goals. In particular, we should strive to excel in our roles as a parent, friend, employee, specialist, leader, etc. Doing so is very important for Happiness, love of hard work is a virtue (specifically, a kind of courage), and one of our highest callings in life is to benefit others, including in material ways. These two things together—the indifference of external things, and the importance of working hard to make a positive social contribution—are a potent mix. 

The Outcome is Neither Good nor Bad, but the Attempt is! It's true, though, that in Stoic theory, it is said that external things are "neither good nor bad." We are taught to value what is within our control, and not to view things like professional success, wealth, or fame as being important to our capital-H Happiness. But the attempt to pursue certain outcomes in absolutely within our control! The Stoics said that external things have a kind of "selective value" (depending on the situation), and that we cannot be virtuous if we do not exert ourselves in pursue of valuable outcomes (namely outcomes that benefit humanity). They were quite serious about this point! In Cicero's De Finibus, we learn that the Stoics thought that people who treated external things as wholly indifferent and rejected even their selective value (namely the Cynics and Aristo of Chios) had destroyed the foundation of virtue. Action matters! Cicero also gives us the famous metaphor of the Stoic Archer: the Archer's goal, he says, is to perform her art well. She shoots at many external targets (which have selective value), but her ultimate goal is simply to do her best. Other Stoics texts make similar analogies to Olympic athletes, pilots of ships, musical performers, and ball players.
