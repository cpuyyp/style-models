The transition will be ugly. I can't see the current system survive. If we take a look at the state of things now, you have to have a job so you can have money so you can have food and shelter. People losing their jobs sometimes leads to homelessness and dying in a street on a cold winter day. That's grim, and hopefully it's rare, but it happens. As robots become more and more capable, they will take more and more jobs. As more people lose their jobs, there will be more and more pressure on the job market. As there is more presure on the job market, wages will get lower. As wages will get lower, people will be less able to afford luxury goods, entertainment, eventually housing and food. As people are less able to consume, companies will start shutting down. The welfare systems will start collapsing. The economy will start crumbling. The system works if it's balanced, that is if people can buy things other people work to produce. If we let it get to this point, then we're in trouble. There will be no point in getting educated if it doesn't lead to a job. Doubly so if it also puts you in debt up to the tip of your hair. The few jobs that are left will require insane levels of qualification because the competition will be so intense. Most people will likely take their chance with no qualification than risking spending years of their life not being productive on the off-chance they get a good job. People will be divided between those with a job (though for how long) and those without. The terminated. The jobless. The unmarketable. On the bright side, there will be no shortage of cool and dramatic names for that part of the population. Yay? What happens when the division gets bad enough? Revolution, rise of the extremes, other bad things. The system will have to be overhauled, or the people will overhaul the faces of those who control the system. If I had to take a wild guess (or write the story), the first century would mark the end of our capitalist society. It would get more or less brutal depending on the country and how despaired people are but heads will definitely roll, figuratively or not. Then, people will build a new society, a new system. Probably something socialist, where the state becomes a welfare state because someone/something has to redistribute the wealth. The situation will eventually stablise, and the new way of life will prevail. Then you can drink piña colada in utopia for the remaining 400 years. Honestly, if robots overtake jobs now, I don't think it will take 5 centuries for the shitstorm to begin and end. 

I think you're looking at the wrong technology. 3D printing is cooler than robots, that's just a fact of nature. Okay, maybe it's not really a fact. There's that though. Villa? Pfft, what about an apartment complex? Or a flippin' bridge? It's fast, it's cheap, it's safe, and at the very worst it beats living in a slum. You want to drive the price of construction down, don't look at robots, look at 3D printing. In the example of the Chinese villa, the price is 400 to 480 USD/m². So for 2000 ft², which is 185.8 m², that's 74.3k to 89.2k USD of construction costs, in 10 days of time. Undoubtedly, you can do much cheaper than that, which is already pretty cheap considering the size. I don't know about 10k for 185.8m², but it would say it's plausible that you could build a small city house for that price in ten years. 

Another option is to keep it only in one solar system, or one planet even. Consider that on Earth there are many biomes, many cultures, and that you can't really explore it all in a lifetime. If you have a big planet, with big natural separations, you can realistically have widely different cultures, maybe even slightly different species, on a same planet. If the story is really about meeting new people, all you really have to do is cross the street. You don't need FTL for that. 

What should we do this nice sunny Florbday afternoon? Sports are a recreational activity for most people. Alternatively, it's a fitness thing. Either way, if people seek a way to entertain themselves and/or stay fit, sports is a valid option. How liked this option will be depends on the kind of technologies available. However, sports don't require a lot of investment. You typically only need a ball and a play area. At the very least, there will be the novelty factor. Maybe this thing you call sport will create enough buzz that it will become an instant hit, with all the kool kidz (with Ks and Zs that's how cool they are) playing the football and such. It may be a temporary fad, or it may be the beginning of a wonderful friendship something. Fun with rules Sports have a lot of rules. Take footie for instance. There's that offside rule that many people struggle with. There's also the penalty kick rule. Most people assume that all fouls in the penalty area result in a penalty kick. However, only fouls that would result in a direct free kick result can result in a penalty kick. Fouls that would result in indirect free kick will still result in indirect free kick no matter where the foul happens. You know, rules. If all you have is magazines, the finer points of rules will be lost in translation. Offside would likely remain because it happens often enough it will get mentioned and shown, maybe even explained. It might be transformed into a more generic "don't camp the goal" rule. The indirect free kick in penalty area rule would likely disappear, because nobody knows that rule even exists today. It should be noted that rules evolve. They appear and disappear, they get modified or amended, though the goal of the game stays the same. For instance, you don't play Olympic games naked anymore, which is kind of a shame but I guess it's the price to pay for not living in Ancient Greece. So when archaeologists reintroduce sports, even if they have the complete antique rulebook doesn't mean the rules will be applied verbatim. Rules really only matter to pro sports though. Recreationally, you usually try your best to play fair and not cheat like a dirtbag. Unless it would be funny not to. Cha-ching At this point, we've pretty much assumed there are pro teams, leagues and competitions. Why? Well, it's a new form of entertainment. As stated before, if there's enough buzz that people start doing the sports, they might also watch it and create a demand for a whole new industry! Cha-ching! Think about it. Teevee distribution rights, seats for live events, sponsoring opportunities, team jerseys and other assorted merchandise! Cha-ching! And then you have gambling and bookmaking. The sport might only exist so people can place bets on it. I mean, realistically, that's the whole point of horse racing. It's not stupider than going to the casino and watch a ball roll around the roulette, so why not. Bets for everybody! Cha-ching! And all of that can be taxed! Cha-ching! Push it to the limit You can make players that are harder, better, faster, stronger. So the rules could accomodate for it. In basketball and footie, you can't typically charge other players. In baseball, throwing the bat at the other team to distract them isn't a legal strategy. Well, what if you could charge players without hurting them, or if they had heads thougher than a wood bat, that could become a valid strategy allowed by the rules. Where do you put the limit though? You may argue that you don't need limits since you can reincarnate players. Big deal. By the looks of it, it's not a guaranteed process. 

You could use tachograph-equivalents that would record speed, position, resting times, etc. These are found on trucks, buses and other large vehicles to make sure drivers respect speed limits and stop to rest. Say, if you ever caught a ship with a falsified tachograph (or lack thereof), they'd be in trouble. However, the tachograph would only serve to prove wrongdoing, not help catch the wrongdoer. So your first bet at catching them would be random controls. Also controls directed at companies known to play with the limits of legality. In other words, standard police work. Second way, assuming there's some of traffic control in and out of planets like there are in naval/air ports, you would know which ships leave planet A and which arrive at planet B. If planets A and B exchange the relevant information, you could know if a ship travelled way over the limit, and maybe if they stopped on route for a suspicious amount of time. If it's a day's travel and it took them two, maybe you can start asking questions. 

Now about how to make suicide happen regardless, keep it simple. You need a room and a pill. Inmate asks to go to the room, eats the pill, then dies. The inmate can back up at any time. You may add a psychiatrist in the loop for good measure, if you have the budget and personnel. This fits the criteria of being a conscious decision, available to all, unable to hurt anyone else. The weak link may be supply, particularly if pharmaceutical/chemical companies estimate it's inhumane. See how some US states reintroduced old death penalty method because they couldn't procure injections. 

The obvious solution would be loading mags mostly with blanks. Something like one live round every 4 blanks for instance. It's common when shooting LMGs to have tracer rounds every few rounds, so the concept isn't so far off. The real question is why would you go to war with blanks? Shooting live rounds when suppressing/covering has the added bonus that you might kill something by happenstance. If your life depends on your ability to transform a human being into Swiss cheese, you wouldn't take a gun full of blanks to combat. 

Carpet bombing, regular bombing, and just, like, lots of bombs You don't need nuclear weapons to cause an absurd amount of damage. You'll obviously need more bombs, but there's nothing that a good carpet bombing can't solve (except of course if your problem isn't about destroying stuff). Bombing is a tried and tested way to level a city. It just works. But it does take some time. It might give some people some time to evacuate underground. Underground is significantly harder to reach with bombs, though if you succeeded in driving all enemies from the surface, that's a definite step in the right direction. They're trapped, they won't be able to do much (unless they are crazy prepared with secret underground bunkers full of weapons and access to super-secret defense system that is bomb-proof, but that's a rather small probability). I'd suggest thermobaric bombs, which are the closest you can get to a WMD without being one. Thermobaric weapons put the emphasis on the heat and shock waves, much like a nuclear weapon really but without the radiation. That will be super effective against all building types. Also, a little technical fact for you, thermobaric weapons are alternatively called "fuel-air", because they consume oxygen. Such a weapon in an enclosed space can do quite some bit of damage by effectively sucking all the air. So even underground, people aren't safe from those. Biological weapons, gas, and other banned weapons Enclosed space is also a good territory for biochemical weapons. If you can seal subway entrances (hint, you can use bombs for that), it's only a matter of pumping enough gas inside and guarding all known exit points. That obviously presumes you have bombed the surface first and people have fled underground. You could instead just poison the water system (and the gas system, why not). However, I personally advise against that. I'm not a fan of biological warfare. You never know when bio weapons will come back to bite you in the gluteus maximum. Gasing people underground is relatively safe, but a virus in the wild is uncontrollable. Especially if the virus is designed for maximum casualty. But hey, it's your war. Random acts of terrorism, electronic warfare and general chaos Some people just want to watch the world burn. Chaos is a powerful weapon. At worst, it can help soften the enemy before you strike which is always useful. If the real world tells us anything, it's that terrorism can successfully divide people. You just need exactly one bad apple to prompt some people to declare a whole ethnicity to be a bunch of terrorists, and I wish that was exaggerating. And you know what they say, divide and conquer. You just have to take it literally. You can also create social tensions and divide people in other ways, but they are less immediate and usually a byproduct of decades of (in hindsight) bad policies. That last one implies access to your enemy's decision-making process, which means at that point there are more effective things you could do (like petition for secession, start a war with someone else, etc.). Electronic warfare is another good approach to creating chaos, and really all you need is to cut the power. A simple blackout is more immediate than a long propaganda warfare, and it has the added advantage of denying your enemy access to electricity. 

Let's be real, in a million years data storage may be done in the form of hairspray for all we know. How many people still have floppy disk drive? And that was only 20 years ago. The new generation doesn't even know what a floppy is, it's just the save icon now. Your best bet would be to back it all up on the current format of choice, then keep transferring from format to format as technology goes on. Don't be shy on redundancies. It will require a lot of space. It will require a lot of effort. It will require a lot of maintenance. But you should be able to preserve your data all the way through. You just have to make sure your physical medium doesn't deteriorate before you save it up on the next generation of CD or what have you. That goes for physical format as well as file format. They probably don't have Word in the future. There's a number of things that can change in the way we treat files in a million years. 

Obligatory: Tropes aren't good. Tropes aren't bad. Tropes are tropes. You always travel at the speed of plot, because that's why the story exists. If you have a good story in mind and you need to use one such trope, then there's no shame in doing so. All you have to do is establish a set of rules and stick to it. As far as we know, there's no way to travel vast distance in a timely fashion. So if you want to do that, you'll have to make a choice. If you want to remain in the harder part of the SF spectrum, I would advise to remain unspecific on how the technology works. If you simply state what it does without explaining the how, nobody can tell which laws you're breaking, so really from a certain point of view you aren't breaking any. Alternatively, you can make up one rule that allows FTL under certain conditions. Once again, you don't have to be specific, just consistent. 

Admittedly, for point 3, acceptable distance to and size of population center may vary. In the show, they mention at least once they have closed the surrounding area due to "chemical leak". I don't remember they ever mention including Colorado Springs in a quarantine zone. To be fair, I've watched the show a lot, I never catch they had a 450k city sitting 15km away. 

It's possible that Taiwan would become recognized again, but the Chinese spot as permanent member would likely either remain empty or be given to another country. Taiwan would have to beat Germany, India, Brazil and Japan who already want a spot. They have more political, military, cultural and diplomatic power, which makes all of them better candidates than Taiwan. To answer the question, the situation after one month would be unresolved. It could take year before the UNSC figures out how to reform. Then it would take even more time to decide what to do with China. A lot of countries would be interest in that territory, if even one of them has veto power (like Russia for instance), it's very possible the situation would never get resolved. Trying to get control by force would be illegal and either fail or start something nobody wants. Nations with claims over the territory would likely do everything they can to preserve the status quo rather than having another nation than them taking control. That could be an interesting scenario for a WWIII though. Anyways, I can see a few ways this ends. Option 1: all the countries with claims find an agreement, said agreement is approved by the UNSC, and China is split in many parts going to all interested parties. Obviously, that will take some time. Option 2: individual people migrate to China and form a new independent country, or several of them. The situation would eventually resolve itself, but that would also take a long time Option 3: no resolution. China permanently becomes an international zone under UN mandate. Since nobody can agree, nobody gets it. Option 4: World War III. Everybody tries to rush in illegally. Since they'll inevitably run into each other, things will escalate. With Russia, India and Pakistan having nuclear power, it could go south very quickly. Option 2+3: A new country is formed under UN administration. People are allowed to immigrate. Once there's enough people to make a country and a government, the UN mandate ends and we have one or several new countries.
