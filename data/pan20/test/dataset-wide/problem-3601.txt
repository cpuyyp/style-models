If I get you right, you can't go to the studio, don't have much time but want to keep as much in form as possible. Also, your equipment is quite sub-optimal. But let's look at the workout first. Workout: To stay in form and keep your strength you need intensity (and consistency) much more than volume. So your lack of time isn't really a concern right now. You would want to do big weigths at low reps, so you're at maximum intensity. You'd probably lose some strength and muscle, especially if losing weight/fat at the same time. But if the overall intensity is still high, you should keep a good level of strength. A simple (and time effective) full body workout I would propose would look like this: 

This should be done 3 times a week, as it's a full-body workout. Modifications: The above program relies on a barbell in its original form, so to use it with dumbbells some alterations will have to be made. I'll go from easiest modification to most severe. Bench and Shoulder Press: The bench press and the shoulder/overhead/military press can be done with dumbbells just as it can be done with a barbell. The side effect you get from using dumbbells, however, is a certain 'wobble' that you'll have to compensate. You will also have to use both arms independently, so you can't compensate for a weak arm with a strong one. Both side-effects may be viewed as beneficial, as the wobble increases coordination, while using two weights prevents muscle imbalances. Those side-effects will also make the lift harder to execute, form will be more likely to suffer and you won't be able to use as much weight. In general, you should be fine if you start slowly and work your way up as long as you use good form through all of your sets, on all of your reps. Squat: The dumbbell squat is a bit more controversial, as the squat variants are very different exercises, depending on where you put the weight. Now you can't reasonably put it on your back when using dumbbells, so you'll have to find another way. I used to do dumbbell squats myself when I didn't have a barbell and found that I could handle them best with the weight on both sides. I just let my arms (with the dumbbells) hang and performed a squat. This worked for up to 88lbs (40kg) for me, before the weights hindered my range of motion. The dangers are leaning forward/backward to much and compensating with the dumbbells. Try to keep them beside you and don't move them back or forth. Deadlift: This is the one lift most people wouldn't do with dumbbells, as I have often been warned. The regular deadlift is a very rigid motion and the aforementioned dumbbell 'wobble' would seriously compromise form. So when I started out, I tried the stiff-legged dumbbell deadlift, which requires a lot less rigidity. I managed to work my way up to 88lbs (40kg) with this deadlift variant, but could probably have lifted even more. Conclusion: That's pretty much all there is to it. With the modifications mentioned above it should be possible to do an all-compound program with dumbbells only. While it isn't the most effective workout ever, it should be enough for a beginner to make considerable gains until a barbell becomes available. I myself did a very similar program for several months and progressed just fine, so it's not a two-week quick fix either, but can work for a long time. 

I actually hate the idea of answering questions with comments as well as questions not having a real answer, so this might be a bit OCD, but here we go: As I pointed out in the comments, you probably did raise your working weight too fast. While different programs use a wide range of progressions, most agree on raising the working weight by a maximum of 10% of what you managed to do the last workout. That doesn't mean you have to raise your weigths super-slowly, though. In fact, as long as you manage your target set and rep count with good form, you can raise you weight each workout. This requires top-notch regeneration, though (calorie surplus, enough sleep, no stress etc.). 

The Front Squat is an amazing exercise that I like to do regularly. It's a bit difficult to do at first, but if you start low enough and work your way up, it's actually not that hard. I started at about 50% of my back squat and worked up to ~75%. As for technique, I'll try to give you some cues I've learned over time, which have helped me a lot. It's still a squat... While you're placing the weight in another position, your back and legs should about do the same thing as with a back squat. 

Basics: Yes, you do have to burn more calories than you eat to lose weight. This doesn't mean you'll have to do sports until you burn up 1200kcal, as your body burns a certain amount every day anyway. The calories burned this way is your basal metabolic rate (BMR). This would be your total energy expenditure for one day if you just lay around doing absolutely nothing. The amount of calories you're actually burning per day is your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), which includes all the walking, getting up, working and sports. Now, to lose weight you want to stay below your TDEE. For this you can eat less, exercise more, or both. Which you do doesn't matter as it's basically calories in vs. calorie out. Nutrition: To answer your question: It is possible to have a deficit of 1200kcal for a month or two, but it's not recommended, as it's not very healthy and/or counter-productive (read up on 'starvation mode'/'metabolic damage'). If you already see progress after a single week, stick to it. In the beginning much of it will be water weight, which is why your progress will probably slow down over time. In general weight loss is a very slow process, but the slower you take it, the more sustainable it is. Granted, there are some amazing 30-60 days transformations, but those are the exception to the rule. For most people, slow weight loss is best, as you're not as likely to yoyo back to eating unhealthy, getting fat again (and repeat the whole cycle). Sports: Your sports program could use some improvement. You'd probably fare better with a dedicated bodyweight exercise program, which focusses on progression to get stronger and add a bit of definition. If you really only want to lose weight, you don't have to do strength training though. If you choose to do only cardio, though, I'd recommend high intensity intervall cardio (HIIT). It's basically a short period of high intensity work with an even shorter period of rest (e.g. 40s work, 20s rest for 12 rounds). This form of cardio won't burn much calories itself but will raise your metabolism for hours after the workout, resulting in more effective fat loss. More muscle mass does burn more calories, though, even when doing absolutely nothing with it. That's why I'd recommend a strength training program anyway. However, to build build muscle with a strength program you'd need a caloric surplus (and eat different, too), which might put you off. In the long run it's a great foundation for losing weight, though. You'll also look much better (lean, instead of starved/skinny fat). 

It's kinda his thing to view any progress at all as sufficient, as in the longterm it adds up. That's a philosophical debate to some degree, but slow and steady does have its merits. Mainly that you won't overtrain and thus not hit a plateau as likely. He says something like that in the article, too. 

I'm doing Starting Strength myself right now and naturally, I did think about how to get rid of the fat I'll gain during the next few months. As @Calvin pointed out in his comment, the workout programm you do is not really important for weight loss. If you want to stay strong while losing fat, though, you should continue lifting heavy. Now, when dieting your recovery is of course not as good, so you might want to start at 80% of your current working sets and cut back on accessory exercises. If recovery is good, you can add weight and/or accessory exercises back in. If your recovery seems to suffer, scale back again. You're cutting now, get rid of the idea of actually progressing on your lifts. A standstill is probably the best one could manage, but don't count on it. You'll notice I'm one of the 'SS-crowd' and I'm quite opposed to changing programms between bulking/cutting cycles. The reason being, if you go for volume because you're cutting you're basically bastardizing your workout to do cardio's job. Speaking of cardio, I wouldn't do it at the expense of weightlifting. Weightlifting itself (especially SS-style) consists of short bursts of high intensity. Sound like HIIT much? If you absolutely have to add cardio, make sure it doesn't interfere with recovery from lifting. Super-Low-Intensity cardio (aka taking a nice long walk) would probably be best. As for nutrition, you should of course cut back on calories. 500kcal under maintenance is normally recommended. Yes, it is slow, but the faster you go, the more muscle you will lose. You should still keep your protein intake high, though, so cut back on carbs mostly, maybe a bit on fat (assuming you were eating right already, to begin with). 

I googled a bit and stumbled upon the following formula. The source claims it's from Journal of Sports Sciences. 

I just googled a bit and stumbled over this article, that tries to scale several exercises to the big 3 lifts. I did some quick calculating in my head and came up with a bench press to skull crusher ratio. Most lifters seem to be able to do ~40% of their bench press weight on skull crushers, e.g. 100kg bench press -> 40kg skull crusher. Since your ratio seems to be much higher, I would recommend to scale back on the skull crushers for a bit, as your bench press seems to lack in comparison. By concentrating on the compound movements like the bench press and the dips, you should be able to increase your strength further. This should have a carryover to your skull crushers, eventually allowing for greater weight. 

That's the two things I'd recommend. If you want to get the maximum out of your workouts you could think about pre- and post-workout formulas, which contain all sorts of fancy chemicals (beta-alanine, caffein etc.). A word on weight gainers: Most of them are glorified Sugar-shakes, and I highly dislike them for that. If you absolutely have to get half of your 4000kcal in liquid form, drink milk instead. 

Of course, there's also some factors you can't change, which also make a difference. Some people just happen to have the weirdest amount of clearly visible veins on their arms, while other haven't. So genetics clearly are involved. 

Dieting Speed: You lost about 0.5kg (1lb) per week, which is generally recommended for slower diets. The benefits of dieting slowly are that there's virtually no muscle loss (you really only lose fat) and better carryover of good habits to the time after the diet. Also, it's easier to stay sane and keep going, as you're probably not starving throughout the day. So seeing how you're not really that much overweight I wouldn't recommend losing weight any faster, as that's when detrimental effects set in. You'd begin to lose muscle along with fat, performance drops, comes to a standstill or at least progresses slower. Also, a faster diet is not as sustainable and won't have that much carryover of good habits for after the diet, as faster diets don't work with good habits normally (think 'starving'). Protein Consumption: You say you're not eating much protein, which could become a problem. Protein is very important to build and maintain muscle mass. No matter if you want to get better at your workouts or just not get worse while losing more weight, you will need sufficient protein. Opinions on what is 'sufficient' differ greatly and depend on what kind of activity you're doing, so it's a bit hard to say right now. If your were weightlifting, I'd recommend 2g/kg (1g/lb) per day. If you're 'only' doing cardio you might get away with less. Regarding protein supplements: Seeing how you seem to have problems getting enough protein in, this could be worth a try. Generally, you should be able to get everything you need from whole foods, though. Should you for some reason not be able to meet your protein goals, a supplement can help. Keep in mind that it still has calories, however (~120kcal for 30g whey), which you'd have to compensate by either eating less or working out more.
