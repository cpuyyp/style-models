I have noticed after tennis matches, the athletes will wear coats even though they are sweating profusely. After heavy workout, I notice I need to wear heavy sweater, even though it is 90 degrees outside. Is this a good practice? What is the medical reason for this? 

I understand that one set of Surya Namaskar is a set of identical exercises, working the left and right sides of the body. So I guess someone can count one set of Surya Namaskar as two rounds, i.e. 

I wish to start Couch to 5k soon. Due to logistics, family, etc, I am confined to exercise in my apartment (at least till it warms up again) How to do couch to 5k standing in one place. I know how to jog in place, but how to walk and run in place? There must be a way. Couch to 5K 

Please advise starter indoor exercises that don't require extra $$$ In Springtime (May 2017) I hope to run outdoors. Honestly, I wish to run simple marathons, to expand circle of friends and enjoy myself ----- all while maintaining health. I would rather run New Years Eve marathon than sit home and stuff my face while waiting for Ball to Drop. 

Well, part of the answer depends on how/why you've got GERD. If yours is like mine [A], you need to do things that do not compress the abdomen (road biking [B] and sit-ups) as well as keep ones' head raised above one's body (so no hanging upside down). None of the nearby gyms [C] have pools, so I can't test swimming. Notes: A - I shouldn't eat chocolate, alcohol or fatty foods, as those irritate the situation. B - With the ram's horns handlbars. Ones where I sit upright (such as hybrid, mountain or commuter bikes are fine). C - In the chain I'm a member of. 

I recommend stoicism. One light read on the subject is Stoic Warriors: The Ancient Philosophy behind the Military Mind. 

Layering clothing is a smart idea if you live in cooler climates, or where the weather may change suddenly [A]. 

Yes, walking will help lose weight. As you get older, you may find yourself able to run less and less (before the onset of knee pain), so continuing walking will be helpful as exercise. I find that the difference between daily 30-45 min of walking (I have a desk job) and 0min walking is about 5-7 pounds (or maybe you'd rather prefer this explained as "if I walk 30-45 minutes per day, after about 2-3 months, my baseline weight is about 5-7 pounds lighter than when I have no time to walk at all"). When I was carless, I had to walk about 90-120 minutes daily as part of my commuting and was about 20 pounds lighter than when I later got a car and was able to drive everywhere. Your experience will probably be different. 

Please recommend more dynamic stretches that improve hip mobility. That will open up the hips. Also recommend other dynamic exercise for running, esp for couch to 5K. 

I wish to circumambulate around Mount Kailash on foot. This is roughly 33 miles of mountaineous terrain. Many people do this for spiritual reasons, i.e circumambulate once to wash away your sins, circumambulate 108 times to attain nirvana. I just want to circumambulate around Mount Kailash because I want to. What type of training do I require? I understand this can take years, even decades. Some information about me. 

I tried Burpees and for past few days can manage to do Level 3 burpees, 2 sets of 3 reps I wish to work myself up to Level 5 burpees, i.e. including push-up and jump-up. How many Level 3 Burpees should I comfortably do before I attempt Level 5 burpees. Or should I attempt Level 5 burpees right away, even if it's only one or two per day. And how many Level 5 burpees should I do per day to give strength and endurance for successfully competing in Spartan Race or in general? Thanks. 

You are a programmer like I am; that means that your most important feature is your brain. "Oversleeping" is not a problem. Overweight is a problem. Insufficient sleep is a problem. Sleeping is very important for keeping your brain working properly. Without your brain, you have no job. That 10-15 hour sleep on the weekends is your body's way of recovering what you've cheated it out of during the week. Sure, I'd love several extra hours per day, who wouldn't? You and I have the exact same 24 hours per day that every other human has. There is no other way around the fact that we're both meat bags and the bag of meat requires maintenance. Yes, we can be a lot more productive with 25+ hours per day, but reality doesn't allow that. My body prefers 9 hours of sleep per night: my lifestyle requires that I get 6 hours of sleep per night. Both things cannot be true - something has to give. For me, the weekends are for recovering what I can't get during the week. As you age, you will realize that your body is more important than your desired lifestyle. Get the sleep your body wants. 

Help, I am really confused. Do they mean make 54 sets, i.e. 108 repetitions, or 108 sets? I am thinking they mean 54 sets (i.e. one set around the Sun), but now I'm not too sure. 

Question: With the above plan can I still run marathon in a few years and maintain healthy joints? I don't mind if it takes longer to run in marathon, I'd like to know if above plan is feasible. Thank you 

I've always had knee problem did lot of knee strengthening as a kid/ adult Did hours on stationary bike on and off throughout teen and early adult years. Not athletic. Only in past year I was able to build up to 108 Surya Namaskars, plus do little stationary bike and lifting 10, 15 lbs at home. Currently dealing with hip tightness (posted separate thread) Lady, will turn 37 in few days, 146lbs, 5'4", excess belly fat 

When to begin Couch to 5K Program. I can do 108 Surya Namaskar in one sitting (takes an hour). And I can stationary bike 15 minutes at a time. However, I have left tight hip for past 2+ weeks. I feel the discomfort when performing donkey kicks I was told to perform dynamic stretching for relief. Should I wait till hips are better, or can I gradually start couch to 5K now? Is there other stretches/exercises I can do to prepare for couch to 5K? Thank you. 

I find that compression shorts help me reduce chafing when biking. The spandex in the typical ones tend to wick away moisture to keep things dry enough to minimize chafing. I've been obese enough that just ordinary walking would abrade the hairs off my inner thighs. 

In my opinion, it is a throwback to the fashion from the movie Rocky. Although I like Christopher's idea of heat conditioning [B]. Notes: A - I live in Denver, CO. We can get some very severe weather changes. Also, with the altitude and humidity here, it is possible to get 50°F (28°C) temperature swings during the day. B - Summer highs (here) are frequently over 100°F (38°C) for extended periods. During heat waves, the night time lows are rarely 20°F (11°C) cooler. 

I don't like short socks. My ex was a dancer and she hated long socks (she'd wear ankle length ones). Most of my socks don't quite go halfway up my shins, but I have some that make it to my knees, and those are hiking socks (and are for a small amount of padding in case things go up one's pants, or you're banging into things with your legs). For sports like footy/soccer/rugby, the length of socks is more like part of the uniform of the sport, like basketball shorts are for basketball.
