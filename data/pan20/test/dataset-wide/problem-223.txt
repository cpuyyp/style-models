Now pick-up the longest path. Hold it up so that the two safety pins on each end are level. Shake out the mesh then take the lowest hanging loop and pick it up and hold it up so the pins on both ends are level with the pins from the first loop. Repeat this operation until you have the minimum number of strings left. Unhook the strings you are holding above the line from the mesh. This was a bit tricky keeping them all untangled. You should now be left with a single line of safety pins linking each town. 

We can use one of the many asteroid impact simulators around to estimate the damage for single impactors. I've used the one from Imperial Collage London We can enter different values here for the size of the incoming asteroids. As an example I picked a 500m object with a density of 10000 kg/m3 (higher than iron as you said they are heavier elements) impacting at 11.00 km/s (slow) at 45 Degrees to the ground (the average impact angle) and had it hit crystalline rock. The full result can be seen here: $URL$ The headline is a final crater diameter of 9.27 km from an impact energy of 3.93 x 10^19 Joules. 9.40 x 10^3MegaTons I would suggest playing with the numbers and seeing what kind of effects you get. It gives you different things at different distances from the target so have a play around with that setting. Multiple impacts will be required to deliver the amount of material you are suggesting unfortunately I couldn't find any thing on the dissipation rates of dust from the atmosphere which would be the limiting factor between impact events if you don't want to kill every one. Have fun with Armageddon 

Martial arts is a much broader subject than simple unarmed combat between humans. If we limit ourselves to Japan alone, there were indeed many unarmed martial arts such as jujutsu, but there were also numerous schools involved with armed combat, including kenjutsu (katana), naginatajutsu (naginata), Sōjutsu (spear), Kyūjutsu (bow), and to mention a more exotic art, Kusarijutsu (chain-weapons such as kusarigama or manrikigusari). It isn't generally recognised today, but Europe also had their own schools of martial arts, including schools teaching the use of the broadsword and shield, halberd, rapier and many more, but with the rise of firearms as a weapon of war, they have been largely forgotten, much more so than the Asian martial arts. I won't even start with the many mainland Asian martial arts. You may notice in the list of Japanese martial arts, I have mentioned mainly those ending in -jutsu, these being the schools of martial arts taught to warriors, unlike the -do martial arts, which are frequently watered-down versions of the -jutsus taught to civilians. When you're dealing with monsters, you don't want a martial art which is nerfed for public consumption, where the emphasis is on preferably-non-lethal self-defense, no, you want an all-up the-best-defence-is-a-good-offense martial art optimised to kill. Given all these martial arts, those involving weapons would be of greatest use against monsters which are for the most part relying on their natural weapons. The advantage of being able to keep a greater distance between yourself and a slavering beast while still being able to counterattack cannot be overstated. It would also be the case that both weapons and the martial arts devised to employ them will be optimised according to the monsters that the art's practitioners will be facing most often, as well as to dealing with humans. While humans will unite against a common foe, don't underestimate our propensity to squabble amongst ourselves either. Another factor is that weapons will frequently be adapted from tools that their wielders would be using regularly. While swords have the advantage that they are light, easily carried and deadly, they are also expensive. When faced with a marauding monster or a human enemy, a farmer would be more likely to grab for a farming tool such as a sickle, rake or hoe, a woodcutter would rely on his axe, a builder might use a mallet, and so on. Of course, in Japanese mythology, oni are frequently depicted as being armed, and there is no reason why the OP's monsters may not also be smart enough to make or scavenge weapons. In such a case, it would be the height of foolishness to attempt to deal with such a monster unarmed, and the height of sensibility to use something like Kyūjutsu which maximises the separation between man and monster. You can then escalate matters - monsters using martial arts, with arrow-cutting (the use of a weapon to deflect arrows), thus either forcing combat back to melee range, or requiring multiple archers to deal with the monster. The sheer variety of martial arts which humans have devised should be enough that someone will have the skills needed to defeat even a martial-arts-trained monster. 

Yes but... The problem would likely be the cost of shipping. Raw oil is very unlikely to be found on Mars to make the plastic with, so your down to synthetic and high energy processes to manufacture them locally, or shipping them in. It would likely be more helpful to a colony to have actual plants around, this would have the added bonus of filtering air as well. Though they would require water. These plants could be shipped to Mars as seeds to cut down on the weight requirement. Locally generated compost could be used for soil and presumably the colony will have some source of water or they are going to have trouble lasting very long. From the physiological point of view plants have been shown to have a therapeutic effect on astronauts. Don Pettit famously kept the blog of the astro zucchini while he was in orbit ( $URL$ ) I can see this idea helping, however there would have to be a significant advantage over say some clever 3D effect screens acting as windows to make it worth the extra cost. As they say in space travel every gram is expensive. 

Yes, this is just as possible as a jet dragon, though rather more limited in range due to the need to store both oxidiser and fuel. The most efficient form of rocket engine would be a liquid-fuelled type. Then, as this is a biological rocket, the oxidiser and fuel would best be HCNO-derived chemicals, those being the most readily available to carbon-based organisms. Fuel: Given the requirement for HCNO-derived chemicals for both oxidiser and fuel, and that we must presuppose that these fuels are not externally obtained and must be synthesised by the organism. Of the many fuels and oxidisers, Hydrogen peroxide and Monomethylhydrazine are probably the most likely combination, as both are liquid at body temperature and standard air pressure, making them easy to store, and both can be biosynthesised. I don't believe this combination is hypergolic, but providing an ignition source such as an electric arc would be feasible. Storing these fuels would be a minor issue, since they are ordinarily toxic, but it has been shown that animals are capable of storing toxic substances safely. Reaction Chamber and Exhaust: The reaction chamber must be strong and temperature resistant. There exists the possibility that our rocket dragon could be able to precipitate metals or graphite sheets that would allow a strong, temperature-resistant combustion chamber and nozzle to be formed. The reactants could be passed through the walls of the combustion chamber prior to mixing to both pre-heat them and cool the chamber walls, preventing excessive heating of the creature's body. Provision of other insulation would reduce further heat transfer, as would strategic positioning of the organ so that it would not dump its waste heat directly into the creature's core body. The combustion chamber might best be located at the end of a short, strong tail. The concept of a combustion chamber like an extra anus and co-located with said orifice would lead to heat management issues in much shorter order. Evolution Since the reactants involved can be and are biosynthesised in various organisms, and have benefits other than propellants (such as protective toxicity in the case of MMH), they could occur. Then, if, like a bombardier beetle, this organism evolves a defensive heat source on its rear end, it is not too much of a stretch to progress to using that to assist flight by adding extra reactants. This system would have the added advantage that it would not only provide a means of rapid escape from one or more predators, but would also be highly likely to injure or kill at least one predator if triggered at close range. As to size, the most efficient, manoeuvrable flyers are small, so these rocket dragons would most likely be in the 6-foot range specified in the question, and quite lightly built, save for a large propellant-storing belly. However, larger fliers have less parasitic drag, and induced drag decreases with speed, so a larger size is not out of the question, especially as rocket assisted take-off is a given. The duration of the rocket burn would be dependent on the power of the thrust. It may be possible to maintain sufficient thrust to maintain altitude for some minutes, or to expend the available reactants in a few seconds to provide a rapid getaway or increase in altitude. The main issue would be the synthesis of the reactants. It would take significant energy input and time to synthesise the reactants, so the reactants for the minimum six-second full-power burst might take days and a very high energy input to synthesise. This would preclude any herbivorous lifestyle. However, having a rocket would make for a predator that could not be outrun, only outmanoeuvred. 

The downsides to this method: It takes quite a while to set up. You need to steal a map. It is very easy to end up with the mesh in a complete knot. I am not convinced it will always give you the correct answer. (But it seems close) 

The problem would be that they would be well inside the Roche limit. And would need to be well inside the Roche limit for a very long time for the tidal locking to occur. Tidal locking actually takes a very very long time to happen. The process it is thought to happen through is explained quite well in this wikipedia entry. That's with out taking into account the atmospheric drag of the second planet being inside the atmosphere of the first causing it to slow its orbit and then smash together reasonably quickly. To pull this off you would need some form of magic involved. As another small side, though the moon's orbital period and rotation are tidally locked we don't always see exactly the same chunk of it. It moves slightly and we get to see about 9% 1 more surface area than we would if it was completely locked to us. Unless the two planets were exactly locked together you would not be able to build a building across the gap as it would crack if there was even the smallest movement. 

In such a situation of dire global emergency, it is entirely likely that governments would switch to a command-economy mode, meaning that if the vendors of the goods necessary to save the world did not voluntarily reduce their profit margins, then governments would take steps to make it a legal necessity for the vendors to supply the goods at cost. In the event that the vendors attempted to decline to supply the goods entirely, the vendors' businesses could be seized and nationalised, and if necessary any persons with necessary trade secrets could be... compelled by whatever means necessary to divulge those secrets for the good of the entire world. 

Black holes are called "black" only because light does not escape from beyond the event horizon. However, they are typically not what we would call either black or invisible. A black hole was typically once a star, and so is highly likely to still have orbiting bodies - it may have lost some mass in its supernova explosion, but not so much that it would have lost all of its satellites, though it is probable that their orbits would have been significantly altered. Also, black holes appear to emit EM radiation as matter falling in toward them is torn apart by the gravitational tidal forces. Some black holes have very bright accretion disks. Finally, the powerful gravitic field of a black hole would cause gravitiational lensing, that could be used to detect it, given that this effect will distort the image of the rest of the universe as the black hole passes between the observer and the rest of the universe. 

The trouble here would be dealing with more complex components. There are two main types of electrical components. Active and Passive components. Passive components tend to be simpler, your resisters, capacitors, transformers and so forth. These it should be possible for our engineer to work out given his multi-meter and some basic knowledge. Does it measure as having any resistance? (Resistor) Does it allow an AC current to pass? (Capacitor) Is it made of a lump of ferrous metal wrapped in two sets of wires? (Transformer) Though our engineer will probably still destroy quite a few components working this out. Active components on the other hand are an entirely different kettle of fish. Most active components look like a blob of plastic with some metal sticking out and some markings to tell what they are. Think every thing from the classic transistor to the CPU inside your computer. Almost every engineer when faced with a component he doesn't know will stick the code printed on it into Google to find the datasheet. Our poor engineer doesn't have this option. (Language being the big barrier here) Many many human components are encased in very similar packages, this makes standardisation of machines to produce things easier so I would expect the aliens have probably done some thing similar. 

As @congusbongus says, it isn't an "insect", true, but it is a lifeform with an exoskeleton rather than an endoskeleton. You won't get any strength above that of an exoskeletal lifeform of equivalent size and biology, save for the usual tradeoffs between speed and strength that you get by adjusting the muscle-skeletal lever ratios - muscles have a maximum contraction speed, and a maximum force output and by adjusting the lever ratios, you can emphasise some combination of speed and strength. 

Epidemiological studies have shown that to successfully combat the typically-described zombie outbreak, it is necessary to eliminate zombies and the infected humans rapidly, otherwise the end result will be a world where zombies have replaced humanity. In medieval times, human life was somewhat less valued, and in the initial stages of an outbreak, people would be more likely to avoid someone obviously sick than to try and help - and get bitten, thus reducing the bite rate. The zombie removal rate could be considered to be a little higher too, especially as the outbreak continued, as it could be made a religious duty to kill the zombified and infected. Additionally, the full plate armour that knights wore would make them far more resistant to being bitten and infected, thus reducing the bite rate against said individuals, who would also be better at zombie removal. All in all, without actually simulating the outbreak as the authors of the paper I cited did, I can guess that there is a fairly even chance that either the zombies or humans will win, probably depending on the speed with which the authorities act to control the outbreak. In either case, there is quite likely to be a lot of corpses, and if the humans win, the clean-up isn't likely to be pretty. The epidemiological study shows that cities are dangerous places to be, that it's far safer to remain out in the countryside. That is the case in modern times, and will be just as valid in medieval times. 

Joining the ranks of the EMP crowd I'd go with Explosively pumped Flux compression bombs. These work by generating and compressing a magnetic field using a power supply, a coil and some explosives. See the the wikipedia entry for a full description and description of how they work. The magic trick with most of these emp type weapons is the power supply but given we are talking 200 years into the future it is not unreasonable to assume that power storage (batteries) have got a lot better. Look how far we have come in the last 100 years and extrapolate forward. An explosively pumped flux generator is actually quite simple to build given a power supply and explosives. However it is single shot, quite small, and usable like a Molotov. The hardest bit to get hold of is probably the explosives to blow the coil. These would be used in a riot to disable the police vehicles and any electronic equipment on them. Cameras, Radios, movement assist devices. This might even completely immobilise them depending on how their armour works. 

Unfortunately, if there is any combination of relatively harmless chemicals that become toxic when mixed in-vivo, then they are either undocumented or classified. The challenge in a multi-part toxin is in finding precursor compounds that are either non- or minimally- toxic in themselves, and yet are capable of reacting in-vivo to produce a highly toxic compound, without first being altered by the body's metabolism to the point where the desired reaction to produce the highly toxic substance cannot take place. This is challenging enough, but to add the complication that the precursor compounds must be something that a human would unknowingly ingest reduces the possibilities even further, since many of the potential precursor chemicals could have an unpleasant or at least obvious taste and/or smell. There are rumours that a viable binary poison is being developed, but these are unsubstantiated. However, a potential avenue for producing a binary toxin would be to create a toxic compound composed of two proteins that are individually harmless, yet can combine in-vivo to produce a toxic compound. Botulinum toxin is such a two-part toxin. If the two proteins that combine to produce this toxin were produced separately, and then administered separately, the potential exists for them to combine in-vivo and then produce their toxic effects. However, the two proteins involved would have to be administered separately in quantities much greater than that required for the compounded toxin in order to have the same toxic effect. Additionally, the proteins involved would be denatured by cooking, thus requiring that they be protected from high temperatures prior to administering them to the victim. Finally, it is unknown if these two proteins would survive for as great an amount of time in-vivo when separate (since they would both be exposing surfaces of the folded protein not normally exposed due to their bonding to one-another in normal usage) as when administered in combination, whether an immune reaction may become possible when administered separately, or if the two proteins will actually combine in-vivo to produce their toxic form. Thus, while it may be simple to say, "Administer the two botulinum toxin proteins separately", there are many potential complications that may render this approach ineffective. However, the potential exists that modified versions of these proteins or other bacterial binary toxin proteins might prove harmless when administered alone, but combine in-vivo to produce toxic effects.
