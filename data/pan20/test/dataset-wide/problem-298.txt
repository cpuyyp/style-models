Pay your guards very well, so much so that significant bribes are insufficient to make them risk a long and valuable income stream as their regular job. Make the guards a corps, rather than just employment. Care for your guards - feed them, arm/equip them well with current arms and armour. Care for their families - any guard injured or killed and their spouse is covered for life, and children till age of maturity. 

All this engenders a loyalty amongst the guards who will then put in th extra effort. Compare this with mall renta-cops who don't really care once they clock-out. 

Another take - ohana meaning family. "The concept emphasises that families are bound together and members must cooperate and remember one another." In relation to this pantheon of gods, is exactly like Uncle Bob and Aunty Moaner. At a family gathering you may be annoyed by constant hugs from one, but you still have to tolerate it because the other is your favourite. 

One specific idea - separate breathing from eating. As humans we have to stop breathing for a moment to drink or swallow. Evolutionarily-speaking, its probably to make the best use of a complex system of the mouth for speaking as well as chewing rather than duplicating things. If the beings had separate eating orifaces from their breathing ones, then efficiency rises and multitasking becomes more possible. Downside, the human nose depends on air movement to smell things, and having no air movement there would impact on the sense of taste. On the positive side, there's zero danger of choking on food, or inhaling vomit into the lungs because of the partitioning of systems. 

Rather than trimming years off education, bring the school into work. That is, incorporate "labouring" time in education and call it physical education. Include helping your "elders and betters" in the underlying social expectations, and instill this in the child from an early and formative age. Consider teaching some skills later, for example teach "survival maths" instead of higher maths like calculus, which is left to late-high school, which is after the earliest leaving age. And start schooling earlier in life - kids can do some hours at a kindergarten or pre-school from 2 years, and work up towards a 6 hour school day by the age of 5, and an 8 hour day by the age of 10. If you're short on labour, use the older kids to look after the younger kids. This also teaches skills to raise more labour over time. This is playing the long game though, so assumes Glorious Leader is forever. You don't want a bunch of illiterate former students in your labour force, so make schooling a lifetime process. Instantiate Night School classes or Adult Education (either optional or compulsory) to continue educating your labourers. Also foster a culture of knowledge sharing, like reading over television. Finally, consider a "high school leaving exam" where student must perform a series of day to day adult things to graduate Some ideas for school-leaving exam - once student can perform 85% of this or better, they may leave school and join the workforce, and get a social status boost, and a pay increase: 

Now like good munchkins i'm sure you're all thinking of ways this can be exploited, however this system can't generate much in the way of new information. For instance if you try to get it to produce "a really good movie" or a video of a new mathematical proof it doesn't work unless you know the information already or you go through the details. Generally the AI can't create information that your own mind couldn't create in say a dream, the major difference is that the ai creates information so good it is totally indistinguishable from an actual video. 

Let's start by assuming a superhuman that isn't limited by biology for obvious reasons. Then let's assume they also receive super toughness to make this work. Their super toughness scales with strength, so that if they are 10x stronger than a human a normal blow will only harm them 1/10 as much as it would harm a normal person. This is more of a tentative rule, if this is inadequate to avoid really anticlimactic solutions then I will totally change it. I'm also assuming other stuff like how many G's they can withstand before blacking out scale the same way. Now the obvious thing I need to know, is if they have something analogous to muscles generating force within their body, how do you calculate how fast they can run and jump? Obviously things don't just scale linearly, a man who can carry a few tons as much probably can't run supersonic, so clearly speed isn't linearly derived from strength. For the purposes of this I will not be considering crazily high end superhero's, nor superhero's barely above human level. I am asking about the consequences of superhuman strength ranging from a lifting a ton, to carrying 10 tons. (metric or imperial your pick). I am working on a setting that involves superhumans, and I want to be able to figure out what combat would actually look like, how fast they should actually be able to move and how high they could jump. By starting with their strength and working to figure out how other abilities are derived from that. I am also assuming that where it matters the super's reflexes are sped up, and their perception of time is slowed down when they are moving fast, so that they can use the resulting pseudo-super speed effectively in combat. The things I want an answer to cover are: Given a particular amount of super strength, from a minimum of lifting a ton to being able to lift 10 tons at maximum, how high will they be able to jump and how fast can they run and otherwise move? How would their movements apply to other movement situations, like moving inside buildings, for instance would you be able to run leaping from wall to wall. Also more generally, how does super strength influence movement capabilities? I can find dozens of sources talking about how super strong punches would work, but next to nothing covering basic extrapolations for movement. For instance, how much of a limiting factor is the strength of surrounding materials to super strength enhanced movement, how much does it limit your ability to jump or run at full strength? How plausible is it for someone with super strength to jump over buildings, or to get to the top of a skyscraper by wall jumping between it and another adjacent skyscraper? How does the ability to rapidly accelerate and decelerate influence melee other than just being able to hit harder? Suffice to say, I think mid tier super strength is probably way more versatile and just different than generally imagined. To be extra clear the only power that matters here is the super strength, (though it also comes with super toughness and somewhat faster reflexes as required secondary powers.) Everything else should just be be about the logical extensions of super strength, specifically how it affects movement. Bonus question: Given the massive force to mass ratio of these superhumans, they could certainly manage human powered flight through any number of means. Elaborate on a method you think would be particularly good. 

Candles Jim could use fat from a kill, heat it with stones from the fire till it runs, and pour it into a hollowed out bone "end" or raw mud pottery cup. Even a shell of an orange or a hollowed out root vegetable or tree nut shell would do. Suspend a wick in the liquid, perhaps a few strands of cotton cloth from his clothes, and once the fat has cooled and solidified then its a candle. Maybe keeping the source of the wicks secret is his way of stopping others from duplicating his candles. Further info $URL$ 

All the other answers deal with physics and thermodynamics and ignore the root of all evil - Money. There may be an issue of ownership - Halley would surely have a word to say about reuse of his comet, were he still alive. Since he's not alive, ownership will pass to his descendants, who have to be located and queried. Given that Edmond Halley was English there will be a reasonably-sized Compulsory Purchase payment due to Halley's estate Refer to $URL$ In short - complex finances could kill this faster than the consensus that it won't help anyway. 

Answer: the Oxygen molecule O3, known as Ozone. I live in New Zealand and between us and the Australians we have a high level of UV compared to other places in the world. I get sunburned through my clothes, and I can get sunburned on a cloudy day. Some of this is because of the Ozone hole over the antarctic, allowing more ulta-violet in sunlight to come though. So your planet could have a naturally higher level of ozone, or could be actively adding ozone to the atmosphere somehow. Perhaps there are a lot of shorelines, because Ozone is generated by wave action. Or a heap of electrical activity, again oxygen is converted to ozone in proximity of electrical discharges. Ozone is damaged by chloroflorocarbons, aka CFCs, that were used in spray cans for years, as well as refrigerents like Freon and fire suppressent like Halon. Your planet should never have any of this. Links: 

For this question I'm assuming a utterly infeasible technological breakthrough suddenly makes wormholes technology possible. However there is a major catch, the 2D "windows" as they're called don't allow through matter or gravitational pull. The "windows" can be opened for about a half a million USD. Once opened these portals stay open indefinitely unless closed. Opening a portal requires a large amount of energy, and the use of expensive and bulky machines on one end of the wormhole, with only a small machine and energy on par with a car battery required on the other end. The portals are flat windows that look like portals, however were you to walk up to one you would pass through it unaffected. The portals size can be as small as a millimeter or as large as 2,600 meters, any larger would require using multiple portal machines and linking them together. A portal can have any shape with the smallest definition being a millimeter, however portals are totally flat. Each side of the flat portal corresponds to a side of the other end of the portal. Each of the two connected portals must be the exact same shape and size. Portals will continue moving as the machine that created them was, at the moment it created the portal, other than controlling its initial motion you can't move portals except as detailed below. This means if the machine was orbiting the earth the portal will continue this motion, even though it isn't itself a object and has no mass. Portals also continue accelerating or decelerating as the machine was when it created it, however while portals can continue accelerating indefinitely they will slow acceleration such that they approach, but never reach the speed of light. A portal on earth will not slowly drift, since slight changes in planetary motion such as the lengthening of days is effectively counted as deceleration thus the portal undergoes the same slowing, this only holds true for motions that continue at the same rate of acceleration/deceleration as when the portal was created. The end of the portal which requires the expensive machinery to create can be kept linked to the machines so that it moves with them, however this means you can't use those machines to make further portals. Weapon note: To prevent the scenario of potential apocalyptic destruction, due to someone launching a portal through the sun. I have decided that a wormhole will collapse if more than about the equivalent of a kiloton of TNT worth of energy tries to pass through it in a second, though most energy that can pass through it in a second is equivalent to a ton of tnt. Since the portal only allows through at most a ton of tnt, any additional energy is reflected back when it hits the portal. This is still a lot of energy so it still has a lot of weapon potential. Keep in mind, as far as I know all energy would be in the form of photons. TLDR: It's a portal that only lets light through.Well actually other details of it are more complicated, so read the whole question before answering. What uses would be implemented for such a technology assuming it essentially appeared in our world overnight? The most obvious thing I can think of using it for is as a source of near infinite energy, you could get one end of the portal in an orbit much closer to the sun and use the energy to boil massive amounts of water (also may be useful for desalinization). Using it to allow faster than light communication is an obvious application as well (though given our current technology that's not super useful). 

Thousands-Of-Years-Old Blood Without reading the other answers (for time's sake) I'd say that you could feasibly preserve just about anything in an airtight container or room -even a body- for hundreds or thousands of years. Were it just the DNA that you needed. it's possible that this may be intact after massive amounts of time, even dried and in dust form. But I think that's going to be a percentage chance and lower and lower with time and environmental variables. Were you going with the airtight container, being able to remove oxygen from the equation would help. A vacuum sealed vial, say, better yet, AND/OR...in a cold cavern beneath this desert, sealed off from the light and air by a collapse? Perhaps your hero, anti-hero, or whatever "Fred" is can be led to this location by a note or map, or even a tracking-device with an audio recording or hand-written message, if ancient or lost technology is an option. And if this technology is available, then many things are possible, especially if this is from an advanced race, or a time-line far advanced from our own. The cave scenario works, I think, because scientists have recovered dna from just blood-stains over a hundred years old. There was a show just last year that matched DNA from a scarf obtained over a hundred years ago during the Jack-The_Ripper investigations in London at one of the crime scenes, and they were able to match it to some people. That shows that, despite the worst, uncared-for conditions, not all of the DNA had degraded. There were enough of the cells left to identify people. But in caves, on mountain-sides, in air-tight tombs, frozen in ice, bodies have been discovered -fully-preserved. (in the frozen case, sometimes as viable as if they'd just died, with far less cell degradation than scientists had even dreamed. I.E. The Wooly-Mammoths, over five thousand year old "Otzi-The-Iceman" found frozen in The Alps, The 500 year old perfectly preserved Incan maiden, found in a buried mountain chamber. She was so well preserved, she looked to have just died. Her arms and hands look alive. they have her on display. there are other examples of mummies found buried in the desert, in caverns, in bogs, in ice, etc. But I digress a wee bit, because you asked about blood specifically. I mentioned all of this because it shows the possibility for preservation beyond what was once thought possible. Scientists have stated the life of dna at something like 500 years, but around a million or so, given the right circumstances. Do your research to get the right number on that as I'm only close. Even so, viable DNA has been obtained from prehistoric samples much older than a million years. DNA does break down over time, however, -due to bacteria and other variables, which is where your technology, -and maybe just the right addition of circumstance and location- comes in. I.E. cold,subterranean, air-tight chamber, air-tight vial of blood, some technology... perhaps just something added to the blood to stop progress of and/or kill any bacteria and preserve it in its liquid form. That would probably be the most simple option. Or even the body itself could have some gelled blood, possibly mostly useless, but smelling enough in the dark chambers that haven't been exposed to air in thousands of years to lead your "Fred" to the body and the vial, or other container. hell, you could even have the S.O.B. have chopped off a digit of his pinky finger and placed it in a capsule-like device with some kind of circulating apparatus on it to keep blood flowing nearly indefinitely with some kind of added futuristic chemical that keeps the blood fresh. The purpose of this would be to use the digit to clone him when he was found, but maybe that technology is lost, or maybe that was what you had in mind. Maybe his memories are stored in a chip on it, or they're stored in the blood if your "Fred" is a vampire or something like that. Anywho, hope I have been of help. This has been a fun few minutes away from what I was doing. I reserve no rights to anything I've typed, obviously. (except obviously reposting the whole thing as an article or something somewhere and claiming it as your own, because that's just lame.) Be inspired, copy and paste parts, or ignore it, but hopefully you found it useful. P.S. As an after thought. In that last scenario, with some kind of technology to preserve part of himself or a sample of blood, there really is no need for any kind of temperature control or protective environment, as long as the device is safe. The corpse could be bones nearly turned to dust, half buried in the desert sands, in the shade of some large rocks or something, as long as the device was safe, or tough enough to survive the time and weather and anything that may have come along. The trick is how he smells it. 

Ok so I would like to make this answer to point out that in such a system the rich would always be to effectively buy votes at the base rate instead of at the exponential rate. You brought up that if you pay people to vote you can't be certain they'll vote how you want. The problem here is that this would be a very small issue for the rich. You only need to find a bunch of people who you are certain will vote in your favor such as religious evangelicals if republican, then just buy votes by giving them money. Even if there are laws against it it would be impossible to stop. You could hide your vote buying by only giving a few votes and spreading it over a larger group. Or better you could just give them donations that aren't for voting per-say but they would likely be motivated to spend it on votes, and if they don't then they don't get more money next election. As for whether the rich people in both parties would cancel each other out: Well even if they did it would still be exclusively about who spent the most money, but in addition one party would probably have a slight monetary advantage, since money is the only thing that matters in this election once one party got ahead they could leverage that to stay ahead forever becoming a one party system. In response to your edit: 

Well as a given people will still have cryptography. To avoid punishment messages will be hidden using code words and the like, within larger messages that would appear to be about something else. Even if law enforcement had strong suspicion that a message contained a secret message, proving it would be difficult, and maintaining plausible deniability would be easy. Cryptography would have to be done such that it isn't definitely apparent as cryptography. This still isn't that significant, unless the legal system suddenly lowers the standards for a shadow of a doubt quite a lot, proving something is coded when it is intended to not appear to be would be nigh impossible. Cryptography would be pretty similar it would just be slightly inconvenienced. EDIT: What I mentioned is technically stenography not cryptography, anyway stenography will become widespread partially replacing cryptography. 

Magic or at least sleight of hand. Danger here is it might get him rejected, not accepted, if its perceived badly. 

Physical Actions - perhaps Jim can juggle? Bowling or catch or dodgeball or knucklebones - nothing that requires keeping score more than "one at a time" or "taking turns" Music/Rhythm - noone knows what kind of song or music early man had. But there's a high chance birds were singing back then and early humans might have emulated them for pleasure. They might appreciate a rendition of "Yellow Submarine", without understanding it at all. A sling might be feasible - needs some cord and a cup, and a bunch of smooth pebbles. He may not have the ability to sling it himself, but a tribe of people who live by their hands could see the benefit. 

We're all adults here... so what age group is your story targetted at? Jim might be boring at home, but if missionaries haven't been invented then that's new and exotic. Also there's a size differential as suggested by @Korthalion which may be proportional. Even just same-but-different a way of freshening the blood leading to genetic variety over the subsequent generations. Many cultures recognise the dangers of inbreeding in isolated groups and could value Jim just for that. 

Point of this is that a smart 8-10 year old might be able to leave school, but an 18 year old might not be able to perform the same tasks. What happens when school kids can't achieve by a certain maximum age we leave to your imagination. 

In "Red/Green/Blue Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson, $URL$ the martian colonists offer services so a form of barter. But one of the services is to increase the local oxygen level of the atmosphere by some (small) amount. This is seen as a promise to do a community service, and might be perceived as a kind of "local sales tax" paid to the planet. This would be open to abuse, in the form of All Take, No Give. So your currency comes from having a visible or measurable level of honour or truthfulness which is reflected in the flavour / colour / spin / taste of their mana / aura / magic. So I give you a week's bread, you promise to spend 2 hours gardening and cleaning up the local kid's playground because you know my kids play there. You do it, everything is good. If you don't, you "smell" bad and I can sense that, and won't trust your promise next time.
