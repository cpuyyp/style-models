With these words and the syntax, this sutra seems now making more sense to me. However, I'm still stuck that why this sutra will lead to the issue about "controllability". Maybe it is here (my translation from the Chinese version of this sutra): 

These are part of the lines of Buddhist Hymn (偈) given by Great Huineng, to summerize what he taught Chih-Tao. The purpose of Hymns is to let students easily memorize, thus it's always concise, poetic and rhythmic in nature, for at that time people used to learn by heart instead of using CPU for data and search engine! It goes as: 

About Illusion Why a sad novel will make you cry? Even though what you are in contact with merely paper and ink (if you are reading a book). Why you see the wave coming and going, even though the water particles are merely moving up and down, not forth and back; (number of persons holding hands get them up and down will create the same "wave" illusion). Illusion can have real effect, if the mind believes in it. We are seeing many illusions, e.g. our vision is not perfect constructed partly by illusion/imagination, we have blind spot in our vision scientist said that the brain "filled in" the blank, read this in the medical magazine. You assumed but didn't directly ask if past future present are illusions Yes, time is illusion, so is space. Past and Future definitely can't exist independently on their own, it depends on the Present - when the mind recalled or projected them; the Present doesn't exist as well (!!). I credit Rinpoche Khenpo Tsultrim (慈誠羅珠堪布), he explaint that how a smallest unit of time can never be found, therefore the moment of Present can never be established. What is the smallest unit of time the Present? A second, but it can be divided into half a second, a half second can further be divided half... so on and so forth - infinite. However, if a unit of time can be infinitely divided, then that moment can never be passed thus the next moment can never be born. Infinitely dividable is a mathematically dividable but it is not for our phenomenal world's time. We are tricked by the mind and logic. In our phenomenal world we experience the previous moment and the next moment continuum. However as it can continuously be dividing the smallest unit of the present moment, the present moment cannot be established. If the present moment cannot be established then all the phenomenal world "matters" cannot be established. But we do experience the phenomenal world - Ultimate Truth is beyond the dialect logic and also the Indian Classical four-truth logic. So, Albert E., no matter how high his IQ scored, can't work on this bit of anomaly :D. So does a yogi or meditator there able to tell you what's going on with him (provided he is authentic and genuine). 

Xuanzang's (玄奘 602–664CE) Karika on the Eight Consciousness has this piece: 去後來先作主翁. Means, the Alaya the last leaving the dying body and the first entering the concoction when life conceived. However, in other Sutras, the Buddha did stress that he hesitated to teach about this higher teaching for those unfitted would mistakenly grasping it as the Self, he only taught it to the qualified. Thus, Alaya shouldn't be simply equated as a "person", in this sense. Nagarjuna clearly analyzed in his Madhyamaka, that saying there is Self or there isn't Self both are wrong. There is huge misunderstanding about "mind stream" in convention Buddhist scholastic discussion; related to the Anatman/Anatta notion. Thus it inevitably caused awkward and unnecessary argument about if there is rebirth or not. This is mainly due to the incomplete understanding by referring to the incomplete teachings. If, those scholars or conventional Buddhists have the access to the Mahayana Canon, especially the Chinese, they shouldn't have this doubt. The mind stream never ceases, whether live or dead. Yet the mind stream also never is a stream, like a stream filled fully with water. It's more like the blinking light-bulbs on the X'mas tree, because they are blinking so fast, it gives you an illusion the lights trailing from end to end, like a stream of light. This is my metaphor why it appeared there a person. One is able to understand properly if one read and got the meaning from the higher teachings preserved in Mahayana Sutras. 

No. I think in the "adi-buddha" related faculty no record showed what he taught. If you are interested in Buddhism, read some fundamental sutras such as the Heart Sutra. Buddhism is about how to end the suffering and be truly liberated from life. It's not about supernatural, mystic, magic, spell, voodoo power that sorts of things. 

From the tradition and my way of learning the Buddha's Dharma, I've not heard this practicing Buddhism isn't about having a good time saying. l heard more the emphasizing on Impermanence (無常), not Dukkha as often read in this forum; we suffer from or making mistakes because of Ignorance (無明); practicing The Four Immeasurable Hearts (四無量心/慈。悲。喜。捨) are antidote to miseries and help cultivating a prosperous life. Good. But I read the inspiring teacher Huai-Chin Nan once talked about The greasy old Buddhist, that may echo with the OP's teacher. The greasy old Buddhist is full of jargons learnt from the scriptures, without intrinsic understanding or actual practiced achievements of the teaching holding onto certain doctrines then started to teach, criticize anything or anyone that's not/according to those doctrines, he conversed simple meaning by assigning Buddhist terms everywhere. It's really unhealthy for the mind! The other is about meditation, though reaching Samadhi accompanied it the bliss, but this bliss shouldn't be a goal for pursuit, nor for craving neither induging, [it could be dangerous for higher level of practitioner - Mara's target, Surangama Sutra]; many practitioners mistaken comfort of sitting as Samadhi, far from it! The immediate effect for adopting Buddha's teaching some may get cured of illnesses (sometimes even the medical diagnosis announced terminal diseases), this most often could be achieved by correct practicing of Dhyana, there are many methods in the Mahayana Sutras. However, the actual practice of Dhyana involved transformations, bodily and other faculties, these could involve a tough and testing time, very rarely I've almost never seen it's discussed in this forum. Understanding life is dictated by Impermanence, we accept change if it's inevitable and then letting go. Unfortunately, there is no such place as the Christian Heaven to escape to! The elaborating preaching of Nibbana may serve as a goal for those longing for Heaven under the inscription N instead of H, but Nirvana/Nibbana should never be a goal, it is coming as a sign of fruition but not as an object to pursuit. Rather, the highest ideal is 當下。自在。(here and now, unconditioned free from any limitation). Yet it's easy to say, testing to practice. In good time, yes; what in bad time when life raining dogs and shits?! We learnt that Ignorance is the root cause of all the sufferings therefore cultivating wisdom free us from making mistakes; The Buddha's Dharma is the highest form of wisdom. I heard the CEO of the Taiwanese tech firm the supplier of Apple's lens LARGAN he devotes time studied only the Lotus Sutra and practicing meditation, in his busy schedule. The even higher ideal is 心能轉物，即同如來。(the citta turns [transforming] things, that one the same as the Tathagata). Someone sufferred from physical ailment may not be able to turn his head, let alone turning/ transforming things. The other pitfall is false renunciation, teacher Nan cited the traditional idiom: in front of the gate of hell are full of Bhikkhus and Taoists (地獄門前僧道多). A prisoner renouncing freedom, a penniless man donating all his money; these are ludicrous renunciations. Someone still a prisoner of greed acquiring bit of knowledge of Buddhism started to trade the Dharma/Dhamma is a very bad fruit. True renunciation is when someone is all perfected in life then renounced, like Prince Siddhartha. The Sutra said that all Buddhas are constantly in the Samadhi of the Four Immeasurables. Again, even practicing this well-known Dharma sincerely is a challenge, lip-practice doesn't count! As a personal experience, adopting Buddha's Dharma is an independent event. Instead I once got interested in Christianity and studied quite a lot of The Bible. The Sutra said it was rare and auspicious incident when one gets affiliated with the Buddha, it can only happen when the Root of Good (善根) matured in eons of life-times. Hence, over enthusiastic of promoting Buddha's teaching may need to be cautioned. The one unique distinction of Buddhism is that it never did such as Holy War or Crusade. Affiliating with politic or seeking popularity does more harm than seeing the Dharma disappearing in the Age of Decline.
