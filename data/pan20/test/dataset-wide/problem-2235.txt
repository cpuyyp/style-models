Now, you'll notice from the image I posted that the buzzer flags look like ordinary assistant flags. In your question, you ask why the 5th and 6th officials have these wands. What you'll actually find is that all of the officials are adopting these pager and communication systems. The 5th and 6th officals' wands look more like simply flag-handles. This is because there is nothing in the laws of the games catering for flag signals by these two goal-line assistants - therefore they don't have the yellow and red flag fabric on them. The assistant referees will accompany their paging by the mandated flag signal as well. Sources

First of all, I'm not aware of any set of rules that governs exactly what to do in this regard for every possible expansion or team-move situation. With any change that potentially alters the structure of the league, it's likely that the owners would put forth proposals on new conference or division alignment or playoff structure and they would vote for changes as needed. They already do this at times, for example, for last season they changed the way seeding is awarded for playoffs, essentially making divisions pointless except for scheduling. Not too much is ever set in stone for years into the future. From the 1980-81 season through the 2003-04 season, before the addition of the New Orleans Hornets, there was an odd number of teams in the league, so it's not unheard of to have unbalanced conferences, although not with a difference of two as you ask about. Starting in the 2001-02 season, the Memphis Grizzlies began play as the easternmost team in the West Conference as they moved from Vancouver. There are many teams in the East that are west of Memphis, but the league elected to keep them in the same conference so as to avoid making multiple changes across the league--they kept the status quo even though it didn't make the most sense geographically. Basically, any new scenario could be handled on a case by case basis. The owners would probably be resistant to complex realignments just because one team moves (as in the case of Memphis), but they do have the flexibility to do so after any particular season. For example, if for some reason the 76er's moved to Seattle, they would surely be placed in the Western Conference but my hunch is that the owners would want balanced conferences and send a Western team over to the East. In fact, I'm pretty sure of it since there would be a material difference in odds of making the playoffs between the conferences, and that wouldn't fly with the owners in the larger conference. 

I'll try to elaborate on the scoring criteria that you posted. Judges are encouraged to score rounds 10-9 in favour of the boxer who landed the most clean punches in the round. Because of this, the judges should be counting the punches that land and taking note as to the number of these punches which are hard and clean. However, this isn't the only criterion that judges can apply in their scoring of the round. They also look at the quality of the vaguely-termed "ring generalship". Ring generalship is what you noted as "control, technique or style". Now there's little to zero guidance as to how the judges should assess this and it is therefore left wide-open to the interpretation of the individual judges. Some judges will award the round to the "busier" boxer - that is the fighter who threw the most punches whether they were clean or not. For this reason, you'll will often see a boxer finish the round with a flurry of punches so as to impress upon the judges that they had a higher workrate. Some judges look for aggressiveness. This can go against the defensive, counter-punching boxer when they come up against a walk-forward, inside boxer. On the flip-side, some judges like a fighter with a good defence and will award the round to the boxer with the tight defence and good evasive manouvers. Other factors affecting the scoring As you note, if a fighter completely dominates a round then the judges can score a round at 10-8. A judge will deduct one point for each knockdown. For example, a judge will likely score a round in which one boxer is knocked down twice as a 10-7 round. The knocked-down boxer losing one point for each knockdown and one for being totally dominated. One point can be deducted as a penalty. The referee will indicate to the three judges when a point is to be deducted. This can be done in the event of a low blow or other infringement including not following the referee's instruction. Governance Professional boxing judges are rarely held accountable for their scores. Only in seriously controversial outcomes will you see the relative boxing association call a review. In amateur boxing, such as in the Olympics, all of the punching is computer-recorded and a judge will be called to answer if his assessment widely differs from that of the computer. There is no rulebook for boxing judges. Quite simply they can score the fight how they like. 

The NHL regular season overtime format has undergone quite a few changes over the years. The first season with sudden death overtimes was 1983-84. The whole purpose of including them was that people simply didn't like so many games ending in ties. Along with changes to the way points are given to teams in the standings, there have been experiments with adding shootouts and with reducing the number of players on the ice in overtime (so that it's now 3-on-3). In doing this, the NHL has ended up eliminating ties, added a little extra excitement/drama to the end of games, and to a certain extent quickened the games up. Other than maybe tradition, the reason that postseason games have a different format is that the regular season format is (for lack of a better word) gimmicky--just trying to get a quick, exciting result for the game. In the playoffs, more weight is given to letting teams play at full strength with all their players in a normal setting. In other words, they continue to play the way hockey was intended to be played and the way that exhibits that one is really the better all-around team. Also, an extended playoff game, perhaps reaching two or more overtimes, can be pretty gripping to viewers because the stakes are high and at any moment everything could be determined--but we really have no idea when. Compare that to a regular season game that has a lot less importance; if it had the playoff overtime format an average observer might just stop caring at some point--it starts to drag on, and the experience wouldn't be as unique. 

A lot is said in football about the referee's "interpretation" of the rules in a match. In the interpretation of this law, we should look closely at the term "immediately". You will very rarely see a referee award a free kick against a player who passes or shoots with an un-booted foot. The player is at a disadvantage by being missing a boot so the generally-seen interpretation is that the player has had his shoe removed by accident. With regards to the immediacy of the event, you're not likely to see a player running around for 15 minutes without a boot so pretty much any time from the loss of the boot up to the next time there is a break in the play could be deemed (interpreted) as immediate. To sum up the interpretation as simply as possible; if the player has lost a boot and he hasn't had chance to replace it, then he will not have a foul awarded against him. Earlier this year, Alessandro Matri scored for Juventus wearing no boot on his right foot. 

This is a common practice among all teams besides the Orioles. The ball is thrown to the first baseman so that he can then keep the ball in his glove and use it for the infield warm-up when the team goes back on defense. The practicality behind doing it as the first baseman comes off the field is so that he doesn't have to rummage about the dugout looking for a ball or forget to go back out with one--especially if he is hitting during that inning. A batboy, coach, backup player, or whoever (varies by team) gets it to them right away while they still have their glove on and that's the end of it. I'd say that it wouldn't be a huge deal if this wasn't done or was done differently, so it's safe to say that tradition and sticking to a routine have some role in the practice, too. 

The wands that we are seeing more commonly in football are known informally as "Buzzer Flags" or, more correctly, "Referee Paging Systems". 

For those who don't know, with the majors, and a lot of other golf tournaments on the PGA and European tours, the first-two rounds have groups of three players and the groups tee off at 11 minute intervals. In the 3rd and 4th rounds players play in pairs and at 10 minute intervals. This can change subject to weather conditions, reduced daylight times, etc. Now, these tee-times are extremely tightly regimented. For example, at the British Open, Ivor Robson can penalise a player 2 strokes if they are 2 minutes late and disqualify them if they are 5 minutes late. That's certainly an incentive to be on time. I'm not exactly sure as to when 11 minutes was set as the de facto for tee-time intervals, but it is one that the golf associations deem the optimum time to get every player out on the course. Also, with an average round of golf taking a little over 4 hours, the tee-times are arranged so that, once the last groups have started, the 1st tee starters and the 10th tee starters should be nicely "in sync" on the whole course. However, to prevent bottlenecks the following is done: 

There is no distinction made between overhand, underhand, or sidearm passes and they all follow the same rules.. 

I'm interested as to why you think the stretch is more advanced than the wind-up. It seems to me like the wind-up includes much of the stretch mechanics (roughly speaking) but with a lot of extra movements involved. The fact that these kids don't have to actually worry about base runners should actually simplify things in learning the stretch delivery. From one article on Ballfrog advocating for teaching the stretch to young players, 

You're right to point out that these awards come from different organizations and that each may have different rules, but if you're looking for a general rule of thumb: to win an award for either the National or American league, a player should play the majority of the games for that season in that league. Even meeting the criteria of having played a majority of games won't make it easy though. "No player switching leagues has ever won an MVP award and only one, Rick Sutcliffe of the 1984 Cubs, has won a Cy Young. Sutcliffe went 16-1 in 20 starts after the Cubs acquired him from Cleveland". For the MVP award, the number of games played is actually the number 2 criteria given to voters (I'm assuming that means number of games played in the given league). There are specific qualifications to be eligible for the Golden Glove awards, for example 

At the first corner there is a greater probability of a crash happening as all the drivers are looking for opportunities to overtake. For this reason the course car and also medical chase cars, which you see immediately behind the grid, are positioned at the back of the grid for the race start. 

It is my understanding that the term has military origins. A red zone in military terms is the danger zone, generally close to the enemy (red having been a symbol for danger for a long time). The term is analogous to sport as the last 20/22 is where you are more likely to suffer the danger of conceding to the opponent. I see that Merriam Webster has the first usage in sport at 1983 but the military/danger use predates that somewhat. Indeed, there is the 1966 film, "Red Zone Cuba", which is centered around a military facility. During World War I, the decimated areas of France were known as the Red Zone. To sum up my answer, the term "Red Zone" has been used in various contexts as a term for danger. Its application in sport is to represent the danger of your enemy and it was first coined by ex-Redskins coach Joe Gibbs in 1982.
