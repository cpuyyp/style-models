No. One should not attempt to validate raw in situ measurements with reanalysis data. Reanalysis data contain partial information from observations, but are mostly model fields and are provided at very coarse resolution (~1$^\circ$ longitude). In situ measurements are subject to very local, small scale effects, and have different meaning from reanalysis. One is always free to compare the two datasets, but this would not be validation in any meaningful way.

The answer to this question depends on what process one is interested in simulating well. As you know, short/mid-range weather prediction models and climate models have very different applications and goals. Because the short range weather prediction model is typically of much higher resolution than climate models (~1-10 km versus ~50-200 km), it is almost always more skilled at simulating clouds forming at a specific location and time. Cloud and rain prediction skill tends to be greater in synoptic scale fronts and near topographic features, and smaller for sporadic, small-scale, tropical thunderstorms. In very high-resolution NWP models (2-3 km or smaller), convection and clouds may be simulated reasonably well without using any cloud parameterization scheme. Nevertheless, clouds and rainfall are still hard to simulate or forecast very accurately. On the other hand, due to very low grid resolution, climate models can really aim only for correctly simulating the occurrence frequency and the amount of clouds and rain in a larger geographical region over a longer period of time. In climate, clouds play a significant role in radiative feedbacks. Climate models still rely on cloud parameterization schemes. 

Yes, if one takes the common meaning of the term "eye of the storm" to be the area of relatively low wind speed near the center of the vortex, most tornadoes can be said to have eyes. Cyclostrophic balance describes a steady-state, inviscid flow with neglected Coriolis force: $$ \dfrac{v^2}{r} = -\dfrac{1}{\rho}\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial n} $$ where centripetal force balances radial pressure gradient. Here, $v$ is tangential wind speed, $r$ distance from vortex center, $\rho$ is air density, $p$ is atmospheric pressure and $n$ is the radial direction pointing inward. From here, tangential wind speed is simply: $$ v = \sqrt{-\dfrac{r}{\rho}\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial n}} $$ suggesting that $v\to0$ when $r\to0$. While the flow in tornadoes is highly non-stationary and subject to friction, this idealized model shows why there must exist an "eye" inside a vortex or an area of closed circulation. This "eye" may or may not be easily recognized by a hypothetical human observer inside a tornado. 

In fact, a similar (but far more involved) technique is already commonly applied: the triaxial IRM and thermal demagnetization protocol of Lowrie (1990), which involves applying decreasing IRMs along three orthogonal axes. In Lowrie's technique, however, there is no mention of calculating the SIRM as the sum of the orthogonal components. Is anyone already using this technique? Are there any obvious pitfalls I've missed? I am tempted to try it the next time I need to determine an S-ratio, after a pilot study to confirm that the SIRMs are additive in the way I assume. 

Once your stone is picked up and taken into your house, it's no longer part of the regolith material, although the surface you took it from was itself eroded by the stone's removal. In the literature, human influences aren't usually excluded when discussing ‘erosion’. For example, the term is often applied when discussing how footpaths are worn down by human use (see e.g. Coleman, 1981). So, if your dropped stone chipped a bit out of your floor, you might try to claim that as erosion, but only if you're prepared to argue that your floor constitutes regolith! If you want a geologically appropriate term for what happened to your stone, abrasion would probably cover it. Allaby (2008) has this definition: 

The use of ‘erosive’ in the definition perhaps doesn't make it entirely clear that this can apply to the particles as well as the surface itself, but it's easy to check that ‘abrasion’ is indeed used in this way in the literature. For example, again from Nichols (2009): 

As you can see (and as Laclare et al. point out), solar semi-diameter has shown no significant variation during the measurement periods. Given their deviation from the other data sets, the Wittmann data seem rather suspect, but even they show absolutely no change between the 1972 and 1981 data points. In short, none of these data are consistent with the notion that solar diameter changed in 1979. 

I suspect that this diagram has nothing to do with polar vortices in the meteorological sense. It’s hard to prove a negative, but digging into the source of this image led me in some very non-meteorological directions. The file itself is entitled ‘Growth measure and vortices’ on Wikimedia (note absence of ‘polar’), with a source of ‘own work’ (by the user ‘Snowy Weather’) and the description ‘Projective geometry block in a Waldorf high school’. Apart from the ‘Projective geometry’ page, the only Wikipedia page using this image is the one on Waldorf education, where it’s described as ‘Student work from a projective geometry block in a Waldorf high school’. The image was added to both the projective geometry article and the Waldorf article by the same user (not the original uploader of the image), who doesn't seem to have any background in meteorology. This makes me suspect that the ‘polar’ may have been added in error. On the ‘Projective geometry’ page, the image is described as being ‘based on the work of Lawrence Edwards’. Almost certainly, this must refer to Edwards’ book Projective Geometry, which seems from the reviews to be rather esoteric: 

Yes, wave variance or energy spectrum, direcional or non-directional is positive-definite as @aretxabaleta said in the comment. In linear water-wave theory, the surface elevation is described as a linear superposition of sinusoids: $$ \eta(t) = \sum_{i-1}^{N}a_i \sin(f_i t + \phi_i) $$ where $a_i$, $f_i$ and $\phi_i$ are the amplitude, frequency and phase, respectively, of each wave component $i$. The most commonly used wave spectrum is the wave variance spectrum. Wave variance is: $$ \langle\eta^2\rangle = \dfrac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}a_i^2 = \sigma^2 $$ and wave variance spectrum $F(f)$ is defined such that: $$ F(f)\Delta{f}=\dfrac{a_i^2}{2} $$ In the limit of $N \rightarrow \infty$ (continuous spectrum), the following holds: $$ \int_{0}^{\infty}F(f)df = \sigma^2 $$ Being quadratic, both wave variance (spectrum integral) and individual discrete spectrum components are positive-definite. Note that so far we implied non-directional frequency spectrum, i.e. spectrum defined in frequency space. It can be also defined in wavenumber $k$ space, and the following holds: $$ \int_{0}^{\infty}F(k)dk = \int_{0}^{\infty}F(f)df = \sigma^2 $$ $$ F(k)\Delta{k} = F(f)\Delta{f} $$ $$ F(k) = F(f)c_g $$ where $c_g$ is group velocity of an individual component. The non-directional spectrum is simply an integral of directional spectrum over all directions: $$ \int_{0}^{\infty}F(k)dk = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}F(k,\theta)dkd\theta $$ Be careful about units here. All spectrum integrals must come up at $m^2$. Thus, $F(k)$ has units of $m^3$ and $F(k,\theta)$ has units of $m^3$ $rad^{-1}$. If you are considering polar (spectral bins scaling with $k\theta$ instead of $\theta$) directional wavenumber spectrum such that: $$ \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}F(k,\theta)k\ dk\ d\theta = \sigma^2 $$ then $F(k,\theta)$ has units of $m^4$ $rad^{-1}$. 

The only open and ongoing data source for in-situ ocean wave measurements I am aware of is the National Data Buoy Center. Though NDBC manages data service from plenty of moored buoys in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, unfortunately there isn't much in your region of interest. The only buoys I have found that are somewhat near the Southeast Asian region are 2 buoys on the east and west side of Guam, and one right by Northern Mariana Islands: 

I own the Second edition, 2005 reissue of this textbook, purchased through Amazon in August 2009. After p308, my copy has only one more page of content (p309), which is the last page of the Index. You indeed have a faulty copy. I recommend you send it back for replacement again and request them to inspect the copy before shipping. If you are still unlucky with the second replacement, I would try e-mailing the publisher with your purchase invoice and request a pdf of the book which would complement your hardcopy with the missing page.

It's definitely not a meteorite Perhaps the easiest way to rule out a meteorite is to note the vesicles in your first picture. These alone make it almost certain that this isn’t a meteorite: meteorites overall are rare finds, and vesicular meteorites are very rare even among meteorites (around 0.1%). You mention that your specimen is highly magnetic, and this makes it entirely certain that it’s not a meteorite, because no meteorite is both vesicular and magnetic. It's probably slag As Dr Randy Korotev at Washington University in St. Louis says: ‘vesicles and metal together in the same "rock" are a good field mark for slag’. Slag would also be consistent with the flat face (from solidifying on a flat surface) and the ‘molten’ texture on the other sides. As requested, here’s a photo of some similar slag for comparison: 

But more to the point: even if there is slightly increased heat flux here, why do you think it would affect the CO2 readings? What mechanism are you suggesting by which a small amount of conducted heat, several kilometres below sea level, is able to perturb atmospheric CO2 concentrations several kilometres above sea level? Finally: even if there were such a mechanism, the mantle plume operates, as you point out, ‘all the year’ – year in, year out, for millenia before the Mauna Loa station even existed. So at worst it would produce a constant offset, and wouldn't affect the trend of the measured CO2 concentrations. 

The combination Putting the two parts back into the contexts where you found them: the first article mentions an increase in the diversity or marine mammals, and the second in the diversity of dry-adapted shrubs. Both these increases occurred between the start of the Oligocene and the end of the Miocene. 

Unilaterally deployed SIA targeted at a particular region could have negative side-effects. This is the topic most relevant to your question. As the references show, there were indeed plans for this, at least in the sense that it had been discussed in the literature for some years. I don't know of any state drawing up concrete plans for SIA stations yet, but it's probably a good idea to raise these concerns before the policy train gets rolling. SIA might be deployed at a single site as a globally targeted SG technique, with the assumption (as seen in [9]) that it doesn't matter where you do it because the aerosols will spread evenly over the globe in any case. Jones et al. show that this will not necessarily happen.
