It's not quite correct to think that deriving a contradiction implies all propositions. What deriving a contradiction does is prove a modal realm to have arbitrary truth values. It says that, in order for your argument to be valid, you have to live in an alternate, crazy, universe, where anything is possible. If an argument leads you to ~A==A, it doesn't break the world. It breaks your argument. The solution is to fix your argument. This is the whole point of Paraconsistent Logic: to force people to abandon flawed arguments. There are a great many questions in philosophy that are considered important, but which rely on apparent contradictions: "Do I exist?", "Can god create a stone heavier than he can lift", "This sentence is not provable". It's an interesting feature of human linguistic ability that we can create seemingly meaningful sentences like those. HOWEVER, to then spend hundreds (thousands) of years arguing about them is viewed as counterproductive by many philosophers. We could afford to sit by the fire and sip sherry and indulge ourselves back when philosophy included all science. Now? Not so much. 

It's always subjective, I'm afraid. When you speak of things that are "objectively true" you're talking about 2+2=4 and A==A, and not about anything which it is possible to have an opinion about. Many people would argue that objectivity is impossible for subjective creatures like humans (though phenomenologists would argue the exact opposite: that everyone's subjectivity is objectively valid. How this differs from "everyone's viewpoint is subjective" is an exercise I'll leave to the reader). 

I know there has always been some debate concerning whether or not a certain logical system (like classical logic) is the correct one, especially when it comes to propositional claims about the external world we inhabit. The Philpapers survey from 2009 shows a clear majority (51.6% classical : 33.1% other : 15.4% non-classical) in favor of classical logic (I'll assume the question refers to which logic they believe to be correct when it comes to reasoning, but there are really several different interpretations of that particular question, which may have influenced the results). I would also consider myself a proponent of classical logic as the correct logic when it comes to evaluating the world as it is (though not necessarily how it relates to reasoning, especially when it comes to the inconsistent beliefs many individuals hold). I would say that my philosophical worldview (there is a mind-independent external reality that operates on some deep, fundamental principles) heavily influences this, as I don't believe in any inherent fuzziness that might be amenable to a multi or many-valued logic, and I certainly don't believe in true contradictions (whatever the hell that would even mean). With that being said, what are the best avenues one could take if they wanted to show that classical logic (or another logic, as Alan Ross Anderson was a platonist with respect to relevant logic) was "better" than all the others when applied to uncovering the nature of reality? In addition, has any progress been made when it comes to the program of Universal Logic, which would uncover the foundations or similarities between every logical system conceivable? Any input on this is greatly appreciated. 

This is a question of liberty, not philosophical freedom. Philosophical freedom (free will) is the ability to make choices, rather than having your choices made for you by an omnipotent force. Liberty is still a worthy topic of discussion, however, since it has a lot of tasty ethical problems wound up in it. This discussion is too broad to deal with in any meaningful way, but I'll give you a word: Utilitarianism. Governments are pretty much all Utilitarian entities. They are allowed to exist because they make sure that the majority of people are allowed to live lives of acceptable utility. If they fail in that duty, they tend to get overthrown. This can be via an election, in a democratic society, or a revolution in an autocratic society. Doesn't really matter. The take away here, is that the government governs at the sufferance of the plurality of the people. That same plurality is the one that takes away your rights, imposes the privileges, duties, and laws of your society. The existentialists would point out (rightly) that those rules are falsely internalized by most people, and given the status of natural law ("Thou shalt pay thine taxes"), but the simple fact remains: if you choose not to be so bound, society will quickly bind your ass, one way, or the other. 

This is, at its root, a question of set theory. The statement "X does not exist" can be easily translated to, "X is not a member of the set of things with the property of existence." Existence is the same: "X is a member of the set of things with the property existence." Very simple, right? So where does the problem come from? The problem comes from the fact that we haven't enumerated the set of things that have the property of existence. If we had, it would be trivial to prove non-existence. Most people feel that the set of things that exist can never be enumerated, as the universe is big enough to make this effectively impossible. Therefore it is effectively impossible to prove non-existence. 

My query was based on something read years ago and, the vagaries of memory being what they are, I am likely guilty of having conflated something someone said about Sartre as opposed to remembering something articulated by Sartre himself. Given that, it's probably not a surprise that no one has found a smoking gun, an article where Sartre describes his life's typology. Moreover and to Sand1's excellent point, my use of the words complete overhaul of the foundations of his thought from the group up almost certainly overstated the case. As the Playboy interviewer (linked by Gordon) lurches from question to question, there is a suggestive moment where Sartre says, "'Original choice' is the term I use to describe what happens at the moment — a protracted moment, covering a certain span of time — in which one makes something of oneself, of that self which so far has been made by others. We start by being made by others, and then we remake ourselves, starting out from what others have made of us. But at the moment when we remake ourselves, a dialectic comes into play: We find ourselves very different from what we expected and what others expected of us.” Extrapolating from that comment, from the interesting comments and answers posted to this thread, the excellent links to both the Playboy and NYRB interviews as well as a wiki article ($URL$ one can glean a proto-typology which form reasonably unambiguous periods in his life, thought and work...experiences and moments in his life which were transformative and in all likelihood resulted in such a remake. But is that 2, 3, 4 or more periods? Fabricating a very rough chronology then, there are Sartre's earliest, self-described aspirations to be a novelist and professor of literature. In the 20s he read Henri Bergman, met Raymond Aron, attended lectures by the neo-Hegelian Alexandre Kojeve, etc. -- all of which were drivers of his evolution into becoming a phenomenologist philosopher. At the end of that decade he met Simone de Beauvoir, his intellectual equal, a woman who became his lover as well as a profound influence on his life. Throughout the 30s he taught at various lycees and published several books. These pre-WWII decades appear to be ones with a slow evolutionary drift from phenomenology into existentialism and Marxism since (as Sand1 notes) by 1943 he had published Being and Nothingness -- a foundational existential tract. Sartre describes WWII as having had a profound transformative influence on him: as a French soldier, a German POW and, after his release, an activist partisan living in Paris experiencing revulsion at being asked street directions by the always polite occupation soldiers. His post-WWII life was one of intellectual activism as an existentialist, Marxist and contrarian -- the years in which he wrote his greatest works. Finally, only the wiki article describes him in his last years as a disillusioned anarchist. Given all of that it seems to me that one can make the claim that Sartre's philosoph(ies) evolved significantly over the course of his life. Choosing to regard Sartre's life from childhood through to 1939 as a single period in which he wrote and taught is one possible partition. WWII and the publication of Being and Nothingness constituted a radical rupture from what came before and was, perhaps, another period. The post-war years of intellectual activism could constitute yet another period. But where is the moment, the inflection point, the span of time which partitions his life into the disillusioned anarchist of his last years? Typologizing may be an inherently human trait but typologizing anything is always problematic, reductionistic and fraught with heterogeneity, i.e., less than pure groupings. Ironically, critiques of periodizations are the stuff on which academic careers can be built. Regardless, typologies are useful heuristics insofar as they lend explanatory structure to otherwise formless streams of human experience, space and time. Sartre was an important figure and thinker in the 20th c. In his case some periodization of his life is both helpful and insightful. Thanks to all for these useful suggestions. 

I recently read an article describing how mathematician/physicist David Wolpert's research closed the door on scientific determinism. I have huge doubts about the implied conclusion, considering the fact that a result like this would have significant implications philosophically, but I haven't seen his work discussed in philosophical circles (Wolpert first demonstrated this in 2008). His work is also cited in the Wikipedia entry for "Laplace's Demon." If anything, I could see this result as having implications for the epistemology of determinism, as we might never be able to "know" that the world was indeed deterministic. But that is completely independent of whether or not the universe is ontologically deterministic. I'll mention that I am a strong proponent of causal determinism. Indeed I think true randomness is utterly absurd, as it would be almost akin to magic. If anyone has any input on whether or not this result actually demonstrates that the world can't be deterministic, I'd be happy to listen and further question my own worldview. But at first blush I am taking this to be a wild exaggeration. I will crosspost this to the physics and mathematics stack-exchanges as well (in consideration of Wolpert's background). 

It would seem that figuring out a solution to the paradox of analysis would be of prime importance to philosophers, especially considering the fact that conceptual analysis seems central to philosophical practice. The wiki page, however, seems to list under proposed resolutions simply biting the bullet and claiming analysis gives us no new knowledge (which seems slightly crazy, as writing bachelor = bachelor seems to give you something epistemically different from bachelor = unmarried man), or going the Quine route and rejecting conceptual analysis outright (which most philosophers don't seem to accept judging by a survey of the field). I'm almost positive the wiki page neglects to mention other possibilities when it comes to resolving the paradox, and I'm hoping the good people here can point me in the right direction.
