(The answer may be "it lets people see that a third party endorsed us" or "it will be a major convenience to our users and avoid them getting to the same place from the competitor's link." Or "oh, I didn't think of it like that, never mind.") Your formula is [Normally, usually, typically, in most cases, our original plan, the requirements we were given] [conflict stated directly.] [Ask for explanation of suggestion given that context.] For a person who just doesn't understand timelines, planning, budgets, and other "laws of physics" of a project, and makes great suggestions (or potentially great suggestions) at the absolute worst time, you need to remind them of these laws of physics. 

Here you are actually saying most of the things you claim you can't say, but worded in a way that emphasizes the positive things about the bank job. Everyone wants to be valued. Telling someone "you will value me" usually works. Banks especially are well known to value stability. Don't word it in a way that sounds lazy like "I won't have to work so hard" but instead focus on predictability and consistency. It is ok to list "I won't have to spend months at a time in another country" as a benefit, but be careful because there are of course engineering jobs (I have held them) that don't require traveling to another country. Convincing the bank you really want to work for them is important: they don't want to invest in hiring and training you for you to just decide "oh, I guess engineering was better after all" and go back. So make sure you answer that question, not "what do you bring to us that non-engineers don't", when you are asked. They know engineers bring something special: that's why they held the recruitment event. They also know quite a lot about you and your skills already. 

Now you're showing your deep knowledge of backyard safety and that you possess tools, but you're not hurting anyone. Now the point of this metaphor/analogy is not to correspond perfectly with the act of checking out an open wifi and discovering some machine names. It is to show you the emotional response this behavior can elicit. They invited you to their offices for an interview. You did something that is outside the norm of an interview, without permission or invitation, when they were not there to see you do it. And you criticized their operations in the same paragraph in which you told them what you had done. At least one of them was shocked and upset. The thought experiment above is to lead you to an understanding of those feelings of being shocked and upset. To leave the metaphor/analogy behind, how could you have handled this better? Instead of blurting out your results early in the interview, you could have waited until discussing the security aspect and then said "a lot of good companies have no idea that their networks are vulnerable to some of the newer attacks. I could run a 5 minute scan on your guest wifi if you like." You could of course make this offer with confidence because you already did it in the lobby :-). Now you're showing your skills and your tools, in the right context, and with permission. You even set them up a face-save that it doesn't mean they're idiots if you find something. When you find it, you can tell them that you know how to change things so that vulnerability will be closed. Now they want to hire you instead of being offended. 

I recognize some of your behaviours in people I have employed in the past. I understand you have to simplify things to fit within the format of a question, but it looks to me like you want a simple set of rules that are always followed. How much to communicate. What to do if a peer hasn't done a good job. How many emails to send. And when people and situations appear to contradict each other, you're frustrated and upset. If you worked for me, and I wanted to keep you around, I would have a number of personal chats with you to try to help you improve your judgement on these matters and gain the experience you need to make good decisions instead of relying on simple rules. Because the fact is there are no simple rules and what to do always depends on what else is going on. Let's take a simple example that a coworker has made a mistake, or taken too long to do something, or in some other way jeopardized the schedule. Now you're going to have to put your own time in to fix it. STOP. Why do you have to fix it? Does anyone else know what's going on? Have you informed (not necessarily asked) your manager what's happening? If you're going to take over and fix it, why do you need to tell your coworker all about how sloppy and low quality they are? Why not just use a supportive tone to say "I can fix it, it's probably the quickest thing to get us back on schedule" and later, tell your manager what happened? If you're not going to fix it, and it's not really your business, well again why are you being all direct and making sure your coworker knows your low opinion of their work? It's going to delay you? Tell them that - a fact about you, not a fact about them - and also tell your manager. And then see if there's something clever you can do (doing things in a different order perhaps) to mitigate the delay. Tell people what's going on. Not sending a ton of emails asking what to do, but making sure that important information about you (still waiting on those jpg's so I can get started) is shared with those who need it when they need it. Sometimes it's hard to see the difference between two things that appear the same to you. But sending an email or being direct that "you're late! this is sloppy! Now the project will be delayed!" is not that same as "I really need that by tomorrow morning in order to keep the project on time." If your emails are about your own self and what you need, and not about the other person and what they have done, you may find they are better received. If you focus on what is relevant and in scope for you (let's get this done on time, I need two days to do my part of it, you need to tell me what was decided in the meeting so I can write my document) and ignore what is not in scope for you (wow you're so sloppy, what a low quality team member you are, our boss should do something about you, you're disrupting the project) then both you and the recipient of your emails will be happier. Finally, when you're given direction from management, don't waste it by disagreeing with it or assuming it is wrong. Ask more questions. When you're rebuked for not pushing to get things done, ask "last month, you told me not to send that many emails again because it upset people. What would be a good way to push and get things done without upsetting people by sending too many emails?" IMPORTANT: do not use a tone of "ha! Caught you in a contradiction! So much for you correcting me eh?". Instead, sound like (and in your heart please try to mean it) you want to learn. They think these messages don't contradict. You don't. You're missing something. What you're missing could cost you your job or your chances of promotion. But they haven't fired you yet, so they are probably willing to teach you. Are you willing to learn? Or are you sure they're all just stupid? 

Most people like giving speeches about how clever their approach is, how everyone should know this but few people do, and so on. Breaking this habit will not be quick. But you're the manager and that should count for something. Ask good questions. Step in quickly to redirect if the wrong question is being answered. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. I think it would be disastrous to have a meeting with this person where you tell him that he speeches too much and nobody likes it. Just figure out how to get short and useful answers from him. Then encourage the rest of the team to use the same technique. Be a leader. 

I have offered this arrangement to my staff and am glad I did. It was worth it for me to keep a good member of staff. I hope your employer chooses to try it, but you can't force them to. 

You can learn a lot from what people do in these exercises. Not just that you say you're great, but what do you consider great? 

You will need different approaches for different announcements. This is a feature, not a bug. You need to think about how important your announcement is (hint: more important to some people than others), how urgent it is, and to what extent the announcement needs to stick around as reference material. I suggest coming up with 5 or 6 canonical examples. For each one, you will have a subject and an audience, along with the communication channel. Quick, probably not good examples: 

Don't talk about what you might do or why you might leave. Talk about what you want in a job. This manager may be able to give you that. Or be able to look you in the eye and say "we are never going to be able to give you that" -- and you know what that means. There is possibly some upside to saying what you want. There is absolutely no upside ever to saying that you will leave if you can't have it, or that you are already looking elsewhere. Even if you have me for a boss. 

This depends highly on the business you're in. A chef, for example, seems to follow a career arc that starts with visiting in person to hand over a resume and needs to rise pretty far up before an email or other electronic communication could start the ball rolling, even in a large establishment. Most office jobs involve a more "hands-off" application process, and that's what I'm familiar with. I've hired dozens of people myself, and advised clients during the hiring process (most recently a month ago) and these days, we get too many applicants. If you can't follow instructions, I don't even read your resume. I know that's harsh but it's true. So if I ask for emailed resumes and I get a comment on a blog post with a link to an online resume, or a twitter dm, or a phone call, or a visit - thanks for playing but you didn't follow the instructions. Now if you followed the instructions and emailed the resume, but then decided to do some extra thing to make sure that I gave your resume all the consideration it deserved, then I would think twice about hiring someone who doesn't mind interrupting my work to make sure they get what they want. I know books and articles are full of advice to "stand out from the crowd" and "put in a little effort to show them you're a go-getter who really wants the job" but trust me, it's a short distance from there to "that annoying guy who thinks all I have to do all day is reassure him on the status of his application" or "that desparate guy who pulls tricks to get his resume read - he's probably not that good". Be good at what you do. Build a resume that shows it. Stand out from the crowd by doing things all the time, not just while you're applying for jobs, and do things that help the world, not things that inconvenience hiring managers like visiting them at the office without an appointment. Join a user group, a professional association, and the like. Volunteer evenings and weekends doing something (related to your profession) for a non profit. Blog. These are not stunts, they don't look desparate, and they will make you genuinely better, which visiting people's offices will not. 

While generally you will be "given some slack" because your ankle is in a cast, you will find some people retain rules you cannot break. For example in many workplaces your toes are a part of you that must never be seen under any circumstances. You don't have experience in this workplace, so to be on the safe side I recommend: 

This may or may not be the law where you live, or be the terms of your contract, though there's an excellent chance it is. I simple adopt it as a way of living. This means that when I leave a project (and as a freelancer you always leave eventually) I leave behind my code, my plans, my diagrams, my brilliant explanations and fantastic ideas. They have been paid for. In a startup, you don't usually get paid what you're worth. There may be some money so you can live, but really you're all trying to build something together that you all own. When you leave that arrangement, you typically are compensated for what you leave behind. Emotionally, you seem to feel you're in this position. Yet you speak of your boss, and of being an employee. I suggest taking a big breath, and thinking of this whole thing as a great learning opportunity. Chances are they will not benefit from what you leave behind, since you feel they are so wrong on management and such. You will benefit from being seen as a generous and helpful person. If they turn out to be the next Facebook, you can tell everyone you helped to get that going.
