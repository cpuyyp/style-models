The review discusses much earlier studies in "children", but I selected these examples to demonstrate they were anaesthetising babies (as opposed to 10 year olds. I am sure no-one denies they feel pain.) So, this shows some doctors considered babies needed anaesthesia. The claims that some doctors considered babies to not require anaesthesia comes from a number of sources, many of which cite references that I have been unable to confirm. A Time Magazine article cites Dr. Robert Wilder, an expert on paediatric anaethesiology (I guess it is "pediatric anethesiology" as he is from the USA.) 

A number of injuries have been attributed to the practice of head-banging to music. The following list are individual case-studies, so should be considered little more than well-considered anecdotes. 

As you point out, Contactless Payment cards have a relatively low maximum transaction limit. [US$25 in the US and under £15 in the UK] While they are known to be breakable [Ref] that puts an upper limit on a single case of fraud. Where there are multiple, systemic frauds (as described in your example), the pattern is detectable, [Further reading], in which case the bank can reverse all transactions performed by that merchant (and perhaps start criminal proceedings). Banks are in a position can require high-levels of authentication for their merchants, require a merchant to leave a deposit or delay the outgoing payments to ensure that they can take remedial action. It is important to remember that payment systems do not need to be perfect to be profitable; they need only be better than the existing alternatives - neither cheques nor cash, for example, are risk-free. In summary: These systems are known to be insecure, but the banks can use measures to protect against rampant fraud. 

TL;DR: It's more complicated than the dichotomy "fat=jolly, slim=unhappy" or vice versa. It depends on culture. The report that this newspaper article was based upon is: 

Yes, there was a famous narrowband signal detected in 1977, which became known as the "Wow! signal". Whether it came from outer space is unknown. 

The authors summarised this as: The bad news is that despite the fact they set out to look at other factors ("calculus and stain removal, cost, dependability and adverse effects"), they didn't find a conclusion ("Cost, dependability were not reported.") In conclusion: While some electric toothbrushes mechanisms might be a little better than others, there isn't much in it (and I can stop looking, because if Cochrane didn't find it, it isn't there on the available evidence in the literature.) I can't answer whether the expensive ones correlate to the better ones. I can note, informally, that cost, when it comes to consumer goods, may be regional and more related to branding, colour, battery-life, dependability and other factors not related to the toothbrush's efficacy. 

None of this is strong enough to say "hypnotherapy doesn't work" or "hypnotherapy is worse than [whichever control treatment is chosen]", but it is suggestive that there's not enough difference to be worth spending your money. 

Do you count that layer as the yolk? If not, strictly, there are more infections in the albumen than the yolk. If so, you might get a practical measurement more like this: 

Each of the studies was considered "low to moderate" quality, so the existence of conflicting results is not too surprising. Of those 214, 26 were related to the key question here - water fluoridation and dental caries. They found that fluoride helps with caries: 

This answer is strongly based on a reference provided by @TechZen, so credit there. However, I draw a very different conclusion from it, and I didn't want to edit the answer that substantially... I decided to go with a separate Community Wiki answer. No, the bomb calorimiter values are not the definitive measure of calorific values. 

Other scientists were looking at natural fluoride overdoses (Source: Fluoridation Facts from the ADA): 

They looked at a number of different techniques psychological intervention techniques, some of which were significantly improved outcomes. When it came to hypnotherapy, however, the evidence was not clear. They only found one suitable study: 

Given just one day had passed between the press release and the the news report, it is clear that period has not yet expired. [I couldn't find it in the last few days of the Federal Register, so it may not have even been published yet.]

Ok, class, say it with me. Correlation does not imply causation. There could be many confounding factors that explain the correlation. In my original draft of this answer, I tried to show that religiosity is one such confounding factor. I showed that contraceptive use is inversely correlated with religiosity (Source). But when I went to show divorce rates were also inversely correlated to religiosity, I found that wasn't true - not even in the religious groups that eschew contraception! (Source) So, you will just have to come up with your own ideas for confounding factors... 

Partial answer only: Wax doesn't protect the car from acidic rain: Does wax protect from acid precipitation : Waxed automotive finishes in the Acid Dew and Fog Test, SCHULZ U.; ZWICK W., European Coatings Journal 1997, no9, pp. 784-790 

Note, the tweet has subtly distorted the message. The 5,000 Chicagoans includes all homicides (clear from the context) not just gun deaths. Now, to check those facts: Yes, the 2,000 U.S. soldier deaths in Afghanistan estimate is about right; a slight underestimate: 

Without peer-review and a proper literature search, there is a limit to how much we can trust these anecdotes. Further, these phones are old - not modern cell-phones. However, in each video, the phone is completely destroyed - the the microwave is sometimes damaged. It should be sufficient evidence to convince people that this claim is a hoax. 

The report is based on interviews, focus groups, market research and usage data from 11-35 countries. In Figure 4.2, it shows 48% of women are unconnected in low and middle-income countries in the Middle East & North Africa. That is not the exactly the same as "the Arab world", but presumably is the source of the claim. 

In summary, if your skin is undamaged, the nanoparticles can't get through. If your skin is damaged, there is no good evidence they get through, but more research is required. Retinyl Palmate 

It looks like the claim is no longer true. A writer at the Vegas Chatter blog was skeptical of this claim, and so decided to contact IGT, a gaming machine manufacturer. They were quoted as saying 

But the reasons they gave for the failures did not include that it was adulterated with sunflower oil: 

No. The source is apparently the World News Daily Report, which, as @Jamiec has pointed out, is a fake news site, by their own disclaimer, with stories like ferocius 3-metre-tall squirrels in Australia. Their article claims (my emphasis): 

Renault publish sales figures but only back to 2007. Automobiles Review concur with Top Gear, stating that, in July 1984: 

In July 2003, noted skeptic, James Randi, investigated the claim that Hira Raten Manek was being tested by NASA. 

One of two mentioned factors in precocious puberty is consumption of cow's milk (no reference provided). Cow's milk has a high fat content, and other bad things. These are all linked to early puberty. Hispanic child are less likely to consume cow's milk. (no reference provided). This argument peters out there. I see no actual claim that Hispanic children have later puberty as a result. 

(Note: An errata has been applied to this section.) Does aspirin reduce risk of cancers? Kind of. Maybe. No. Cancer is a big area; it isn't a single disease. Aspirin reduces the chance of some cancers from recurring. For example: 

The introduction of the phrase "pharmaceutical grade" here is a red herring. Most items we ingest are not pharmaceutical grade. The sugar you put in your coffee isn't pharmaceutical grade, and nor is the coffee itself. Why should the water be? The standard here should be "food grade", and the water coming from the tap (certainly in first world countries) is rigorously monitored and controlled. (I'd include a reference here, but it is dependent on your local government, so I can't give a universal answer. I have examined the regulations for a number of states here in Australia, and there are a huge number of pollutants tested for, including heavy metals.) Once the chemicals coming in are dissolved to 1 ppm (see other answer), the "small residues" are going to be diluted even further, making the issue of industrial versus food grade inputs irrelevant. It is the output that matters. 

Conclusion While attempts to answer with a definitive study are missing, by looking at the individual nutrients involved, whole-wheat bread offers more of a number of nutrients associated with better health, with a proviso that bran can reduce iron absorption, and that fortification of white-bread can remedy many of these differences. Also, white bread tastes better! :-) 

There are two separate claims here. 1) The Daily Currant says Georgia has legalised handguns. No, this is just a story from the Daily Currant which is a satirical magazine that invents stories. 2) That the image on the "17 Most Unusual Vending Machines" demonstrates that there is a vending machine that sells guns. No, this is just an donation drive, using vending machines as an analogy for simple purchase. As it explains in small-print 

However, this Flicker Fusion Threshold is a different measure to the minimum refresh rate to observe smooth movement by objects. Ref I don't want to argue whether a higher refresh rate is better in the case of television, because it is a subjective call. Some people argue that the algorithms used to interpolate movement when the input rate is slower than the refresh rate leads to an alien or artificial feel to the movement. 

Clearly, head-banging has been associated with injuries, including some fatal. The brain injuries appear to have had immediate effect. I found no evidence that long-term head-banging causes cumulative brain-damage, even in an article that attempted to summarise the risks. The biomechanical analysis did not warn against long-term use, but merely advised on prevention techniques. Nonetheless, these immediate risks should be considered when deciding whether head-banging is worth it. 

I haven't read this paper (paywall), and note that it isn't clear about which education level is being analysed here - secondary? tertiary? 

Yes. It appears to be a picture of the MV Blue Marlin - in fact it is written on the middle of the stern of the ship. 

The recommendations in this area vary, and the science they are based upon seems to be not entire resolved, but there's enough evidence to give practical recommendations. The Australasian Cochrane Centre published an Evidence Summary for the Early Cooling of Burns where they looked at a number of studies in 2009, including a systematic review that looked at 42 more. They concluded (emphasis mine): 

Cleve Backster's work was unreproducible by himself or others, and has been discarded as a working hypothesis. 

Yes, knives get dull in the dishwasher, through rubbing against other items. When I bought a set of nice Wüsthof-Trident kitchen knives, I heard this rumour too. I also heard that cutting onto a plate can dull them. As this was about 25 years ago, in the days before I had heard of the web, let alone a StackExchange, I wrote to my knives' manufacturer, Wüsthof, asking for advice. They kindly sent me a brochure which has this section (my emphasis): 

Twelve Weeks, Attrition These studies show a majority of patients drop out, but those who do are more likely to have started out thinking they couldn't control their weight. Fred R. Volkmar, MD; Albert J. Stunkard, MD; Joseph Woolston, MD; Robert A. Bailey, High Attrition Rates in Commercial Weight Reduction Programs Arch Intern Med. 1981;141(4):426-428. doi:10.1001/archinte.1981.00340040022010 

Leisure sickness appears to be loosely defined. Migraines could be considered to fit the profile. Migraines have a large number of trigger factors that are different per patient, but include sleep patterns and alcohol usage. As a result, the incidence of migraines varies by day of the week. 

So, Sean Spicer did not immediately correct that mistake. The source of the confusion is suspected to be a faulty Fox News report: 

So, we can dismiss the conjecture described in the question, because it doesn't match the data. How was this summary reached? Well, this isn't merely one small experiment. It is a systematic review, which means they carefully searched for existing studies, where possible consolidated the data, and drew a conclusion from that. They found seven quality trials, totalling 378 patients (fiber + non-fiber control) 

The lack of a dose-response curve is more evidence against causality. The paper discusses the possible reasons for the correlation. It does not claim causality. It does suggest that, perhaps, it is the employers' perception of the smoking employees that is the major factor. 

It extracted 55 high quality studies from a pool of 101 that looked at never-smoking women with smoking spouses. They found an increased risk of lung cancer, across each continent, with no evidence of publication bias. 

A friend was informed by his mechanic that his tyres were filled with Nitrogren rather than compressed air. He was skeptical of the claims he heard: 

As well as giving an overview, the Wikipedia page discusses many of studies on the effect, possible causes (including better nutrition) and the theory that it may be slowing down recently. 

This is illustrated in Table 4.3 of a 1997 report from the NHMRC Road Accident Research Unit of The University of Adelaide: Kloeden CN, McLean AJ, Moore VM, Ponte G, Travelling Speed and the Risk of Crash Involvement, Volume 1 - Findings. Their headline finding: 

In high-income countries, the risk of transmission of HIV from female-to-male is 0.04% per act [95% CI 0.01-0.14]. This sounds low - about 1 in 2500 encounters - but given the prevalence of straight sex and of HIV in women, that allows plenty of opportunity for HIV to spread to many people. In low-income countries, the risk is increased drastically to 0.38% per act [95% CI 0.13-1.10]), but the evidence is poorer. Genital ulcers increase the risk. Late-phase HIV infection increases the risk. Circumcision decreases the risk. These are the figures without antiretrovirals; presumably they would lower the risk. [I'd be remiss not to mention that condoms reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Please practice safe sex.] 

The word "scam" suggests fraudulence - a deliberate intention to deceive. It is a strong accusation, and we should be careful about wielding it without evidence. Given Leap Motion claim that they will not charge until the product is shipped and that they bill via credit-card, which enables consumers and the banks to recover their money if they charge without delivering, this is not a scam. That still leaves other options. It may be vaporware and never get delivered. The fact they had a unit to deliver to Wired [Hat-tip Oliver.] is evidence suggesting this is not the case, but not proof that they can get the item into production as planned. The Wired article warns:
