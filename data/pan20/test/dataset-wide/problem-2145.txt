So, because my partner has been offered an excellent position abroad and I would like to join them there, I am about to start a job hunt in another country. Unlike my partner, who was living there at the time of their search, I am still living in my birth nation. Other than the need to constantly request Skype interviews or similar (I can't fly for every interview), what obstacles can I expect in such a job search? Relocation would be from the East-Netherlands, to South-West England 

Though consensus seems to be going in the extremes, allow me to offer a third option: Wait until the start of summer. That way, if they do let you go earlier you have a useful way to spend your time already laid out with preparing for your studies -- getting back in takes some adjustment. At the same time, you minimize your risk of being out of work too early. Start of summer is just a ballpark, basically. Start giving notice when you know you could usefully spend your time if you would not be employed, but before being employed no longer becomes an option. This maximizes benefit to both you and your employer. 

I'd see it the opposite way. In a perfect world the first person who needs a new cartridge, gets a new cartridge. If you arrive there and it is empty, you are the one in need. 

I think contacting your university and requesting an updated degree would not be unusual or out of place here. You mention that they were quite aware of the struggle of definition, so they will likely be willing to accomodate your request if the curriculum truly has not changed. They may charge a small fee, but no more than they would for an extract, most likely. 

Number 4 is the safest, however, I think I'd be spending more time as an unemployed man, and I want to minimize that as much as possible. What option would be best in terms of employer convenience and minimal unemployment time? 

These outbursts are damaging the work environment and may emotionally affect the other employees. The work productivity is most probably affected, and as HR, it is your job to take action to keep your employees at their best possible shape to work productively for the company. You said you talked with him and I think that's great, but if it's still continuing, you have to devise other methods. Maybe he needs a short break from work to calm himself, or some other thing you can think of to improve his situation. But I believe action must be done, and it must be done fast. P.S. Take my advice with a grain of salt as I am no expert in these types of things. :) 

Here's my situation : I currently am in a contractual job and my contract will end on September. From the time of this posting, I would only be available 2.5 months from now. I am already seeing good job postings that I want to apply to, but I'm worrying that it might be too early that when I do get to the offer stage, it might be awkward to tell the employer that I'll only be available by the 1st week of October. Questions : 

Additional info : They know I already have signed a contract as I've told them, but they said they still want to go for an interview. 

in an aggressive tone (for me, and for other employees as well, as she exclaimed this in public) She sent a request to said employee to do task A, and the employee has indeed finished the task according to specifications. I read the request, and I confirmed that he did the job. The root of the issue, she said, is that he didn't do what she asked him to do exactly, basically, miscommunication. In an IT person's head, the job was done. I read it and interpreted it as such where he actually did the job correctly, when she actually meant something else. She has no IT experience (makes me wonder how she became a project manager in the first place, but that's for another topic), so she can't communicate very well with IT staff. What is the problem here, and what should I do? Is it the miscommunication? Her lack of IT knowledge? Or the badmouthing? Should I talk to my supervisor about this, and if so, how should I approach this? 

Simply put, when auditioning and consequently hiring actors theater companies do often have to distinguish by race or gender. How do they get around laws prohobiting these sorts of hiring standards? 

You'd be surprised how many people wear a shirt just because it looks fun, not because they have any affinity with the subject. You may well have recognised a character Jim only knows from his shirt! In other words: Don't assume an interest just because of iconography on clothing. (If you were looking at me right now, you'd think I'd graduated in a year I wasn't even born yet from a college I've never even visited) As for re-enforcing a dress code - have it match the role. I think your current reasonings for loosening the codes are fair, and should not need review based on this incident alone. 

Is it considered 'bad form', or presumptuous to include scheduling preferences for interviews in your initial application letter? For example "For interviews or other direct inquiries I am most easily available on Tuesdays and Fridays" If it IS considered "not done", how can you most efficiently communicate this information without a lengthy email back-and-forth? 

There is likely no technical breach of contract as the 7 day limit is defined by law, not contract. Unless said stipulation was repeated in your contract you are basically out of luck unless you are willing to start legal proceedings against your employer (which you at this point could do either under the contract act 1950 or the employment act 1955). That said, a better resource for this and similar questions is probably $URL$ as it specialises in discussing cases such as this. 

I think most likely JUST a presentation letter and references are frowned upon. That is, do not supply these without actual certifications (referring back to the sentence before it). A simple error of leaving a single word out in a different language. 

What are the advantages and disadvantages in inviting and accepting all people in your LinkedIn profile? Obviously the advantage is that you'd have a larger circle and you'd be easier to find for employers, but am I missing out on a disadvantage here? 

Given this, I personally think I could reduce the "unemployment" gap if I started applying early. However, given my vacation schedule, I wouldn't be able to attend interviews in that time period. These are the options I can see right now : 

Additional details : I am from Australia, and it might help if you give examples in Australia's work culture, however, general answers are also accepted since we aim this to be helpful for anyone, not only the ones residing/working in Australia. 

I found this as one of the more fun aspects of a profile in LinkedIn, however, I wonder if it even matters for employers and recruiters. 

I'm in quite of a bind here. Although this is unintentional, I've found myself in an awkward situation where I've been offered a job that I'm interested in while being on annual leave, and I'm not coming back for 1 more week. I'm currently overseas where coming back isn't an option unless I wait for my return flight which comes in a week. I don't exactly have the luxury of time to wait until next week to personally hand in my resignation letter, so I'm looking to do it by email. Is there anything I should be aware of? Anything ethics related, or when the notice period starts, and things I could do to smoothen the process? Thanks! 

I was wondering if some recruiters would see it as negative, thinking I might not be focused or committed to my permanent job if I had a freelance project on the side. Obviously, more showable work experience is an advantage, but I'm wondering if I'm overlooking some disadvantages in listing concurrent freelance projects. 

This certainly happens, but is more common in the training-to-job sector, where the recruiter provides training with a promise of a job at the end. Usually this is a service the applicant pays for and pays for MORE if they walk away before the "guaranteed" job is found. These companies usually benefit more financially from you giving up than 'selling' you, unfortunately... They present themselves as recruiters, but they are really not. Source: personal experience 

For the last couple of days, I have been having great trouble sleeping at 'normal' hours. I feel it is starting to affect my work, as greater headaches are starting to climb through the painkillers. That, however, is not the problem. I am sure I can get this issue under control soon enough, but what strategies can I employ to not have my current state of sleep deprivation show in the office? I work in an IT environment where I share a room with 7 others in a dual-island structure, so I cannot avoid sitting across people and needing to engage in casual development meetings. 

Assuming you're not first in line to hand in any 'privileges' you've been given through your own manager, there is little to do on an employee-to-employee basis. What you could do, however, is suggest to your manager that he could spread his work philosophy around the upper echelons of the company a bit more. Not only may this have a positive effect on your relationship with said manager (never a bad thing) - it may actually improve the attitudes of the other managers. The best part: if you ever get accused of meddling in other departments you could re-wrap the suggestion as a mere compliment towards the managing style. 

The situation : I'm the contracted web developer for my company (which isn't an IT company). They are using a legacy framework that almost nobody knows, has a very small community, and the general reviews on it are just plain bad. (makes me actually wonder why they picked it in the first place) In short, people with this skill are very few, and I'm the only one in this company with this job description. My contract ends soon and the company has offered me an extension. I was hoping to ask for a raise, stating several reasons, but on the back of my head, the main reason is because I know my company needs me and if they don't get me hired, their website won't be maintained. The question : Is the situation where one specific person knows that the company needs this specific person a reason worthy enough of a raise? 

I was fiddling with my Facebook security and privacy settings when I stumbled to this option (which I wasn't aware was controllable!). 

Additional info : I'm planning to leave, in case I can't work under Y directly. So I guess that adds to my negotiating power. 

Several resources indicate and suggest that you should not disclose your previous salaries in your past employments for the reason that there's a chance that the potential employer could "lowball" you and offer you a slightly higher salary compared to your previous, but a largely lower salary compared to their expected range. However, in the case of a history of a higher-than-average salary, should disclosing my previous salary be OK in terms of getting a higher salary? 

I am a contractor and my current contract ends on May 29. I have been in this position for a total of 3 contracts (including the current one), in contract lengths of 3 months, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. I am fairly sure that they will offer me an extension after this contract as I am the only one in this job position, and if I leave, they will have to find someone new to replace me. According to my contract, I have to give a two-week notice period, however, I believe that is not enough to both find, hire and train someone new. Given that, I would like to give a bigger notice period to my company, preferably 1 month. How should I approach my manager about this, and would it be 'polite' to do so? 

You are on the right track in thinking you are not being compared to the Senior employees. You shouldn't be. Odds are, they are getting paid a fair bit more than you are and are expected to perform in tune with that. That said, if development and growth is what you want - ask your manager about that rather than asking for negative feedback specifically. Your company may have set productivity/time benchmarks you have to hit to grow, and you may be hitting them. At the same time, 'time' may be your limiting factor as a good number of companies will only offer promotions every X years. Still, don't fret too much about it. Juniors have their role to play too. And apparently you are performing it well. 

These days in the IT Sphere it seems nearly mandatory to have some open source work in accessible GitHub account listed on your CV. As someone cursed with a laser-like focus when it comes to developing, I don't have the breadth of mind, energy or drive to code something ELSE in my spare time, away from work. What are alternatives to open source work to compensate for this modern 'gap' in my CV, and how can I present my CV in such a way the gap will be glossed over? 

You seem to be in a situation where, unfortunately, you are simply at their mercy. If there are no contractual clauses you could enforce (which from your description, there don't seem to be) and they are truly the only supplier with the means to deliver what you need, there is very little you can do. And it seems they know it. This supplier seems, at best, unreliable. Therefore, rather then trying to get him (it seems to be a single person?) to do what you want - try to find or create an alternate supplier. Do not make the same mistakes you have this time, and put down terms regarding access, deliverables and schedule. I wish you the best of luck.
