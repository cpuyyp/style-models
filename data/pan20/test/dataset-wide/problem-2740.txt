Property as a right of exclusion: First of all, it is necessary to understand what a "property right" is. Ownership of a piece of property entails a right of exclusion with respect to that property, which means that you have the prerogative to use it, but others need your permission to use it, and you may exclude them if you wish. Hence, if I own a pencil, that means I have the prerogative to use that pencil, and I can exclude you from using my pencil if I don't want you to use it. Effective ownership of property means that you must be allowed to use force to enforce your right if necessary. Hence, if you try to take my pencil by force, I am allowed to use (proportionate) force to prevent this. Since property ownership is a right of use and exclusion, a property right necessarily entails the ability to "forcibly deny that commodity to others". If this ability is absent, there is no effective ownership. Any theory of prerogatives with respect to property must have a theory of initial acquisition, but also a theory of what forms of property transfer are allowed/disallowed, and what happens in the event of an illegitimate transfer of property (e.g., theft). You are correct that the rules of initial acquisition under anarcho-capitalism is via the theory of "homesteading". Your account of homesteading a house from unowned lands, trees, etc., is correct. 

No, this is not a fallacy, nor even necessarily a false statement. The actual logical structure of the statement is merely "A implies B", which is not fallacious. As to the actual content of the statement, it is essentially an inference from a classification of a person into a type (X) to an inference about the knowledge they should have (Y). This inference might be a reasonable one, or not, but its basic structure is certainly not fallacious. There are many statements of this form that are reasonable inferences, and are true, such as the ones I have listed above. There are other statements of this form that are not reasonable inferences, where the inferred knowledge is not something that a person of the specified type should have. As to how to draw the distinction, that is a matter of statistical inference, not philosophy per se. 

Obviously no pre-linguistic child would gain any assistance from this definition, since the concept of "cat" is described in terms of higher order concepts ("domesticated", "carnivore", etc.) that the child will learn later on, after they already know what a cat is. If his mother tried to describe this to the child by pointing to the cat and saying "small domesticated carnivore", it would lead to confusion. However, to a literate adult, this definition assists in relating "cat" to the broader concept "carnivore" and other concepts. (And the perceptive adult will presumably notice that the first definition refers only to the subclass of domesticated cats, since not all cats are domesticated.) The infinite loop you are referring to would occur if you used the dictionary in isolation to try to learn language. If a thinking being (capable of forming language) was deprived of observation, and thereby deprived of ostensive definitions, it would not be able to form language from the dictionary. Without ostensive definitions, the dictionary would merely give a web of inter-related words, with no reference tying them to reality. Every definition would lead to a cycle in the dictionary, or an undefined term. (To deal with this shortcoming, some dictionaries have pictures, which gives some progress toward an ostensive definition, though a single picture is not really sufficient.) 

Zeno's arrow paradox is a redefinition of "motion": Quantum physics is not required to deal with Zeno's arrow paradox. The statement of the "paradox" works by invoking the idea of "motion" while only ever considering instants of time, and thus not considering motion as a concept that applies with respect to change over time. All that happens in Zeno's statement of the "paradox", and similar restatements by other authors, is that an assertion about "motion" is made on the basis of the position of a thing at a single instant in time; because a thing occupies a single space at an instant in time, it is "motionless", and since this applies at all instants in time, it is "motionless" at all instants in time --i.e., it is always motionless, and motion is impossible. Zeno's argument rests on a persuasive definition of "motion" which is different to its real meaning. In Zeno's argument, the concept of "motion" is a property of an object at a single instant in time; it bears no relationship to actual motion, as the concept is used by anyone. Striped of its persuasive definition of "motion", all the argument says is: at any instant in time, everything occupying space is in the same space it is in, and not some other space. (If there is any branch of physics that disputes Zeno's argument, it is not quantum physics, but regular classical mechanics, which quantitatively defines the concept of motion. Simple use of classic physics equations show the ridiculousness of trying to measure motion by position data at a single instant in time. However, even a pre-physics understanding of "motion" is sufficient to refute the argument, so long as you recognise that motion is conceptually describing change in location over time.) Zeno's argument is a classic case of a philosophical argument that tries to bamboozle people by simply redefining a concept to have a completely different meaning. Since the argument invokes the idea of "motion" but does not ever consider changes of position with respect to time, it is similar to (but not exactly the same as) the stolen concept fallacy. Once "motion" is correctly defined as change in position with over time, it is not correct to say that (at any given instant) an arrow is "motionless" merely because it occupies one space at that point in time. (Whether it is motionless or in motion cannot be determined by its position at a single point in time, but by the rate of change of position with respect to time, taken relative to some other existent used as a reference point.) A little rant about quantum physics and philosophy: This little rant is not a negative comment on the OP, or his question, but just something that needs to be said in the context of this question. People seem to have this ridiculous fetish for quantum physics, where they act like it solves all the philosophical problems of the world. (And no-one seems to have such a fetish for this as non-physicists.) Theory of mind? Quantum physics will solve it! Zeno's paradox? Quantum physics! Moral laws concerning lifeboat situations? Hell, let's try to apply quantum physics! This is a dead end --- quantum physics solves exactly zero philosophical problems. It is philosophy that is required to help interpret the data from experiments in quantum physics, to avoid making stupid mystical conclusions from this data. ("Oooh, the cat is both dead and alive - I have transcended the law of non-contradiction!") The vast majority of what is written about quantum physics and philosophy is mystical horse-shit, dressed in fancy pseudo-mathematical verbiage. With regard to the "uncertainty principle", it is a principle of epistemology, not metaphysics, and it merely circumscribes limits of our ability to measure things. Not only does it have no application to the existence or non-existence of motion, but it is a principle that makes reference to motion, and therefore pre-supposes that motion is a thing. 

There are a lot of false premises in this question. (As Rand would say, "check your premises".) Firstly, it is not true that socialism is usually supported by the lower classes, or that they stand to gain from this system. Historically, it has almost always been the case that progress to socialism is driven by a "vanguard" of wealthy elites (often being the offspring of wealthy capitalists), and it is this class (who will become the nomenklatura of the socialist state) that benefit under socialism. Indeed, it was Lenin's great frustration that the workers were not revolting against capitalism, and he argued ---contra Marx--- that a vanguard of intellectuals was required to undertake this task. Now, with regard to Objectivism, one of the key tenets of its moral philosophy is that the initiation of force is immoral, and that this gives rise to individual rights, which are recognitions of the fact that it is wrong for individuals to be aggressed against by others. This would include the appropriation of a person's property against their will, which is required under socialism in order to place the means-of-production-and-distribution in the hands of the state. Objectivist moral philosophy recognises that the initiation of force does not become okay merely because it is done in an organised manner, or by a large group of people (e.g., by the state). Since Objectivism objects to the appropriation of property, it opposes the drive of socialism to put the means of production into the hands of the state, and other aggressions that occur under socialism. Objectivism also does not equate "selfishness" with doing whatever you want. That is a subjective view that is rejected in Objectivism (and usually associated with Nietzche). This is the reason that Rand often predicates this term by referring to "rational selfishness", and stressing that what is actually selfish is a matter of discovery according to reason. The Objectivist view of socialism is that it is a system in which a privileged elite within the state engage in systematic theft from the population, thereby violating the non-aggression principle of Objectivist moral philosophy. Rand argues that this system is motivated by appeals to envy, and is an immoral system of governance. She argues that free-market capitalism is the only moral system of governance, since it is the only system that obeys the non-aggression principle (though there are many arguments on this point between anarcho-capitalists and Objectivists). 

Marx based his analysis on a theory of history that has been called "historical materialism", whereby the structure of production in a particular society is the determinant of human social relations. Marx argued that a particular structure of production gives rise to the class relations in society, and tensions in these structures eventually cause them to become unstable and collapse, which then leads to the next stage of development of production. In addition to this general theory of historical forces, Marx had a specific theory for how history would play out. In schematic terms his theory was: Primitive Communism ==> Slavery ==> Feudalism ==> Capitalism ==> Socialism ==> Advanced Communism At the time Marx wrote, the capitalist mode of production had overthrown feudalism. Marx argued that capitalism had its own internal tensions that would lead to its destruction in favour of a socialist system. In particular, he argued that it would lead to rising misery for the working class (gradually lower wages, worse conditions, etc.), which would cause them to revolt and establish a socialist dictatorship (the "dictatorship of the proletariat") that would appropriate the means-of-production. Engels argued that life under the dictatorship of the proletariat would gradually lead to the internalisation of socialist relations in the social habits of men, which would in turn render state-enforcement unnecessary, which would lead to a "withering away" of the state, resulting in a communist society. As to whether Marxism is correct about this, well, you can judge that for yourself. Contrasting Rand with Marx (and reading Sowell's book on Marxism) is an excellent way to hear some arguments on either side of the issue. As to your mention of some of Marx's specific criticisms of capitalism, it is certainly true that Marx had views on "alienation" of people from their work, and appreciation for leisure, etc. But these are secondary to his theory of history and the structure of production; they constituted some of the reasons that he had a negative view of capitalism. (He thought that capitalism was a necessary stage of history, but that its time had passed.) 

Axiomatic concepts are circular (i.e., they correctly "beg the question") The article you are quoting follows a similar reasoning to Rand's discussion of axiomatic concepts and the stolen concept fallacy. That is, the author is saying that various purported reductions of consciousness to other concepts constitute a denial of the existence of consciousness, and since these denials use consciousness, they are contradictory. Rand made the same argument when she put forward her views on the axiomatic concepts that are at the base of metaphysics (one of which was that consciousness exists). As Rand describes it: 

Both utilitarianism and altruism presume the ability to judge the degree to benefit of an action to oneself and others. Utilitarianism holds that actions should be chosen to maximise the aggregate benefit to all people ("the greatest benefit for the greatest number"), whereas altruism holds that actions should be chosen to sacrifice your own benefit for the benefit of others. In both cases the goodness of an action is judged by a weighted aggregate of the benefit of an action to all people in society --- in utilitarianism each person is weighted equally in this aggregation, whereas in altruism the benefit to the decision-maker receives a negative weighting (i.e., self-sacrifice of the decision-maker is considered to be good). This difference is described quantitatively in the framework of decision-theory in my answer to a related question here. There will certainly be individual decision-problems where the optimal action under utilitarianism coincided with the optimal action under altruism. This will tend to occur in cases where there is a large aggregate benefit of an action to others, and the benefit of the action to the decision-maker is small enough that it makes no difference whether this is given a positive or negative weighting in the optimisation problem. However, although there are going to be particular decision-problems where both ethical systems recommend the same action, there will also be problems where they diverge, so they are not the same. In cases where the benefit of an action to the decision-maker is large, utilitarianism will tend to recommend that this action should be taken (so long as the loss to others is not also large) whereas altruism will recommend that this action should not be taken. Summary: Utilitarianism does not require altruism, though it will coincide with altruism in some decision problems. 

Rand's moral philosophy is normative (obviously) and derived from consideration of consequences, but it is not consequentialist in its framing of moral principles and rights. Rand argued that moral philosophy requires principles that can be applied in the absence of the ability to foresee particular consequences, in the sense of the full outcomes of actions. Consideration of consequences from action justify the moral philosophy (the inquiry for which occurs at a broad level of considering the kinds of consequences that flow from broad classes of action --- e.g., honesty, dishonesty, etc.), but the principles of that moral philosophy are not framed in terms of consequences. This aspect of Objectivism being "consequentially motivated" without being consequentialist is addressed in great detail in Smith (1995). Smith argues that the Objectivist moral philosophy is neither deontological nor consequentialist, but instead it is "teleological". For example, on the topic of rights, Smith notes (following the Objectivist moral philosophy) that: 

** By way of comparison, this is about 10-20% of the results for some very famous philosophers like Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper. So she is less commonly studied than those philosophers, but still quite high. 

Asking "why" there is "something" (i.e., existence) is conceptually invalid: To ask "why" such-and-such a state of reality exists is implicitly to ask for a more detailed causal account of how things act to bring about this state. So if a person asks, "why is fire hot?" they are implicitly asking for a more detailed causal account of the heat of fire. A reasonable response to this might explain that fire is the oxidisation of certain materials, and explain why this physical process produces heat; a deeper explanation might further explain heat and temperature in physics terms and give a more detailed account of what "heat" actually is. One could ask an initial question like this, and then keep asking "why" at each explanation, and in each case, the respondent would attempt to provide a deeper account of the causal process, by going into more detail on the causal physical processes at work. What is important here is that asking "why" is a question about causality, and the answer is always to give a more detailed causal explanation. So, when you ask "why is there something instead of nothing?", you are asking for a deeper causal account of the creation of "something" (i.e., a causal account of the existence of existence). This means that you are asking for a causal account for how "something" came to exist from a previous state that was not itself "something". Which means: you are asking for a causal account of how "something" is created from "nothing". Which means: you implicitly presume that something could not have been the start of things to begin with, and it must have sprung out of nothing. By the very nature of "something" (i.e., existence) there is nothing else outside of it, and so there is no thing or time outside of it. There is no preliminary state from which "something" could be the causal result. Hence there can be no causal account of the existence of "something" and so there is no "why". (Incidentally, your question relates to a funny little experience that parents of young children have when little children incessantly ask "why". Parents of young children will be familiar with the fact that there is a limit to one's explanatory capacity when the child keeps asking "but why?" at each step of an explanation. This limitation represents the fact that deeper accounts of causality have a limit, though in the case of explaining things to a child this is more of a pedagogical limit than a metaphysical limit. Nevertheless, you can see that eventually there must be a starting point.)
