But forget about that. If gravity goes down, the atmosphere becomes less dense. Which would have a big effect on winds, oxygen levels (thus plant growth, animal life, etc. etc.). Temperatures would go down, further hurting plant and animal life, which likely has even greater negative effects as it would mean more desert style areas. 

A species that reproduces very slowly may not even be interested in expansion, as they may quite likely never feel population pressure, which in most species is the main reason to seek new areas to live in. 

Your criteria make little sense. In your pacifist society there's no need for regulation and bans on weapons, as people have no interest in using them on each other so they're used exclusively for sports and hunting. That situation can only arise if crime is just about non-existent, which in itself can only happen if there is no greed (note I don't speak about no poverty, there will always be a level of relative poverty where some people have more than others, it's just that in your ideal world people wouldn't mind others having more than them and people in real need will find charitable organisations and individuals eager to help them). Armed forces are by their very nature capable of offensive operations. This stems from the truth that the best way to defeat an enemy is to take the fight to him. A purely defensive force would eventually be overwhelmed easily. If there is no crime there's no need for police... How are you going to deal with religions that by their very nature are discriminatory/exclusive and/or violent towards outsiders (which includes a lot of religions, including at least one of the major world religions we have today)? They'd either have to be forcibly banned from the country (so no religious freedom) or they'd find it a very easy target for forced conversion and the elimination of everyone else, ending your state of pacifism quickly. Your atmosphere of safety and harmony can only exist if there is no crime. If you forget about the struggles that brought about your current society you're rapidly going to lose the benefits of that society as people forget what sacrifices were needed to bring it about and become greedy for the wealth of their neighbours. The first wave of muggings and robbery/murders won't be far behind. Privacy won't be valued, as people won't feel the need for it. And it can't exist as the only way to force people into being friendly and meek towards each other is constant highly invasive surveillance, cameras and microphones recording every conversation, censorship of all media (which you yourself already hinted at several times), police coming in the middle of the night to take away to "reeducation centers" those who so much as are suspected of harbouring thoughts that don't meet with approval of the government/ruling body/whatever you want to call it. 

The point I am trying to make through all this? It's far more complex than 'speeding it up'. You'd have to find a way to speed up each of these processes, and do so without creating a creature that won't buckle under the strain of the over-hyped craving for nutrients (they might starve to death while eating a meal, because of how 'slow' the body absorbs nutrients). Personally, if you were to through with this? Either get into the science behind it (biology, physiology, pathology), or try to steer clear of the STEM junkies that gorge on these details during any work of fiction, and are often left wanting. I would like to put more, but LORD! My poor brain and fingers are worn out:P 

in other words the mages are invincible (they can revive each other at will), innumerable (they can create copies of themselves as well as armies of minions at will), unblockable (they can go anywhere), and have unstoppable power to block attacks as well as to attack themselves. If I were that SEAL team I'd just order some lattes and watch the pyrotechnics as the relic gets stolen, there's no way I could stop them anyway. Typical example of boundless magical abilities, a very bad idea if you try to make a reasonable, interesting, plotline. 

And even today not all mines fall into the latter category. For example the US Navy employs or employed the so-called CAPTOR mine, which operates by detecting a ship or submarine within its vicinity and then launches a small homing torpedo (of the same type typically used by ASW helicopters) at that target. A space mine could work along the same lines, launching a guided missile at the detected ship. Another variety could have a high power X-ray laser fed by a nuclear explosive. When a target is detected, the mine orients on the target, the explosive detonates, and a high energy pulse of X-rays is fired at the target as a result, destroying the mine in the process. Again, something similar has been done on earth, most famously the shooting aparatus installed by the East German government on the fences surrounding their country to shoot those attempting to flee, which would detect breaking wires in the fence and shoot towards the likely point of breach. These were single shot (or salvo) and could be reset and reloaded of course. 

Evolution is a process of seeing what works best in the subject's environment. Though this is a process that takes thousands-to-millions of years, there are times when this process is sped up considerably: a population bottle-neck. This is when it's easiest to see what little changes are the most beneficial. Then the fastest runner, or the longest runner, or the one that carries the most weight wins out--should any of those traits be seen as desirable to a mate. But you're talking about humans. Humans no longer follow 'survival of the fittest'. Now it's the one with the cute backside, or the highest intellect. That creates a problem, because if you cannot predict what the 'desirable trait' is, you cannot saw how evolution will pan out. So, I guess it's anyone's guess--but I hope the first part helped somewhat 8-) 

So your ecosystem would have to be such that megafauna exists, and has the plant and animal life for it to feed on, in order to sustain the shark population. The few blue whales (and other large whales) in our oceans will probably not do, they're too few and far between to provide reliable sources of sustenance to a viable population of megasharks. 

Being a red dwarf, it will have a relatively high percentage of its energy output in the infra red part of the spectrum. The planet will be bathed in a dim ruddy light, with lots of infrared energy warming it up. The star will likely be far less volatile than our sun, so don't expect short duration climate cycles like El Nino. Climate will be a lot more stable overall. 

Then, you need to identify what you consider intelligence. Brain size? Elephants have bigger brains than us, but I don't see them in labs conducting experiments. Tool usage? Chimps use tools, but same as the elephants -- no chimp scientists (though we do carry out experiments on them, so they are 'in the lab'). Hope this helps ^_^ 

CVA's (Cerebral Vascular Accidents), which strokes fall under, can take many forms and the causes are equally varied. The thing is, the causes each take months, years, or decades to build up enough to cause them, so three days aren't going to make a whole lot of difference. If the cause is a clot forming (which is the root cause for two types of stroke), then blood thinners could save her life. Most doctors would need to see the patient, but even in the third world, doctors should be trained to deal with that (getting them to care is not something I will debate, however) If, however, you are travelling back in time. Maybe travelling further back will be more fruitful. Changing her diet a decade in the past will certainly prolong her life, but it would depend on you how to get her to do so. But that brings me to one key question: why save this life? Surely the harsh reality hasn't evaded you? That people die all the time? Or perhaps even more curiously, what caused the need to save her, when far more influential people would certainly be more deserving? 

genetics is a good start. A certain mix of genes together determines whether the body has the means to perform magic (and one of those genes is recessive on the X chromosome). Diet may have something to do with it as well. Maybe the planet grows a plant which contains a chemical that when consumed suppresses magical ability (or conversely, enhances it). You can play with that in several scenarios, see what happens. For example a person needs to be genetically inclined towards magic while also having a rare genetic disorder making her allergic to that plant so she can't eat it (while it is staple food, and thus consumed by the vast majority of the population on a near daily basis). But even if the latent power is there, training is also needed to unlock it, and a long standing taboo on performing magic in many rural communities (where the genetic makeup needed is most prevalent) makes practicing magic something most people will never consider. Your recruiters will have to scour the land, visiting villages and looking over the young girls for signs (who knows what those are, maybe the rare allergy leaves them with discoloured eyes). 

How to earn bonus points? Why, thank you for asking! At E-conglomo, we really love underlings that know how to grovel like they mean it! Please note the following, simple ways to make us want to remember your name (or not kill you for no apparent reason): 

First is the surface goal. This is what you tell the masses, what you allow everyone to hear and talk about. It needs to speak to the masses. So if they are oppressed? Freedom therefrom. If they are hungry? Food for them and their families. If they are poor? Equality and fairness, so that everyone can reap the rewards of their labours. 

A house divided unto itself cannot stand. So create that divide in the enemy. Find out every possible division point amongst them, and drive a wedge in there. Stir up old rivalries, play on racial divides (but make it look like they are the ones doing all the dividing, you're the good guy after all!). 

it's certainly technically possible to have impeller driven water jets and other means to pump water through a pipe exist. The idea was floated (no pun intended) in Tom Clancy's Hunt for the Red October, and I see no reason why something like that submarine could not be built. But it won't be fast. While small craft using such systems can reach high speeds, it's a matter of diminishing returns. As the tubes get wider and longer they become less efficient, thus a larger craft has less benefit from them as compared to a smaller one. In Clancy's novel the system was designed to allow the sub to travel extremely quietly at low speed, for high speed travel the propellors were engaged. 

Well, this wouldn't be a sudden change. Robots aren't free -- and likely aren't cheap. So this is something that we can easily assume would take years, if not decades or generations to really happen. Based on this assumption I offer you my thoughts (hypothesis) on a plausible progression. It would start in factories where there is currently a high(er) error occurrence or low(er) error tolerance. Think welding, assembly and such (many of which are already being done by machines today, but not unanimously). These are jobs that (usually) require quite some training, but are fairly low-entry. Then it would take over the construction industry (starting with high-risk, such as high-rise buildings), but slowly working its way into all niches of the construction industry. Farmers would soon start considering buying a few robots. Starting with the bigger farms, because they have bigger budgets. Slowly, all the jobs usually offered to those with lower educational backgrounds, will no longer need them. So those with learning disabilities, low socio-economical backgrounds, and yes immigrants, will slowly be phased out of the workforce. They will be forced to start getting more and more creative over time, because everything they can do, a robot can do better, for longer, and over long periods will be done cheaper. This will start a period of social unrest. People with higher positions will start getting nervous, people will start complaining. This happens with all forms of change, but especially now because robots seem to be everywhere. Suddenly you'll start noticing robots in restaurants, replacing waitresses. Customers (especially those who've felt the sting of being replaced) will complain about the 'trash compactor' that brought the wrong order (or purposely giving them the wrong order just to make them look bad). There might even be those who find it funny (kids especially, but plenty of adults) that will start talking funny just to throw off the robots' speech recognition software. It's around this point in the transition that society would have to make a decision. After all, more and more people are starting to file for unemployment. More and more small business owners that can't afford to buy robots will file for bankruptcy because they can no longer compete. The government might start an initiative to offer financial aid to small businesses to help they buy a robot, or there might be a tax cut offered to those who hire unemployed people. Maybe both. Slowly, people who don't want to starve or become homeless will be forced to go back to school. I'm sure the government would have to offer some kind of financial aid in this, or risk entire social groups being unable to do anything but collect unemployment. So, over the course of a few generations, more and more people would have to work their way up from 'low social classes', to middle class or preferably upper middle class. This hypothesis is based on what happened during the industrial revolution, though extrapolated slightly because of the more socially geared society we (seem to) live in. Take away the 'easy road', and people will be forced to work themselves up, or risk starving in the long run. Let alone the risk of no longer being a 'viable mate' by their preferred gender (should they have one). Social pressure is a hell of a motivator, but this is only one plausible route. You could go for a more dystopian route, where the lower classes are systematically sabotaged and slowly start to either die out (not likely) or find other means of survival. It could even go so far as to develop a fringe society, tribal almost. They'd be forced to either steal to survive, or the more prideful of them would develop new means of farming. Most would find a balance between the two.
