There is an amazing stretch called the Lotus Lunge, sometimes called Pigeon, and it is probably the best stretch for getting deeper into your seated lotus. $URL$ Kudos on wanting to honor the most excellent way to sit (imho) 

"Turn to your experience" Simply go as deep as you can go with each word. Try and apply the word "abiding" to what is going on around you right now, then to your body, then to the totality of your undivided experience of the world. Try and view the world from a frame where one could catch a glimpse of the flicker between moments. What is that? =) Arising, Abiding, Cessation ... all of these together are "change" but the wording is very particular here: abiding is a process of sustaining, that is: something is upheld by causes and the context much like how a tree holds out a branch, whereupon there is a leaf, whereupon there is a ladybug, for now. cessation is also a process, the translator clearly opted for "cessation" as opposed to "cessating" because it would be strange, but the -ing makes for better contemplation because cessation or cessating is also a process, the process of dissolution of one entity, because whatever was sustaining its causes burned out or the context shifted ... micro and macro terms for the "same thing" arising is the process of becoming, the process of manifesting, and this is precisely what Noble Arya Nagarjuna illuminates with Madhyamika (or middle-way) reasoning in his composition Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way For sake of completion to this answer, i'll add some words about arising Arising is also no doubt a process; that of manifesting, as mentioned above. Arising, the more we investigate it, can be seen to be a spontaneous (in-the-flash-of-the-moment) process yet there is clearly some sort of trajectory between qualities of moments. In order to investigate on this level, one needs a lot of calm. So first ones neural activity has to be very relaxed and near a state of homeostasis, which is Shamatha or Calm-abiding, the Tibetan term is Shi-nay. Then there is insight meditation, it's possible for some people to really be able to get a perfect brief fissure/upheat of awareness and thereby polish their wisdom, but for the most part, and for sustaining clearer and more open / bare forms of attentiveness, it's crucial and wonderful, necessary and also exhilarating to develop a strong meditation practice. That is, meditating every day for at least 30 minutes. Just make time to sit and at least try and stay undistracted for that long, and when a good settling fits, try and crank up the light on your personal experience of the moment and its transitionings. With consistency and quality of meditation time, you are gradually making the conditions more and more perfect for something to happen. Which is why we must totally discard the notion of expectation, and totally discard the notion of happening. We are not investigating what will happen, we are investigating how everything is currently happening and therefore, ah i just adore the phrase, "turn to your experience." 

Maintain extraordinarily sharp attentiveness to your body as you fall asleep. Your day-time meditation practice will have to be regular and consistent, without a daytime practice dreamtime practice will not really have a foundation to rest upon. When you fall asleep, train yourself to stay aware of how all your limbs feel, the tension or laxity in your body, and the gentle rise and fall of your breath. That is, in my experience, the best way to maintain aware levels of mind while falling asleep. You must be able to observe without interfering too much, and that is why a daytime meditation practice is important. If you set your intentions just before bed strongly, with the intent to further your practice and realizations in your dreams in order to bring ultimate benefit to all sentient beings and all that lives, you will make progress quickly. There may be a few days where nothing happens, but if you keep to it, one day you shall break through. As you fall asleep, keep your mind on your body energy and warmth, and you can use the physical body as an anchoring point for your attention until the falling away of gross perceptions takes place 

Well, not to get too academic in one's understanding, but it would be advisable to check out The Five Strengths $URL$ Which are also known as The 5 Powers, The 5 Spiritual Powers. Edward Conze calls them The Five Spiritual Faculties. $URL$ This article by Sarah Doering from 1999 is really awesome from what I can tell so far 

Listening, Studying, Reflection are vital. Assuming you practice sitting meditation with joyful investigation for ~30min a day, you can probably have a direct insight into emptiness from one of the excellent sutras such as the Diamond Cutter Sutra or the Heart Sutra. It will take a lot of consistent practice but every step is closer, so in short: Grow your bodhicitta. Cultivate a deep compassion and weep for the sufferings of all countless sentient beings. Rest in the absolute nature. Love your teachers 

Dogen-ji made a statement of similar magnitude by saying "Space has no gaps." I will stop there, at risk of becoming too philosophical. The teachings are meant for experiential understanding. Words will help, but like reading a menu or eating a meal, the actual experience is what counts. For now, know that the present is dominant and that both future and past must borrow from Now in order to even come into question. 

If you enjoy thinking about [the world/scene/experience] in terms of vibrations, you might consider harmonic spots or resonant lengths along a wave as being able to build up and "accumulate" Have also heard of the aggregates spoken of as "heaps" 

$URL$ Since that encompasses the whole totality of the cosmos, the buddhas in question are all the supremely enlightened ones -- clear as day to a purified mindstream. 

rebirth means life to life or moment to moment? (both are possible and to my knowledge interchangeable.) Anyway, how can we fit this question or understanding into suffering and the end of suffering? Buddha would not say "cultivate absorption, realize ultimate reality, free yourself" if it were not possible for us to do so. Is it rare? Probably. Is it something that we all have access to as human beings? Yes. 

Keeping our practice from straying into the imaginal/conceptual is vital. Thus, training ourselves to be present with and aware of our bodily sensations is really wonderful. On top of that, the senses of touch, smell, taste, sight, and sound are all non-conceptual information, and concentrating on perceiving any one of those is a very skillful practice. 

These are the recent words of a very kind teacher of mine, may they be a cause for everyone to reach true relaxation of body, speech, and mind. Sit for short periods and sit with good quality of meditation. Quality over quantity. 

I don't think that that would be considered a valid interpretation because selflessness is one of the three marks of existence and therefore stating that any phenomenon had an enduring self-nature would be something to investigate more deeply and with an open-mind. That said, we all have Buddha Nature, which is precisely what the maha pari nirvana sutras speak of because sentience in its most natural and un-inhibited form is actually pure enlightened nature in manifestation and pure manifestation in nature. it is not something that is easily understood because it completely challenges the entire notion of a separate self that is the benefactor of our experiences. that is to say, it is not that we lack autonomy -- we have the ability to steer our ship, and as it is stated in many places with epithets such as "mind over matter" or in the opening verses of the Dhammapada, the mind is the king. Mind is the fore-runner of all phenomena. In this way, we can talk about an "enduring substance" but it would be folly to assume that we could actually "grasp" onto it or hold it still for a second, because this is actually the Experience and not the Object of experience, as it were. So consider that we all have Buddha Nature, that there are countless Buddhas actually walking around among us, and that our whole experience is actually a continuous process of enlightenment, however it is very important to share knowlege, honor teachers, and grow together because this trip is far more far out than any individual aspect could understand, so in short I simply want to add that mind is indestructible and continues forever, however it is not a "soul" because a soul would have some sort of limitations obscuring omniscience. Buddha Nature is the uninhibited mind in manifestation and can only be realized through a mind founded upon the notion of renunciation, because belief (firm belief) in the notion of an enduring existence or situation is precisely what causes the evolving cosmos cramps. "They are growing pains" is something some zen masters say, and knowing life situations in this way can be truly helpful and liberating. So during anapanasati meditation, the whole focus is the breathing, single-pointed focus on the rhythm of breathing, it's a dynamic flowing event stream, so try and stick with it. Ideally you start with a support, and the breath is wonderful because the breath is nonconceptual -- it is something you can directly feel and experience without labeling it that or this. Please ask any questions, I am happy to share what I have learned so far on this path. May this help.

Back to your question more directly: what should you focus on in a dream journal? Well, if you are doing it correctly, or at least how I believe to be correct, you'd have your journal near your place of rest, you'd be able to access it and the writing device and convey a dream to paper with minimal posture-change, and you'd be able to reflect for a minute on the whole contents of the dream scene-by-scene or aspect-by-aspect and simply dump them onto the page. One continuous run-on sentence for a dream transcription is perfectly fine. Be sure to note any texts or syllables or words you see, perhaps for later study or investigation, especially if you have a regular practice of faith, devotion, study, meditation and the like. Otherwise, know that it is dreams. Some are prophetic, some are vascular banter, thus your focus must also be somewhat intuitive to attest to the "truthfulness" of a dream, if I may be so liberal with my verbiage. With all things, our focus can be on the awareness-that-knows-content and not so much on the content itself. I would also recommend not reading your past journal entries for a long time. As a trained scientist, it would be folly to mix sample data with experimental input over the course of a study (e.g. your old dream data, being read over again might influence your future dreams). The dream journal has many benefits, but mainly it is the ability to recall a dream completely, and at more advanced stages affect the dream "from within" for deeper understanding and training. 

Approaching causal and effectual reliance through "times" Past, Present, and Future are the three times. Future, Past, and Present equally depend on each other. If you try and draw a triangle with only one line or two lines, it is impossible. All three need to be in place for the totality of "time." In this way, it might be possible to reason more clearly about how causes depend on effects. Approaching co-emergent phenomena via phor Your question seems to be "okay causes lead to effects, but why do causes depend on effects?" Two people high-fiving requires a silent clap from both sides. The beach (of sand) and the shore-line (of water) depend upon one another. To say there can be a beach without water is to have a desert. To have water without a shore-line is not a shore, but an ocean. Thus, investigating The nature of where they meet Noble Nagarjuna, in Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way states 

All sentient beings have Buddha Nature. Wisdom realizing the holy state of Emptiness and Compassion for all sentient beings uniting. The above gatha is part of the Diamond Cutter or Vajra Cutter sutra. Contemplation of the above gatha is one of the most amazing actions one can pursue in their lifetime! Happy you chose this one to investigate. Please read about the benefits here: $URL$ And please see the direct resource (Vajra Cutter Sutra) via the Tibetan lineages $URL$ Or this resource (the first one I came across) $URL$ 

Glad to hear you are interested in the end of suffering. Buddha laid out the Four Noble Truths as his very first sermon/teaching and they form the foundation of all Buddhist schools and thinking. Don't be fooled into thinking it is a pessimistic doctrine simply because it talks so much about suffering. The basic idea is that everything in the world arises due to causes and supporting conditions. This is like saying that everything that you feel, see, taste, sense, smell, touch, and experience, arises due to causes coming together in the proper conditions. A cause is like a seed and the proper conditions are like fertile soil.. water.. sunshine. When all the conditions are there and the cause is present, there will be a result very naturally. This is the way things are. Buddha taught, out of compassion for the plight of all sentient beings, that some actions (of body, speech, and mind) are wholesome and some are unwholesome. Those which are wholesome and virtuous are the causes of happiness, those which are unwholesome are the causes of suffering. By abandoning that which creates the causes of suffering, and by acting in ways which create the causes of virtue, one is gradually eliminating the possibility of suffering to manifest in ones experience and increasing the growth and abundance of happiness, prosperity, joy, wealth, comfort, ease, and so forth. Now, if you want to know more about what actions are harmful and which are helpful, you can read sutras and learn the teachings and thanks to our karma this life we have a good connection with the Buddhas and we can learn a great deal to eliminate what are known as the Obstacles and Obscurations from our mind streams. Mindful awareness is indeed the greatest remedy of all. With consistent practice, virtuous actions naturally increase and defiled actions naturally decrease. One is no longer ruled or overcome by thoughts, and does not need to identify with emotions or thoughts, and one gains freedom from the extremes of "existence" and "nonexistence" as those are also just thoughts. Historically, the Buddha laid out what is known as the Noble Eightfold Path. They are like 8 threads which weave together to form a complete solution to our how-does-one-live-a-good-life question. It is still very much about using our knowledge and understanding to make wise choices, but I think you would benefit from checking out this fundamental presentation of the way to the end of suffering. Contemporary teachers and Buddhas of our day teach a variety of approaches, and so I would encourage you to develop strong aspirations to meet qualified teachers and sages in order to help you along the way. We are truly blessed to live in a world where the teachings are available and people are gaining interest in their value, and we are truly fortunate to have so many noble beings and enlightened masters living in our world today. In short, practice being aware of your bodily sensations, your feelings, and the current instant of the world you are in where-ever you may be. Practice leaning into the awareness that recognizes and cognizes without identifying with what is recognized or cognized, and with consistent practice you will certainly see great benefits in your life. Dharma is vast and there are many teachings one can read about but it is most important to put them into practice and really reap their value. To contemplate them and to put them into your daily life and actions.
