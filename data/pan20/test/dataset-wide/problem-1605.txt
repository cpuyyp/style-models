I've reached out to FCKH8 asking for their sources for the figure, sadly, they haven't answered me yet (~ 2 weeks at the time of writing). The figures in different publications are around the 25% figure for women, and this figure is confirmed by studies. There are many sources citing the 1 in 4 statistic. It seems that the source for many of those claims is the survey Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey, published by the Department of Justice, which states in its abstract: 

The quote that is attributed to Dr. Louis Burkhalter was not said regarding the supposed findings of Larson Kohl, but on other findings, that didn't include skeletons or any other human (or other creature) remains at all: 

In addition to the reports by the media, the original interview is available and was translated by Memri Tv. The full transcript is: 

As to the lawfulness side of the matter, it depends on the person interpreting the law, if it's Prof. Eugene Volokh from the UCLA scool of law, then he would say: 

Yes (almost), in 2009 302 US active duty military deaths were due to suicide, and on the same year 149 US soldiers were killed in Iraq. According to a study of war-related deaths published by the Congressional Research Service in there were a total of 1515 active duty military deaths, of them 302 were self inflicted and 346 were as a result of hostile action. (Table 5, page 8). To get the number of casualties just in Iraq, according to icasualties.org there were 149 US deaths in Iraq in 2009, of those, 75 were non-hostile fatalities. 

No. We are talking here about 5-13 years old kids. The concepts that the source talks about are very sophisticated. When we are talking about little children, a level of simplification is needed. I studied (now finishing) a double degree in Physics, and Electrical Eng. and what I've seen is that even in undergraduate and graduate courses in the university, courses that are intended to Electrical or Software Engineers often simplify the physics involved ,to a degree that wouldn't be in physics courses, for better understanding of the general more important principal. For example, you don't need to learn quantum physics, only to know that an electron can only be in discrete levels in an atom. I'll touch on the 8 claims that you provide here. Some of the claims that the source makes are plain false. For example, the first and the "static charge" statements. Other statements that the source "falsifies" are right inside a solid materials, and others are right inside metal, since semiconductors, plasma, and Ion currents are quite complicated materials, and that children don't often get to see plasma streams or semiconductors, but most of them associate electricity only with electric wires and maybe simple electric instruments, like light bulbs switches and ovens it's safe to assume that when you talk about electricity to children, even if you don't state so explicitly, you are assuming current inside metal conductors. Lets look over the statements provided here, and see if they are right. My sources is what I was taught during my physics Bsc. For references you can see the book that was the course book when I studies the basics of Electricity and Magnetism, Electricity and Magnetism from Berkley, or you can watch the course filmed at MIT by Professor Walter Lewin. Some of the answer include some complex material from more advanced courses or subjects, at the end I'll give a list of the books which were the course books when I took those subjects. 

Wartickler's answer sums up why a sudden over night sex change can't happen. I want to address a possible explanation to the event. The only evince we have that the change has happened is that Than Sein's (the person in question) birth certificate states he was born a female. This can be easily attributed to him being an intersex1 person, as the article implies: 

Or in other words, Are wealth distribution graphs a good measure for wealth distribution inequality? Yes, they are wealth distribution graphs, show exactly what you want to look at when you talk about wealth distribution. If you want to know how much wealth does the X percent have, look at the graph. The graph also shows the "ideal" wealth distribution, which is taken from a peer reviewed article: $URL$ The graphs doesn't show that the bottom and second bottom 20% percentiles have the same amount of wealth, but very close amounts of wealth, where the second bottom has slightly more the the bottom. Beware, Here starts the ranty part of the answer. With all due respect to wealth inequality, it doesn't give a good picture of a person's status, because it doesn't translate the wealth into commodities or services. People don't need money to live, they need food, shelter, education, medical care, safety and so on. Wealth inequality however doesn't tell us if the people in the bottom have those things or not. For example, Uganda's wealth is more evenly distributed that the USA's, but where are the people of the lowest percentiles better off, in Uganda or the USA? You can see in the Wikipedia article on income inequality (which is sourced well, and organizes everything in a nice table with several different criterion to choose from) that countries like Ukraine, Belarus, Albania and Afghanistan all have more equal wealth distribution than the USA. The question that should be asked is where are people better off, not where are people more equal. Wealth distribution doesn't tell us if the poorest have food, shelter, medical care etc. and can't really tell us anything about the quality of life of the people. In other words, if the poorest people have food, housing, education medical care and opportunities in life, why should anyone care the the richest people are pooping in golden toilets? 

The University of California system indeed opened only one new campus since 1980, UC Merced, which started working in 2003-2004: 

TL;DR The timeline contradicts the biblical text As DJClayworth's answer notes, there is almost no conflict between the timeline presented and the current scientific understating of the creation of the Universe. However there is a great deal of conflict between the Bible and the presented timeline. The only reference that will be used here is the bible itself, I'll use the original Hebrew bible, for this reason I'll not quote the bible, but just put the number of the passage so that the reader could go to their preferred translation and read the passage for themselves. Also, I'll only look on the first chapter of Genesis. Although the second chapter also depicts the creation, it's contradictory to the first chapter, and the first chapter is the more famous of the two (the story with the 6 days of creation). There is plenty of material on-line about the contradiction from both sides, and I'll not touch on this issue. The first contradiction is the amount of data presented in the time line. The time-line includes anti-matter, quarks, photons and leptons, the 4 fundamental forces, atoms, nuclei, dimensions, galaxies and quasars, non of which is present in the biblical text. In order to put those things in the timeline, including the very precise times at which each of these events happens (the time scale of the bible is days, not 10 in the power of -45 seconds) you must have modern scientific knowledge that isn't found in the bible or in any other Judeo-Christian religious text. So while it doesn't contradict the bible on this issue it clearly uses non biblical sources, so the time line can't truly be called a religious time line. The timeline puts the creation of stars and galaxies before the creation of the solar system, and the creation of the moon after the creation of the Earth, and while it's not said so in the text timeline itself, in order to be on par with science it must put the creation of our sun before the creation of the Earth (see sources in DJClayworth's answer). However the bible puts the creation of the stars, Sun and Moon in the forth day (14-19) after the plants were created on the third day (9-13). And specificly the Moon and the Sun are described as being created on the 4th day in passage 16. The timlene puts the creation of the oceans and water circulation systems ( and ) on the first day after the creation of the moon and the ocean are created before the water circulation. The Bible puts the creation of the water circulation on the second day in the suppuration of the Water above the sky and the water below the sky and the creation of the sky (6-8) and the creation of oceans and seas in the third day by pooling the water into one place and exposing the land (9-10). Both happening in the wrong order and before the creation of the Sun, Moon and stars. Finaly, the timeline puts the creation of the living creatures (on the picture) as fallowing: 

Larson Kohl's Wikipedia page does state that he found human ancestral remains, but it was Australopithecus afarensis (the same species as the famous Lucy) but nothing about giants. The place described at the passage is Mumba Cave, which is located on the shore Lake Eyasi (not Elyasi) in Tanzania and was excavated by Kohl and his wife margit in the 1930s. The findings in the cave, by Kohl and his wife, and by later archaeologists are described in this Indiana University Article and it doesn't say anything even remotely close to giants. There are also published scientific articles regarding Mumba cave, none of them depicts giants. Google Scholar results for Mumba Cave 

This study however has a very small sample size (try to find a lot of HIV positive gay men that go to church), and should be taken with caution. This study shows that churchgoing doesn't affect blood pressure, and hypertension, but that prayer increases hypertension, and spirituality increases diastolic blood pressure. This study may contradict the article in some aspects, but it shows that religiosity can affect a persons physical status and health, which (in my opinion) is the main point of the article. 

Not sure what "Electricity is made of electrons, not protons?" means, because Electricity is a concept, not a real things, just like saying that gravity is made of mass, and relativity is made of light. If they mean that both protons and electrons can form electric current, then see previous answer. 

No, the North Korean didn't sink or even damage any US ship with torpedoes during the Korean War. As the question mentions, 4 ships sailed under the name "U.S.S Chicago", the Baltimore class heavy cruiser U.S.S Chicago (CA-136) (Wikipedia page)was out of commission during the Korean was. 

The mufti did play a role in WWII, and and he did try to stop deportation of Jews out of Romania and Bulgaria, at least one instance he was successful, and 4000 Jews were sent to Auschwitz instead. A Jerusalem Post article cite Dr. Efraim Zuroff from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Dr. Rafael Medoff, director of the David S. Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies in Washington: 

In his self published book Emerging Viruses: AIDS and Ebola: Nature, Accident, or Intentional? It's based on speculation and Numerology, non of which is a scientific proven theory. The specific numbers for the frequencies are derived by some strange and unexplained numerologic calculation: 

An aditional source about the sinking of the 5 ships. All of the other ships that were damaged by the North Korean were hit mostly by shore batteries, and a small minority from mines (see source). None of them was hit by a torpedo, or by any other means from a ship. 

The claim's source is unknown, but it's neither a police officer nor a self defence expert. More importantly, the hit ratio of a shooter depends on a wide variety of parameters, including the shooter's training, expertise and state of mind, the weapon they are holding, the position of the victim and other. In several high profile cases, however, shooters got better results than 4% hit rate. In the Virginia Tech Massacre the shooter fired at least 174 rounds and hit 47 people with at least three bullets each, rounding the number of fires shot up to 180, and taking the minimum of 3*47=141 bullets hits give us 78% hit rate. 

Vibrations within the hearing range or close to it might help humans heal (research in the area is not conclusive), but it's in different frequencies and with different illnesses, some examples: Whole-body vibration to treat low back pain: fact or fad? Acute exercise with whole-body vibration decreases wave reflection and leg arterial stiffness The effect of whole body vibration exposure on muscle function in children with cystic fibrosis: a pilot efficacy trial. Transmissibility of 15-hertz to 35-hertz vibrations to the human hip and lumbar spine: determining the physiologic feasibility of delivering low-level anabolic mechanical stimuli to skeletal regions at greatest risk of fracture because of osteoporosis. 

Yes, they are. There is the concept of positive charge flow, where the charge carriers are holes, however, at the micro level, it is still a flow of electrons, on the opposite side that creates a lack of electrons which "moves". However this is NOT intro level physics, but taught at solid state courses or semiconductors courses. Just to clarify, holes are positive charge carriers, however, holes are not a real particle, they are a representation of a lack of electrons. EDIT: after consulting a physics professor and doing some more research into this, I realize I was wrong here. Here is the fixed version: Protons are ionized hydrogen atoms, Ion conductance is present in Plasma, liquids, and can be present in some solids. But this isn't present in metals and wires, or any "classic" electrical appliance. since we assume that we are talking to a 13 years old kid, we don't talk about plasma, neurotransmitters, or semiconductors, so yes, inside a metal wire all electric current is due to the displacement of electrons.* 

Which means that 51% percent of the admissions are non white. Adding to it the Jewish number would mean that 34% of Harvard admissions are "European American".3 From the 2010 US census (wikipedia link) the percentage of the US population according to ethnicity is: 

I couldn't find any information on whether the Novotel hotels chain has Bibles in their hotels, if you have knowledge that they don't please comment it. The article doesn't say they are not stolen, it says that they are, but only by 1% of the guest 

Using of Epidurals and painkillers during childbirth was not shown to have long lasting effects on the baby1. It can affect the course of the birth, prolonging it and by slightly increasing chance for assisted or instrumental delivery, and, as some research suggest, that it may cause babies to have trouble “latching on” causing breastfeeding difficulties. According a review by Pub Med 

1 - Representation is calculated as: (% of students of certain ethnicity)/(% of US citizens of that ethnicity). 2 - I couldn't find the percentage of students in Harvard by ethnicity/race (other than for Jews), nor the admission numbers for Jews, so I'm using the numbers I have. Also the admissions document doesn't state if it's for undergrads only or for grad and undergrad programs. I assumed the former, as it makes the Jewish overrepresentation bigger. In case where we are talking only about undergrad programs, then the Jewish representation would fall to 545%, which is still the biggest representation, but it's significantly lower than the 704% figure. 3 - Jews come in all the colors of the rainbow and can be of different races, since they are not regarded as a separate race in the sources used, I had to chose what to take them from. Since most of the Jews are of European, Middle Eastern or North African (non black) descent, and since that would be the most generous interpretation of the claim (as it would reduce the number of "European American" and thus make their representation even smaller) I chose to deduct the number of Jews from the number of non Hispanic White in both the Harvard admission percentage and the US population percentage. 4 - Overrepresentation ration is calculated as: (representation % of Jews in Harvard)/(representation % of the other ethnicity in Harvard).
