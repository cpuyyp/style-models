There seem to be irregularities in the motion of the earth, so we add "leap seconds" to adjust our time accordingly. Since 1972 there have been 26 leap seconds I think. If we extrapolate that backwards 0.5 leap seconds per year, it would be 1 leap minute in 120 years and 5 leap minutes in 600 years. Would this be enough to throw off a prediction of an eclipse? In other words, could someone in 1416 predict an eclipse right now given the unpredictable errors caused by leap seconds? 

Atoms are formed by nuclei surrounded by electrons, bound by the electromagnetic force; nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons, bound by the strong nuclear force; protons and neutrons are in turn composed of (different types and amounts of) quarks, also bound by the strong force. At the very beginning of the universe it is theorized that all forces (those mentioned plus gravity and the weak nuclear force) were one; as the temperature dropped they started becoming distinct. Temperature, for particles, means energy. You cannot have atomic nuclei until quarks become bound as protons and nucleons and these in turn bound to each other, that is, you need the strong nuclear force to be distinct and overcome the tendency of energetic particles to just go away at random. Once the temperature drops, protons and neutrons form and then become bound in nuclei. Electrons are still scattered about, even though the electromagnetic force has become distinct as well, because they are still very energetic and they are hit all the time by other energetic particles, and the electromagnetic force is very, very weak compared to the strong nuclear force. At this stage the universe is a plasma, that is, a soup of nuclei and free electrons. (It still is, for the most part and excluding dark matter and dark energy, though that's not the case on our tiny corner of it, i. e. Earth.) Then the temperature drops some more and the electromagnetic force, which attracts positively-charged nuclei to negatively-charged electrons, begins to be felt. At this point "regular" atoms can form (and once the temperature is low enough, they can also bond to each other forming molecules). We can easily force nuclei and electrons to become detached again by using high temperature (or other forms of energy). It's rather more costly to dismantle nuclei (unless they are inherently unstable, i. e. radioactive, as in the case of uranium), and extremely difficult to dismantle protons or neutrons. 

The aspect of the universe described as "flat" is the spacetime curvature. In General Relativity gravity isn't treated as a force but as a curvature of the spacetime manifold. At large scales the universe is expanding: negative curvature like the top of a hill, where things roll downhill away from each other. But mass causes a positive curvature like a bowl, where things roll together, toward the bottom of the bowl. On average the two regimes of curvature appear to be balanced - i.e. the universe is, on average, flat. 

The rate of star formation in the universe peaked about 3.5 billion years after the Big Bang, or 2.7 billion years after it, according to a different studyâ€”in any case, for most of the universe's lifetime fewer and fewer stars have been forming each year. Though I don't have precise data on the death rate, on the whole the number of stars is decreasing as more old stars die than new ones form. Meanwhile, the light from old stars is being redshifted out of existence by the expansion of the universe, which is itself accelerating. I'm sure there's a mathematical model that can quantify this properly, but I think those two facts, combined, must be the answer to why the sky isn't getting brighter. 

The site to which you are referring is Sarmisegetusa in old Dacia, which was a well known royal citadel of the Illyrians in Roman times. Sarmisegetusa was a fortress, not an observatory. The reconstructed posts there were used to hold up ceilings and walls. Sarmisegetusa backs up against face of the mountain, so half of the horizon cannot even be seen from the site. That fact alone excludes the possibility that anyone was doing any astronomy there. 

I know that spectroscopy can be used to analyze the light of stars to determine the elements causing their emissions in the visible spectrum, but this requires knowing the emission spectra of the elements themselves. Is there a standard source for this data? 

The process whereby the Sun will become a red giant and then turn into a white dwarf is neither short nor simple. It's absolutely not the case that it will expand, blow away a chunk of its mass, contract again, and that will be it. According to Wikipedia (emphasis mine): 

I have managed to find two hypotheses for Uranus's tilt that explain why its moons are also orbiting on a tilted plane. The multiple impacts hypotheses lies on the fact that, if Uranus had become tilted by the force of a single large impact (as was commonly believed), then the moons should have stayed on their original plane. A corrected version of this hypothesis said that, if the accretion disc from which Uranus was forming was still around, an impact would have destroyed it and recreated it on the same place as the new equator. The moons would then have accreted from the disc on that plane. This, however, would have produced moons with retrograde motion (which is not the case for most). So the latest idea is that Uranus suffered multiple impacts, which, according to the simulations, works to produce the planetary system as we see it today. (There's another problem with this hypothesis.) The collision-free theory (or collissionless scenario as described in the paper) proposes that Uranus could have become tilted progressively as it formed without the need to postulate an impact (or series of impacts), if it had an additional satellite and started with a large inclination (which is allowed by current models); the extra moon could have been ejected later. The simulations worked for an initial inclination of more 17 degrees and a moon of 0.01 Uranian mass and at 50 Uranian radii. 

Let's say I'm floating in space with two toy tops. I spin them in opposite directions at the same speed. Each of them has angular momentum but the total angular momentum of the system is zero. On a larger scale the same thing could happen universe-wide. As stars and galaxies formed they would end up spinning every which way, but the total angular momentum would be unchanged. 

The term "superficial" means "on the surface," so "superficial gravity" is the same as surface gravity. As @pela pointed out in the comments, the author of the article is Portuguese and in that language the word for surface is 'superficie.' 

Aurorae are caused by energetic particles interacting with planetary atmospheres. Part of this flux comes from the Sun (solar wind) while the rest is cosmic radiation. My main question is: could a planetary body located far away from the Sun (or any other star), with a suitable atmosphere and magnetosphere, have noticeable* aurorae, just from being exposed to cosmic rays? A related question would be: do we know how much of the aurora is caused by the solar wind, and how much by cosmic rays? And thirdly: is there any other way that a planetary body could produce aurorae, such as its own electromagnetic emissions? *I know "noticeable" doesn't really work as a limit, but for the time being, I'm talking of electromagnetic radiation that can be distinguished clearly from the background of a planet's disc using instruments not more advanced than our current telescopes at interplanetary distances.
