Probably yes. Cinnabar has a very distinct brick-red colour, and some of your samples definitely have it. I'm not certain how much of this is actually cinnabar and how much is other stuff, but there is enough cinnabar in there to make it obvious just from the picture. IMPORTANT Cinnabar is toxic. It will release mercury metal on oxidation (that is, exposure to air), on exposure to water (so don't throw it in the river), and on exposure to strong light (that is, sunlight). On heating it will release mercury vapour. People die because of this. Go to the mine, and put it back in there, never taking it back. In case you do want to keep one of them, make sure it is clearly labelled as TOXIC and DANGEROUS and POISON in both English and Hungarian, and keep it away from children and pets.

No. It is not a meteorite at all. It is a terrestrial igneous rock, maybe a gabbro or something similar? Your density seems to be too low. 2 g/cm3 is extremely low for rocks and unlikely to be correct. 

Whether the "shale" is actually composed of clay minerals, or is it something else. You said it's what they took out from a coal mine, so it's probably crushed and milled. Assuming it is clay, there are some problems with that. As Fred said, clays expand and contract with water. Firing it solves the problem - it mineralogically changes the clays to other minerals that do not possess that characteristic. Now, there are clays and there are clays. Some can take in a lot of water (such as smectite) while others don't (illite). 

Yes, they are. It's not the sills or dykes that "jump", it's the magma. Depending on the various parameters such as viscosity, stress, temperature, pressure, and local conditions and availability of joints, the magma will flow either as a sill or a dyke (or some other intrusive body). Notice that your two sketches are basically the same thing - it's just the in one case the sill is the dominant structure whereas the dyke is more dominant in the second sketch. The flow regime can definitely change from a "dyke" to a "sill" and vice versa. Here's a schematic diagram: (source: USGS) I also had a quick Internet search and came up with this great example from nature: 

They are perfectly rounded. This rarely happens naturally. They are completely empty. The actual rock is to the left of that image. Most of the area covered in your image does not seem to have any real rock in it, unless it is glassy but I doubt it because there is rock on the left. That 4-sided halo around it occurs almost entirely in artificial bubbles created during the sample preparation process. You can put it a λ plate and see that opposite sides have similar colours (either red or blue). 

HFSE and LILE The incompatible elements are then subdivided into two groups: the high field strength elements (HFS or HFSE) and the large ion lithophile elements (LIL or LILE). The LIL name partly gives away why they are called like that: the LIL are indeed larger than other cations. They are lithophile in the sense that they are incompatible and usually end up enriched in the crust (also lithosphere). The HFS are also enriched in the crust (eventually) but their name derives from their small radius compared to their high cationic charge: the z/r ratio. As a result, their bonding to nearby anions is very strong, that is - they have a high electrical field strength. The subdivision between the two groups has been defined at z/r = 2.0, but as this is a continuous value, no strict theoretical definition of where the boundary lies can be given. Historically, the REE have been considered as LIL. In more modern times, the REE may be excluded when discussing HFS. Why do we need the two groups? Even though both the LILE and HFSE behave in an incompatible way during mantle melting, their response to post-magmatic processes differ. The HFSE are usually immobile: that is, they are mostly resistant to metamorphism and hydrothermal alteration. On the other hand, the LILE are fluid-mobile and hydrothermal alteration may change their contents in the studied rock. Fresh rocks are a scarce luxury and many rocks that we study have experienced some kind of alteration. Because HFSE are resistant to these processes, their contents are likely to be representative of the original rock. This is extremely important: it is possible to look at a rock beyond the altered mineral composition and the modified major element contents. The LIL can teach us the opposite - we can learn about the alteration processes. If we do find fresh rocks and we find anomalies in the LIL systematics, we can learn about hydrothermal processes that occurred in the mantle that would otherwise not be able to see. What about hexavalent cations? One would think that hexavalent cations such as Mo6+, Cr6+, V6+ and U6+ should also appear in the figure as cations with an even more HFS character. However, when in the hexavalent state they form anionic complexes and do not behave like the cations in the figure.

(Fig. 4 of Anenburg et al. 2014) You can see the blue celestine (strontium sulfate) in the bottom, and the white calcite (calcium carbonate) on top. Their interface is colored red and salmon pink. The reason is the existence of tiny micrometer sized inclusions of iron oxides (i.e. rust). Note that the iron oxides are different minerals, e.g. hematite, goethite, etc. Mineral inclusions can sometimes cause even more spectacular effects, such as asterism: 

I would add that this could also be plenty of other more exotic things I haven't thought about. May be beneficial to take it to a local mineral club, geologist, geological university department and ask them. They might be familiar with the local geology and give you a positive identification. 

118 elements have been discovered. Many of them are not stable for more than a fraction of a second, are highly radioactive, and are completely useless. Tc, Pm, most of the actinides and post-actinides. Many elements are mined together with other elements, and not on their own. Cd and In are by products of Zn. La, Ce, Pr and Nd are usually mined together. Same for Ti and V. You don't need a mine for each and every one. Some elements are kind of useless. Rb. Hardly any uses for it. S is a by product of Cu mining, and there's no use for so much. When you mine Pr and Nd, you end up with lots of (almost) worthless La and Ce. What about Th? Hardly any market for it. 

You can think of it as the "reverse" of moonshine. When you walk outside at night and there's a full moon, you can actually see quite a lot around you. Same thing - this happens on the moon when there's a "full earth" that lights up everything around. And since you're on earth, you see this from the outside, on the moon. 

You have a rock called conglomerate. This rock is basically a bunch of other rock fragments that were transported in some kind of stream or river, became rounded, and then got buried under other layers of sediment. This burial caused the individual pieces of rock to stick together to form one hard rock. A quick look at a geological map of South Dakota shows that the area you described has limestone, sandstone, shale, and other similar sedimentary rocks. Looking at your picture - this seems very reasonable. I have a strong feeling that the white pieces are limestone, the yellow pieces are sandstone, and they grey stuff is some kind of hardened clay that cements everything together. To confirm this, do the following: 

...because that's exactly where you find sedimentary rocks. In contrast, the deep ocean basins are igneous rocks (mostly basalts) overlain by thin marine sediments with very little organic material. Whatever organic material is there, it never has the chance for maturation. It's either very cold, or gets heated in subduction and is lost forever in the deep mantle. 

There are some subtleties that I'd like to add, in addition to Mark's answer. When talking about the hardness of a mineral, the nature of the chemical bonds in the crystal structure (e.g. covalent vs ionic) are not the only important thing. Crystal morphology is also important. For example, Si-O-Si and Al-O-Al bonds usually cause minerals to be hard, such as in the case of quartz and feldspar. However, if you look at clays and other related minerals, they also have similar bonds. In this case, however, crystal morphology is the determining factor. Clays are not one big crystal, but an aggregate of many micron-sized crystals. The hardness is not determined by formation of crystal lattice defects and dislocations as in Mark's explanation, but rather by movement of individual crystals. Assuming you could have had a single huge clay crystal, it would be much harder than the common lump of clay. Also, take for example graphite. One of the reasons for its softness is the fact that each carbon ring (see link for refresher) slides on top of another, and not any change in the actual bonds of the carbon atoms. Calcite is another example. With a Mohs hardness of 3, you are not supposed to be able to scratch it with your fingernail. However, chalk is a calcite bearing rock sometimes defined as a "limestone you can scratch with your fingernails". The case here is similar, individual clay-sized grains of calcite are moving around. Another point is that the Mohs' scale is sometimes too idealistic. Take for example feldspar, that has a Mohs hardness of 6. This is for a perfect crystal. However, often feldspar crystals are slightly altered to said clays, thus reducing the hardness. An additional interesting point is that per crystal, hardness is not always a constant. Take for example the mineral kyanite. It has a hardness of 4 in one direction and 6 to 7 in another direction. 

All of these water mass fluxes are orders of magnitude larger than the amount of water carried to the international space station. It's like asking whether you can deplete a beach from sand by taking single sand grains out of it, when you're gaining and lose huge amounts of sand by ocean wave action. 

These mountains exist because of the plate movement. Divergent plate boundaries cause rifting, and the geomorphological expression of a rift is a valley. Valleys are, by definition, surrounded by mountains. The mountains that you see in the photographs could not have been there if there hasn't been a divergent boundary. 

You mean mohawkite. Unlikely. Mohawkite is found only in one mine in the far north of Michigan (Keweenaw). Unless someone took it from there and dropped it somewhere in the south and it was picked up by the river, it's probably not. 

This is exactly the reason it exists. Masada wasn't a holiday town for the rich, and people didn't think of it as a particularly good place to live. Even the nearby modern town of Arad is considered as a very remote and unwelcoming place to live in by most Israelis. Masada was a place where outcasts, outlaws and rebels lived. The people living there during the famous Roman siege were not the mainstream Jews living in most of Judea at that time. They were considered outlaws even by the Jewish administration in Jerusalem and elsewhere. The dryness and remoteness of the area was an asset: no one even wanted to hunt them down over there. That is, unless you get someone really pissed off (such as the Roman Empire) and they decide to end it in the famous siege. The dryness was also helping the defenders: they had access to the water reservoirs while the attackers did not.
