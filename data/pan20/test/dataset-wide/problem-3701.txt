Let $k$ be a field with algebraic closure $\bar k$. Assume that $k$ is perfect and not of characteristic $2$ for simplicity. Let $$X: \quad Q(x)=0, \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^n_k,$$ be a non-singular quadric hypersurface over $k$. Then it is well-known that $X\times_k \bar k$ is birational to some projective space, with the birational map given by stereographic projection. My question is whether some analogue of this holds over $k$. Namely 

This latter argument does not work however for cubic threefolds, as for a cubic threefold, the hyperplane section is half the anticanonical divisor. So the question is whether the anticanonical divisor is always divisible by $2$ in the Picard group of $X$. Note that the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence yields the exact sequence $$0 \to \mathrm{Pic}(X) \to \mathrm{Pic}(X_\bar{k})^{\mathrm{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)}=\mathbb{Z} \to \mathrm{Br}(k),$$ so the obstruction to $X$ being isomorphic to a cubic threefold over $k$ is given by an element of $\mathrm{Br}(k)[2]$. 

Let $K$ be a field and let $Q$ be a quaternion algebra over $K$. Then it is well-known that the class $[Q]$ of $Q$ in $Br(K)$ has order $2$. One can show this by constructing an explicit isomorphism $Q \otimes_K Q \cong M_2(K)$. My question is about the converse. 

It should be quite possible to obtain an asymptotic formula for this using standard lattice point counting and sieve techniques. First consider the following simpler problem: Let $p$ be a prime and let $r_p \in \mathbb{F}_p$. Then the collection of $a_i$ for which the associated polynomial $f(x) = a_n x^n + \cdots + a_0$ has a root at $r_p$ modulo $p$ is a sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^{n+1}$. Hence one can count this number quite easily using standard lattice point counting techniques. In your case, one would obtain various collections lattices given by the different choices of $r_p$ modulo $p$ for different primes. One can count the points in these lattices as above, but one would also need to combine this with an inclusion-exclusion argument to take care of possible double counting (e.g. you need to be careful that you don't count those polynomials which have a root at both $0$ and $1$ modulo $p$ twice). This gives an asymptotic formula for your problem of the shape $$\#A_{\mathcal{P},n} \sim c_{\mathcal{P},n}N^{n+1}, \quad c_{\mathcal{P},n} > 0.$$ You would need to write out the details carefully if you would like to know the exact form of the leading constant. 

By an arithmetic scheme I mean a finite type flat regular integral scheme over $\mathrm{Spec} \, \mathbb{Z}$. 

I work over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero. Recall that a flag variety is a projective variety which is a homogeneous space for some semisimple algebraic group. Every flag variety is of the form $G/P$, where $G$ is a semisimple algebraic group and $P$ is a parabolic subgroup. It seems to me that this data is "discrete", so I expect flag varieties to have discrete moduli. Moreover flag varieties are Fano varieties, and it is known that there are only finitely many deformation types of Fano varieties of fixed dimension. This leads to my question. 

If you use a mac, BibDesk is fantastic: among other really nice features, it lets you find your book/article/etc on your choice of free sites (ACM, arXiv, CiteULike, Google Scholar, HubMed, SPIRES) or subscription sites (IEEE Xplore, MathSciNet, Project Euclid, Zentralblatt Math) and then once you've found the item, it takes one click to import the citation into the database. The database can also store electronic copies of articles (if available) referenced to the citation. So for example, I would open BibDesk, click on the icon that says Web, click on "MathSciNet". Within the program I see the MathSciNet page (assuming I'm at work where I have access). Type in the search terms Hartshorne and Geometry, and up comes 8 citations I could import. One of them is Algebraic Geometry from 1977, so I would click on the button that says "import". BibDesk does all the other work. While writing a paper, just drag and drop the citations onto your LaTeX document to embed \cite{blah} with the appropriate cite key (at least if you're using TeXShop). When you're ready to stick a bibliography into your paper, select the relevant articles in the BibDesk database and export them into a BibTeX file. It's super easy. 

Aside from the Desargues graph, are there nice (at least vertex-transitive), small (say, less than 60 vertices), cubic, bipartite graphs with girth at least 6 and no 8-cycles? (or, even better, no cycles of length congruent to 0 mod 4.) Bonus: any idea how to use Mathematica to pull these out of its list of graphs it's got data for in Mathematica 7? 

There seems to be some disagreement about what precisely the definition of an affine transformation is. For example, Martin, in his transformation geometry book, proves that an affine transformation is a map which takes any three noncollinear points to any other three noncollinear points (this is sometimes called the fundamental theorem of affine geometry). In particular, this means that every affine transformation may be represented as the composition of an invertible linear transformation and a translation. On the other hand, some references simply define an affine transformation as the composition of a linear transformation and a translation, in which case the transformation need not be invertible. (I'm not familiar with the second reference; it was just handy on a Google Books search on Affine transformations.) 

If you are willing to relax the trivalency requirement (and not require convexity, which was not one of the stated constraints), you can make all sorts of polyhedra, using only regular pentagons and hexagons, which have all sorts of symmetry. For example, start with two truncated icosahedra, and remove one hexagon from each of them. Now you can glue them together along the removed hexagons (matching up pentagonal and hexagonal faces), forming a new polyhedron with 3 and 4-valent vertices and considerably less symmetry than what you started with. Continuing, you could make long rod-shaped polyhedra, or you could make some spiky polyhedron by replacing multiple hexagons with other truncated icosahedra. 

This is definitely not true; just consider two smooth cubic threefolds in $\mathbb{P}^4$. Of course many other examples exist, e.g. Fano hypersurfaces in projective space which are not quadrics nor cubic surfaces (here the Picard group is generated by the hyperplane class by the Lefschetz hyperplane section theorem). Also many classes of Fano threefolds of Picard number one. If what you wanted was true, most of the interesting moduli spaces for Fano varieties would in fact be trivial. 

Although of course Kostya's answer is a good definitive one, I thought best to mention that there are tools available other than spectral sequences depending on exactly what you want. For example, if $M$ is an orientable surface, $G$ is finite, the action is not neccessarly free and the quotient is still smooth, then you can use the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. There are also higher dimensional analogues of this which give you information about the canonical bundle of $M$ if $M$ is a complex manifold. 

Let $X$ and $Y$ be regular integral Noetherian schemes. Assume that $X$ and $Y$ are smooth and proper over a base scheme $S=Spec R$, where $R$ is a discrete valuation ring. If $X$ and $Y$ have isomorphic generic fibres, is it also the case that their special fibres are isomorphic? Remarks: 

Of course the point of this question is whether $d$ can be chosen uniformly with respect to the family. As a brief remark, it is quite easy to prove this when $B={\mbox{Spec}}\ \mathbb{C}$. Indeed, by assumption the algebraic classes form a subgroup of finite index inside the Hodge classes! I am also similarly interested in the analogous question for the integral Tate conjecture for families of varieties over number fields and finite fields. 

Let $$X: \quad Q_1(x)=Q_2(x) = 0 \quad \subset \mathbb{P}^{2n+1},$$ be a smooth complete intersection of two quadrics of odd dimension over a field $k$, not of characteristic $2$. Let $J(X)$ denote the intermediate Jacobian of $X$. When $k$ is algebraically closed, I know that $J(X)$ is isomorphic to the Jacobian of the hyperelliptic curve $$y^2 = \mathrm{det}(xQ_1 + Q_2). \quad (*)$$ 

Recall that a flag variety over a field $k$ is a smooth projective variety over $k$, which is a homogeneous space for some linear algebraic group. My question concerns specialisations of flag varieties over discrete valuation rings. Namely, let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring with field of fractions $K$ and residue field $k$. Assume for simplicity that $K$ and $k$ are algebraically closed. 

Remarks: Let $j:U \to X$ be the open subset given by removing the fibres of $X \to \mathrm{Spec} \, \mathbb{Z}$ lying above those primes dividing $n$.
