The effect of having a single coin is that quantities of it will have to be used for any transaction, no matter how large or small. This then has the effect that if it is a high-value coin, how do you use it to buy a low-value item? If it is a low-value coin, how do you carry enough of them to buy a high-value item? The reason for multiple denominations of currency is to have the best of both worlds, i.e. high granularity (the ability to have small differences in the prices of items) and high portability (the ability to carry a lot of funds easily). In metallist economies where the value of a coin is tied to the value of the metal it is made from, where a coin of sufficiently low denomination for everyday transactions was not available from the official mint, coin of lower value was frequently manufactured by clipping the existing coins - cutting them in half, quarters or even eighths. The reason for having fewer denominations is that there is a setup cost involved to the state in having coins minted (making the dies), which increases as more denominations are produced. This may not matter much to some governments, but may be a matter of some importance to others. 

Many plants use day length to time the cycles of their lives; experiments have been done altering these cycles, and a common consequence is that many species of plants die if exposed to unusual photoperiodicity over a long period. Also, there would be more severe temperature swings, which would place plants under severe thermal stress that could also be lethal. So, we'd have a world where most of the plants would be dying or dead, a recipe for mass extinction if ever I saw one. I hardly need consider what the temperature extremes would do to animals. 

Tethered hot air balloons could be effective in increasing the observation range for military purposes. However, on land, weather conditions that do not always allow a balloon to fly would mean that any fair-weather gains in observational distance would be negated by the necessity to plan for poor weather. On the other hand, in fair weather, a hot air balloon could greatly increase the observation range of a ship in good weather, but would also make that ship observable from a greater range too. However, a balloon may cause a ship to heel over a lot due to the force it could exert at the top of a mast, and if anchored to the deck, the cable securing it would be prone to foul with the ship's rigging. Additionally, requiring a fire on board a wooden ship to launch a balloon would make most captains quite nervous. This would make balloons only of much use in ideal military situations. 

The flail has the advantage of being able to wrap around shields for whatever they're worth, which might be of use if they're super-thick and wielded by another super-strong individual. You've got the strength to give that mass some momentum, so make the most of it. You don't need finesse against a regular opponent, just smash their defences, and then their bodies. Sure, that's a lot of mass to get moving (and stop), and giving yourself some ballast in the form of heavy armour - and more traction in the form of spiked soles on your boots - is just what is called for to deal with the problems of inertia. You're strong enough to carry it, after all. Missile Weapons A bow allows you to translate your super-strength into speed. While you can't fire more arrows per minute than the next man, you can shoot heavier arrows from a more powerful bow over a greater distance. You could carry a bow as powerful as a small ballista, and punch arrows clear through a thick shield that is bristling with the arrows of lesser men, as well as the plate armour of the merely mortal man wielding it. Drawbacks You might not want to try this at sea. All that armour would make you sink like a stone if you went into the water. At sea, instead of armour you might want a big wooden shield like a Roman tower shield that you could drop if you found yourself in the drink, and a heavy axe could be used to cut masts, spars, rigging and men with equal facility. There's still no substitute for a bow, though. 

Actually, it has been suggested that complex, multicellular life could evolve to float in the atmosphere of a gas giant. From single cells floating in hospitable bands of the atmosphere, we could reasonably expect to go from those to multicellular organisms capable of moving about under their own power. As to whether such life could leave the atmosphere... This is a very complex question. It would be necessary to construct infrastructure that could float in the habitable bands of the atmosphere - anything too heavy could drop down out of reach, and anything too light could float up out of reach. However, if the materials were available, it may be possible for beings in these conditions to explore both upwards and downwards, and potentially even leave the atmosphere entirely. 

Rods, while numerous, are interconnected so that receiving a photon on any one is perceptually indistinguishable from receiving a photon on any other in its group, increasing sensitivity at the cost of resolution. Without knowing how interconnected the predatory animal's rod cells are, or whether it has structures such as a tapetum lucidum, we cannot say if this animal's night vision is better, equivalent or worse than humans, who have approximately the same numbers of rod cells. Cones are typically not interconnected, so that stimulation of each cone results in perception of a smaller point of light. Having far more cone cells than human eyes would mean that colour vision had significantly higher resolution than human eyes, quite possibly over a wider field of view than human eyes. Such an animal would likely not have a fovea, but would have vision of equal acuity across its entire field of view. However such visual acuity would not be without cost. The optic nerves would be especially thick, reducing the potential for movement of the eyes within their sockets, though some animals such as owls already have such a limitation. In addition, the processing requirements for such a large number of cones in the retina would mean that the animal's brain's visual cortex would necessarily be greatly enlarged. This would come at the cost of either less brain volume being available for other mental functions, making the animal more stupid and/or dextrous than other species with similar-sized brains, or at the cost of having a larger brain, and thus having a higher basal metabolism and a greater nutritional requirement for the proteins and lipids necessary for growing such a large brain.
