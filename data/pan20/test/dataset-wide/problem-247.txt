I've just discovered this, so apologies for such a long delay! So, some thoughts: 1) information has to be encoded in something (e.g. spirit matter, energy patterns etc.) and its degradation would be, almost by definition, entropy. 2) Hence, would people try to limit the entropy as much as possible, once they worked out that the universe worked in this way? perhaps by encoding a specific memory in multiple ways (so at least one way would survive the trip back). Think, for example, of Thomas Edison's experiments to contact the dead, and Spiritualism as a whole, and some of the Buddhist meditation practices which are about surviving aspects of the afterlife , and so forth. In essence, people will attempt to 'hack' the system and seek a way around the problem. If at any point in time, the physics of 'energy patterns/spirit matter/whatever mechanism' are deduced, then a technology may be derived to minimise entropy, or force some edge-case in the physics which would allow a breaking of the rule... Perhaps. 3) Maybe I missed it in what you said, but if people can come back at any time, can they not come back at a time prior to their forgetting too much? Can they come back as their own re-incarnation, thereby immortalising themselves within a time loop? Could the go back to their living self, and retrieve what they have lost from their living former self? And then keep replenishing their memories? As for effects on religion: 1) prophecy would be big - and done right, more reliable; here's how my religion would do it: A) Supply a message you want to send to the past to a lot of people. B) Kill them all. C) They report to your former selves, but although entropy means they've lost information, they've probably not all lost the same information in the same manner, so each will have a small piece of the message. D) Apply statistical methods to put the fragments together and get some idea of the future. 2) Deceit via prophecy can be done in the same way - just get you're murdered population of death-travellers to tell lies (or lie to them all)... 3) What about temporal edge cases? Can you die/come back at the very edges of Time itself? The start or end of the universe? If you could retrieve any information from such times, you'd have clear stories about how the universe starts and ends. 4) There'll be stories in the myths of people from the 'future' meeting the heroes of the stories. Perhaps advising them etc. 5) Mostly, however, I'm not sure religion will be that different, because it already claims all these things. The only difference may be if there was a scientific means of demonstrating, verifiably, that the universe works this way... And given that we already live in a world where there are consistencies in the stories of people who have Near Death Experiences, where stories (cases) of supposed re-incarnation exists, prophecies etc.. I suspect it'll have the same scepticism we have now, which is kinda interesting, I think... 6) I think it all hinges on getting accurate, concrete factual information out of the dead/re-incarnated by some means. If that can be done, and repeatedly, then there's the scientifically verifiable proof one needs to turn religion into science and fact. Deceit aside, no more doubts about the afterlife, or the origins and end of the universe. Scientists will look for ways to exploit this for time travel, space travel etc. Governments and anyone with resources will try to gain prophecy as a means of power. Religion will die, and be replaced by the Science of the Hereafter. So my answer would be this: If no reliable information can be garnered, it'll be identical to what we have now. Otherwise... huge differences, but religion will be dead,replaced by a fascinating new science. Science if what you get when you put religion and magic under the microscope - Consider Newton - he spent more time searching for secret messages in the bible than formulating physics as we now know it. He studied alchemy. All this was because in his time, there wasn't a distinction between magic and science - science was born of magic once you worked out what the rules of the universe really were, and Newton etc. were merely trying to understand how the universe worked (by seeking underlying rules to phenomenon, such as reactions in alchemy, or 'magical' processes, and finding them wanting or verifying an effect which could be studied). Hope that helps! 

If your doing an alternate history, I would say you could change the whole context by changing the one simple fact of the Atlantic exchange that decimated the native civilizations of the America's. Without most of the natives being wiped out by disease the whole of the "conquest" would of been something much different then it turned out. My thinking is that not only would nations be possible, they would be likely and what the Europeans would be dealing with rather then the isolated groups of survivors that made the Americas a relatively easy conquest. It would resemble something more like our western relations with China and the east in the sense that the west while practicing varying degrees of influence over the area never really conquered them. The civilizations of the Americas would of continued to emerge. Maybe at an accelerated rate with an Atlantic exchange that resulted in an exchange of ideals and technology, rather then death by disease. just a thought. 

unfortunately, there will always be insurance salesman and adjusters to make sure your wasting your money. 

I have a town in mind that could be a great candidate for this total destruction that would go unnoticed for a week. I lived in this town so like the aliens I have studied it and think it is a good town to destroy for a base. But a bit of a paradox comes up. Why would they take over a town? What benefit does a destroyed town have for them over a isolated spot? It does not seem they benefit from taking over a city. A town or city seems to have a higher risk of discovery then an uninhabited spot, just a thought. The town I have in mind is Ely Nevada. The link is to search result of Ely. Ely is a small isolated town, with a small population of about 5000 people. It is a town at high altitude, 6400 feet. The town is at the intersection of two highways, NV 93 and Highway 50. In all directions it is 80 to 160 miles to the next gas. It is over two hundred miles to the nearest Walmart. If the aliens need super low priced shopping the are out of luck. Ely has very little trade. It has a mine that truckloads of ore are moved out of daily. Businesses that have deliveries like a super market, McDonalds and of course package type stuff like postal. It also has an Internet trunk line (backbone) routed through town. The roads have very little traffic, I would speculate hundreds of cars and trucks each day, not much more. Tourist trade is light, mostly hunters in season and people just passing through on their way to someplace else. There is only one scheduled flight in each day, which is often cancelled because no one is flying in. (Ely airport has the highest per passenger flight subsidy in the nation, over $3000 per passenger.) A weather event like a snow storm would bring traffic coming in and out of town to a standstill. Add as a consequence of that event a power outage, that puts cell phone service down and knocks out the internet and you have enough diversion to keep outside suspicion down to a very reasonable level. Outsiders might get suspicious, but it is not likely that suspicion would gain enough momentum for investigation to verify something is wrong within your time frame of 48 hours. The people that might be the people that raise the invasion by aliens flag, would be the crews coming to repair the lines, and clear the roads, would put off coming until the storm mostly passed. In Ely the highway station that keeps all the snow plows is located in Ely, so not much out side help would be coming in. Same is true for power. Nobody will be coming in force from the outside. There is no chance of someone getting out on foot, it is simply too far to the next town. Even a motorized escape by land would be difficult. A snow mobile would not have the hundred plus mile range needed to get to the next town, and since the next town in all directions is at least two thousand feet lower, it is likely they will run out of snow to trek even if they had range. Most other vehicles would have a difficult time getting out cross country. At any rate the trip cross country in snow would be very long, twelve hours more or less. Word might get out from a ham radio hobbyist with a generator. Even if the Aliens were discovered in a matter of hours, it would still be a matter of days before anything but an airstrike could be mounted to remove the aliens. It would be a good bet that the Aliens would be able to defend against any kind of conventional air attack. All the major airbases, Nellis at Las Vegas, Indian Springs, and Hill AFB near Salt lake, are hundreds of miles away. Even an emergency air response would take awhile. Ground response, the army would take days if not weeks to mount and deploy to the area. Even modern armies do not move at highway speeds. The army would be very exposed on the long highways they would be coming in on, making attacking the convoys easy for the aliens. Aliens could take and hold Ely easily. Aliens would have plenty of time to mount a defensive posture before any kind of force could be bought to bare. 

For the purposes of this question, lets assume that we are in Edwin Abbott Abbott's Flatland, but the world is a disk, with living shapes Above, and 'dead' shapes Below (the underside of the disk). However, time runs in the opposite direction Below, so if A. Square died on Monday, and went Below (let's assume there a 'strip of paper', like a passage, which he traverses to go from the top of the circular plane, to the underside), and was dead for five days, but was then allowed to return the the world of the living, he would arrive the Wednesday before he died. I'm assuming that time is linear (no parallel universes), and that Cause and Effect operate, but not necessarily in that order. So, for example, A. Square might be able to warn his former living self of his impending death, but would do so knowing it will happen anyway (otherwise his ghost would not be there to give the warning in the first place). The other assumption is that events unobserved by anyone are indeterminate (i.e. a kind of Copenhagen interpretation of time). Can anyone see any logical issues with this? One concern is the travel via the 'strip of paper' connecting the top (Above) world with the Below world - would there be a point where A Square's ghost would be existing both in forward time, and backward time? Could this be done non fatally? incidentally, time Below doesn't involve people walking backwards, and broken glasses reforming; locally, it appears as if time is moving forward, just backwards relative to those Above. I've thought of one issue concerning computation: Imagine a machine which prints either the letter 'A' or 'B'. However, it is rigged to send this printout to its former self, and when the former self receives that printout, it is programmed to choose the opposite. So if it chooses 'A' it tells it's former self this, so it chooses'B', and visa versa. I'd imagine that such a weird 'paradox engine' would be in a suppositional state, like Schroedinger's cat in the box, until some highly improbable failure occurred to break it out of its loop (such as mechanical failure etc.) Would this mean there is a 'virtual' universe where the machine runs thousands of times before the improbable event occurs? I suspect this would mean our universe would occasionally have very improbable things happen due to such temporal feedback loops occurring in nature... The motivation for this is a fantasy story, where I'm trying to devise a mechanism for prophecy based on (as in much folklore) the notion of time working differently in 'fairyland'. 

Interplanetary empire in Sci-Fi seems to always be based on some sort of warp speed for good reason, there are few reasons to have an empire except to exploit others for the riches that can profitably be brought home. The technological limits of light speed would make empire consisting of other worlds across the vast distances of space simply impossible. A conquered Empire like the Roman Empire would be quite impossible to hold together by threat of force. However a settled Empire like the English Empire could have some sustainability much like the modern day Commonwealth. To be sure there would be a couple of pesky colonists like The Americans that much could not be done about if they were determined to be completely independent and hell bent on some set of principles that called for total self independence. If the colony was on a planet were there were indigenous people the colonist might hold some control for awhile like the Spaniards in America or the English in Asia, but that would end just like it did for the Spaniards in most places, with the original empire with little influence and much hostility. About all the Empire could do was cut them off from communication of new technology. There would be very few reasons for the Empire to even exist. The exchange would be limited to data and to a friendly port in the wilderness of space for the occasional space traveler. Even if there was an outside threat such as Borg or a competing Empire mutual defense would be minimal, consisting of the colonies being hostile cannon fodder that would slow down an enemy advance. No one is coming from the home world soon enough to save anything. 

Retirement at the end of a long life like we know it now is simply not going to happen for most people that live 4-500 years. The genetic clock running out is not likely to be the cause of death for most people. Untimely deaths due to accidents and disease will kill many more people then old age. Planning for retirement may very well be considered an exercise in futility for most people. It is extremely difficult to come up with a number for people that die accidentally. About 250,000 of 2.4 millions of Americans who die, die accidentally each year. Of everyone who dies in a developed country, 7 out of ten of those deaths are people over the age of 70. With that in mind we can say that accidents and disease account for about 30% of the death rate each year, or about 800,000 people die of the 300,000,000 in the US. If your multiply the one third of a percent that dies of unnatural causes each year you have roughly 3% of a population dead every decade, about 30% every century who die from accidents and disease. We could lower that figure by removing a lot of deaths that occur from heart attack, making an assumption that we would not tend to drop dead from heart attack so much because at fifty we would have the hearts of twenty year olds. And perhaps when you add war into the equation the rate might go up. If you consider super bugs that are making antibiotics less effective, then the figure might go up to plague like stats in some years. Over the course of 500 years a lot of things can happen that make it the exception to live to be a 500 year old. This kind of begs the question, at what age does social security kick in? Anyway back to retirement, you would not retire. At some point in your life you might become disabled, unable to work and there would be some program to take care of you. For most people, depending on how mundane the job is, short retirements more akin to sabbaticals would be the norm. You might take a couple of years off to play. You may after fifty years in a job decide to change careers and go back to school for a decade then get a new job. You might sell a business and be able to cruise for a couple of decades, dabbling in shuffle board and basket weaving until the money ran out. You may just have a very good time with your career and never do much besides vacations.
