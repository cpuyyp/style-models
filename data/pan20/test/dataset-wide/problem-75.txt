Writing is nothing more than forming characters on a substance. Ink pens work above the water because the ink can dry; not something that's possible in the deep blue sea. However, there is another writing implement that works just as well in the water as out: pencils. Early writing Carved rocks are no different above the water than below it; get something sharp and get carving. It takes a while, but it works just fine. Later writing Pencils, or indeed any soluble substance that can be smeared on another surface (like clay or lead) will work just fine. Writing surfaces will likely be flat rocks, shells, or bones - anything with a broad, rough surface. Printing Printing is a little more difficult; water-soluble ink is simple to make, store, and distribute. Instead, the mer-creatures will need to invent either a non-water-based ink; oil-based is likely the easiest. Once you have an ink, the rest is easy. And, once you have an oil-based ink, you can make ball-point pens. 

Simple time delay If the target takes medication, preferably hard capsules, it makes it really easy. Pick any number (or combination) of fast-acting (or slow, I suppose) poisons, fill a capsule, and place it in their medications/vitamins. Hard capsules will take a few minutes to several hours to digest, and can be made fairly precisely. Replacing the contents of capsules was used in 1982 to carry out the Chicago Tylenol murders. Long-term ingestion In small enough quantities, poisons are undetectable by taste or smell. Toxic metals have the ability to bioaccumulate, or build up in the body; lead and mercury are well known, but there are any number of toxic metals. Unlike some poisons, since metals are elements, they can't be destroyed, which means that they can be delivered through smoke (poisoned tobacco or candles), food, liquid, chairs, even soap - anything the victim comes in contact with. Unfortunately (for the poisoner, at least), most symptoms of metal toxicity are recognizable and often treatable before death, meaning that unless you use a really big dose, chances are, your victim is going to live to make it to the hospital. The best option would be to slowly administer small amounts over the period of a few months or weeks, waiting for you victim to begin exhibiting symptoms; early symptoms are usually ignored, but if you know what you're looking for, you can spot them easily. Once the first symptoms occur, follow up with a moderate dose. The larger dose, coupled with the built-up smaller doses, will surely kill your target. Radiation Poisons are useful because they are cheap, easy to procure, easy to administer, and at least some of them are hard to trace. However, certain particles are deadly in doses as small as a few atoms - radioactive materials. While some radioactive materials take hours or days to kill someone, once ingested, if you really want to be sure of death, use some polonium. Polonium may be hard to come by, but it is effective. With a large enough dose, death would occur within seconds. Followed by the deaths of everyone in the house, block, and possibly city. I would suggest wrapping the dose in a lead sheath and placing that in a capsule. And hire someone else to administer it. Death by Boom As long as we're talking about elements, a capsule containing Caesium would be sure to make an impression. Caesium metal reacts violently with water, producing hydrogen gas, then igniting the gas in an explosion. Not only that, but a dose of 4.1 micrograms of Caesium-137 is enough to kill a dog; a dose of twice that would surely be enough to kill a human, and would be such a small dose that there is no chance it would be detected in food. In summary There are a lot of poisons that would fit your requirements, enough that you can choose exactly how you want your victim to die, even down to a precise time. Do you want to be sneaky or bold? Does timing matter enough to be precise to the second, the hour, or the week? Messy, or clean? Quiet, or violent? Fast death, or lingering pain? Undetectable poison, or a brash warning to others? 

Is it plausible as a mount? Yes. It's already been pointed out that ostriches are viable mounts, and there are even ostrich races. However, it's irresponsible to assume or assert that the elephant bird would be faster than a horse. I have seen no indication we know how fast they were, so I can only point out what is comparatively true. The more mass, the more energy it takes to move. This would mean that, like the elephant, it could be faster than humans, but won't win a race with a horse. It takes more 'horse power' to make a larger beast move, and more energy to sustain it. Not to mention we know little about these creatures. Would they take to (semi-)domestication? Would they be worth the effort to encourage us to continue trying? Would they need more care and sustenance than horses and/or elephants and/or ostriches? In other words, is it worth the investment? Would their top sprinting speed be worth it? Would they be trainable enough to selectively breed them for endurance, a would be needed in a war mount? Arguably, any creature large enough to support the weight of a ride (in armour) is a viable war-time mount. All it takes is time to selectively breed them for the most describable traits, and training them to be able to handle the strain and stress of it battle. So the question, really, is what animal is worth the investment to you? 

TL;DR. One person doesn't turn the tides of war. Not even a warlord and his telepath. I think we need to define 'the whole world' first. So let's assume we're talking about Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa (given this is the middle ages you're talking about). Then we need to assume the limitations of the telepath. Let's say she can pick up the thoughts of say ten people simultaneously within 50 km of her current location (and frankly I think I'm being generous here). Now, let's look at our Vlad's resources. I'll ignore initial numbers, because he could 'recruit' from acquired villages and cities as he goes. I'll assume his forces can produce enough food to sustain a healthy diet, given their high calorie output (they are soldiers fighting a war, after all). And I'll even assume his forces can procure enough resources to arm and armour his forces properly. In other words, my analysis will be based on an ideal state of affairs on Vlad's side. I feel it can be reasonably inferred that our warlord (heck, I like calling him Vlad now) can take over a country. Let's be fair and say he takes over... France (the French love conquering anyway). So Vlad starts his conquest in France. He's high king of the Gauls, and they are quite proud of it! 

First contact with an alien life form often goes badly. In the case of Biothanata, it always goes badly. The first glimpse of this alien blob is in the form of a falling star, a meteorite. After burning off an ablative layer of rock and juicy outsides, it crash-lands. Once cooled, a red liquid leaks out of what is left of the meteor, quickly consuming any and all bio-matter around it. As it digests the grass, leaves, bugs, and other creatures, it grows, amoeba-like, sending out tendrils, splitting and reforming, but always consuming. It also digests rocks, or at least breaks them down into bite-size pieces to use, though at a much slower pace. Eventually, if nothing stops it (and nothing has, yet) it consumes all available life on the planet, barring some hardy life forms that are difficult to access. Once it grows large enough, the now enormous blob of red goo begins bunching itself together, then hurling chunks of itself high into the sky. After enough attempts, the giant blob manages to throw one (or more) smaller blobs into space, escaping Earth's gravity. Each blob is packed with rocks and dirt to use as course adjustment. Eventually, over the course of thousands of years, the majority of the space-blob sends itself out to another planet; all that's left is a (relative) handful of indigestible dust and a tiny dried-up blob. How big would the blob have to be to toss a 10-foot cube of itself out of Earth's orbit? Assume the thrown piece can start larger and accelerate itself by shooting pieces of itself off behind it, form itself into a basic wing or flying disk to catch the wind, and generally behave somewhat intelligently; also assume the "main" blob can lift and hold itself to a height of roughly half its base (higher is possible, but will cause it to fall afterwards). Edit: also assume the blob can be very, staggeringly large, nearing "planet sized" itself - as big as it needs to get before it can hurl blobs into space. Once a blob breaks free of the world's gravity, it then breaks free of the Sun's gravity by tossing various space debris behind it. Assuming it has all the time in the universe, and manages to accelerate itself as much as possible, how long would it take before it found another planet? Bonus question: Assuming a starting size of roughly one cubic foot, unchecked growth, and a digestion rate roughly equal to the most aggressive digestion of a creature on Earth, how long would it take for Biothanata to consume the majority of land-based organic life on an Earth-like planet? 

Don't jump to conclusions and start going off on how they're stabilized lazers. By this definition, Lightsabers fit: 

One thing not being taken into account is a difference in social norms. What age is considered 'their majority' or 'adulthood'? What age is common for Elves to marry? Are they more for monogamous relationships, or is there more emphasis on freedom considering their 'till death do we part' would mean living with the same flawed person for centuries? Some examples to show what I mean. In biblical times, you became 'a man' at thirteen. You were then expected to work, to marry, to start a family of your own. This in a time when life expectancy was... 30? 40? In 'modern times' marrying at the age of 30 is 'normal', leaving roughly ten years to have one or two kids. With life expectancy at 80, more or less. In both of the above-mentioned eras, infidelity in a monogamous relationship is (at best) frowned upon. Granted, there's more social pressure on the woman than the man to stay faithful, and equally granted that there are those (in increasing numbers) that do not see 'sleeping around' as infidelity. But the general rule still applies, if you are going to be unfaithful, it's usually done in a sneaky way. What could this mean? Well, either Elves choose life-partners, and stay faithful to that partner... well, for life. (Done quite well in Dark Lycan) Or they could choose a partner for 'mating season', which might be more common for the more druidic types of Elven. They might even have an elder select a number of couples for mating season, to offset how many have died since the last such event. This might even differ per Elven race, tribe, or region. After all, we humans aren't socially consistent throughout every country, race, or even religion. Why not offer your Elves the same respect?

Obstacles You're going to run into a few obstacles with your device pretty quickly. There are many more obstacles (language barrier, health, etc.), but other questions cover that pretty well. This is just about the device itself, and related incidents. Battery life Your phone will likely run out of battery in only a few hours of use. Unless you can charge it, your phone isn't going to be much use. You might be able to write down some basic schematics for building a generator and a map of ancient lodestone deposits, but even with that it will be a long time before you get a constant 5 volt supply to recharge your phone. The best fix for that would be to bring a solar charger, a hand-crank charger, or a camp stove charger. The stove would be best, then the hand crank, and finally solar power. However, batteries tend to decay over time, leaving less and less charge. Eventually, you'll need to be plugged in all the time; unless your charger can supply enough power to keep the phone running, your phone is dead. Physical damage Your phone is going to take a beating. Life in medieval times is not easy. It will not only get bounced around a lot more, it will also have to survive humid or wet conditions, and dirt and muck getting on it and in it. You'll want to get a hardened, waterproof pouch for your device. Superstition Find some powerful allies, because without them, you're going to lose your phone, and maybe your life. The ability to create light from the palm of your hand, steal images of people, and display YouTube comments will have your phone labeled as a device of the devil faster than you can say "4chan". You may lose your freedom either way, but it's better to be a servant of a strong master than dead, right? What now? So now you have a phone, a charger or three, a benefactor, and a fully charged phone with a 3G or better connection to the internet. What now? Everything The world is at your fingertips. The internet is full of schematics, DIY, and how-to manuals. Anything you could dream of is available. What's more, you have access to tools like message boards, forums, even VOIP! Where to start? What would give you the most output? Start smart Sure, you can't order from Amazon, but you could call historians, engineers, and mining companies. And with the ability to contact people in the future... make them do your work for you! Begin an investment account. Give a big box to a trusted figure, to be opened at a certain time; do your research online and find the most probable methods of beginning a bank account, accessible to you in the future. Starting with a few dozen copper pieces in each account, instructions to buy or sell, and so on, you can amass considerable wealth. If your efforts to make yourself rich (albeit through time and the Internet) fail because you aren't able to affect the timeline on the Internet, don't lose hope! There are lots of ways to make money; simply acting as a link between times and/or timelines will surely net you at least a little money. You may be able to make money from selling pictures, or raise funds on sites like GoFundMe or Kickstarter. If nothing else, posting on Worldbuilding will get quite a lot of attention (hey, wait a minute...). If you're rich, you can pay people to research for you! Even with a limited battery life, you can stick to receiving emails detailing the best steps for you to take, saving battery life since you only need to turn on your phone once a day or so. From there, it's up to you where to point your resources, though comfort, weapons, maps to mining resources, and so on will make your host rich, which keeps you safe. 

In case this hasn't been apparent yet, I'm a dark fantasy writer. So expect the 'bad guy' point of view in this answer. Your starting point: a leader. No rebellion, no revolution, no nothing ever starts without a 'visionary'. Someone with a silver tongue, that knows how to sway people -- the masses, preferably. This person will know the hardships of the people they want fighting alongside them. They'd need a compelling story to really stoke the fires of the people -- though not necessarily a verifiable one. Example. Amon, from Legend of Korra. Or frankly, Trump. Bad examples, with arguably dark intentions, but people that speak to the paranoia of the people all the same. Your rallying point: a common goal. This part comes in two parts, true to history. 

Well, this wouldn't be a sudden change. Robots aren't free -- and likely aren't cheap. So this is something that we can easily assume would take years, if not decades or generations to really happen. Based on this assumption I offer you my thoughts (hypothesis) on a plausible progression. It would start in factories where there is currently a high(er) error occurrence or low(er) error tolerance. Think welding, assembly and such (many of which are already being done by machines today, but not unanimously). These are jobs that (usually) require quite some training, but are fairly low-entry. Then it would take over the construction industry (starting with high-risk, such as high-rise buildings), but slowly working its way into all niches of the construction industry. Farmers would soon start considering buying a few robots. Starting with the bigger farms, because they have bigger budgets. Slowly, all the jobs usually offered to those with lower educational backgrounds, will no longer need them. So those with learning disabilities, low socio-economical backgrounds, and yes immigrants, will slowly be phased out of the workforce. They will be forced to start getting more and more creative over time, because everything they can do, a robot can do better, for longer, and over long periods will be done cheaper. This will start a period of social unrest. People with higher positions will start getting nervous, people will start complaining. This happens with all forms of change, but especially now because robots seem to be everywhere. Suddenly you'll start noticing robots in restaurants, replacing waitresses. Customers (especially those who've felt the sting of being replaced) will complain about the 'trash compactor' that brought the wrong order (or purposely giving them the wrong order just to make them look bad). There might even be those who find it funny (kids especially, but plenty of adults) that will start talking funny just to throw off the robots' speech recognition software. It's around this point in the transition that society would have to make a decision. After all, more and more people are starting to file for unemployment. More and more small business owners that can't afford to buy robots will file for bankruptcy because they can no longer compete. The government might start an initiative to offer financial aid to small businesses to help they buy a robot, or there might be a tax cut offered to those who hire unemployed people. Maybe both. Slowly, people who don't want to starve or become homeless will be forced to go back to school. I'm sure the government would have to offer some kind of financial aid in this, or risk entire social groups being unable to do anything but collect unemployment. So, over the course of a few generations, more and more people would have to work their way up from 'low social classes', to middle class or preferably upper middle class. This hypothesis is based on what happened during the industrial revolution, though extrapolated slightly because of the more socially geared society we (seem to) live in. Take away the 'easy road', and people will be forced to work themselves up, or risk starving in the long run. Let alone the risk of no longer being a 'viable mate' by their preferred gender (should they have one). Social pressure is a hell of a motivator, but this is only one plausible route. You could go for a more dystopian route, where the lower classes are systematically sabotaged and slowly start to either die out (not likely) or find other means of survival. It could even go so far as to develop a fringe society, tribal almost. They'd be forced to either steal to survive, or the more prideful of them would develop new means of farming. Most would find a balance between the two.
