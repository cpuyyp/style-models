The logo says "CODA" which appears to be a name applied to some Cannondale components. They have cranks and saddles branded as CODA. 

The second part of your question is whether there is space for a larger big cog on the back. The eyeball technique would be to put the bike into its bottom gear, so 36/23. Then look to see how much space is left between the top jockey wheel and the largest cog. If the bike came with 23, then 25 is likely to work, and you might be able to get up to a 28 in there. Otherwise you have to change the rear derailleur too, which is another cost. 

Or consider a hydration backpack - they work fine on the bike and when running, and generally have zipped pockets for keys, phone, wallet/ID, music, food, tools and spares. Even a belt/fanny pack might be suitable. Personally I carry one key in a fob pocket. Never lost it yet. 

How long is the mounting bolt? I'd try adding a couple of small washers between the purple and the L bracket. You can also file off the top of the L bracket for a few millimetres more clearance, or carefully bend it aft to make clearance. Another option is to replace the L bracket completely with a fabbed one that has better angles for your bike. Mudguards / Fenders are not high-precision instruments, so you can be a lot more adventurous with your alterations. 

Looks like there's something missing. The golden piece should go around the top of the black piece of the frame, and should clamp it tight without the two edges touching by the threadded bolt. The silver piece looks like a shim or a spacer of some sort, and the seat and seatpole/post has not been pictured, but would go inside the silver tube. Is there a second seat clamp (golden piece) missing, to go around the silver bit to hold it to the seat post proper ? Edit:- A google suggests these have telescopic seat posts, so silver piece is not just a static shim. The other possibility is your seat clamp may have stretched and is no longer providing enough clamping force. 

Would not recommend I have tried this - and it works well up to where it all went badly wrong. So I had an old front wheel hollow axle with a QR skewer through it. There were two locknuts and two old cone nuts set at a distance of about 100mm, duplicating the OLD of a front wheel. Sorry no photos available. This axle had been clamped onto a rear parcel rack as far aft as possible - since it was a test, there were jubilee/hose clamps and some packing. Effectively there was no movement on this part. The towed bike had its front wheel removed, and the fork dropouts in the towing QR. The towed bike was angled upward like it was pulling a wheelie. I also strapped a couple of red blinky lights to the towed bike to make it more visible, despite this being a well lit summer evening. I also fitted a secondary safety rope through the towed bike's frame and to my seat post. Car trailers must have them, seemed like a good idea. The front wheel was strapped to the rear bike's chainstay and left pedal crank, the top tube and under the saddle to give three points of securing. Strapping was done with some reusable velcro cableties, which worked well. Riding straight was fine. The towed bike was clattery and made a bit of extra noise. Reversing didn't work because I'd clamped down the pedal crank. That was not a problem. Slow speed manoevers were okay - they felt really weird but turning at walking pace worked. It all went wrong after about 10 mintes, when I was getting confident. I took a sharper turn at faster speed, perhaps 12-15 km/h when the back wheel lost all traction and I almost fell. I thought the towed bike had come loose or something. On inspection everything was secured correctly. So what happened? When leaning to turn, the third wheel (back wheel of towed bike) follows a shorter path than the front wheel and probably the middle wheel. But the QR was not able to rotate much, so that clamped on the towed fork, combined with the headset angle of the towed bike, lifted the rear wheel of the front bike. Unweighted it rose perhaps 2cm clear of the ground on a 15 degree lean. If the weight of the rider was there it would have risen less, but height doesn't matter once its clear of the ground. 

Have you ever changed the back wheel for one with a wider axle? I get a similar effect on my old 15 speed MTB, which was a 5 speed rear. When I fitted a wider wheel with a 7 speed freehub, the dropouts needed spreading by a couple millimetres. I did not parallel the dropouts, so they're very slightly shaped like / \ The upshot is that the Quick Release doesn't bite into enough metal, and sustained hard pedalling allows the wheel to move in the dropouts, eventually giving frame rub on the left chainstay - torque through the chain and cassette on the right-side pulls that side forward. In your case, I imagine the trailer hitch is on the left side and the overrun pushes the axle forward. So, the temporary fix is to do the QR up really damn tight, or to use axle nuts done up tight, or even to use softer metal washers which will deform and fill up more space between dropout and axle nut. The proper fix is to bend the dropouts back into line by cold-setting the steel frame. This takes power and leverage, and patient measuring. 

You can generally go down in tyre width without a problem because frame clearance is not affected. Going up to larger sizes needs more careful checking, but down is mostly fine. Do note your rim does not have a "1.75" measurement anywhere. Its more likely to be 20-25 millimetres in width across where the tyre seats to the rim One possible risk is decreasing tyre width can expose your rim to damage from potholes and kerbs, but this would be at about half the tyre size, and you're not near that. 

trying for a generic answer not a shopping comparison Your bike will be more stable with weight low and centered. A hub motor puts all its weight on the wheel that it is installed inside. This will shift the front/rear weight balance which should be 40-45% front and 55-60% on the rear wheel I had a home-brew ebike with 3 heavy SLA batteries. When 2 were on the rear rack it was easy to slide the rear wheel and the bike was wobblier. So I moved the weight to the lowest part of the main triangle and it got much better for handling, despite adding a third battery. So yes, moving the weight low and centered will help the riding experience, all other things being equal. 

Not really - lubes and oils need to be soft or liquid to do their job. Else they're paints. For some things spray-on "Dry Glide" may help, but that's absolutely not a chain lubricant or a grease. I have always simply tucked my right pants cuff into my right sock when riding. Short socks may not do the job so sometimes I use a velcro / hook-and-loop-fastener strap. You can roll your pants let up but I found that doesn't stay up for long. Close-fitting cycling pants may help, but I can't bring myself to wear them only, and have normal trousers on top. Chain guards is your only other option, unless you're able to pop for a belt drive bike, and my impression of belts is that they still shed dust. You didn't specifically say but I suspect you're also noticing oily hands when digging around the parts. Auto-mechanics hand cleaners like citrus-based ones, or traditional ones like Swarfega work well. You can also use toothpaste in a pinch. Another technique is to wear disposable nitrile gloves, or to rub hand cream on before you start getting dirty. 

You can either put the back wheel outside the rails and use your lock or a velcro strap to hold it in place. If someone has a real need, consider using a jack or two crowbars to spread the rails of one parking space and leave that one for those with wide tyres. They can still be used by narrow wheels too. 

Based on your description, its some kind of "cover" that would stop water dripping down the seat tube from sitting on the BB axle. Seat tubes are notorious for leaking, mostly because the slot at the back of the seat post is an entry point for water, which then weeps downward by gravity and eventually drops through the weld breathing hole between the BB tube and the bottom of the seat tube. In theory water should continue through and drip out the drain hole at the bottom of the BB, but some bikes don't have that so water collects. On the other hand some frames have ridiculously oversized cutouts like this which allow a lot of water to spray up off the front wheel: 

Yes - they're totally different for a number of reasons. The rear hub has a cassette on the right side, so the wheel has to be assembled dished. So the right side spokes are slightly shorter than the left-side spokes. 

Searching web sites like instructables.com has returned steadicam-type mounts for hand usage, but not for biking. Summary: How to reduce the road buzz that is transmitted through the fork/frame/stem and the handlebars? 

That is a "full suspension" mountain bike frame from a company called "Specialized" I can't identify the exact model - you can browse their website $URL$ as well as I can. At a guess, its a Camber or a Stumpjumper, but from some other year. 

I have one of these - it backed loose and fell off after 50 km. The only thing saving it was the safety strap. Clamp was tightened enough to chip most of the paint off the chainstay. And that was with an empty trailer! Imagine what would have happened had kids been in it? Now I check the clamp every 10 km, and I won't tow kids in it. I intend on replacing the screw clamp with with a ball clamp and fitting a 1/2" towball to each of my bikes. 

In New Zealand and Australia, bicycle helmets are compulsory, and required by law. So a bike programme must provide helmets, or specifically say to bring your own. There's not as much bike usage as one might expect if it was another large flat city ideal for riding. My city's scheme FAQ $URL$ 

Body Position In a folder its a relatively upright position. They tend to not ride hands-free very well so you need a hand on the bars at all time. But your back can be upright. A MTB position is more leaning-forward too, although not as much as a drop-bar. So you have a little more weight on your hands than on a folder. This may create steering inputs until you learn to put more weight on your feet. 

Can you tow a trailer with your car? That would be the safest and most responsible way to move your tandem. Second option would be to ride it there, over the course of a day with rest stops you and your co-rider could do 100 km. Another option would be a roof rack, like others have mentioned. Your vehicle's roof looks long enough to accept the full length of the bike. Brands to search for may incluide Thule. Possibly you're looking for three cross bars, and two normal "bike rails" in line-astern or as close to that as possible. May have issues with the front bottom bracket being super low, which means an adapter to raise the front fork a bit more than normal. Please let us know what you end up doing. 

Finally, this map is the suggested path for running to work. It follows the main road but is on teh other side, so there's clearly a path of some sort there. Not sure of the rules in Mexico, specifically whether you may ride on a footpathway. Use your best judgement. 

Those who can and do ride at higher speeds are generally fitter, often younger, and more able to bounce back from an injury. These speedy types have learned to be situationally aware, and are more alert to their surroundings and the proximity of obstacles. When I noticed this when riding quite fast on an ebike... I was looking around a lot more and riding much more defensively so if an obstruction were to appear, I already knew where my runout spaces were. Having had one significant-speed whoopsie myself that was caught on camera, I can say that perception of time really does slow down when its all going badly. Perhaps thinking "this is gonna hurt" is the key. 

Its kinda off topic because its a software question, but the software is used for cycling by a lot of people. Visit 

Can you tell/show us what you think the proper starting technique is? Personally I start with my right (primary/stronger) foot on the pedal, and push down hard. This gives enough forward momentum to stay vertical while the other foot comes up to its pedal. I tend to be seated. What's your technique ? 

Using the phrase "Primary Hand" instead of Right/Left would clear up a lot of confusion regardless of the technology of your brake. If you want to stop as fast as possible, you use your front brake, and modulate the stop by subtly varying the pressure. The best hand for this job is your strongest hand which is frequently your preferred hand, or the right hand for 70-90% of the population. So set your brakes up that the front brake is your primary hand. For shared bikes, the front should be the right side by default, or the levers need labelling and/or a small percentage should be set up as left-handed bikes. Same idea as some left-handed scissors. Doesn't matter if your brakes are hydraulic or bowen cable, cantilevers/disks/caliper or whatever. Your bike is for you, and should be set up for you. 

Depends how you personally make your power. When climbing a long steady grade, either road or offroad, you recruit different muscles depending on your angles. Sliding forward on your saddle uses more muscles under the thighs, and sliding backward uses others. So, if you move your saddle forward you're increasing time on some muscles and denying yourself time with the others. Ideally you want your body in a middling position to allow you to be forewards or aft as the need allows. Personally I like to be forward on a climb but will sit back to recover for some sections, and I like to be average on a descent and turns, but ready to push weight backwards for braking. You need to try variations for yourself, and dial in what fits. 

Front chainrings are limited to 3, practically by the width. Remember the chain is under tension as it arrives onto the chainring, whereas its under tension when leaving the rear cassette. So its much more sensitive to arrival angles on the front. I've ridden a bike with quad chainring, and it was very bad at front shifting, to the point friction shift was required with manual trimming as you moved across the cassette.
