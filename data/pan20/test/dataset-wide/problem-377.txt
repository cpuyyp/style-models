You certainly have a conundrum on your hands. Ultimately, you have a ruling class (those that control power) and various factions of a lower class. Like the current reality we live in, the lower class will be more numerous than the ruling class. When you consider what a weapon is, you come up with a simple answer... equality. A weapon is a tool that allows its user (or group of users) to kill the intended target while taking the importance off of the individual's (or group's) physical strength (to varying degrees). A weapon is needed when there is either a, an initiation of force against a stronger, more numerous, or otherwise dangerous target; or b, a defense against force initiated by a stronger, more numerous, or otherwise dangerous aggressor. This covers hunting, war, defense... basically any situation which could call for a weapon. Our current method of manufacturing our currently use weapons is both time and resource intensive. Our current stockpile WILL NOT LAST FOREVER. Without contemporary manufacturing of such weapons, there wouldn't be any reliably usable versions of modern weaponry. This ruling class you have obviously controls the means of production (they control the power) so they could feasibly control knowledge as well. If you include a way of passively defending themselves (using said power source as a shield around their island) which needs a unique device to bypass (identification pendants or some kind of genetic reader), and you have a reason why they wouldn't need weapons, and therefore would want to restrict their usage. All the lower class characters would need food, so it's safe to assume bows and arrows, spears, and other primitive weapons have resurged. Basically, you don't have weapons because the upper class is more secure without them than with them. 

The Moon is currently drifting away from Earth. The Earth is moving away from the Sun at 15cm/year. If the Moon were to somehow come closer to the earth through outside forces, then yes. Gravitational pull, if strong enough, will always pull two objects closer within a certain distance. (But currently, that is impossible.) If the Earth and the Moon were to collide, the results would depend on how fast the Moon was moving in relation to Earth, but it would be the difference between complete destruction, and complete destruction with a large fry. Earth's gravity is 9.8 meters/second (acceleration). The Moon's is 1.6 m/s. Force is equal to mass*acceleration. If you take the time to calculate that, you get a whole lot of pain for both involved. Technically gravity pulls from both objects, so you'd be looking at the mass of both the earth and the moon being pulled by the sum of both gravities... This is more force than in all the nuclear weapons on the planet, and then some. 

In a single generation? Probably not going to happen, if we're looking for a realistic total deconversion here. Give it a couple thousand years of silence, though, a dark age that destroys the paper trail necessary to verify the stories, a rising standard of living and education, and interactions with a society that doesn't share their religious views where they both have an incentive to play nice, and I think you might see it eventually fade away. Of course, it depends on the nature of the deity. What I describe would work in a sys-admin in the sky scenario. But if the deity exists within the same world as everyone else, that could make things more interesting. They'd have to find a way to escape detection for all that time, which could play into a "What if God was one of us?" trope. And if the deity fails to escape detection, well, there's all that hard work and waiting gone down the tubes! 

Absolutely. The human brain is nothing but a chemical computer, after all, and it's this chemical computer that gives rise to the mind. For me, the problem of causality is a watertight argument against any notions of duality. Once one embraces monism, I feel that the possibility of transferring one's consciousness to other substrates becomes obvious. Since dead organic matter as we know it now tends to spoil over the course of centuries, I think an intermediate step may be necessary if we're going to realistically make this happen within the next 50 years. I think mechanical bodies would be a better bet in terms of durability and longevity in storage. And if things end up taking longer to develop than planned (they almost always do, it seems), the mechanical bodies wouldn't necessarily have to house the consciousnesses controlling them. They could be "thin clients" (or "thin avatars" in this case, I guess) for the consciousnesses still in the megalithic computer on the "lifeboat." That would allow the survivors to then build organic bodies using what's available on whatever planet they end up on. Of course, cryogenics is another possibility. But that would be very energy-intensive compared to just making hyper-durable robot bodies that would remain switched off for most of the trip. My money would be on the robot bodies. Totally a possibility, because space is cold and most of the trip would be done with solar sails or something else of similar efficiency, as @bowlturner pointed out in the comments below. Note that you wouldn't need 3 million robot bodies, of course. You'd just need enough to allow everyone who needs to interact with the physical world to be able to do so. More is better to a point, but 3 million seems like it would be excessive. For technological paths that would likely lead to the vision you have here, look at neuromorphic computing and biocomputing. Again, due to the fragility of organic matter, I suspect biocomputing may be a dead end for transporting consciousness over the span of centuries. However, I also suspect it would prove to be very useful when it comes time to start creating organic bodies on the new home planet. Not sure if this has enough hard science for you, but hopefully it's helpful all the same! 

Use clothing that enables you to avoid leaving a scent for this entire operation (haz-mat suit coated in environmental fodder). Observe animal from a distance for a day, at least, noting sleeping habits, diet, temperament, etc. Find where it sleeps (as it's a warm-blooded mammal, it most likely utilize a centralized sleeping location). Test its sleeping patterns. While it is sleeping, systematically come closer at a constant pace until you disturb its rest. Mark the distance (there is no time compensation you need to do. The animal should be aware of its power's limitation, and would therefore run at the first sign of danger rather than time-jump. It would save that ability for emergencies. The 30 second ability would mean that you could have gotten closer for 30 seconds. for this situation, being further away is preferable. Either way, the point at which the animal moves should be perfect) Create an enclosure nearby which is over twice the distance from the creature's den to the mark you have made. The enclosure must be open on the side facing the current den. The opening must be large enough so as not to 'tip off' the creature. Assuming it is of animal-level intelligence, make it around two to three times the width and height of its body. The door of the enclosure must be as silent as possible, and well-oiled. Wait for it to leave its den again, then wait at least 90 seconds from that point. Examine the sleeping area, noting the materials, size, smells, etc. Take items/pieces of the sleeping area, using gloves and other means to mask scent. recreate the den in the center of your enclosure, using pieces of the old den. When the animal leaves its own den again, destroy the sleeping area after 90 seconds, taking more pieces and scattering them in a trail leading to the new den. Use food with the other pieces. Wait for the animal to follow your trail, leading to the new den, which, as it smells like its old den, and not like you, and contains easily attainable food, the animal will utilize. wait 90 seconds after the animal has fallen asleep, using the well-oiled and quiet mechanism. The enclosure's size would help avoid spooking the animal. This would make the door seem like no threat to the animal itself, circumventing the 30s power (why be concerned with what's happening 30 seconds from now if it's not a threat) allow the animal to sleep and awake naturally. Upon it stirring, use the openings in the enclosure to leave food for it. continue feeding it regularly. Begin to introduce items that contain your smell. Start these items off at the edge of the enclosure, away from the food. This will familiarize the animal with you. the outer clothing is no longer needed. Discard it. Begin to make appearances as far from the animal as possible, while still being seen. Bring and deposit food at these points. Over time this will let the animal associate you with the food. behavior allowing, continue to bring the food, but go closer and closer to the animal. Eventually, this will create a bond with the creature. From this point, follow common animal husbandry behavior until you are able to touch the animal, and then more until you are able to attach the tag secure it. Make sure to retreat each time the animal retreats. Release the animal. 

So you take a "no limits" weight lifter and a regular weight lifter of identical absolute strength. "No Limits" would be able to lift about 250 lbs while "Regular Lifter" would be able to manage a little over 200 lbs. No Limits would probably be in a lot of pain until the muscles they wrecked were repaired, while Regular Lifter would just have tired muscles. Fatigue also appears to be another such limit. Your "no limits" people would be able to walk and run for ages, given that their "cores" would be constantly repairing the damage being slowly done to their bodies. They would also be able to forgo sleep without experiencing permanent brain damage. But the healing might take a while if the relative speeds of natural healing processes apply, however accelerated they may be. (Brains are really slow and hard to heal.) And they would probably still get dingy and hallucinate due to the toxins building up in their brains. 

You might be able to have the tree construct something like nanocellulose. A sufficiently skilled person might be able to get a tree to produce cellophane as well, since cellophane is produced from cellulose. Or, if perfectly transparent windows aren't all that important, a thin, brittle sheet of dried sap might do. There might be some assembly required after the fact: support structures to remove that had been necessary during construction, for example. Like a sheet of cellulose that had been grown for the express purpose of giving the tree sap something to hold onto with while it dried. Or, in the case of cellophane, you might need to have knobs around the windows to attach the extruded cellophane to afterward. 

Yes, they could be faster and stronger than a normal human, but not by a whole lot. The mind limits what it asks of the body to ensure that it does not injure the body, but a lot of this tendency gets conditioned out of elite athletes (weightlifters in particular) during the training process. From an article in Scientific American: 

I would assume a raising popularity of IaaS provider that will replicate your content over the howl system. Even small blogs that currently are hosted in private environments maybe want to migrate to bigger providers. We would maybe also see more toplevel domains that indicate the location, like .us.earth or .mars, .pluto and .sun. The underling protocols of the internet must change drastic as the application the end user uses must change in order to give him enough information what will happens if he clicks this link. Nobody wants to click a link in twitter and sitting there for hours until the site loads. I think log distance communication will feel more like in old days before telephone. There wont be any non local news with live broadcast from the place where something happens. Nobody can ask questions to the journalists at the place. Most likely the information will still be published as soon as it is available. But the livetcker would not be live anymore. 

I'll have a limited space like $1 km^3$ that have (through handwaving) more then three dimensions. But anyone entering it would perceive it as a three dimensional space. A little bit like this video, but more or less a flat version. This results in two people walking around the same tree in clockwise or anti clockwise direction would end up at different positions. What I would like to know is how big is my surface area on which I can walk at maximum inside the multidimensional space. My first guess was, if I have a $1 km^n$ hypercube and ignore height I would have a surface area of $1^{n-1} $. With an 4 dimensional example I would have a surface area of $1km^3$. Unfortunately this is a unit of volume. So my formula is missing something to get $km^2$. I would also assume that the result would be something greater than $1km^2$ 

A religion is a social organism, so a successful religion will have to balance its own needs with the needs of its followers. From my own experiences with and observation of religion, I think these are the core elements: Contradiction/Ambiguity Times change! If your religion is too concrete and too obvious about what it means, it runs the risk of falling by the wayside. Christianity has survived as long as it has because of the ambiguity and contradictions it contains. This allows people to build whichever version of your religion best suits the time and place they find themselves in, which increases the odds that one such version will end up surviving for centuries. The only "timeless truth" is that which does in fact stand the test of time. There's no way to tell for sure what that will be, so don't try to pin it down. Just make sure your religion can be interpreted in such a way that it encompasses whatever it may need to encompass. Growth & Maintenance Make sure your religion has elements that encourage its numeric growth, as well as elements designed to maintain current members. The Christian Bible has The Great Commission as well as verses like Hebrews 10:25. Scientologists are given the edict to "clear the planet" and famously persecute ex-members. Having regular meetings and events will help build strong social ties between members and make it harder for them to leave. Good Advice Most successful religions actually impart good advice to their members that ensure they'll experience greater success than a regular schmuck would. Christianity has stuff like "whatever you do, work at it with all your heart" and "do everything without grumbling or arguing." Some of Scientology's material reads like lifehack articles with batshit crazy stuff mixed in. If your members are not successful in life, your religion won't be either. Note that this doesn't necessarily have to be monetary success: Christianity gained a lot of followers in its early days due to the crazy quantities of courage it imparted to Christians as they were being thrown to the lions. In Rome's socially stratified society, lower-class people demonstrating impressive degrees of internal strength was very notable and persuasive. Powerful Members Related to the above point, but it deserves its own bullet because getting a high-profile member will raise your religion's profile. Christianity had Constantine, and Scientology has Tom Cruise. And early on, having members who are an asset to your fledgling religion rather than a drain can be very useful. You can either make your members powerful via good advice and social support, or you can obtain members who are already powerful. A mix of both is best. Meaning Your religion has to scratch an itch other things don't scratch. It has to offer catharsis and meaning. The primary value proposition of religion for a lot of people is that it frees them from the work of having to generate their own sense of meaning. Give them rituals, symbols, holidays, practices, or whatever else they like. Give them an outlet for things they can't necessarily let out in other spheres, and give them good rationalizations that let them feel they're simply misunderstood by a misguided world rather than the other way around. They're going to need some pleasure to balance the whip of your religion's good advice. Whatever you do, though, keep it simple. Otherwise your religion will be unlikely to achieve mass popularity.
