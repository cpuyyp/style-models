In an influential speech on November 8, 2013 at the IMF Annual Research Conference, Larry Summers suggested that slow economic growth in the years following the 2007-2008 financial crisis might be due to "secular stagnation" (a concept introduced in 1938 by Alvin Hansen in his book Full Recovery or Stagnation?). The Financial Times defines "secular stagnation" as follows: 

I think the meaning of factors 1) and 2), as described above by Paul Sweezy, is fairly clear. To clarify the meaning of factor 3), I will quote from Alvin Hansen's 1938 book Full Recovery or Stagnation?, in which he introduced the term "secular stagnation": 

Of these five possible causes of secular stagnation identified by Summers, 1) is basically the old underconsumption argument going all the way back to Simonde de Sismondi's Nouveaux principes d'économie politique in 1819. 3) and 4) are factors included in Alvin Hansen's theory of secular stagnation. 5) is similar to a factor that has been discussed before in the literature on secular stagnation. Anthony Scaperlanda, in his article "Hansen's Secular Stagnation Thesis Once Again" (Journal of Economic Issues, Vol. 11, No. 2, June 1977, pp. 223-243) notes that "a number of recent innovations have been capital saving." On page 231, he identifies the data processing industry as one industry in which this has taken place: 

In answer to your first question (can you get the Euler equation without a Lagrangean?), the answer is 'yes'. At least, there are less formal ways of deriving it. In general, assuming that a consumer chooses to consume strictly positive quantities of two perfectly divisible goods $x$ and $y$, then it must be that: $MUx/MUy = p_x/p_y$ (If this were not true, then the consumer could increase their utility by shifting spending a little more on one good and a little less on the other.) The so-called 'Euler equation' is nothing more than an application of this result, viewing the 'goods' and $C_t$ and $C_{t+1}$. If you delay your consumption by one period, you put your cash in the bank for one period, earning real interest at rate $r$. Hence, if we normalise $P_t = 1$, then effectively $P_{t+1}=1/(1+r_{t+1})$. In other words, consumption tomorrow is cheaper than consumption today (assuming $r_{t+1} > 0$) since delaying your consumption allows you to earn some interest. Finally, we assume that utility is constant, time-separable and exponentially discounted (as in your set-up). Thus we need to remember to put a $\beta$ before $MU_{t+1}$. To summarise, we 're-interpret' the variables in the tangency condition as follows: $MU_x = u'(c_t)$ $MU_y = \beta u'(c_{t+1})$ $P_t = 1$ $P_{t+1}=1/(1+r_{t+1})$ Finally, observe that if firms maximise profits taking the cost of capital $r_{t+1}$ as given with total depreciation (as you assume), they hire capital until $f'(k_{t+1})=1+r_{t+1}$. Plugging in yields the Euler equation. In answer to your second question (how can you derive it with a Lagrangean?), I would recommend that you try the following steps: 

I think it may be useful to include a brief summary of Alvin Hansen's original secular stagnation theory. Paul Sweezy summarises the theory as follows: 

One possible cause of secular stagnation which Larry Summers does not mention is increasing degree of monopoly in the economy as a whole. Josef Steindl argued in his 1952 book Maturity and Stagnation in American Capitalism that "development of monopoly ... is ... the main explanation of the decline in the rate of growth of capital which has been going on in the U.S. from the end of the last century. This is not to say that other factors have not played a role..." Other economists such as Paul Sweezy, Paul Baran, and Keith Cowling have also argued that a high degree of monopoly in the economy as a whole causes secular stagnation. What theories have been proposed to explain secular stagnation? It might be interesting and useful to contrast alternative explanations of the phenomenon. What books or articles expound these alternative theories? 

In his speech at the IMF, Summers said: "Suppose that the short-term real interest rate that was consistent with full employment had fallen to -2% or -3% sometime in the middle of the last decade." Edward Lambert of Effective Demand Research explains what this means in this Youtube video. In an interview with Chrystia Freeland on April 15, 2014 at a meeting organized by the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) think tank, Summers elaborated on his suggestion that recent slow economic growth is a result of secular stagnation. In particular, Summers listed several possible causes of secular stagnation. The whole interview can be watched on Youtube: $URL$ Freeland asks Summers about the causes of secular stagnation at 28 minutes, 23 seconds in the video. I have taken the liberty to transcribe Summers' answer (I added line breaks and numbers from (1) to (5) to distinguish the five possible causes mentioned by Summers). 

I think that you are more or less than correct in thinking that cash that is never spent (nor expected to be) may as well not exist. Thought experiment: suppose that, unbeknownst to you and everyone else, £1 million suddenly appears under your mattress. If you never discover the money, it is hard to see how it could change anything in a meaningful way. There are some caveats, however. First, a game theoretic point: even if rich people never spend their money, threats to spend their money might influence outcomes. For example, they could pledge to donate lots of money to the political opposition unless the government does what they say. If this threat works, they will never need to pay out. Second, a ‘non-economic’ point: money gives you options, and people might enjoy having options in itself (even if they don’t spend the money). One might object to the kind of ‘options inequality’ brought about by an unequal wealth distribution even if rich people never spend their cash. Third, to bring us back to the real world, we should stress that, usually, rich people do consume more than poorer people. So while it might be interesting to discuss wealth inequality without consumption inequality, this is not a phenomenon which we are actually facing today. 

You are certainly right that Kahneman and Tversky neglect the importance of levels in their model (even though they do acknowledge the importance of levels informally, as in the quote you reference). However, this situation has now been rectified by Kosegi and Rabin, who include both 'levels' utility (i.e.'consumption utility') and 'gain/loss' utility (they also generalise Prospect Theory to handle many goods, and endogenise the reference point). As I understand it, the point of the Anna/Ben story is that marginal utility is a decreasing function of wealth. I would think that this is adequately captured by Kosegi and Rabin, assuming that we specify that levels utility is a strictly concave function of consumption, as is standard. Of course, a different route would be to allow the curvature of the Prospect Theory value function to depend on wealth (as you propose). However, I'm not sure what this would buy us above and beyond the Kosegi and Rabin approach. Moreover, the theory would still be missing the rather obvious fact that people do care about absolute levels of wealth, at least to some extent.
