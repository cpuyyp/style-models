Edited: I misunderstood the question. My answer (which is now starts after ``old version of the answer'' below ) answers the following question: suppose there exists a vector field along a curve $c(t)$ given as linear combination of the velocity and the normal vectors to a curve (i.e., what you we know is two functions, $a(t)$ and $b(t)$, and your vector field is actually $a(t)*T(t) + b(t)*\nu(t)$, where $T(t)$ is the velocity vector and $\mu(t)$ is the normal vector). How to understand, without knowing the tangent vector and the normal but possibly knowing the curvature of the curve, that this vector field is constant in the sence that the usual coordinates of this vector field in $R^2$ do not depend on $t$? One can of course relatively straightforward obtain the answer on your initial question which was done by Robert Bryant (clearly independet since he posted his answer few minutes before I did it) Old version of the answer: If I understand your question correctly, such connection exists and is closed related to Frenet formulas. More precisely, the bundle where the connection lives is a bundle over 1-dimensional manifold (the curve) with 2-dimensional fiber. The geometric picture behind the bundle is as follows: the fiber at each point is identified with the plane where the curve lies, where we have chosen the following basis: the first vector is the velocity vector of at this point and the second vector is the normal vector at this point. Since your manifold (the curve) is one-dimensional, the connection can be thought to be the field of $2\times 2$ matrices that depend on the parameter $t$ of the curve. If you curve is which is arc length parameterised, the connection is given by the formula $$ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \kappa \\ - \kappa & 0 \end{pmatrix}, $$ where $\kappa(t)$ is the curvature of the curve. The required condition that a parallel section in this connection corresponds to a constant vector field follows from Frenet formulas. 

If $\mathcal{L}_v J= 0$ and $\mathcal{L}_v \Omega= 0$, then $\mathcal{L}_v g=0$ so $v$ is a Killing vector field. Indeed, the property $\mathcal{L}_v J= 0$ is equivalent to the condition that the (local) flow of $v$ preserves $J$ and the property $\mathcal{L}_v \Omega= 0$ is equivalent to the condition that the (local) flow of $v$ preserves $\Omega$. Since $g$ is costructable by $J$ and $\Omega$, if both $J$ and $\Omega$ are preserved by the flow, then $g$ is preserved by the flow as well and the vector field is Killing. Hamiltonian vector fields have the property $\mathcal{L}_v \Omega= 0$. If your definition of ``real-holomorphic'' implies $\mathcal{L}_v J= 0$, then the answer on your question is yes, yes, yes, ya, ya, ya. 

This is both: answer on the new version of the question and comment on comment of Andrey Gogolev, who asked whether one can make the question more complicated assuming additionally that the set of non-periodic geodesics is dense. Hier is an example that answers both: it is not much different from the answer of Andrey from his comment (and also from katz's answer). Take a torus with periodic coordinates $x,y$ and a liouville metric $(X(x) -Y(y)) (dx^2 + dy^2)$ on it (whose geodesic flow is integrable). Make two small holes on the torus near the points where $X$ has minimum and $Y$ has maximum and connect by a neck. For generic $X$ and $Y$ and generic neck the set of nonperiodic geodesic is dence but still it has a 'regular' region in the tangent space where no geodesic passing through at least one point of neck can come. The closure of a typical geodesic from the regular region is a torus in the tangent space which is projected to an annulus on the torus and after passing to the universal cover this annulus becomes an infinite unboundend band. One more remark is that by KAM theory, this examples survives if you slightly perturbe the metric. 

Dear Dean, Dear All, This is hopefully the last (4th) edition of my answer. I spend few hours in calculations which could be dismissed would I think a bit before doing them. I believe that now I understand what happens and what most of you probably knew before. First of all, there exists no canonical construction $K\mapsto E_K$ of an ellipse by a convec body (I understand canonically as ``depends only on the linear structure and on $K$'') such that it satisfies $E_{tK} =E_K$. The reason is that this would imply the existence of a canonical euclidean structure in a 2-dimensional space equipped with a linear complex structure, which is wrong because the group of the linear transformations preserving a complex structure is bigger than the group of linear transformations preserving a euclidean structure. Indeed, consider a two-dimensional linear complex structure on $\mathbb{R}^2$, i.e., fix a matrix $J$ such that $J^2= -1$. The group of linear transformations preserving the complex structure evidently contains the scalings $(x,y)\mapsto \textrm{const} \cdot (x,y)$ and therefore can not preserve any euclidean structure. Suppose there exists a canonical construction of an ellipsoid $E_K$ by a convex body $K$ such that it behaves as follows w.r.t. to linear transformations: for every linear transformation $A$ with $det(A)= 1$ we have $A E_K = E_{AK}$; for every scaling $S:\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $(x,y)\stackrel{S}\mapsto \textrm{const} \cdot (x,y)$ we have $E_{SK}= E_K$. Then, we can construct a canonical scalar product on our $\mathbb{R}^2$. Indeed, having $J$, we have a canonical notion of a circle centered at $\vec 0$. More precisely, in every real linear 2dim-space we have the notion of an ellipse. A circle around $\vec 0$ is an ellipse which is $J-$invariant. As you see, in order to define an ellipse we used the linear structure of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the complex structure $J$ only, so any linear transformation that preserves $J$, in particular every scaling $(x,y)\stackrel{S}\mapsto \textrm{const} \cdot (x,y)$ takes a circle centered at $\vec 0$ to a circle centered at $\vec 0$. round Now suppose your construction $K\mapsto E_K$ exists. As $K$, take the round ball centered at the origin. The freedom in choosing such a convex body is its scaling $K\mapsto \textrm{const}\cdot K$; if the construction do not depend on scaling we obtain that the freedom in choosing such a convex body does not affect the ellipse $E_K$ (which must also be a circle because of the symmetry) we obtain a canonical inner product on $(\mathbb{R}^2, J)$. There is no such product though, by the reasons I explained before: the group of complex transformations is bigger than the group of the orthogonal transformations. Thus, there is no hope to construct a scaling-equivarinat and linear-transformations-invariant ellipse by a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^2$, so it must something be wrong with the announced properties of the construction from the question. I should confess that first I thought that the problem is with the invariance of the construction w.r.t. linear transformations, and bothered Deane and you all with attempts of counterexamples. No, the problem is not with the behavior of the construction w.r.t. the linear transformations! The problem is that the construction is NOT CANONICAL. Indeed, it depends on the choice of the euclidean structure in the space: if you multiply the euclidean structure by a constant, the resulting ellipsoid will be the initial divided by the square of this constant! Actually, since the construction is indeed invariant w.r.t. to linear transformations with determinant $1$, one can think that the information we need from the euclidean structure is its volume form only. This was pointed out by Deane to me in one of his comment, with a hint that normally should be sufficient for me to understand everything without doing the calculations. It is also stays inexplicit in the edited version of Deane's question. By the way, the ``original'' version of the construction in the paper MR1781476 (2001j:52011) Lutwak, Erwin(1-PINY); Yang, Deane(1-PINY); Zhang, Gaoyong(1-PINY) A new ellipsoid associated with convex bodies. Duke Math. J. 104 (2000), no. 3, 375â€“390. 52A40 (52A39) does have additional term inside, which makes the construction to be volume-form-independent, but the resulting ellipse does not have the desired property $E_{tK}= E_K$ anymore. Now, if you do not require the property $E_{tK}= E_K$, there exist tons of canonical constructions of an ellipse by a convex body. You even can do these construction the whole-affine-group-invariant, by first moving the body such that its barycenter is located in the origin of the coordinate system you are doing the construction starting from.
