first of all, this should be 0.8-1.5g of protein per LBS of body weight (not kg), and no, this doesn't depend on lean body mass, although it would be more important, the more muscle you have. Protein is absolutely essential for fat loss since it is the hardest macro to turn into fat, has high thermogenesis (your body burns more calories during breakdown), spares your muscles and provokes protein synthesis (good for metabolism), makes you feel full and more...make sure you get at least 0.8g per lbs of bodyweight.DON'T listen to anything else, this lean body mass thing you heard does not apply here, eat as much protein as possible without going over your caloric limit. 

Assuming you don't have any allergies to any of the ingredients in the box, and even if you did, tingling isn't really tied to allergies. Also assuming, that you tried drinking the protein out of two separate bottles. Since maybe there's some residue of some agent causing this in one of them. Additionally assuming that this is the only supplement you're taking. If you're taking ANY pre workouts or creatine supplements, the beta-alanine amino acid will definitely cause tingling. Now, the thing with Optimum Nutrition's protein supplements is that they contain high amounts of amino acids. As you can see from the container, 4-5.5g of them. It is VERY likely, and I'm almost 100% certain of this, that because you are just getting accustomed to this new supplement, your body is very sensitive to alanine, which is present in high amounts in that exact supplement. This amino acid is basically known for causing tingling sensations. The beta alanine itch is simply the result of nerve endings underneath the skin which are stimulated and firing at a higher than normal rate. It is not a cause for concern and is experienced by the majority of the lifting community at some point. Luckily, (and kind of unluckily), your body will slowly become insensitive to this, just like it would with caffeine. This is why your second time was milder than the first. So to sum up, nothing to worry about, Optimum Nutrition has very high amounts of BCAAs, which are essential for protein synthesis, after a few more times of taking it, you won't notice the beta alanine tingles. I wish I still could. Moreover, it could also be possible that you're psyching yourself out, there's research showing that you can placebo yourself into getting amped up for a workout, with the same effect as some pre workouts. 

It's more or less impossible to answer a question like this over the internet, but since you said "I lose everything in a matter of days", that gives me two possible reasons for your case right away. The first is just the obvious answer. It's your genetics. Some people respond extremely well to exercise. Here's something by T-nation: 

Great question! I'm gonna reference my answers based on "Cribb, Paul J, Hayes, Alan, "Effects of Supplement-Timing and Resistance Exercise on Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy." Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise, 38(11). Pp. 1918-1925. ISSN 0195-9131, 1530-0315." and "Tipton, et al, "Timing of amino-acid carbohydrate ingestion alters anabolic response of muscle to resistance exercise." American Journal of Physiology - Endocrinology and Metabolism, 1 August 2001, Vol, 281 no.2, E197-E206 DOI:" Now, before your workout, you want to consume something that's going to slowly release you solid amounts of energy over a long period of time. In other words, you want a food that releases your blood sugar minimally so you don't spike your insulin as much and do all of the nutrient transport work at once. Foods that accomplish this task are complex-carbs or as you mentioned low-glycemic carbs, which include oatmeal, brown rice, most veggies and some fruits. Also, it is not wise to think ONLY in terms of carbs for pre-training as protein is equally as important but luckily not anywehere near as complicated. Simply consume some protein with this carb-meal, (20-50g is ideal). By ingesting protein before and during a workout, you spare muscle protein, negate protein degradation, and set the muscle up for regeneration and remodeling. Loading protein and carbs before and again during the workout also leads to fat oxidation that continues long after the workout. To understand what you must consume "during" your workout , i.e in that little interval you have, you must understand what's happening in your body. First, If intra-workout insulin is low, glucagon robs muscles of amino acids so it can convert them to glucose. Low insulin makes it possible for catabolic hormones to "steal" your energy and ultimately muscles. Muscles need carbs to do work, but they also need protein. During a workout, amino acid requirements go up 500%. Based on this, and a few other studies that I've looked at over the years, it is best to consume a BCAA (branched chain amino acids) supplement. There are tons of these available, and I'll let you look online to find one that suits you economically. Furthermore, if you read the above carefully, I also mentioned a bunch of negative things happening while your insulin is low during the workout. Well, what raises insulin then? The complete opposite of complex carbs...simple carbs (or high-glycemic foods). A VERY VERY good high GI carbohydrate that also has a bunch of other benefits are bananas! So eat a banana or two during this interval with some BCAAs and you are golden. You can also eat carrots, melons ,pineapple, quick white bread sandwich with protein in it (ham, turkey whatever). You didn't say you wanted post workout nutrition help but if you comment that you would like to then just let me know :) EDIT: I completely forgot another supplement that raises your insulin that you could consume during your workout, and this might surprise some people, but it is just plain old whey protein. Whey has been shown to spike insulin in hundreds of studies (primarily caused by leucine). 

This is one of the biggest myths in nutrition, you do NOT need to eat 5-6 meals a day. People think that since eating meals has thermogenic effects on metabolism, then the more often you eat, the more calories you burn. This is NOT true, there's lots of studies disproving this (the amount u eat is proportional to thermogenesis not frequency). The reason 5-6 meals is usually suggested is because it is easier to divide your macro intakes into 5-6 rather than 3 big meals. Also, eating frequently will make you feel full more often. However, you mention glycogen breakdown and you are actually right. The more often you eat, the less you're in a fasted state and hence the less time your body has to breakdown carbs for energy (i.e you won't reach fat breakdown since youre constantly breaking down carbs), and this is why I said eat your carbs around your workout and not any other time if you're actually SERIOUS about fat loss. This means before and after the workout (1-2 hours withing both). A good approach would be to eat breakfast, lunch, preworkout meal with carbs, post workout with carbs, then dinner...this way you have lots of time between meals to burn fat while burning carbs for the workout and not muscle. 

This is highly individual and depends on your goals. However, the best time to consume carbohydrates are period of high insulin sensitivity. This would be right in the morning when you wake up, and right before and after your workouts. Remember the main function of carbs is energy, so ideally you want to minimize their intake when you don't actually need them or it will be harder to burn fat. On the other hand, you don't wanna eliminate them completely because you will lose muscle easier. So for example, morning meal: high protein med carbs low fat, snack: high protein low-med fat, pre-workout: high protein med carb, post workout - high protein med carb, lunch/dinner and rest of the snacks- high protein med-high fat. Basically, just eat carbs around the workout and the morning. Eat fats when you dont eat carbs for energy. Eat protein ALL the time. 

Alright so first of all don't get your hopes up too much. Bodybuilders are probably the most shredded individuals on the face of the planet during their contest prep! The key word here being contest prep. They will start being extremely strict with their calories and macronutrients around 12 weeks out from a bodybuilding show. There are a lot of tricks that they use to achieve a very cut look (I competed a few times), but for the most part it's just drastic calorie and macro manipulation on a VERY consistent basis. So first of all, you have to understand, it is NOT the supplements that give you a ripped look, not even close. ESPECIALLY not the legal ones, BCAA and creatine have absolutely nothing to do with shredding fat so I'm not sure why you even brought them up. Whey protein and BCAA are of importance during this intense cut only because they help the athletes maintain the max amount of lean muscle that they can. And since more muscle equals more metabolism, keeping more muscle will make it easier to lose fat. Other than this there's no purpose for these supplements in a fat loss cycle. All fat burners do is make your fat cells more mobile during workouts so you're more likely to burn them, but if your diet isn't 100%, good luck...it won't happen, especially when you get to single digit fat percentages. Now they do use some illegal supplements of course. Testestorone, clenbuterol, t3, trenbolone acetate...etc, these are all used to help with the ultimate shredded look. Some of them help increase metabolism, while some of them help with the mobilization of fat cells, to a much greater degree than any supplement out there. Now if you want that look, you're gonna need to be honest with yourself. Do you actually have enough muscle such that when you do get that cut, you're going to look good ? Otherwise you'll just look very skinny and most people tend to not want to look like that. But if you still do wanna look like that it's very simple, NOT easy, but simple. Alright so in order to achieve that look, all you need is a very consistent caloric deficit. When you get to very low levels of body fat, you absolutely HAVE to count in order to make progress. There is no other way around it unless you have the genetics of Zeus. You need to figure out your RMR and subtract at least 500 calories from this number and aim to eat that amount of calories every single day for a week. If you lose weight then good keep going, if you didn't you need to adjust it down by 100-200 calories and try again. Once you have the calories down you need to manipulate your macros. In order to be safe it is crucial to get at least 1g of protein per lbs of bodyweight in order to preserve lean muscle. You can even increase this to 1.5g. Once you get the protein down you need to manipulate your carbs and fats. Usually, you'd avoid all carbohydrate intake until around your workout (pre and post). This is so you don't raise insulin and inhibit fat burning. If your body doesnt have carbs as energy it will either burn fat or muscle but since you have lots of protein, it's more likely to burn fat. But when you workout, you don't wanna take this risk, and your workout will suffer without carbs, so eat most of your carbs (70-90%) around your workouts. If you are going to eat them at other times make sure they are complex, low GI carbs so you don't raise your blood sugar. For other meals, replace the carbs with fats, always keeping protein high. Now, when you get very close to contest, there is a pretty neat trick that is done in order to look incredibly ripped. Since you've been depleting carbs throughout your entire diet, your body basically "forgets" how to handle them efficiently. So, for a few days, you eat very high amounts of carbs. Once you do this, your body overcompensates and stores even more glycogen than previous in your muscle cells and you look a considerable amount fuller and bigger. If you have low amounts of body fat, this will make you look a lot more ripped than you actually are. Combine this with extreme water cuts and voila, you look "ripped". But you HAVE to understand that in order to make this work, you need to be at a low body fat level in the first place throughout weeks of hard dieting. Moreover, that "look" that you see is only maintained for a few weeks at the very most. If you look at fitness models/bodybuilders in the off-season, their body fat levels are a lot higher than photoshoot/contest days, so it's important to be realistic. Just don't believe any supplement that will get you "shredded", you can't buy fitness.
