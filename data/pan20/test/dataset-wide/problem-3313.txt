Indeed, reuersio is what you want to look up. Here's my first-order approximation of why this is so — I trust that it is not too inaccurate! The classical Latin alphabet had only the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, Y, Z, where I represented both /i/ and /j/ and V represented both /u/ and /w/; by the Middle Ages, the Latin alphabet had also acquired more-or-less the now-familiar lower-case forms a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, x, y, z. However, j and v only appeared still later, as allographs of i and u, respectively, and it wasn't until after the Renaissance that i and j systematically represented /i/ and (what had at least been) /j/, respectively (e.g., cujus for cuius), and u and v systematically represented /u/ and (what had at least been) /w/ (e.g., vos for uos). At any rate, since the Latin orthography of classical antiquity only knew I and V (which originally gave rise to the lower case forms i and u), many modern editions and references use only upper-case I with lower case i and upper-case V with lower-case u, (I presume) in order to adhere as much as possible to the original orthography whilst allowing for the normal use of upper- and lower-case letters. 

I'm looking for languages (as many as possible :P) outside the Mainland Southeast Asia region in which there is a single morpheme performing two roles: 1) Clausal nominalisation. I will define this as the process whereby a clause is turned into a nominal whose referrent is the event referred to by the head of the clause. An example is 'that' in 'that the enemy destroyed the city'. 2) Subject/agent nominalisation. I will define this as the process whereby a clause is turned into a nominal whose referrent is the S or A argument of the original clause. An example is 'what' in 'what destroyed the city'. This single morpheme can be affixed to the verb, cliticised at the end of the clause, but it should have similar or identical formal behaviour in the two cases of nominalisation, and ideally, it should not allow object nominalisation. It. Thanks in advance! 

What you're describing is the Neo-Štokavian accentuation, the characteristic innovation of the Neo-Štokavian dialects of Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (including all the current literary forms), which apparently dates to no earlier than the 16th century. Very crudely speaking, Neo-Štokavian falling accents continue earlier accents on initial syllables, whilst Neo-Štokavian rising accents result from a shift where accented inner and final syllables retained their higher pitch, but had the actual stress retracted to the preceding syllable. By contrast with the marked accentual innovation of Neo-Štokavian, the pitch accent of the Čakavian dialects is apparently an extremely rare (if not unique) partial continuation of the accentual system of Common Slavic, and as such has attracted considerable scientific attention from Slavists. My apologies if I have bungled any terminology (or even worse, facts)--I'm afraid I'm a mathematician, not a Slavist! EDIT: I also see, to my embarrassment, that slavist has already said all that needs to be said on the matter. Had I the reputation, I'd have simply added a comment to his answer. 

Because in English, to-infinitivals with an overt subject always require a subordinator for. See Huddleston (2002, pp. 1178-1181). Here is another example but in complement position: 

and thus, since [for + NP + to-infinitve VP] is now a nominal constituent, we can have sentences like this: 

I think a few issues need to be cleared up first. Firstly, the first source you mentioned is an ESL source rather than a linguistics source. If you'd like to learn more about linguistics, I'd suggest consulting more linguistically-oriented sources like Payne's article, since ESL sources tend to be simplified - they are, after all, aimed at language learners, not linguistics students. Secondly, another issue to be cleared up is whether we're talking about descriptive categories, which are specific to languages or comparative concepts, which are used for cross-linguistic comparison. It seems here that we're talking about descriptive categories, but you did not specify this in your question, so I think it is helpful to make this explicit. This is because the discussion of what constitutes a lexical verb and a copular verb in English has nothing to do with, say, French être or Mojave iðuːm, or even Middle English be. Finally, Payne never defines the lexical verb as a copula verb. He is, in fact, arguing against the treatment of the copular verb be as an example of a lexical verb. He regards it as an auxiliary, and uses several kinds of evidence to show that the copula be and the auxiliary be behave the same way morphosyntactically except when the difference in behaviour is purely semantic/pragmatic. More generally, lexical words are generally those that form an open class in the language, i.e. a class of words to which words can be added freely. For example, in English, you can easily form new words, e.g. you can form new lexical verbs by X-ise meaning 'to make something like X'. It's much harder to form new auxiliaries like can or may. This is the 'general idea' behind the distinction. However, these criteria seem not to be really helpful for determining whether be is lexical or auxiliary in its predicative use, since we don't know whether be belongs to the first group or second group just by looking at it. This is where morphosyntactic criteria come in: We can define lexical verbs and auxiliary verbs by means of their morphosyntactic behaviour. This is the whole idea behind language-specific descriptive categories. Descriptive categories are invented on a language-specific basis to describe the particularities of the grammar of a particular language, in this case English. Payne cited language-internal evidence for treating the copula and auxiliary be both as auxiliary, e.g. be can take the negator not and be fronted in questions, whether as a copula or as an auxiliary for tenses: 

It's probably not a record holder, but to be precise with Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, it has been written in the Latin, Cyrillic (both in the standard form and in an extinct, western form called Bosančica), Glagolitic, and Arabic (the so-called Arebica). Arebica saw use until WWII, Bosančica seems to have gone extinct by the 18th century, and Glagolitic for the vernacular was probably extinct by the end of the 18th century---Glagolitic for Croatian Church Slavonic lasted until 1927, albeit with partial use lasting until Vatican II. 

Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and French all have a (compound) perfect tense, which I find curious, given that Latin did not. (You can alternatively perhaps say that it is either united with the perfect and preterite/aorist tenses, rather than it not existing, but in either case, Classical Latin did not have a separate or compound perfect active tense.) My question is then: where did this compound perfect tense come from in the (Western) Romance languages? And why are there two of them? The Germanic languages I'm aware of (English and German) both have a compound perfect tense, while German uses both "to have" and "to be" as auxiliaries. The uses of these auxiliaries aligns rather closely with uses in both French and Italian, while of course Spanish only uses the single auxiliary "to have", like modern English, albeit with a slightly different sense.

This construction later became the perfect, which asserts that a past action has effect on the present - a similar meaning to the resultative. The participle now no longer agrees with the object and the auxiliary and partiicple should usually be adjacent. In the Romance case, the resultative was already present in Vulgar Latin, both in have + participle form and in participle + have form: 

I always learnt it was pronounced the same as how 'e' is usually pronounced in German (in either its short or long forms respectively). But then the question is: why have a different letter for it? Surely the original sound must have been different? 

I have often wondered why French is (almost) unique in the Romance languages in using the guttural 'r' – in particular, the uvular fricative. Apart from Piedmontese / Piedmontese Italian (and even there it's far from universal), French seems to be the only Romance language that uses this sound, whilst many Germanic languages and dialects use it commonly. Occitan on the other hand did and even now does not use it, as far as I can tell, and many Southern French speakers still tend to employ the more traditional Latin alveolar sounds when speaking Standard French. Now, I came across this curious map of the distribution of uvular rhotic usage in Western Europe, which shows a clear geographical cluster. Most surprisingly though, areas of common usage appear to cross significant linguistic boundaries (Romance-Germanic) quite freely! 

I'm not terribly familiar with the syntax of PPs, but I've noticed that a handful of them do not seem to satisfy any constituency tests, particularly 'than'. 'Than' is listed in dictionaries as both 'preposition' and 'conjunction'. The former is likely referring to cases where 'than' precedes - and, supposedly, governs - an NP. For example： 

Here are the number of times that each possessive pronoun appeared at the end of each sentence in the British National Corpus per million words: 

(See Wikipedia for the key.) Initially, I thought the guttural 'r' might have been an old Germanic feature that spread into French, even as far back as the Franks perhaps (which would certainly explain its greater prevalence in the north of the country), but there is apparently clear evidence (from Molière, no less) that as late as the 18th century in Paris, the alveolar trill was being used to pronounce 'r'. Hence I wonder, is this phonology truly a modern innovation? If so, where and precisely when did it originate? And how did it cross the linguistic barrier so that it permeated both Romance dialects and High German, Dutch, and the North Germanic languages so thoroughly? I presume that these phonologies are not independent, but perchance even this premise is wrong. 

I figured I'd give an answer with respect to the languages mentioned With regards to questions, Chinese is wh in situ, and consequently has no need for coverb stranding - contrast this with the translation (sorry if you hate this construction): 

Note that this does not mean everything works. For example, adjectives can go to predicate positions, but adverbs cannot! You can say 張三的死很突然 (Zhangsan-possessive death very sudden) Yet you cannot say *張三的死很忽然 (Zhangsan-possessive death very suddenly) As a side note, in Classical Chinese, adjectives and nouns can act as transitive verbs, indicating another flexibiltiy in position, but not in Modern Chinese:
