To combat the KKK and other groups, the North placed the South under martial law. They pushed through legislation while the Southern states had no representation in Congress permanently freeing the slaves and giving them voting rights. Then an occupation force was sent to enforce it, since this was pretty much unpopular with everyone, not just the Klan. Martial law would be lifted and then reinforced several times. There are no documented attacks against the occupation force of Union soldiers by the Klan or other similar groups, so there wasn't too much strong enforcement against them specifically during Reconstruction by the Union. Thousands of deaths are documented as attributable to racial violence during this era. Much is mob violence, suggesting that the tension was deeper than attributable to one organization.

But I'm wondering why then are the methods so different? If they just switched over, the model should be the same logically speaking. The usage of America as a penal colony is explained as a transfer of prisoners sold as indentured servants. Were these indentured servents treated differently than other indentured servants? I believe that the colony of Georgia, which would be similar to penal colonies in Australia never operated. Is it in any way a model for Australia? How did the Australian model, convict transport, develop? 

Occasionally, some states dissolve for other reasons, which likely they could not have helped: Epidemic disease The American Indians which encountered the Spanish for example. Natural Disasters Volcanic eruption, tsunami, mass unavoidable crop failures 

The Corwin Amendment was proposed in 1861 by the House Republicans. This amendment would have made slavery legal permanently in the US, so the House had to have been discussing slavery. According to Wikipedia 

Of course! There are major differences between the ideology of Germany, Japan and Italy, but there is one major similarity: they disliked the communists. 

Corn and potatoes are the native "grains" to the United States. Peanuts (in the Southern US), alfalfa or hay have traditionally been used in crop rotations. Turkeys, deer and bison in the Great Plains were the major native protein source. Bison were intentionally killed off as a genocidal measure against the Plains Indians, but we continue to eat turkey. There were no native domesticated farm animals or beasts of burden in North America, so settlers brought these over, such as horses, oxen, cows, and hogs. Wheat, oats, barley and since the 1950's soybeans have been farmed extensively as well, which were brought over too. Farm animals, like horses, cows and oxen do not eat corn. (Today now we have our ways of making them eat it by processing it...) So, corn is an excellent crop for small farmers that do not keep large, expensive farm animals, but rather keep only hogs, turkeys or chickens. The farmer doesn't have to grow too many crops to feed himself and his animals with the system. In early America most farmers were yeomen farmers. In the Southeast, this model was very popular. Corn as far as I can tell does grow most places in the US with suitable farm land, even in the Southwest. I don't think its soil issue, although it might be, (see below "Dust Bowl") as much as a climate issue. Europe is colder than most of the US. Since wheat requires a colder climate, it was grown in the Northeast and then extended into the Midwest where it was found to grow very well. There are some historical reasons why wheat was not popular early on. Although the Northeast grew wheat, oats and barley farming was not extensive since the land suffered from soil erosion quickly and it was not profitable. The reason given is farming practices using oxen, which were non-native, and deep plows used up the the land too quickly. Also, in early America there was not yet railroads to move the wheat to market, so people ate what was local. Midwest Wheat was first grown in large amounts in the Midwest in the mid 19th century, because there were agricultural markets, a suitable cold environment, and it was useful in crop rotation with corn. Another possible reason the Midwest starting growing wheat is that large amounts of German immigration meant that it had a unique culture. In Germany wheat is the major crop so that's what they grew. German immigrants were also instrumental in altering American beer. If you want to read about corn beer, see this 

2) Drainage was very important and the bricks are a good building material to handle possible floods from the Indus River. (Brick is more porous than stone, so it allows water and moisture to move through it more easily) Archeological evidence proves that Harrapa and other IVC towns experienced flooding from the Indus River. IVC towns have intricate drainage systems and earthlinks to protect the towns from flooding. It is theorized that the usage of brick was also developed as a protection. 

Thucydides (460-395 BC) is one of the world's first historians. Although he uses methods we would not use today, he isn't lying or using "myth," per se. He is attempting to use history to be instructive. He is a political historian teaching lessons he felt would defend democracy by teaching his people moral lessons. Even around the time, the idea was criticized. If I recall, Aristotle (384 BC) delegated historical parallel to one of the lowest forms of political argument (although all forms of poetic arguments were altogether improper, illogical, so it is still above these). Consider for a moment how many times you have been told a dictator is like Hitler and thus something must be done or else we are all Chamberleins. While Thucydides might have meant well, the Greeks figured this problem out very quickly. Arguments about Helen of Troy were particularly common...did she start the war, etc... Thucydides probably did understand that he was dramatizing his history by adding in dramatic speeches or Greek myth, since in the forward of his book he says that he will be attempting to provide a nonromantic view of history free from myth. He also selectively adds speeches and two person dialogue only in locations where it will be politically instructive. 

When was the concept of Europe as a singular political unit conceived? When did people start to think of themselves as sharing a similar European culture and calling themselves European? For this answer, I don't mean the Roman Empire or Christendom, as these include many areas outside Europe, but specifically "Europe." The EU would be a good example but I'm hoping for something much earlier. 

The Confederacy was fighting to become an independent nation. Although we call it the "Civil War," the term may cause confusion, sometimes. The Confederacy started a campaign to attack the North to force it to surrender, but it was not attempting to conquer and take over the North. It wanted the North to surrender and allow it to accept it's secession. The answer is resoundingly not the last. Washington DC would not be transferred. The answer to the question should be the first. The Confederacy would have demanded a split, along the areas already defined by the state governments. The reason to do this is to end the war. If you split the territories up and give Union states to the Confederacy, people will keep fighting. It seems unimaginable the Confederacy would have demanded whole Union states, except perhaps Maryland, which was in some ways really not a Union state. It was conquered by the Union and proclaimed a Union state with only marginal popular support for the Union. It would be a good candidate to be split, as well. This letter does seem quite difficult to find, but here is Lee's letter to the people of Maryland. I will post in full, since I think it answers what we can assume would be the contents of Lee's terms for surrender and its an interesting historical document: 

The term Radical Republican comes from the Dunning School (Burgess-Dunning School or Progressive School). This was the majority viewpoint from 1900-1950. It was derogatory. A "radical Republican" is motivated by vindictiveness, revenge and party politics, rather than national reconstruction, healing after the Civil War or a genuine motivation to help the freed slaves. Dunning was a historian who lived during Reconstruction and gave that term to the Congressional Republicans of that era. As this school of histiography is discredited, finding objective information on it is very difficult. According to the Lew Rockwell Blog, Dunning used 5 classifications for Republicans: Presidential, Southern, Conservative, Moderate and Radical. So not all the Republicans were considered "radical" during Reconstruction. Thadeus Stevens was his usual example of a radical Republican. 

Eugenics based antisemitism predates WWI and Nazi antisemitism in particular appeared directly as a result of WWI. There is no break in the time line that allows for Hitler to be hostile to anything else before being a racist. The Nazi's virulent antisemitism comes from Hitlers mentor, Anton Drexler, the leader of the German Worker's Party, the precursor to the Nazi party. He originally led the Fatherland Party. Hitler entered politics in 1919. For example, the Nazi's 1920 25 Point Program, composed by Hitler, includes: 

It is not selection bias. Types of writing should be compared only against a comparable type of writing, controlling for the education and social class of the author, using comparable methods to a proper cross-sectional analysis. This is commonly done and then the text is placed into a software program to create a text analysis, so there this an "objective" answer to this question, but we simply do not know what it is at this time. For example, a speech by Abraham Lincoln could be compared to a speech by Barack Obama; a letter written by Sherman to a letter written by General Petraeus; a letter written by a low ranking army conscript with little education to an email written by a modern high school senior. I feel certain that the differences in style would remain quite striking. This should not be surprising, since language, art and writing styles change over time due to social influences. No one today would say, as per the OP: 

The largest case of a nation using a proper legal system I can think of is following the Third Servile War, the famous slave revolt led by Spartacus, the Romans condemned and executed the remaining 6,000 rebel slaves that had not been slain in battle. The slaves involved were gladiators, so it was difficult to crush the revolt. Slaves are civilians, even if gladiators. Due to the fact that slaves are not citizens and the timing of the revolt is in the late Republic, the slaves involved should be subject to the imperium. The justice system became more corrupt and the military more powerful as Rome became a dictatorship. This would mean that they would have been "tried" in a sense by a magistrate with the power to hand down military justice. 

Before the eventual unconditional surrender of Japan after the dropping of the atomic bombs, the government was considering orders for mass-suicides "modeled on the 47-Ronin incident." By the time Japan surrendered, 10,000 civilians are believed to have committed suicide. Many in the military also committed suicide by crashing planes into American ships. 3000 Japanese sailors were found aboard one ship who had all committed suicide rather than be taken prisoner. The information sourced here is mostly from Wikipedia. I suggest the book "Girl with the White Flag" (white flag for surrender) for a personal historical account of the absolute terror Japanese civilians felt when American troops approached. They believed the soldiers would brutally murder them. This wasn't the account of Japanese history I learned, so I read more up on this. The information can all also be found on Wikipedia. I learned that the Emperor had very little role in the war, but this is apparently was a fabrication by the US to exonerate him from war crimes. The best and newest evidence shows he was intimately involved. The US did this perhaps to make Japan easier to govern and occupy, as the emperor had an important symbolic role to the Japanese people; and also, the US put all blame on the military, therefore discrediting them. They told the Japanese that they and the Emperor had been tricked by the military. Hirohito offered to stand trial for war crimes and the US refused to allow him to do this. 

The sermon was written after the start of the Conspiracy, which started in the Spring of 1741. It isn't known if Edwards knew about it, but it can be assumed that he did, since it caused wide-spread hysteria. As far as direct evidence linking the event to the penning of the sermon, it appears that the evidence thus far available is only circumstantial. Edwards was a slave owner and his views and sermons about slavery waxed and waned over his career, but he supported an end to the international slave trade and the humane treatment of slaves generally. Not much has been written about Edwards, which is why it is difficult to know if there might be a relationship. In 1995, a great deal of new information was discovered about him in the form of personal letters. Kenneth P. Minkema has been studying these letters and Edwards other personal writings and published a paper in 2009, Jonathan Edwards's Defense of Slavery for the The Massachusetts Historical Review Vol. 4, Issue NA. I am referencing his work unless otherwise stated. Edwards wrote sermons in the 1730s clearly referencing slavery themes and then seemed to abandon the theme until the summer of 1741. It is possible he is talking about slavery in Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God, but it is difficult to prove. (Minkema would suggest it is most likely not about slavery and Edwards pro and anti slavery views were influenced by personal considerations, mainly a personal attack on another preacher who was unpopular with his followers, as well as religious and ethical concerns.) What can be proven is that several weeks after writing the famous sermon, he wrote down thoughts strongly condemning slavery. His sermons written directly after Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God are thus absolutely anti-slavery. These anti-slavery sentiments coincide with the Conspiracy of 1741 and an abolitionist movement within his church community. The timing would suggest the event did influence Edwards to write other important sermons and influenced the Great Awakening. The event may not have impacted this particular sermon, though. 

The Renaissance occurred in Europe from the 14th-17th centuries. The main difference to me compared to Asia is that Western Europe at this time experienced relative peace and government stability after centuries of constant warfare and invasion in the so-called "Dark Ages." Europe did not however experience religious stability, which allowed new secular ideas to flourish. The Black Plague, rumblings of the Reformation and the Aviognon Papacy (anti-pope) occurred in the 14th century all undermined a central religious authority. Other parts of the world were still experiencing internal warfare and many parts of Asia did not have access to enough outside ideas due to policies of isolationism. In Asia, the largest powers were China and Japan. In the 13th century Japan and Western Europe repelled invasion by the Mongol Empire, but China was conquered by them until establishment of the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century. The stress of warfare with the Mongols caused the government of Japan to become deeply endebted and it was overthrown, starting a period of internal strife. Influenced by Confucianism, the Ming Dynasty in China started a long period of isolationism in the 14th century, which hurt its ability to include outside ideas in cultural and technological progress. Due to the collapse of the Kamakura government, this time period until contact with Europeans in the 16th century in Japan was an Age of Civil Wars. Feudal lords fought to control the Kyoto court. The instability in the country likely contributed to an inability to have a "Renaissance." Japan then entered a period of isolationism in the 17th century. 

As far as is known, Indus Valley homes were built from dried or baked mud or clay bricks. Stones were not used. A few other materials were used to compliment the bricks to make the roofs, floors, interior walls etc. Although hundreds of sites have been identified, only three cities have been yet excavated. Harrapa was the first town discovered, but other cities are believed to have independent rulers, even though they are part of the same single state. With few exceptions, most other buildings would be made from regular sized baked bricks throughout the town. Stone was used only very rarely in very important structures like a temple (although some archeologists dispute that the Indus Valley Civilization had temples or religious buildings). The explanation is two fold: 1) The lay-out and planning of Indus Valley towns was very structured. (It's much easier to make many bricks that are exactly the same than to cut stone in standard sizes, especially before modern tools.) 

Because phenol was not very effective in causing swift death, the Nazis injected it into the ventricles of the heart. (In other words, its an unusual choice) The first execution using lethal injection after WWII was in Texas in 1982 using a more effective three drug protocol. Alternatively, other countries use overdoses of barbituates.
