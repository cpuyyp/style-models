You should not have any problem with regards to your rear derraileur. it will work with a wide variety of shifters. I've mixed many derraileurs within the Shimano brand across various product generations (usually from 7 speed to 10 speed). My limitation would be I've not used 11 speed equipment. There are some exceptions. For example the Shimano AX series derraileurs from the 80's will only work with friction shifters. . For the fronts, there is some information on Sheldon that indicates that there may be issues with brifters and your derraileur. I've used brifters with a very similar derrailuer to to the Tourney and it works ok. My only concern would be the triple cranks that you have and its compatibility to a triple front shifter indexing. That I cannot comment on 

Lets say you wish to replace a crank similar to yours and you cannot find the exact same crank as the one you have. BIG PICTURE: Unless you can find the exact same crank as yours, you'll need to purchase both a crank and matching bottom bracket. A guide for choosing a crank is listed below 

Alternatively you could use a hybrid bicycle. 29" wheels with slightly knobby tyres, upright handlebar and some come with a front suspension, though I would select one without. 

Apart from more obvious issues like mal adjusted front derrailleur where the chain would rub against it at certain positions (this should not occur when you are using the middle rear cog).... I once encountered a sandy gritty feel on the pedals on a bike with new but very cheap cassette and chain. after ascertaining it was not pedals (rotated the pedals alone by hand) and not the bottom bracket (I removed the chain and pedaled) I eventually found it to be the very new and very cheap cassette (we are talking those new 6 speed freewheels with the Shimano brand on the the largest cog) to be at fault. After a swap with a very old and used 6 speed freewheel (good quality circa 1979) the transmission was smooth as butter. On another time with my first foray of replacing chains, i had incorrectly placed it on the rear derrailleur jockey wheels. It then rubbed on a metal tab as it traveled through the jockey wheels Another time I had replaced a chain on an old 12 speed bike with a NOS 1970s Shimano chain that I think had rivets that sat too far proud that it rubbed against the cassette when one was in the taller (smaller) gears. Recently I adjusted a brand new aluminium road bike that when the bike was on big in front and small behind, the chain would rub on a weld seam at the point where the chain stay meets the seat stay. Another time I set the front derraileur too low and it was lightly brushing against the teeth of my crank chainring. 

FYI, I finished an 8,200km tour on these tires with no punctures, and a decent but not complete level of wear on the rear. I would not have started another long tour with the same tires. IMO, your tire probably has 5,000km left in it, but you should suck it up and buy a new tire before your next tour so you're less likely to need to replace mid-tour with the challenges that come along with that (Where to buy replacement? Do you need to get them shipped to a hotel? Etc.). When you're finished your second tour, you'll probably have 4 Marathon tires that all have a decent bit of life left in them and you can run them into the ground commuting around town or Randoneurring, situations in which it's not a big deal to have a tire wear out (just replace it at home at the end of the day). That way, you've got plenty of tread for your upcoming tour, and no tires are going to waste long term. 

Can someone tell me what this pin is doing, and was I supposed to remove it before riding the bike? If I'm not supposed to remove it, in what maintenance scenario would I ever remove it? If I was supposed to remove it, is it possible I've done damage by riding with it in place? Thanks. 

In your case there are no bikeways of any kind showing: pathways, or even shared lanes (dotted lines) on the bridge: 

I'm curious to get some opinions on this from other cyclists. FYI this event took place in Ottawa, Canada. On my work commute, there are about 3 blocks where I ride in the lane with cars because there are no bike lanes or sharrows, and I need to make a left turn in one of two left turning lanes, onto another street which also has no bike lane, and no shoulder. Details below in photo. During that part of my commute two days ago, I stopped at a red light, in the middle of the left turn lane at the front of a line of several cars. The car behind me honked while we were still stopped, clearly wanting me to get out of his way before we'd even started moving. I stayed where I was since there was nowhere to go: another left-turning traffic lane to my left, and a straight through lane on my right that only buses can proceed through. After taking the left turn, I proceeded in the center of the lane for one block before signalling a right turn, after which I normally ride on the side of the lane because there is more space. While I was riding the block right after the left turn, the driver who had honked at me pulled into the other lane to pass, then while passing, i.e. while right next to me, quickly swerved back about halfway into my lane, coming within about one foot of me while I was riding, then back out into his own lane. This was clearly meant as a threatening maneuver to scare me. The vehicle did not make contact with me. I was able to memorize his license plate, make and model, and car color, and I took note of the exact time time, so I can certainly pinpoint who it was in a police report. So I'm wondering if it's worth reporting something like this to the police, or will that just be an exercise in frustration? If anyone has any tips or suggestions on reporting something like this, I would appreciate it. (Again, this is in Canada, so any locally relevant tips would be great) 

As I understand FSA has all kinds of BB standards I don't have a sure answer for you, but if the splines match up and the crank sits securely then its a go. however you may find that due to crank/bb compatibility, the crank may actually sit further out or further in which will thus affect your chainline which then affects your shifting. Additionally the octalink is an older standard that is more difficult (at least for me) to find. Thus I'd honestly suggest that if you could, go the Shimano and their hollowtech 2 BB route. the BB is lighter, their hollowtech cranks are stiffer. you can feel a difference when you pedal, 

I second the suggestion to try the bike. My experience is as follows I'd always thought that having a bad and inflexible back that I would prefer to have my road bike handle bars more or less at the same height as my saddle. So two road bikes later, set up in this way and i've not been comfortable. In fact I've found more comfort in road bikes that have handle bars significantly lower than the saddle or in city bikes where the handle bars are significantly higher than the saddle. So big picture you'll need to try it.. and be open that you may not get it right the first time. I've spent loads of time playing with saddle position, handle bar position etc to find that perfect fit... I'm almost there... I think. Some considerations for you. If you are intent on city riding.. cycling on bicycle lanes and start-stopping in traffic and looking out for pedestrians, being as upright as possible is much more enjoyable / safer But if you're going for more or less uninterrupted speed and distance, a bike that gets you more hunched over will be more aerodynamic (especially over the 25 km/h) range I'm almost 180cm and prefer my slightly undersized 54cm bike over a more 'appropriate' 56cm 

Measure the length of the Bottom Bracket shell. If it is 68mm or 73mm you're in good shape because thats a very common 'British' or 'ISO' size Count how many chainrings you have. 1? 2? or 3? 1 is a little tricky as its hard to come by, 2 (yours looks like 2) is commonly a 'road bike crank' and 3 is commonly a Mountain bike crank, though there are also 3 for road bike too. Count the teeth on the chainrings, or look for markings that may indicate the number of teeth (e.g.. 52teeth for the big one and 39teeth for the small chainring). If you like the gear ratios on your bike I suggest you stay with the same number with little deviation Count how many cogs you have at the rear. 6,7,8,9,10,11? Anything 9 and below will allow many interchangeable cranks. 10 and 11 will require specific 10speed or 11 speed cranks ( i suspect yours is 8, thus you could get a crank designed for 9 speed or less. don't get one for a 10 speeder or higher) Length of crank arm is less important for me. but you can select the same number as yours. 175mm With that information, I'd suggest to get a crank and matching bottom bracket for your bike. If you are using a square taper or Octalink or similar Bottom bracket your replacement crank may fit in it, but the length of the spindle of the bottom bracket may be incorrect for your crank.. so its very tricky. for example for square taper bottom brackets there are about 6 or more different spindle lengths. getting the length wrong could mean incorrect chainlines and issues with the drive train. So unless you get the exact same replacement crank.. you'll need to get a matching bb to the crank. At this juncture you might consider one of the HollowTech 2 cranks/bb from Shimano.. they work well and have less issues with spindle lengths though it may be challenging to get cranks for 9 speed or less unless they are old stocks. 

I have a 2010 Specialized Tricross Sport Triple. I want to know what type and size of Bottom Bracket I need to replace the original one. Specialized's archived page for this bike lists the BB as a "BB-7420 w/crank bolts". From what I've read online, this is a British threaded, square tapered, 68mm BB. From what I've read elsewhere online, a common replacement for this is the Shimano BB-UN55, at around $15 CAD online. However, I haven't found a consensus about what length the Tricross needs. Here someone says 118mm for the 2011 Tricross; Bikepedia lists 113mm for the 2010. Is there any way to figure that out without taking the bottom bracket out to read the specs off of it? And is there any other spec beyond the threading, width, taper style, and length, that I need to ensure compatibility? Finally, if there's a better replacement than the BB-UN55, I'd be curious to know about it. I'd like to stay under $50 CAD. Thanks. 

I just bought an RSD Sherrif II fat bike and it has a carbon fork with a thru-axle. It appears to be a non-quick release axle - no lever of any kind, so I need an allen key to remove it. I have a few questions: 

There are lots of great answers already, I'll just throw out one more thing: you could check around for a cycling skull-cap with an SPF rating. One example is this one from Giro, rated at SPF 30. It's designed to go under a helmet for summer use, and has an SPF rating. Presumably any fabric will keep some sun off and could therefore have an SPF rating, but since this one actually provides the rating, you can compare it to sunscreens you've used to determine if it's sufficient. In my experience, SPF 30 is plenty for most conditions. I haven't used that Giro cap myself, but I did use some Pearl Izumi SPF arm "warmers" which I actually found cooler than riding without sleeves. I used them on tour, sometimes doing 6+hours in the sun without sunscreen on my arms, and never got sunburnt while using them, whereas my back would sometimes get mildly sunburnt through my wool jersey. 

So, you'd take a < 30 minute one way ride in the morning for 1 Euro, ditch the bike for the day, then take a (probably different) bike home for 1 Euro. 2 Euros round trip. That's probably cheaper than taking transit, and I challenge you to find a bike rental for < 15 Euros daily. Even if you can, as noted in the comments above, you then have the additional worry of theft/ vandalism, and hassle of having to return it to a bike rental place when you're done. If you want to do a longer bike ride or full day of bike exploration before or after your conference, you could do a one-day proper bike rental for that.
