To start with, each situation will be different. E.g. if you have an overhang and your partner is hanging freely in space, you may need to handle things a bit differently. Lowering an unconscious leader is also dangerous, as lower-angle terrain can exacerbate their injuries, and getting them caught on an unseen ledge could introduce slack. Also, if you have a sufficiently strong tag line, tying it to the end of the rope and removing some of the lower pieces of protection may allow you to lower the leader down. I suggest viewing the various self-rescue skills as a toolkit, from which you assemble a plan for each situation. Escaping the belay is one of many tools you have to work with. Some of the basics you should be well-practiced in include: 

Traditionally a bear bag was simply something to hold your food out of reach of bears. This usually meant finding a way to suspend it from a high branch, and in this instance it's usually sufficient for the bag to be waterproof. (With this in mind, some people like to hang the bags "upside down" to prevent rain getting in through the top. Be sure to tie them securely closed if you do this!) There are different methods for hanging, but a common one is the PCT method. To briefly summarize the method: 

Preuss even wrote a series of principles to express his ethics of climbing, criticizing the use of any artificial mean (including the rope) for the progression. However, people like Preuss were rare, and most of the alpinists in the world didn't bother about how a summit was reached, as long as it was reached. The debate about the the ethics of climbing made a return at the end of the 60s and of the early 70s: the advances in technology and the diffusion of the expansion bolt had made possible to climb almost anything, as long as you had enough gear and patience. The excessive use of bolts and artificial means was strongly criticzed, amongst the others, by Reinhold Messner in Italy, who wrote in 1968 the famous article The murder of the impossible and by Royal Robbins in the USA, which described his ideas in the book Advanced rockcraft (1973). Adventure and boldness were still considered prominent in rock climbing, and not much stress was put on technical difficulty. Therefore, using too many artificial means was seen as a betrayal of all climbing was about. Things started to change in the late 70s/ early 80s. In some circles attention began to shift from the heroism of climbing to the technical difficulty. An important step in this process was the invention of modern rubber-soled climbing shoes in the early 80s. 

A helmet tested to the EN 1385 standard is not intended for use in white water class V and VI. For those who haven't done the math, a 2.5m/s speed corresponds to only about a 0.3m drop, or about half the speed most helmets would be tested for. The reasoning is apparently due to the expectation that someone floating in water will have difficult reaching high speeds. Beyond applying impacts to different parts of the helmets there is no multiple-impact testing included in the standards. Low-speed impacts to a helmet that meets either standard will simply fail to crush the foam and the force (though distributed by the helmet rather than focused) will be passed along to the head. (Some types of multi-impact helmets might make use of materials like EPP foam instead of EPS, but the rebound behavior of EEP is still, I believe, not yet well-characterized.) References: 

The two most famous pioneers of sport climbing of sport climbing in Verdon were the two Patricks: Edlinger and Berhault. I don't know much about the birth of sport climbing in the USA, but this article identifies Smith Rock as one of the birthplaces of this activity:

As far as I know, the "change of paradigm" that led to the birth of sport climbing happened between the 70s and the 80s, and it happened separately in Europe and in the United States. From the early 1900s to the 50s, rock climbing was mostly seen as a "tool" necessary to reach the summit of a mountain. There was no real distinction between "aid climbing" and "free climbing", too: the goal was to reach new summits and to establish new bold first ascents in the mountains, whatever the means. Of course, there were those who advocated a purer climbing style, as for example the german Paul Preuss: 

Emphasis by me and that is the point I am interested in. Did you made similar experiences? And if so, why is this the case? 

Of course your outdoor equipment has no problems with getting wet. It's not getting any damage if used in rain. While wet the function of your gear may be influenced, e.g. in the case of rubber soles and chalk this will be inevitable the case. Your gear is designed and exists to be used outside where it may rain. Even back in the old days when they started climbing steep rock with the newly designed rubber soles they got wet. Back then climbing gyms weren't available and people even couldn't imagine that some decades later hundreds of people crowd up in tiny rooms to climb on plastic walls. So don't be afraid of wet gear, just treat it right. Dry it properly, especially if you are hygiene-conscious. And avoid to go climbing outside in bad weather, except you really know what you are doing. 

There is an alternative to this, and that is the Ursack. A kevlar sack designed to resist tooth and claw, you need only leave it on the ground and loosely tethered to a tree (to prevent the bear wandering off with it). Finally, you should also consider whether rodents will be a risk. They are quite acrobatic and can chew through many materials. Odor-resistant bags or rodent-proof mesh bags may also be useful. 

In the context of camping, it's perfectly safe to wear a down jacket. Keep in mind that fleece is typically also made from synthetics, and so can be expected to have similar properties to your down jacket. (Actually somewhat worse, given the texture.) A table of synthetic fiber characteristics at $URL$ provides the following information: Both nylon and polyester will melt and burn in a flame, but stop burning when removed from the flame. Polypropylene and polyethylene continue to burn when removed from the flame. For activities where there is a greater risk of exposure to heat or flame (e.g. hot air ballooning or glassblowing) it's common to require only natural fibers* such as wool or cotton. This is because synthetics melt as they burn, and can fuse to your skin which increases the severity of the burn. (Cotton actually has greater flammability than nylon, but has the benefit of not melting.) Finally, a fabric's characteristics will also affect how it burns. A looser weave allows greater airflow compared to a thick, dense weave, and a fuzzier surface texture can make it easier for flames to propagate. (Example: using dryer lint for tinder vs. a piece of smooth paper.) The fabric may also have been chemically treated with flame retardant or DWR coatings. *Nomex is also useful, but unless someone is a firefighter or race car driver, they are unlikely to have such a suit lying around. 

Figure: the south-east face of El Cap. From www.xRez.com The first ascension of El Cap passing through the Dawn Wall was realized in 1970 by Warren Harding and Dean Caldwell after 27 days on the wall (source). The name given to this route was Wall of the Early Morning Light (WEML). Since then, other routes have been established on the Dawn Wall, most notably (source): 

Another important event that marks the birth of sport climbing is the first climbing competition: Sportroccia, in 1985 at Bardonecchia, Italy. The competition took place on real rock, and not on artificial walls like modern competitions.

I am looking for a book or digital database of rock climbing pictures from before 1950. I tried to search online, but, except for a few pictures, I didn't have much luck. Also, the name of the photographer and/or the source are often not reported in the pictures that I found online. The period I am more interested in is the 1920s-40s, the "golden age" of rock climbing in Europe. To be even more specific, I would be very happy to find some photography book/database about climbing in the Alps in the 1920s-40s.
