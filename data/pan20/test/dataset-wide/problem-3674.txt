I did a hiking vacation once and intend to do it again this summer. It isn't too sternous, and it involves sleeping at tourist lodges* and only wearing clothes in the backpack (no food or sleeping bags). I have never done any serious work outs, and have a sedentary lifestyle and weak muscles. So this is quite a big increase in physical activity for me. A downside I noticed last vacation is that the food available at the lodges is very different from my usual diet. I eat moderately low carb, with maybe 90-100 g protein intake a day, and my carbs come mainly from vegetables. There are often days when I don't touch any starchy staples. The lodges, on the other hand, offer cheapest staples energy-boosted with vegetable oil. It is not unusual to have a stew consisting of rice and potatoes only, as a complete meal. If there is any meat, it is low-quality ground meat stretched with fillers before turning it into meatballs. The result is that in my most active period of the year I am getting 10-15 g of protein instead of my usual 90-100. It was noticeable last time I did it: I felt lethargic. Not tired from activity (it was an easy trek), but really languid. So this time, I want to bring protein with me. I've heard that professional sportlers have protein supplements, and thought that I can use these. Somebody said that I could take protein bars with me, but these turned out to have a fairly low concentration of protein, around 30%. Not only am I better off choosing a high quality salami, it means that I'll have to take almost 300 g per day, so 2 kg for the whole seven days. This is a very big addition to my 4.5 kg backpack, and I am looking for something more compact. And in Amazon reviews, some people complain of a very soft, marzipan like consistency - this is certain to get squished in the backpack. There are shakes too, but this doesn't sound very convenient for hiking. They need a shaker, which means more volume and weight in the backpack. There is always the risk of spillage of powder in the backpack. And then reviewers often hate the artificial taste, noting that it is sometimes impossible to get it down, especially when made with water instead of milk. I won't have milk available, and I dislike the taste of processed food in general. So this option has lots of drawbacks too. Is there a good protein source I have overseen? Or if bars or shake powder is the best option available, are there any tricks how to mitigate the problems with them? *I couldn't find a good translation for that 

Volume is going up faster than area. The area went up roughly double, where volume more than tripled. So what happens is as people get bigger, their relative strength goes down, because they are adding more muscle volume than strength. Of course, more muscle isn't always detrimental -sprinters are jacked- but in general a heavier person is carrying around more dead weight. 

Think of the humerus as a lever. Top of the lever being the shoulder, bottom of the lever being the elbow.            As the bottom goes backward, the top goes forward:            Image source: Why typing annoys your neck, shoulders, elbows and wrists, and what to do about it You've probably seen that old cop move to disengage a suspect, where they pull the arm way behind the suspect. In other words, the further your elbow goes behind your shoulder, the more the humeral head goes forward, the more likely you get pain in the front of the shoulder. So impingement of the AC joint isn't the only concern. Excessive anterior glide of the humeral head can also cause pain. You mentioned you can't move the elbow as far back when the shoulder is abducted 90 degrees. That is, when trying to move the elbow back in this position, anterior glide of the humeral head is more likely. You have less room to move the bottom of the lever back before the front of the lever goes forward. This is one reason people feel better bench pressing with their elbows in, rather than out. Or, if the elbows are out, why a person will feel better with a floor press than a regular press. With the floor, the elbows can't go as far back. Example: $URL$ Impingement is a concern too though. As the arms get to about 90 degrees of abduction is when the shoulder blades kick in with upward rotation:           Made from this video. However, during a dip, we are doing the opposite of what happens when we raise our arms. When we abduct to 90 and past 90, we protract and upwardly rotate the scapula. During a dip, we're abducting the humerus, yet retracting (and possibly) downwardly rotating the shoulder blades. (For instance, someone who has focus on "shoulders down and back.") 

Short answer? Yes it does. Chairs are designed to help us maintain an upright position, while taking the load off our legs. They aren't designed to sit on for 8 hours a day, every day. Once a human being starts doing this, bad things happen to the body. A squatting position is a lot more natural, and sitting on a chair for hours can actually harm our spine, hips and make us less flexible. Resources: 

It's not bad for you but it's not optimal either. It's not bad for you to drink this much and go workout instantly after, but it takes some time for your body to actually absorb all of the water and hydrate your body. You're better off drinking this amounf of water up to 30 minutes before working out. During the workout drink little sips of water to keep you hydrated throughout the workout. 

This is purely genetics. The only thing you can do is develop your chest to make it show more, but you cannot change the shape itself. 

It's not optimal, but you'll do just fine for an amateur/hobbyist. The reason it's not optimal is you would want a maximum of 48 hours of rest in between working the same muscle group. I'm guessing you're doing bodypart splits? In that case there will be a lot more than 48 hours in between the workouts of the same muscle groups (up to a week probably). Doing a push and pull split with these trainingdays will probably work best, you should give it a go! 

TLDR: Yes you can, but you'll be doing the same stuff over and over, which your body will get used to. The basics are that it's calories in vs calories out when it comes to weight loss, so doing what you're saying will work to lose weight (if your diet is good). Your body will get used to the movement that you're doing though, so the results might decrease after a long period of doing the same thing a few times a week. To lose weight it might also be a good idea to start swimming, it's great because it won't put a lot of strain on your joints which can be a problem for overweight people. 

When you have long femurs relative to your torso, it's harder to stay upright. Those femurs push your hips back as you go down. Leaning the torso forward is an understandable compensation: if you try to stay upright, you're much more likely to fall backwards. This is a big reason olympic weightlifters have short legs relative to their torso. Yes, short legs means not having to move the bar as far, but it also means an easier time staying upright. (Remember, if you fall forward in a front squat -which is the position of the catch in a clean and jerk- you're much more likely to dump the bar.) We can take this further. Notice how the more low back oriented squat involves more hip flexion. The knees are more into the chest: 

In the above, you tend to have some bony overgrowth, making it more likely two bones pinch -"impinge"- the structures between them. Thought process being shave the bone down, lessen the odds of impingement. Precisely differentiating between genetic overgrowth or acquired has not been adequately done yet, and is not easy to do.        -Longterm studies are hard        -Hip impingement surgeries have been on the rise.         -Are we better at diagnosis         -found another way to make money         -are more hips genuinely deformed from activity modification e.g. more kids playing sports?         -is it because adults are loading their hips in flexion more i.e. sitting more than ever? Hard to parse out. It's an area ripe for research, however, we'll likely find what we seem to always find with the nature vs nurture debate- both matter. A caveat though is how much nature or nurture matters can vary with lifespan. What happens early in life can leave an impression tough to overcome. Notice how after having a fibula harvested, the tibia can grow to be the size of the tibia + the original fibula. Right side of person was harvested: 

I would suggest doing heavy compound movements like deadlifting, squatting and bench pressing. Preferably doing sets of no more than 5 reps. You can even build up to 1-3 reps on extra heavy sets. Add isolation exercises to each muscle group and do higher reps on these, 8 to 12 reps per set. You could also add some cardio but this isn't necessary so if you enjoy cardio go for it, if you don't, don't. As for food, I would suggest finding out what ammount of calories you need to maintain what you already have. I'd go for a diet high in protein to build muscle. If you eat to many carbs you might find it hard to lose the excess fat, even though that is very personal (I personally don't gain fat on a high carb diet but I know a lot of people that do). 

The reason is that to maintain some form of muscle you need to feed your body. A person with a proper nutritional diet will have abs. If you feed your body properly while maintaining a low bodyfat percentage, your abs will be visible. People in famine don't have enough nutritions, so their body starts to burn anything to stay alive, including muscle tissue. Because of this they still have abs, but they aren't defined enough to notice. 

It's very normal that a girl of only 90lbs will have trouble picking up the bar since it's 45lbs, which is half your bodyweight. Anyone would have issues picking up half their bodyweight when they just start out lifting. You can absolutely become stronger and gain weight if this is your goal, you'll need a few things in order to get there: Consistency: This point can't be over stressed. Being consistent in the things I'm about to list will be the key factor. The right mindset: Don't think this is going to happen over night. Make a plan for atleast 6 to 12 months, this is a sport of patience. This will help in having realistic expectations. Diet: Having a healthy diet is going to be one of the most important things here. Your body will need fuel to grow and become stronger therefore eating enough and eating healthy is very important. Working out: Start out with weights you can handle and do all exercises with proper form. Mastering the basics with smaller weights will create a proper foundation for you to strive from when you become stronger. Going heavier just because you want to live heavy weight will only hurt your progress in the long run. If this means only doing bodyweight squats at first, this is fine! Loads of people can't even do 10 bodyweight squats so if you can even do this, it will help you work towards doing squats with added weight. 

It's unlikely that kind of reaction can occur from exercise. At least on any desired timescale. Finally, I always mention with this type of stuff, when you gain something, you lose something. While you might be enticed by thicker bones, many are looking for thinner. A powerlifter loves thick bones. Someone interesting in running does not. Often what one considers to be a structural defect can be repacked into a structural advantage. Those basketball players, as their hips thicken, yes, they have less mobility, but they're also less likely to break a hip More details on the hip- 

I say non-fat because there is more to lean mass than muscle. Water, organs, etc. More about this in a second. Precise body fat can be very hard to come by, and you want to be careful about guessing too much. I'll have a link about that towards the end. In general though, if you can see a person's abs, they're likely 10%, or under.           Fancier An important caveat here is height. If you find someone who is a few inches shorter or taller than you, that throws the numbers off. An old school way to approach this is for every inch above five feet, add five pounds. So, all else being equal, a person who is 5'5" will weigh 25 pounds less than a person who is 5'10". I honestly don't know where this number originally comes from. But there are a few numbers like this which float around in the exercise science world, and you'd be surprised how well they hold up. (Another one is if you want to know your maintenance calorie intake, take your bodyweight and multiply by 15. e.g. most 200 lb people eat 3000 calories per day. Amazing how well that works. Not every time, but often enough.)           The dedicated Next, you can consider joint width. People with wider joints tend to have more muscle than those with smaller joints. There is a calculator for this, which I'll get to in a second.           The hardcore Finally, if you're going pretty out there on the muscle curve, and that aspirational picture suggests you are, you need to consider drug use. Once you start getting around abs visible, 190+ plus pounds and average height, drug use becomes more and more likely. I have no judgment against drug users, I'm merely saying it needs to be considered based on goals. The fact is drugs help hypertrophy. I find it worthwhile knowing, or at least having a very good sense, whether a goal can be attained without them or not. The earlier one has this knowledge, the better. For instance, if one isn't willing to take drugs, there is no point in chasing a Ronnie Coleman physique.           More Help If you're looking to get fancier: Lyle McDonald has a good source for,
