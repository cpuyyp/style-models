When I decided to get back in biking around 2 years ago (After not being in a bike since I was a teen) this was around the same amount of distance I had to pedal. My bike was a Schwinn Ridge Al mountain frame with slick tires and during the first week I couldn't complete the commute for more than 2 days in a row. After the second week it became a lot easier and since then I commute by bike almost everywhere within 20Km. 7Km is quite a small distance but depending on your current fitness you may need to bike only 3 out of 7 days the first week (With resting in between). After that it will became really easy for you. I checked your route using the Google Streetview and found there are a lot of bicycle taxis out there, which suggests these roads are plenty used by bikes and you should have no problem with traffic speed, but be very careful with the basic cycling safety measures. Sticking to the same traffic patterns should help to make things safe enough, but you may want to ask fellow cyclists for tips. If you already own a bike, give it a try on any free day! That will let you have a better understanding of what will be required. 

Maybe I'm crazy but I use plain road (700/18s or 700/20s) tires. They are Kevlar reinforced though... 

I was in to cycling quite a lot in high school, but was unable to and/or really lazy in college. I've been getting back into cycling lately, doing a 65 miler two weekends ago, a 25 last weekend, and a 45 yesterday, in addition to biking to work (about 3.5 miles up a large hill in the morning, the same distance almost without pedaling on the way back) 6/10 days of those weeks. Woke up this morning and I'm really really sore everywhere. Am I doing something wrong? Do I need to just "cool it" for a couple of days? 

I really don't like indexed shifters, at least on the front. They're harder to adjust, more sensitive to cable stretching, and limit the number of gear combinations you can use (because you can't adjust the front derailleur cage manually to not rub on the chain). So.. why are they impossible to find these days? 

The tube size shouldn't affect the feeling of the tire at all (Unless the walls stretch too much and blow out... But that's a different matter). It seems like something is preventing the air from flowing inside the tube itself and it is being trapped somewhere between the tube valve and the pump. You can test this just by plugging the valve in the pump, does it fills the barometer? If not, the reading you are getting when pumping up is from air trapped (And pressurized)somewhere else than the tube. 

What type of shifter is it? As there are several kinds (Friction, stem, twist, rapid fire...) and whether if a "Really bad shape" is the most likely cause will vary. With down tube frictions shifters for example, they need almost no maintenance (Besides tightening the screw now and then) but with twister shifters it is common for the internals to wear out and not being able to stay on place. As mentioned in another answer if you don't trust this bicycle store, take your bike to another one for a second opinion and get things clarified. 

The only significant frame damage I can think of from this is your skewers -- the little nubs that grab on to the skewer and hold your bike inside the trainer have a tendency to scratch the hell out of the skewers. As far as flexing goes, all frames flex. The only time I would be worried about it would be if there was a grinding noise coming out of the crank -- but that wouldn't be caused by your trainer, that would just be impending crank failure. Oh, and rather than getting a trainer only bike, you should probably just get a stationary bike (if you do decide to go that route). They're typically much smaller because they don't have to have two wheels, and because they're designed for that use from the beginning they're typically much more stable when riding. 

I've been using a CatEye Stealth 50 GPS device to record some of my longer rides. I've not been using it for commuting though because my commute is only ~30 minutes, and the CatEye takes 3-5 minutes to start recording data. I don't want to add 10% to my commute time just for GPS lock :)* Would upgrading to one of the Garmin devices like an Edge 500/510/800/810 make a significant difference in initial lock time? (I'm somewhat spoiled by my cell phone and car that achieve locks almost instantly) * That said, the CatEye was only $150, and at that price I couldn't be happier with its performance. 

Short answer: Not necessarily. Longer answer: Time ago wheels started to have more standard sizes (650b,700c) and at some point manufacturers made tires with a slightly lower size but labeled as standard, which still happens nowadays. Judging by the picture, the tires you used are some Continental Grand Prix 4000 S II which are slightly bigger due to the ticker tire compound, and if you were to try some Continental Gator Skin from the "Same" size they would simply not fit (Since the ticker shell for extra puncture protection make them bigger than measured in most cases). Still, that amount of clearance is pretty low and I have seen it only on aerodynamic frames which try to keep the turbulence at minimum by eliminating any gaps between components. If this is not your case, you may want to go with smaller tires in order to have some clearance (To avoid scratching or damaging the components due to any debris stuck in between). 

There's a plastic disc between the cassette and rear wheel on my bicycle. It doesn't seem to have any effect on the actual drivetrain; but I've seen it on a number of bicycles. What is it for? 

I think most any frame is going to suit you just fine -- consider size, riding position, cost, and weight. Outside of that, one generally doesn't have to worry about frame failures or anything of that sort, with the exception of crazy carbon racing frames. I think this is the point where you go to a local bike shop and try a few of them out -- look at what's available, and choose one you like (that is, that you feel comfortable riding with). As far as things like welds, you really don't have to worry about the frame failing on you. Better welds are lighter, but that's really the extent of it. 

On one of my bicycles (a 2012 Trek Madone 4.7), when climbing very steep hills, I have had problems with the front wheel coming off the ground. This creates an extremely dangerous situation because when this happens one loses all steering control. Do I have any recourse beyond choosing a less steep route, getting less fat (catch 22), or using a different bicycle?
