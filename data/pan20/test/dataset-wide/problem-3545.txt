The problem with body weight exercises In the world of free weights, you have something called a one-rep max (ORM) which defines the maximum amount of weight you can lift at your current level of strength. Using the ORM you can calculate the intensity of any workout with a simple formula, which if I recall correctly is . What's noteworthy here is that if you want to adjust the intensity of your workout, you can either adjust the reps or the weights (or both). This makes tweaking and fine-tuning the intensity of a workout quite easy, and by extension it greatly reduces the need for a pyramid program. However, in the world of body weight (BW) exercises, things are completely different. By removing ORM and weights from the equation, the only way to increase the intensity for any particular workout is to increase the number of reps. If I want to improve my strength and disrupt homeostasis, my only option is to do more reps than I did in the previous workout. At this point the problem should be transparent: you can only increase the number of reps for so long before you hit a plateau. This is why the pyramid approach exists and is so effective for BW exercises: because it makes it easier for you to increase the total number of reps per exercise and break through plateaus. The specific factors that contribute to this programs effectiveness are: Beginner friendly BW exercises can be extremely anti-novice due to their high starting weight versus FW where you can start with as low as 1 lb weights. A beginner doing push-ups to exhaustion may only be able to do 2-3 reps per set, and as a result an increase in intensity becomes exponentially harder in the beginning stages. In the above example, simply adding 1 rep would end up being a 33-50% increase in intensity. Pyramid address this by dispersing the added reps across many sets, for example 4/1/3/2/2 instead of 4/4/exhaust and give up. Increased intensity Let's say you do 4 sets of 5 push-ups, where 5 is your exhaustion point. How do you increase intensity? You have to go to 6, but doing so would be a 20% increase in intensity, quite a large gap to jump. Perhaps this gap is so large that you can not jump it by simply staying at 4x5 to build strength. Doing 4x5 might only be enough to increase your strength by 15%, not the 20% needed, and now you're at a point where doing 4x5 is no longer enough to disrupt homeostasis and build muscle; you need to increase the intensity to do so (catch-22!). This is why the pyramid program exists, because it allows you to increase the intensity of BW exercises at a quicker but more manageable pace, and thus build strength faster. Less frustrations If you are stuck on a certain rep for a long enough time, psychological barriers can come into play that convince your body not to go past that rep, regardless of whether or not you are able to. By taking intensity increases in smaller and more manageable chunks, you will hit fewer walls and be less frustrated with your progress. As a result, psychological barriers will be far less significant of a factor in your progression. 

What chest exercises are available for people who don't have access to a pull-up bar or a bench/barbell? Are there any specific exercises that stand out as extremely good? 

How dangerous is arching your back while doing a bench press? I've seen tons of guys in the gym who greatly arch their back off the bench, assumedly to assist with the lift. Is this bad, or just an alternate form? 

The first thing to know when creating a strength training program is that you need to work out all of the muscle groups to prevent injury or an awkwardly proportioned body (you don't want to look like the Hulk up top when you look like a stick figure down below). This being the case, there are two ways you can approach building a workout routine: 

Weight gain is only one of the many negative results from soda consumption. Sodas can increase insulin levels causing obesity, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Additionally, if the soda contains high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) it is not processed in the same way traditional sugar is processed because HFCS affects (or rather bypasses) the reptin receptors in your brain which regulate satiety. Other negative effects include depleted calcium making bones weaker, hyperactivity, and caffeine dependence. 

Muscle size and strength both come as a result of strength training through the process of hypertrophy. With any type of strength training exercise you will see increases in both size and strength, though to varying degrees depending on the muscle worked and the type of exercise. 

When you are talking about legs, there is only one word that matters: squat. It is the one exercise to rule them all. Start my simply doing body weight (BW) squats. If you cannot do that, then start by doing mobility stretches to address any areas preventing you from doing a proper BW squat. The focus here should be teaching your body the movement, and practicing good form (e.g. to parallel, straight back, etc.) After you are able to comfortably do BW squats WITH PROPER FORM, then it is time to start adding weights. You want to start LIGHT and then progressively add small increments each workout. You can add weight by ideally using a barbell and doing back squats where you add 5lb each workout. Less ideal would be doing goblet squats with a dumbbell. By starting low and then building up slowly, you allow for the muscular imbalances to correct themselves over time without putting strain on the muscle. With all that being said, it always pays to consult a physical therapist. I am a random stranger on the internet, they are a certified and trained professional who can actually examine your body and pinpoint the issues (whereas the best we can do is guess). 

Definitely cut the sugary snacks, and focus on getting a well-rounded diet established. The linked article at the top goes into explicit detail on this subject and has a lot of great advice. Once again, I suggest you commit with the 500 excess calories/day to optimize your gains for the program, and then shift your diet afterwards to be more focused on fat loss (500 day deficit + cardio). 

There are actually two schools of thought on this. For a long time, spot reduction has been (and still is) considered to be a myth because the body burns fat systemically (whole body, as opposed to localized). Up until recently, I myself thought this was true. If the body burns fat systemically, then it is the body that will determine where it pulls fat from, regardless of the muscle that you workout. However, recent studies have begun to suggest otherwise. Cold fat does not mobilize well, so by warming it up (increasing blood flow to the area) you are assisting your body with mobilizing and eliminating those fat cells. Other studies have demonstrated that blood flow and lipolysis increased in the subcutaneous fatty tissue that is directly adjacent to the working muscle. In other words, the study showed that working out specific muscles increased the fat loss in that area. Whether this new science is right, and spot reduction is real, is up to you to decide. It just helps to know that there are multiple schools of thought, so keep an open mind. Sources: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

I don't think there could be more appropriate URL citations than what I am about to provide: how to look like Daniel Craig [nerdfitness.com] and the James Bond workout [menshealth.com]. Granted these are from 2009 when Daniel Craig was preparing for Casino Royale--not Skyfall which I suspect you are referring to--however I would say the advice is even more important because it covers his transition from absolute beginner to "Bond." Essentially, Daniel Craigs workout was a circuit of: 

*Everyone has a different body, and what works for some may not work for others. I personally opted for long rests in this challenge because I never do HIIT or interval training, and exclusively do 60s+ rest in between heavy barbell lifts. This may not be the case for you, so do what your body tells you to do. In contrast the author of the t-nation article mentioned taking frequent breaks and not overextending. Different people require different approaches. 

Actually, soda can contain aspartame, HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup), phosphoric acid, caffeine, and/or empty calories, all of which are a lot more dangerous than generic sugar water. 

Starting off, you'll want to only do 2-3 full body workouts every week, depending on your desired intensity level. You'll also want to put a day or two of rest in between each workout so your muscles have time to recover. 

In the context of your question, this provides us with little help. The fact that you will, at some point, fully recover is not to say that you are fully recovered as of this present moment. In fact, considering that your original question included the wording "my wrist still feels weak" leads me to believe that you are not, in fact, fully recovered from the injury. For athletes, the most important thing to prevent reinjury is allowing for full recovery before becoming fully active. This brings me to my first recommendation: Ask a doctor I cannot stress how important it is to solicit professional medical advice when dealing with an injury. Go back to your doctor and ask their opinion. Additionally, I'd recommend going one step further and consult with a physical therapist who would probably be a lot more knowledgeable about both recovery and prevention. Physiotherapy Like I said, you should consult with a physical therapist if you wish to fully recover from this injury. This is especially important when crafting a exercise recovery plan, as some wrist exercises may be well-suited for others but not for yourself. If, for whatever reason, you cannot engage a PT to assist, here are some starting points that I'd recommend: 

To condense down what Robin said: no, you cannot determine how much weight you will gain based off of strength gains. While you may be able to calculate it theoretically, in a practical sense it would not be worth your time or effort. That being said, I would go even further and make the argument that this is not something you should even care about. More precisely, as a rock climber, a pound of muscle mass gained is a Good Thing (tm) and something that you should be actively pursuing, not trying to avoid. The physical and cardiovascular gains from strength training will more than make up for the increased body weight burden during rock climbing. Final note: it isn't a dumb question if you learn something from it :) 

I have some extremely tight upper back muscles that seemingly no amount of stretching can loosen. What are some alternate or supplemental approaches I can take to loosen tight muscles outside of the typical stretch routine? 

Once again, the answer is yes and no. Strictly speaking, no you cannot because the very act of strength training causes hypertrophy which increases both the size and quantity of the myofibrils which in effect increases the size and strength of your muscle. Additionally, this once again depends on how you define strength, because in muscles there is a marked difference between strength and endurance, though both are equally valid metrics for measuring strength. All that being said, there are ways you can largely focus on one versus the other, and it brings me back to issue of slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers. Training for strength EDIT: There are two schools of thought for building muscle strength without mass. The first school of thought, which I recommended earlier, focuses on doing endurance exercises which are low intensity with high repetition. You stick to the 13-20 rep range, as opposed to the 6-12 rep range which is most common in strength training. Doing this will increase both strength and mass, but with a focus on endurance. The second school of thought revolves around doing very low volume of 1-5 reps such that you are toning and firming the muscle (via generating actin and myosin cross filaments), but you don't stress the muscles so much that you trigger hypertrophy. I haven't seen any studies on this and it directly contradicts what I've held as popular belief, so hopefully someone with more knowledge might be able to shed some light here. *One final note: it is important that you consider the distinction between body mass and muscle mass. For instance, you could conceivably build muscle strength and muscle mass in your arms, all while reducing your arms overall mass by reducing excess fat. Just something to consider. 

Get your own squat rack for your house. Clean the bar from the floor. Get a spotter to help you. Use the bench press barbell rack so you are only cleaning from waist up. Use the steinborn lift. 

I cannot overstate how important these points are. Having a baseline of strength is the most important thing you can do to improve your ability to do push ups. Once you establish that baseline, you will then need to start training your body with specificity and frequent practice so it can adapt to doing push ups in the 100+ range. Both steps are important, as are the order you approach them. Once you have the physical strength and endurance necessary, then you can shift your focus to optimizing your approach. Follow these steps to optimize your 4 minutes: 

In your beginner phase you have the most explosive growth, both in lifts and in muscle; however this is not a linear growth, as there is a definite upper limit in which your growth tapers off as you come closer to your genetic potential. This brings us back to what I was saying earlier about the "optimal" approach. As a beginner you have such explosive growth that you get away with the less-than-optimal, but as an advanced lifter you are so close to your upper limit that you have to finely tune your program, meaning you have to go through the bulking and cutting cycles. 

Your list has a lot of "less" but that information is worthless. You could be eating less rice meals but replacing the rice with potatoes or another similar food. It doesn't matter what you are eating less of, it matters what you are actually eating. Don't get me wrong, cutting out certain items like rice or sodas is a great first step to cutting calories, because they can facilitate overeating. But at the end of the day, it is still totally possible to overeat even without those items in your diet. If you want to lose fat, the first step is to calculate your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), which represents the total amount of calories your body burns in a 24 hour period. TDEE includes everything from sleeping, light exercising, working, and more. Once you have a good understanding of what your body burns in a day, the next step is to eat less than that amount. By eating fewer calories than your body can burn, you force it to pull from your fat (and muscle) stores to convert them into energy needed. Since I am unfamiliar with your body composition, age, and other relevant statistics, I won't go suggesting a particular calorie deficit for you to use. That being said, anywhere from 100-500 calories deficit per day is a good zone to aim for depending on your particular circumstances.
