Image from Yongyun Hu and Jun Yang, PNAS 111 629–634 (2013), doi: 10.1073/pnas.1315215111 You can notice on this Figure from meteorological model od Hu & Yang that the substellar point is not the hottest place, thanks to the wind. The hottest places are two points just above and below it. However, if Earth got tidally locked, the Coriolis force would be almost non-existent and the most dominant feature would be air rising at substellar point and near-ground winds moving towards it. (There some videos exploring this scenario 1, 2, 3, although not the wind pattern itself.) This situation was described in Vincent's and PipperChips answers. Do not miss: The transition from wind pattern of slow rotating planets without Coriolis force and quickly rotating planets of red dwarfs is nicely illustrated in Oceaniis' post at the Forum of Speculative Evolution. Interesting source is also this post at the SpaceEngine forum. Interesting source for deeper study is also thesis of R. A. Edson. 

Local features Mountains Apart from the global circulation of the atmosphere, there is lot of local features, that can create deserts, for example. In my opinion, one should roughly imagine where the clouds are coming from and where do they go. Clouds appear above oceans, the warmer the region, the more clouds appear. Then, they follow the prevailing direction of winds. (See the discussion above.) If there are high mountains between, there will be a lot of precipitation on the side from where the clouds go, and dry region, possibly desert, after that. Continents The water slowly rains away above the land. Hundreds or thousands of kilometers in the middle of large continent, there will be a dry region with big temperature differences between summer and winter. (Or even within one day for slowly rotating planets.) This might go to extremes for large continents. 

I'm going to add this as an answer instead of commenting as it touches on different topics, particularly the fact that modern infantry isn't fighting in a lot of wide open areas like in the past. An urban environment is what was mentioned and doesn't seem to have been focused on enough. 

The obvious answer to me is to put them to work. You say that the government doesn't have the money to sustain the very large population of new citizens, but the question there is why? If it is due to lack of food, portion off some of the clones to food development. If it is lack of housing, then you teach some of them to build homes and such. Pretty much the only real issue that might be truly limiting would be space, but considering they managed to house the clones during the war, plus there is no doubt a decent number of casualties from the war, then there should be enough space for them to live. This might entail some social changes such as group housing or building more vertically, but it should still be able to be done. By having the clones trained and doing the work to support themselves, the burden is eased on the government to figure it all out. Plus you get the bonus of keeping all of these likely trained killers under watch and busy doing something productive rather than deciding to go off and conquer a land area of their own. 

One possible approach how to estimate extend of space colonization is to define costs of it and then estimate the investments the governments and organizations would be willing to pay. In an excellent analysis of starship costs on the Rocketpunk Manifesto blog, the author shows that currently, the cost of building the International Space Station is \$170 millions per metric ton, and if we are very, very optimistic, the building price of space ships could be comparable to building price of a modern airplane, approximately \$1.2 millions per metric ton. My question is: What is a reasonable estimate of building price and annual maintenance cost of a long-term working colony on a planet without breathable atmosphere, like Moon or Mars, per metric ton of the colony mass? What is a reasonably optimistic estimate how low could these prices fall once the technology is established? Do not include the transport costs, only the costs of building the colony itself. 

Please note that the prefactor $6 × 10^{10}$ currently used on Wikipedia is very probably wrong, so I provided a more realistic one. (See the discussion.) The tidal locking is approximately exponential process, so it is very quick at the beginning and gradually slows down. Typical situation is, that planets in the habitable zone are tidally locked for red dwarf stars. Moons are very often tidally locked, unless they are very far from their planet. 

Basically, gorillas are better for the exact opposite of what you're wanting them to do, which is fight in tight, modern, urban environments for a simple reason, they're animals and don't live or operate in these areas naturally. If you wanted melee soldiers for an older style of fighting in mountainous terrain, then they'd be great, but for this I would say no. 

Personally, I would avoid the cannon idea. Cannons were used on ocean going vessels because it could cause them to sink when they took enough damage to their wooden hulls. Causing hull damage to an airship is not the most efficient way to solve the problem. I propose the idea of some of the other early weapons such as ballistae. With sufficient force, this could be much more damaging to an airship than a blunt cannonball. It could be made to penetrate several gas bags and it should fit the technology level that you are aiming for without hand-waving like a rocket would. If you do prefer to stick with cannons, which I also don't like due to recoil, I would consider something like chain-shot that could also be used to do more penetration based damage rather than bludgeoning. 

Experience - you describe a scenario where you take already grown gorillas and hand wave them into being intelligent. That's all well and good if you want to educate them to show off at an academic conference, but that is a horrible idea for a soldier. What you are really doing is creating the equivalent of physically superior child soldiers because they have almost zero life experience to draw upon as soldiers. They won't know even the basics about human life and our habitats and teaching this combined with everything else that they need to know to be effective soldiers in an urban environment would take years. Otherwise they'll simply be brawny thugs shooting anything that resembles what you have qualified as a 'bad guy' and most likely being tactically outmaneuver very quickly. Cost - Human soldiers have been the focus for our infantry for thousands of years. Unless you're planning to have had these intelligent gorillas around for a long time, then nothing will have been developed over time to suit them, it will have been adapted for them, and that is a problem. You even mention creating a new kind of 'foot' wear just for these new troops, along with modifications to other equipment. That is simply the beginning, as others pointed out, because they have not evolved for acting as humans do. If this organization decides to suddenly attempt this gorilla soldier idea, then it is going to cost them a ton to get what is likely very little return out of it. 

Imagine there is a country in which there are all important natural resources (oil, gas, metal ores, wood, etc.) in their natural form and which lies in a temperate climate region. There may be some portion of a sea. The country is completely isolated from the rest of the world - nothing (except for air, precipitation, etc.) can get in or out. What is the minimum population and size of the country to sustain a developed industrial society? (All the technology used there has to be produced somewhere in the country eventually.) The technology level is current. (Year 2014, realistic technologies that can be mass-produced with reasonable cost.) By other words: What is the minimum amount of people and land to produce self-sustained agriculture and all relevant factories that are necessary for complete self sufficiency in industry from mining all ores to producing the final devices? Consider that people need to be educated and not all are geniuses that can be educated to the cutting-edge technology expert levels. EDIT: You can assume the technology is initially present, it does not have to be invented, but next generation must be able to learn it and understand it. (For example people have a very good library, or computer database, as long as the computers are running.) 

The theory of Late Heavy Bombardment says that approximately 4 billions of years ago, something disturbed the orbits of asteroids in the Kuiper belt, which caused extremely heavy bombardment of Earth by asteroids. This probably brought many heavy elements to Earth's surface. The heavy elements that were here previously, during the Earth's formation, sank to the core when the Earth was liquid which made them out of reach. In other words, if there was no Late Heavy Bombardment, the surface of Earth might have been almost without elements much heavier than silicon. (Iron, gold, silver, platinum and others would be extremely rare.) My question: If humans developed the same way they did, what kind of technology would be achievable almost without elements much heavier than silicon? 

I think this is where fascism could help (the emperor, not the people). This is similar to exactly what happened to Japan before the world war. The emperor has to tell the people that the dignity of the country and the self-respect of the people are both directly related to the wishes of the crown. Because at the end of the day, that is what a monarch is, right? All you need is to make a political party (assuming democracy) or another institution that relies on the monarch. Once the monarch gains enough power, a starwars type "crisis" could do the trick. In a war, the monarch can get emergency powers that could also give him enough power over the army. Then it is just a matter of time before the monarch could put loyal people in key positions to overthrow the previous government and gain power. For an ordinary person, all the steps are very hard, but for a monarch that has cultural influence over the people and is the symbol of national identity, this might be easier (not saying that it would be easy though). PS: I had love to discuss this case even further in the comments………… 

If the country has aircraft carriers, there is more or less nothing the rebels could do to prevent the nazis from pounding their homes. (Otherwise, the navy would not be of much concern) The government has nuclear weapons that could instantly kill all the rebel settlements. 

Gravitational force field on the torus surface. Inner side of the torus is right, outer side is left. It may be counter-intuitive that the potential energy is equal on the whole surface, but the gravity strength is changing. Equal potential energy only means that the force always points into the surface and walking around does not require work. But the gravitational force will change. It is strongest inside the torus where the centrifugal and the gravitational forces add up. It is weakest at the outside, where they subtract. Results The most important result is that if you precisely balance the gravitational and the centrifugal force, the toroidal planet can indeed be stable. The planet must rotate very quickly, otherwise it will collapse to a sphere. In this case once in 2.65 hours. Other parameters valid for my planet are listed below, but there can probably be many others that work as well. 

Different cultures, religions or political opinions, according to the authors, stress different foundations, but they are always present to some extent. 

Alternative viewpoint: Maybe we shouldn't assert that behavior of aliens is in all situations so different from ours. Aliens, if they are evolved creatures like us, probably evolved their psychology to best serve evolution strategy they need. We can notice that dogs, for example, behave not so differently from us. Probably because they are pack animals, same as we are. Cats on the other hand, are solitary predators, and they may be quite inscrutable - their evolutionary strategy is different than ours. There is interesting (although very speculative) hypothesis how our psychology and morality is shaped by our evolutionary origins. It is called Moral Foundations Theory (more here and here). It assumes that morality of almost any society of humans contains elements of five pillars, which have quite clear evolutionary origin: 

I recommend that you take a look into Esperanto. It is a language that was an actual real-life attempt to create almost exactly what you are describing. It uses the Latin/Roman script popular to most of the Western European languages as well as English and utilizes a vocabulary similar to that of the Romantic and Germanic languages. It is said to be easier to learn than English and has actually been growing in popularity and usage for the past few decades. This answers the first part of your question. $URL$ For the second part, I think the best way for the government to try and institute a change would be through passive action. By simply making all communication with them use the new language, they are basically forcing you to learn it to some degree. Unfortunately, in answer to your third question, as you will discover, it is very difficult to get people to give up their language as that is a very core and defining part of who we are. Even if the government demands it, you still end up with people simply adopting the new language as a secondary to their own. Short of taking a very aggressive approach and simply squashing all resistance, it is unlikely that real change will happen. History says that you will more likely experience revolution and resistance from the nation's citizens. 

Now, because the Government uses extensive brainwashing, the people in the army would not help the rebels or have a conscience (to a large extent, like in the case of Germany or modern day communist countries). Can you provide hypothetical solutions to these two problems? Are there historical evidences (of rebels against nuclear armed government, or rebels destroying aircraft carriers)? A win is defined as a case in which the rebels manage to reach at least a stalemate and could recommence living in peace. 

In an anti-gun debate (I was pro-gun, which is relevant), I used the example of an hypothetical ex-democracy which allowed guns (like the US) and then turned authoritarian with theological brainwashing (let's say Christian Nazis, religion is irrelevant). The Jews, which form a substantial part of the population are now in the center of a genocide. A resistance is now made by the Jewish population, which now has near 100 percent gun ownership due to past laws (thus this will not happen with the gun laws). To beat the army, the shear number of active fighting rebels is obviously enough, even though the rebels' guns are relatively primitive. The artillery could also be destroyed using home-made bombs. Land based air-force could be rendered useless as the rebels capture airbases. Now, I start losing the debate with two major loopholes in my argument:
