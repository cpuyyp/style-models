Unfortunately for the supercomputing bacteria, worshipers build things that the worshipers think is useful, not what the god itself wants. Even specific orders, like Yahweh commanding the ark of the covenant or the Temple of Solomon ends up more "inspiring" their charge the right direction, not providing detailed plans. So, without tools, what would semi-intelligent cuttlefish and octopi make for their gods? Ink clouds and structures of mucus. First off, they don't have tools, so they'll need to figure something out without being able to build things with tooling. They would be thinking of things useful to them... while also constructing things which bring themselves pleasure (because most temples are designed to wow their followers as well). Ink clouds, shaped into specific forms as they dissipate would be a beautiful, if pointless to their gods, form of worship; the brain's own "numinous" circuits would reward the animals for producing these beautiful forms. Structures of mucus, however, would be way more useful to the bacteria in building films and other organized structures. They could manipulate the religious sensibilities of the critters to make the macro-structures in the form they require, while handling the lower level stuff themselves. 

Modern names are easy: grab a phone book. Libraries usually have copies of the local White Pages (I'm so old. Phone books and libraries.) But you can just flip through the index and find all kinds of names. When I need names from another country, I'll go to that country's Wikipedia page and look up something like $URL$ Grab some big political body, and pick a random first and last name, and you'll end up with a "typical" popular name from the last half decade or so. 

Yep, we have a history of just that: The American Mafia during Prohibiton To have corporations engage in military conflict, you need: 

Why would a scheming, greedy, profits-driven opportunist ever educate their children? Education costs money and resources and risk revolution; much better to impress a basic trade skill on your children and lock them into indentured servitude to the family. (The Ferengi have been mentioned to do something like this). You want your slaves to be just intelligent enough to speak and do their menial tasks, but not so intelligent that they have second thoughts about their rightful place in the grand scheme of things (in a dingy factory, pulling levers). Children would be born prolifically, probably in vats or some other bulk-production system, as the only employees these merchantilists* would have full control over, for their entire lives, are family members. So, to answer the question directly: The Volto educate their children by brutal example (natural selection). Many of their children will just make the best out of it that they can, learning quickly that pulling the lever faster gets one some minor increase in benefits (closer to an air vent, or a less-squeaky lever). Strong arming other workers into pulling their levers faster gets one a promotion to Supervisor and a plasma whip. They'll naturally learn to use their brute force to take what they need. Supervisors who don't punish their crews enough will be demoted back into ranks, where the next Supervisor will literally whip them into shape. Supervisors who are too brutal will decrease the productivity of their crew, and likely be terminated. The harsh (plasma pistol) firing will serve as a lesson to other Supervisors. And some of those children, maybe one out of every vat-load, will be born with extra intelligence. When a Volto parent discovers one of their children organizing the other children into working for them (think Tom Sawyer, not labor union type organization), they pull that kid out of the mines and move him or her into Management (before they damage the Prole worldview too much). The ability to manipulate their fellows without force, but with the invisible hand of economic theory would be taught to them, on the job. They'll learn, or they'll go back to the mines, and their bretheren will be all too happy to get their hands on the "suit" who reduced their water rations to save on repair parts for the water pumps. This, in fact, will be the biggest weapon used by the Management class against their own staff: do what I tell you to do or you go back to the mines to die at the hands of the Proles. Life in Management is a swift learning experience because your life is one check-mark on a form away from ending brutally at the hands of your oppressed under-family. One will learn how to manipulate their fellows, wring every drop of profit out of their under-family, and backstab each other to gain rank or cover their butts. Only the most backstabby, vile members of the family will survive to be a Parent, the C-levels of society. Many will fail back into the mines as scapegoats or victims of purges, some will settle in the middle ranks as a headcount, doing just enough to keep their berth and having so little motivation for upward advancement that their supervisors never have to kill them off for safety. And those with the best biological makeup to be the scum of the scum will be the only members with enough pull to make it to the C-Level and become part of the next vat's gene pool, thereby building those features in to their family's DNA. Proles mate with Proles to fill out the working class, and C-levels mate with C-levels to increase the efficiency of the Management class. (* Many writers make the mistake of having uber-evil Capitalists, but that falls apart, as many features of Capitalism run contrary to the very overbearing, backwards minded concepts of these societies. For an example, take Star Trek: DS9. The Ferengi didn't even let their females wear clothing, and consigned them to the house, thereby pre-emptively shutting down half of the workforce (and half of the available market for goods! Women not buying clothing?! I couldn't not buy shoes!) A whole season's worth of Quark episodes surrounded the Ferengi Grand Nagus turning into a banking and industry genius, only for Quark to find out that his mother was the actual intelligence behind the throne! All those middle managers, marketing executives, and (yes) shuttle mechanics being forcefully excluded from the market? That's not Capitalism! That's more like Mercantilism. Keep your resources internal. Exploit your workers to the bone. Refuse imports, focus on exports. Your aliens are more Mercantillist than Capitalist. Just a little detail to write in.) 

Religion by it's very nature is prone to schisms. There are no examples of a religion on earth of any longevity that hasn't split and factionalized. This is such a common phenomena that it's possible that it is a fundamental part of human nature. If it's impossible for religions on one earth to not split constantly. It's going to be impossible for a religion spanning multiple earths to do so. To quote xkcd: 

Latitude, longitude and a date. This way your future self can decide what is the optimal place to send you based on future information. This is going to be somewhat pricy to set up. GPS coordinates require two 64 bit values to be set up properly. You could use a 32 bit value to represent Unix time but that will overflow in the year 2038. It's best to use 64 bits for time just to be safe. You could shave off bits by truncating values or using nonstandard formatting. Just be sure that you clearly document these decisions. You only have one shot at this. 

If the humans have the same structure in their eyes, which can be assumed by the fact that they are genetically compatible, the color of the sun should have no effect on their perception of the world. There might be cultural differences based on what colors are significant important on either world. But that affect is more a function of culture/language than it is a function of the star itself. For example in English we have consider red and pink to be distinct colors. While other languages don't consider pink to be a distinct color and would refer to the colors we call pink as light red. 

The premise of the movie The Purge is focused on individual acts of violence. These tend to be personally tragic but when you are talking about millions of people the death of any one is insignificant. The real threat to society of 12 hours without law is the ability to violate laws that protect people at scale. People would be able to make a business of collecting and storing toxic waste and rapidly dumping it during the purge. This would result in the mass poisoning of rivers without any recourse available for anyone who lives downstream. It only takes a moment to coordinate insider trading, or conspire to commit a future crime. These crimes would have massive effects outside of the intended 12 hour period. All import restrictions wouldn't be enforced allowing anyone to buy anything. There would be a line of trucks at the border ready to drive a years worth of drugs into the country without any law enforcement to stop them. Want to sell weapons to terrorists? As long as the deal is complete within 12 hours it's all good. 

1500 years ago old english was just starting to be a distinct. Now it's mutually unintelligible with the its modern form and the languages it's closest related to. That's with 1500 years of close contact, trade, and diplomacy between each language. It stands to reason that if you want your much more isolated settlements to be unable to speak to each other that's an entirely plausible assumption. It could also be possible that much less linguistic drift happened, medieval Icelandic manuscripts can still be read today by modern speakers of the language. Pick what makes sense for your story between these two extremes. 

Spacesuits are designed to keep an individual pressurized in a low pressure environment. What you are looking for is something along the lines of an atmospheric diving suit. They are designed to keep a individual at a much lower pressure than the surrounding environment. It's likely that the suit could be a lot less bulky than a diving hardsuit because the pressure differential is much lower between Earth and Mars than between sea level and 700m below sea level. 

Cellulose is a very good terrestrial structural molecule. Very popular in forests. It can create large structures in a massive variety of shapes. Unfortunately fungi don't use cellulose as a structural molecule. You could wave your hands a bit and say that they do but there's another more plausible option. Chitin is a polymer based off glucose with a similar structure to cellulose. Mushrooms already produce it. If we're imagining a forest of Morrowind style giant mushrooms. We can ever so slightly wave our hands and say that they use chitin to give them their structure similar to how plants use cellulose. 

The Ozone layer protects us from UVB radiation, which is the point of this question. The big difficulty in answering this question is summed up by a 2007 study by the University of Ottawa to the US Department of Health and Human Services: there's not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure that imposes minimal risk of skin cancer. (Abstract Additionally, there's no conclusive evidence that UVB is actually carcinogenic; we label the whole spectrum as "carcinogenic." We're relatively certain that they are all carcinogens, but we don't know for sure (Paper) This makes it hard to put a number to the amount of Ozone needed. Human skin color correlates well with the UV radiation available to a group of people over long time scales; Peoples around the equator tend to have higher pigmentation levels; in the rainforest they have middle range pigmentation, and near the poles a lack of significant pigmentation. For "human survival" it would depend on the length of time available for the colony to become adapted to the UV, perhaps over the course of many, many generations. One thing to remember is that UV is not ionizing radiation. It doesn't chew through the length of the body, knocking bits around. UV causes damage to surfaces through chemical interactions; the skin and eyes would be vulnerable. Another missing detail in the question: are human like species expected to evolve on this planet, or are we talking about a human colony landing? If it's a human colony landing, the answer is "Zero Ozone." Simple fact of the matter is, because UV only damages surfaces, you can have UV filtering goggles and clothing that reflects UV covering all skin surfaces, and you are fine. This depends on humans evolving elsewhere and arriving on the planet with no ozone, but it's surviviable. This would also allow the humans to use construction materials to build domes and filters for food crops which would be damaged by high levels of UV. If you want life to evolve on this planet into human like critters, that's a vastly different story. UV isn't ionizing, so it doesn't plow through structures; but it's powerful enough to punch right through single celled organisms, and we kinda need those for life to evolve. I've failed to find information about the UV absorption of sea water, but life finds a way, right? So it'd probably start at the deep sea vents, scaled critters could come up to higher levels in the ocean because the scales protect their skin, which would allow them to leave the oceans for the land, and evolve into feathered and hairy beings. But then we get to a problem; it's believed that humans evolved hairlessness because our environment and new bipedal posture made wearing fur cause problems with cooling the body; we shed the fur so we could sweat more efficiently. On a high UV planet, however, it's likely that human type critters wouldn't be able to lose their fur, or would have to replace it with something else. But this whole line of thought, while fun to follow, is moot. High powered mobile animals like us require oxygen as part of our respiration cycle. The Ozone layer is moderated by the incoming Ozone itself; higher levels of Ozone react with the Oxygen in the atmosphere to create new O3; that O3 gets knocked apart by UV which forms more O2 or more O3. It's a self-regenerating process. So any planet with enough oxygen to support animals will likely have an ozone layer adequate to control the majority of harmful UV radiation. The concern with the ozone hole was the fear that we humans were emitting chemistry in the air which destroyed O3 faster than UV radiation could create it, disrupting the balance and allowing through more radiation. This is unlikely to be a problem on a pre-industrial world, and post-industrial societies have plenty of methods available to reduce one's exposure to high UV radiation, and to protect their pets, livestock, and crops. TL;DR: the answer is "Zero" To have humans who look like us, we need an Ozone layer similar to the one on Earth; the lack of ozone wouldn't destroy the ability for life to evolve, but it would cause it to follow a completely different path, and therefore would not be a "human society." Humans landing on the planet will be able to shield themselves from the increased UV simply; the only technology required is the ability to make cloth and UV filtering glass, which any space-based society should be able to produce.
