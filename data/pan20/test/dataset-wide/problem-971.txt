Could be Jet which is a mineralised form of coal, it also reminds me of several pieces of salt mineralised charcoal I have that I found on beaches in New Zealand. 

I can't be definite but my three best guesses are Travertine, Agate and maybe Halite, if it fizzes in mild acid it's Travertine, a form of Limestone, if it dissolves in hot water it's Halite, or Rocksalt, otherwise if it's more or less inert it's probably Agate, an amorphous silicate. I find Halite unlikely, the other two are probably pretty equally likely in that location. 

I'm curious about how much is known about this topic: how much has the total amount of life on Earth changed over the 4 billion years or so that it has existed on this planet? Are there estimates of global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), or biomass, or both, for previous geological epochs? If so, how certain are these estimates, and what assumptions are they based on? If the total figures are thought to have changed much in the past, what are the main factors thought to cause these changes? Conversely, if the totals are thought to have been relatively stable, what are the main feedbacks that are thought to have ensured this? 

1 part per billion is 1x10^-9 kilograms per kilogram so to convert a kilogram per kilogram ratio into a parts per billion figure divide it by 1x10^-9. 

As a rule no, while sulfur and nitrogen compounds from industrial and vehicle exhaust have an immediate impact and a relatively fast deposition cycle and thus are extremely location sensitive carbon dioxide is relatively long lived in the atmosphere and too plentiful in discharge to be heavily effected by the environment of discharge, assuming direct atmospheric discharge. If you pumped carbon dioxide discharge into water instead of the air then the atmospheric concentrations would be greatly effected by location, specifically temperature and algal uptake rates. 

Earth, Titan and Venus all have large amounts of $\mathrm{N_2}$ in their atmospheres. (In the case of Venus it's a small proportion, but Venus' atmosphere is very thick, and the total mass of $\mathrm{N_2}$ is greater than Earth's.) However, other planets and moons, and Mars in particular, have hardly any. Why is this? $\mathrm{N_2}$ is a relatively light molecule, so I suppose it could be lost to space from smaller bodies. Did Mars start with a thick nitrogen atmosphere and then lose it? Or alternatively, is there some process that produced lots of $\mathrm{N_2}$ on Earth, Titan and Venus, which didn't occur on Mars or the other outer Solar system moons? If so, what is this process likely to be? 

Not one that I can immediately see, in order to derive a per cubic metre figure (m^-3) you need to know how many cubes of soil you have in a given column unit, that requires the depth of the unit in question. 

I know in New Zealand we have a number of soils you can't raise dairy herds on because the nitrate in their urine strips too many nutrients too fast, to the point where one can tell where the cow urinated a couple of weeks ago because that patch of grass is dying from several different deficiencies simultaneously. My understanding is that dairy cows are, hands-down, the worst farm animal for this because they stand still when voiding and dump up to 15 litres of moderate-high nitrate liquid waste at a time which all goes effective straight down through the soil column robbing it of nutrients along the way. On the other hand there are also some soils, generally in more arid areas, where nitrate doesn't migrate right through the soil column at all but concentrates in the subsoil as a visible, white, salty, horizon. As a rule the more water retentive the soil the longer water soluble compounds like nitrate will take to work down into the ground at a given water input. There are also some chemical interactions that will bind nitrate and slow it down more than you might expect we need study them in my soil fertility papers but I can't think what they are right now. But to answer your question, usually soluble soil ions (which nitrate is) move on a timescale of days, weeks or maybe months, but not decades. We wouldn't need to apply slow-release nitrate fertilisers annually if it didn't migrate through at least the top-soil relatively rapidly. 

I suppose the difference is that these are on the surface of a comet, which, unlike the Moon, is geologically active. These are hardly what you'd call mountains - the whole nucleus is only 4km long, so the features shown must be hundreds of metres in size at best. But still, I would imagine freshly formed mountains would look something like this in the absence of erosion. It never rains but it pours. Here is a glorious photo of mountains on Pluto from NASA's New Horizons mission, from September 2015. Pluto is another (surprisingly) geologically active world, with apparently little erosion. These ones really are mountains, about three kilometres in height. They are probably made of water ice rather than rock, which is very hard at those temperatures. They also apprear very jagged.

Folk and Ward (1957) were the ones who created a measure of sorting using graphical moments of particle size distribution based upon φ values obtained graphically from the cumulative frequency curve at specific percentile levels. I wasn't aware that negative values were possible based on the equation, but I am not up on my sedimentology.. Assuming your value is correct, it would signify extremely well sorted material: the Inclusive Graphic Standard Deviation (Folk and Ward, 1957) has a phi range of <0.3 (extremely well sorted) to >3.0 (extremely poorly sorted). 

There are a number of publicly available proxy records for sea-level/temperature curves, I'd start with Google Scholar if you want refereed articles but a straight Google search can give you good results if you use the right search terms, like "sea-level over time" gave me some useful results; I'd recommend the Wikipedia result as most useful to you. 

The only thing that's clear from that photo appears to be the colour, if it is as silvery as it looks I'd say it's Galena, Lead(II) Sulfide, you're looking for a specific gravity of about 7.5, Pyrite is only around a 5 and is also a gold colour. It might be Chalcopyrite but that should show some purples in it's colour which don't seem to be present. 

After I asked the question, the Rosetta mission sent back some glorious images of rocks as jagged as those on any science fiction book cover: 

I'm curious about how mountains on an airless world such as the Moon would look if you were standing on the surface and looking at them. There are plenty of artists' impressions, of course, but I'm curious about whether there are any existing photographs of such a scene. From browsing photographs of the Moon landings, there are a few surprisingly rounded-looking low hills on the horizon, but not what you'd call an actual mountain. This makes sense, since the missions targeted large flat areas where it would be safe to land. There are photographs of mountains seen from Lunar orbit, but not from the surface. There are photographs of Mount Sharp from the Curiosity mission to Mars, but Mars has an atmosphere, and to my untrained eye Mount Sharp looks quite eroded. So I'm wondering whether there are any such photos in existence at all - either because a probe has landed on an airless body close enough to a mountain to get a picture, or because a camera in orbit has been aimed at the horizon in order to capture a mountain range from the same angle at which it would be seen from the surface. Alternatively, are there any mountains on Earth where (for whatever reason) erosion hasn't played a big role in shaping them so far, and which therefore look similar to the uneroded mountains one would find on an airless world? 

At thirty to thirty-eight degrees north and south of the equator are the so-called Horse Latitudes, regions with constant high-pressure systems. These regions inhibit precipitation. The phenomenon is quite well described and illustrated on Wikipedia: $URL$ 

As you say in your question, ball lightening and and St Elmo's Fire are related to thunderstorm activity (e.g., Griwr'ev et al, 1991). Grigor’ev et al (1999) worked out a formula for the charge on small drops of water (which is a bit complicated for a simple answer), but suffice to say the total voltage involved is high when you scale from one drop to millions. For example ~30kV per cubic centimetre is in the literature for initiating Ball Lightening, and lower for St Elmo's Fire because the coronal discharge nucleates on pointed or sharp objects. If you troll physics forums about demonstrating St Elmo's fire in a laboratory setting, you'll see that it is actually quite dangerous, due to the high voltage. Most suggestions by physics teachers are to demonstrate the effect in neon gas, rather than air, and within glass bulbs. So one answer to your question is that the effect can be dangerous, e.g., when creating conditions of coronal discharge in an experimental setting. What about in a natural setting? You can read in Griwr'ev et. al (1991) about several hundred reports of St Elmo's Fire sightings, but it isn't mentioned whether anyone has been 'within' the effect. However, St Elmo's Fire was observed on the Hindenburg shortly before it exploded (Robinson, 1964); not that this was the likely 'spark' that caused the explosion, but part of the prelude. I can't find any verified reports of people immersed in St Elmo's Fire during my quick review of published literature, or non-peer reviewed sources like Scientific American and Wikipedia. There is an interesting reference in Wikipedia to Tesla managing to light up some butterflies with one of his coils, though! 

I conclude from this that mountains on active worlds without erosion will generally appear jagged; the smoothness of the Moon's mountains is not due to the absence of erosion - rather, they're smoothed because of erosion, which in the Moon's case is primarily due to micrometeorites and takes place over a very long time. This is possible because the Moon is not geologically active, so its mountains are far older than the ones in the pictures above. Finally, I can't resist editing again to add another image from the Rosetta mission, taking during the spacecraft's final descent before a controlled collision with the comet in September 2016. It's just an incredibly beautiful image. (source)
