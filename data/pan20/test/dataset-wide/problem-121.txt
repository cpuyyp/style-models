What does this mean for the medium on which longer texts--such as books, records, and even personal writings--are written down? I'm very attached to the idea of books and scrolls as I know them, but in the context of this writing system, I can't see how those would form or be useful to the people using them. 

In the world I'm building, there is a race of people whose main shtick is that they can detect the magnetic fields of their planet and use them to navigate. In one of their cultures, the people are nomadic and use the same "roads" to travel to different historic or religious sites in their culture. What's even more interesting is their sense of these lines, which is widely perceived as being innate knowledge. Members of this culture may not know where these paths lead, but their existence is widely known and understood to them, even if they've never followed them far or at all. However, what these ley lines really are has been difficult to pin down. I am essentially looking for a phenomenon that can explain the following traits: 

One of the first things noted about pretty much any humanoid race with horns or antlers is that the neck would not be able to support the weight, making the idea unfeasible. However, some horns are larger than others, and I find it difficult to believe the idea of horned humanoids is entirely not plausible—especially when taking into account that cutaneous horns are a thing. Ignoring how these horns came to be or what their purpose might be, how large could horns resembling animal horns be on an average human without any charges to the current body plans and muscle structure? 

Having recently been to Mammoth Cave National Park, I've been considering the caves of my own worlds, and more specifically their formation. Now while not all caves are formed from limestone, it is the most common cave material, given that water seems to so readily dissolve it. The groundwater drills into the limestone--or other stone depending on the cave system--going where water does by taking the path of least resistance, or in other words, dissolving the less dense stone first, eventually forming what we recognize as caves after the water table recedes enough for the cave network to become more readily accessible. For a more visual representation, see this short, interactive simulation. With that in mind, I would like to be able to simulate the formation of the cave networks in my own worlds, but I don't have massive slabs of limestone on hand nor the time it takes to see how water will form caves within them, which is why I'm looking for a small-scale solution preferably meeting the following requirements: 

Let's give this a stab by starting to appeal to all the conspiracy theorists and consider the first possible time frame "Ground Zero". Along with the black suit syndrome, we don't know the unknown people (organisation X) who would be at G0 seconds before the projectiles (pod and ship) hit their likely calculated impact points (Let's say X has abundant resources and power to remain hidden from us common folk - be as creative as you need ie. able to intercept satellite/government/intelligence etc. to mislead their predictions of the orbital entry or crash). Case X - A: Assume that X somehow had prior knowledge of the existence of the newcomers. If relations were diplomatic -> a search/rescue/recovery and cleanup of evidence would take place (Lots of question about media footage with no answers still preferable to spilled beans). If relations were hostile (ship was possibly compromised by X to begin with) -> cleanup of survivors + evidence. Case X - B: X is just caught off guard like the rest of the world but they still want the information first, and if need be contained. They would likely undergo recon with risk assessment, capture/detain/eliminate hostile survivors. And attempt to clean up the scene. Entering slightly more realistic ground and say X doesn't exist or is otherwise occupied with more pressing concerns. Considering there was ample coverage and warning (uncompromised by X) of the craft's approach, countries or areas expecting the crash in their yard will likely have prepared a military/scientific/media resource at the site. Likely in that order. To first secure the situation and ensure the craft or its passengers pose no immediate aggressive threat. Followed by an investigation into the specifics of the craft/passengers/crash and the environmental threats they could pose. Concluded lastly by allowing/or not the media to disclose details of the event. As to what happens afterwards and who gets custody of the evidence, it's unlikely that a single government could cover up or lay claim to such an event (A claims crash site, B claims orbital entry into their skies, C claims debris, D claims death of civilians... etc.). I suspect a panel/convention/union of countries would be formed with regards to which decisions will be taken. Most likely these decisions will lead to scientific investigation for the most of the foreseeable future. Information released would most likely be that deemed safe enough to release to the public, or that necessary to control and keep the public calm. On a global scale there could be religious turmoil or similar such which would claim to explain the existence of the ship. 

In essence, I am looking for a natural phenomenon or something that could be a widespread phenomenon on some other world to use in this setting that meets most if not all the criteria above. 

What shape would the eggs of a species of oviparous humanoids be? Eggs are common enough that you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn't seen one. While birds' eggs are often thought of more frequently, a wide variety of eggs exist and are in use by various species around the world. However, something worth noting is the shape eggs take on in relation to the parent species and environment. True spheres have no strengths or weaknesses because the pressure applied to one point is distributed evenly across the surface of the object. As anyone who's seen even the roundest eggs will tell you though, eggs are not true spheres. In fact, what most people think of as eggs are more oval in shape. This is believed to prevent them from rolling away--which would occur with truly spherical eggs--while also making it easier to get the eggs out of the body because of the tapered end at the top. However, this phenomenon is not often observed in species that nest in holes or other cavities, whose eggs tend to be more spherical, though this most likely has to do with decreased risk of rolling away in a closed area. With that in mind, I am looking to determine the shape of the eggs that would come from a species with the following traits: 

Related: This question is similar in that is discusses temperature ranges, but it's looking more for answers on how to change the range of thermoregulation for endotherms, rather than figuring out the existing range for ecotherms. This question is also similar, but assumes the knowledge of temperature ranges for their creatures. I am looking to find those numbers. This is a graduated question from the Sandbox 

Most Earth cultures — as far as I know — tend to use square or rectangular surfaces to write upon, and similarly our texts are also organized into square and rectangular shapes. However, a culture that writes in circles (as in all the letters fall along the circumference of an invisible circle) would likely not use squares or rectangles for writing on surfaces due to the wasted space and instead elect to use circular or oval surfaces. For an example of this writing style in action: 

why don't modern militaries train troops on shield walls and melee, because modern technology has made melee largely irrelevant. Ground troops have to get to the ground, if you have a decent space defense force that will never happen. So most of your ground troops are only for dealing with local rebellions or as a last ditch defense force. You might have a few other elite specialists for stealth missions but that is going to add up to a very small proportion of your troops. It is much the same reason an island nation might put a lot more effort into naval/air defense than ground troops. Ground forces don't matter if you can keep them from ever reaching the ground, so defenders will put as much as they can into space defense and the attackers will do likewise. You also have the issue that you need a much larger force to cover space space since it is a 3 dimensional battlefield, there are no defensive lines, only defensive spheres that adds up to a lot more assets. 

If life exists there it will diversify. Evolution pushes life into exploiting every resource in its environment it can, resources in the environment includes other life, which is a very useful resource since it has everything you need in one package. This would be why it has evolved so many different times. What forms exactly will occur are impossible to predict. We don't know what other forms life can get away with. But simple things like trophic levels and and predator-prey relationships are inevitable. So yes IF life is present, and not brand new, you will get predators and prey, producers and consumers, ect. $URL$ $URL$ 

Consider something like the leaf cutter ant, which eat nothing but fungus, they evolved agriculture long before humans existed. They harvest plant material to farm the fungus and have been doing it for so long they can barely digest anything else. They even produce a biological antibiotic to kill off anything that might compete with the fungus. It would be easy to see a strong evolved disgust response against even trying to eat other food in such a species. They farm something to feed the fungus which can be fed a variety of things, then only eat the fungus, that would allow them to evolve behavioral plasticity since they have to find things in new environments to feed the fungus. Plus fungus agriculture has evolved at least three separate times in insects so you completely justify it on an alien species. Any advanced civilization could develop the technology to synthesize their food, but there are many reasons they would not bother, especially on a large scale. 

You have portrayed your Lodge not only as the prevailing order, but as a house of peacekeepers whose purpose is in "helping the world and all its peoples". They also have free reign and hold no one sovereign to themselves. As to whether they are involved or passive with regards to external events you haven't made their nature apparent. To truly "control" (bad word) everyone and keep the peace everywhere they would also have to be everywhere. They do not bow to the rules of these places and seem to have the power to enforce their will even with resistance, which could of course be avoided with diplomatic lubrication. This can be resolved by having the equivalent of embassies in major locations for fast response time, a larger coverage and easier access to the state of affairs in many places. With this they should receive ample warning of impeding threat and could from these forward bases of operation dissuade or prevent altercations well in advance. By having an embassy everywhere they ensure a face of neutrality and can under this mask of neutrality target and deal with any single party which is a legitimate offender to "rules" without siding with that party's enemies. Their paring with otherworldly beings also differentiates them from their charges and passively separates them in a way that gives them further "superiority" and claim to declare oneself such a powerful peacekeeping entity. Should all these precautions fail and the hand is forced. The lodge would most likely seek a path that keeps closest to its ideals while still ensuring its survival. They have shown to be willing to take precarious, possibly risky decisions to achieve their ends. One would assume they could resort to drastic means. As to which "side" in an option of two. Most likely the one where they survive, if survival is more important than risking becoming something one doesn't wish to be. 

I doubt that there is much which could top TechZen's answer, but a relevant theory which hasn't been touched on is Panspermia. EDIT: Missed post by DonyorM Panspermia: the theory that life on the earth originated from microorganisms or chemical precursors of life present in outer space and able to initiate life on reaching a suitable environment. Microscopic fungus has been shown to be able to survive and hibernate in the harsh conditions of space. Over a viable (extremely large) period of time, these fungal spores could traverse the enormous distance separating habitable/soon to be habitable worlds and enter before/after atmosphere formation to enter the primordial gene-pool of the planet. All life on earth has a large similar genetic base which could be transported with these spores and be implanted in the evolution of life on the other planet. This life would inherently be similar to life existing on earth.
