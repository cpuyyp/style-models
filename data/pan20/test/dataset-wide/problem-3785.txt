One idea is to approach the problem through stochastic differential equations with reflections off the boundary of domains. For example, this paper by Tanaka (1979) considers a stochastic differential equation with reflections off the boundary of a convex set. They prove existence and uniqueness for coefficients defined on the domain only, and as far as I can see, in the proof they don't extend the coefficients to all of $\mathbb{R}^d$. If unique solutions exist with reflecting boundary conditions for all time, then presumably the original equation has a solution up to hitting the boundary. A more recent reference is Lions and Sznitman (1984). This is a bit inelegant in that an SDE stopped at the boundary should be simpler than an SDE reflected off a boundary. But a least you don't need to extend the domain of the coefficients. 

Suppose I have three identically-distributed homogeneous continuous-time discrete state space Markov chains $X_1(t), X_2(t), X_3(t)$, $t\geq 0$. They evolve independently but share a common random variable $X_0$ as an initial condition. I let $$X_1=X_1(t_1), \ \ \ X_2=X_2(t_2), \ \ \ X_3=X_3(t_3)$$ for some times $t_1, t_2, t_3\geq 0$. I want to show that $$ I(X_1; X_2; X_3) \geq 0 $$ where $I$ is the multivariate mutual information (or information interaction) $$ I(A,B,C)= H(A,B,C) -H(A,B) - H(B,C) - H(A,C) + H(A) + H(B) + H(C) $$ where $H$ is the usual Shannon entropy. Background/Motivation There are well-known situations where $I(A;B;C)<0$, a famous one being if $A$ and $B$ are independent random variables, each $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$, and $C=AB$. But I conjecture that in the case I have described above $I(X_1;X_2;X_3)\geq 0$. I believe that the Markov chains being continuous-time and homogeneous is essential. The more general motivation is that I want to find very general situations where multivariate mutual information is non-negative. (One well-known example is if $A,B,C$ form a Markov chain.) 

I am interested in different contexts in which Gödel's incompleteness theorems arise. Besides traditional Gödelian proof via arithmetization and formalization of liar paradox it may also be obtained from undecidability results of Turing and Church. In the context of complexity theory, it is not hard to see that Gödel's theorem (as well as Turing's result) follows from the following Chaitin's result: there exists some natural number N such that for any program P of size more than N it is impossible to prove (say, in ZFC) that it is the smallest (in the sense of size, i. e. number of bits) of those programs which have the same inputs-outputs as P has. The number N depends on particular axiomatic system (say, ZFC) and is not very large so that it actually can be calculated. If You know other ways towards Gödel's incompleteness theorems, please, present them. Particularly, can Goedel's theorem be obtained without use of self-referential ideas? 

See David Marker's "Model theory. An introduction." Although argument is model theoretic, you can easily transform it into syntactic one. 

What you are doing above looks like forward Euler to me, which is very bad for Hamiltonian systems since it tends to continually add energy. (Backward Euler tends to continually remove energy.) The simplest sound method is the Verlet integrator, which is 2nd order and symplectic. You can read about it in $URL$ or $URL$ among other methods. 

My conjecture in the original question is false. Let $X_i(t)$ be continuous time Markov chains with two states 0 and 1, such that the rate of transition from 0 to 1 and from 1 to 0 is $1$. Let $X_0$ be 0 with probability $0.9$ and 1 with probability $0.1$. Choose $t_1=t_2=t_3$ such that the probability that $X_i=X_0$ is $3/4$ for all $i$. Then for all $i$, $$ H(X_i)=0.88129 \ldots, $$ and for all $i\neq j$, $$ H(X_i,X_j)= 1.75448 \ldots, $$ and $$ H(X_1,X_2,X_3)=2.61812 \ldots $$ This gives $$ I(X_1;X_2;X_3) = -0.00144 \ldots < 0. $$ I don't yet have any insight into why the triple mutual information is negative. This is about as negative as I could make it with the two state symmetric Markov chain. 

[Edition. In this answer I wrote about "philosophical logic" and "mathematical logic" in usual sense of these terms. But I also think that the difference between them is very conventional. For example, people studying knowledge formally by means of modal epistemic logics (as formal models) and those who studying provability logics to a large extent (if one forgets about actual motivations) are doing the same things -- they are investigating various modal logics.] "My question is about relations between logic as part of philosophy and mathematical logic from the second half of the 20th century when its seems that connections between these two areas have weakened." "I am quite curious also about the reasons for the much weaker connections between mathematical logic and formal models developed by philosophers at the later part of the 20th century." The main reason is that mathematical logic concerns with models of mathematical thought, but philosophical logic builds models for various parts of philosophy which are very different from mathematics (i. e. they may use modalities, analogy, induction and so on). To give one example of "formal models developed in philosophy that had become important in mathematical logic", Provability logic is such an example. To quote from Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy: "Provability logic is a modal logic that is used to investigate what arithmetical theories can express in a restricted language about their provability predicates." So, provability logics are modal logics which capture provability in formal systems of mathematical logic. Provability logic is regarded as an area of mathematical logic (which represented by Robert M. Solovay, George Boolos, Sergei Artemov, Lev Beklemishev, Giorgi Japaridze, Dick de Jongh and so on) and it uses models, ideas and techniques from modal logic which is (in any case, was) part of philosophical logic. "Another thing I am curious about is to what extent for the applications to computer science formal models described by philosophers turned out to be useful." Again, the original papers by Kripke was by no means concerned with computer science. Kripke discovered another way of interpreting the modalities and the context was philosophical one. But today the whole field of program verification in CS is based on modal logic. A lot of specific modal logics are developed in CS which model specific aspects (temporal logics, dynamic logics and so on). Crucial results about them such as expresiveness, decidability and completeness are proved using essentialy the same ideas as those from original papers in philosophical context. Finally, to speak "about works in philosophical logic that were motivated or influenced by developments in mathematical logic", I quote from what I said in the meta thread: "A new interesting field in philosophy is growing in this century often called Formal Philosophy (this term I believe has its origin from the title of Richard Montague's collected papers book). People of this field (among them R. Montague, H. Putnam, E. Zalta, D. Bonnay...) are trying to solve philosophical problems using formal logic. Particularly, and this is important, many of them try to formalize such kinds of reasoning as modality, induction, analogy, simplicity, naturality, generalization and so on as well as concrete philosophical theories (which are of course in the domain of philosophical logic) using formalisms and methods of mathematical logic. 

Please consider the Stratonovich stochastic differential equation (SDE) $$ dX = b(X)\circ dB $$ where $B$ is standard Brownian motion and $X(0)=X_0$. This corresponds to the Ito (SDE) $$ dX = \frac{1}{2} b(X) b'(X) dt + b(X) dB. $$ I would like a reference showing (or even just stating) that trajectories of this equation are time-reversible in the following sense: that for all $m\geq 1$ and $t_m > t_{m-1} > \ldots > t_1 >0$, the joint distribution of $$ (X(t_1), \ldots, X(t_m) ) $$ is identical to the joint distribution of $$ (X(-t_1), \ldots, X(-t_m) ). $$ Also, is there a particular term for this kind of time-reversibility? People also use time-reversibility to mean detailed balance for systems in equilibrium, which is different from this. Motivation In a paper I am listing advantages of expressing diffusions in terms of the Stratonovich convention. I want to be able to briefly state that if the drift coefficient in a Stratonovich SDE is 0, then the equation is time-reversible in the sense I state above. Edit: Further Explanation Here is a clarification of what I mean above, as well as a justification of my claim. Let $B(t)$ for $t \in \mathbb{R}$ be two-sided Brownian motion with $B(0)=0$. Let $X(t)$ solve the above Stratonovich SDE. Let $Y(t)=X(-t)$. Then $$ dY(t) = dX(-t) = -b(X(-t)) \circ dB(-t) = b(Y(t)) \circ d\tilde{B}(t) $$ where $\tilde{B}(t) = -B(-t)$ is also a Brownian motion. So $Y$ solves the same equation as $X$ with a different Brownian motion. These formal manipulations can be justified by letting $B$ be approximated by smooth stochastic processes and then taking the limit using the Wong-Zakai result. Thanks for any help! 

Works by Montague show that natural language is not SO MUCH different from formal languages, its syntax and semantics has strong structure. You may say that they are semiformal. That is why we may apply all the techniques and results from mathematical logic, in which specificaly mathematical languages are formalized and deeply studied. As a result we have a field of formal theory of natural language and its aspects (grammar, semantics, development and so on). You may see the broad range of topics presented on this conference: $URL$ This opens the way for doing philosophy of language by formalizing the problems and answer them by mathematical proof. The work of Hilary Putnam presents attempts to tackle the problems of philosophy of mind and philosophy of language by comparing with formal models. To quote from his "Models and reality" paper: "In this paper I want to take up Skolem's arguments, not with the aim of refuting them, but with the aim of extending them in somewhat the direction he seemed to be indicating. It is not my claim that the "Lowenheim-Skolem paradox" is an antinomy in formal logic; but I shall argue that it is an antinomy, or something close to it, in philosophy of language. Moreover, I shall argue that the resolution of the antinomy - the only resolution that I myself can see as making sense - has profound implications for the greate metaphysical dispute about realism which has always been the central dispute in the philosophy of language." See his collected papers. Edward Zalta in his Principia Metaphysica has formalization of general notions of abstract and concrete objects. In mathematics (today) the most basic objects are sets. In Leibniz' Monadology (which is pure philosophical theory) they are monads. Zalta formalizes the monads and does Monadology formally. As well as Plato's theory of forms, theory of meinongian objects, theory of situations, the theory of worlds, theory of times. Moreover, Zalta claims that his formalization enables to obtain new useful abstract notions (objects) automaticaly by mechanized theorem proving. See his home page." 

It seems unlikely that your problem is going to have a solution in the generality you've described but here goes. There are two approaches you could try. (1) Discretize the partial derivatives using finite differences on the grid. At every point on the grid your PDE will give you a nonlinear equation. You will have a total of $n^2$ equations in $n^2$ unknowns. But each equation will only contain a small number of unknowns. You can use a variant Newton's method to solve these equations. But you have to work with the restrictions that you probably don't want to code up the Jacobian for the system, and you could not use a direct method to calculate the solution even if you did. I would recommend looking at a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method. (2) Exploit the method of characteristics. Rewrite your equation as $$ (cz+d) z_x - (az+b) z_y = 0. $$ This gives characteristic equations $$ \frac{dx}{dt}=cz+d, \ \ \ \frac{dy}{dt}=a z+b, \ \ \ \frac{dz}{dt}= 0. $$ There are numerical methods for solving nonlinear hyperbolic equations exploiting characteristics. Sethian and Vladimirsky have a nice one. Your problem does not quite fit into their scheme but their paper might help give you ideas. So, if you problem does have a solution, one of these might work. I would expect (1) to be more robust than (2), but also more expensive. 

Lindstrom's theorem states that any extension of FOL more expressible than FOL fails to have either compactness or Lowenheim-Skolem. When I first read Lindstrom's theorem my first reaction was: "Does it mean incompleteness of any more expressible extension of FOL? And why this obviously important question isn't discussed in standard logic texts?" Standard extensions (such as second order logic) in fact are incomplete. After some attempts of proving incompleteness I found reference to Vaught's paper in which he proves completeness of extension of FOL by adding quantifier Qx = "there are uncountably many x such that..." It would be very interesting (at least for me) to understand complete extensions in general. Such an extensions may be of great importance, for instance, for computer science, because FOL isn't enough expressive for its purposes. So, my questions are: 1) Do you know some other examples of complete FOL extensions? 2) Are there some results concerning characterization of complete FOL extensions? 2) Do you know any peoples, papers, books... studying general properties of FOL extensions? Thanks in advance. 

What you call the Euler discretization is sometimes called the Euler-Maruyama discretization. There is a lot of literature about its convergence properties. One place to look is the classic book by Kloeden and Platen (Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations). Another is Milstein and Tretyakov (Stochastic Numerics for Mathematical Physics). A very convenient and readable introduction is the paper by Des Higham $URL$ 

There are quite a few people who have tried to generalize metrics to more than two variables. I once tried to track down all the references on this subject for a paper. Here are some: There is an extensive literature on 2-metrics, in which $d$ takes 3 arguments. This appears to have been introduced by Gahler. Here is a recent example with some references. What James Cranch mentions in his answer is (I think) originally due to Menger (K. Menger, Untersuchungen uber allgemeine Metrik, Math. Ann. 100.). Menger takes $d$ to be the volume of an $n$-simplex in Euclidean space. Then he tries to abstract away from that. (I can't read German so take this summary with a grain of salt.) Three recent papers that seek such generalizations are by Deza and Rosenberg (Small cones of $m$-hemimetrics), by Chepoi and Fichet (A note on three-way dissimilarities and their relationship with two-way dissimilarities), and by Warren ($n$-way metrics). My impression from all of these is that there is no one natural way to extend metrics to take more than 2 arguments. 

For the Kronecker's views, Brouwer's intuitionism and much more real motivations for Hilbert's program than the usual tales about paradoxes as main reasons of crisis (they are only a pretext and the reasons go back to 19th century reincarnation of mathematics) see for example Jeremy Avigad and Erich Reck "Clarifying the nature of the infinite: the development of metamathematics and proof theory". You may also look at many other important historical works referenced there. 

The classical proof You have mentioned shows how powerful logic may be. The crucial point of the proof is the use of the law of excluded middle (A or not(A)). In that case we are lucky to have knowledge of which of the two possibilities: i) $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational or ii) $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is not rational takes place to be. But You can imagine a statement A about natural numbers such that neither A nor not(A) is provable (in, say, ZFC). Now we may use analogously the particular statement of the law of excluded middle "A or not(A)" in some proof of some statement B. In that case the statement B is proved both by supposing A and by supposing not(A) and at the same time we know in advance that we shall not resolve which of the cases has the place to be. In such a proof the purely logical priciple of excluded middle becomes even more important (or at least as important) than the axioms of actual mathematical structure (in this case that of natural numbers). It is this power that made some mathematicians (e. g. intuitionists under the head of Brouwer) to think that logical principles such as that of exluded middle have caused the paradoxes discovered in the beginning of the XX century. For a classical mathematician the proof of B would be a legitimate proof since he/she believes that either A or not(A) is valid for natural numbers even if we shall never prove neither of them. (This position is often called platonism because it presupposes the "independent existence" of natural numbers.) Intuitionist, however, says that it is a hypothesis and to turn this reasoning into a valid proof one should prove that indeed one of those possiblities has the place to be.
