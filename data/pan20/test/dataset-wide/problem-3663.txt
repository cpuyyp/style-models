You may want to do back extensions instead. They're at least a more well known exercise that work the same muscles and are the lower back analogue of knee raises in a lot of ways. 

It's impossible to say nothing's wrong with you. I'm not a doctor. If you have medical concerns, see a doctor. But that aside, I would say it is normal to be out of breath after a hard set of any compound lift. Heavy squats (for 5 reps) almost always leave me feeling somewhere between out of breath and about to pass out. There are things that can make post-set exhaustion worse, like low blood glucose, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalance. So make sure you're eating enough carbs, staying hydrated, and getting enough sodium/potassium/calcium. And like Dave Liepmann said, make sure you're breathing. That sounds obvious, but it's instinctive to hold your breath when you're straining and it's easy not to notice. 

I have seen on internet a site that claims you can become tall even after 25. You can take many inches. There are many fotos before and after from many humans. I search it and I find different aspects , some of them conflict but I didn't get from them a result if this is true or not. I am 22 I don't think I can increase my high but this gave me hope. Many in YouTube telling its a scam,is it? Can be a good scientific answer why it can't be this in age 25.I don't write the site but I think everyone can google it and find it. Additional to,genetics can be changing as i heard from a doctor in case you doing more than four hours a day hung up and give you few inches 2-3 ,is this true too? Workout could be used to be taller or this is a fake advertisement with only target the money. 

I am having trouble "reconciling" having a proper posture while doing abdominal breathing. If I understand correctly, proper posture should involve pulling the abdomen in, among other things, while diaphragmatic (belly) breathing involves exactly the opposite. Is it possible to keep the abdomen tucked in, and breathe abdominally at the same time? 

Most articles nowadays seem to favor High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) compared to Steady State Cardio (SS), for various reasons like faster fat loss and getting higher levels of cardio fitness in the same time period. Not only that, but exercise retention among individuals has been much better due to shorter durations of HIIT workouts, which is a good thing. There are even articles which claim that HIIT might improve aerobic capacity and quality of life in people with heart diseases (compared to steady aerobic cardio). Articles which warn against excessive endurance excercise (Potential Adverse Cardiovascular Effects From Excessive Endurance Exercise, Exercise training reduces resting heart rate via downregulation of HCN4) mostly deal with marathon runners and cyclists - although it's not clear whether it's the endurance part that should be emphasized. On the other hand, some articles note that there is a difference in heart adaptation between HIIT and SS cardio: on one hand there is a Concentric Hypertrophy of the Heart in HIIT (due to anaerobic stresses), vs the Eccentric Hypertrophy of the Heart for SS, which increases the stretch reflex (less energy used per beat). According to Wikipedia, concentric hypertrophy is the less appealing type of hypertrophy, because it increases wall thickness without increasing the chamber radius, which can "impair filling and lead to diastolic dysfunction". (Update) Again, regarding endurance, there is an article which describes an "U-shape" distribution of mortality as a function of exercise pace, quantity, and frequency, i.e. a potentially reduced benefits of endurance cardio if taken too far: 

recently my family bought this.I workout my full body to gain muscle.First can someone like this machine obtain muscles on legs?Second,how much time and how many days should a thin guy do it.Third question should it be "normal mode" ,"soft" ,"hard"(I mean the difficult of doing it .What is more helpful of those to obtain muscles on legs.I avoid to refer the mark for no advertisements reasons. 

I want to have a good posture. I think that if someone hasn't good he/she cans obtain it with workout. We can't have all the time or money to go to a gym or somewhere else to do our posture good. I do push up I don't know if that helps my posture I thought that helps me. What workouts could do at home to obtain good posture? push up?what?thanks a lot :) 

I've experienced this twice now. A few hours after my workout, I'll be lounging around (with my leg bent) and suddenly get a slight burn in my VM ("the teardrop"). If I straighten my leg, the burn intensifies. Is this a sign I really do need to start stretching post-workout or do I just need more potassium? I'm doing Strong Lifts, so my legs are getting worked pretty hard. 

At the gym today, someone advised me to vary my foot position to better target the different muscles in the calf. Specifically, they advised that I laterally and medially rotate my foot. Intuitively, this seems like a bad idea, since the ankle is most stable when straight. Thus, it would seem, rotating it would put it in a compromised position, conceptually similar to squatting with bowed knees. If it matters, the specific machine I was using was the inclined leg press machine. Is there actually anything to what they said or is my intuitive reprehension correct? 

How can be produced a powerful punch.What muscles needs? I workout biceps and triceps,does this play a role or is clearly about technique.What should I improve? 

I have heard as an example that if you eat at night Pan Potatoes increase the body fat. Can this help me add some kg if I eat every night?( its unhealthy way?) What about eggs and bread on Pans?I like workout the morning I don't eat everyday eggs(I think I will have issues even I am 24) so if I eat eggs with bread that have been mixed on Pan could I destroy Protein and cardio?With other word this meal isn't helping me to increase the muscle size? Generally Pans foods aren't good for muscle growth,doesn't affect our body to get big or those foods are unhealthy but help grow our muscle ?Should be avoiding or should it be in our food source? 

I have my own method for this and I'd like either confirmation that it's an acceptable solution or a reason why it's not and better alternatives. The reason I'm framing the question like this is because I like my method. It's convenient and it allows a practically unlimited amount of force to be used. (A lot of the articles I've read say that lifters sometimes need to add more force to get their mobility to change, due to having stronger/harder tissues.) My method is to lean forward against a wall with my feet some distance behind me and flat on the ground. The greater the distance from the wall, the more the ankle has to bend to accommodate the movement. If necessary, I move my feet further back and/or push against the wall hard enough to feel the stretch in the back part of my lower leg. I definitely feel it stretching my Achilles and calf, but my concern (leading me to ask about it) is that it may be leaving out other tissues that limit ankle dorsiflexion. As far as goals go, I want to be able to squat to depth without having to be forced down by weight. I can squat with reasonably good form with weight, but I can't get close to parallel (without my heels rising) with just bodyweight. 

Which suggests that achieving higher levels of fitness might increase the heart rate recovery value and help reduce the health risks, as most studies suggest anyway. Athletes and fitter persons might have heart recovery rates larger than 30 bpm. 

However, the article which describes the experiment notes that patients with abnormal heart-rate recovery also had other indicators of poor cardiovascular health, meaning the cause-effect relationship might not be so clear: 

The jogging pace in the image above might be related to HIIT, for example. So, while everyone agrees that regular exercise improves cardiovascular fitness, lowers resting heart rate and increases longevity on average, it still appears that hypertrophy effects of HIIT might be more problematic in the long term? 

For example, the chart shows that heart rate recovery of ~10 bpm suggests ~4 times larger risk than the baseline (2 to 7 times with 95% confidence). The article also defined "peak exercise" as being as strenuous as possible, possibly even larger than the theoretical heart rate reserve: 

You're describing two different types if stretching: ballistic, when you push with momentum, and static, when you push slower and hold the stretch steady for 30 seconds or more. Static is safer because you are much less likely to push too far when you know you're going to have to deal with the pain for the next 30 seconds or more. With ballistic, there is more of a chance that you will bounce too far/hard and pull/strain/tear something by going past the point your body would stop you at if you were moving slower. With static stretching, you generally stretch kinda slowly, so there's no momentum that would push you past where your body would tell you to stop. I've always been told in my health classes that ballistic stretching should be avoided unless you know what you're doing. In general, taking what is normally a static stretch and making it dynamic by bouncing, is usually not a good idea.
