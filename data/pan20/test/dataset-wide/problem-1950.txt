He's mentioned to you what your level's minimum is. You can do your own research to try to understand what the average market rate is for someone with your profile. If there is a big gap, you could use this, combined with any motivating highlights from your time at the company, to suggest closing more of the gap. 

I think there is a case to be made to transition without taking a pay cut. One of the biggest challenges in creating good software is to find someone who deeply understands what users of the software will want it of it. Someone with domain experience (i.e. understands what users want) and actual development experience is very valuable. You may be better suited initially to work together with a more experienced developer, but in the long term there are lots of possibilities for someone with "hybrid" experience. 

It will likely depend on the agreement the company has with the recruiter. For example, we usually have agreements that say if the recruiter is the first to send a candidate to us, we are obliged to pay them a finder's fee if we hire the person within a calendar year. 

First, you don't need to wait for recruiters to contact you. There are plenty of websites that post software developer job openings that you could scan through and proactively apply to. Second, I would nuance or clarify your technology list. It seems unlikely that you have actively used Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, And HTML all in equal measure. Make it clear which ones you have used most. Third, remove the part about looking outside the game industry. People are more interested in what interests you than what doesn't interest you. Give some thought to some general or specific types of development that might interest you and mention those instead. For example, scientific software, database software, backend, front end, or even just working in an agile shop. Last, don't despair. At 3 years, you're no longer junior, but you're far from having typecast yourself as a game developer. In your position, you don't have 10 years of experience in a prospective employer's domain and/or technology so and they will not be looking for that in you. Instead, it's more important to demonstrate you can learn and adapt quickly. If anything, being a game developer should be a positive here as the game developers have a reputation for being clever. EDIT: To touch on the discussion in the comments: Regardless of the industry you apply to, you need to make a compelling case to potential employers that you are a good fit for their company. You can best do this before an interview by writing a targeted cover letter. You can also have a bit of a pitch prepared for interviews. As a developer with 3 years of experience, you should focus your ability to adapt, ability to write good, clean, well tested code, solid understanding of computer science fundamentals, and real-world software engineering experience. You should try where possible to give examples of these. Additionally, you should spend some time understanding the companies you apply to. What industry are they in? What types of software do they need or develop? In your cover letter and in any interview, you should include some details about why that interests you and how you might make a contribution in those areas. 

Based on your response, you are still being indirect. If you really like the first place, you should put your cards clearly on the table: 

Running a meeting is a skill much like any other. You can improve in it through practice, training or coaching. Different types of meetings require different types of skills. For example, a performance review meeting is quite different than an interview or a status meeting. Being prepared for unexpected question is usually a question of experience, knowledge of the meeting topic and familiarity with where to get additional information. For example, for running a performance review you should be aware of the standard format used in your company, any specific details that should be covered, who the key technical or HR contacts are for additional clarification, highlights of the employee's performance, and some common areas of concern that might come up. In general, your company should not ask you to run meetings independently that you are not yet prepared to run. They should ensure you have the appropriate knowledge or skillset for running the meeting before asking you to do so. For example, they should not ask a junior staff member to give a key status update to an important customer. Instead, they should ask the project lead or similar person. Additionally, the company could prepare for running specific meetings by providing you with training or coaching, having you be an observer in meetings first, and/or having you prepare some of the material to be presented in a meeting. For example, it is common in my company to get communication training and reviewing the details of the performance management process before giving performance reviews. To more directly answer your question, you handle unexpected questions using the following techniques: 

In my experience, what you put in writing and what you say verbally to people in confidence are different things. In your resume, you should just mention that you have significant experience building a variety of application pages in the industry for a very large company. You do not not need to name the company, but you can say things like "large, multinational" company. You can also mention the subject area that your applications relate to. For example, you might say you built pages in support of "Aerial Reconnaissance Applications". The point being that you can still disclose the subject area you worked in without disclosing specific project names, company names or any proprietary information. In terms of an interview, it should be OK to verbally disclose to employees of the very large company that you have indirectly worked with their company and you might mention the internal (i.e. internal to very large company) names of some of the projects you worked on. If you are very concerned about sensitivity, then only disclose this verbally and only to actual employees of the company. That is, do not disclose it to your recruiter and do not disclose it to contractors of the very large company. 

Remember that not knowing all answers is normal. It's only a cause for concern if you find yourself unable to answer critical questions (e.g. why the project late when you are the project manager) or a majority of questions. You will get more respect by helping people get answers to their questions than giving them the wrong answer. 

If your goal in attending the conference is for your own gain, then I suggest asking if X is OK if you attend at your own cost. It would also be good to confirm separately that X does not have rights to whatever you publish, which may prevent you from presenting "their" material after leaving the company. If your goal is to support X and show the good things they are doing, then you might discuss collaborating with a colleague on the paper before leaving and having the colleague present it. 

The professional approach to this is to work it out as best you can with your direct manager. If you are unable to reach an agreement, consult your employee handbook on what options you have. If you must speak with your manager's boss, you should inform her up front that you are planning to do so. Ideally, you should do it in a positive light and include her in the conversation. You could suggest that you would like a third party to moderate the discussion and use the opportunity to think together about better ways you could work together. Specifically, in any conversation about this you should try to offer solutions or work towards solutions rather than simply pointing out problems. For example, saying "You are making unreasonable demands" is not very helpful. You might try to educate her about why the demands are unreasonable. You could then focus on how you can more clearly communicate your progress and any impediments and help her understand how you will be more effective if she plays defense for you and creates space for you to do your work. 

If you had had a direct and reasonably close relationship with the hiring manager and you had done the internship with that hiring manager, I would say that giving some a status update / thank you note about how you are building on what you learned from the previous internship would be appropriate. However, this is not the case. Given that you only have contact with the HR manager, I would recommend waiting until you have more certainty about your graduation date to reach out to them again. At that time, I would suggest something like: 

You mention in your contents that one location is in the US and the other is in Europe. Salaries are quite different between the US and Europe. Assuming you are from the US, then paying you a US salary in Europe would be an expat arrangement. This is typically a highly prized prized arrangement. It is unlikely something they would do for an intern, especially if the European lovation is used as a way to reduce overall costs in the company. Note that cost of living in central and eaten Europe is lower than the US and good companies will offer their employees there a locally competitive salary. In western Europe, you will generally get a much better benefits package with the lower salary than you would in the US. You are probably seeing an offer for a locally competitive salary. 

I'm assuming you are approaching this problem as an independent contractor trying to sell your services directly to potential customers. You are not selling your credentials. You are selling services or solutions. If your competition with fewer credentials is offering better and cheaper solutions to your potential customers, you have a problem that your credentials alone will not solve. Your crendentials may make you a more trustworthy supplier to new customers, but after the first job, trustworthiness will be defined purely on how well you have already delivered. If you get word-of-mouth recommendations from customers, you can be assured it is not because you have 4 acronyms after your name but rather because you provided a great solution or service. If you approach it from this angle, you will see that emphasizing your credentials is important, but it should not be the central focus of your message. You should mention your credentials clearly on your website in a section about your background. You should also place enough emphasis on your background and experience to be taken seriously in initial conversations. Your credentials are a small part of this. The main focus of your website and initial conversations, though, should be about how you will meet the potential customer's needs. You should focus on how great your solutions are, how you have provided similar solutions to other customers before, etc. Once you have a great initial conversation and a great website to entice potential customers, then you should find that your e-mail signature and your business cards become more of a reminder to people of who you are and how to contact you rather than a sales vehicle in their own right. In this context, it should not be necessary to include your credentials everywhere. If you simply can't resist putting credentials in your signature and on your business cards, try to limit yourself to one that best conveys how having that credential will ensure your solutions are top notch. 

If you put enough releases out that are not immediately welcomed with open arms by the customers, they will start to dread updates and have a low opinion of the team's ability to deliver. This will also start to impact team morale. It's good that you recognize that the team is doing their best and external circumstances (e.g. unreaslistic deadlines) are the root cause of poor initial feedback. It's important to recognize that you have a strategic problem (how to deliver a truly successful release on time) and a tactical problem (how to keep the hard working team motivated in the face of external pressures). Some short term rewards that might help are having a team dinner, giving public thanks for their efforts, getting the customers to recognize how quickly improvements are made based on their feedback, etc. The strategic problem is where you should focus your efforts though. You want to get to a place where you do not need to be celebrating partially achieved goals. Two possible ways you might approach this are getting more realistic timelines for the required scope or reducing scope for given timelines so it can be delivered successfully. 

If you are applying for something that requires a work permit, then you are probably looking to emigrate. Emigrating is expensive and difficult with no long term guarantees of success in the country you emigrate to. You also need to familiarize yourself with the immigration process for that country to understand if a work permit can even be secured for someone with a 3 month delay before they start. There is absolutely no guarantee that an immigration process will be smooth or rational. If you are serious about achieving this goal and your current place of employment has restrictions (e.g. 3 month notice period) that will complicate your chances of success, you may have better long term success finding a new local position with conditions more favorable towards your emigration goal. In short, you should not put yourself in a position where you may be unemployed. For the current opportunity, you should have an honest discussion with the prospective employer about the notice period and the work permit situation. If you can't reach an agreement on how to proceed, I would encourage you to see if your best bet is to try again with another foreign company or to take steps locally to better your prospects of emigrating before trying again. 

You should be honest with them. If you are an interesting enough candidate for them, they will possibly make an exception in reimbursing you for travel. If not, then you can amicably part ways. 

If the role she is applying for does not deal with much phone communication, she could just explain that she is not comfortable speaking on the phone and ask if she could do the initial screen in person. 

To follow up on my comment elsewhere, one good option would be to offer unsolicited positive feedback up the chain on your new manager. This avoids addressing your concerns directly (project failure, her being fired) while still giving her some points for doing good work. You can do this by e-mailing her directly and CC'ing her boss or e-mailing her boss and optionally CC'ing her. Your e-mail could be something like this:
