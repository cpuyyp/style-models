The reason you are having trouble is how basic needs are fulfilled vary wildly not just by time period but also by culture and landscape. the simpliest human settlement is a a few huts to sleep in, a communal fire pit, and a garbage pile, and that's it. even simple things like how food is obtained or what resources are abundant changes community structure dramatically. Hunter/gather, fishing, herding, or plant crops all have different living conditions. Your best bet is to use realworld examples. Pick your time period, climate, and culture then search from there. But you will still have to consider things like whether it is a market town or farming village, are the people nomadic pastoralists or or a fishing village. 

something like a suitcase gun handle might work, or like the guitar gun from desperado. Both are terrible for aiming though, but on the other hand bulk would be less of an issue. With this recoil would also be more of a problem on large guns, something more like a normal rifle would be good for larger guns. Shoulder bracing will make even human long guns work fine. the real issue is how do they build them without the ability to do precision grips. 

Now if you want upright bipedalism it's a bit tougher just becasue that has not evolved very often, and there would not be much benefit. But you could swing the body upright as seen in Therizinosaurs. What might you see in the finished intelligent descendant: *They will only have three fingers (two and thumb) dinosaurs lost them pretty early. Their wrists fold sideways, how noticeable this is would be up to you. Ornithopods have 4-5 fingers and the wrist works more like ours. Their hips will be wider than a human of the same size, and the legs should point a little forward. The dinosaur pelvis is very different than a mammalian one. The more upright their posture the more it will look like a therizinosaurus pelvis, although narrower. They will be digitigrade, with either three or four toes, basically pick the bird foot you want and use that. You could even have the same foot pattern as velociraptors just as troodons have. How much of a snout they have is up to you, you could even include a beak if you want it certainly evolved often enough. The head should be bigger than a human the shape of the skull puts more bony support around the jaw muscles, although if birds are any indication they may get more intelligence out of a smaller brain. the neck should be longer than a human and that means I expect the skull should be attached to the neck at the back of the skull not right underneath it at 90 degrees as in humans. Dinosaurs and birds have very rigid torsos no flexing at the stomach for them. That's why the have more flexible necks. Dinosaurs have worse hearing than humans but better vision, especially color vision, how that affects them I leave up to you. Just don't look at the attempts at a "humanized troodon" it's awful and wasn't made with evolution or anatomy in mind. you'll get something more like D&D lizardfolk in rough body shape than an argonian. But you can decide how upright you want them to be, just keep in mind only mammals have buttocks. *Oh one more thing, your animals will not chew, not really, they would have a crop and they would swallow stones (gastroliths) which will do the chewing for them. I could even see a market for hand cut angular stones for this purpose, you might even see wealthy individuals buying hard semi-precious gems like jade or corundum for this. I imagine regurgitating worn out (round and smooth) stones would like seen like any bodily function. Ornithopods on the other hand do chew and even have cheeks to facilitate it and they would not have the stones. As AlexP pointed out any basal theropod or coelurosaur will work, if you go early enough you can get more than three fingers as well, any you won't have to worry about proto-feathers. 

Almost all of that already occurs in nature with one exception, the only 2 offspring is impossible as the wild condition, any disease, predators, or natural disaster would drive the species extinct in short order. Your species could never evolve in the first place IF this cannot change. They could be like humans and experience a drop in number of offspring under very high standard of living (extremely low infant/child mortality) but have much higher birth rates under lower survival conditions. humans only have around 1.9 offspring in very high standard of living countries, since the offspring are all but guaranteed to survive they instead they instinctively invest much more energy and resources in each individual child. in worse condition humans have around 5-6 offspring, but only 2 on average survive to reproduce. when regions experience a rise in standard of living the population often spikes as it takes a little time for the number of offspring to change. 1000 individuals and advanced medicine are mutually exclusive. It is hard to see how they could have any form of technology or even much of a civilization with only a 1000 individuals. 1000 individuals is barely enough to support a single general practitioner much less a medical specialist. Your species will have a hard time supporting bronze age technology much less anything modern. if they use DNA this number in of itself is a problem since they have little variability, 1000 individuals in not a healthy population of a sexual species. Otherwise this is just exclusive monogamy which already exists in animals, the only trick is, unless one dies after mating, we know of no species with 100% mate fidelity, some are remarkably high however. Notably some will cheat but still stay socially bonded until death, prairie voles are good example. So you could have your species form perminate monogamous relationships and still have infidelity. 

Force fields as weapons You know after the first prequel came out I came up with a working hypothesis about how lightsabers operated, it was completely different than the official method. They showed they had the capabilities to produce force field with variable passage (blaster bolts go out but not in). I had assumed lightsabers were just a super hot plasma contained in a elongate ellipsoid forcefield that let any matter in but only let a small amount back out. a light saber can stop a lightsaber becasue the two fields repel. Their power source last forever because so much of the heat is conserved because it cannot escape. That would explain how they don't burn the wielder and how it carves such neat holes instead of creating a fountainous spray of molten material like a plasma cutter does. Now you can use that as is or take the next step and use force field based weapons without bothering with plasma. Imagine if you could creating a cutting edge made of wedge shaped force field or even a planar one. The cutting edge is no longer restricted by atoms or bonding strength but on how precise your mathematics and emitters are. You can make a subatomic cutting edge, that would cut through normal matter like butter. And instead of a burnt hole you would just have perfect planar cut out fantasy anime, were the object is cut with no visible marks until it falls apart. for comparison the blades for preparing electron microscope slides are a few hundred atoms wide and will cut through your hand as easily as they cut air. At subatomic edges you could cut anything as easily as cutting air, except another force field. Forcefield could also be used to get other shapes so you are not limited to sword shapes, in fact a bet the cutting fields would have a huge number of industrial uses. bonus dialogue for the force swords: What's that weird fizzy glow along the sword edge when you swing? Oh, well most of the time it just cleaves atomic bonds but every so often it hits an atomic nucleus and fissions it. 

moving things to and from high places will open up many jobs, and result on far fewer humans dying from falling off of high ladders or poorly constructed scaffolding. note most of these jobs do not require moving heavy thing just getting to the locations. steeplejacks, church cleaners, thatchers, roofing work, eggers, and a hundred other jobs are more about working high not weight lifting. Fishing, medieval fishermen used to pay people to stand on the highest places the could find to spot fish schools for them, (water is to reflective at low angles to see through well) harpies could do this easier and without having to find something tall to climb on. I could easily see every fishing community having its own family of harpies fish spotting for them. Then you remember they might not be able to pull nets up but they could drop them, that would be useful in and of itself. As Mart mentions as scouts, shepards, mapmakers, game wardens are all great jobs, any job that requires covering long distances of wilderness terrain would be perfect jobs for them. there were a lot of jobs like this. guards, storm watchers. I imagine every town would have a few families of harpies with no other job but to glide high over the city and spot oncoming armies and/or storms. way cheaper than building and manning watch towers. Likewise every large ship would hire one or two for the same thing, not to mention flying messages from ship to ship or ship to shore. I can see dozens of jobs in the maritime industry. That brings up messengers, which others have mentioned, but people underestimate how useful they could be even inside a city as a messenger, they can fly over buildings and traffic and even find people who are out and about with ease. over long distance a horse might be better, but for simple messages within a town or province they would be vastly faster and more reliable, also far more secure since it is a lot harder to jump them in an alley. Archers, if harpies can draw and fire a bow with their feet they should be the most devastating archers in history, they would make horse archers look obsolete. If being the key term. Fruit pickers and nutters, working together with humans, harpies would make excellent fruit pickers, especially for getting the hardest to reach items on the high and outer branches. 

If we could engineer hexagonal or square bamboo, you could bring the price of lumber down by a lot. but really mud bricks have always been cheap, in dry climates you can build from almost nothing but clay and straw and end up with a decent home. I can't give hard numbers on the price though. But we have already figured a way to drastically reduce labor costs, prefabricated modular housing, built on a giant assembly line then transported to site in sections. maximum number of homes for lowest cost. Prices I have seen are around $65 a sqrft in the US. They work becasue the raw material is moved in bulk to a central location that can be built for that purpose reducing cost of material. Your workers are under ideal conditions all the time and you are only transporting the finished material instead of everything including the workers as in normal construction. If you want a futuristic feel automated airship delivery would be great again lower cost becasue it does not have to move the home in pieces, and are much more maneuverable than trucks. 

larry niven came up with a way, spin the planet faster so it flattens out just a bit, the higher altitude at the equator will make it cold enough to form glaciers. Works even better is the planet spins 90 degrees or so to the orbital plane. Note there may be a significant change in gravity depending on how flat you make it. 

In original voodoo a voodoo doll is just a ward against spirits you nailed to a structure or tree. The European tradition of poppets, which were the sympathetic magic links to a person, got associated with voodoo dolls by outsiders. So voodoo dolls as we commonly think of them were never actually part of voodoo. In fact voodoo is one of the few traditions they do not show up in. $URL$ A common concept in many fantasy stories is the idea that a voodoo doll needs some part of a person to make/maintain the connection, hair, blood, a photo, ect. If you remove this thing the connection is broken. But really it depends on how magic in your world works. Or course you could try the Granny Weatherwax solution and put your real arm in a fire and make the voodoo doll burst into flames instead. 

your big problem is that since it is not made of specialized cells, it is basically a giant moving wad of easy food for anything with teeth. 

you describe a mixed tundra and taiga environment. Without modern technology the cultures that survive in those places are the Inuit and Samis. Which you focus on will depend on your landscape. In either case they rely on meat heavy diets, a general lack of metal tools (outside trade and meteorites), and a nomadic lifestyle. The more forest there is the more it will favor the Sami lifestyle. The Sami do fishing whenever possible but are more heavily reliant on a herd animal, basically pastoralism. Such societies have to be nomadic to get enough forage or their animals. the sparser the forests, the more an Inuit type culture will dominate, with a heavy focus on fishing and hunting marine mammals, The lack of timber makes building more difficult and they are more reliant on marine mammals for fuel. Because of this population centers are more focused around the coast.
