The advantage of having these helmets is that the defensive coordinator can make changes to defensive calls, based on what the defensive staff sees from the offensive. This change provided defenses a counter to the quarterbacks' communications advantage. From the offense's perspective, knowing which player is making defensive audibles is probably of limited value, since the radio turns off with 15 seconds left on the play clock. The defensive player with the radio would be quite obvious - the two designated players are chosen before the game, and the active one would be wearing a helmet with the green dot and would be passing along updated defensive plays. However, there is another possibility, as Peter King notes in a recent Sports Illustrated column. He relates an Eli Manning anecdote describing the importance of knowing who is "the mike": 

Runner's World also had an article discussing the benefits of cross-training from a runner's perspective that may apply to other sports as well: 

In practice, if multiple quarterbacks go down, the teams will still need to field eleven players on offense. The replacement quarterbacks can be existing quarterbacks on the roster (either scholarship or walk-on players) or other position players. 

They do this to prevent their shoes from getting slippery. It is the same reason they mop the floors near the hoops. It is important that the players have a good grip on the floor, and if their shoes are damp they do not have enough traction. It reduces the risk of injury and helps them to play better. 

First off, the strike zone is a mystical thing sometimes. While there are specific guidelines, some umpires change it a little based on the height or size of the batter. Most of the time, batters swing at these pitches because from the pitchers windup, they thing it will be a strike. They follow the ball usually as it passes the ear of the pitcher (left for a southpaw and right for a righty) Some pitches such as a slider, fake the batter out by appearing to come down the plate, but fall lower than anticipated, hence the name. A change up or off speed pitch do the same to a batter from their view. They believe that they will cross the plate in the strike zone, therefore they take a whack at it but often whiff if they don't realize the style of pitch. Most good batters can tell when an off speed pitch is coming down the pike, and plan for it, holding off or taking a swing. Hope this helps to clear things up. 

Players get ranked based on their performance in tournaments. Per the ITTF ranking page, the ranking system as of 2017 (full details here) incorporates: 

According to this cbafaq.com page, NBA payroll rules can vary by the player's contract, within limits stipulated by the CBA: 

This guide has a few serve & return drills, while this page has a list to various drills for more advanced players. From the list, the defender drills might be of the most interest to you. This YouTube video provides a drill geared towards improving reaction time on defense, while this 2009 NY Times article describes a drill to improve reaction time when discussing a young player: 

According to this training article, bricks are commonly bike/run combos, but there there are also training scenarios for swim/bike combos. 

The challenge of hitting smaller targets with a smaller bat should improve one's hand-eye coordination for all ball-striking sports. For a tennis specific drill, one instructor used the following technique: 

The duties of an assistant head coach vary widely, because each assistant coach on a football team takes on responsibilities that are designated by the head coach of the team. As an analogy of how duties might differ depending on the head coach, many coordinators may have a title, but plays might actually be called by the head coach (due to the head coach's previous offensive or defensive acumen), while other coordinators have handle play-calling, subject to the strategy set by the head coach. As @corsiKa has mentioned, many assistant head coaches can be position coaches, while some coordinators may also serve in this role. From general observation, I've seen that head coaches or team owners might designate an assistant head coach for several reasons: 

Certainly safety would be a consideration. Also it means your board won't go flying in the event that you do fall. If you fall off, your board would continue going down. If you fall with the Velcro then you keep the board with you like a snowboard. 

The majority of the time it is a better plan to draw the penalty then immediately get the 5 on three. This situation actually just came up one the Blackhawks vs Kings games for the Semi Finals of the Stanley Cup. One of the Hawks forwards drew a second penalty in the offensive zone. They pulled the goalie and tried the 4 on 6 for about 25 seconds but had nowhere to go with the puck. Unless an obvious opportunity presented itself, such as one of the King's defensemen was without a stick, it would have been better for them to get the 5 on 3. It gives the primary PP forwards a chance to rest, regroup, and decide how to proceed on the play and hopefully convert. 

There may be products that can help improve reaction time if you're willing to purchase tools - the Newgy Robo-Pong claims to support a variety of drills to improve reaction time for table tennis. (CAVEAT: I've never used this product, so can't determine whether it performs as promised). Finally, this article suggests that visual acuity is closely associated with good reaction times in many sports - make sure that your vision is good (lasik, glasses, contacts, etc.). 

If pace can be considered intensity of the workout, then this article believes that pace should be slowly increased as well: 

In a 4-3 defense, there are two defensive tackles (DT) in the interior of the line, while in a 3-4 defense, there is only one tackle - the nose tackle. Usually, the primary task of the nose tackle is to occupy more than one blocker in the interior of the line to allow linebackers to make plays. In contrast, the role of 4-3 tackles depends heavily on the design of the defense - some 4-3 DT's are pass rushers (example: Warren Sapp) while others also occupy blockers in more of a run-defense role. Vincent Wilfork is listed as an example of a 3-4 Nose Tackles in this Pat Kirwan article on nfl.com. In the same article, Pat Williams is listed as an example of a 4-3 nose tackle. The article describes the roles of these two types of nose tackles: 

It varies by the situation. Some teams send requests to companies to sponsor them, while other times companies ask teams to represent them. Usually it is the latter. In F-1 companies such as MacLaren, the company has ties with tire and parts companies and therefore is able to use those logos and get their products for a greatly reduced price. Some cigarette companies or condom companies would also put their logos on Formula 1 cars in the early years, but not anymore. 

In the situation you describe, according to the MLB Official rules, the runner cannot be considered an interference on that alone. It does, however, fall to the responsibility of the Umpire to determine when play should be stopped for any reason. 

Alright so what I would usually do is take me right foot and motion that I'm going right but actually just draw it over the ball the take it back to my left. Usually works for me. The follow your body movements so when you take it back to your left foot it gives you time to shift your weight quickly depending on your side. Can be reversed depending on the dominant foot. 

You'll need to incorporate weight training and/or intervals in order to maintain (or increase) your muscle mass. A blog post titled "The Running Body Builder" offers some tips: 

Finally, there are anecdotal stories about the increase in young athletes getting injured at higher rates due to sports specialization. One article discusses some of the dangers of specializing in sports at an early age, while another article quotes Pittsburgh Steelers safety Troy Polamalu: 

Yes, tanking has happened in the NBA. In fact, a notorious tanking example was one of the causes of the draft lottery being instituted in the first place. This ESPN article notes: 

From that description, it appears that children that are at least eight years old can start training. Of course, parents know their children best and may be able to start them off at a younger age. 

In one youth baseball hitting drill, the instructors used broomsticks and dried beans instead of bats and baseballs: 

As Rory mentioned, practice will help - this technique is considered to be fairly advanced. Repetition is needed to perfect your technique. If you want some additional training tips, one site suggests: 

I eventually got it down pat, but it took me about 4-6 months. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it immediately. Keep on riding and enjoy the season! 

Most of the time a 'dynasty' refers to a team that has once consistently over a long period of time. Canadian hockey has indeed dominated the international ice for the past decade and become a superpower in the sport. It would be fair to say that their team is running the show when it comes to international ice time, but not necessarily a dynasty, as in competitions they have not always come out on top. It just happens that over the past six years they have built up an extremely strong team. If their streak continues into the next winter olympics, the world 'dynasty' would indeed be used to describe Canada's team. 

That could possibly be considered interference. The initial throw to the third baseman was legal and just a bad throw, with a legal run scoring. On the second throw to home, however, play should have been stopped by the umpire. Once a player is called out they are to return to the dugout directly, but his continuation on the base path was not necessarily an interference (stated below). This means that play should have been stopped and the batter should have been at first. Section 5.02 reads: "5.02 After the umpire calls “Play” the ball is alive and in play and remains alive and in play until for legal cause, or at the umpire’s call of “Time” suspending play, the ball becomes dead. While the ball is dead no player may be put out, no bases may be run and no runs may be scored, except that runners may advance one or more bases as the result of acts which occurred while the ball was alive (such as, but not limited to a balk, an over- throw, interference, or a home run or other fair ball hit out of the playing field)." Although, section 7.09 Paragraph e states: (e) Any batter or runner who has just been put out, or any runner who has just scored, hinders or impedes any following play being made on a runner. Such runner shall be declared out for the interference of his teammate; 

So the final conclusion that he draws is that a sacrifice bunt makes sense only in one situation: man on second, no one out, and a single run is the goal. 

In short, cross-training can provide mental and physical benefits by improving mental health and physical fitness while reducing the risk of injury from overuse. Specializing strictly in one sport may bring about a faster increase in performance, but the articles above suggest that the performance and skill improvements will plateau and may lead to greater injury risks. 

Finally, there is a paid goalie bundle from an online bookstore, focusing on goalie drills. I've never used it, but it may provide the drills that you're looking for (see the first topic). The online blurb notes that the bundle covers these topics: 

If play has not restarted, the referee can change the ruling. However, if play has restarted, no change can be made. EDIT: Changed answer to quote FIFA's Laws of the Game regarding referee decisions. 

Cross-training provides two potential benefits, one mental and one physical. It can potentially reduce the risk of injury and, as others have already mentioned, it can provide some mental benefit by reducing boredom and burnout through different physical activities. As this article notes:
