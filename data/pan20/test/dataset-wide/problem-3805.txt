Dowker codes can be used to get an (over)estimate for the number of knots with $k$ crossings. Hoste has written a few, extremely clear, papers on using Dowker codes for enumeration of knot tables. I don't see how genus could be used - crossing number is an invariant defined in terms of diagrams while genus is much more topological... Very curious! 

Here is a sketch -- some of the details are a bit hazy: Suppose that $\iota$ is a smooth involution of $T^2$. Show that the fixed point set of $\iota$ is a submanifold. Show that the orbit space of $\iota$ is an orbifold with orbifold Euler characteristic zero. Using the orbifold Euler characteristic you can enumerate all 17 compact, connected, 2-dimensional orbifolds of orbifold Euler characteristic zero. Now rule out 12 of these for topological reasons. The second to last step is a nice exercise that everybody should do once, after learning about the orbifold Euler characteristic. The non-trivial part in the last step is eliminating $D(2,2;)$ and $P(2,2)$. Getting rid of the others is easy. 

Edited: The paper Dehn twists have roots proves that Dehn twists have roots, naturally. The limits on that construction can be found in the paper Roots of Dehn twists; they bound the degree of the root (linearly, as I recall) in terms of the complexity of the surface. Now, if I understand correctly, you are asking for ways to realize $\tau_\alpha^p$, a power of a Dehn twist about $\alpha$, as a product of other twists. If we found a root of $\tau_\alpha^p$, which was not itself a twist, then that would answer your question. But I think that the main idea behind the above papers will work. For: any root of $\tau_\alpha^p$ has the same canonical reduction system, namely $\alpha$. So the root of $\tau_\alpha^p$ stabilizes $\alpha$. You can now build a periodic map in the complement of $\alpha$ that does a fractional twist about $\alpha$: for example $p/q$ fraction of a right twist. Take the $q$-power of this get the desired $\tau_\alpha^p$. Note that it is far from clear that these constructions are the only way to get a subgroup $H$ of the type you desire. 

I'll guess that these new objects (basically, cosets) will do everything you want, while avoiding dangerous mucking about with wacky embeddings. For example, computing distance in $X$ reduces to three distance computations in $\SO(3)$. 

Here is what springs to mind: break the proof into two lectures. The first lecture proves that Dehn twists generate the pure spherical braid group. The second lecture gives enough of Lickorish's proof to show that you can send any oriented non-separating curve to any other such. Finally induct on genus. The first lecture gives the base case. For the induction step appeal to Alexander's trick. 

Bisimularity of graphs arises in geometric topology. See "Quasi-isometric classification of graph manifold groups" by Behrstock and Neumann. 

For a pleasant introduction that includes many beautiful pictures, I suggest the book "Indra's Pearls" by Mumford, Series, and Wright. They also give examples of explicit computation of the relevant matrices. Here's a link to the copy at Google books. 

The circle action $(z,w) \mapsto (e^{2i\theta}z, e^{3i\theta}w)$ has all orbits, except two, isotopic to the trefoil. I'm guessing that the exceptional orbits correspond to the square lattice and the hexagonal lattice. Further, I'm thinking that the degenerate lattices land on a single orbit, proving that the "space of lattices" is identical to the trefoil complement. Ah - looking at Ghys' lecture, I see that he says all of this. Well, it is still pretty cool. Edit: However, this tells you that there are Hopf orbits that cross the set of degenerate lattices exactly twice. This makes a nice answer to your question unlikely? 

Suppose that we are given a PL map from a handlebody $W$ to a handlebody $V$. Choose a spine for $W$. Homotope the map until the image is a regular neighborhood of the image of the spine. By general position, our map is now an embedding. Fix a pants decomposition of disks $D = (D_i)$, for $V$. Suppose that $P$ is a component of $V - D$ (so $P$ is a three-ball with three distinguished disks on its boundary). Consider a component $X$ of $f(W) \cap P$. This is essentially a knotted graph. Via a homotopy (keeping $X \cap D$ fixed) unknot $X$. If the rank of $X$ is positive then another homotopy produces small lollipops which we shall compress a bit later. If $X$ meets any disk $D_i \subset \partial P$ more than once then we may homotope a leg of $X$ through $D_i$. Let $Y$ be the resulting component of $f(W) \cap P$. (Note that this reduces $f(W) \cap D$.) Homotoping in this fashion we eventually arrive at an embedding of $W$ so that every component in every three-ball of $V - D$ is either a tripod or an interval, possibly with lollipops attached. The feet of the tripod/interval lie in distinct disks in the boundary of the containing solid pants. Now compress all of the lollipops to get $f'(W')$ (a new handlebody, because we compressed and a new map because we have to extend it over the two-handles we added). EDIT: This reproduces, in our context, part of Stallings paper (eg sliding the leg is a fold, arriving at only tripods and intervals produces an immersion.) Since $f'$ is an immersion, it follows from Stallings paper that $f'$ is $\pi_1$ injective and that $W'$ embeds into a finite cover of $V$. 

EDIT: Perhaps your question is best answered with another question - "relatively hyperbolic with respect to what kinds of subgroups?" I wrote my answer assuming that the subgroups of interest are the JSJ and peripheral tori. HJRW's answer further allows the fundamental groups of graph-manifold pieces of the JSJ decomposition. Here is what I originally wrote. Suppose that $K$ is a satellite knot where both the companion knot $C$ and the pattern link $P$ are hyperbolic. Then $K$ is not hyperbolic itself, but $\pi_1(S^3 - K)$ is relatively hyperbolic with respect to the images of the peripheral tori of $C$ and $P$. If $\Gamma$ is a torus link group then $\Gamma$ is weakly relatively hyperbolic with respect to its centre $Z(\Gamma)$, but not relatively hyperbolic with respect to $Z(\Gamma)$. I believe that this is an obstruction, in general. So, one answer to your question is: A knot group is relatively hyperbolic with respect to its JSJ and peripheral tori if and only if all of the pieces of its JSJ decomposition are hyperbolic. It certainly can happen that hyperbolic knot groups have other "relatively hyperbolic structures" (eg using a quasi-fuchsian surface subgroup). So perhaps we can use similar surfaces for a similar purpose in satellite knots. 

Construction: Consider $A$, a flat annulus, of width $W$ and length $L$. Here we assume that $W$ is very large and $L$ is very small. (That is, take a $W$ by $L$ rectangle and glue the long sides.) Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the components of $\partial A$. We glue many sub-intervals in $\alpha$ to isometric sub-intervals in $\beta$, via some complicated permutation. This gives a high genus surface $S$. The singular points all live in a graph -- namely the image of $\partial A$ after taking the quotient. (In fancier language: $S$ is the suspension of an interval exchange transformation.) Proof: Note that the diameter of $S$ is at most $(W+L)/2$. However, any geometric triangulation must have at least two edges crossing $A$ and these edges have length at least $W$. So we are done. $\newcommand{\diam}{\mbox{diam}}$I actually I tried to prove that the answer was "yes" before realizing that there are counterexamples. One natural way provide a "yes" answer is via the Delaunay triangulation. This lead me to Theorem 4.4 of the paper "Hausdorff dimension of sets of nonergodic measured foliations" by Masur and Smillie. They define $d(S)$ to be the maximal distance of a non-singular point $x \in S$ to the set of singularities $\Sigma \subset S$. Note that $d(S) \leq \diam(S)$. Their Theorem 4.4 says that all of the Delaunay polygons in $S$ can be inscribed in a disk of radius at most $d(S)$. Thus the length of any Delaunay edge is at most $2 \cdot d(S)$. 

EDIT - Following the suggestions of several people I have, somewhat painfully, switched from what is described below to using just pdflatex and pinlabel. I still use xfig for figures, exporting them to both eps and pdf to make pinlabel happy. Old answer - I draw knots in a different program (xfig), save them as eps files, and then include them via 

Perhaps you are thinking of the recognition problem for the three-sphere? There are theorems of Aleksandar Mijatovic (Simplifying triangulations of $S^3$) and Simon King (How to make a triangulation of $S^3$ polytopal) that say: If $T$ is a triangulation of $S^3$ with at most $n$ tetrahedra then you need at most $f(n)$ "operations" to transform $T$ into a "standard" triangulation. The function $f$, the operations, and the definition of standard vary between the two papers. I believe that the result is a very simple but very slow (doubly exponential) algorithm to recognize the three-sphere. The proofs, at the very end of the day, rely on normal surface theory and the Rubinstein/Thompson algorithm. 

Suppose that $c = \gamma^n$ in $\pi_1(X)$. Note that, as $\pi_1(X)$ is torsion free and $c$ is assumed to be non-trivial, the element $\gamma$ generates an infinite cyclic subgroup $\langle \gamma \rangle < \pi_1(X)$. Let $A = X^\gamma$ be the cover of $X$ corresponding to the subgroup $\langle \gamma \rangle$. So $\pi_1(A)$ is also infinite cyclic. Since $X$ is orientable, so is $A$. It follows from the classification of surfaces $A$ is a (non-compact) annulus. Note that $\gamma$ can be lifted to $A$ and this lift, $\gamma'$, is homotopic to the core curve of $A$. Likewise $c$ lifts to a curve $c'$ and we have $c' = (\gamma')^n$ in $\pi_1(A)$. Since $c$ is simple in $X$ the lift $c'$ is simple in $A$. By the intermediate value theorem (sort of!) the only simple curves in $A$ are isotopic to the trivial curve and to the core curve. Thus $n = \pm 1$ and we are done. 

$\DeclareMathOperator{\SO}{SO}$$\DeclareMathOperator{\RP}{RP}$$\DeclareMathOperator{\Stab}{Stab}$There is a difference between the sets $C = [-1,1]^3$ and $E = [0,1]^3$. Note that $\Stab(C)$, the stabilizer of $C$ inside of $\SO(3)$, is called the cube group and it has 24 elements. Note that $\Stab(E)$ has three elements. 

You haven't said why you are looking for this, beyond mentioning a computational application. There are lots of embedding theorems (eg the Whitney embedding theorem) and there are ways to describe the induced metrics. These will (almost certainly) be useless for computational purposes. Probably you will be much happier with the following much simpler approach. Encode elements of $X = \SO(3)/\Stab(E)$ as objects $[M]$ where 

[See Peter Scott's Bulletin article for more information.] Typically, we say an orbifold $Q$ is hyperbolic if it comes to us as a quotient of hyperbolic space $H^n$ by the action of a discrete group $G$ of isometries. If the action $G$ is cocompact then $G$ will be a Gromov hyperbolic group. This is the "easy direction". On the other hand, if $Q$ is an orbifold with enough topological hypotheses (for example, dimension three, irreducible, "good" as Agol says, perhaps more...) then, if the orbifold fundamental group of $Q$ is Gromov hyperbolic it follows from the geometrization theorem (Perelman and so on) that $Q$ is orbifold homeomorphic to a quotient as in the first paragraph. So, roughly, the two notions are equivalent. However one direction is easy -- it follows from basic definitions in the field of coarse geometry -- and the other direction is one of the most famous recent results in mathematics. 

$\newcommand{\Sym}{\operatorname{Sym}}$The answer is above, in the comment by Stefan Behrens -- I am just adding this to make some robot happy. The $k$-fold symmetric product $\Sym^k$ of a space $C$ (minus the big diagonal $\Delta$) is the "configuration space" of distinct unlabelled $k$-tuples of points in $C$. After fixing a basepoint $(c_i)$, a loop in $\Sym^k(C)$ is a one-parameter family of $k$-tuples - so it is a union of $k$ non-intersecting arcs in $C$ that start and end at the $c_i$. Accordingly we call $\pi_1(\Sym^k(C) - \Delta)$ the $k$-strand braid group in $C$. Note that there is a homomorphism from $\pi_1(\Sym^k(C) - \Delta)$ to the symmetric group on the indices $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$. If $C$ is a surface, then sometimes the phrase surface braid group is used. If $C$ is the complex plane, then we obtain the standard braid group. 

$\newcommand{\ZZ}{\mathbb{Z}}$For your first question: the Baumslag-Solitar group $BS = BS(2,3)$ is not residually finite, so cannot embed in a three-manifold group. Thus $BS \times \ZZ$ has a balanced presentation, but is not a three-manifold group. A nice two-generator example is $\ZZ/3\ZZ \times \ZZ$. (For both examples, my proofs rely on geometrization. But see HJRW's comments below.) For your second question: As Ryan says, the program Heegaard is our friend here. There is extensive documentation explaining the algorithm. It operates on the Whitehead graph of the given presentation. The algorithm performs a sequence Whitehead moves until it either gives up or it makes the Whitehead graph planar. If there is now a good "pairing" of the vertices then the algorithm has produced a Heegaard splitting of the desired three-manifold. Finally: see page 47, item C.4 of the book 3-manifold groups for a list of interesting references.
