Per request I quote important parts from Wikipedias articles on Sidestroke1 and the Combat Sidestroke2 the US Navy developed from it. The basic sidestroke is a swimming technique that is good for long distance swimming.1 

I am currently trying to progress on both the hundred push ups and the one fifty dips programs. I cannot do them on the same day of course, they both put a huge strain on my triceps. And while reading some other question on this site I stumbled across a link saying: 

I read multiple times that the body gets used to certain exercises and will adapt to them, so the training effect for doing the same exercise minimizes. And although two quite similar exercises will often train the same muscles, they use them in different ways. At the moment I have basically two groups of exercises that I switch weekly. I do the first groups of exercises in one week and the next groups of exercises in the other week. There are some exercises I do in both weeks. I wonder if it is a good approach to reduce adaption. Should I switch in another cycle; every exercise day, only every two weeks or even less? 

Not really, eating more wont help you to lose weight. There are some studies that suggest that a diet high in protein might be beneficial when trying to lose weight. But to make use of this, you still have to reduce your total caloric intake. Protein supplements make it easier to reach protein levels that classify as a high-protein diet, but they still count towards your daily caloric intake. However, supplements are supplements, they should not be used as substitutes for real meals. I would advise always to consume as much protein through your normal diet. Supplements are not inherently bad, but they lack nutrients present in natural food sources. (And cheap supplements might even be contaminated due to bad manufacturing conditions) 

There are a lot of diets and a lot of claims. A lot of them are simply not true. The problem with pasta, rice, potatoes and bread is that they are high in carbohydrates and by that high in calories. If you want to lose weight (and by that reducing the fat that covers your abs), you should try to keep your caloric intake below what you burn each day. How you reach your daily limit does not really matter, as long as your diet doesn't lack crucial nutrients. You should also note that people (and by that the articles they write) often think of different things when they talk about the same stuff. The bread I think about is certainly something completely different as someone else thinks about. Cutting alcohol is a good idea, too, as it contains a lot of calories. Drinking less alcohol is always a good idea when looking from a health perspective. Of course your abs won't develop themselves, I am not sure if cardio alone is enough. Try to incorporate some exercises into your workout that target the abs, at least in a compound style exercise. And always be wary of the spot reduction myth. 

I consider the lower part to be the harder part of the movement as this targets the lats mostly. The upper part seems to train the arms more. For me it is the whole movement is what I am trying to get better at, so assisted pull ups are not really an option. I think Johnny Pain is right here, at least to some point. Assisted pull ups are probably better to train for pull ups than doing nothing, but as long as your lats are your weak point in the pull up movement, you should look for another exercise that makes it easier to train them. 

The Wikipedia article gives a lot of other reasons why BMI is inaccurate for a single person to determine their health. BMI is mostly useful for statistical comparison of groups of people: 

I think you should approach them like you should approach everyone who does something in a way you don't agree with (or don't understand): with respect and without prejudice. In my opinion (not a crossfitter): Kipping pull-ups are a different exercise than strength focused pull-ups. They focus primarily on explosive movement and the clever use of inertia. The goal of crossfit, as I understand, is real-world application of the movement. For climbing a normal pull-up is useful, but you don't always want to do something elegant and clean, but simple and quick and just jerk your body up. 

This depends a bit on the kind of exercises you do. There is a little debate in the fitness community if exercising in the morning with or without prior breakfast has an effect on fat loss. The theory is that your glycogen levels are low and your body has to burn fat to compensate. However as far as I recall research could not show that this is true. So back to the exercise, what definitely is true is that your glycogen levels are somewhat lower after sleeping. If your exercise is only a jog around the block for some minutes, this probably does not matter. If it is a full weightlifting routine or a prolonged cardio session (eg running for an hour) you will probably feel exhausted easily without a prior meal. On the other hand a full stomach might also have negative effects on your workout. Some people (including myself) don't like working out with a full stomach or even get nauseous. So the decision you have to make here is what you like more; working out with a full or an empty stomach. You could also eat something before and the rest afterwards. Splitting meals has the advantage that you might want to eat less, which can come in handy if you are trying to lose weight. For the other actions: Go to the toilet when you need to, I would do that as first thing in the morning, as a full bladder doesn't feel good and you gain nothing by holding stuff in. Take the shower after your workouts, unless you want to annoy people. 

BMI tables might vary, for example there are other values used for children or even for people from different nations. These values are, as stated above, only a rough measure, some people with completely good health might fall into the overweight categories easily when they are for example very tall athletes. 

I didn't really feel that I get a training effect if I could only do one good form pull up in a row. So as my exercise was really lacking a pulling motion, I found Inverted Rows to be a great way to work my way up to pull ups and chin ups. Combining the often heard pull up rule "If you can only do one, do them as often as you can" and inverted rows in different variations improved my ability to do consecutive pull ups and chin ups drastically. You can do inverted rows nearly everywhere, either over or underhand. At the gym you could hang a barbell into a rack and get below (depends on the rack and its placement to the wall of course). If you want to do them at home, you can lie below a table and pull yourself up. Of course the angle of the pulling motion isn't exactly the same as with a pull up, but contrary to a barbell row, still facing upwards. 

I can only guess wildly. Maybe because the body burns energy stored in the muscles first and after a certain amount of time the body starts to refill them, which increases the energy needed. Are there differences in the way the body burns calories after a specific amount of time? Or asked in another way: Is there a difference between running for 3x10 minutes with pauses in between or running 30 minutes in one go (assuming all other conditions, pace, total distance, etc, the same). 

If you want to loose weight and want to get rid of excess fat, you should change what you eat and how. Reduce the Calories you consume, you could start by adding more vegetables to your diet and eat regularly. If you want to add muscle by weightlifting you should have a look at StrongLifts 5x5. It is a beginner weightlifting programs that takes a linear approach to weightlifting. I have only used some aspects of the program as I don't workout in a gym and don't have a barbell myself, but a lot of people here on fitness.SE are convinced of it. You don't have to take supplements, I am convinced that you can achieve your goals without. Some people might find it problematic to adjust their diet to account for their increased protein needs and prefer to supplement with protein shakes. The same counts for Vitamins. I prefer to adjust my diet, supplements are pretty expensive compared to regular food sources. Loosing fat from the face is not necessarily a bad thing, it is the first place where I lost fat, too. When I began my fitness craze it was the first thing people noticed. 

I was looking for a general guideline as I am to purchase an exercise-ball online. According to this article: 

A minimalist running shoe would be optimal, but I doubt that you should invest in one of those just to try forefoot striking. You can run and walk on your forefoot in every shoe, although the rigid sole or heavy cushioning might make things complicated. I started running on my forefoot last fall, the shoes I used weren't even proper running shoes (more like general purpose field and track shoes). Although this is not optimal, it worked for me. If you have normal running shoes you should be able to use them. However you will feel a difference when switching to minimalist shoes. On your first run you should not try to even get close to distances you ran before, just try to run one mile or less. The leg has to adapt to the new technique as some muscles that haven't been used before are now put under stress. As you just started running this issue might not be as big, but I suspect you didn't walk an our forefoot and thus those specific muscles are probably still weaker than the rest of your normal running muscles. Bottom line: Try to switch to forefoot running for a short distance in one of your normal runs and see how it feels like. If you like it and want to get more serious about it, buy minimalist shoes. Alternatively you could try running completely without shoes as this will make you run on your forefoot automatically.
