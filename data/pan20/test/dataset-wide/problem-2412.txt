Whereas Right Mindfulness involves more momentary concentration, momentary mindfulness to check up and make sure that the Right Efforts are happening. They are not mutually exclusive although theoretically speaking, either of these things cultivated to an extreme could obviate the need to do the other. 

Depending on your goals with Buddhism, frequent masturbation is generally violating that precept because it harms the body. Frequent masturbation is all sorts of sexual misconduct and harms the body-mind: 

Entering the 4th jhana (the most focused of the four) is best before doing focused insight practice (vipassana) The immaterial jhanas are related to some of the Stages of Insight (achieving one can spontaneously lead to the other) but I have never seen it recommended in reference to Vipassana practice. Bavo Lievens was saying in his book that apparently some people who have never cultivated the form jhanas can spontaneously experience some of the formless jhanas! This would make sense why certain drugs (e.g. marijuana, shrooms) lead to states that feel like descriptions of the formless jhanas but do not have the stability and clarity of the form jhanas. I've actually seen it said in some places that the formless jhanas can be distractive due to their more permanent, expansive nature, making it harder to see the 3 characteristics. The "form" jhanas on the other hand lead to a centered state of mind which readily allows penetrative clarity into the 3 characteristics, the essence of vipassana and Awakening and disentangling the chain of suffering. 

I do not know if he paraphrased and I could not find it with a Google search... he was saying the idea that Buddha died from eating bad pork was incorrect. He was vaguely referencing mushrooms as a possible cause and then also mentioned that Buddha died through some supernatural phenomenon and this was in some Pali sutta. I was wondering if anyone knew where this quote is from (and hence the rest of the story)? 

Did the relationship fall apart because there was something lacking within yourself? If so you can cultivate that piece and try to win her back (lots of guides on the internet for techniques on this because women often validate in non one-on-one interaction)... or if you determine what was lacking is not worth it to you... it is not part of your life mission... then you need to look for the woman that values what you have/will have. For example, some of the women that my reptilian brain finds beautiful, wonderful and warm, I know are horrible choices for a partner because all they care about is alcohol, money, and novelty. Straight up, there are a lot of nice women like that, even within the Buddhist circle. Sometimes it is also self-sabotage... and you are not even aware of it. My first long-term relationship, I withdrew emotionally because I saw that she did not care much for my spiritual conversations. She lit up at everything else but when I talked about Buddhism, Taoism, etc., due to her childhood experiences, she did not care much for it. Eventually I withdrew emotionally, going through the motions but not feeling the emotions any longer. I was already disconnected but did not know it. When she could not find the appreciation/love from me, she broke it off with me and I suffered. Only many years later did I realize that I was clinging to her out of habit and not because I actually liked her any more. I FELT for her out of habit--something I could not let go of because I kept revisiting her in mind and conversation. Despite her nice physical features, I should have ended the relationship the moment I realized our values were so horribly misaligned. All the past, all the pleasure: empty dreams. Maybe a lesson but not the right person either of each other. Are you in the midst of something like that and you just don't know it because the chronic emotions are there (emotions are a chemical addiction)? Do you two have a meaningful QUEST together? Buddhism teaches that everything is causes and conditions including yourself, and including other women. Think objectively and measure out what kind of person you are really looking for. What kind of person will be happy with you and you with her? Don't attach to the story (high school lovers, etc.). The story does not matter. Shared values, ideals, and practices matter a lot. That's the end of my rambling but here are so other important, obvious tips to your main question: 

Yes they are synonyms but like every synonym there is a fine difference: the dharmakaya (dharmmakaya) refer to the non-physical component of the Trikaya I find the dharmakaya to be a more useful understanding because it helps to contrasts the mental component of Buddhist practice with the physical component of Buddhist/Taoist practice (chi channels, chakras, kundalini, warmth, Taoist practices, etc.). This can help your practice because one principle of Mind is that the body and mind are in sync and follow each other: if you train/purify the body, you also train/purify the mind... to a certain point. This rupakaya development has its limits and that is why the dharmakaya is helpful to be contrasted. The rupakaya goes very deep into the physical powers and improvements listed in Buddhism from just basic health to creating full on Taoist yang shen bodies (nirmanakaya). Anyway, it is more important to understand the contrast between the rupakaya and dharmakaya and focus on cultivating dharmakaya, because this is literally Reality. Ways to cultivate this tend to be non-physical, which in terms of self-actualization, means: achieving samadhis, prajnas, and stages described in the texts (through whatever method). That is the lesson that the word "dharmakaya" teaches, which is why I like that term to help understand different practices. The Tathagatagarbha refers to the "womb" of reality/"Buddha"... basically Buddha-nature, basically dharmakaya. In other sense: the Tathagatagarbha refers to a group of sutras for the most part, the Tathagatagarbha Sutras, but also to the Buddha-nature itself. Nonetheless, it is disputed whether buddha-nature = Tathagatagarbha: the tathagatagarbha is thus described in Wikipedia: According to Wikipedia, the Tathagatagarbha: 

Yes, Noumenon is our Tathagata nature, our Buddha Nature, Tao, God, Allah, Brahmin... whatever that thing is that is beyond the dualism of existence and non-existence: the Mind. Noumenon is the opposite of phenomena, things that are perceivable through the senses or in Buddhist terms are a part of the five skandhas (see Surangama Sutra). This is why it is so important to become more detached from phenomena because they detract the Buddhist from realizing the only worthy goal of the Noumenon, the Source of all things, the Us that is beyond time and space. The more one develops a worldly way, the more one is attached to meaning-ful phenomena be it money, sensual pleasure, relationships, and the infinite dualities that trap us to the wheel. The more one grows in the spiritual path, the more one is able to perceive the foundational unity of all things. The profound truth in Emptiness. One is unable to be so attached to any particular thing--not with a numbness, but with a crystal clear clarity developed through the understanding of Dharma and most importantly through the transformation of consciousness itself that takes place by success in meditation/awareness/vipassana. This is the Right Path as espoused by the Eightfold Path and the last question you asked is different question, that would take an entire paper to discuss, but basically yes. 

In comparison to the path towards ignorant self-destruction yes, Buddhism looks like "no fun"--even though it is the way to True Bliss and Freedom. But don't worry there are extremely loose forms of Buddhism (which almost don't count) and tighter forms of Buddhism (Theravada), many of the moral rules are hard to practice today. Also, I think you have a very superficial definition of fun. Buddhists are allowed to go to parties, have multiple partners so long as it is not "sexual misconduct"--Buddhism is actually truly scientific and logical. None of the practices are faith based unlike Western religions where one will have to be even more tightly disciplined to follow the religion to a tee. Among the Eastern practices, Buddhism is actually the middle way and there are even higher paths that lead to (a few) other benefits, namely of rupakaya. These paths require even more worldly sacrifice yet are not essential therefore Buddha did not speak of them. 

Try watching a documentary about the Illuminati, "The American Dream" cartoon on Youtube for instance. It will disillusion you from the left-right paradigm which is designed to make us combat each other rather than the establishment itself. Politics literally means the study of the people. As such, doing something truly good through politics is what a bodhisattva would do. On the other hand, most of our minds are too clouded to make a change in the right place and time. It would be good to go to a protest, help fund an actually anti-establishment politician (like Ron Paul)... but it gets tricky. Trump claimed to be anti-establishment but here he is completely bought out. After you learn more about the system at its core, including fractional reserve banking... you will see how it is doomed for failure and maybe make preparations. To be forcibly un-involved from politics is to hide under a rock--but definitely do not get mired in the details. 

No not necessarily because Youtube is not synonymous with entertainment although the masses do use it for this aim. In fact, Youtube is one of the best learning programs in existence. With all the video tutorials and such. Also, use an adblocker. It DOES go against mental self-cultivation to be exposed to all the inappropriate content on the internet including blatant advertisements and sex appeal. It will unsettle you and break your vows to be exposed to all sorts commentary and "sexual education" material as well. Focus on Buddhadharma videos and videos relelvant to your particular trade (e.g. business, cooking, product development, etc.). Another thing, customize your feeds. If you do not customize your feeds you will not get the particular educational programs that you are looking for (if you're a java programmer, java feeds will show up, thus improving Right Livelihood). 

Thus, even though I am Buddhist I don't run away from Islam. I fully embrace it and espouse the half-muslims to actually practice it because it has many health benefits. I go to mosque when I can and when I am required to with my family and community and I integrate Buddhist science of spiritual practice to practice with single-minded mindfulness and not the ignorant desire-filled prayer most people probably do. Buddhism is a religion that is fully integrated within my Islamic community and if I speak about Buddhism I speak about it without ever mentioning the word Buddhism or Buddha. I merely reference the practices such as yoga and meditation and pranayama which are nondenominational and conducive to the actual reason for namaj (improve concentration and oneness with Allah--a concentration object). Thus, when I speak about Islamic practices, I find myself always integrating the nondenominational, spiritual principles of Buddhism within the structure of Islam. Islam is a great religion and can be fully subsumed into the spiritual science of Buddhism. Practice the Buddhist virtue of modesty and let no one know of your attainments and your vigorous concentration practice. Mentally discard silly Islamic/religious that you know by Buddhadharma are only created to help people stay doubt-free and cultivating practice concept and enjoy spiritual practice with your community! Use the phrases and phrases you learned from within Islam. Display complete devotion to Islam and spiritual science in general. Islam isn't that complicated at all... it is easy to blend in and be spiritual, continue to use the Buddhadharma but always appear Muslim by practicing Right Speech within your community. 

Although suicide is performed visually in these practices, none of these Buddhist practices lead to such a behavior if done in a neutral, matter-of-fact manner. In fact, there are myriad benefits to regular practice and it is one of the 3 most important buddhist practices. The reason for this is the same reason as you would imagine yourself during your job interview and imagine what will happen: you will be more informed and ready long before it happens. In no way, should you be depressed. In fact you should be almost happy and light and free, shedding your body and thinking of what is most important in this post-mortem state: vipassana, concentration, morality--the Three Trainings of Buddhism! So, when you do this "skeleton meditation", you start off with accepting the suddenness of death and realizing the importance of energy and time. Next you go on step by step through the points, imagining your corpse filling up with pus, bursting, and eventually your flesh being exposed and rotting away until you are just a skeleton. Here is a very special instructional on how to practice this Buddhist technique to improve your chi levels alongside with history and gong-fu anecdotes. The author of the article has a lot of other free articles but this is not one of them--he just forgot to protect the link and I am sharing here. Anyway, it will answer all your other questions about practice schedule and will help you understand this ancient practice in a modern, holistic light. 

Once again, I argue against this, since the 7th and 8th level of consciousness do not correlate entirely to "intention"... we cannot say that namarupa is a precise enough (or even late enough) to include these other layers which are actually worked on at the highest stages towards Complete Buddhahood and are described more in the Mahayana than in Theravada! 

Books are the way to go. There is simply no substitute. I recommend Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha to develop a pragmatic Theravadin perspective with an "American" bite to it. It also educates you on how to evaluate other traditions. 

Having the tongue pressed against the roof is standard practice through all traditions. This is basic meditation advice, part of 9-step preparation for meditation, because of the way the chi channels connect, this is good for one's health and growth. Clenching one's teeth on the other hand I have only read in the suttas as a "last resort" in eliminating and resisting distractions/temptations. It should be taken as a literary device expressing the Buddha's compassion for our suffering and his urging for us to head straight to what we seek, rather than be side-tracked. 

Sure... It might even expand your perception of "luck" so you can recognize the positive events that are always present but go ignored because we are the universe loving kindnessly bounded to ecah other through unconditional conditions... 

--from Conception Skandha part of Chapter 5 of William Bodri's book "How to Measure and Deepen Your Spiritual Realization" In Taoism, this is equivalent to the state where your shen is full and you will no longer be able to sleep. Many practitioners at this stage (Buddhist, Taoist, or Christian) when they achieve this level of "mental clarity" (a little bit of shen) cannot sleep for days and wonder if they are going crazy. (The solution to this common issue, which happened to me last night, is to just use that special time to do calming meditation some more. Don't worry too much about worldly sleep [unless you are experiencing Zen sickness, which is a similar phenomenon that is best faced by taking some sleep medicine to forgo brain damage through over-creativity].) 

-- Now, I am assuming that you did look into explanations there above. Now are full of understanding of the 5 Stages of the Spiritual Path that are common to all cultivation schools. Now you know for sure that the spiritual path is something beyond any prayer to any deity... it is developing Pure Presence and cultivating other features of Being-As-Is. Now, I would like to tell you that despite the fact that various cultural streams have many of the same features as Buddhism... and even similar or even equivalent practices... (Early) Buddhism is still better. It is the most organized, systematic method available. Buddhism, especially Theravadin Buddhism, is the "only" direct path. It is what the Buddha first spoke after all...! It contains within it the bare essentials to practice -- the "extras" are supportive practices like to improve your morality practice Brahmavihara. Although it may seem that some sects in some religions are exclusive, all the various methods within Buddhism and in all religions--fall under the 8/9 samadhi/dhyana/jhana that our Lord Buddha experimented with and shared. "The Surangama Sutra" or the more adaptable "Twenty-Five Doors to Meditation - A Handbook to Entering Samadhi" both expand and explain this in a practical way.
