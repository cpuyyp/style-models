The really hard trick is defining what humanities best interests are so that the machine "has humankind and the Earth's welfare at heart". There are many popular mutually exclusive views on what is best for humankind that people hold today. Pick any major political dispute at its core is usually the difference between 2 or more such views. Your AI will have to pick a definition and everyone who does not share that definition will reject the AI and everyone who agrees with it will use it. You could have a different AI for every major political view and have each leader use his or her favorite. You could also strip out the value judgment from the AI which makes it basically a computer, which is what the government uses to get data today. 

If it's stupid but works, it isn't stupid. Professional are predictable, the world is filled with dangerous amateurs. 

A crash landing would cause irreparable damage to the ship. Additionally, some people might actually want to leave the ship and seek a new life. (This is the purpose of returning to earth anyway.) With out some logistics and trade, maintaining advanced tech could become incredibly difficult and impractical. As far as other aspects, rather than post an extended answer, I think I will simply that that just because humans lack iPads doesn't mean they can't survive brilliantly. Being human also entails a knack for surviving and adapting. Now those links contain stories where humans live on despite a scarcity of natural resources, although with great suffering. But if a ship crash landed in a fertile area, humans would have a distinct advantage over local fauna, who would be adjusted yet because their natural predator or prey instincts wouldn't yet be adapted to a human presence after such an extended absence. Meaning that human wouldn't be looked at as prey by predators, nor as predators by prey. A hunter-gatherer society would do quite well for itself so long as it ranged far to avoid depleting nearby resources. Humanity could in fact thrive. 

What is the minimum amount of handwaveium to get atmosphere and gravity? Well we have already introduced ludicrous quantities of handwaveium so its not hard to just hand wave the rest. Just to build a cable that connects two planets and is stable we have had to introduce an indestructible handwavium cable several times longer than the circumference of earth holding a significant fraction of the weight of 2 planets. Since we are handwaving a bridge material of almost infinite straight lets hand wave it does not stretch significantly. Atmosphere not much more We build a handwaveium tube around the outside of the cable to hold in the atmosphere. Okay but gravity will pull air down out of the tube onto the two planets. So we need air locks that segment the tube to reduce the pressure planet side and trap atmosphere in the tube. These would be paired with modern day air filtration and co2 scrubbing systems. You would also need pumps to gradually move air back toward the middle as it drifts downward whenever the airlocks transition Gravity Lots more Lets assume you mean gravity pulling you toward the center of the cable. (you get gravity pulling toward the planets for free). Why do you want this? In the normal case you climb a ladder out of planets 1 gravity well then drift effortlessly several hundred thousand miles in 0 gravity then climb down a ladder into planet 2. Why get gravity just to walk the several hundred thousand miles in-between? If you want it anyway there are 3 methods 

A simple huge loss of population If 95% of the population is gone and the rest is scattered around the world and can't get along (raiders, different factions,...), I doubt the world will progress much, especially if past technology is hard to recover and resources are scarce. Concerning the potential causes of such events, a virus is a good candidate. It can kill a lot of people and have a huge effect of area denial (quarantined areas) that can prevent people from accessing fertile lands for crops, lakes and rivers for water or any kind of resource. This virus could potentially affect plants and kill a lot of common crops. This would keep the struggle for survival constant and a lot of rivalries would occur, especially around viable land. 

In other words, however numerous and skilled the hounds, they never see the world as a fox. Starting with a precept that criminals will cleverly hack and subvert a system, using the Man's technology against Him is a rather academic view of people whom generally aren't. Practicality rules. And using tech in any way would tend to give an edge to law enforcement, not the other way around. The creator of technology always knows it better than a user, even a smart one. The Man makes/funds tech, criminals will almost always just be users who found a crack in the wall. And anyway, technology aside, as I understand it, according to Mitnick, the best hacks have always been via social engineering, not device exploitation, though it helps sometimes. For reference on your subject, check out the original Stainless Steel Rat trilogy by Harry Harrison. The series explores the topic of future criminals. 

In a futuristic setting, nations have invented a way to create armor just a bit heavier than cloth. This would be worn like chainmail and would be available widely. I am looking for a way to make this somewhat realistic and avoid deus ex machina as much as possible. 

Assuming you could combine these elemental shards to make more complex machines, you could create railguns. You use air shards for electricity to power up your railgun and earth shards for projectiles like tungsten with ferromagnetic rings. Because of the high velocity of their projectiles, you can hit any kind of vehicle (planes, boats or land vehicles) from really far away. The main problems for a railgun are rate of fire and energy consumption. You could make smaller railguns with permanent magnets instead of charged rails to remove the need of air shards and potentially increase the rate of fire. This would however reduce power and range, which would complement the bigger railguns. You could also use lasers which would only use air shards (for gas and electricity). They would have very good range but would require a lot of power and continuous exposure. They could potentially be deflected easily as well though. You could use shards themselves as land mines and for area denial, but winds might not be in your favour and push the toxic fumes towards the city you're trying to protect. Speaking of which, you could create elemental mines using different shards. For basic guns, this would probably use air and earth shards (propellant and projectile) A big problem with all of these weapons is damage done to them as damaged shards would kill or seriously injure the user and people around it. 

"It takes a thief to catch a thief." I don't know who coined it, but the saying seems generally accepted as true, and highlights a commonly perceived obstacle in law enforcement, that a law abiding officer -- which, I must assume, is one reason to have a robot police force, so ideally human sin and error are minimized -- however skilled, simply does have a criminal mindset. Professional criminals perceive the entire world differently, so adaption will likely be in unexpected, criminally brilliant ways. However, there are also criminals who inadvertently outwit the law, and by unconscious heuristics subvert the system, and not by being very intelligent, but intuitively or by plain luck. For example, if robot/people cops only use the newest and best technology, and the fortunate criminal keeps using his or her legacy system for communication, either by chance or some belief that it's 'lucky,' such a criminal would be very difficult to catch, especially in an advanced society. So long as no major blunders were made at least. Another way of saying this is, what if it never occurs to cops in a future society to read snail mail? I think two things from Murphy's Law of Combat are parallel to the criminal mindset which cause untold trouble to law enforcement, which make criminals difficult to handle, regardless of technology: 

Their body would require tremendous force to move through sand relatively quickly and it should be able to withstand the pressure of all that mass of sand above them. Other than that, I do not doubt on the ability of their scales to resist sand "grind" while moving. By the way, some reptiles already have a second eyelid. I think they would move more easily if they dug with their frontal claws rather than "swimming". 

I think either your continent would have to be bigger to cover all of these climates or your planet would have to be smaller, but it wouldn't be Earth-like anymore (different weight, gravity, magnetic field,...) I think making the continent slightly bigger might help, but you could play with altitude and landscape. Lower altitudes (Varn) would be tropical, medium altitudes would be more temperate and higher altitudes (Frost) would be colder. You could also play with marine currents, a bit like the Gulf Stream, to "heat up" a part of your continent. This current could be linked to another land, bringing heat when that land is hot and not bringing anything when that land is cold. 

Are teleporters duplicators? Say I teleport from A to B and station C is in the middle can C generate a copy of me without disrupting the message? Can you teleport without destroying the person? They you can keep a copy in stasis until an acknowledgment of safe arrival comes. 

From Xkcd Formula for the flow speed of a fluid Their portal is a closet but the same principal applies Q = A * sqrt(2 g d) = flow rate 

Previous answers deal with how to use the legal system to pierce the illusion or use forensics to prove it. This is how to cope with undetectable illusions without truth magic. If there is no way to prove that illusions were not used and no truth magic there is still an alternative, a total ban. Society could make it very illegal to use or know illusion magic with high penalties. With a good deal of effort its use could be rendered very rare and thus in most every case the illusion defense could be reliably discounted. The same also applies to mind control magic 

If possible, I want this armor to be effective against bullets, but much less against melee weapons and heavier projectiles like bolts, arrows or darts of any sort. My hypothesis would be that scientists have a created a non-newtonian fluid or jelly, that "hardens" very well at the energy spectrum of typical bullets. However, it does not "harden" enough for lower energies (melee weapons, arrows, bolts,...) or extremely high energies (railguns, coilguns,..). Keep in mind, this is the future (we are talking centuries ahead, possibly millennia). Therefore, these melee weapons can be far from primitive (rocket hammers, chainsaw blades,...) but we are focussing on mechanical melee weapons here. There are such weapons like light sabres (based either on plasma or laser technologies). I have created this separate question in response to this one because conversations tended to go towards the feasibility of the armor instead of towards the main subject. This question is NOT about the feasibility of using melee weapons over ranged, please refer to the linked question for that. 

-fight buy a private well armed military build a fortress and never leave it. Send assassins after what ever members of this team that you know of, to try to get them before they get you. This is unlikely to work 

So ... endless energy does not exist. If you draw energy from a planet's spin then you will slow it down. If a object spins in vacuum and nothing touches it yes it could spin forever but no energy can be extracted from that. Moving on lets hand wave how this energy is generated. Its on a moon now how do we get it onto a planet? The answer is lasers. You pick a spectrum of light that passes through air well and you build a laser in that spectrum and a receiving station on planet, that converts the light into what ever energy type you prefer. The simple version would be a large visible light laser and a receiving station that is a large set of solar cells. It has to be a laser (photons all moving in the same direction) to make sure that the light stays focused and hits the receiving station rather than spreading out and being lost to space. Visual light passes through earths atmosphere with little effect, and a well focused laser will keep the high energy confined to the receiving station. concerns
