Another trick for finding leaks that I don't see mentioned here is soapy water. Pull the tube out, and make a preparation of very soapy water. I particularly like dish detergent (e.g. dawn) because it is so concentrated, but any soap should work. When you brush soapy water over the tube, the air escaping from any leaks will form soap bubbles. If you don't have a great place to submerge it, this trick can be a lifesaver. When you're looking for a slow leak, you want to find the cause of the leak. To do this, it's important to mark the tire, the wheel, and the tube in some way so you can figure out exactly where the hole came from. You can use the valve stem on the tube and the rim to figure out where they fit together, but you should mark the tire to indicate where the tire sits in relation to the valve stem. If you do this, and keep them oriented the same (i.e. don't flip them over as you work on them), you should be able to find the leak and to find the place in the rim and the tire that's near the leak. Once you find the spot, inspect the rim and the tire. Any problems with the rim should be fairly obvious if you run your finger over them; check it and move on to the tire if you don't find anything. When you are inspecting the tire, start by running your finger over the offending surface. If you feel something sharp, be sure to dig it out. If that doesn't work (and with a really slow leak, it often won't), you'll need to get more aggressive. Turn the tire inside out, and fold it over in that area. The fold should stretch the inner rubber wall, and any holes caused by punctures will be more obvious. Find the hole, and then dig around in the hole with a small screwdriver or something. I've often found little shards of glass or bits of wire embedded in the tire itself. You can't feel it, you can't see it, but it can still puncture your tube when you go over a bump just wrong. 

When I was a student, I used to re-lace and true wheels using the bike upside-down as the truing stand. When touring, I carry a few spare spokes, and true by eye. It's better than riding a loaded bike on a twisted wheel. 

I have noticed that shouting (whatever words you use) is often taken personally by the drivers. It's probably the most effective and quickest to use in an emergency as described. I've seen several cyclists with a football whistle on a lanyard round the neck (mine is on my helmet strap) that can be held loosly between the teeth. 

If you have managed to remove the bars then reassemble outside the bike and insert stem and wedge loosely assembled. If you have not managed to remove the stem then you need to invert the bike and get the wedge arranged and then insert the bolt through the top (that is now on the bottom). Sometimes you can use a long bolt from underneath - remove front wheel and mudguard as Mo suggests - to engage the threads and hold the wedge in place while you put the retaining bolt down as normal. 

My girlfriend and I inflate the tires on our touring tandem to 90 psi. The bike carries both of us plus two fully loaded panniers in the back. At 90 psi in the tire with what probably ends up being over 350 lbs on the bike, we have never had a pinch flat. That said, I drive the bike very carefully to avoid hitting anything with a sharp edge (lots of driveways have a nasty edge on them). I wouldn't recommend over-inflating your tires (they're rated for a reason), but if you're getting a lot of pinch flats, you might consider riding a little more conservatively. A little caution can go a long way toward making things last. 

So there you go: there's no one answer. If there were, you wouldn't see so many products on the market. If you give it some thought, and do some experimentation with a couple of the products that suit your needs best, you should settle on something you can use well, and go through slowly. Chain lube doesn't need to be a big expense. 

A couple of years ago we had a new seat tube fitted to my wifes bike (a 20 year old Claud Butler Lady Dale) after it sheared where it joined the top tube - this was on a step through frame. Fortunately we live close enough to Roberts, one of the few frame builders in the UK, to be able to deliver it. I had to strip the frame for them and it cost about £150. They completely stripped the paint off the frame so we had it powder coated - approx £100. We did this as she really likes the bike and finds it comfortable for long rides. I don't think that we could get something similar for the price. If you want to get a new seat tube, you will probably have to send it away. None of the local bike shops would consider it - they make money selling new bikes after all. I think that only Mercian and Roberts offered a quote. Hopefully this has given you an idea of the costs and what is involved. If you like your bike as it is then it can be a viable option. I suspect that the longer seat post may be the cheaper alternative. 

On our tour, we met a great number of foreign tourists who had visited many countries by bicycle. Generally, their touring gear was not terribly different from what we ride with in the US. Sometimes it's worth going to a less efficient but more widely available component (like 26" wheels), but generally the most unique thing about a world touring bike is the rider. To make it a good touring bike all you have to do is ride it all over the planet. 

Waterproofness: If you ride your bike in the rain, you need a lube that will resist washing off. A lot of the inexpensive lubricants you can buy are not very waterproof, so by the end of your ride the whole thing has washed off. That's bad for your chain. If you look at the lubricants you're considering, the bottle should explicitly say if it's waterproof. For this condition, Phil's Tenacious Oils work pretty well, as does Boshield's T-9 lube. Wetness: Some lubricants leave the chain with a glistening wet surface. When you put it on, you should be able to wipe this off a lot, but some lubes (like oils, and some of the teflon-based lubes) will leave an oily sheen whenever they are present. This oily sheen can pick up dust from the environment. If you're riding in a dusty environment you want something that will dry completely and still work. For dry conditions, Tri-Flow makes a product that dries completely and leaves a teflon lubricating layer. Boshield's T-9 is good here too -- it dries and leaves a parafin wax lubricating layer. Application Instructions: Different lubricants require different rituals to apply them. Some of them suggest you put them on the chain, wait 30 min, and wipe off the extra. Others suggest you lube the chain and immediately wipe off the extra. Some even suggest putting it on the chain, wiping off the extra, and then letting the bike sit in a warm space for 12 hours before use. Depending on what you're doing, this may be impossible. My girlfriend and I accidentally bought a bottle of the "sit in a protected place for 12 hours" stuff on a bike tour, and it was terrible. We were camping, we had no protected place for it to sit. When you apply the stuff "wrong", it works very poorly; we were applying it every 2 hours of riding, and still getting some nasty wear and squeaking. 

If you are carrying much weight panniers are much easier. The bike balances better and they don't put strain on your back like a heavy rucksack does. I don't think that there is a proper rack that you can fit if you have rear suspension on your bike. I wouldn't trust the ones that just bolt round the seat tube with very much weight. 

When I made this change 15 years ago, as well as the new triple chain rings I needed to change the bottom bracket - cotterless square taper type - (which needed to be longer to correct the chain line), front derallieur (needs to be able to cope with extra travel and larger difference in chainring sizes) and rear derallieur (needs to be able to cope with larger total difference in teeth). You will also need to change your shifter to use the new range on the front. 

While we were cycling down the pacific coast of the US, my girlfriend and I met a swiss couple who had been touring the world for 15 months. They didn't move very fast, but they had covered thousands of miles. Here is what I remember from their setup: 

I've been in a number of situations where I was really glad to have a master link that I could pull apart. I'm a big fan of Sram's chains, and they're pretty reasonably priced here in the US. In your position, I'd try hard to find a chain with a master link. With that in mind, it's worth having (and even carrying with you) a spare master link. If you do blow apart your chain, being able to put it back together is well worth the extra few milligrams in your bike pack. Since they seem to come in 4-packs, it'd probably be fine to just find a chain and buy a pack of master links. 

I used Swalbe Marathon's last year without too many problems. As has been previously said, the narrow (25mm) tyres do help cut through snow, but when you are on ice nothing is very good. I liked Continental Top Tourers previously. 

I also use friction shifters, and recently put a 10 speed cassette onto my freehub - previously I had a seven. I put a 10 speed chain on as the chain walls are narrower. I have not yet changed the front chainrings, which are "eight speed". In your case put on a chain to match your cassette. Seven speed cassettes usually have a spacer on the wheel side when used on a larger freehub. It's always advisable to change the chain when you change the cassette anyway. 

In the UK, cycle paths aren't really set up for cyclists! They seem to be arranged by planners more interested in meeting targets for miles of cycleway. They are also aimed more at leisure cycling than for people who want to use their bike to go places. One of the problems that I find in the South East of England is that the cycle paths often take away the normal rights of way that apply to road users. In particular they share pavements so pedestrians are getting in the way and you have to give way when you cross side roads (as opposed to having right of way as a road user).
