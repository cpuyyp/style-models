I think your question hinges on intuitions about physical and conscious continuity as necessary prerequisite for personal identity. In Old Man's War consciousness is transferred to a new body by synchronising the new and the old brain. Imagine you are connected to a new body without any brain activity so far. At first you are only aware of your old body, then you are aware of both bodies and finally you are only aware of your new body (because your old one is euthanised). In this case the transition is experienced as continuous consciousness and you would be hard pressed to argue that "you" aren't "you". Another idea championed by Ray Kurzweil among others is that you replace small parts of your brain with chips (possibly to counteract age inflicted damage), then these new technological brain cells learn to interact with your biological brain and ultimately your whole brain is only hardware and software. Here you even have a physical continuous identity because the single changes are so small. Also there is no "old you" around. This kinds of technique could possibly assuage your misgivings about immortality. 

Mesothermics. Contrary to believe, cocroaches would not survive a nuclear winter, but not because of the radiation, but because of the cold. A global nuclear winter would see the appearance of endothermic characteristics in animal that use to be exothermic. Sadly this would mean that lizards and insects would be much more voracious. But the ability to lower the metabolism when there is little food or a creature finds itself in a warmer place could also be crucial. So many creatures could appear with the capacity to generate just enough internal heat to survive eficiently. 

Yes. Among humans there is some correlation between brain size and IQ: "Our results showed significant positive associations of brain volume and IQ (r = .24, R2 = .06) that generalize over age (children vs. adults), IQ domain (full-scale, performance, and verbal IQ), and sex." The standard deviation in brain size is on the order of 100cc and the average volume around 1400cc, as far as I know. So just tripling human brain size should lead to IQ-gains of 2*1400*0.06*15/100=25.2 points. Tripling the size in every dimension would be a 27-fold increase. Of course that correlation doesn't necessarily hold in a range far beyond the human range, so there might be diminishing returns. Now, as has been mentioned, correlation isn't causation. But in this case it probably is, because big brains come with two distinct disadvantages: You have trouble getting born and you have a very high energy consumption baseline. So, evolutionary big brains have to pay for their existence somehow, and the only likely way seems to be higher intelligence (of whatever form). And of course if brain size-iq is too "pseudo scientific" for you, the same argument works with height. The effect will be a lot weaker because height only increases in one dimension, but still 16 points, which makes sense in the context of a story. 

A parallel timeline is, in essence, a universe, so you have to destroy a whole universe by, for example, speeding up the big crunch or eliminating one of the four essential forces, like the Atomic Strong Force or the Gravity, in the whole universe. Don't ask me how. 

Your A-type star has a Dyson Swarm of unknown (or known) origin around it. Except the modules are not entirely opaque, but almost transparent, and of a nice shade of blue. 

An easy solution to your dilemma would be a one-way-road. A stretch of land that is only passable in one direction. A wide fast flowing river surrounded by impenetrable forest would be an obvious candidate for this scenario. In that case your travellers would travel in a circle and part of that circle would be the river: A very fast and convenient way to travel … but only in one direction. Travelling on this river could easily be more than ten times faster than hiking back trough the (dangerous) woods. So the kids would only have to stay hidden for a few days, which is probably more realistic than waiting for the seasons to change. 

A town or village may invest a lot of money in making a priest of high repute or known skill to come and bless a piece of land, to make it Hallow Ground, a place where necromancy doesn't work, and have sentinels patrol this cemetery the same as any other part of town. There would be also a lot of common knowledge mixed with myth about what makes a body easier for a necromancer to raise it and people would take that into account. Maybe they would bury them with stakes across their hearts, or extract the brain and organs like Egyptian mummies... 

There is one very realistic scenario: Embryo selection. In IV fertilisation usually around ten embryos are created, because a number of them is not going to be viable and the egg extraction is not a process you would want to undergo several times. If you had a way to choose the embryo with the highest cognitive potential, kids conceived that way would on average be noticeable smarter than random picks. So several things have to happen: 

I invite you to take a look at the bone structure of the hero shrew. This little creature can survive being stepped on by a grown man, but from the outside it looks like any other shrew. Similar modifications of the human backbone are probably necessary to live in high g environments for any extended period of time. Also, shrews are generally pretty awesome. I'm just saying echolocation, venom, eating scorpions, monster metabolism … well, maybe don't splice it all in. 

I think that there is a mistake in thinking that there are genetic or biological factors at all in force sensitiveness. First of all, the force is in all things, even Han Solo has shown remarkable speed and accuracy when shooting from the hip. Huts and Nomoidians are believe to be naturaly resistant to mental tricks, but this could be a product of their culture, which makes them wary of "things that look too god to be true" or "conveniently simple". SO it would be possible for any individual to achieve a level of understanding and limited use of the force simply by training. Skywalker's family is riddled with internal emotional conflict and external galaxy-shaping conflict. That could be very well why they are strong in the force and not their genes. I personally think that the force would regulate itself how many individuals achieve this kind of higher understanding of the force and when a sufficiently number is achieved there simply won't appear any more, no matter the trainings or breeding programmes. 

So if we ramp it up to 30 points aka 2 standard deviations per generation you'll get your 60 standard deviations in the next thousand years. Politically this has to be tied in with the elimination of genetic diseases and risk factors for diseases. It's not a designer baby, because you don't actually change anything. You just help your kid to be the most healthy, intelligent and happy kid you can have. Overall however, adoption will be driven by competition. The asian countries will start and the western countries will decide not to be left in the dust. Stephen Hsu blogs about this in great detail.
