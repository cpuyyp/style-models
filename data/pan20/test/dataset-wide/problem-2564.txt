Yes "dry insight". BUT it would just work if the kammic conditions (paramis) are there, at certain occation. So generally the message given in Dhammadhatus answer is right (in regard of layman-novice, a modern overestimation of those not really having taken refuge, served by monks living with improper livelihood, making wordily gain as well on the cost of the sublime gems) "One way is that in the world, and another the way beyound", to mix these two things up does neither support a good way in the world not keep the way beyond possible visible. It's good to practice firm generosity (Dana), virtue (Sila) and reflect and develope Vision (Bhavana) and having done ones duties well, seek for seclusion from time to time, rightouse earned and therefore possible benefical. What ever one traces on meditation centers and other lay mans or missguided monastics livelihood undertakings, this is not really destinated for any gain beyond, so it's better to take refuge and serve and follow those who are in front, doing ones own task and gain things in proper and rightous ways. Useful talks: 

Konrad and those interested, of course the path is not easy to do and it consists of letting go for long term benefit. The good in regard of this path is, that it actually benefits not only oneself but also all others, which therefore includes your bad "friends" as well. As even the Bodhisatta, having free one wish, wished: 

Once confession is made proper, one walk on clean and without need of remorse, sure kamma will have it's fruits anyway but no new is maintained on this matter. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gain by means of trade and exchange] 

For hurt in relation to relationships, I think reflecting about morality is helpful, specifically, how failure or mistreatment comes from a deficiency in morality. If we can reflect upon what is truly morally correct, we can start to see where we failed or where others failed. By knowing what is morally right, we can develop perspective on why the relationship did not work out & make us better prepared for the future. There are many suttas about relationship, such as AN 4.55, AN 4.53 & DN 13, etc. 

If the mind has reached final Nirvana, nothing in the whole world can bother it and make it suffer. The mind will completely cleansed of greed, lust, anger, hatred, irritation, delusion, attachment, fear, worry, hurt, sorrow, self-view, etc. 

Being happy seeing the sun shine across the buildings is a relatively harmless, simple & beautiful pleasure however, according to Buddhism, it remains a 'sensual pleasure' that the mind depends on or takes refuge in for happiness. Buddhism teaches about an even greater happiness or pleasure when the mind experiences the 'non-sensual pleasure' of meditation/concentration/jhana. Therefore, as Dhammapada 209 states: 

The Pali suttas unambiguously state the entire universe is void of self (SN 35.85). When the deluded idea of 'self' is born (SN 22.81) in the human mind, according to the Pali suttas, it is not a real 'self' but merely a 'view' (SN 5.10), merely a verbal convention (SN 1.25; MN 98), merely the arising of suffering (SN 5.10; SN 12.15), merely a disease (Ud 3.10) & a cancer (MN 140) or, in short, neurosis. 

As above. You need to start learning about the true Buddhist teachings and find some spiritual friends to help you learn. 

So what ever extend one is able to motivate ones parents in direction of virtue, generosity an discerment, one works not only for the repayment of ones debts but also gives condition for possible understanding the Dhamma when hearing. It's not sure that such giving back is possible, but it's for sure merely impossible is one does not show by deeds the attributes of virtue, generosity and discerment for oneself, not only strives for pleasure and enjoyments for oneself but also invites mother and father just in occations of such. As the Buddha pointed out, in this way one will not only never pay back but also not reallt help ones parents. One is clear, a virtues, generouse life of a child, his way and discerment, even if not direct explained, has impact on the parents and family, and when one starts not to simply waste away ones old merits, the possible luck like seen in the Mangala-Sutta, but also encourages ones parents not just waste them but doing merits, one does good. Even if coming from a western or christian cultur, such as doing merits was not alien, yet in one generation it seems to have become. Less are boundage of people who are enjoying, praising and sharing deeds of merits with each other and invite neigbors and others to join. So in this frame it might be useful to think and reflect how much benefical for oneselft and his/her beloved is actually, aside just talk and justifying, in daily life done? Conviction, the base of all, that deeds make a different, that deeds have an effect, and that good can be reached, is the base of all and it's by doing and displaying deeds that one gives chances for others to get interested and join ways, different form the usual living on "luck" (nissaya), not knowing from where it came. So what about the traditional way of teaching Dhamma, strating with teaching: 

Therefore, unsatisfactoriness & suffering are not the same thing because experiencing unsatisfactoriness results in not experiencing suffering. 

It is important to consider the monk or nun does not eat after noon (12pm) therefore what you offer them must sustain or nourish them for the rest of the day. Also, it depends on whether you visit them or they visit your home. I offer a full meal of the food I personally prepare for myself, which is brown rice, lots of vegetables & protein (fish, boiled egg, tofu or combination). Plus some fruit. If my home is visited (in passing), I spoon the food straight from my storage containers into their bowl (which, for me, is the cooking pots). The important thing is to not make a fuss about the offering because a monk or nun must be easy to look after. I spoon the rice into the bowl, until I am asked to stop. Then the curry, until asked to stop. Then offer some fruits, which I place on the top of bowel or offer on a tray, so the person can take it (without hand contact). If the ordained is of the opposite sex, you should avoid hand to hand contact but place things in & on the top of the bowl, on a tray or on a table. You can also ask if they need any body soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, washing detergent, insect repellent, sunscreen, band-aids or other small personal items for personal hygiene & health. You can offer tea or juice but generally they have water. Small long-life juice may be good they can keep for the afternoon (although some monks & nuns say fruit juice not allowed after 12pm). 

Just wonder if there are explicitly teachings on cause and effect of rejecting gifts. What might be the effect of rejecting a pure gift? Maybe one or another Sutta may come to your mind and maybe you like to share it in an answer. Gift here can be in the frame of material gifts, to time, effort, skill and knowledge. 

It has, like most ritual with material sacrifies, not really a connection to the Buddha-Dhamma, aside of the possible devotion and sacrify, metta and compassion, to ones ancestors, deities or spirits, which are possible wholesome deeds and generally praised by the Buddha (sacrifies for deities and ancestors) It's a very usual ritual, mostly performed by people with Chinese or Vietnamese ancestors all over SEAsia on Chinese fest days and has it's origin in certain Asian ancestor-cults and religions. Earlier real money was used which of course is mostly not legal, so copies and fake prints are usually used to be burned in front of the houses. As a one of a childs "duty" torward death relatives: 

Once possible firm in Dhamma, having become good independent, one may, if seeing benefit and having possibility, return to "bad friend" and maybe help them further. For now, like suggested in the airoplanes, adult should take on the emergency mask first.

It's good to reflect Dhamma while driving and be mindful. Let my person tell a merely personal story: Once my person was still a householder, a young successful employer, enjoyed to compfortable drive in the "bigges" car of his town, smooth, relacted, V8, no need to push the gas, just driving to the next meeting, 100 of thousand km a year, he got much aware of that * flap * * flap *, on the windows surface on a lonly road. Reflecting a little more of what is the case of such disaster, he reduced his drives an seeks for more. Later even took on the bike and focused on work not to far. After he actually left this all behind, he saw, that if he uses others for a ride, it is sometimes even more worse, so he thought, what if not greed, would one hinder just to simply walk. Even later, he observed the struggles people have with shoes and how less one in shoes, compfortable, "protective", takes care of his steps. Of course it gives certain freedom to look here and there, but what does one looking for, while under the shoes other are just smashed? At least, it carries a lot of freedom, if not depending on "protection" and "compfort" and not only that one mostly is much more flexible, much more able to move and even faster as an aeroplain in calculating right, one able to train mindfulness by each and every step, has, if not more, the gain of freedom of remorse made his possession, a liberty not easy to gain, but just step by step. Of course the "story" is much deeper, but maybe this short cut gives good reason for possible less build on "equanimity" but take on the road of letting go, reduce and sacrifies, step by step. Maybe some inspirations are also found in some words my person wrote some times ago: Who is the winner in the Traffic of life?. As for the question again: being mindful on the frames of references, even while driving, is not dangerous but actually good. If it how ever, does not lead to certain insight about the drive behind the drive, does not really lead to disenchantment in regard of having a nice drive, certainly the task might be not right made and can, in this case, be of course dangerous in all aspects. A nice first step into Dhamma might be also "Step by Step, by late Ven. Ghosananda. 

Buddha taught all worldly things are ephemeral but did not teach everything is "grief". "Grief" is an emotion created by the mind rather than a characteristic of things. The seeker keeps reflecting & examining how all worldly things are ephemeral until the mind realises completely that ephemeral things cannot be any other way or 'suchness' ('tathātā'). This will result in the mind giving up desires & expectations towards ephemeral things. This is described at the end of the Anatta-Lakkhana Sutta, as follows: 

'Paṭi­nissag­gā', which means means 'relinquishment' or 'giving back', possibly 'returning back', and is generally found in the fruition of the path, such as in 3rd noble truth (below), last (16th) stage of Anapanasati or in definitions of Nibbana (below). 

In the Rahula Samyutta, the word 'Dhamma' refers the teachings of 'ultimate or higher truth' (lokuttara dhamma), which lead to developing the Noble Eightfold Path & enlightenment. As stated: 

When the defilements are calmed, the mind feels joy due to the cleansing of the defilements. This joy are more refined & subtle than rapture & happiness because the mind is now much more pure. 

For example, a fire burns conditioned by wood. The same fire is extinguished, by using water. Using water to extinguish the fire is conditoned. But what remains, namely, the absence of fire, is not conditioned by the water because it is not dependent upon the water. When the fire is extinguished, the subsequent evaporation or absence of the water is not the condition for the absence of fire. The fire had a cause (e.g. lightning striking a tree); the extinguishing of the fire had a cause (e.g. hosing with water) but the staying out of the fire is not conditioned by the water. It is the absence of fire that is Nibbana. The path removes what is hidden. But the path does not create or cause what is hidden. Similarly, cutting down a tree is dependent upon (conditioned by) an axe. But once tree is cut down, what remains is not dependent upon the axe. Thus what remains is 'unconditioned' since what remains has always been there but the tree covered what was always already there. 

So don't be touched on common ground when "I have seen on internet" might call into quest. It' not yours. 

My person was not so avaliable here, those days. Here maybe some helpful links and inspirations, Mr/Mrs Uhoh. The great buddhist ancestor festival - share ways of your country, tradition It, if researching, has next to in every country it's long time till current tradition and is not that much connected with religions direct in it's performences. Such as a hell-door story, king and monks, is also base of the culture here in the country of the Khmers. 

Simply focus on what is skilfully and unskilfully, making clear that one not acting skilful by himself can not be easy a place to relay on, find out by yourself what leads to longterm happiness while searching for approve from the wise and then, end your teaching, after indroducing to the Brahma-Viharas, like him: 

All of the possibility to gain such a teacher is by the seeker at least, or let my person say be being touched, good or bad, comes it's way. How it happens, that a person gain Dhamma, enters the stream, is sure best explained by the Buddha himself as reported: 

Neither such as Buddhism nor such as Hinduism do approach anything or have views, people have, and they have as much different views as there are people, of corse. Maybe this short quote helps in general to do not lose what is called proper attention: 

It's good to practice in areas where such can be susbected, and its most importand to do such on places where people have joy in giving and sharing merits, rather to see good deeds and joy with it as a tabu and childish. Something that is of course not easy not find in modern sociaties. It's all, incl. the skill of giving, a matter of right view, and associating inwardly and outwardly with it. A matter that is how ever not spoken of, is also how monks, in this case, are paying gratitude to given special food and it should be a warn sign, if people approach with "all is anicca"
