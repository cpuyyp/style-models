Physics: Assuming a species whose bodies consist to a significant part of water, we set their specific heat capacity to 

If you really want to be on the safe side, and places like the poles, deep forests and caves are ruled out, then I'd say that it's impossible. Because if we assume that you can neither know nor control the weather, then if that traveler is paying close attention to its surroundings then the ISS or one of the many visible satellites will give it away pretty soon. Coming from a place and time roughly like our 14th century, that traveler (being a traveler... and probably with some naval experiences) will surely know that it's possible to use stars to determine one's location. Moving stars is surely nothing that's easily done with magic. 

I'd say no, it's not possible according to our understanding of physics. From "moves through different galaxies", I assume you mean that the star moves at relativistic speed, so that it will see more than one or two galaxies before the heat death of the universe. I also will assume the planet somehow ended up in an orbit around this star intact. Together, they will be crashing through any matter in their way. The neutron star is so tiny and dense that it could likely fly straight through a planet without slowing down. Interstellar gas clouds and gravitational influence from nearby stars and planets are barely noticed at all. The planet, having a tiny density compared to its star, will be bombarded with all those particles and slow down, destabilizing its orbit until it either spirals into the neutron star or flies off into deep space. 

You could ask a similar question historically about the world's most powerful tool, money. Why did bankers finance kings instead of running the kingdom themselves? Because bankers don't want problems, they just want a profit. It's not hard to say a similar thing about merchants/traders. Now, as to why a king or other person who is motivated by fame/dominion selling it... there's a value to everything, and if these artifacts are so common, then they can probably buy a new one later. This works out especially well if the quest/task they're assigning isn't something money can buy. 

'Mountains' effect on climate is that they block moisture from passing over them (or severely limit it.) You can see this quite clearly in the USA as shown here: : Everything that has a mountain between it and the ocean is super dry and the area right in front of the mountain is super wet. That's what mountains do to climate. However, your island/continent is not like Washington. You have ocean on four sides like this: 

Cold blooded animals have several sets of enzymes that maintain bodily functions at different temperatures, while warm-blooded only need and have one set. This would be the first big barrier to evolving (back) to being cold blooded. Not having a high enough metabolism to sustain the brain at our intelligence levels would be the second barrier. I don't think there are any circumstances that could force modern humans to evolve to being cold blooded. We're simply too good at changing our environment to suit our needs. With stone age or earlier humans, you might still have strong enough environmental pressure to direct evolution. Some mammals hibernate during winter, greatly lowering their metabolism and conserving energy in times of food shortages. That is probably the best route towards evolving cold-bloodedness. Humans might still have some of those genes and they could lead to a lethargic state of semi-hibernation, which over a million years or so could be refined into a mostly functional state regardless of body temperature. The catch is that energy efficiency implies lower brain functions, making these humans dumber again. Btw, cold-blooded animals also die at 40 C or higher (vital proteins start breaking down at 42-44 C for everyone) and freeze at 0 C (or a little below for marine animals with anti-freeze, as commented), so they have a narrower temperature range than warm blooded animals. 

Perhaps because they can molt? If this long-lived species molts every ~5 years, then it would be a perfect way of removing anything but extreme scarring. Perhaps severe cases might require multiple molts. The molting could even be a factor in their longevity. Also, they can regrow limbs while in the molting stage. Cover up the scars by giving them exotic joint structures that mask the appearance of the scarring there. So, a limbless member of this species would just deal with it for a few years and then, right before their next molt, rip off the remainder of the limb they wanted to regenerate. Wait a few weeks and voila! Shiny new arm! If all members of the species only had visible scarring if it had occurred within the last 5 to 10 years, then there really wouldn't be much scarring to see. I can't speak too much for psychological traumas, but I see two key possibilities for dealing with those. 

The more interaction between groups, the more the local rules will converge, until a fairly stable society could arise. However, relations between groups will still be all-important and any traveler needs to have a host when far away from his group or risk being murdered when nobody of his own group can witness and accuse the offender. This limits the size and cohesiveness of any society without institutional law enforcement. 

This kind of story should frame all your major acquisitions into a narrative that makes sense to people and doesn't invite undue scrutiny. The minor excursions from your field of business can be adequately covered by business practices that have well-known precedents. Google with its many employee-driven side projects is a great example. Amazon can't stop itself from trying a new line of business the moment it threatens to become profitable. Need an excuse for a dozen lawyers? Get yourself into a patent lawsuit. Edit: as mentioned in other answers, diversifying is a valid business strategy in itself, but only if there's a profit to be had (or positive PR), limiting its applications. Finally, some things you don't need to do yourself. Extend your network and support friends and business partners in their ventures. Learn to play Golf, put money in some investment funds and then invite both the investor and one of your intended recipients to a game or two. They'll get the hint and money will end up where you want it, with you having any hand in it officially. 

Easily accessible by both superpowers You've already answered your question. If both superpowers can easily access the island, then either superpower can easily destroy any installation that the other creates. Therefore, assuming that neither side is ruled by complete idiots, nobody is going to waste the resources to try and build anything on this island, since it'll just get blown up or blockaded or otherwise rendered useless. Now, this alone doesn't 100% explain why they wouldn't both at least claim the island. Belligerent states do tend to lay claim to everything. So, we have to take into consideration reputation and assume that neither side currently claims it. Given these two things, if either side decided to lay claim to the island, then the other superpower could prevent the construction of any installations and then just waltz in for a photo shoot every month or so. "Ooooh, look at the mighty superpower. Can't even defend one lousy island from our 'elite' photographers, ooooh." It works better if you use really wimpy-looking photographers and include their picture in the press release. It's just too easy for one superpower to punish any move by the other on this island. The main character isn't affected by this, since (I assume) he/she/it is not at war with either superpower. As to why the superpowers ignore him/her/it, do elephants go out of their way to squash caterpillars? 

Technology seems the likely answer to magic in this case. Cryptography in particular could be used to "sign" votes on ballots in a way that would reveal any tampering, assuming that magic doesn't allow the mages to "just know" the correct cypher for a changed or extra vote. The distribution of keys for voting machines would have to be guarded extremely carefully, with magic detection being used as much as is feasible. Voting machines should have magic-sensitive anti-tampering features too, that clearly invalidate the results. Lacking technology of this level, you would need organization and people to detect the tampering. The only way I could see that happen is to flood the election with honeypots of all kinds, to entrap the mages: 

Your skin will pretty much start disintegrating You'd have to make every tool that the crew used water-tight or non-electrical, and wiring failures could be catastrophic. 

Well, there's a loophole if I ever saw one. In fact, in a magical universe, this should be downright easy to work around. We just have to use magic to alter him or his surroundings so that he will be helpless to save himself regardless of how much time he has. 

So you have several options. A lot depends here - where are the ocean currents and prevailing winds coming from? 

Well, the easiest way would be to convince/force him to kill himself, since the time warp won't stop him. Therefore, poison him with something that will make him suicidal within a day or two. 

Religion! The point of divergence would be right in the (alternate) bible: Jesus goes to John the Baptist, but there is no baptism because the river has been fouled by some heathens upstream. Instead, Jesus holds a sermon about river water being the gift of life and purity from God. After that, the expanding Christian culture makes sure to always protect their rivers right up to the springs, leading to your country borders. Terrorism Alternatively, someone came up with the idea of poisoning whole rivers as a form of chemical or biological warfare. Given the state of science back then, it would probably have been an accidental discovery. For example, an earthquake exposes some kind of weird-colored soil and every fish in the stream it fell into died for many days travel downstream. A devious general/rebel/villain then carts off barrels of the goo and dumps it in the springs of his rival kingdom's main river. After that, all water sources will be of military importance and no country will leave another in control of their water sources.
