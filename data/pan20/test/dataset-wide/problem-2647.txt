"One must imagine Sisyphus happy". Yep ... because imagining the likely reality would be too painful. I think Camus is using 'severity by opposites'. (I am quoting myself as I don't know the proper term for this.) This means there's no words that carry the weight needed so instead you use words from the opposite end of the meaning spectrum. For example if our waiter asks if we enjoyed our meal, given that the plates are clean, we could say 'inedible ... hated it ... We want our money back and we didn't even pay yet.' The absurdity gives weight to the depiction. Alternatively, nope. Sisyphus has free will and that means one can choose (to pursue) to be happy regardless of the situation. Camus is saying that, conventionally, it's not possible for reality to give us the external circumstances for instant gratification. Every single conscious person, through free-will, can choose to pursue desensitizing themselves to an otherwise unpleasant reality, and possibly, ultimately, learn to love, be happy with, something you previously hated. I will offer the very very dissimilar in scale example of me and broccoli. I hated it until age 30. I forced myself to eat it ... masking it with spices or such, and now it's my favorite veggie, and I also prefer veggies as my main food group (previously being 'junk food'). 

As phrased I think the question isn't properly representing the issue. To me the question is "What is my moral obligation to be altruistic." because your sole example is a shared cause, not a personal one. Are you morally obligated to campaign for a cause you believe in? ... absolutely, 100%, if it's a personal one. Isn't personal health, both mental and physical, a cause you believe in? Making a living? Using the recycling bins. Paying taxes despite the dental bills from gritting teeth? How about happiness? If you have a cause to 'keep the world safe (so I can be happier)' then isn't practicing the skill of being happier (mental health) a cause you should champion? (If you think happiness is not a moral obligation then why would any participation in society be one ... putting out the trash, regulating one's emotions, etc. People who practice the skill of happiness don't usually commit crimes, hurt others, etc. Why is happiness not a moral cause we all share?) I think because you do not exist as a Borg you have no moral obligation to be altruistic. You DO have a moral obligation to maintain personal integrity. Very practically speaking this usually means spending whatever altristic time you choose on local causes. Most people are most often more effective making small changes on a small scale. For example a person who refuses to have children (despite wanting them) because the child will increase the carbon footprint of the world is not thinking in a healthy way. 

I don't think that the fourth dimension would be time, if it were discovered. Time is a measure of physical change that presumably should exist in and separately from all conceivable (and otherwise) dimensions of space. Time is itself only a measure of change in the physical world. The fourth dimension, instead, is a dimension of space that we humans cannot possibly imagine, because we have no way of observing it. It's akin to a 2D shape living on a 2D plane and trying to imagine the 3rd dimension. He understands length and height, but width would be impossible to imagine if he tried. He wouldn't even know TO try because he doesn't understand its existence. It's a direction that he can't move in. It should be noted that this being would surely experience time, because time is a measure of change, even in this strange two-dimensional reality. This is very much like our situation. We live in the third dimension, in a three-dimensional universe. We can move in three different directions. Up, down, and side to side. The fourth dimension is an unimaginable (but completely reasonable to a fourth dimensional observer) direction to move in. We can't imagine it, just like a 2 dimensional being couldn't imagine moving into the third dimension, but it would seem so simple to us three-dimensional people. Presuming that the fourth dimension is time is ridiculous in the following way. Imagine that the two dimensional being mentioned before, and I see no reason why they wouldn't experience time, had a breakthrough. He thinks he's discovered the what the third dimension is! It's obviously time, because that's multiple 2 dimensional spaces, right? Well, we as third dimensional beings know that that's wrong. The fatal flaw in his theory is that there is in fact a different direction that he doesn't know about. So why would the fourth dimension not follow this pattern? It makes more sense to think of the fourth dimension as a mysterious, unimaginable new direction or dimension of space. 

Would there be two of me, or none of 'new' individuals could be considered as me? Who would have right to my belongings (job,...) and the right to be me, none or both? How things would change if we would implant both parts of brain into different bodies? 

When you would read this book for the first time it would be able to predict your thoughts exactly. Then as you would go amazed with it trying to figure out where the catch is - you would do the guessing game, by thinking of the sentence in your mind then reading same exact sentence by opening the page you haven't read before... and book would not miss once.... At this point you should conclude that ether you are high on psychedelics, or suffering from acute schizophrenia.... Book cannot prove God... EDIT: The point I am trying to make is since you cannot trust your senses (Descartes) no external source (including books) will be reliable to prove/disprove God... 

One of such could be British cult of Queen, on the other hand it could be considered part of British brand along with Union Jack, red buses and postal poles. I think every nation's 'heroes' will be portrayed in too much light and all the traitors and tyrants vilified, which makes it so much harder to draw the line where 'history' ends and 'civic religion' starts. 

I am having some doubts in understanding universalisation of maxims in Kants Categorical Imperative. 

How would I apply in cases like: Should I eat meat, or should I drive under speed limit? How does one universalize a maxim? 

Are people truly agents of their own individual destiny? Or was everything a person did yesterday, an hour ago, or two seconds ago destined to happen from the beginning of time? People are constantly making cognitive choices. From the shirt a person wears, to the comment he or she made in class last Wednesday. In the present moment, which is an almost immeasurably small instant of time, a person doesn't really know for sure what is going to happen in his or her future. What choices will he or she make? What will happen next week, tomorrow, or five seconds from now? It's difficult to predict perfectly, though there are no rules against planning your actions ahead of time. Everything a person chooses to do and everything they think is for a reason. There is always a causation for anything that happens. For example, a person might raise his or her hand in class BECAUSE he or she knows the answer, and he or she KNOWS the answer because he or she learned it in the past. He or she learned it the past for whatever reason, but it was learned. My point is that there is no spontaneity to life. Every action and thought is caused by something else. The process preceding and leading up to an action can be infinitely complex, always stemming from the very first thing that ever happened. Once an action or thought has taken place, it has happened. There is no going back. The past is the past, and it cannot be changed because there is no such thing as time travel. But what if there was? Imagine a reality in which a person's consciousness could travel back in time. He or she could see and hear everything going on around him or her, but would be unable to interact with anything and would be I nvisible and inaudible. To add another layer to this hypothetical, let's say that a person can hear people's thoughts while in this state. A person would be able not only to watch what happened in the past, but to know what people are thinking as their actions are taking place. Would not everything transpire in the exact same way that it did before? What could possibly change that would cause people to think different thoughts and therefore choose different actions? Nothing. Every sentient being is a product of his or her experiences, molded by what happens to her or him, what he or she learns and experiences. A person has inherent qualities, but even those are out of his or her control. It's just the way it is. Theses qualities, be they inherent or products of experience, all work together to form a person. This person will react to things that happen to her or him BASED on these qualities. The events that happen to a person during her or his life that cause them to learn, experience and REACT are out of her or his individual control. For what reason would the things that happen around you change if you were to go back in time? The answer is that they can't. Since everything happens for a reason (and I'm not talking about a higher power controlling what happens, I'm talking about cause and effect), nothing can happen differently than it already did. This eliminates such ideas as "I could have performed better" or "you could have told me the truth." Everything anyone does and every thought that pops into her or his mind is a result of other things, and since those other things can't change, a person will always react the exact same way if put into the exact same scenario (including the memories that they have in their mind). I'm not saying that people can't learn from mistakes. I'm saying that (if a person were able to go back in time, forget that he or she was from the future, and be placed in the exact same position that he or she was in in the past) everything would transpire in the exact way that it did before. Every rain drop would fall the same way, every leaf would blow the same way, and every person would act the same way. One last example is that of a hypothetical "copy universe." Imagine that there are two identical universes, Universe 1 and Universe 2, where everything is happening exactly the same way at exactly the same time. Every rain drop is the same, every speck of dust floating in the air is the same, and every person's actions are the same. Neither universe is aware of the other's existence. Universe 1's time suddenly stops, but Universe 2 continues on, none the wiser. It remains this way for 10 years. Would not the events of Universe 1, once un-paused, match identically the events of Universe 2, which would now be ahead ten years? All logic would suggest that it would indeed run exactly the same way that Universe 2 did during the last 10 years. Since neither universe's knowledge of the other's existence is in any way pertinent, should not this principle apply to our universe? Everything that will happen in say the next 10 years will play out exactly like it is supposed to. None of this means that we are incapable of making our own decisions. I'm not saying that anyone is JUSTIFIED in making poor decisions because he or she was fated to. If a person knows right from wrong and chooses wrong, it is their fault, but the truth is that from the moment they were born, they were always going to make that wrong decision. It's still wrong, but they were destined to be wrong. This is because there are reasons behind his or her action that cannot change. It may be difficult to reconcile between the concepts of fate and free will, but I believe that what I have laid out is logical, however extraneous to most people's lives. Since no one truly knows exactly what they will do, everything they do feels very much like free will and therefore, in a sense, is. A person knowing that he or she was always going to do everything that he or she has already done is not important to learning and growing as a person, regardless of whether or not it is true. 

Are there any other things we can be certain of? Are there any 'hooks' that can be hooked into 'I think therefore I am', that one could be 100% certain are truthful as 'I think therefore I am' itself? 

This question is coming out from our conversation with @Conifold: He believes that for creation of another omnipotent being 'strong' omnipotence is required. 

Considering that I can survive with only half of my brain, and I am a mind living in a body. If we would split my brain in two and then implant one part into some other body and leave other half in my head: 

I would argue against that fear of failure is as good of a motivator as confidence in oneself's success and domination. Let's consider following situation: Game is won by best of 5 Player1 has 2 victories. Player2 has 0 and 2 losses. Player2 is driven by fear of loss as he is only one game away from defeat. Player1 is driven by confidence as he need to fail all 3 games in a row to loose. In given scenario Player1 will benefit more from employing risky strategy because if he losses it's not tragic - he has 2 more games. Player2 on the other hand does not have this luxury and will try to play most standard game because of his fear of loss and therefore is more likely to loose to 'all in' strategy. 

Basically idea is that if you will convince yourself that you will get cancer you will get it, and if you will convince yourself that you have pockets full of cash then they will become full. EDIT: One shouldn't be able to attract something that he is not aware of in a frame that things only happen when one convinces himself of them being true. Is there possible logical explanation for person 'attracting' cancer (in 'law of attraction' frame) if he does not know what cancer is?
