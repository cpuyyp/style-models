Context switch are normal. A process is assigned to an quanta of time, if it finish (or it paused caused by the need of ressources) what it have to do it can let the processor go. That said to count how many context switch are done (it becomes a stackoverflow.com answers) it would take the internal kernel schedule() command to write into the processes tables. A there is no such thing if you program your own kernel you'll be able to see but it's quite difficult. 

Yes it's possible to do so put a htaccess in the file you want to moderate the access. Put the same text as in the configuration file. Make sure that your conf files will read .htaccess. 

It's not not secure from people sniffing the network. Just think about it when user need to connect there javascript hashes their password and send them to the server. The server compares it to the database. A sniffer would only have to sniff the password and send it to the server so this is as secure as clear text password. As others said I recommend SSL/TLS tunnels to be establish to connect to your server. 

EveryDNS used to have this, but I switched to DynDNS because I found out my router has support for DynDNS. 

Just FYI, the case sensitivity is dependent on the collation. There are case-insensitive colations you could use as a workaround, perhaps temporarily. 

We are doing nightly full backups and noon differential backups. We use Full recovery model with SQL Server 2005, but logs are never backed up and are truncated(TRUNCATE_ONLY) after the full backup. Restoring to a point in time is not a requirement, restoring to one of the nightly or noon backups is sufficient (Not my decision). So the question at hand is, since they are throwing away the logs every night, is there any reason to not use Simple Recovery model? Is there any benefit to using Full Recovery model if we are throwing out the logs every night? Thanks. 

I have seen people recommend RAID 10 over RAID 5 for databases due to RAID 10 giving better performance and a better chance of recovering from a hardware failure. This confuses me as I thought the purpose of using RAID 5 was more a matter of the parity allowing the detecting and correcting write errors to ensure the integrity of the data. My understanding was that RAID 10 can not recover from write errors. I.e. if a bit has an error, it will be the opposite of the bit in the mirrored drive, and thus it will be impossible to tell which bit is the one with the error, and which is the correct one. However, I tried googling along the lines of detect "write error" with raid 5 vs raid 10 to see if anyone covered this point, and came up empty handed. Am I making this all up in my head? Can a RAID 5 array detect and recover from write errors using the 3 parity bit? Or does the detection not occur until much later when the data is read and the parity indicates an error? If a RAID 10 array has a write error, will it be able to determine which of the mirrored bits is the one in error? I.e. the drive indicates a read failure for that particulor bit, or does it just see the bits do not match and since there is no parity it can't determine which is in error? I see some discussion of rebuilds being triggered by a read error. Do write errors not get detected until later when the data is being read? In other words, does the writer error occur, but the erroneous data just sits there until possibly much later when the data is read and the parity indicates an error. Is that why you are at risk of getting additional read errors during rebuild, in that you could be writing a large amount of data with errors but the errors will not be detected until the next time the data is read? I would like to clarify that tape backups do not address the above question. If you have a scenario where data integrity is very important, and you can't detect write errors, then all the tape backups in the world won't help you if the data you are backing up already has errors. 

It seems that the return path for the packets is not known. To be sure you would need to check intermediate routes, I'll get to that in the end. When you ping 10.10.3.50 from the 10.10.2.0/24 host it is forwarded your default gateway (lets assume 10.10.2.1), then itself checks its own routing table and sees the route for 10.10.3.0/24 via 10.10.1.5. A ICMP redirect can normally be ignored since its purpose is only to shorten hops needed and router load. But it is sent because its seems that the next hop is on the same physical net as the request cames from. But what you should check is wheter or not the 10.10.3.0/24 router as a route for the source subnet 10.10.2.0/24. 

In grub legacy it uses exclusively menu.lst. In grub2 grub.cfg which you should never modify by your self. If I recall correctly there are commands called grub2-install and update-grub2 on debian that will configure grub.cfg. 

auditd is a good utility to know what have been done to every file. It might not be what you need tough. 

Where can the pfsense log files be located and viewed? I have searched the documentation and it doesn't indicate the log files location for the various components of pfsense. 

I am running pfsense 2.0.3 nanobsd 4g i386 on virtualbox. VM configured with 4gb ram, there's 8 gb total on host system, with two net interfaces configured as host only. This will go on an SSD mini atx box, but for now I am just running on VM for learning pfsense. I assigned interfaces, em0 to WAN, and em1 to LAN. From the windows host(hosting the VM) I brought up the browser and tried to connect to the LAN IP. I was intermettently getting timeouts and I would reboot the server or use the reboot web configurator option, and sometimes I could get the login screen but after logging in with default user/pass, I'd get a blank page. Absolutely no error messages or feedback of any kind. I typed password carefully, thinking maybe it was doing anonymous authentication, since according to their documentation provides a blank page by-design. After many tries and reboots I finally got the wizard screen. I completed the wizard and the final page indicated it was going to redirect after a few moments, after a few minutes it redirected but failed to retrieve the next page. From there the web configurator again was not responsive, timing out. I rebooted and still same thing. How do you troubleshoot something that gives you absolutely no feedback or error messages? Any ideas about what might be wrong would be welcome, but primarily: How do I troubleshoot failures in the web configurator? Is there logs specific to the web configurator, or do I need to poke around in the web server logs, pfsense logs, etc.? Is there any documentation on directory structure that would help me find these? I've found from distribution to distribution, that each has it's own idea of where user programs, logs, etc are stored. 

It seems to be an client problem why it's declining the address. Is it well configured to use a DHCP address. Try runing dhclient manually. 

You can install a RAID volume utility that will do the mirroring during runtime, but to get there you'll need to copy the entire disk (not only files but the whole disk in raw like with dd command in unix). 

If I understood well you want to delegate the DNS from your registar to your own DNS server. So yes it is possible you just have to tell your registar to point to it. You will need to add an NS record and a A record to point to your server and server's IP address And so you'll will be the authoritative DNS server for your zone. It should look like this: registar: example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com. ns1.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; ip of ns server is needed because it's the only way for everbody ns2.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; to know where you are You: example.com. IN SOA ( ;;; soa blargh!! As it means Start Of Authority you are the one ) example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com. a.ramdom.host.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; ip of a random host 

If I have a mirrored pair of 250GB drives in a pool, and I later buy two more drives and add another mirrored pair to the same pool, can that second mirrored pair be 500gb? Such that my total usable space would be 750GB? Or do all the mirrored pairs in a pool need to be the same size? 

Intel AMT is a motherboard feature found in certain chipsets such as Q67. So if you are looking for a superMicro board with this, then just find out which intel chipsets support Intel AMT, and then look for supermicro boards with that intel chipset. There are some various other requirements as far as what CPU you use, etc. In a nutshell the motherboard keeps one of the ram chips powered, the northbridge powered(which runs the management interface), the onboard ethernet connection, and an extra flash chip to store settings. So you can connect to the system over ethernet and access the remote managmeent features/power-on/power-off etc. I am not sure though if this is available in any chipsets targeting servers though, but it is really powerful and would seem to be well suited for servers. 

For some reason those cmdlet are availible using the 64 bit version of powershell. It is shown as Windows PowerShell in the menu, without the trailling (x86). If it is not shown in the applications menu just search for it. You should then have access to the cmdlet for deduplication. 

I accidently create a "\" file into my linux how to revert it. I tried rm \ (as it's the escaping character it didn't work), rm '\' and rm \\ nothing worked. 

Normally it will be an unsigned 32 bit (on 32-bit system) so 2^32 = 4294967296. So the range is 0-4294967295. 

What you'll have to do is use UUID of your partition instead of partition special file. If your unbuntu is recent it will use UUID by default in GRUB and /etc/fstab. 

So I would check if your receiving end has any delay to fetch mail or that the server that receives the mail did not put in a long anti-spam check. I would pull out the logs from your mail server at that moment to see what happened wrong. If the header is right you should look at 2015-09-08 03:19 -0600 (your servers local time). 

Scenario: Excel file, with a SSAS data source connection Pivot Table/Charts with filters and slicers Published to Sharepoint 2010, such that users can access the report as a Excel Web Access Web Part, such that they can't break/change the pivot table other than changing filters and slicers. Note that I am NOT talking about powerpivot. Rather just using a regular data source connection. As users access the report, I would like the most current data(within the last day) from SSAS to be reflected in the report. Assume that the SSAS database is refreshed daily already. 1) Does Excel Services and/or the webpart automatically refresh the data when the report is opened/viewed through the Web Access Web Part? And/or can it be configured to periodically refresh the data? 2) What are the server software requirements to support this? Does it require SQL Server Enterprise edition? Or is standard enough? Does it require Sharepoint 2010 Enterprise, or is standard enough? when I say "support this" I mean both the Excel Web Access Web Part as well as the refreshing of the data from SSAS into Excel. 3) Does the Web Part allow them to only interact with filters/slicers? Or will they be able to mess with/break the pivot table? If so, will changes/breakage they make only be persisted for their session and not effect future sessions or other users? I would test this myself but I have had difficulty getting the trial of Sharepoint setup on my home computer(ultimately I won't even be the person setting it up in production anyways) and I just want to know what edition will support these features. Thanks. 

What I find strange is it that client's routing tables are pointing to nowhere (0.0.0.0). It is ok for local networks but for 10.2.10.1 that passes trough a tunnel it might be a problem. 

Try to see documentation about iptables there should be some config about caping bandwith. But on the other end you should try to configure iptables to ban bad IPs so it will clear the problem and also you will be able to report IPs and time of the attack to authorities. 

I am using Windows Server 2012 R2, and after it reboots I absolutely need to connect to it in local or else it will not allow any connections (RDP, shared folders). What is the option (local or group policy) to allow connection without needing one to connect to it in person. 

As they are block these connections are not harmful for a DDOS. Logs are only there to let you know who tried to attack you. What is harmful is when the number of half connection opened gets near the limit you specified in your config. What I suggest you is to follow the advice of Zypher and have your firewall to moderate these connections. 

I installed SQL Server 2008 and typed in an instance name of but it seems to have been isntalled as a default isntance. Trying to connect using fails but using just the computer name succeeds. The service is listed with as if it is the default instance, but the data directories all have the .sql2008 instance name suffix. So not only is it not what I wanted, but the data directories and service names have inconsistent suffixes. Was there something else I needed to do besides specifying an instance name during installation? Maybe a checkbox I missed? Is there a way to change from a default instance to a named instance? 

Scoped to a specific filesystem name :No header so that first line is a snapshot name : List snapshots (list can list other things like pools and volumes) : Display the snapshot name property. : Capital denotes descending sort, based on creation time. This puts most recent snapshot as the first line. : Says include children, which seems confusing but its because as far as this command is concerned, snapshots of TestOne are children. This will NOT list snapshots of volumes within TestOne such as . : Pipe to head and only return first line. 

I am trying to follow this procedure to add a registry key to all my domains computer. The thing is that I don't see anything under: 

I want to place a VPN beetween home and school because I do not trust the network down there. If I configure the VPN server with NAT-T (nat-traversal) and configure my router to foward UDP 20 -> UDP 500 && UDP 21 -> 4500 (I also configure the client to use UDP 20 for IKE and 21 for NAT-t) will the configuration works? And is IKE mandatory in order to ipsec to function? 

If you run bash yo can edit /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc. They are analog to the user ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc. So put all your common vars in /etc and user more specifc in ~/. 

The fact is when you copy back a backup of the partition it keep (as you notice) the size it was because the filesystem has some field for that. What I suggest you is not to copy the entire partition, but reformat in ext3 your partiton of 98G and copy the files into that new partion. To avoid some permission problem use the command cp -pr (p flag for permission keep and r for recursive)
