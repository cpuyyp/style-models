Look up Alex Viada's work, he is a world class strength and endurance athlete. He has a great book on hybrid training, but even if you don't want to buy a book he has two blog articles called "so you want to run and be strong" (part 1 and part 2) as well as many other interesting blog posts on his website, completehumanperformance.com. 

Any exercise can be done in an aerobic manner if you want it to, you just need to change its training modality and go for very low resistance and very high duration. I wouldn't recommend free weight exercises as you are going to reach a fatigued state pretty quickly and dropping a barbell on your face is a real risk, but most machines could be used pretty safely assuming your body proportions fall within a reasonable range of what the machine is built for. It won't make you strong (aerobic training doesn't build strength, almost by definition), but it will increase your endurance. Examples: 

It could just be a short barbell. They're usually used for exercises like straight bar curls which require a barbell but not necessarily long ones since you don't have to use a rack like you would for squatting or pressing/bench pressing, and can be done without a wide grip. 

Multiple small meals just make it easier to shove a lot of food in your face and reach your caloric goal without resorting to "nutritional garbage" (which can be delicious but void of interesting macro or micronutrients and full of calories). By having 6 or 7 small meals, you can keep them "healthy" and make the most of it. But that's it, if you can reach your macros in 3 meals all the better for you. 

The best thing I can think of not requiring too much equipment is a glute ham raise (GHR). It's the exercise that provides the most hamstring activation, well beyond even RDLs and hamstring curls. A GHR bench is probably the best way to do them but it is very easy to rig your own homegym GHR bench with very little: see this post for an example. 

You could do both. Increase volume first by adding reps up to 10, then increase the resistance and go back to 6 reps, rinse and repeat (that's called a double progression). 

Other factors might include anthropomorphic differences (limb length, bone size and density, etc.) and also the crucial fact that the men in your comparison have been training for multiple years with those hormonal levels, which accounts for a superior lean mass and thus superior strength. Female competitive powerlifters or weightlifters or bodybuilders are much, much stronger than the average (and even slightly above average) gym goer because they have spent more time training in an anabolic state than them (despite their sex difference). I'd recommend taking a look at the international rankings in powerliftingwatch.com for anyone who doesn't think that is the case. 

You are getting sore because you are dramatically increasing your volume (sets times reps times weight) instead of progressing it slowly, thus not recovering. Then even worse, you stop altogether, and start over at full speed which gives you more soreness. Take it slow, keep track of your volume per bodypart to learn how much you can get away with. Generally, doing more is always better from both strength and hypertrophy perspective but you need to work up to it over weeks, months and sometimes years in order to recover properly. When you start over again, remove some weight (keep 2/3 to 3/4 of the weight), and remove some sets (keep 2/3 of the sets) and keep the exercise selection very strict. On your first few sessions, you shouldn't be getting even near tiredness and you should leave the gym frustrated that you didn't do more. Then over the following few weeks, work up to the planned weight and sets by small increments. Then go past it, by doing more sets, using more weight. That's how progress is made, and it's the essence of progressive overload. 

It is a misconception that strength and hypertrophy are somehow mutually exclusive things. Keep in mind that the strongest powerlifters train like bodybuilders most of the time, where the main difference appears when peaking for a competition, where the powerlifters peak towards maximal strength rather than maximal leanness. The strength of a lifter depends on three factors: 

You cannot change (3) unless you go get very expensive surgery, so that's out of the question. Only (1) and (2) are somehow in your hands, and that's why we developed something called periodization, i.e. the training of multiple qualities (here hypertrophy, strength) over a period of time in order to maximize the overall performance of the athlete at the end of the cycle: you get bigger to improve (1), which gives your muscles more "room" to get stronger, which you take advantage of by then training for (2), which makes you stronger and lets you train for (1) with bigger weights, etc. They are two sides of the same thing! Now to answer your questions: 

If you are worried, just do that experiment: take a few days off pressing (to allow your fatigue to clear out) and then train a few weeks by shoulder pressing first and you will see that it has been going stronger all along without you noticing it. 

Your question can be answered by yes and no, depending on the level of your understanding of what strength is. Strength isn't a monotonously increasing quantity, it's a very chaotic variable that goes through deep valleys (when you are overreaching and accumulating a lot of fatigue through high volume training) and high peaks (when you are coming out of a successful peaking cycle). There is an excellent blog post by Bryce Lewis called Peaks & Valleys on that very topic. Most strength athletes spend a massive portion of their time in offseason training (searching for "offseason powerlifting" on Google yields a dozen fascinating results), which is usually hypertrophy specific. Research has shown that the cross-sectional area of a muscle is the most direct predictor of its strength and thus it stands to reason that increasing its size is the most reliable way to become stronger, in addition to the other benefits that it brings w.r.t health and longevity (bigger muscles can protect your joints in several physical activities, including lifting heavy weights, and help you maintain a leaner physique, which is good for both your lifespan and your quality of life). That being said, staying a long time in hypertrophy specific training will decrease the strength you can express at that instant. That doesn't mean that your muscles are becoming weaker, just that they adapt to the required demand and the required demand at that instant isn't to lift maximal loads. The strength will come back extremely fast with an appropriate intensification & realization/peaking cycle (do some research on block periodization if you want to learn more about that). You can help this happen faster by still practicing the sports-specific skills on which you would like to express your strength all throughout your hypertrophy cycle (so for instance, if you were training for a powerlifting meet, keeping a large portion of squat, bench press and deadlift along with your bodybuilding exercises during your hypertrophy cycle in order to practice your form with lower weights). 

It is actually both. Progressive overload applies to a stressor, meaning something that causes adaptation in your body. If you progressively overload a stressor that generates hypertrophy, you will continue progressing for hypertrophy. Same for strength, endurance, etc. Let's define volume as an abstract measure of "work". It is usually calculated as sets x reps x weight (also called "tonnage"). Let's define intensity as a measure of relative weight: it's the percentage of your 1 rep max in a lift. Regarding hypertrophy, the main hypothesis at the moment is that volume in the 40%+ intensity range governs its progress. Volume is an abstract measure of "work". It is usually calculated as sets x reps x weight. Applying progressive overload to it would then be increasing volume: from 4 sets of 6, work up to 4 sets of 8 and that will be an increase in volume from 24xWeight to 32xWeight. From 3x10 work up to 5x10 and that will be an increase from 30 to 50 reps. There is an alternative hypothesis which says that a better measure of volume for hypertrophy is the number of "hard" sets (meaning sets which you have a hard time finishing). Regarding strength, the main hypothesis is that it is governed by volume in the 70% to 90% intensity range. That's where the traditional linear progressions with sets of 5 come into play. In that case you could progressively overload by adding a bit of weight to the barbell everytime you come in the gym. Regarding work capacity (your ability to do a lot of volume in a short time), the main hypothesis is that it is governed by your ability to go back to your resting heart rate after training. You could progressively overload it by removing 10 seconds of rest between each set everytime you go in the gym. Or trying to do a number of repetitions with a given weight in a minimum number of sets. 

So first what you need to know is that chart, while a good general guideline, isn't the complete picture. You can achieve the same hypertrophy for instance while never lifting under 90%, provided you equate volume. Similarly, you can become very strong while spending most of your time under 70%. Second, to answer your question, all adaptations are not competing with each other and in fact some, like strength & hypertrophy, or strength & power, even tend to feed off each other where increased muscle mass will lead to a better strength potential, and a higher strength makes it easier to deploy that strength fast, developing more power. This is the essence of systems like Louie Simmons' version of the Conjugate System, popularized for powerlifting in Westside, where the lifters mix 3 types of training: repetition effort (hypertrophy oriented, long sets with low loads), dynamic effort (power oriented, several short sets with light loads and bands), and maximal effort (strength oriented, several short sets with maximal/circamaximal loads). Other adaptations like strength & endurance are a bit trickier to mix, because they don't tend to be very synergetic (although additional strength can help with endurance, by making the load feel lighter, and additional endurance can help with strength, by allowing you to train longer and more often). In that case the main approach to this kind of hybrid training, advised by some excellent athletes like Alex Viada (one of the rare persons who can brag about a 600+lbs deadlift and several marathons & triathlons under his belt) is to consolidate your stressors. Meaning you should train one quality at a time: this can be done at the weekly level (high rep low load and endurance stuff on Monday, low rep high load and high intensity stuff on Friday) or at the training block level (in a block periodization fashion, where you would focus on endurance and do minimal strength training focused on maintenance for several weeks, then switch around, leading up to a peaking block and a competition). 

Eat and train, no need to get fat. As you train, the calories you absorb will be allocated to either fat storage or muscle hypertrophy depending on something called your p-ratio. Sadly, your p-ratio gets worse as you get fatter* (iirc beyond 18% bodyfat for males), so I would encourage you to stay within a safe limit of that threshold. * fat tends to decrease your levels of free testosterone, which is why with the new trend of raw powerlifting (meaning without powerlifting gear that advantages fat lifters) most elite powerlifters now tend to be quite lean. 

It's a good question. It's called isometric training and some people swore by it in the beginning of the steroid era because they used it as an excuse for their incredible gains (while hiding that they actually came from pharmaceutical companies). It's not good or bad, it's a tool to increase time under tension. My personal opinion is that you should train a muscle the same way you are planning to use it, so if you find it useful to be in a position, train it. An example of that would be to progress a lift: if you find yourself for example constantly struggling in the same part of a bench press, removing some weight and pausing the movement in that part of the lift can help make you stronger at it, and overcome a plateau. Hypertrophy-wise, which might be what you are after, it was very big in the past with tempo reps (for example bench press 5x10 3-1-1 meaning 3 seconds eccentric/going down, 1 second isometric contraction at the bottom, 1 second concentric/going up) and is still present in a lot of bodybuilding programs. It will not make or break your program but it can be a fun addition if you get bored. 

If I understand your question well, and I'm not sure I do because it is honestly mangled, you are looking for a way to arrange your training week in order to develop both cardiovascular fitness and decent strength/hypertrophy, in a minimum amount of time. That is actually possible and usually called hybrid training (coach/runner/powerlifter Alex Viada has a book dedicated to the topic called Hybrid Training). Here is a loose plan and set of recommendations: 

You could alternate them (look up something called block periodization which deals with that) or train them concurrently (frequent in daily undulating periodization, concurrent periodization and the western-style conjugate training à la Westside) and alternate the emphasis, depending on your preference. This article gives a good review of different periodization models, but a bit of googling can give you a lot more results if you are curious. 

What would be better for you is to do a little of both, and a lot of sleeping & eating. You are still 19, when your hormones are still highly tuned for growing. Take advantage of the next 10 years before your testosterone starts naturally dropping and go train. I would recommend that you read this article by coach, writer and world record powerlifter Greg Nuckols: Why powerlifters should train more like bodybuilders 

There is nothing wrong about not being focused during your rest except for a loss of opportunity, because there is a number of things you could be doing to improve and make the most of your time at the gym: 

A (sports) physiotherapist would be able to answer that question better so I would encourage you to find one and ask them this question. If you can afford it, investing in a good pair of knee sleeves (both for the gym and for squash) like some Rehbands might be a good idea. They can help lock your knee in place and keep it warm during your training sessions. If you plan on keeping it on for a prolonged period of time do not buy one that is too tight. Anecdotally, I have managed my own knee pain by reinforcing the surrounding muscles, meaning doing a lot of leg curls (to reinforce my hamstrings) and squats/front squats (to reinforce my quadriceps). I avoid the leg extension machines are they can be bad for the knee joint (it depends on your leg proportions but I'd rather not take any risk). 

You need to do yourself a service and get out of your head the idea that you need to work maximally in order to make progress. It will help you not get hurt (which will lead to a longer, more productive lifting "career") and get stronger by ingraining proper technique. What do I mean by that: When you do a lift "fresh", you will be able to lift more weight. Every time you do a set, the weight you can lift diminishes. In that sense, your 5th set of bench isn't much different than your 1st set of shoulder press: your muscles are fatigued, they can lift less. And that is completely ok: research shows that what actually matters is the total overall volume (that is a somewhat abstract way of describing the amount of work done by a muscle, usually calculated as sets x reps x weight) that you inflicted on your muscles as well as the average effort of your lifts (that is whether you go close to mechanical failure). The volume part of the equation is tampered by the fact that you need to recover from it, so doing 100 sets of chest exercise is pointless if it leaves you paralyzed for 2 weeks because you could have done 200 sets in that same time frame if you cut it up in smaller portions which are easier to recover from. The effort part of the equation is tampered by the fact that you need to stay far enough from failure to maintain perfect technique, lest you will just ingrain bad technique, and that will lead to injury, which is why it is often recommended to leave one or two reps in the tank at all times. What does that mean for you? It means that if you bench first, you are inflicting some of that volume on your chest, shoulders and triceps (the prime movers in the bench). When you shoulder press, you are inflicting some volume on your shoulders and triceps, but those are already prefatigued from the bench. Instead of looking as a negative ("shit, I can't lift as much, I must be getting weaker/stalling") look at it as a positive (more volume => more progress) because you are winning on both sides:
