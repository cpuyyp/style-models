One way to approach this is to consider how our discussions on this topic will change as technology advances. Right now, age of viability (able to survive outside the uterus) is somewhere around 23 weeks. It used to be higher, and soon it will be lower. Does technology change the definition of person? I would propose that because the definition of "person" cannot allow for ambiguity and gray-zones (lacking a clear definition of "life" or "person" results in dangerous inconsistencies in discussions on policy, bioethics, and legality), then if one cannot define criteria for a toggle point, there cannot be a solid argument for any toggle point. Therefore, if none can be established, it defaults to the beginning of the line - the first point of formation of that unique individual human organism. I argue that the poorly-defined blanket term "person" should be eliminated, replaced with "human," and specific issues should be discussed directly - using accurate terminology of the human developmental stage or attributes that are appropriate to the issue. 

My perspective is as a family medicine doctor in training. Yes, I do find it unethical for doctors to refuse patients who cannot pay on the basis of increasing profits. I work in several underserved, safety-net clinics and hospitals that take all patients regardless of ability to pay. This is my career choice because I want to contribute to the solution of our broken system. These clinics have social workers and financial advocates that help uninsured patients try to get insurance or financial support to cover costs and allow them to get consistent healthcare. These clinics receive some funding from the government as well. None of these practices become filthy-rich, regardless if they are private or state or university-based. The practitioners are paid well, but not as much as in a private practice owned by the physician(s) who charge what they want and only take the insurances they want, rejecting anyone uninsured who can't pay up front. These income-driven physicians are pushing their self-pay (uninsured) patients towards the "safety-net clinics," causing these clinics to carry a high % of the burden of uninsured patients while receiving fewer insured patients to recover costs. That imbalances the distribution of reimbursement to practices. If there were limitless numbers of providers and clinics, it would be a minor issue. But there is very limited space in medical schools and residency training programs. There is a primary care physician shortage in the tens of thousands and rising. These profit-driven physicians are taking up spots in training programs that could instead be taken by people willing to accept a good (but not exorbitant) income while investing in balancing and improving the system, rather than just draining the profits of it. So in summary, yes I do find it unethical. But that is largely because it's in the setting of a broken, ineffective healthcare system (especially the insurance system) that drives costs excessively high and makes access to quality care a commodity, rather than a human right. 

The result of this body of work was a true change of tide in contemporary philosophy: today, many accept the existence of de re modalities, and endorse one version or other of the causal theory of proper names -- and post-Kripke descriptivism bears little resemblance to pre-Kripke descriptivism. This contemporary essentialism is, of course, a huge improvement above the Aristotelian variety. For one, it benefits from the advances in formal logic of the XXth century -- and one of the key developers of modal logic was Kripke himself --; it is also informed by contemporary science and contemporary linguistics, and, well, everything between Ancient Greece and now. If you have any more concrete interest on how contemporary essentialism differs from Aristotelian essentialism, let me know and I will try to elaborate (if I know anything about it). Kripke, S. 1980.

Well, such sentences will be true for all precisifications, because either Andy has n hairs or he doesn't, for all n. Therefore, the sentence comes out supertrue -- this is the supervaluationist for accepting it as true. Its negation ("it's not the case that Andy is bald or Andy is not bald"), by the same token, comes out superfalse. The same will happen with every other vague sentence: the supervaluationist semantics validates LEM. Supervaluationism is a semantics that validates LEM but not PB. 

is that such a statement is as hard to falsify as the original statement is to verify -- and, conversely, as easy (!) to verify as the original statement is to falsify. This point is not new, of course; it was already made by Hempel back in the day. 

The reason some empiricists (most notably Popper) have denied that we can verify an empirical hypothesis is that they were thinking of universally quantified statements such as 

Embryos are a stage in development of human organisms. To phrase the issue concisely: If something is X at the end of a time interval, then either it must become X during that interval, or else it must have been X from the start. Therefore, becoming X requires a distinct change - "person" is a binary distinction. There are no "half-person" or "3/7ths person" as valid options. But physiologically, genetically, biochemically, anatomically - all development is gradual. (Look at the above link and see how slowly we change - and remember that these are a small number of stop-motion frames over 9 months of gradual development in gestation.) After the formation of the zygote, there are strong scientific arguments that no single defining moment of change in the development from zygote through adult senescence is significant enough of a change to demarcate a change in status to toggle from "not a human life" to "human life." Nor from "not a person" to "is a person." (Even birth is a process of several hours to several days, and a journey of almost 2 feet. At what moment is it a human life or a person? Out with cord cut? Without it cut? Only head out? Cervix dilated?) Cognition is also a very gradual development that can vary widely between individuals. Discussions on this have very diverse opinions. I argue that if one cannot define criteria for a toggle point, there cannot be a solid argument for any point. Therefore, if no toggle point can be established, it defaults to the beginning of the line - the first point of formation of that particular human organism. Otherwise we are stuck in vagueness, ambiguity -- but this is a situation where there absolutely must be a definition; lacking a clear definition of "life" or "person" results in dangerous inconsistencies in discussions on policy, bioethics, and legality. 

I've been reading through the Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle, translated by Terence Irwin. I have found his work far more to my liking than that of Mills in Utilitarianism and the work of Kant. What I can't seem to nail down is the Virtue & the Vices which Aristotle associated with Pleasures in the daily life. This is the relevant excerpt I am examining: In Book II, Chapter 7 [The Particular Virtues of Character], S13 - In sources of pleasure in amusements let us call the intermediate person witty, and the condition wit; the excess buffoonery and the person who has it a buffoon; and the deficient person a sort of boor and the state boorishness. In the other sources of pleasure, those in daily life, let us call the person who is pleasant in the right way friendly, and the mean state friendliness. If someone goes to excess with no [ulterior] aim, he will be ingratiating; if he does it for his own advantage, a flatterer. The deficient person, unpleasant in everything, will be a sort of quarrelsome and ill-tempered person. Is he saying that for each pleasure it is the motive which dictate the action a virtue or a vice? 

I am in the process of responding to one of the latest Reading Comprehension Questions in my Ethics course. This week we were reading from pages 27-33 of Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics (2nd Ed.) Translated by Terence Irwin. The question posed is thus: Choose some virtue not discussed by Aristotle and present an Aristotelian analysis. Be sure to give a careful picture of what the virtue and its corresponding vices would look like. And the below is my drafted response. I was wondering if anyone could provide input, and see if there is anything I might be overlooking regarding the Aristotelian Analysis? RESPONSE: For my Virtue in this discussion I have chosen Forgiveness. This virtue is defined and described as follows: Being forgiving is giving someone another chance after they have done something wrong. Everyone makes mistakes. Instead of revenge, make amends. Forgive yourself too. Instead of feeling hopeless after a mistake, decide to act differently, and have faith that you can change. Forgiveness in many situations is difficult to give, to another entity and even to oneself. Even in my personal life, I currently struggle to forgive a person whom I care deeply for who has caused a lot of pain with their actions towards both myself and someone I also care deeply for. It has been several years since the hurtful actions took place, and while on the surface the relationships appear to have returned to normal, for me the pain is still there; deep and throbbing under the surface of every one of my thoughts. It has taken a lot of restraint on my end to keep myself from drifting into close companionship with the Bottle, or to lash out physically against the person or even my own surroundings. To forgive is to move on. To let the actions of the past remain in the past and look only towards the future. It also means to (still) continue to act as if the actions never occurred in the first place. It means to devalue the pain that was caused to the injured parties, and move forward as if “it was no big deal”. The virtuous act is to forgive in this situation, with hope and faith move forward that such actions will never occur again. But with no punishment of value having occurred to the actionable party to make up for their offense, I am not sure at this time I am capable of giving forgiveness. This is not to say in this situation I would like to see the other party punished, but I do not wish the injustice done to myself and the other party to be so devalued as to just be “swept under the rug”. In this situation I believe Aristotle would advise moving forward, to forgive. I think his justification would be more peace for the mind and body; to let the anger, hurt, and all the other whirlwind of emotions be let go of. No one benefits from the lack of forgiveness in this situation, and it only harms myself to not give it. To not forgive is a vice, as I will continue to hurt my own mental state and perhaps boil over to a point of harming even my physical state in some manner. But to just forgive I see also as a Vice, for there will have been no reprimand for the harmful actions and no justification (if there will ever be) for the harm befallen me. 

Science has limits. We use tools developed inside of a complex system to try to measure and model the system itself. It is likely impossible that we, as component parts of the system, could ever build a cohesive scientific model to accurately define the entire system. Science can only expand by extrapolating from our current models and rulesets. Philosophy is a different type of tool which can explore many things that the scientific method cannot. As such, it is essential. Lastly, philosophy has throughout history originated a good percentage of the concepts that science has explored and tested to construct these models. 

These are uncomfortable questions, but that's because the realities of these issues ARE uncomfortable. We try to hide behind the word "person" to shield us from the discomfort, but we can't change reality to fit our comfort levels. This would allow people of different belief systems to converse more logically about issues that absolutely must be discussed, without perpetuating the current cycle of conflict and misinformation. To summarize, by the argument I laid out (that if it is X at the end, if there is no significant switch, then it must be X from the start), there is not a good criteria for terminating another human's life at any developmental stage to use its cells. The term personhood is inadequate, and more objective terminology should be used in these discussions. Something important to also consider is that this issue will soon be outdated. Pluripotent stem cells are being generated from other sources, and it will soon replace the use of embryo tissues.  I hope this helps generate some interesting thought and discussion, and give you some points to research and consider further as you develop your presentation. 

Science is a method. The scientific method gives us tools to hypothesize and theorize models to fit what we currently observe about our universe. Science is not an absolute truth; our body of scientific knowledge is a collection of the best models we currently have. Many models are extremely strong, some are works in progress, and some are just starting to develop. We don't yet have models to fit absolutely everything that we observe, and there are also many things that we have not yet observed, could never observe directly, or have not yet even contemplated. We are inside of a complex system, doing our best to make models that explain the system. Physics is the primary tool that we use to explore models for the mechanics of the universe. We use our current theoretical models of the universe and extrapolate backwards in order to hypothesize what came before what we currently observe. The strongest theory I have ever read for the initial inciting force is the necessity for the existence of an "unmoved mover" (also called "prime mover"). It is philosophy that illuminated the unmoved mover. I would recommend reading about it. I will try to find a better link that Wikipedia, but it is a great start. Nothing from astrophysicists that I have read has presented a convincing-enough argument for what comes before the Big Bang. Many refer to a singularity, but the force that initiated the expansion of the universe has not been successfully modeled. This suggests that it is indeed philosophy that so far has been capable of going beyond the current scientific models proposed. (I consider religion as being an aspect of philosophy.) There are various proposed scenarios for the very early universe, most of which differ radically from one another. A discussion of some of them can be found in the Wikipedia entry on the Chronology of the Universe: 

What you have in mind is the principle of the identity of indiscernibles: the idea that no two different things can have the exact same properties. The SEP entry I've linked to above has a nice bibliography at the end. This principle entails your claim that no two things can ever be identical: if a and b are identical (i.e., if they have the same properties), then "a" and "b" are two names of the same thing. 

There is no accepted term for the study of change in metaphysics, analogous to ontology for the study of what there is, or mereology for the study of the parthood relation. Many scholars resort to the phrase "the problem of change", or "the problem of persistence". 

The right way to understand Mandelbrot's claim is: the coast of England can be profitably modelled as a fractal (for some purposes). It's exactly the same kind of claim as "The granma pie at Luigi's is a rectangle". So, no: the coast of England is not literally a fractal, and it's not in the world of forms -- it's actually in England :) 

Suppose that all names can be named. (Just like, for example, "Schiphol" is a name of my name.) If so, no name is enduring and unchanging. No paradox here either. On the other hand, maybe there is an enduring and unchanging name, and that name has no name. This is semantically implausible, but not paradoxical. Anyway, introducing the notation: Nxy: stands for the relation of x being a name of y We can say that a is a name iff there is an y such that Nay, and your second sentence can be rendered thus: 

is meaningful under the following interpretation: would be a plural constant designating a certain plurality of kids; a plural constant designating a certain plurality of plants, and designating the relation of shouting as above. Under this interpretation would be as well formed as , when used to mean that Socrates is a man. For the notions of plural constant and plurality see this.
