I would like to know if the Prolate Spheroidal Wavefunctions (PSWFs, defined below) are in $L^1(\mathbb{R})$. I know that they are square integrable, but cannot decide about absolute integrability. The Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions are eigenfunctions of the following integral equation: $$\int_{-T}^T\varphi_n(x) \text{sinc}(t-x) dx = \lambda_n \varphi_n(t)$$ where $\text{sinc}(t) = \sin(\pi t)/ \pi t$. Alternatively (as discovered by Slepian et al.) they are also the eigenfunctions of the following differential operator: $$(1-t^2)\frac{d^2\varphi_n}{dt^2}-2t\frac{d\varphi_n}{dt} -(2 \pi T \Omega)^2t^2 \varphi_n = \mu_n \varphi_n$$ The Prolates are bandlimited to $[-\Omega/2, \Omega/2]$ and maximally time-concentrated on the interval $[-T, T]$ (see the series of papers by David Slepian, Landau, and Pollack). As such they are entire functions in the complex variable $t$. 

I have worked for some time on the problem and made some progress. The argument is basically inductive. First all I would like to tell that this problem arises in Gabor Theory if one wants to prove that a Gabor frame can be generated by multiple prolate spheroidal wave functions i.e. if one wants to prove that the sequence $${e^{2 \pi i m b} \varphi_r(t-n a): m, n, r \in \mathbb{Z}, 0 \leq r \leq R-1}$$ forms a "frame" (using what is known as the Zak Transform). So far this has not been done in the literature on prolates or Gabor theory. The key is to take into consideration the well-known fact that the prolates form a Complete Chebychev system on the interval $[-1, 1]$. So (assuming $T$ and $\Omega$ are both 1) the following determinant is non-zero: $$ \Delta \left( {\begin{array}{cccc} \varphi_0 & \varphi_1 & \cdots & \varphi_r\\ x_0 & x_1 & \cdots & x_r\\ \end{array} } \right)= \mathrm{det}(\varphi_i(x_j))_{i,j=0}^{n}, \text{ }\forall r \in \mathbb{Z_+}, 0 \leq x_0< x_1 <\cdots< x_r \leq 1. $$ Writing out explicitly, the condition is given as: $$\left| \begin{array}{cccc} \varphi_0(x_0) & \varphi_0(x_1) & \cdots & \varphi_0(x_r)\\ \varphi_1(x_0) & \varphi_1(x_1) & \cdots & \varphi_1(x_r)\\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots\\ \varphi_r(x_0) & \varphi_r(x_1) & \cdots & \varphi_r(x_r)\\ \end{array} \right| \neq 0$$ for any finite set $\{x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_r\} \subseteq [0,1]$. I will give the simple argument for $p=2$ and $R \geq p$. I have even done it for $p=3$ but I need an elegant inductive argument for all $p$. Introduce the slight abuse of notation: $$ \varphi_r(i) \equiv \varphi_r\left(u+\frac{i}{p}\right), \text{ } i=0,1,\ldots, p-1 $$ For $R=2$ and $p=2$, $\mathrm{det}(\mathbf{S})$ reads: $$\left| \begin{array}{cccc} \varphi_0(0)\varphi_0(0)+\varphi_1(0)\varphi_1(0) & \varphi_0(0)\varphi_0(1)+\varphi_1(0)\varphi_1(1)\\ \varphi_0(1)\varphi_0(0)+\varphi_1(1)\varphi_1(0) & \varphi_0(1)\varphi_0(1)+\varphi_1(1)\varphi_1(1)\\ \end{array} \right|$$ This deteminant can be decomposed into four determinants as $$\left| \begin{array}{cc} \varphi_0(0)\varphi_0(0) & \varphi_0(0)\varphi_0(1) \\ \varphi_0(1)\varphi_0(0) & \varphi_0(1)\varphi_0(1) \end{array}\right| + \left| \begin{array}{cc} \varphi_1(0)\varphi_1(0) & \varphi_1(0)\varphi_1(1) \\ \varphi_1(1)\varphi_1(0) & \varphi_0(1)\varphi_1(1) \end{array}\right| + \left| \begin{array}{cc} \varphi_0(0)\varphi_0(0) & \varphi_1(0)\varphi_1(1) \\ \varphi_0(1)\varphi_0(0) & \varphi_1(1)\varphi_1(1) \end{array}\right| + \left| \begin{array}{cc} \varphi_1(0)\varphi_1(0) & \varphi_0(0)\varphi_0(1) \\ \varphi_1(1)\varphi_1(0) & \varphi_0(1)\varphi_0(1) \end{array}\right|$$ The first two determinants are easily seen to be zero, while the sum of the last two determinants is equal to (after taking out common factors in entries in a given column): $$\left| \begin{array}{cc} \varphi_0(0) & \varphi_0(1) \\ \varphi_1(0) & \varphi_1(1) \end{array}\right|^2$$ Which is postive by the Chebychev assumption. An inductive argument can be invoked for $R>2$. What I would request is a general inductive argument for all p, i.e., assuming $\mathrm{det}(\mathbf{S}) > 0$ for all $R \geq p=2$ and for a certain $p>2$ prove the proposition for $p+1$. 

Specifically I'm curious about the case when $V=\mathbb{A}^1_\mathbb{C}$. I think the answer to Question 1 is yes by the following line of reasoning. Deligne shows in Theorie de Hodge II that $\mathscr{A}$ is characterized by $(R^1f^\text{an}_\ast\underline{\mathbb{Z}})^\vee$ as polarizable variation of Hodge structure of type $\{(-1,0),(0,-1)\}$. Now, in our case we know that $(R^1f_\ast^\text{an}\underline{\mathbb{Z}})^\vee$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-local system and so trivial as such. But, of course, there is no a priori reason to believe that the Hodge filtration is constant. That said, in this article (see the remarks following Theorem 11) any $\mathbb{Q}$-VHS on a simply connected compactifiable complex manifold is actually constant (as a VHS). In particular, this should imply (since every smooth variety is compactifiable by resolution of singularities), by Deligne's theorem that there is a constant family $\underline{A}$ on $V$ and an isogeny $\varphi:\underline{A}\to\mathscr{A}$. But, $\varphi$ must be $\underline{\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}}$ and so $\mathscr{A}$ must be $\underline{A/(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})}$ as desired. Is this correct? It then leads to the following natural questions 

Euler wrote $a^4-d^4=c^4-b^4$ with $a=p+q, d=p−q, c=r+s$ and $b=r−s$, obtaining $pq(pp + qq) = rs(rr + ss)$, and then did several other special transformations, until he arrived at the special solution $$ a=p+q=2219449, c=r+s=1584749, $$ $$ b=r−s=−555617, d=p−q=−2061283 $$ which satisfies $a^4 + b^4 = c^4+d^4$. All the details can be found here: $URL$ 

Heaton showed that if the field $K$ has characteristic zero, then all polynomial cocycles are coboundaries. In characteristic $p$ this is not always the case, but the following result holds (which you may know already). THEOREM: For $n> 2$ and $K$ a field of characteristic $p$, every polynomial $n$-cocycle over $K$ of degree less than $p$ in the first indeterminate and less than $p-1$ in the second is a coboundary. It is not possible to relax the requirements given in the above theorem on the degrees; there are counterexamples, see R. Heaton: A Note on Polynomial Cocycles, Math. Zeitschr. 76, 2357-239 (1961). For a modern application, see for example chapter $1$ on formal groups (and symmetric polynomial cocycles) in the lecture notes on Shimura Varieties (class of Robert Kottwitz), see $URL$ under "Other Writings". 

The following may be well-known (or obviously false), but I can't find a counterexample or a reference. Suppose that $k$ is some perfect field (one can assume algebraically closed, if that makes you happy) and $X/k$ a connected $p$-divisible group. Suppose though that $X=\widehat{G}[p^\infty]$ where $\widehat{G}$ is a $p$-divisible formal group coming from the completion of some $G/k$. What is the connection between $D(X)$ and $H^1_\mathrm{crys}(G/W(k))$? If $G$ happens to be a super-singular abelian scheme, then we have equality (as follows from Mazur-Messing-Oda), and they are also equal then $G=\mathbf{G}_m$, but I don't know whether to expect equality in general. More generally, what are properties on $Y/k$ such that $H^1_\mathrm{crys}(Y/W(k))$ has slopes in $[0,1]$? Moreover, if it does, what can you say about the $X/k$ with $D(X)\cong H^1_\mathrm{crys}(Y/W(k))$—must it 'relate' to $X$ in any reasonable way? Thanks! EDIT: A helpful comment from a wise elder has suggested that one might be able to say that basically $G$ is semi-abelian and try to prove the result by proving it respects extensions. Have not run through the details, but it seems plausible. 

As far as I know the only groups known to have a Noetherian integral group ring are polycyclic-by-finite groups. This is often discussed in connection with the so-called "Zero Divisor Conjecture" for amenable groups of finite cohomological dimension, whose integral group ring is noetherian, e.g., see here (in particular, page $5$). 

Let $p(n)$ denote the number of partitions of a positive integer $n$. It seems to me that we have for all $n>25$ $$ p(n)^2>p(n-1)p(n+1). $$ In other words, the sequence $(p(n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is log-concave, or satisfies $PF_2$, with $$ \det \begin{pmatrix} p(n) & p(n+1) \cr p(n-1) & p(n) \end{pmatrix}>0 $$ for $n>25$. Is this true ? I could not find a reference in the literature so far. On the other hand, the partition function is really studied a lot. So it seems likely that this is known. Similarly, property $PF_3$, with the corresponding $3\times 3$ determinant, seems to hold for all $n>221$, too, and also $PF_4$ for all $n>657$. The question is also motivated from the study of Betti numbers for nilpotent Lie algebras, in particular filiform nilpotent Lie algebras. 

Does there exist $X/\mathbb{C}$ smooth projective and some $i>1$ such that $\pi_i^\mathrm{\acute{e}t}(X)=0$ but $\pi_i(X^\mathrm{an})\ne 0$? Does there even exist $X/\mathbb{C}$ smooth projective with $\pi_1^{\mathrm{\acute{e}t}}(X)=0$ but $\pi_1(X^\mathrm{an})\ne 0$? Does there even exist a connected compact Kähler manifold $X$ such that $\pi_1(X)\ne 0$ but $\widehat{\pi_1(X)}=0$ (profinite completion)? 

Let $S$ be a scheme (although I am more than happy to have $S=\text{Spec}(k)$ for a field $k$) and $\mathsf{AlgSp}/S$ the category of algebraic spaces over $S$. Does there exist an embedding $\varphi:\mathsf{AlgSp}/S\hookrightarrow \mathsf{LRS}$ (where $\mathsf{LRS}$ is the category of locally ringed spaces) such that we have a natural equivalence $$X\cong \text{Hom}_\text{LRS}(-,\varphi(X))$$ in the category of presheaves on $\mathsf{Sch}/S$? It would also be desirable to have that if $X$ is finite type over $\mathbb{C}$, that there is a map $X^\text{an}\to \varphi(X)$ which is initial amongst maps from $X^\text{an}$ to elements of $\varphi(X)$. 

Let $E$ be the matrix whos rows are $ \{e_i^{\top}\}_{i=1}^m$. Let $E$ also be a frame of $m$ elements for $\mathbb{R}^n$, $m \geq n$. This means there exist two constants $A, B > 0$ such that: $$ A\|x\|^2 \leq \sum_{i=1}^m |\langle x, e_i \rangle|^2 \leq B\|x\|^2, \text{ } \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n $$ Frames occur regularly in signal theory and wavelet/Gabor analysis. It can be shown that if a set forms a frame for a finite-dimensional vector space then it spans that space, however, it is not necessarily a linearly independent set. Corresponding to any frame $E$ is a (generally non-unique) dual frame $F$ consisting of the columns $\{f_i\}_{i=1}^m$ such that $$ FE = I_n $$ where $I_n$ is the $n\times n$ Identity matrix. I have an optimization problem concerning the duals with a given objective function and this duality condition as the constraint. I would like to know whether this constraint set can be interpreted as a manifold (matrix manifold) with some atlas? i.e., is it possible to construct an atlas for the set $$ \mathcal{M} = \{F: FE = I_n, E, F \text{ are frames for } \mathbb{R}^n ,E \text{ } \text{ fixed}\}? $$ 

I have the impression that even nowadays the term "metabelian" can be confusing if you talk about. Although I would also say, that it means $2$-step solvable now most of the time, it still can mean $2$-step nilpotent sometimes. In particular, "metabelian Lie algebras" can still mean $2$-step nilpotent Lie algebras, see the following (and other) articles: M. A. Gauger: On the Classification of Metabelian Lie Algebras (1973). E. M. Luks: What is the typical nilpotent Lie algebra ? (1977). L. Y. Galitski and D. A. Timashev: On the Classification of Metabelian Lie Algebras (1999). This is not an answer in the historical sense, but only a comment with too long references (which should perhaps belong to meta, if abelian belongs here). 

NB: I am a relative neophyte, so I would appreciate if any answer could be in as simple language as possible. Thanks! EDIT: There's also the following 'bonus question' if anyone feels up to it: 

I apologize if this is too basic for MO. I have an embarrassing admission to make: I don't know the actual definition of the discrete/continuous spectrum of a reductive group $G/\mathbb{Q}$ (in the context of automorphic forms if there is some ambiguity I'm unaware of).In particular, I know what the discrete series representations are for various groups $G$ (e.g. $\text{GL}_2$), and I assume that the discrete spectrum is made up of the discrete series (pluse extra! see the comments below), but I don't know how to define them in a general, 'elegant' way. I have the, possibly wildly incorrect, impression that the discrete spectrum of $G$ is the largest semisimple $(\mathfrak{g},K)\times G(\mathbb{A}^\infty)$-subrepresentation of $L^2(G(\mathbb{Q})\backslash G(\mathbb{A}))$ and that the continuous spectrum is the orthogonal complement of this which should be some sort of 'direct integral' over continuous parameters. But, to be honest, in the searching that I've done I haven't seen this explicitly stated. So, with this being said, I have the following three basic questions: 

The Elliott-Halberstam conjecture is not known to follow from GRH. Even the weak version of EH (which is with $Q=x^{1/2+\epsilon}$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$) does not follow from GRH. On the other hand, it is known that the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture almost implies the twin primes conjecture, i.e., it implies that there are infinitely many pairs of primes at distance $≤ 16$ (now $\le 12$, see Sylvain's comment). Furthermore, the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem is indeed an amazingly strong unconditional replacement for the GRH bound (and has as natural strengthening the EH conjecture). 

Over the complex numbers, connected linear algebraic groups correspond to Lie algebras in the usual way. This Lie correspondence breaks down over number fields, and breaks down even more over fields of prime characteristic. This was first shown by Chevalley in the early 1950s, and it started a search for a good substitute for the Lie algebra of an algebraic group. This involved formal groups, hyperalgebras, Lazard correspondence etc. For this see for example the book "Formal Groups and Applications" by Michiel Hazewinkel.
