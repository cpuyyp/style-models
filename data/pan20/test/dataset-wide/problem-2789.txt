This might be broad so let me narrow it. Concerning points and mereology, is it coherent to make points - extentionless entities - compose extended objects? If so, then the idea of "material point objects" is a coherent one and extension is no longer the primitive, defining characteristic of materiality/physicality. Extension is reducible to non-extension. Some might say, as I have seen, that material point objects are incoherent, and that points are, at best, merely a conceptual tool placed at certain locations on extended objects, and are thus neccisarily abstract. Extension is irredicble. By connection, physicality (objects that are extended) is an irreducible notion. To note, the people I have seen back the irreducibility of physicality are explicitely opposed to the idea of actual infinity. Material objects are not reducible to actually infinitely small extensionless simples. The material object would be annhilated at that point and would be indestinguishable from nothing. It is also possible that someone might object to extension being the defining characteristic of material things. One conversation that talked exactly about what I am looking for was with none other than ol' Kant and his antimony about the composition of material objects where he argued against ultimate extentionless simples. This ciew has fallen out of favor it seems. I've bought several metaphysics books hoping to get some commentary on points - material, conceptual, what have you - but have been disappointed so far because they seem more interested in other topics. What is the ontological status of points? 

It seems quite clear to me that the "neither view", wherin a neutral entity is one that is neither mental or physical, is a form of metaphysical realism. But it gets confusing, and perhaps downright impossible to make sense of, an entity which is BOTH mental and physical. To make matters even more confusing, in neutral monism there seem to be certain cases where the "subjective" and "objective" "become the identity realtion,"(1) that is, become the same thing only seen from different perspectives. This "neutral realism/new realism," as I have heard it called... is it a form of metaphysical realism? Or does it deserve some different designation? --Take "realism" (fundamentality of objectivity) here to be understood as the negation of "idealism" (fundamentality of subjectivity) as understood by someone like Berkeley --(1) "become the identity relation" taken from SEP on neutral monism 

This person is asking for some money to give me more money, however, he has actually sent me more money than I need to give, which is something a scam artist would never do. Well now I need to give just a little bit more money; however, he gave me money upfront, and only stupid people get scammed. So the check he gave me originally just bounced, and now I need to pay for taxes, but only idiots get scammed twice. Since I am not an idiot this cannot be a scam. Now I need to pay taxes for the other state, but since you would have to be a complete imbecilic to get scammed three times. Therefore this must be legit. 

This person is saying that H is false, because of A, but this is wrong because of F. This person is saying H is false because of A & B, but this can be disregarded because F and H has yielded true for a year. This person is saying H and F is false because of B & C, but because H has yielded true for two years this is not enough to disprove H. A through Z is being used to try and disprove H; however, because H has been proven to be true countless times for countless reasons H cannot be wrong no matter how unlikely it may seem. 

As time moves forward the amount of "proof" he has increases making the scam appear more legit. It doesn’t have to be because of something in particular it may just be the fact that he/she found it to be true a number of times. 

First off let's define what faith is, according to the primary dictionary definition (first def. listed in Oxford) faith is "Complete trust or confidence in someone or something". However, I would personally say that it is used also to specify the level of confidence, at least that's how I've heard it used. With that being said the definition which some others have used while also in the dictionary is that of blind faith, that is faith without reason. Nobody who is religious will use the word faith to imply blind faith, for the most part only atheists use it this way because many think that all faith in religious doctrine is blind faith, and because the word faith already has the connotation of being religious every time faith is used it naturally refers to blind faith. Using the standard definition of faith, the answer is yes we can trust scientists even if we do not fully understand the theories behind it. And yes this is faith. In fact, if we did not put faith in scientists we couldn't trust their experiments and we would never have gotten out of the stone age. Faith is a very important thing in academia because without all of the scientific information we would have would, would have to come from our own experimentation. Granted the word trust is more frequently used to describe this due to the religious connotation. Ultimately, what matters is the reason we have faith in the individuals whom we have gotten our information from. I would say that by saving millions of lives the doctors who work for the Red Cross are a pretty trustworthy, same goes for the engineers who build planes that can fly and everything else. And religious also have their reasons for believing in what they do, it might be difficult to understand such as when people claim of an internal divine revelation, but it is never for just no reason. Of course, the reasons for having faith might be ill-founded. 

Image Source: Lumen Learning Due to the fact that the superego is the moral centre of the person, a child (or adult) who has been brought up with the wrong societal mores instilled in them, will have a different balance between the superego and the id and ego. During an analysis of Melancholia and ‘introjection of the object’, Freud himself described the ego also being divided into two pieces, one of which rages against the second (Freud, 1921). On page 68, Freud indicated that the second piece is a piece of the ego which has been altered by introjection and the piece which rages against it 

I have been reading the Q&As on here regarding Freedom of Speech and in Do human rights exist?, @alanf said in his answer 

My understanding of this section of the book indicated that the second piece is the Id as it illustrates a psychological need which has been created by loss, and the other piece is the Super-ego. An imbalance between the Id and Super-ego has created the Melancholy and needs rectifying. Someone (a child or an adult) who has gone through the loss of a much loved pet or member of family, can in time rectify the imbalances between the Id, Super-ego and reality; and then move forward and self-actualise. However, someone who has lost their feeling of self-worth due to trauma for instance, is not going to self-actualise until they manage to get the correct help, support and guidance. The battle between the conscious and the unconscious through the Id, Super-ego, and ego, plus the reality of the situation needs addressing in order for the Ego to help the person to move forward and self-actualise. Another example I would use is a runaway child needs food and shelter. The shelter part might be more difficult initially, but due to the need for food, the Super-ego can be temporarily suppressed by the Id in order for the child to turn to stealing the food he/she needs to survive. Once this child has done this, the Super-ego can then have it’s say and the child will have the battle in their own head over the morals of what they have done. References Freud, S. S., 1921.

Well, we actually cannot be sure we won't be proven wrong. Among the most important things in science is to be willing to question everything and always be open to other possibilities. Appropriately every article describing a study will always list possible faults in the experiments. No experiment can determine things with a 100% accuracy, there will always be a 'what if' which can cause everything to fall apart. Saying things are 100% proven is not a good scientific practice, and can even be considered a red flag. (If that is the case that it is proven then you probably will have already heard a timbit or two about it). Although, the media always state things in terms of people like to hear (absolutes), so it might sound strange at first. Of course, we can still be 99.9999999999999999999999999% sure of things and this is enough for things to be 'proven'. But technically speaking in order to keep things falsifiable given enough evidence you should be willing to reject the theory that the Earth is relatively round, even if you are an astronaut you should be willing to believe it was all some Matrix-like simulation. For an example of how this all works, think about Newtonian physics. It is hard to argue that Newton's theories and equations, which are taught in schools and used in engineering to this day, were unscientific and should never have been taught. Yet we wouldn't have GPS if we were not willing to accept relativity. Not to mention Newtonian physics still describes principals in our world that need to be understood. So even if our most trusted theories are 'wrong' they are still bound to represent a simplified derivative of our reality, as well as be an astounding approximation for it. Finally, there are some problems with your question. You are speaking in terms of science being better than religion. The idea that religion is some kind of alternative conflicting system to science is one that only a negligible number of religious people actually have, and you will not be able to effectively communicate arguments with other people if you refer to their stance as being something which they vehemently deny. Your putting words in their mouth and this is a fallacy. It also says that you are unwilling to accept others beliefs since any scientific proof would automatically disconfirm itself in your opinion.
