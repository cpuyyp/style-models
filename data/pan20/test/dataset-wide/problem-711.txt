I have a bicycle with an internally geared hub (Rohloff). To tension the chain, I loosed the attachment of the rear wheel (dropouts), draw back the rear wheel, and tighten the attachment again. However, on one side, this mechanism is stuck. I've oiled it but it's still stuck. What can I try next? 

Riding against the flow of traffic is dangerous and illegal. If an intersection or a set of intersections does not permit you to ride safely, walk your bike. 

I am considering an anti-theft GPS tracker for my bicycle, but I am worried about battery life. Are there any that recharge from a hub dynamo? 

The owner's manual troubleshooting section has an item "twist shifter does not turn freely", but beyond 3 and 4, my twist shifter does not turn at all, not even under considerable force. When I do shift (heavily) between 3 and 4, I do see a slight movement in the cables. I am not able to manually pull the cables out of the gearbox. Until yesterday, shifting worked through all gears albeit somewhat heavily. I took the bicycle on a train, where I strapped it. After I got off the train, the problem appeared. What might cause this? 

Apart from a better health, a faster commute, a happier life, a better environment, and other factors, there aren't a lot of benefits. As for risks: it is easier and more attractive to steal a high-end 3000€ bicycle than to steal a crappy 3000€ car. If you cannot park it safely at home and at work, cycling on a good bicycle will leave you worrying about theft. Cycling on a crappy bicycle won't, but for a long distance commute a crappy bicycle will leave you slower and perhaps less happy than a good bicycle. (Of course, you don't need a €3000 bicycle for commuting) 

Since 6 years, I am the happy user of a bicycle with a Rohloff internal hub gear. German quality squeezing 14 gears and a 526% gear range into the rear hub. Less known is the newer and equally German Pinion gear, which reportedly has 18 maintenance-free gears and a 636% gear range — all squeezed into the bottom bracket. Wow. The Pinion website features the logos of many high-end touring brands like Santos, Idworx, and Koga. What are the advantages and disadvantages of squeezing the gears into the bottom bracket, as opposed to into the rear hub? 

I'm relatively new to mountain biking, and am considering purchasing a new, less expensive bike to help me learn to ride wooden obstacles (skinnies, curved bridges, etc.) without fear of damaging my "good" mountain bike in a hard fall. I've also wanted to pick up a snow bike (or "fat bike"), but can't really justify the cost considering my area gets, at most, 3 or so snowstorms per year. But looking at these two issues together makes me wonder: would the wider, lower-pressure tires on a snow bike make it easier to learn correct technique & feel for riding on slick, wooden obstacles? What would be the benefits/drawbacks of very wide vs. standard-width MTB tires in this scenario? 

The scenario: you're riding in a curb-adjacent, paint-only bike lane. You happen to look over your shoulder (or in your mirror) and see a vehicle approaching from behind, either fully in the bike lane, or close enough that they can't safely pass. Assume that veering to the inside of the approaching vehicle's path (away from the curb) is not an option, and that there is no time to slow and dismount onto the sidewalk. Is there any technique which can be used here to quickly lift the bike both up and to the side, while traveling at speed, such that you could safely continue your ride on the raised sidewalk until the danger has passed? Answers that do not require suspension would be ideal, and it would be especially helpful (though improbable) to find a technique that can also be used while carrying reasonably-weighted (~10 pounds) panniers on a rear rack. 

I've just recently replaced the brakes on my MTB with a pair of Shimano XT hydraulics. The rear brake line was extremely long for my frame's routing, so I had to cut it and subsequently bleed the system. For the most part, everything seems to have gone well; the rear brake lever is now very firm and responsive, slightly more so than the front (which I did not shorten or bleed). However, I've noticed that the rear brake lever no longer returns instantaneously. If I had to guess, I'd say it takes around 0.2 seconds to return from the fully depressed position. By contrast, the front lever returns so quickly that it makes a slight "snap" sound when it hits its limit. I replaced both the olive and needle insert when reinstalling the brake line. I noticed that both of these parts had a thick grease generously applied to them from the factory. I'm unsure if this is typical for Shimano brakes, though I've never seen pre-applied grease on the spares for Avid or Tektro brakes. I have a sneaking suspicion that this may be the culprit, but I'm not sure how to validate that without disassembling the brakes again and swapping in new connector spares. This doesn't seem to affect the brake's function right now, since the pads don't noticeably drag against the rotor during the return interval. But it does concern me that I may have done something wrong while reinstalling the brake line, and that this might be a precursor to more serious problems in the future. Any ideas what I might have done wrong, or how to further troubleshoot this issue? Some more details: 

Whereas on the other side of my bicycle, it does. This leaves me with the choice of cycling with a loose chain, or cycling with a slightly less loose chain but a rear wheel that isn't straight. Not a great choice. How can I unstuck this mechanism? I've already tried to oil it. Edit: The thing on the left (with a thread visible) is stuck. It is supposed to be connected to the thing sticking out on the right, but regardless of how much I loosed the thing sticking out on the right, the thing on the left won't move. Sorry, I don't know the right terminology. 

Can I use some gentle violence here, or do I need to unstuck the lid in a different way? I'm not sure if there is a thread inside the hole, and I'm not quite sure why the cap has ripples. I don't want to destroy anything. Note: I'm not sure if my terminology is correct overall 

In a narrow bike lane, there is insufficient space for one bicycle to safely overtake another. Therefore, to overtake another bicycle, you should pass into the car lane when it is safe to do so, overtake there, and then pass back into the bicycle lane, again when it is safe to do so. Change lanes for the overtake maneuver — just like you would in a car. In my opinion, you should not need to ring your bell when you overtake, unless several cyclists are cyclist abreast and making it impossible for anybody to pass, but this is more likely on a bike path than on a bike lane.

Preferably in an easy way so I can ride to an abandoned railway, attach some stuff, and continue onto the railway. Do any kits to easily convert a regular bicycle into a draisine exist? 

People who are sweating when cycling but not when walking are either cycling in hot weather (worse when steeply uphill with not enough gears), or treating a bicycle as a piece of sports equipment rather than a mode of transportation. When on foot, you walk rather than run. You don't need special clothes for walking or cycling. You do for running or racing. If you depart on time, you don't need to race. To get from the sport cycling mindset to the utility mindset, get a traditional bicycle where you sit upright. Mountain-bikes and racing bicycles have purpose; they are sports equipment. Utility bicycles are simply a way to get around. They're a lot more comfortable too.
