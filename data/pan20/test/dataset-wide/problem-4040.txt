I think Probability and Measure by Patrick Billingsley is what you're looking for. It contains all of the topics you're asking about (except maybe spectral theory), and I feel it does a good job introducing the world of probability to the reader without assuming you already understand it, which Durrett's book tends to do. 

Suppose I have a discrete-time Markov Chain (in an infinite dimensional state space $\Omega$) with Markov operator $P$, a linear operator on the space of bounded measurable functions on $\Omega$. (Or possibly some Banach space of functions, like Lipschitz functions) And suppose an invariant measure $\mu$ exists on $\Omega$, i.e., a measure such that for any bounded measurable function $g$ on $\Omega$, we have $$ \int_\Omega Pg \; \mathrm d \mu = \int_\Omega g \; \mathrm d \mu. $$ My general question is the following: 

Here's an explicit construction that gives a counterexample. For simplicity let $c=0$ (not important). First, let $\alpha>0$ and consider the probability that a standard Brownian motion started at 0 hits 0 at some time in the interval $(\alpha t, \alpha t+t)$. Then (1) this probability does not depend on $t$ (by Brownian scaling) -- call it $p_\alpha$; and (2) $p_\alpha\to 1$ as $\alpha\to 0$ (because with probability 1, the standard Brownian motion hits 0 at some time in the interval $(0,t)$). Now we'll use this and Borel-Cantelli to show that with positive probability, we can construct $\sigma$ and a sequence of times $t_n\uparrow 1$ such that $Y_{t_n}=1$ for all $n$. Let $\alpha_n$ be some sequence decreasing to 0 quickly enough that $\sum (1-p_{\alpha_n}) <\infty$. Let $t_0=0$ and recursively define $t_1, t_2, \dots$ as follows. Given $t_n<1$ and $Y(t_n)=0$, let $\sigma_t=\sqrt{\alpha_n}$ for $t\in(t_n, (1+t_n)/2)$, and let $\sigma_t=1$ for $t\in((1+t_n)/2, t_{n+1})$, where $t_{n+1}$ is defined by $t_{n+1}=\inf \big[ t>(1+t_n)/2: Y_t=0 \big]$. The idea of this definition: given $t_n<1$, we divide the remaining time interval $(t_n, 1)$ into two halves, and run BM at speed $\alpha_n$ on the first half and at speed 1 on the second half, stopping as soon as we hit 0 during the second half. Since we start at 0, the probability that we DO hit 0 at some point during the second half is easily seen to be $p_{\alpha_n}$ as defined above. Hence $P(t_{n+1}<1 | t_n<1)=p_{\alpha_n}$. Now using Borel-Cantelli (and reasoning straightforwardly about independence) we get that there is positive probability that $t_n<1$ for all $n$. In that case also $t_n\uparrow 1$ (since $1-t_{n+1}<(1-t_{n})/2$). Also $Y_{t_n}=0$ for all $n$ by construction. But the process $Y_t$ is continuous (since $\sigma_t$ is bounded). So then also $Y_1=0$ as desired. 

Theorem. The Galois group of a quintic polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is $A_5$ if and only if its discriminant is a rational square and its Weber sextic resolvent has no rational root. Question. What are known infinite families of of quintic polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, each with Galois group $A_5$? I am aware of two explicit such families as follows. Example 1. $f(x)=x^5+(5t^2-1)(5x+4)$ for $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $t\equiv\pm 1\pmod{21}$. This is Exercise 3.7.2 in the book Generic Polynomials by Jensen, Ledet and Yui. Example 2. $f(x)=x^5+(t^2-5^5)(x-4)$ for non-zero $t\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall u\in\mathbb{Q}: t\ne g(u)$ where $g(u)=\frac{(u^3-18u^2+8u-16)(u^3+2u^2+18u+4)}{2u^2(u^2+4)}$. This is from the paper Reducibility and the Galois group of a parametric family of quintic polynomials by Lavallee, Spearman and Williams. Note. Both are all trinomials, presumably because it is easier to construct polynomials with square discriminant when some coefficients vanish. It would be nice to see otherwise. 

Generate a sequence of $B$s and $R$s using Polya's urn as you describe, starting from $b$ blue and $r$ red balls; First randomly draw $p$ from a Beta$(b,r)$ distribution. Now, given $p$, generate an i.i.d. sequence of $B$s and $R$s in which each entry is an $B$ with probability $p$ and a $R$ with probability $1-p$. 

The key word is "percolation" and the literature is vast. Some good general references: Percolation (2nd ed.). Geoffrey Grimmett, Springer-Verlag, 1999 Percolation and disordered systems. Geoffrey Grimmett, lectures notes from the Saint-Flour summer school, 1996. Available from $URL$ , no.13 in the list of preprints. Percolation. Béla Bollobás and Oliver Riordan, Cambridge University Press, 2006 (terminology: broadly speaking, "random graph" tends to be used in a situation where there is no underlying geometric or spatial structure, while "percolation" tends to be used where there is some sort of underlying lattice or regular structure. But this is not a precise distinction and usage varies). 

The Computation Below is incorrect, but is left up as a learning tool. Please read the comments for details. Let $X_i$ be i.i.d. uniform r.v.'s on $[-1,1]$. If I compute $P_n$ for $n=3$, I don't get your value. Am I doing something wrong in my computation? I get the following: \begin{align} P_3 & = \mathbb{P}(X_1 > 0, \; X_2+X_1 > 0, \; X_3+X_2+X_1 > 0 ) \newline & = \frac{1}{8}\int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^1\mathbf{1}{\{x>0,\;y>-x,\;z>-(x+y)\}} dz\;dy\;dx \newline &= \frac{1}{8}\int_{0}^1 \int_{-x}^1 \int_{-(x+y)}^1 dz\;dy\;dx \newline &= \frac{1}{8}\int_{0}^1 \int_{-x}^1 (1+x+y) dy\;dx \newline & = \frac{1}{8}\int_{0}^1 (\frac{3}{2}+2x+\frac{x^2}{2}) dx \newline & = \frac{1}{3}. \end{align} This disagrees slightly with your formula, which gives $P_3 = \frac{5}{16}$. Let me know if I have misunderstood the problem or made an error, and I will remove this immediately. Otherwise, it seems like a possible answer to your question is to generalize this computation by an inductive argument. 

An irreducible quintic $f(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$, is solvable by radicals if and only if its sextic resolvent $\theta_f (y)=(y^3+py^2+qy+r)^2-2^{10}\Delta(f)y$ has a rational root ($\Delta$ is the discriminant of $f$, and $a,b,c$ are some defined rationals, see the Cox reference). In many cases, this associated sextic is not pretty. More troublesome is that in my work I am often coming across quintics with the coefficients in terms of some parameter, where in general we cannot use the Rational Root Test on the sextic. Any advice on proving the (non)existence of a rational root of the sextic resolvent of an irreducible rational quintic (especially sufficient criteria for non-existence)? Examples or references to special cases are fine. Is the usual technique just ad-hoc tricks? References: 

It converges to a strictly positive limit. Perhaps easiest to think about it in this way; assign every vertex an independent time which is uniform on $[0,1]$. If the vertices of $G_n$ are added in increasing order of their times, then this is equivalent to adding them one by one uniformly as you describe. But this way we can easily think about all the vertices in the infinite graph simultaneously. Now condition on the time of the root. Given that this time is $p$, the set of vertices preceding the root contains each other vertex independently with probability $p$. Call this the set of open vertices. Effectively this is percolation with a random probability $p$ (itself chosen uniformly on $[0,1]$). If we do percolation with probability $p$, then there exists an infinite open path starting from the root with positive probability iff $p>1/3$. This is almost the same as the probability of survival of a Galton-Watson branching process whose offspring distribution is Binomial($3,p$); the difference is that here the root has $4$ possible offspring, while each other vertex has only $3$. The probability (as a fuction of $p$) can be quite easily obtained as the solution of a recursive equation. To get the probability that the set of open vertices contains an infinite path from the root, integrate over $p$ from $1/3$ to $1$. The limit as $n\to\infty$ of the probability that the set of open vertices contains a path from the root to distance $n$ is then just this probability that the set of open vertices contains an infinite path from the root. 

The lamplighter group, defined as the wreath product $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, is amenable yet has exponential growth. It can be thought of as a bi-infinite sequence of street lamps, each of which can be turned on and off, and a lamplighter who moves along the sequence. The three generators of the group are to move the lamplighter right or left, and to switch the state of the lamp he is positioned in front of. With this picture in mind, it is easy to show the group has exponential growth. 

It's well known that information about the spectrum of $P$ can give information about convergence of the chain to $\mu$ (namely via the spectral gap and Markov mixing times), but what about the structure of $\mu$ itself? For example, if I know that $P$ can be written as a small $\epsilon$ perturbation of another operator, i.e., $P = P(\epsilon) = P_0 + \epsilon P_1$ with invariant measure $\mu(\epsilon)$, and I know that for all $\epsilon$ small enough, I know something about the spectrum of $P(\epsilon)$ (like perhaps that its essential spectrum is bounded away from $1$), can I determine that, for example, the function $\epsilon \mapsto \int g \; \mathrm d \mu(\epsilon)$ is analytic near $0$, for all bounded measurable $g$? 

Let us consider the equation $a^n+b^n=c^n$ for positive integers $a,b,c$ and $n\ge 2$. The $n=2$ case has a well-known and beautiful parametrization known as Pythagorean triples. Fermat's Last Theorem gives us that there are no solutions for $n\ge 3$. It can be observed from the literature that Diophantine equations involving a sum of individual variables to some like power, i.e. $a_1^n+\cdots+a_k^n=b_1^n+\cdots+b_m^n$, are considered to be among the most "attractive" of problems. Maybe with more controversy, it can be said that constructing (a family of) solutions is easier with a greater number of terms, thanks to the added flexibility. In this sense, Fermat's question of splitting a power into two same powers in the "tightest" question. This brings us to the next tightest equations, which add one more term: For which $n\ge 2$ do $a^n + b^n + c^n = d^n$ or $a^n + b^n = c^n + d^n$ (call them $(1)$ and $(2)$ respectively) have solutions in positive integers, what are some solutions, and can we find all of them? We are looking at non-trivial solutions, so in $(2)$, $a,b$ are distinct from $c,d$. Of course, families or full parametrizations represented by polynomials are the prettiest. I read somewhere that full ones exist for $n=2$ in each case, but a reference would be nice. Now $n\ge 3$ is a murky area, as far as I can tell. One famous result is Elkies' counterexamples to Euler's quartic conjecture, so $(1)$ has infinitely many solutions for $n=4$. The Mathworld pages on 3rd powers and 4th powers say that families of solutions to $(1)$ are known for $n=3$, as well as for $(2)$ for $n=3,4$. At this point, for larger $n$, there seem to be no known solutions to either equations; correct me otherwise please. So my question is: What are references to results on larger $n$ for these two equations? Has it been proven that no integer solutions exist for some, probably large, $n$? Maybe even all sufficiently large $n$? 

I've been reading Kato's book on Perturbation Theory, but there is no mention of measures. I also realize that you may need quite a bit more knowledge of $P$ to say anything conclusive, perhaps that it is self-adjoint on some Hilbert Space, etc... Just mention whatever assumptions are necessary when answering. I would also appreciate any references that may be helpful. This is a vague, open-ended question, so perhaps it should be a community wiki. Please comment if you think it should be and I can change it. 

It's not a movie, but the creator of the show Futurama is a computer scientist and one of the writers is a mathematician. It has quite a bit of mathematics in it, and a new combinatorics result was even proven to resolve the plot of the episode "The Prisoner of Benda"! $URL$ Here is a website devoted to the mathematics of Futurama: $URL$ In case you can't tell, I like Futurama.
