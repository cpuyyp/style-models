EV stay = $57.75K New job you are pretty much 100% to be like 92K (just two small raises) More learning and less stress EV leave = $92K EV leave / EV stay = 1.6 Work the numbers but even if they gave $100K it would not change the numbers. And they are more likely to fire - not just for the bigger number but because you negotiated and bigger number. I don't think a bigger number today from you current company gives you a better EV. It does not take a slide rule here to take the other offer. 

Your mental health is important and I like the answer from Avon +1. Mental health is not a card or an excuse. If you are having anxiety, depression, and loss of appetite that is real. From the perspective of the company when they hired you did they tell you that travel was possible. If this is a consulting company it should be no surprise to you that consultants travel to customer site. Yes deal with your mental health and talk to your boss but be prepared for travel is an expectation of the job. Hopefully they will not tell travel next week or you are fired but they may tell you we don't have a long term position for you. I get you already have anxiety, depression, and loss of appetite and that statement is not going to help that but that is a reality. Don't use the term mental health with you employer unless you seek medical help as then it does come off as an excuse. If it rises to medical health then you need to treat it. 

To follow up on a comment If it was software development I just know I produce quality code would not be a good answer. I perform unit testing and prefer tool x and y ... is a good answer. I do my job as a team member is not a good answer. I have participated on large and small teams and enjoy that environment. I listen to team members and am careful to follow the direction from the team lead and complete my tasks on time. In a team environment I have the opportunity to learn from others. My technical strengths are X and as I demonstrate those skills I notice that people will ask for help and I am happy to contribute in that manner. 

IANAL (I am not a lawyer) After you consult your company you should consult a lawyer Put your intentions in writing Software does not typically have any patents. They would need a unique algorithm. Software is copyrighted. Unless you received non disclose information from the 3rd party software I don't see any problem there. Since you would be still working with the vendor it would be hard to separate your corporate job from your freelance job. Not income but if is something you just plain want to do then you could open source it. 

Likely nothing good would come from this. You complained once as an employee and got fired. You think complaining again as contractor will go better? As contractor you are just paid to do your job. If you do send an anonymous email then you need to work on your writing. Capitalize i and don't put a space before . 

YOU GOT PLAYED. I know caps is shouting but YOU GOT PLAYED. Consider yourself lucky to still have a job. Lay low and think 3 times and research before you challenge any new approach. A contractor (or even an employee) should never user the phrase "It is not acceptable to us". 

It would almost have been better if they had not asked you to quote a rate. Ideally you would show value before you negotiate a rate. I don't agree with djechlin that you have your greatest leverage right now. My thought is go in with you current rate but cap it at like 8 or 20 hours. If they like your work you have a better change of getting closer to that $55. If you go in now at like $35 to get the work then you are locked in. 

If you really want the job why not? It is pretty harmless. Maybe they want to learn more about how you present yourself and how you handle stress. Maybe the job requires you to do errands or other odd stuff and want to know how you react. If you are a bad singer and would be embarrassed then decline. You can always decide later to not take the job if it is offered to you. If you think they are doing it to demean you then decline. 

To me a programmer is not frontline even if you do interact with the client. A programmer is a professional like a Dr, lawyer, or school school teacher. In a retail setting it would be people that interact directly with the customer. In a manufacturing setting I would call a laborer on the floor front line. 

They may actually be looking for people that want to get a graduate degree. Many companies pay for graduate school. E.G. If you get and MBA going part time that is good for the company. If the offer is in a town without a university then no is probably the safe bet. If the town has a university then I would ask "do you encourage graduate degrees". If they say no then tell them no you are not interested in grad school. If they say yes then tell them you would strongly consider. On my first job they asked why I would want to work here and I told them because I have been accepted to graduate school here. There are just a couple classes I want that are only offered during the day any chance I could take some day classes. They were said yes and gave me a job offer that day. And they paid for grad school. I was even able to use work assignments as graduate projects. 

But YOU are not harming the client. The client harmed themselves by going with an incompetent outsourcing agency. I would argue that you are actually harming the company by helping the agency as they might not figure out they have an incompetent outsourcing agency - or figure it out after paying them for a year. It is one thing if they asked some one time questions. From what you say they are just plain incompetent. I bet they just put Joe or whoever was available on the task with no regard for proper skills. 

You can ask but it probably won't be received well. You have 5 months. They need to plan budget and recruiting so they want to get a count. 

If they don't know the company then telling them the company is big deal to me almost highlights you are switching industries and that is not something you want a hiring manager to pick up on. You should focus on your skills and responsibilities. If you lead a team of 40 that speaks for itself. If the skill are transferable and you get to an actual manager if the company is respected someone will be aware. At least one IT geek is gong to know gaming. The name of the company does matter if they know the company. If it is known respected company with a strict hiring criteria and a corporate culture admired by the company you are applying with then yes that is a good thing. In the interview you are still going to have to prove yourself but the right company might give you a likely fit that may help you get the interview. Like a college. If I got an MBA from Stanford then I am going to get a lot of interviews but I will still need to back that up in the interview process before I am hired. 

Start is very fluid. If they just got funding the money may have required them to change focus. The money may have told them what resources to use. Money rules. 

If your boss instructed you to not take your assistant to an extended lunch then you have done something wrong. Boss gets to decide what is wrong. If you did in fact go to an extended lunch then it is not a lie (let alone blatant). How do you handle you manager? You do what he instructed you to do - apologize. 

Sure it shows ability to work with a team and a sense of service. It is a job if you got paid. As an IT person I was on the fire team at a refinery as I was non-essential personal. I got to go to fire school at Texas A&M. 

You don't speak of a team lead or manager. I see a potentially bad pattern. Accept you have expertise in R and statistics and he does not. You should be performing the training and he should attend. He excludes you from open communication on an individual level. And now he is excluding you on team level. There is not a good reason for 4 team members to have regular brainstorming sessions on a subject and exclude the 1 team member with expertise in that subject. Devils advocate is that he wants to exclude you on a larger level. Is your manager / lead aware of your expertise in R and statistics? Who assigns programming tasks? 

I would not delete your LinkedIn but that is just an opinion. Your resume should map to your LinkeIn but there is a lot of wiggle room there. You could tone down your LinkedIn and stay within honest. In the cover letter just state you are looking for technical role. Your experience as manager has been valuable and rewarding but you find that technical is your true calling. Don't say it is because you are stressed out. As a technical person you are not necessarily overqualified. You just need to convince them you are looking for a technical position and will stay around. 

To some people the outside of your cubical facing a frequently used walkway is public space. If you just leave it inside where the 'vandal' is putting it, that should probably end the problem. 

My advice is to set some objectives and time frames. Have the finances to support the risks. If this is a company you have been with for a while and no chance of it getting better then one thing. I have had many transfers or new positions I did not like but I always told myself give it 6 months. Only once at the end of 6 months did I decide to leave. From there I went with two start ups that went bankrupt to consulting during the Internet boom for good money to starting my own company. And the only part I regret is starting my own company. Is the new opportunity out of frustration? Think it through and make the right transition. 

Don't just receive the bonus. Cash it before you turn in your notice just to safe. It is not about your boss. It just takes one person to abuse it. I have heard of it happening. If you have a good relationship with your boss I don't see how waiting for bonus to pay out would be harmful. The bonus is based on what you have done - it is not a prepayment. If you resigned on Dec 1 your boss would probably wonder why you did not wait for the bonus. The bonus does not come out of your boss's check. 

Not your job - you have not (yet) been tasked with coordinating vendor correspondence. Manager X should provide you with a status. Where you do need to be careful is of let's say the project is completed and someone is hurt based on a design flaw. Your report could be used to show the company knew about the design flaw. But that is again not your problem. You have been tasked with review the work undertaken by the contracts and ensure it is technically proficient with no direct authority. 

If it was / is theft is a legal question We can definitely call it questionable. When you first engaged you did not know it was questionable but you continued after you realized it was questionable. So it is down to a risk analysis of: 

That is not just a personal hygiene problem that is bad manners in general. If they are not considerate of others then they are most likely not going to accept input. Often you have a break between ordering and being served. Use that as a time to go to the restroom and wash your hands. It is a good idea to wash your hands before eating in general. If it is a food court with no readily available restroom then it will typically be informal and less chance of shaking hands. If there is open food bar my policy is get some quick and just not eat after that person. As a last resort "Just washed my hands and am getting ready to eat". Or "Just went to the restroom and did not wash my hands and you are getting ready to eat." 

Have better more prepared presentation with an agenda or outline. Have sharp handouts with more detail than the presentation. They may not ask if they see it is something you are planning to cover. If not a lot of pages include the actual analysis as an attachment. Anticipate questions and have good answers. Don't interrupt your boss but if he she misses something important then add it. And I don't mean this is a passive aggressive way but reply to your boss not them. Don't take control let control come to you. Be short. Ask - "did I answer your question". 

If it is legal is a legal question and off topic for this site. The law differs country to country. Let's assume it is legal. If this was legitimate then most likely it would have been done at the mail server level or Group Policy so she would not know. If these emails were going to multiple parties they had to notice. FW will be in the subject and the mail sent to you. I have not verified but if they really were forwarded then they should be in the sent items folder. I would go to your boss. As it is also kind of a violation of his/her privacy if his/her emails were forwarded. If you don't feel like you got a good answer from your boss then you can go to HR. 

If you really think it is just a few hours and will get you paid them maybe just do it. But it can get out of hand quickly. Even if you do quote E, F, and G separate then I would still ask for payment on the first. 

Equity is typically in the form of stock options. When they go public you can exercise your options at a set price that is hopefully lower than the public price. Outright equity is not always a good thing and then you would have part of the debt if they are in debt. Check with the company. A salary and stock options is pretty common with a startup. And you need to be careful as they could award you 20,000 stock options at $x and end up awarding too many that they do a reverse split and your 20,000 options become 2,000. Stock options are also a tax advantage to the company. 

He asked you to resign and you had a perfect response "It's your call". Since you are still working then it should be clear his call was to not have you resign. It was just a comment at a meeting - it will pass. 

Mixed. A lot of it is the attitude of the union. Unions are territorial. I worked in a refinery as staff and we interacted with union all the time. When it came time for union to re-negotiate a contract we would just keep a polite distance. As staff if they went out on strike we would be their replacement. Even good friends of mine would not address me at work. HR should meet with the union rep. Tell them straight don't know if it is true or not but it is considered bullying. Telling union people how to behave is problematic. But, you can educate the non-union. Tell them it could be a hostile environment. Don't engage the union in a negative manner even if they start it. Bring any issue to management. Management should notify the union rep. The union rep needs to be informed good or bad - they hate surprises. It was not an error mixing but you should have seen this coming. One guy? Pick two or more and pick some of your better people. If there is an altercation you need a non-union witness as you are likely to get one story from the union. Have management around the first few days. In this case I would not inform the union rep as you don't need their permission.
