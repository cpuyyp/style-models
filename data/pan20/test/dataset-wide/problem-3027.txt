The Rise of Christianity, Chapter I: Conversion and Christian Growth' Rodney Stark, p. 13 The 40% per decade trend ended around 350 CE, because there simply weren't enough people for the trend to continue - if it had, there would have been nearly 190 million Christians in the Empire by the year 400 CE, which would be more than three times the total population of the Empire. Suffice to say that by 400, or 450 at the latest, virtually everyone in the Empire was Christian. Today, there are well over a billion Christians in the world, and no religion has ever been so influential in shaping the course of human events, for better or worse. From Wikipedia: 

How widespread was support of Nazi policies in the United States during WWII? The short answer is "Not very, especially after Kristallnacht". The easiest way to get an idea of how many people fervently supported Nazi Germany is to check the membership size of the German-American Bund in America in this period; according to the website for the American Holocaust Museum, it was actually rather small: 

In "percentages agreement", Stalin and Churchill allegedly divided Southeastern Europe to sphere of influences of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. According to Churchill's account quoted by wikipedia, 

Do you really think that a superpower country can be defended by a population of less than 200, including troops and civilians? No doubt this is a simplification to make the game playable, and there is always such compromise in any commercial game. What normally happens is a trade-off between accuracy, playability, feasibility and cost. The optimal amount of accuracy differs from player from player, for example some people are bothered that the musket fire animation does not look like an actual musket fire from the era, but other people don't even notice that part and are more bothered by how simple and inaccurate diplomacy between countries is, or how they can't have population larger than 200. That's why any question regarding a commercial game's accuracy is hard to answer objectively, unless you are asking about a very specific aspect, for example, "Is the depiction of British Redcoats uniform in this game accurate"? 

In fact, when Ford found the spurious (and libelous) anti-Semitic hoax document known as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, he believed it to be genuine, and reprinted several sections of it in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent: 

Number of Extant VLFBERHT swords: I came across the closest available approximation to an answer we're likely to get: 

According to several sites - none of which offer sources or citations - the Arc De Triomphe de l'Étoile was damaged on or near the same day that the Battle of Verdun began in February 1916. These sites, including this one, claim that the Sword held by the Republic on the La Marseillais relief broke off. Some accounts go on to say that the damage was immediately concealed behind a tarp to prevent people from treating the damage as an omen portending disaster: 

This account comes to us in what is at least the third hand; the servant, presumably John Pernier, related the story to Captain Gilbert Russell, the commanding officer of Fort Pickering, at Chickasaw Bluffs, Tennessee, who later wrote a series of letters to William Clark. When Lewis had arrived at Fort Pickering, he was "in a state of mental derangement", and apparently drinking quite heavily; after he attempted to commit suicide, Russell "detained" Lewis in his personal quarters for about two weeks for his own safety. I have also heard that in his last hours, among other ravings, Lewis claimed that Clark was on his way to find Lewis and help him, but I haven't been able to find the source of this claim. Did Lewis have any reason to believe that Clark was coming to see him, and/or render some sort of assistance to him? 

Recently I read about Charles Dickinson, and his death on a duel with Andrew Jackson (then a general, later a US President). According to this link, Jackson killed him in a breach of dueling etiquette 

I was reading the Wikipedia entry for the War of the Bavarian Succession, and it said (my emphasis): 

This page contains a list of Nuremberg defendants, their verdict and sentence. While explanations for lighter sentence (e.g. Dönitz was only sentenced to 10 years) can be found quite easily, many Nazi leaders were sentenced to death or life imprisonment, and it seems quite arbitrary. What criteria did the trials use to decide whether to sentence someone to death or life imprisonment? Was there a precedent for this distinction? 

The Wikipedia page for the Schmalkaldic War list the Duchy of Saxony and the Electorate of Saxony as opposing sides of the war, each with their own monarch (Maurice is the Duke of Saxony, John Frederick I is the Elector). From reading the rest of the page, looks like John Frederick I is the main leader of Saxony. What was the Duchy of Saxony then? Was it a subordinate territory to the Electorate? Or was it a different land, ruled independently from the Electorate? Or was it just a title, like the "Prince of Wales" in the UK does not really rule Wales? How did it come to be separate from the Electorate? Another curious thing is that in the succession box below their articles, Wikipedia claims that after the Elector's defeat, they exchanged their title (Maurice became Elector, JF became Duke). Why did they grant the Duke title to the defeated Elector? 

The picture shows the skeletal corpse of a dead German infantryman (the helmet is clearly German) outside a dugout shelter. It has become fairly famous, and is featured in the opening credits of the classic BBC documentary series The Great War. The fact that the body was left in situ long enough for the flesh to decay completely suggests to me that it may be from one of the most lengthy engagements on the Western Front - perhaps the Somme Campaign or the Battle of Verdun, either late in the battle or shortly after it ended, but this is just an informed guess. Do we know who this man was, where and when the picture was taken, or anything else about it? 

It began near the nexus of 3 continents: Europe, Asia, and Africa. It began during the Roman Empire, while the Empire was still relatively strong and robust, and controlled much of Europe and the Mediterranean, including North Africa. It had access to an extensive network of roads, and it had never been so easy to travel great distances. In Paul's letter to the Romans, he says he is planning a trip to Spain. He traveled throughout Asia Minor, Palestine, Greece, Macedonia, etc. By our modern standards, this wouldn't be very impressive, but this was happening 2,000 years ago, when the closest thing to an airplane was a horse. People could travel more easily than ever before. After the message of Christianity was altered to make it less Jewish in nature, it became fairly inclusive; but the earliest converts were Hellenized Jews. Thus, communities with a decent number of Hellenized Jews would be most willing to convert. It was relatively unique in that it was a religion of belief rather than mere observance. This appealed to certain groups (again, Hellenized Jews), but it took some getting used to for pagans. It was also relatively unique in that it made promises of eternal rewards for the people who had been denied rewards in life. This idea was new to pagans, but familiar to Jews. It was evangelical, and some of the apostles were brilliant PR men. The first apostles were Jewish, and shunned pagans (because Jesus apparently told them to do so). Shortly after Jesus died, the new movement began to alter his message. This process has continued to this day, although at a much less drastic rate after the first couple of centuries. This is a huge benefit because it allowed the early church to become whatever its congregants needed it to be. This is when the scattered "shotgun pattern" begins to seep outwards and saturate the map. 

Some societies use sunset as the end of one day, and the start of the next: this is recorded in Genesis, chapter 1; for example, the Athenians, or see the Jewish civil day Some traditional agricultural societies start the day with dawn, but Roman civil society defined the day as beginning at midnight. The day was divided into ante meridiem (am) and post meridiem (pm), where the meridian refers to local noon. Twelve hours later is midnight, the sixth hour of the night, and the beginning of the next day. 

Iraqi Body Count maintains an online database of incidents with analysis as to the cause of the deaths reported. The link provided allows you to select the various actors who have been determined by their analysis to be responsible for the deaths. Selecting just those deaths directly determined to be due to the actions of the US-led coalition, the total from 2003 until 2016 is 14,338. This is out of a total of perhaps 181,337 total civilian deaths. Note that most of the coalition related civilian deaths occurred during the active period of the war, the first two months: over 7,000 civilian deaths. The incident database documents each incident recorded. Their methodology is described here. 

The article shown in this picture led to the publication of Ford's anti-Semitic screed, The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem, which was translated into German and became one of Adolf Hitler's inspirations. It is said that Ford is the only American mentioned in Hitler's autobiographical political manifesto Mein Kampf. 

Obviously, Jesus never makes any kind of claims about his divinity or messianic status, but we see something close to it - a Jewish writer making reference to the fact that Jesus "was called Christ". The specific use of the word "called" implies that Josephus doesn't necessarily share this assessment, but it does make it clear that he was aware that other people had called Jesus "Christ". 

Obviously, no one expected that the Hindenburg would explode during the mooring process, so it the expectation would have been that a passenger aircraft was going to arrive, the passengers would disembark, and that would be it. This wasn't the first time that a zeppelin had crossed the Atlantic; it wasn't even the first time the Hindenburg itself had crossed the Atlantic. So why was a reporter from Chicago in New Jersey to report on the Hindenburg's arrival? 

Was this an acceptable behaviour according to duelling customs at that time? If yes, why did the locals complain about it? If no, why didn't Dickinson's second do something about it? 

There are many aspects of a computer game - gameplay, graphics, storyline, mechanics, etc. and it is always necessary for a game to simplify or distort the history a little bit, otherwise it becomes unplayable, or very expensive/difficult to develop. For example, I quickly scanned the Wikipedia article you cited and found 

There was no "Israel" at that time. The Kingdom of Judah was conquered by Babylonia at 587 BC, see Siege of Jerusalem 587 BC. In 539 BCE the Persians conquered Babylonia, and established the Yehud province, which were a peaceful part of the Achaemenid Persian Empire until the fall of the Empire in c. 333 BCE to Alexander the Great. Wikipedia even has a section describing the biblical version of this period: Biblical version of the Persian years (539-332 BCE) 

The second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War may be a good example. There was a civil war between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party (CPC) factions, and in the middle of this Japan invaded. Both KMT and CPC resisted the Japanese, and at some point they even (nominally) cooperated. This cooperation was brief, however, and there were major clashes between these factions since 1941 (while they were also fighting the Japanese). 

A wide variety of data is available on "The Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilization (DARMC) makes freely available on the internet the best available materials for a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) approach to mapping and spatial analysis of the Roman and medieval worlds. DARMC allows innovative spatial and temporal analyses of all aspects of the civilizations of western Eurasia in the first 1500 years of our era, as well as the generation of original maps illustrating differing aspects of ancient and medieval civilization. A work in progress with no claim to definitiveness, it has been built in less than three years by a dedicated team of Harvard undergraduates, graduate students, research scholars and one professor, with some valuable contributions from younger and more senior scholars at other institutions. For more details on who we are, please see the People page." Alas, no population studies, except for an archaeological study of rat populations by region. Roman Empire population statistics are very limited. Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones discuss the problems and provide their best guesses in "Atlas of World Population History", a Penguin Reference Book, 1978. They provide references to published sources.
