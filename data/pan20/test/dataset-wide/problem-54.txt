However, you can bootstrap a civilisation to any given level of technology by providing sufficient education methods within only a few generations. The difference between current technology and that of 1000 years ago is simply that today's engineers were taught on material 1000 years newer. There is nothing that prevents setting up a modern-day technical university in the middle ages - if you could somehow provide it with electricity, and all the supplies (food, chemicals, metals etc.) that it requires as part of tuition. 

First off: There is a case of a Russian family surviving with no human contact for 40 years, including raising some children. Of course, that is on Earth which is (all things considered) a fairly habitable environment. Where things become interesting is if the environment isn't normal. For example, growing up in a very small environment would likely result in the development of several phobias upon being exposed to the rest of the world. Similarly, if "outside" is space or water, the concept of walking around in a field of grass would be incredibly daunting. And then there's the physical aspect of, particularly, space. A human being can jump at about three meters per second (a 40cm jump). In a small confined environment, you'll find yourself heading head-first for the opposite wall [ceiling?] at three meters per second. For an adult, we can control ourselves so long as we don't get a shock. But a child, assuming they don't have weaker muscles or simply grow up used to the environment will be a hazard to themselves. I can't imagine an eight-year-old not enjoying a bit of rough and tumble, and in space that will be very dangerous. I am of the opinion that a young child is very very adaptable. While in the modern age we note that children after earthquakes get PTSD, in my opinion this is a survival mechanism. I suspect that even if we neglected a lot of things in the upbringing of our children (after all, robot's can't provide love and probably lack in emotional support), the only result will be that the child would be perceived as "strange" in modern society. Take them back to the middle ages when population groups were a lot smaller and they'd probably fit in better. Anything not mirroring current society will result in a child that is not 'normal' by current societies standards. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Developing a lot of 'loners' may be useful if they're living on a space station that only houses 100 people. 

They attach very solidly (Nearly impossible to remove by hand), and I think that if they were upscaled they could indeed work for holding containers onto spacecraft. They can clamp any piece of ferrous metal. As they currently are designed, they do not require any power to hold in either the on or the off position, and the force required to toggle them is tiny compared to the force they can exert. If you want them to automatically engage when power is not applied, then the addition of a rotary spring to auto-rotate the magnet into the "on" position should allow this. 

Common table salt melts at 801 degrees Celcius, yet a glass of water will do it at room temperature. So you are quite right when you say that there is likely some other way to "melt" the ice into a form that the plant can use. However, melting ice is an endothermic reaction (takes energy), and that energy has to come from somewhere - thus either the plant must expend energy, or the environment will grow colder and reduce the effectiveness of whatever is melting the ice. You also have the issue that solid chunks of ice - even very small ones - are not readily transported around within a plant, nor absorbed by the root system. Hence, I propose: 

Oxygen could easily be provided/available. Divers tanks exist, canned air for climbing Mt Everest exists, and I wouldn't be surprised if something like the jedi breathing device: $URL$ is possible at some point - though how you keep it in the guys mouth, and how you stop air exiting his nose is an issue. Probably some sort of face mask is better. Your major issue is pressure difference. Without compensation, this causes the air in the lungs to expand and rupture the internal tissues (worse now we have a breathing device), and causes the water on your skin to sublimate. In the space suits used by NASA this is dealt with by pressurising the air around the person (inflating the space suit), but more modern concepts have had a form-fitting space-suit that applies pressure directly. Of course, the suit should still be air-tight over most of the surface. The final issue is temperature. Your survivor needs both heating and cooling. Think about how hot you get standing in the full sun. Now imagine that there wasn't an atmosphere to attenuate the sunlight. But on the side in shadow you probably need heating. 100W over a 2m black body sits at 172Kelvin - well below freezing. But given that your guy is has a face mask and is wearing special clothing, why not just put him in a (slightly futuristic) space suit. 

I will add that if the constants do change value, but do so very fast, then you will probably not notice any effect. I can't see that we could have an experiement to see if the speed of light changes every femtosecond, and I can't see that it would cause any measurable effect either. However, this may well explain some of the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. Also see Diracs Large number hypothesis. 

I would keep the hands without webbing. Otherwise your humanoid will have issues working with tools (etc). I like the choice of adding lots of extra limbs. On the whole I'd say this is one of the more sane winged humanoid designs: 

These already exist, and are called Magnetic Bases. They are used for attaching tools onto workshop equipment: 

With current technology, no. In near future, probably also not. In far future, there are other issues. With current technology the cost of the energy storage far exceeds the value of the energy that is stored. A quick check of hobbyking tells me that a 24Wh lithium battery costs \$8. The electricity to charge it? At 14c per KWh, it costs \$0.003 to charge it. Lithium is a rare and reactive material, so I don't see the cost of batteries dropping below their charge. In the near future with, the two may become comparable. And if we start shipping uranium as 'batteries' for nuclear reactors, then we probably go into the 'feasible' basket - but then we're shipping radioactive rather than electricity. The issue here is that electricity is super super hard to store in large amounts. 

Figuring out minimum time for technology A space fairing colony starts from zero. The reason? A technologically advanced society has a huge support base. To build a laptop requires an industry of millions of people. So what societal level can 600 people sustain? Then we can figure out how long it took us to upskill from there. Let's take a quick detour to the cities. Manhatten is 1.636 million people according to google. Rome was 450,000 at it's peak in 25BC. Apparently Baghdad got to around 1 million in 735AD, and with the advent of mechanical help, London and the UK surpassed our 1.6 million threshold in the 1800's. (Data from here). So what technology did they have in the 1800's? And how fast can we boostrap to it? A quick brainstorm tells me that our society should probably have: 

Let's have a look at the total energy required. There is the formula: E = 1/2 mv^2, and in this case you get: 

We have a situation thousands of times worse. The ground will also change shape massively, forming new canyons. Big rivers can pulverise rock, so I think it's fair to assume nothing big of your civilisation is left. Maybe small chunks of ground up concrete and shards of metal, but likely nothing easily identifiable. 

Your modern computer is blindingly fast. A quad core 3Ghz i7 with hyperthreading does in excess of 12e9 computations per second. A GTX1080 GPU has ~2600 cores at ~1.6ghz, or 4,160e9 computations per second. Your brain, on the other hand, has 100e9 neurons all working in parallel. A neuron can fire about 200 times per second. giving us a rate of 20,000,e9 firings(?) per second. So if we say that it takes 100 computer instructions (number pulled from hat) to simulate a neuron and ignore our ram requirements and lookup times. If we load that onto a single GTX 1080, and if we somehow assemble the neurons into a brain, how fast will it run? On a single GTX1080, it will be 500 times slower ignoring ram lookups, assuming 100 instructions per neuron. 

In order of plausibility: Your box could be an incinerator (scrambles at molecular level) You put things in (eg paper) and out it comes in the form of steam, carbon dioxide, carbon (solid), and various trace elements fused into a weak solid called ash. In essence, it generically melts, disassociates and combusts everything it can. This won't change anything at the subatomic level, but it may fit your requirements without requiring hand-wavium. As for what you could find when you put a person in? Well, um, do some research on cremation. Wikipedia lists things like calcium phosphates, various salts, as well as the gaseous forms of sulphur and carbon compounds. How to make this incinerator more awesome 

Able to survive. An intelligent creature needs to be able to learn, and to do so, it needs to not die the instant it is touched. Humans are pretty tough creatures. You can cut our limbs off and we don't die. Try that with some other animals and you'll find yourself with a carcass. A creature much frailer than it's environment will not be able to develop tool use as they will never be able to learn from mistakes. This is again closely linked to environment. A human is completely unable to survive underwater, and a fish unable to survive on land. Just because a species is not robust in a gravitation field, on earth, at standard temperatures and pressures, does not prevent it from achieving technical intelligence in some other environment. 

It will always interfere with instruments, but so long as it's either constant or predictable, then it can be filtered out from the instruments readings. This is how a lot of earth based astronomy is performed, as earth has a magnetic field, it's atmosphere gets in the way of our images (and spectroscopy etc). But readings take from Earth are still useful because we can predict the impact on the readings, and subtract them from the result. 

Let it use lasers It uses the heat output from radioactive decay. This may also result in the formation of radioactive compounds for interest - satisfying in part the "subatomic" thing. 

Stretch thin wire and rope from ramparts to battlements to towers Even if it isn't strong enough to damage the flying [dragon, hawk-man, roc], the risk of them getting tangled/falling to your troops below should help keep the skies in the immediate vicinity of your castle clear. Yes, a creature like a dragon could burn through it, that's why you make it thin enough that they can't see it easily. This means the dragon is forced to expend energy in fiery/acid/ice breath when anywhere near the castle's sky. Barrage balloons Barrage balloons were used in the world wars to help prevent against dive-bombing aircraft. I think they should work against dive-bombing dragons. One disadvantage against dragons compared to aircraft is that dragons have fiery breath, and aircraft bullets do not tend to set things alight. So you may need to enchant your barrage balloons against fire. Barrage balloons require higher technology level compared to just stringing ropes around, but will defend your castle higher up. This prevents dragons from carrying stones aloft and dropping them on your troops. 

If you have multiple cables (as per your diagram) or a revolving one, you've hugely increased the cost of the elevator. You've also made it harder to manufacture, so it will require longer to build - again driving the cost up. Conslusion So if you have handwavium'ly strong cable, your engineers are fantastic at designing fail-proof systems, and you have a high budget you can make it work. Ways of powering a climber that I can think (and hence by no means exhaustive) of include: 

Up until two hundred years ago, electricity was valueless in that it didn't exist. In the future it may fall into obsolescence. I mean, can you imagine trying to ship around pressurised tanks to provide power for hydraulic or pneumatic systems? That's the sort of thing you are proposing. We are currently in the electricity age, so this kind-of makes sense, but I suspect another energy source will come along to replace it. 

You may also want to read up on the sorts of failures that occur on spacecraft. To my knowledge there was only one case of sudden fatal decompression - the Soyuz 11. In that case it was a valve to a jettisoned part of the capsule that had become stuck open, not any sort of 'hull breach'. In any case, sudden depresurisation is considered something of a design flaw in spacecraft. 

How long would a Walmart last having food objects inside? A couple of weeks for dry goods (pasta, flour etc.) Meat may have to be eaten soon. If power stays on (and it likely would for at least a week or two), then up to a month. Remember, you've lost 80% of your population, so if the shop normally has stocks for a week, it now has stocks for five weeks. What would be the governance, if any? None, small groups are self-governing (I seem to recall that groups of ~120 tend to be crime-free as everyone will know exactly who did it). A formal governance bureaucracy would take a fair while to re-form. If all the people get put back to work farming properly, then I'd expect a feudal system to develop with the "farm kids" at the top (as they own the land, the food, and thus have the power) How long would it take for a city/town to make its new laws? As soon as it reaches stability, so probably six months to a year past the "event." Before then it will be a little hit-and-miss, but I suspect most kids would respect sensible practices for the first while. Many children mature very fast when responsibility is dropped on them, so the "off the rail" kids will not break society - they will stop messing around and start working. People doing real physical work to survive tend not to care about making laws. What about the "ecosystem"? It'll enjoy the fact that mining has stopped, that cars aren't driving and that people aren't logging forests. Many animals will find their habitats are no longer endangered by humans. Remember, the earth population has dropped from 8 billion to 2 billion.... What animals would be affected by the disappearance of adults? Probably the ones in zoo's mostly. They'll probably die or get eaten. Hoever, nearly all poachers in Africa disappeared, so any wild animals will like it - so long as they don't start being viewed as a food resource. Pets will turn feral - many will die. How long would medicines in a pharmacy last? A very long time. Probably until there were adults again. I mean, seriously, how many medicines do kids take compared to the elderly?
