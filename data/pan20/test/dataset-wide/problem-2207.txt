Homer ref won't call a foul/violation on home players unless the fouls or obvious or don't effect the game. Example - visiting team has 8 fouls called on them and home team has been to the line 6 times. Four minutes to go in the half homer ref notices that home team has 2 fouls. So he starts whistling reach-ins. Really good homer ref will call said reach-in after a home player has been beat badly, negating points while getting the fouls "even". A really really good homer ref will have a foul on the visiting team's star player within 5 minutes and two by halftime for sure. Favorite player ref. There are refs that get enthralled with a player's style. So that ref will let said player do whatever. Usually said player is a smooth dribbler and good shooter. I have seen refs miss 10 carries in a game because the player looked smooth while carrying. Can't handle big-boy ref. This is not so much in the NBA since almost every team has 4-6 big/fast players. But go to a college/high school game and this is a prevailing issue. If you are 6-6 250, built, and fast... Chances are that if you touch a guard its a foul and if you get hit while laying the ball up... well you can handle it. The puppetmaster ref. And I think this is mainly what you are referring to. These are the refs that feel like their job is to create the best show. They will make sure that the stars don't get in foul trouble, they will try to keep the score close by fouls/violations. The good ones are subtle and an average fan would never suspect anything, the bad ones do things like call the foul on the player next to the star. The racist/biased ref. Hey it's out there. The NBA's own ref data that was published a few years ago showed that white refs called more fouls on black players than white players (per minute average). And at even a greater rate, black refs called more fouls on white players (and way more violations). 

Of course, you might argue that if a team really wants to deliberately lose, it can still deliberately field all its substitute players even when the starting players are healthy, and play sluggishly without actually putting the ball into their own net. Such a behavior would be muddier to judge. However, I don't think there would be any case where a team really wants to lose a game on its own: it simply makes no sense for them. If that happens, it's almost surely because of bribery from another team, and in such a case it would certainly be a breach of rules. 

You can't foul a teammate, unless what you did actually led to some other fouls (e.g. pushing a teammate to trip an opponent). However if you start an argument/fight with your teammate, i.e. display "unsporting behavior", then you both could be punished by the referee with admonitions, yellow cards or red cards. This will probably still not grant the opponent a free kick, though. An infamous example: Kieron Dyer and Lee Bowyer punching each other in a PL game in 2005 and both getting sent off, despite them being on the same team: $URL$ 

Why not let the end WRs/TEs line up where they want? Because coaches will use that grey area to help spring their extra backfield personal to crack block the end in the back and so on. (remember there is no clipping on the line) You let me put two extra guys in the backfield and that is a huge advantage. The other part of this is just the essence of the game. The 5 blockers vs 5 WRs is balance. If there were less blockers the game may look like flag football, the field might not be wide enough, there would be more blowouts, more emphasis on QBs (meaning a team with a bad QB has no chance at all like they have much of a chance now) and so on. The reason why football is so well received is that there are positions for certain types of players. It is a chess match. This balance is well crafted in the rules, even if the rules just "got lucky". But I doubt the rules just got it lucky - I am sure there were some very bright people thinking about the game they were crafting. 

You obviously cannot unilaterally announce to terminate the contract. Imagine telling your boss one day that you're "retiring" from the business only to emerge one week later at a competitor. Does it make any sense? The common usage of "retirement" in football usually comes after the player's contract has ended. 

China is an obvious example. Hong Kong and Macau, despite being officially returned to China, are still highly autonomous and have their respective sports teams. Also Taiwan is not normally internationally recognized as a country but they reached an agreement with China to enter sports competitions with the name "Chinese Taipei" (Taipei is the capital city of Taiwan island). 

AFAIK there is no rule against such situation yet, as explained by a journalistic article I read (I think it's on Guardian but currently I can't find exactly where). Maybe there will be future rules preventing conflict of interest, but not now. Actually, Pozzo also owns Watford in England in addition to these two teams, and he already operated a lot of player transfers between the clubs to work around financial fair play restrictions. I don't think he was in any way punished or is in the danger of being punished because of those operations. 

All turnovers are reviewed. Your logic linking fumbles and turnovers is flawed. Why not review every time a DB might have intercepted the ball using the same logic? The NFL already has guidelines for this. Each team has two challenges and a third if their first two were right. I cannot remember one game since replay started that a coach challenged three times and won and there was another blown call. Why aren't all fumbles reviewed? Because it would be agonizing having to stop the game every time there was a bad snap or missed hand off. 

Brady wears a Riddell VSR4. It is a common helmet in the NFL. It might be the most common. Note that this helmet has a more traditional look, unlike most Schutt helmets or the Riddell Revolution. The facemask is your run of the mill QB facemask too, so not really sure where you are going with Brady looking different. If anything the VSR4 might be used by Brady so he looks better. It is one of the lowest rated (for concussions) new helmets. The only other reason I could think of is that the extra gear (speakers) that he needs fit better in the VSR4. 

Deliberately losing the game is unsportsmanlike behavior, puts the intended third team under unjust competition conditions and will be punished by the regulatory body, very possibly severely (point deduction and even relegation). Scoring a deliberate own goal is one of such an obvious behavior. Fielding an under-strength team, on the other hand, is allowed. However, in most cases it's not because the team want to deliberately lose the game. It's because of the tight schedule and thus the need to rest key players and rotate the squad. This is why a team has 25 players registered, not 18. 

If one just takes your question by its title then obviously there are plenty of strikers who also comply significant defensive roles. In fact in the famous game Football Manager there is a specifically designed role called "Defensive Forward" who closes down the opponent a lot and try to tackle. In real life the most famous example of such a forward is Wayne Rooney, who besides his attacking talents also retrace back very deep into his own half and tackle opponents very well. If you want to ask "a player who has played both as a striker and as a defender" then such an example is probably much harder to find, especially at top European football. One close example would be Fernando Hierro who had a remarkable score rate even though he played as a defender. He once even scored a hattrick in La Liga and he's the 4th highest score for Spanish national team. For a not-so-famous player, the Chinese player Fan Zhiyi who won Asian Footballer of the Year plays as both central forward and defender. Well actually he participated in 2002 World Cup so that fulfills your requirement here.
