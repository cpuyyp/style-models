As far as I can tell, the biggest factor influencing bicycle tires has to do with the 4th bullet point you mentioned, sidewall stiffness, combined with using inner tubes instead of just being a pneumatic tire. Cross-ply tires with their more rigid sidewall would be less prone to snakebite punctures of tubes and would hold rims off the ground with less pressure. Radials would have more of a propensity for the sidewall to collapse with low pressures. 

To start with, it's almost impossible to over grease a BB. It could literally be packed in grease and would work just fine. Too much may slow it down a tiny bit, but really, riding it you wouldn't notice. Grease is simply too viscous to cause a lot of friction. It's much more likely it's over tightened or has damaged bearings. Also, with some cheap sealed bearings there could be a short "wear-in" period during which it may not spin freely, but will act looser over time. Depending on the type of Bottom Bracket, you really could be having any number of smaller problems, but I would start with bearing tension(if it's a loose ball BB), or feel if the bearings themselves spin freely without the crank spindle installed(if it's a sealed system). Or if the spindle spins smoothly(if it's a cartridge like a square taper or Splined), and go from there. 

A tube is a sealed system. If the rubber isn't punctured and the valve is closed, there isn't anywhere that air could have gone all at once like that. The only thing I can think of is maybe you do have a small blowout tire side, and somehow the tube is sitting flush against the tire in such a way that it's holding it closed for now. May be worth taking the tire off and checking the tube itself, being prepared to replace it. Because(in the one in a billion chance that this is what happened), if that did happen, it could be hazardous to keep riding on it. 

The good news is those bolts aren't load bearing parts directly. The bad news is those are holding the load-bearing parts in place, so a failure of the bolt will allow the pivots to fail very quickly. I'd strongly recommend taking them out and getting replacements from the maker of your frame. Have a look at the answers to this question about shearing rotor bolts notice how little beef there is between the head and the shaft? Damage to bolt heads needs to be fixed. 

hold the top tube between your thighs, the down tube between your calf muscles. Hold the tops of your bars and push away from you. This duplicates the previous test but from the other side of the headset. 

You have a 10 speed cassette, so you need a hub that takes a 10 speed cassette. I believe 8-11 are all the same depth but the inter-cog spacing drops. You probably will get a new skewer with your new wheel. They're relatively cheap, you probably want a 135mm long one for the rear. Your bike does not suit through-axles so you require QR-based wheels, or wheels that have adapters for QRs. Wearing away like this might be a sign of something else being wrong. Yes, but it gets messy very fast. Refer to the large collection of existing Q&A on this: 

If its at a point where the hose bends naturally, then it could be weakened by flexing. What about temperature? Could it be the hose is simply perishing with age? Heat accelerates aging, so if its been hot or in sunlight for a while it will age quicker. Look very closely at the split. Is it smooth or slightly rough? If its smooth, consider a sharp object may be involved. Or is the hose getting caught under a weight, or in a door or track? Do you have cats or kids ? One has claws and the other can have scissors. Answer: Time for a new length of pressure hose with the right Internal Diameter. Outer diameter is less important, and matters only at the ends.. inside Get a couple metres and fit it. You may need some small hose clamps too. Do try and repair it, a good pump should last a hundred years. 

All I see are a Sun Ringle CR-18 and a cheap steel rim from Wheel Master. The CR-18 is definitely the stronger of those, it's a double-wall with eyelets. If you're looking for durability, those are very good. 

If I have a wheel listed as 8-10 speed Campy compatible, will a 11-speed Campagnolo cassette fit it? I seem to remember that they didn't change their standards when they moved to 11-speed, unlike Shimano and SRAM. I just don't have enough experience with Campy to say for sure. Anyone out there done this conversion and can tell me for sure? 

Skipping like that is usually worn cassette, chain or chainring(or all 3). Considering it's only doing it in the highest gears, my first guess would have been the cassette. But since it's only a month old, it's much more likely to be the derailleur is mis-aligned just a little bit. You say the derailleur is "ever so slightly bent", that little bit can make a big difference if it's out of alignment with the gears. Also, as Criggie says in the comments, the cables "settle in" a little after about a month or 2 of riding, that's very common, and the reason most shops offer a free tuneup in the first year you own a new bike. May be worth checking to see if the shop you got it from offers one. 

There is one more method people here aren't talking about... Sit on a bike on a trainer, get into riding position, and have someone you don't mind touching you physically measure your sit bones, in proper riding position. You can feel someone's sit bones on their butt. They're pretty obvious once you're touching them. 

Depends how you feel on the day, and what's coming up later. Sticking with your FTP may be too conservative to win the day, but if its just one of a series of climbs then working at your FTP may burn you out too soon. Standard advise is to carry all the momentum into the climb that you can, getting you some distance up. Drop gears to keep your cadence up. Then keep working till a third to half-way up the grade. At that point you stock take yourself - decide how much you have left. If the finish is at the top then go for it, but if there's hours more riding after this climb then just maintain. When the top comes in sight, add effort like your mum/SO is watching. You can recover on the downhill. 

Pitlocks - replace the seatpost quick release with a bolt that needs a special tool to undo. Buy this at the same time you buy the seat and post. Plain old bolts rather than Quick Releases 

A bike 18 months old is very unlikely to have a friction shifter. Did you mean its an older bike that you bought 18 months ago? Raise the bike off the ground, either in a stand or hang it from a tree branch or rafters by rope. Then slowly pedal with your hand while pulling on the inner gear wire whereever you can get to it (front downtube is normal) You should see the Rear Derailleur move through its whole arc of motion and the gear change should happen. This would isolate the problem to your shifter's mechanism. If the gear change doesn't happen, the problem is at the back. Consider posting some photos once you've had a closer look. 

I've driven up to the visitor station but not up to the summit - what are the road conditions like beyond the visitor station, where can you refill water, and should I prepare for anything beyond a leg crushing day? I'll be starting on Kona (west) side, in September, and am expecting about 6-7 hours of straight climbing. Here's about all I know so far; 

Most of the road shoes I've found only seem to be rated to around 25° or so. Living in New England I'd like something colder. Does anyone know of road shoes rated for colder temps? (They'll be used for commuting and weekend road rides) Update: I have new Neoprene booties (Pearl Izumi Elite Barrier Shoe Cover) but find that they're only comfortable down to about 25°F or so. 

I have the bench mount PCS-12 but am looking to convert it to a floor mount. I haven't been able to find the base for the PCS-10, only the entire unit. Any suggestions? thanks 

I'm considering getting a trailer bike for my 3 year old (image below) but want to know if it will help or hurt progression toward him riding independently. He's amazingly fast on his Strider no-pedal balance bike but hasn't shown much interest in riding his 12" "real" bike with training wheels. I'm hoping a trailer bike might help him bridge the gap but in the interest of getting him to ride his real bike independently, would the trailer bike help or hurt the cause? Thanks 

I'm familiar with Jonathan O'Keeffe's Strava Multiple Ride Mapper (tied to the Strava API) but I'm interested in mapping all activities in a certain geopgraphy, not just those I've done. My goal is to find new trails that I haven't explored so I'm interested in seeing all activities in a region from all users. (Bonus points if it can then remove the roads/trails that I've logged activities on.) ref: $URL$ 

Remember there's nothing wrong with multiple lights. If one stops when riding you generally don't notice until the ride's over. 

From your photo I think the bike is a bitser, and without decals/names/markings its very hard to identify. The front fork is clearly labelled Giant and has straight tines so its relatively modern. Possibly a carbon or aluminium alloy fork, it doesn't look like a steel fork. Fork is also painted completely different to frame, so they're not originally together. Fork is also threadless at the top, which is quite modern. The frame would have had a quill stem when new. However the hoods and brake levers are 80s or possibly early 90s. They're not combined brifters, the shifters are on the downtube which is completely 80s. The horizontal top tube looks 90s when considering its aluminium alloy. Thicker walled aluminium was used when it was a new material for framebuilding, and hydroforming wasn't possible so strength was added with bulk. The rear wheel cutout in the seat tube is for aerodynamic reasons - it smooths the airflow a bit, but the main advantage was to permit a shorter wheelbase while retaining 700c wheels. The road double chainrings are not a compact, instead they're quite close together in size. Not sure what that implies, other than few hills. Identifying steel is easy - touch it with a magnet (like an old hard drive magnet) and see if it attracts. Aluminium or titanium won't attract a magnet. To tell Aluminium from Titanium is harder - neither require painting. Titanium will spark a lot, bright blue/white when touched with a grinder, and aluminium won't really spark at all. If you can get to a bare piece of metal, apply a moist cathode (paper towel) to the positive-attached metal. 9v should do to get a slight tan tinge. 18v (2x9v batteries) will take you to dark violet. Some of these requires taking off a patch of surface coating, so not a first option.
