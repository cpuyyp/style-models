Footnotes: A. Highly competitive (50 over) = lost by 2 wickets or less, lost by 30 runs or less, or official tournament/match referee and/or umpires joint assessment, in writing, that match was well and truly in the balance with 10 overs or less remaining B. Highly competitive (20 over) = lost by 2 wickets or less, lost by 15 runs or less, or official tournament/match referee and/or umpires joint assessment, in writing, that match was well and truly in the balance with 4 overs or less remaining Source: 1.

Why not? Suppose a team scored 280 runs in 50 overs. Team batting second gets target of 271 in 45 overs. If they score 270 after 45 overs, the match will be tied. Another simple example: A match is affected by rain before the match is started. So when the match is started it is reduced to 40 overs per side. If both teams score same runs the match will be tied as per D/L method. 

I searched all games for every defending champions from here. Spain's lose against Netherlands is the biggest lose for any reigning world champion in terms of goals difference (1-5). The second big lose is by West Germany who lost to France (3-6) 1958 world cup. It was a match for the third place. And it was the biggest lose in terms of goals against. 

So it is fully permitted to wear inner gloves for batsmen too. You can also search for such equipment on Google. 

I didn't find any source or article where it is mentioned. But I find it by reading scoreboards of ODI matches one by one from starting. The first 50 overs ODI was West Indies v Pakistan, ODI no. 41, played at Albion Sports Complex, Albion, Guyana in 16 March 1977. Note that earlier in ODI format, the number of overs was not fixed. You can see scoreboard of each ODI match by year here. 

This is a mannequin for skill training. Is it used in football/soccer training to increase precision penalty (so is called (slave) defensive template barrier) In american football and basketball is often easy to find it called as man defensive mannequin. I do not know if it exists a "real" name for it, but those are probably the easy denomination you can find for it i.e. commercial links basketball and soccer 

Here the updated wikipedia pages with the list It is interesting to notice that for Nadal this 2017 Roland Garros represents his personal career record for percentage of game won on game losts (116 GW vs only 35 GL => 76.8%) 

If does it exists, how is regulated the invasion of lane in swimming? It is allowed to "invade" the next lane during the stroke under water? 

The most important feature are: a wide lateral vision (so bigger curved lens than normal glasses) and an excellent grip on the head. I can suggest deformable plastic linked to an elastic to wear perfectly (only if you feel comfortable with it). These featuresare not so prevalent because the athletes usually wear contact lenses. Here you can find info on sportglasses (not only for volleyball) and also a commercial link with a lot of example. Those two example with no elastic and elastic solutions to understand better. 

Dhanuka Pathirana scores 277 in a Lancashire's Saddleworth League. The match seems played in 2007 seems Austerlands - Droylsden (366-3) another source - another source 

This is the Olympic Schedule planning of RIO 2016. As you can see there are also other sports like Weightlifting / Taekwondo / Shooting / Judo planned in a single day. I think this is because of structure and techincal reason planning. 

This is definitely different for every sport, so I think it is hard to make a general statement. So, I will attempt to answer the question from the point-of-view of fantasy football and the NFL. There is evidence to show that it actually hurts ticket sales. In 2012, the NFL will require that teams show fantasy statistics at all stadiums. The belief is that fans are staying home to keep track of their fantasy football teams instead of buying tickets and attending games. Since ticket sales have been on the decline* for the past 5 years or so and subscriptions to services like NFL Red Zone and NFL Ticket are on the increase, it would stand to reason that the increase in popularity does not necessarily mean an increase in ticket sales. While this may be good for the NFL, it is not good for the individual clubs. It is worth noting that this impacts the NFL harder than other sports due to the fact that at least 50% of their games are played at 1:00PM ET on Sundays. So, if you are attending a game, you are likely missing out on the majority of other games going on that week. The impact may not be nearly as severe with fantasy baseball or fantasy basketball. *: warning- article is dated 2010, but the 2011 data was skewed due to the lockout and the 2012 data is not yet available 

While team captains have been elected by their clubs throughout the history of football, the team captain was only an official part of the NFL starting in 2007. Their role on the field is not anything more than representing the team during the coin toss. If they are on the field during a penalty, they are typically the one who communicates with the referee about accepting or declining the penalty, but this is not always so. In the NFL, each team elects a captain (either by vote of the players or appointed by the coaching staff) from the offense, defense and special teams based on leadership on and off the field. In the NCAA, most schools have three team captains but this varies from school to school and the responsibilities of the captain are the same as in the NFL. During special event games such as the Super Bowl or a BCS Bowl, schools will often bring in former players or VIP's from the school to serve as honorary team captains. 

During the Olympic Games in curling it is easy to see two stopwatches (one per team) with a time that starts from 38 minutes each . What happens if the time should end for a team? Has this situation ever occurred? 

The group all-around competition speciality involves the use of more than one ball (here a video of WC 2012). In individual competition each athlete use one rubber ball, while during the group there are more balls on the floor area. 

The medal should support under the chest muscles, so normally the lenght should be around 60/70cm - (23/28 inches) Those elements normally are indipendent from the athlete's height because I think they are setted before knowing the order of arrival The reply was base on the following images 

If I understand well this is the case of Rule 18-5. According to this rule the player must replace his ball back to its original position so on the green. (See related FAQ under Rule 19) The other player must play his ball as it lies. There is no penalty to either player in either match play or stroke play. In stroke play only, if the player's ball lay on the putting green prior to the stroke, he would incur a penalty of two strokes. 

This is one of the most controversial boxing matches in history. Some argue that the Alì's punch has not knocked out his opponent, but currently there are no concrete information about it. On wikipedia there is an dedicated page with many info and many hypothesis on this match (also on the possibility that was fixed). So, I think it is not possible to provide a concrete answer to these questions 

Yesterday (August 18th 2016) Gatlin has touched his mate out of those takeover zone From IAAF rule book rule 170.7 

So all matches scheduled for more than two days' and allowing four innings (two innings each) are considered as First-class cricket matches. This also include Test matches (i.e. international) as well. List A 

So a single hat-trick means taking a wicket off each of three consecutive deliveries. So if a bowler takes six wickets in six consecutive deliveries, it will be considered as two [different] hat-tricks. There is no special name for this since no one has achieved this feat but we may say it double hat-trick. However if a bowler takes four wickets in four consecutive deliveries it is called as four in four but the term double hat-trick has also been used in the media*. So there is no special term for that. Everyone refer them in their own term. * taken from Wikipedia 

Edit: (As suggested by @Sports Fan) ICC announce such playing conditions before the tournament is started. See this report in thehindu.com. 

Update: Looking at this post it is clear that the ODI format of 50 overs per side came in practice from 1979/80 in Australia with colored cloths and day\night match. From that season most teams started following 50-overs format except England which continued playing 55-overs ODI at home until 1995. However, England also started playing 50-overs match at home from 1996 v India. From that 50-overs format remained in ODI. 

This is up to the level of the ball tempering and the match referee. Usually the opposite team is awarded 5 penalty runs, the player is banned for few matches, is fined the match fee. There was a big controversy of a ball tampering in the match between England and Pakistan in August 2006. ruled that the Pakistani team had been involved in ball tampering. They awarded 5 runs penalty to England and the ball was replaced. However, Pakistani team denied it and refused to play after tea. After waiting for few time, the umpires awarded the match to England.

What: if you are talking about "Super Tie-break" the appendix V of ITF rules of tennis you can see info about Match tie-breaks (10 points): this is a tie-break to 10 points, a shorter solutions played instead of third (final) set When: suggested by ITF in 2001, experimental in 2002, it becames a rule from the year 2003 source Applied: it is applied also to double matches (men and women) and also in other tournaments out of Gran Slam circuit: ATP 250 men doubles ATP 500 men doubles ATP Master1000 men doubles 

and maybe many more that I do not remember. How does all the stats collected? There are a kind of software that register those info or are collected by human or what else? 

As written on nba website Player Option gives the player the right to extend the length of the contract. Take a look that an unrestricted free agent is able to sign with any team he chooses while a restricted free agent's original team has the chance to keep the player by matching the offer sheet signed with another team. This is known as the "right of first refusal." 

Why there is a lot of difference in cost transfert from football players to a coaches? I think in Europe almost all coaches have an agent, so I do not understand why there is so much difference in the negotiations between a coach (not free) and a footballer For example take a look at Montella sign to AC Milan (where Milan is paying €500,000 to release Montella from his Sampdoria contract) 

During curling matches it is easy to check the percentage for each shot of for each player, but how are those values determined? Each shots can be classified with the following values: 0% - 25% - 50% - 75% - 100% Sometimes it is easy to determine the real value, but how in this case (see the picture): 

There seems to be some debate on where the term started. One common explanation is that it was adapted from the French word l'oeuf (pronounced "luff"), which means egg or zero. In American sports, we often use a similar term of goose egg to refer to a score of zero. The Oxford Dictionary also believes that the term "Love" could have been adapted from the phrase "to play for love [of the game]". Meaning that, if you have no score then you must be playing for the love of the game because you are obviously not very good. 

It is my assumption that the "waiver wire" that is referred to by Adam Schefter and other NFL writers is just their term for the communication that happens between NFL and the NFLPA, et al. Which is to say, the communication from the NFL that the player has been cut. So, if the Indianapolis Colts have already filed the appropriate paperwork with Peyton Manning and the appropriate league offices, the latest that he should be available to be contacted by other teams would be tomorrow at noon. 

Recently during the USA Track and Field Olympic trials, there was a tie for third place between Allyson Felix and Jenebah Tarmoh. It appears that there was previously no tiebreaker rule in place for the Olympic trials, so they were given the option of either competing in a head to head race or having a coin flip to determine the winner. (And who knows what would happen if they tied again) What is the rule for tiebreaks during the actual Olympic races? 

So, it appears that the spirit of the rule is not to prevent movement before the snap of the ball, but to prevent the offensive players from simulating the snap. This, to me, largely seems like a judgement call on behalf of the officials but it is pretty obvious that when the whole offensive line turns around to look at the sideline that they are not attempting to simulate a snap. I'm assuming that the spirit of the rule is the same in the NFL as referenced by corsiKa's answer.
