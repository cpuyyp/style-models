This is an opinion question. But this is my take on it. I have bar-end shifters on our tandem, brifters on my race and commuter bikes, and downtube shifters on a training bike. They are all extremely reliable. The bar-end shifters that I have are indexed, but they can be adjusted to run in a 'friction mode'. That is handy for swapping rear-wheels around with different cassette sizes--no worries about indexing and cog pitch/etc.... And that's the main advantage of levers over brifters... flexibility. If you have a mechanical problem... even a wal-mart bike rear will probably be enough to get you to a LBS for real-help... or if the bike shop doesn't have many parts, you can get going with whatever they have laying around. This is because you can 'disable' the indexing feature... which is not possible on brifters (or any index-only system like ratchet or grip shift systems) Also, the brifters physically stick out quite a ways and if you drop your bike or it falls over... they tend to take the worst impact of the fall... and if they do break, you can't shift without stopping to move the chain/derailer and may lose more than 50% of your braking ability. Sorta' bad if you are out in the woods or unsupported and 100's of miles from help. This is not as much of an issue with downtube or bar-end shifters and even worst case... you'll only lose the brake or the shifter--not both. Bit of a 'eggs in one basket' sort of situation (e.g. all the rear controls in one place, and all the front controls in another) I would say that in my experience there is MORE maintenance required of the shift levers (Bar end and downtube) and less on the brifters. This is because the friction adjustments need a little tweek at the beginning of winter and spring for me. But that may just be my preference. (There's this exact slap motion I can do to go exactly 1 cog--and it aggravates me when the bike doesn't behave) Once a brifter is setup, you may only need to adjust the RD stops for things like wheel changes or cassette swaps, but like any shifting mechanism--that is not always required if the cogs are in the same place with the same pitch. I enjoy the brifters more when I'm fatigued and don't have to reach down to shift... I also shift more with brifters than I do with bar-end or downtube setups. I think it is because it is so easy/quick in relation to the other systems. 

If you can take this to a shop, get them to put it on a stand and show you how the gears should work after they adjust them. 

I would not try to change to disc brakes. The Late, Great Sheldon Brown did write an article on braking, and it covers things better than I could: SheldonBrown's Braking Article You may want to try a different compound on your existing brake. I have had good luck with KOOL STOP dual compound pads in the past, but shimano makes some good ones too. Don't use generic brands, they don't stop as well. Also, degrease the rim, it looks dirty in your pictures. If you 'must have a rear disc', the best path forward is to swap to a disc-frame and get a new rear wheel/hub. Assists are very 'invasive' to the whole bike design, so an upgrade that impacts the assist is usually more economical to implement by changing the entire bike. Sometimes, in these cases, the best answer is 'no'. 

Increasing the 'tongue' weight of the trailer (by moving the wheels to the rear, or only loading forward of the trailer wheels) does not increase the stability of the trailer or towing bike (or vehicle). Up to a point, it doesn't matter. This is true for all trailers, bike or auto. Trailers with extra tongue weight are more likely to cause the tire to 'wobble' on the rim about the contact patch. The problem is especially bad in the case of an under inflated or flat tire. (and if you ever have a flat while you are moving... you are riding a flat tire until you stop) During braking operations, a properly designed trailer will push slightly down as it pushes forwards to increase the rear tire's down-force. e.g. the hitch should allow for some small rotation in the Z axis and the hitch, ideally, should be slightly below the trailer's center of gravity (CG). (think of it as pitching down as you stop) Which is much better than trying to lift it off the ground, which would be the case with a negative tongue weight or hitch significantly above the trailer's CG. If the trailer was designed for (or loaded for) a neutral or light tongue weight, it is safer. If the trailer is heavy enough that it could skid the rear wheel during a turn, it should have a braking system or speed should be reduced. 

I would think smaller panniers and maybe a trunk in conjunction with the backpack. Say, ~5 lbs of books in each pannier, and the balance in the backpack (probably the notebooks... as they'll not fit in smaller panniers anyway)... then the lunch in the trunk-- unpack books from panniers into backpack at school and then pop-off the lunch-trunk on separate straps For panniers, something like the nashbar daytrekkers or something similarly inexpensive (less than $50 and easily mended)... The idea with these is that they stay on the bike--empty when the child is away. The trunk can be hard or soft-sided... soft-sided trunks will need rigid lunchboxes, hard-sided not so much... however... soft-sided are easier to throw in the wash to clean when the inevitable spills happen.... or it gets smelly...Also, some lunchboxes could be bungie-ed down, so may not need a trunk... Overall the budget for such an endeavor, for three riders, would be (excluding labor, bikes, lunchboxes, backpacks--all you should already have) at least $25 for a rack, $50 for the daytrekkers, and another $40 for a trunk... that's around $115 per rider... best case.. in reality, I'd expect it to be somewhere closer to $150 per rider... that's about $450 for the three. Keep in mind that you'll need support for the panniers on the racks if you get seatpost style racks as well... to keep the panniers out of the rear wheels. It is also possible to get some 'water proofing' shower cap style covers that will fit the panniers to keep them dry while transiting and while the bike is parked. Fenders should also be considered. Although, some bikes are provided with proper fenders... If the lunchbox can be retained with the daytrekker's provisions, and the rack+fenders are already present... the budget falls to just the cost of the daytrekkers... 

The freewheel is not that expensive for that bike--around $11 + S&H from many online retailers. Your LBS can do the swap for you--just bring them the rear wheel and the replacement Freewheel and expect to pay for about 30 mins of labor. You could also buy a replacement rear wheel that comes with a freewheel... but that would probably be more expensive. Depending on the age of the bike, call the manufacturer--have the model# and serial# handy-- and they may send you one for free or reduced cost--you'll still have to pay the LBS or purchase a Typical Freewheel Removal tool. And here is where to start with Schwinn Tech support The LBS will also usually have a freewheel removal tool for purchase as well. 

You didn't say it was a recumbent, so I'm going to assume it is just a rear-wheel drive version of the trikes we rode before we got a 2-wheeler. So, this is how I stop mine if there is a brake problem or if I can't get my hand up there quickly enough (carrying packages or kiddies) Really simple--I put my foot on the top of the front wheel just behind the front fork (my trike is one in front and two in rear) If you have a fender mounted up front, you may have to press the fender into the wheel from a littler further from the top of the fork and with more of a side-side action. If you have a 2-in front and one in rear setup... it will need fenders for this trick to work... or if the trike's construction allows... put your foot into the rear wheel towards the [trike's equivalent] of the chain-stay. 

The problem I've had in the past with cheap freewheels is that even with standard gearing I could bend the gear teeth. Even inexpensive cassette types don't have this issue. This happened so frequently, I carried a freewheel removal tool with me and when I spotted a DSB in the trash I'd stop and pull the freewheel. It kept me in freewheels for a couple of years until I upgraded. In short, do the swap if you want to. You should not have any extra problems due to this configuration change... although, you may have issues with shifting and RD capacity (but removal of the FD and shortening the chain will address that for $0) Do not worry about freewheel removal nor the chain. Those will be fine. The hubs generally have plenty of material around the threads and those would fail long before the chain broke... unless the chain was defective/damage or worn-out. 15 gear inches is not that terribly low... My tandem has a 20 chainring and a 28 cog... and 700c wheels with 25mm tires... about 18.8 Gear Inches... and we hammer it up hills with 2 people plus a corider (with child--about 50lbs extra for that)... and a 30lb trailer with 50lbs of gear in it..... I would guess this is way more stress than you will generate on your single. Now, the tandem does have a nice freewheel from the early 90's... but you get the idea. (the chain is nothing special either.) 

Like everything else on a bike, there is some maintenance associated with your helmet. The pads are designed to sop-up sweat and not grind the salt into your scalp when it evaporates. (essentially, to keep them dry, you'd need to not sweat...) If you try to keep them dry with head-coverings... you are just spreading the wetness around. Not saying that won't improve your comfort, but it probably won't keep the pads dryer or your helmet cleaner. Giro, one popular helmet maker, recommends cleaning your helmet with a soft cloth, warm water, and mild soap. They also recommend getting a new helmet every 3 years. Although, the last helmet I retired was 10 years old... and that was due to mishandling. Any significant impact to the helmet or any automobile collision would also be reason to replace the helmet. This periodic washing includes the pads and straps. In practice, I rinse mine out after every ride and give the pads a little mash with my thumb to run the water out as best I can. (I sweat a LOT, even in winter). It is usually dry in 2-3 hrs, but I can grab it before then and head out anyway. Occasionally, I'll use the soap, maybe once a month or so... you'll know when to do it. However, sometimes the helmet gets funky... I forget or can't rinse it good enough, or I leave it so that the water can't drain from it... whatever the reason... Once you get to this point you have two choices: 1. Replace the pads (For giro, you can call/email them or go to the LBS/dealer:1-800-456-2355/giro-consumersupport@giro.com) 2. Vinegar-rinse (apple cider vinegar--ACV). I'm sure other mild bactericides will work too, but I keep ACV for other purposes, so it is handy. Then let the pads dry... then do the warm-soapy to get the Vinegar out. (This is what will usually save me...) We have to be careful cleaning helmets as the adhesives and other materials used in their construction are often sensitive to things like degreasers, bleach, and even Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol, also called isopropanol or dimethyl carbinol,alcohol). 

It looks like to me you are using SPD pedals? I've had issue with the plates/springs that engage the cleat making a creaking noise. A quick cleaning with chain oil and applying grease fixes that, repeat annually. Also, if you are having a lot of creaking at the bottom bracket bearing... that needs to be fixed quickly as a failed BB can destroy your frame. 

You may have damaged your spokes. To be sure... you'd need to know how the wheel was built, but I'd bet dimes to dollars that the spoke was not properly supported while the nipple was adjusted and that is where your twist came from (e.g. they are damaged). Were the spokes held to keep them from turning/twisting while the nipples were being tightened? If not, they may have been cold formed to have a twist in them. if they are anything other than steel replace them, one at a time and re-true the wheel. This happens on standard spokes, but as they are round, you don't notice it... bladed spokes force you to build your wheel properly. (as long as you don't have to re-drill or file hubs...) If they are steel, you may be able to 'save them', but do so at your own risk. I'd have never damaged them, but if I did, I'd replace them. However, if they don't shorten/lengthen too much during the process (e.g. the wheel will still go into 'true' before a nipple bottoms out), they'll probably be fine, although you may have asymmetrical tensions in the spokes which may cause the wheel to need continual truing... If the wheel starts to be a problem child... I'd replace all the spokes: To 'save them', you will need to slack the problem spoke(s), e.g. nipple so loose that it will wiggle in the rim--a lot. Remove the twist by twisting in the opposite direction and retention the nipple and true the wheel once all the spokes are 'fixed'. And hold the spoke so it doesn't wind-up or twist during the truing operation. After you are done, they shouldn't twist again. I like bladed spokes on my custom wheels as they look nice and seem to ride smoother than their plan butted bretherin. But, it may all be in my head. 

Short answer: Drop to the 25mm. Your frame cannot support a 28mm tire. Alternatively, get a touring bike. (everyone needs more bikes!) If you are going to be 'loaded', a 28mm may be more likely to 'balloon off' your, most likely, narrow rim in a hard/fast corner than the 25mm. And the wider 28mm may be more likely to shimmy with load. (lots of references from the 'touring crowd' on this phenomenon... here's one $URL$ Personally, I don't think that 28mm would be instantly unstable in your case, but the 25mm would probably impact your overall riding less. However, the 25mm will probably require a much higher pressure than the 28mm would, so you may have to have a special high pressure pump available on your tour while the people running 28mm or 32mm tires won't necessarily need (as for spare tubes... it is possible to get 25/28mm tubes.. although the 28mm-32mm is more common here in our shops). My thoughts are that moving the rear axle lower in the frame will create a 'moment arm' in the rear-dropouts that the frame was not designed to handle... so while you could put some bits of metal in there to space it down, that could cause a failure of the chainstays, seatstays, or the dropout itself. Not saying it is impossible, but I would expect that there would need to be stiffening (e.g. more material added as a brace) in the dropout area... and a new Rear Derailleur mount along with addressing a possible problem with chain-to-chainstay clearance (or lack-thereof) on your specific frame. And, lastly, since you are most-likely a roadie, it'd look funny, even if the adapters are painted to match your bike. For inspiration, see what these guys did to move the rear wheel: XtracycleConversion (not exactly what you wanted to do, I'm aware, but see how they treated the rear-dropouts? they only applied upward force to them and further braced against the stays... your application wouldn't need quite so extravagant bracing, but that's the idea...) This is one of those cases where a steel frame would be easier to modify/brace than a CF one. I can envision how I'd do this, but it'd be an effort on par with just buying a $1500 steel bike (something like a pre-built surly cross-check or their steel road frame) and selling it at the end of the tour. Your alternative of running 25mm tires is very attractive--especially cost-wise. I'm not going to do more than mention that I'd also be concerned with what the handling and ride qualities of the resulting modified bike would be. Changing the steer-tube angle, even a little in relation to the rider's weight can make the bike wander or over-stress steerer/fork. (the steerer/toptube/downtube area is already high-stress for the materials there)
