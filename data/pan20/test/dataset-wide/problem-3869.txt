Nice try, but I don't think this will help with the ISP. I think of the "$X$-derivation" as an unbounded skew-adjoint operator $D$ on $L^2(M)$. When you say "Sobolev space" I suppose you mean to take the domain of $D$, equipped with the square norm $\|f\|^2_2 + \|Df\|^2_2$. I'm not sure what you mean about an infinite order space. Anyway, working on $L^2(M)$ the operator $D$ is $i$ times a self-adjoint operator, so by spectral theory you can go to a multiplication picture in which $D$ becomes multiplication by a purely imaginary function. In this picture you can see that there are lots of invariant subspaces contained in the domain of $D$, i.e., the Sobolev space. 

As pointed out in the comments, the answer to question 1 is "no". More explicitly, if $v$ is any unit vector in $\mathbb{C}^2$ then the map $A \mapsto \langle Av,v\rangle$ is a pure state on $M_2$, and the pure states arising from two vectors are distinct unless one vector is a scalar (of modulus 1) multiple of the other. Find five unit vectors, no two of which are scalar multiples of each other; the resulting pure states are distinct but cannot be linearly independent, since they all live in $M_2^*$ which is four dimensional. The answer to question 2 is also "no". I think of compactness of the pure states as a commutative/finite dimensional phenomenon. A famous theorem of Glimm states that if $A$ is any C*-algebra which has an irreducible representation that contains no compact operators, then the pure states of $A$ are weak* dense in the state space of $A$. (Believe it or not.) There's no obvious topology that would make the set of pure states compact. 

To understand everything in Connes' book you would need expertise in many different fields. My advice would be to browse it and see if anything attracts your interest. Then you can read up on the relevant background for that topic. 

I believe the solution posted to the arXiv on June 17 by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava is correct. 

Since no one noticed, I feel I should point out that OP's actual statement of the theorem is incorrect. It might not be possible to match up the two bases, for instance you could have the sum $\sum 2^{-n}e_n\otimes e_{n+1}$. It's impossible to reindex the two bases to get this in the form $\sum 2^{-n} e_n\otimes f_n$ because there's an element of the second basis that doesn't get paired with any element of the first basis. (There's also the nitpick that he assumed $\omega$ is a unit vector, but that's less interesting.) 

Well, if $M$ has a metric basis $\{b_1, \ldots, b_{n+1}\}$ then the map $$x \mapsto (d(x,b_1), \ldots, d(x,b_{n+1}))$$ is a continuous injection from $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. So, for example, no infinite dimensional Banach space $E$ could have this property for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$: letting $K$ be the closed unit ball of an $n+2$ dimensional subspace of $E$, we restrict to a continuous injection from $K$ into $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, which since $K$ is compact must be a homeomorphism, and I think topologists know that an $n+2$ dimensional ball cannot be homeomorphic to a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. 

Can we find, for every $\epsilon > 0$, an example of the following? $\bullet$ a finite abelian group $G$ $\bullet$ a small subset $T$ of the dual group $\hat{G}$ (meaning $|T| \leq \epsilon |\hat{G}|$) such that for any subset $S$ of $G$, there is a nonzero complex valued function $f$ supported either on $S$ or $S^c$ whose Fourier transform is approximately supported on $T$ (meaning $\|\hat{f} - \hat{f}|_T\|_2 \leq \epsilon \|\hat{f}\|_2$). It seems unlikely, but I don't know any version of the uncertainty principle that would forbid this. 

Well ... yes if $L$ is normal (meaning $LL^* = L^*L$; in particular, if $L$ is self-adjoint). Assuming that $H$ is separable, we have a structure theorem which says that $H$ is isomorphic to the $L^2$ sections of a bundle over $[-\|L\|, \|L\|\]$ whose fibers are Hilbert spaces, in such a way that $L$ goes to multiplication by $x$. The operators that commute with $L$ are then morally just the operators which preserve each fiber, though one has to be a little careful with measurability issues when making this precise. If $L$ is not normal then at least you can say any weak operator limit of polynomials in $L$ commutes with $L$. But I don't know if you can say much more than that in general. 

This may vary depending on the field you work in and what kind of papers you're writing, in addition to your personal style as a mathematician. I mean whether you bother to check the details of a citation probably has a lot to do with how much effort it costs you. In my line of work the citations are usually to other papers within my area of expertise and I do in fact try to look pretty closely at what was done and whether it really gives what I need. But there have been times when I needed something outside my comfort zone and was content to take the word of an expert that so-and-so's theorem did the trick. On the point about propagation of errors, it seems to me that there is a sort of correction mechanism. If a result is being cited incorrectly, eventually it may lead to a contradiction which would then be unraveled by tracing the problem back. Does anyone have any examples of something like this actually happening? Oh, I should add that some portion of my citations are "courtesy" citations along the lines of "so-and-so did something related". I'm afraid to say in cases like these my reading of the cited paper will sometimes have been very superficial. 

You may be looking for the noncommutative Urysohn lemma: if $A$ is a C*-algebra and $p,q \in A^{**}$ are projections, $p \leq q$, with $p$ compact and $q$ open, then there is a positive element $x \in A$ such that $p \leq x \leq q$. It is due to Akemann, The general Stone-Weierstrass problem, J. Funct. Anal. 4 (1969), 277-294. Or just Google "noncommutative Urysohn lemma". 

If the trace on $A$ is multiplicative then I think the answer to the first question is yes. That should be an easy computation. On the other hand, let $p$ be a central projection in $A$ and take $M = pA$ and $N = (1-p)A$. Then $M \otimes_A N = 0$ but the ranks of $M$ and $N$ are $\tau(p)$ and $1 - \tau(p)$, respectively. This suggests that unless $\tau$ is multiplicative (which would force $\tau(p) = 0$ or $1$) the answer to the main question is probably no. I'm not sure how to parse the auxiliary question. My best guess is that you mean to ask whether there exist modules $M$ such that however we realize $M$ as $PM_n(A)$ for $P$ a projection in $M_n(A)$ we find that $tr(P)$ is a multiple of the identity. If so, I suppose the answer is yes, this happens if $M$ is free, but probably not otherwise. But this is kind of a simplistic answer, so probably I have misunderstood the entire question ... 

I'm a little puzzled by the tone of the original question. My personal view is that operator algebras are intrinsically interesting, and if there are good applications to other fields, so much the better ... I think this is a pretty common attitude, probably among people in most areas of pure math. Anyway, I am not the most qualified to describe some of these applications, but here are a few of the main ones. (1) Connes' index theorem for foliated manifolds. For instance see here and here. Connes 1982 Fields medal was awarded in part for his work on foliations. (2) Jones' work connecting von Neumann algebras and geometric topology, which gave rise to a new knot invariant. See here for a nice overview. Jones was awarded the Fields medal in 1990 in part for this work. (3) Mathematical physics. Many connections, some more established and some more conjectural. The KMS theory is surely one of the standouts. (4) An early motivation was the theory of group representations, e.g., J. Dixmier, Anneaux d'operateurs et representations des groups, Seminaire Bourbaki, Vol. 1 (1995), 331-336. (5) As mkreisel mentions, there are applications to the Novikov conjecture. See G. G. Kasparov, Equivariant KK-theory and the Novikov conjecture, Invent. Math. 91 (1977), 147-201. (6) The Kadison-Singer problem originally arose as a problem in operator algebras. It now has connections to many other areas (harmonic analysis, Banach space theory, signal analysis, ...). I'm sure I am forgetting some important ones.
