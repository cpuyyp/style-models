The Codex Manesse of c. 1304-1340 is an illustrated anthology of German poetry written by professional and amateur Minnesang poets and singers. Many are commoners but others are knights and nobles up to kings and Emperor Henry VI. If it was respectable for the highest levels of society to be amateurs presumably professionals would be considered reasonably respectable persons suitable to be present at the courts of kings and nobles instead of vulgar scum. No doubt the high nobility didn't think that commoner minnesangers were their social equals, but I am uncertain how snobbish they were. I get the impression that rigid social stratification and court etiquette was introduced in more modern times. I remember reading somewhere that Albrecht Durer (1471-1528) wrote that his father, goldsmith Albrecht Durer Sr., sometimes met Emperor Fredrick III (1415-1493) in a tavern and was complimented on his skills by the Emperor. 

I don't know. Emperor Frederick II (died 1250) was born 26 December 1194. His mother Constance was born 2 November 1154 and thus was 40 years, 1 month, and 24 days older than her son. It is said that, as was customary, she gave birth with many witnesses to make sure there was no doubt that Frederick was her child. But Frederick's enemies sometimes denied that he was actually not the child of his parents, which was also rather customary, and to make it seem more doubtful they sometimes exaggerated Constance's age, claiming she was 50 or even 60. Eleanor of Castile mentioned by Lars Bosteen apparently lived to be 49 years old. Since she died 28 November 1290 she should have been born between 29 November 1240 and 28 November 1241. Her youngest child, King Edward II of England, was born 25 April 1284, and thus when Eleanor should have been between 42 years, 4 months, and 28 days and 43 years, 4 months, and 27 days old. Eleanor of Castile was a great great granddaughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine also mentioned by Lars Bostten. Eleanor of Aquitaine was allegedly 13 in the spring of 1137, thus being born between about March 21, 1123 and June 21, 1124; and also allegedly turned 14 in 1136, thus being born between January 1, 1122 and December 31, 1122. And she was also allegedly 82 when she died 1 April 1204, thus making her born between 2 April 1121 and 1 April 1122. Thus Eleanor of Aquitaine was probably born between 1 January 1122 and 1 April 1122. Her youngest child, King John was born 27 December 1166, and thus when Eleanor should have been between 44 years, 8 months, and 26 days and 44 years, 11 months, and 26 days old. But if Eleanor was born as late as 21 June 1124 she would be as young as 42 years, 6 months, and 6 days when John was born. Eleanor of Aquitane was a great great granddaughter of Duke William V of Aquitaine. Emperor Henry IV was a grandson of Duke William V of Aquitaine. Emperor Henry IV was the father of Agnes of Waiblingen who was supposedly born sometime between the summer of 1072 and early 1073. We might assume that Agnes was born between about 21 June 1072 and 21 March 1073. Agnes's youngest child by her second marriage was Gertrude, wife of Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia. Gertrude was said to be born about 1118, thus making Agnes about 44 years, 9 months, and 11 days to 46 years, 6 months, and 11 days old when Gertrude was born (if in 1118). But Gertrude is also said to have died age 30 on 8 April 1150, thus being born 9 April 1119 to 8 April 1120, making Agnes about 46 years and 19 months to 47 years, 9 months, and 18 days old when Gertrude was born. Agnes was the great great grandmother of Emperor Frederick II by her first marriage. Maria Dobroniega of Kiev (died 1087) was the wife of Duke Casimir I of Poland. Her father St. Vladimir I, Great Prince of Kiev (c. 958-1015), had many mistresses as a pagan ruler before converting to Christianity. Vladimir's second (but first Christian) wife was Anna (born 13 March 963), daughter of Emperor Romanus II. There is a slight possibility that Maria was the daughter of Anna and Maria's descendants would thus be descended from the Macedonian dynasty of Emperors. If so, Anna would probably have been quite old when Maria was born, since Maria's youngest child was born in 1046 to 1048. Anna married Vladimir in 988, so Maria (if Anna's daughter) could theoretically have been born as early as 989, thus living to be about 98 and being about 57 to 59 when her youngest child was born. Vladimir died 15 July 1015, so Maria could have been born as late as April 1016, making her only about 30 to 32 when her youngest child was born. If Anna was alive in April 21016, she would be about 53 years and one month old, which would make her a very old mother if she had a child then. One source says that Anna died in 1008/11. If she died giving birth to Maria, Anna would have become a mother aged about 45 to 48, and Maria would have become a mother aged about 35 to 40. Another source says Anna died in 1022. Any evidence that Anna was the mother of Maria would be evidence that one or both of them was a mother aged over 40. Duke Albert II of Austria (1298-1358) married Johanna of Pfirt in 1324, They had several children who died young. Their first surviving child, Duke Rudolf IV was born 1 November 1339, their youngest Child, Duke Leopold III, was born 1 November 1351 and Johanna died 15 November 1351. Johanna's father, Count Ulrich III of Pfirt, died in 1324, so theoretically Johanna could have been zero years old when married, 15 when Rudolf IV was born, and 27 when her youngest child Leopold II was born. If Johanna was at least 12 when married she would have been at least 27 when Rudolf IV was born and at least 39 when Leopold III was born. Johanna's birth year is given as 1300, which would make her 50 or 51 when her youngest child was born, though some suspect she was born later. Johanna was a great great great great great great granddaughter of Agnes of Waiblingen. These examples are enough to show that some women did give birth in their forties during the middle ages, and also that it is hard to be certain who was the oldest. 

Apparently the kings of the Spanish kingdoms never included "King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia" among their titles in Spanish documents, but for centuries kings of the Spanish Kingdoms used the title of "King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia" in official documents in one or more other realms that they ruled. I don't know why a monarch would claim Kingdom A in his kingdoms of B and C but not in his Kingdoms of D and E, but that was the case. Of course the kings of Spain claimed so many royal titles it was hard to keep track of them, so maybe the title of "King of Hungary" was simply overlooked by the chanceries in some kingdoms. The website Titles of European Hereditary Rulers lists many titles of the rulers of the various countries in Europe over the centuries. According to the chapter on Spain, there doesn't seem to have been any Spanish monarch who listed the kingdom of Hungary among his titles in documents in Spain itself. For example, Emperor Charles V never used King of Hungary among his titles in documents in his function as King of the Spanish kingdoms. His titles were: 

Most of the titles claimed were places Charles actually ruled, though the Kingdom of Corsica had never actually been ruled by Spanish monarchs and the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Duchies of Athens and Neopatra had been conquered by the Turks. $URL$ But a monarch of different realms can use different titles in different realms. According to the section on Austria, Emperor Charles V's titles as Archduke of Austria from 1519 to 1521 included "King of Hungary", even though at that time Louis II was the king of Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania, and Bulgaria. 

The Lombard kingdom had never been very centralized and usually became less so over time, especially since the Emperors usually spent most of their time outside of Italy. However, Italian rulers sometimes underestimated the power of the Holy Roman Empire and came to regret it. During the War of the Spanish Succession of 1701 to 1714 French armies invaded and occupied northern Italy and many Italian rulers collaborated with them. Then Austrian armies drove the French out of northern Italy and occupied it. Joseph I, emperor of the Romans, (reigned 1705-1711) collected millions of Florins in imperial war tax from northern Italy in 1708, more than from the states in the Kingdom of Germany except for his hereditary domains. Some Italian fiefs were confiscated from their owners for treason. Most famously, the Duchies of Montferrat and Mantua were confiscated from Duke Ferdinand Charles for his treason. 

To clarify the dates a little bit: Prince of Wales George became King George II on 22 June 1727 and his wife Caroline Princess of Wales stopped being Princess of Wales when she became Queen Caroline at the same time. Their son Frederick Lewis was created Prince of Wales on 8 January 1729. He was married om 17 April 1736 thus acquiring a Princess of Wales. Frederick died 31 March 1751 and Princess Augusta was thereafter merely dowager Princess of Wales and not real princess of wales. Frederick's son George was created Prince of Wales 20 April 1751. He became King George III 25 October 1760 and did not marry until 8 September 1761 and thus never had a Princess of Wales. 

$URL$ And there have been many other inheritance customs and rules and many variations on the main systems. 

DVK's question is flawed. Agnatic means through the male line of descent. The present Swedish and British law is called absolute primogeniture, with the eldest child succeeding whether male or female. There is nothing agnatic about absolute primogeniture and it is not some subset of agnatic inheritance. Thus DVK's terminology is flawed. There have been many different customs and rules of royal inheritance, usually similar to or even identical with the customs and rules of property inheritance, through the ages, and those rules have usually been made into law in recent decades and centuries. One large category is primogeniture, in which the first born inherits. 1) Absolute primogeniture is the current rule for royal succession in most of the remaining monarchies in Europe and in the Spanish nobility. The first such law was passed in Sweden in 1980, and by now the only European exceptions seem to be Spain, Monaco, and Lichtenstein. In primogeniture the children and other descendants of the previous monarch have priority over the previous monarch's siblings, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces cousins, etc. In absolute primogeniture the oldest child of the monarch, whether male or female, inherits the throne, or lacking an oldest child, the closest thing to the oldest child of the oldest child, etc. 2) In agnatic primogeniture or patrilineal primogeniture, the inheritance can only go through and to males. Thus brothers, uncles, nephews, cousins, etc. of a monarch would inherit instead of his daughters, female children of his sons, or even male children of his daughters. There have been famous examples of distant male lineage relatives inheriting under this rule when many other persons were more closely related to the dead ruler. When King Henry III of France Was assassinated in 1589, King Henry III of Navarre succeeded as King Henry IV of France - though he had to fight a civil war to do so. Henry IV was related to Henry III in the 23rd degree. If you counted Henry III's and Henry IV's ancestors back to their common male ancestor King Louis IX (died 1270) the total was 23. Louis IX died 319 years before Henry IV inherited. At that time King Henry III had a surviving sister - the childless wife of Henry IV - and his heir by male preference primogeniture was Spanish Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia. When Elector and Duke Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria died in 1777, his closest relative was his sister Maria Antonia Walpurgis (1724-1780), Electress of Saxony. But because of agnatic primogeniture his distant relative Karl Theodore (1724-1799), Elector and Count Palatine of the Rhine, inherited Bavaria. Their latest common agnatic ancestor was Duke Louis II (1229-1294) the Severe of Bavaria, who died 483 years before Karl theodore succeeded to Bavaria. When William III of Nassau (1817-1890) King of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxemburg, died in 1890, his daughter Wilhelmina (1880-1962) became Queen of the Netherlands. But the succession law in the Grand duchy of Luxemburg was agnatic, so his distant cousin Adolphe (1817-1905) Duke of Nassau from 1839-1866, became Grand Duke of Luxemburg. Adolphe was his 17th cousin once removed, allegedly the most distant relative to ever inherit a throne. Their latest common agnatic ancestor was Count Henry II (c. 1190-1251) the Rich of Nassau, who died 639 years before Adolphe inherited. 3) Male-reference primogeniture or cognatic primogeniture was probably the most common succession rule in the middle ages. That meant that a ruler's descendants were preferred to those of his siblings or more distant relatives and that brothers were preferred to sisters. But if a ruler had no surviving sons or sons of his sons, his daughters, or his son's daughters, or his daughter's children, would be preferred to his siblings or more distant relatives, even the male ones. This became the most common rule of succession in Europe in the Middle Ages and Modern Era. In England the first two Queen Regnants were Jane and Mary I in 1553, but as early as 1135 the two rival claimants to the English throne were King Henry I's daughter Matilda and his sister Adela's son Stephen. Richard Duke of York claimed the English throne in 1460 by descent through two Women. In Scotland in 1284 King Alexander III (1241-1286) made the nobles swear to recognize his granddaughter Margaret (1283-1290) the Maid of Norway (daughter of Queen Margaret [1261-1283] of Norway) his heir if he had no other children in the future. And after Margaret died all the many competitors for the Scottish crown except one claimed it through one or more women. By coincidence, 19th century Spain and Portugal both had succession wars between uncles claiming agnatic primogeniture and their nieces claiming male-preference primogeniture. 4) Uterine primogeniture. Under this system the oldest son of the nearest female relative inherits. Thus a monarch would usually be succeeded by his oldest sister's son. It has been claimed that the Picts in early medieval Scotland practiced that form of royal succession. Some tribes and kingdoms in Africa follow uterine primogeniture. 5) matrilineal primogeniture or female-preference uterine primogeniture. This is the mirror image of agnatic primogeniture. The throne is suppose to pass from female to female, to the oldest daughter of the oldest daughter of the oldest daughter. The Modjadi or Rain Queen of the Balobedu people in South Africa has that succession law. 6) I guess the opposite of male-preference primogeniture would be female-preference primogeniture when the oldest daughter of a queen would normally inherit, but a male could inherit if he didn't have any sisters. Non primogeniture succession. There were plenty of succession rules, customs, and laws that did not involve primogeniture. 7) Agnatic seniority is the system used by Saudi Arabia. the oldest male in the family is usually the next heir. Thus all the Saudi Arabian kings for 65 years since 1952 have been brothers and half brothers, sons of the founding king ibn Saud. Most of the kings had adult sons of their own that were passed over in favor of their older uncles. 8) the Rota system is the modern name for the succession rule in Kievan Rus. There were a number of principalities ruled by princes under the Grand Prince. When the grand Prince of Kiev died some other prince had to move to Kiev to become Grand Prince and there was a reshuffling of principalities among surviving princes, presumably in the order of seniority. There were of course a number of civil wars fought about succession. The Princes modified the rota system in a conference in 1097. The princes got to keep some lands as patrimonial lands outside the rota system. One patrimonial land, the principality of Moscow, was the core of the Moskovite state and of modern Russia, expanding as the rota system gradually faded away. A similar system was used in Poland from 1138, and in Movavia and Bohemia from 1055 to 1182 and 1203. 9) The royal succession method in the Gaelic lands of Ireland and Scotland was complicated. Membership of the dynasty was limited to male lineage males, as in agnatic primogeniture. But instead of hereditary succession from father to son, every adult male closely enough related to the king was a potential successor. The group of dynasts was often limited to the adult sons, grandsons, and great grandsons of a previous king. The eligible dynasts elected a Tanist as the heir to the throne. When the king died the tanist succeeded him and the dynasts elected a new tanist. Sometimes a king's son was the tanist, sometimes a brother, or nephew, or uncle, or first cousin, or remoter cousin. The tanist system enduring in Ireland for about a thousand years from the dawn of Irish history to the 16th century when Irish kings surrendered their kingdoms to the English Kingdom of Ireland and received them back as noble fiefs descending by primogeniture. King Malcolm III of Scotland (reigned 1005-1034 challenged the tanist system by choosing his maternal grandson Duncan I (c. 1001-1040) as his tanist, and the descendants of Duncan's son Malcolm III (c.1031-1093) managed to make the throne hereditary by male-preference primogeniture. 10) Welsh land inheritance rules were that land was divided equally among all the sons, legitimate or illegitimate, of the deceased. Welsh royal inheritance involved one son inheriting the kingdom and his brothers usually inheriting regions to rule as sub kings or lords under his authority. A Welsh king was supposed to be the son of a previous king but not necessarily the immediate previous king, thus kings were usually sons, or brothers, uncles, nephews, or cousins of the immediate previous king. 11) Patrilineal ultimogeniture. Inheritance by the youngest son.
