Catholicism became the state religion of France again in 1803 re-established by Napoleon following the French Revolution starting in 1789. Since the OP asked about Europe, specifically: I didn't check every nation in Europe, but I assume that Switzerland is likely to have the earliest and freest laws governing religion. Complete religious toleration was granted in 1874 but separation of church and state was rejected in 1980 by ballot initiative. Here is a good paper on the development of the role of religion in Europe. Religious toleration seems to have been common in Latin America by this time. 

Enclosure is one of the causes of the British Agricultural Revolution, but it causes mass unemployment. The unemployed people often sought work for low wages in the Industrializing Northern England. British Agricultural Revolution 

One example is the Russian population in Kazakhstan. (The USSR transferred large populations around, so this is probably not the only example.) Settlement started in the 19th century, but increased in the 20th century. According to Wikipedia, by 1917, 30% of the population was Russian. 

The North combated these problems in a few ways: First, they disenfranchised everyone who fought for the Confederacy and disallowed them from holding any political office, such as police chief. Later a "loyalty oath" was introduced, but most refused to take it. Politics at this time was a very closed profession. Old families held political positions for generations. This made the Klan lack official political power, which was true before martial law. Freed blacks became a much more powerful political force when all the former politicians could no longer hold office and many learned about politics during this time period. The Freedmens Bureaus provided help in voting to freed slaves. Second, elected judges were removed and replaced with military tribunals. Klansmen who killed someone trying to vote or run for office would not evade justice because their actions were popular. Most "law enforcement" against them was done in most states by black militias with the support of Republican governments, which could be strong or weak support. Republican governments in Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas and North Carolina were the most effective, although none were highly effective. North Carolina governor, Holden, was the first to attempt to combat the Klan after the murder of a black man, "Chicken" Stephens. This sparked the event known as the "Kirk-Holden War." Martial law was declared in the countries where the klan was most active and the state militia was used to suppress the violence. Over 100 arrests were made, but as the actions were unpopular and lacking federal support, all of the suspects were released. In Tennessee where the Klan originated, the state militia was called out to suppress the Klan. The members went into hiding and no arrests were made, but the violence stopped temporarily. Texas governor, Edmund Davis, conducted the most successful effort to end Klan violence. His militias made over a 1000 were indicted and this put down the Klan and paramilitary groups for a number of years. Some were given fines and 65 were given federal prison sentences. In the end though, the Klan put down Governor Davis. Re-elected in 1873, the paramilitary group, the Travis Rifles, opposed his election. He barricaded himself inside the state house protected by the black militia, but without federal support gave in to their demands and resigned. In other states, especially Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, the power of white supremacy paramilitary forces was much stronger. Although state militias were sometimes called out, they were also sometimes completely routed and beaten militarily. Most governors feared using a state militia composed almost entirely of black troops in case it would cause a race war. Fearing a military defeat and race war, the governor of South Carolina decided not to even attempt to fight the Red Shirts, the active group in the state. Instead, in South Carolina, using the Third Force Act, the Union army cracked down on the Klan in the up country and one trial was held in Columbia after a few hundred were indicted (formally charged with a crime), while two thousand are believed to have fled the state. There were only a few convictions. The trial did tamp down on much of the worse violence, though. Using U.S. Marshalls and the US Army, the Department of Justice under the direction of Amos T. Akerman managed to secure 600 conviction throughout the South in 1871. 

Firstly, I think you may be getting a little confused between life peers and hereditary peers. Life peers are given a peerage or title for their lifetime only. It is not hereditary and it cannot be handed down to their children. When that person dies, the peerage or title dies with them. They are not expected to maintain a country estate or multiple houses, nor are they necessarily expected to be wealthy. The cost you refer to I believe is probably constituted from an honour fee paid, for the priviledge of becoming a peer which probably covers the administrative charges, charge for the warrant and possibly also the fee for a coat of arms or heraldry from the College of Heralds. In addition to that would also be the cost of regalia when needed and worn on public occasions. The cost of all that added up could well constitute a considerable sum of money. Hereditary peers are in a similar position but the initial cost of being made one will already have been paid and their main concern is the upkeep of the family seat or family home which would have been passed down to them through the generations. Many peers have found that these old country homes and castles are simply so expensive to maintain they've had to sell them to English Heritage, who maintain them but open them to the public. Some have had to sell them to private individuals simply because they have insufficient funds to maintain them. Just because a country seat has been sold, does not mean a hereditary peerage or titles goes with it. It does not, it remains with the peer until death and is then inherited by their son or sometimes daughter. 

Abolishing serfdom is important for creating a middle class. An very early and well developed legal system protecting personal and property rights First European Nation State Henry VII wins the War of the Roses in England, begins the Tudor dynasty in 1485. Financial innovation The UK did not invent many of these things, but its strong legal system allowed them to flourish, such as contracts, equity, mortgages, joint stock and limited liability. Private companies were able to use joint stock with the permission of the monarchy to finance trade and settlements in British colonies. An example is the British East India Company.

I believe there is common confusion that Hitler's antisemitism developed later because the Freikorps were not antisemitic originally. 

This is 63 cents/day. The RDEU was considered NOT appropriate for long time use, since it was nutritionally insufficient. The WPA set these guidelines to attempt to help families budget as economically as possible. The figure of $1,260.62 was set as the minimum for a family of "small means" to purchases only proper food housing and clothing, but not cars, tractors, better housing or save for their children's education. National Income Distribution and Poverty Rates According to Michael B. Katz and Mark J. Stern in Poverty in Twentieth-Century America, through the usage of a reconstruction of early poverty data proposals, the level is lower: 

They would have learned Latin and Greek and learned the classical structures for writing speeches, such as Eulogy or Apologia. The Gettysburg Address is an example of a Eulogy. Attitudes Towards the Audience The most important difference is the way the creators of books, speeches and historical accounts view the people that will read it. According to Dominic Strinati in "An Introduction to Theories of Popular Culture" there are three ways to divide art by its audience: folk art, high art and popular culture. In the late 19th century, art movements started to address art to be created for the "peasants" or the "volk." The early 20th century included many disputes about mass media creating low brow mass culture. Today, more or less popular culture has been victorious. A major reason is that mass media markets expanded in the 20th century and we are continuously exposed and normalized to pop culture messages, but it is also simply a cultural shift. Writers are encouraged to keep communications simple and understandable to everyone in society, unless a book or communication is absolutely directed for a small number of experts. Political speeches are no longer flowery or use complex grammar, because it is considered more important that everyone understands and participates in the democratic process. Letters are largely not written at all and have been replaced by email, text messaging, instant messaging, or even picture messaging. The "goodness" of a writer is now measured by how well they communicate a message (so much so de Toqueville is being called a bad writer!?). During the Civil War, writers would have been much more concerned with the style of their writing. Style can also be used to communicate messages. 

Wiki Source It was just another contributing factor that led up to the French Revolution so it's worth researching the causes of that as well. Ironic that France in trying to weaken her old enemy Britain actually contributed to the downfall of her own monarchy. 

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the term originates from the Tudor period of Henry the VIII whose emblem of the House of Tudor was the red rose. This excerpt from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) does indeed point to it: 

Did the North's population outnumber the South, or merely have more men available to be conscripted into the army to fight? The answer to this question is less about industrialisation and more about the availability of qualified men able to be conscripted into the army to fight. The southern states had a totally different economy to the north and was based primarily on slave labour. This slave labour, consisting mostly of African-American (is that the correct term?) descent were not available to join the army and fight. It's true the confederate Army did enlist some slaves towards the end of the war, but at the beginning the Confederate Army consisted mostly of non-slaves. This is the reason for the larger Union Armies compared to the Confederate ones. 

I believe the answer you're looking for is a direct result of the Industrial Revolution which occurred between 1750-1850, exactly the correct time frame for the time period you're referring to. This allowed enterprising entrepreneurs to harness the technological advances in production machinery to both produce more for less and new mass produced items that were previously unavailable. The result of this was a new class of businessman who became very wealthy. This clearly elevated them above the 'manual workers' but still below the already well established aristocracy whose wealth came from more traditional means but most generally was inherited wealth. So you now have three established classes. 

Propaganda is an invention of the 20th century. It is the application of behavioral psychology and modern linguistic philosophy that saw rhetoric more widely intentionally applied to other symbols than only language, such as posters, movies, and newspapers. Propaganda was widely used during WWI to improve morale at home and target enemy morale. This is from the seminal work on the subject. "Propaganda", Edward Bernays, 1912 

Licensing In order to practice medicine in the US, you must have a license as well as a MD. To obtain this, doctors take examinations on a regular basis to prove their medical knowledge, known as the United States Medical Licensing Examination. Licensing dates to as far back as the 1890s. 

The Romans did still use formal logic in rhetoric but not at all to the same degree as the Greeks had. They no longer believed it could uncover the truth through debate, so this emphasis was lost. 

The question is leading, so I will address a few parts separately and I apologize for the length: The Middle Ages is the period from 400-1400 AD. The occupation choices of Jews changed dramatically during this 1,000 year period, especially around the 7th century. The question also asks about the time period from 1300-1700 AD. During 1300-1700, only 5-10% of European Jews were farmers, the main occupation of the time period. It's not clear exactly how many European Jews were engaged in finance, but over 50% is possible. A higher percent seems economically impossible, even if all occupation choices were closed except finance as became the case by 1700, since Jews were restricted to ghettos and had separate micro-economies. They had separate schools, religious leaders, scholars, doctors, merchants, and food service providers. Almost all Jews were farmers in the first half of the first millennium, whereas at the end of the first millennium a small proportion of them remained in agriculture and the greatest majority became craftsmen, artisans, merchants, doctors, and moneylenders. A shift is also seen away from craftsmen, merchants and artisans towards a greater proportion of money-lenders over time. I will propose a few reasons for this. The negative stereotype of Jews in finance is that they are tight-fisted or greedy. Shylock is after his "pound of flesh." Usury was forbidden to Christians, so people of the era viewed the occupation as sinful and evil due to their religion. There are dozens of instances of Jewish laws regulating ethical financial behavior. The Wikipedia article states the theory that Jews chose the occupation of finance and money-lending due to restrictions in other occupations. This is likely only partially correct. Oliver Cromwell introduced the first blanket occupational restrictions on Jews anywhere in Europe in the 17th century, but Jews were well-established in finance by this time. The restrictions were a political move to convince Parliament to allow Jews to re-enter the country after their expulsion in the 13th century, since he was seeking help from Jewish bankers. It was common for them to be excluded from guilds, so they might not be able to be craftsmen or artisans. The Jewish Virtual Library says that Christians often complained that Jews were overly aggressive and did not follow the business etiquette of the times, so their business practices were sometimes regulated or they might be banned from some areas of business entirely. Another widely accepted theory for the large numbers of Jews in finance is a change in religious education that increased literacy rates during the Talmudic era. According to this theory, Jews changed from a primarily agricultural people to primarily urban people engaged in trade, finance, commerce and medicine at roughly the same time, around 7th century, in different areas throughout the world, despite varied treatment in occupation restrictions. It is also shown that Jews that remained farmers tended to convert to Islam or Christianity at much higher rates than urban Jews, while effective laws were passed to prevent conversion of Christians to Jews starting in the 5th century. According to Botticini and Eckstein: "The transition away from agriculture into crafts, trade, and moneylending started in the Talmudic period, especially in Babylon. The Babylonian Talmud (redacted in about 500 CE) has many more debates and rulings regarding crafts and trade than the Talmud of the Land of Israel. In the fifth—sixth centuries the Jews abandoning agriculture moved to the towns and became small shopkeepers and artisans in the tanning, linen, silk, dyeing industries, and glassware making" In Babylon, its known that two banks were established by Jews as well. So also during the Talmudic Period, finance was an established occupation but small. Finance was well-established as a Jewish profession by 1170 as documented by the travels of Benjamin of Tudela and the laws of Talmud. Persecution of the Jews worsened over time, so it reasons that laws restricting occupations for instance became more frequent and more restrictive with effects on occupational choices. At the beginning of the Middle Ages, the Jews were viewed as the "Chosen People" by Christians, so although popular sentiment was often against them, Catholic Church leaders protected their rights. The Crusades hardened attitudes and the establishment of universities in the 13th century led to Christian scholars examining Jewish holy texts. Church leaders decided the Talmud was a heresy within their purview to regulate. This turbulent time period of persecution coincides with the rise of powerful European financial centers, such as Venice in the 14th century, through the work of Jewish bankers. The Jewish Emancipation started in the late 18th century and ended in the late 20th century. Although Jews are still over-represented in the field of finance, it is not as pronounced as it once was.

No he wasn't. He abdicated of his own free will choosing Wallis Simpson over the throne. He abdicated because as a British Monarch he was the nominal head of the Church of England that did not allow divorcees to remarry. The Church strongly disapproved of Edward's intention to marry a divorcee in Wallis Simpson. He was also viewed as a bit of playboy and held fairly naive views on Hitler's Germany which also didn't sit well with the English government. This doesn't mean they forced him to abdicate, but given they didn't view him as a particularly strong minded potential Monarch, they didn't help him either. 

I agree with point 1 on the third answer - it was because of the kick on the musket that would send the ball too high if aimed horizontally. By pointing the musket down slightly from horizontal the kick on the musket would bring the ball slightly higher than horizontal which with falling trajectory would have a much better chance of hitting 'a target' in a group of men. Let's not forget here that smooth wall (non rifled) muskets of the type used early on in the Civil War were notoriously inaccurate when fired from any kind of range. From close range their inaccuracy didn't matter, from longer range it was more a question of luck whether you hit anything. 

I can tell you two things, how many were under Nelson's fleet in the Mediterranean and how many were in commission throughout the world in May 1804. Under Nelson's command were 13 Ships of the Line, 1 Fifty, 11 Frigates, 10 Sloops, 3 Bombs, 6 Gunboats and 2 Cutter and Schooners. In total commission (throughout the world) were 88 Ships of the Line, 13 Fifties, 125 Frigates, 92 Sloops, 18 Bombs, 40 Gunbrigs, 6 Gunboats and 82 Cutter and Schooners and 41 Armed ships.

Interpretations of cultural and artistic art forms are also rhetoric and designed for mass audiences, but are not "applied" rhetorics. Marxist definitions of rhetoric and propaganda will include this though. 

Writing styles from this time period thus appear much more "poetic" in nature, but it was soon replaced by Realism. Much of modern writing is probably properly called Utilitarian. It is also Postmodern and many American writers still rely heavily on Realism, even in more creative writing forms. Education Classical education ended in the 1960s. One of the main reasons is that the sciences and "social sciences" became much more important. You are correct that Americans in the Civil War who were educated, which is a much smaller percent than today, would have had a much stronger background in literature. 

The pact replaced Germany's long running relationship with China before WWII. Germany originally felt closer to China when it opposed the terms of the Versaille Treaty giving Germany protectorates in China to Japan. China's civil war ended in 1949, but communism was a growing force in the country in the 1930's and the weakening of China's nationalist government translated into a gulf between China and Nazi Germany. So instead Hitler sought an alliance with Japan, which had also been undergoing ideological changes, who he saw it had more ideological similarity now. I don't believe racism was an important reason or other ideological reasons. Japanese ideology, often referred to as "Japanese fascism" in the past was quite different in many ways. The most important way is that it was not a workers movement, as it was in Germany. It was instituted by the elite in Japan to "improve" and speed up capitalism and industrialization through the monopoly control of industry. Here is a good article.
