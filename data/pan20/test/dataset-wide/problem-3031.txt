The local historian tells me that the southern part of the Alps front was held by 1st Airborne Task Force, which landed in Dragoon, until November 1944. The northern part of the Alps border seems to have been held by French units that landed in or after Dragoon. Since the local historian doesn't deal with the area, and the only book on the subject is in French, some detective work is required. The top-level French unit in the area was 1st Army, which commanded 1st Army Corps and 2nd Army Corps. The corps pages give us the names of some of the divisions that served in the corps, and at this point I resorted to French Wikipedia, which naturally has more detail. I can't read French, but the numbers tell me enough to figure out which pages to run through Google Translate. And that tells me that 2nd Moroccan Infantry Division fought on the north of the Alps front, liberating two towns near the Italian border on 14th October 1944. After that it was transferred north. Part of 4th Moroccan Infantry Division seems to have assisted with that, but was transferred north by the end of November. Most of the work from November onwards seems to have been done by French units formed from local resistance fighters, who would need some serious training before they could fight formed German units, but were experienced in scouting, sniping, and general harassment. In March 1945, 1st Free French Division came south from Germany and attacked over the Alps into Italy, as part of finishing off the Italian Campaign. Troops the local historian talked to were not happy about this, seeing it as a punishment. 

Given the impending landfall of Hurricane Sandy I wondered what was the first established emergency management agency akin to the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency? 

Your question seems focused on the intent behind the passage of a particular law. The difficulty with the "intent" of a law is how do you define it? Often times laws are passed and nowhere does it say "this law is passed for the specific purpose of doing X, or preventing Y." Even in situations where there is a passage in the law that says "this law's intent is to combat Z," that may not be trustworthy because the politicians that draft such language know that a court will look to that passage for the "intent." And, as society changes at what point do you no longer consider the intent of a law? For example, think of the "Jim Crow laws" in the US. The intent of a law is rarely concrete, but what is concrete (basically) is the letter of the law. Now even a textualist like Antonin Scalia will try to figure out the intent if the letter of the law leads to an absurd result. The point is that the intent of the law often looks clear to one person, but many times another person can marshal an equally strong argument that the intent is different in some way, so then you are left with the question of who wins. Furthermore, you cited one case which definitely looks absurd on its face, but is not necessarily representative of the entire US legal system. 

If there were Allied spies in Berlin during the war, they would have been seeking information of more immediate value. The CROWCASS lists were not finished until 1947, so there would have been plenty of time to use German records after the war. One source that may have contributed was the card-index at Bletchley Park. That indexed every name, place, ship, and anything else mentioned in any decoded German signal: those decodes were what was called "Ultra" intelligence. Given the name of a concentration camp, for example, it was easy to look up everyone who'd ever been associated with it in a signal. Source: Station X, by Michael Smith. 

Arthur Zimmerman appears to have been trying to avoid being blamed by the German press and politicians for bringing the USA into the war. Placing your personal interests ahead of those of your country when you're a government minister is rarely a good idea. He said: 

Well, the potential for using time to measure longitude was certainly understood by Hipparchus in the second century BC. He proposed that longitudes of distant places could be calculated by measuring the local solar time of lunar eclipses, which are visible over half the Earth's surface. However, the available means of timekeeping weren't sufficiently accurate for this to be useful. 

I know that "The Great Game" was originally concerned with Russian-British competition in Central Asia, but my question is was this competition and British fear founded on anything? My understanding of Russian history at this point leads me to believe that the Tsarist empire was not in a position to try and undertake such a massive task. Perhaps I am mistaken about this, but I would like to see evidence supporting, or disproving, the British concerns. 

Professor Fisher notes that prohibition was essentially forced upon the large cities of the East Coast by the rest of the country. The Anti-Saloon League is cited as a particularly effective organization that saw prohibition through to its ultimate success. It is also interesting to note, as the Howard McBain (a law professor at Columbia University) did in 1928, the sheer amount of popular support for prohibition: 

Just to expand on MichaelF's answer, the House began to debate the increasing size of Congress after the 1910 census. There was worry that the House was becoming unwieldy, but as Representative Edgar Crumpacker stated: 

Some time after the unification of China by Qin, Ren Xiao and Zhao Tuo were sent to colonise the barbarian region of Nanyue around present day Guangzhou. Zhao Tuo succeeded Ren Xiao around the time when revolts began to occur against Qin, eventually signalling Nanyue's independence by declaring himself King and raiding surrounding provinces. When Liu Bang reunited China, the diplomat Lu Jia persuaded Zhao Tuo to submit to Han, although he retained his title of King. However, after Liu Bang's death, his widow Empress Lü cut off trade in iron goods with Nanyue, as a result of which Zhao Tuo declared himself Emperor of Nanyue, dispatching troops to attack Han and sending bribes to nearby chiefs to encourage them to switch allegiances. Empress Lü sent troops to attack him but disease led to the failure of the mission. After Empress Lü's death, Emperor Wen took the throne. Once more, Lu Jia persuaded Zhao Tuo to submit to Han, renouncing his title of Emperor and returning to being King. 

Ramming survived as a tactic for use against submarines much longer than for use against surface vessels. The reason for this is that submarines are fairly fragile, and any significant leakage makes them unable to submerge - or at least, to surface again after submerging. During WWI, the main anti-submarine weapons for most of the war were ramming (see the HMS Dreadnaught example) and gunfire, which was mostly ineffective against submarines at periscope depth and impossible if they were deeper. Depth charges took some time to develop, and for navies to make provision to carry enough of them. During WWII, ramming was sometimes used by convoy escorts if a submarine came to the surface close by, as a finishing move. Some escort commanders objected to it, since a destroyer that rammed usually needed to be docked for repairs to the bows afterwards. Ramming is also used on occasion as an attack of desperation. When a smaller ship finds itself fighting a larger and more powerful one, and its weapons aren't effective, ramming is worthwhile if you have no realistic hope of escape, or if it's very important that the enemy is damaged That was the case for the HMS Glowworm example. 

Those conquered by Liu Bang prior to the defeat of Xiang Yu were from similar cultural backgrounds. The fact that Xiang Yu could reasonably think that he was surrounded by soldiers from Chu singing Chu songs indicates that Liu Bang did not practice forced assimilation, or at least had no reputation for doing so. After the unification of the empire, Liu Bang was generally too busy killing off his old generals to do much conquering of different cultures. The only contact with foreign subjects that I'm aware of was with the southern and eastern Yue, both under peaceful circumstances. In both cases, local leaders were allowed to continue on as Kings (in the case of eastern Yue, this entailed a change in title from Chieftain) with a great deal of autonomy.

What I would interpret from this is that while a number of people may have made suggestions on Octavian's new title, he was the one who really decided upon it and the Senate vote would have been pretty much a formality. Cassius Dio does not record how the Senate voted on the matter, although it would be odd for there to have been any voices of dissent when they were not present on the more significant matter of granting him his powers. There is also no record of who suggested the name in the first place or who put the motion up in the Senate. I would consider Agrippa to be an unlikely candidate for the latter given that Octavian would not have lacked sycophants who could have done so instead and having his closest ally make the proposal would not have been in keeping with his habit of making honours look as though they were voluntarily bestowed by a grateful Senate rather than actively sought. 

Another example: The 102nd Cavalry Regiment of the US Army was re-organised during WWII, to form the 102nd Cavalry Group (Mechanized). This fulfils the OP requirement of the men still being "cavalrymen." 

Stalin was working with premises that seem odd to us As others have said, in the Soviet view, the US/UK and Nazi Germany were not that different. They were enemies of Communism, and it seemed natural to Stalin that they would ally against the USSR. Also, while Stalin's and Hitler's forms of dictatorship don't seem very different to us, to both Stalin and Hitler, they were opposites. Stalin's preferred strategy up to the Nazi invasion of the USSR was for the western powers and the Axis to wear each other down as much as possible. The USSR would chose its moment to enter the war, and dominate Europe afterwards. This strategy conformed to Marxist-Leninist ideas about the inevitable course of history; Stalin's lack of immediate response to the invasion may have been partly due to shock that the impossible had happened. US/UK fears of a separate peace The Soviet pre-invasion strategy wasn't exactly secret, because it was so obvious. After the invasion, the US and UK fully expected the USSR to collapse, just as the Nazi leadership did. It wasn't until late 1941 that it became clear a collapse wasn't going to happen, and even then, some people expected it in 1942. It wasn't until after Stalingrad that it was clear that Germany couldn't defeat the USSR with the means it had. Even then, there were fears that Stalin would make a peace that restored his 1941 borders. If he did that, he could revert to his pre-war strategy, allowing the US/UK and Germany to inflict losses on each other, and then stepping in at the right moment. There had been several sets of contacts, offering Germany progressively worse terms, but Hitler was never interested - he saw the USSR as his fundamental enemy. Stalin's fears of a separate peace It always seemed logical to him that the US/UK would combine against Germany, and that they would be fools not to do it soon. Hitler's hopes for a separate peace The drowning man clings to straws... He was never interested in peace with the USSR, but hoped for the US/UK to join him against Stalin. Never going to happen. They'd made up their minds that Germany would have to be remade, to avoid all this happening again in a few decades. The Japanese kept trying to get Hitler and Stalin to make peace Addendum: The Japanese were at no point keen on going to war with the USSR. They'd tried that in 1932-39 and weren't interested in trying again, hence their neutrality pact. They wanted Germany and the USSR to be at peace, so that they could access German industrial production via the Trans-Siberian Railroad. To this end, they kept offering to mediate between the sides, having diplomatic relations with both of them. Now, this was never going to get anywhere, because Hitler was absolutely set on destroying the USSR. The fact that the Japanese kept trying illustrates what a lose and uncoordinated alliance the Axis was - Germany and Japan weren't honest with each other about their war aims - and how little they understood Hitler. But the fact that they kept trying would have leaked, and created uncertainty for the Western Allies about Stalin's intentions.

So, yes, deceased voters contributed to LBJ's victory because they put him ahead in the final vote count, however, LBJ's lawyers ability to prevail in the ensuing litigation led to LBJ's election. As Daniel puts it "[t]he lawyering of the two teams did not produce any jurisprudential landmark. The significance for LBJ, however, was enormous; but for the legal victory, he would not have become U.S. Senator and then Vice President and President." 

The economic effects of the Cuban Revolution were somewhat of a mixed bag, and depending on the timeline you are interested in the immediate impact was negative, whereas on a longer timeline it was more positive. The following paraphrases, and quotes relevant parts from Jose Pérez's work Cuba: Between Reform & Revolution 

The Cuban economy would at first shun sugar and tobacco production as they were seen as relics of the country's colonial past. This led to a huge rise in Cuba's trade deficit, mostly with the USSR and Soviet Bloc nations. Cuba would go back to tobacco and sugar in 1965 out of need. The dismal state of the economy was not good, but as Pérez points out there were some positive outcomes eventually: 

Restricting this to those who served for at least 6 years between 1937 and 1947 (excluding 1948 because Caro attributes LBJ's increased activity then as being necessary to support his Senate bid), which of LBJ's fellow Representatives were less active than him in terms of legislation proposed per year and House participation? Was this inactivity consistent throughout their careers? 

In the first book of Robert Caro's series on Lyndon Johnson, The Path to Power, he observes that in his time as a member of the House of Representatives, LBJ had introduced only 5 bills of national consequence (only one of which he actively pursued and none of which became law), that he made only 10 speeches in the House until 1948 when tactical considerations for his Senate bid required otherwise, that he barely participated in asking questions and making points of order, and that he was careful also to avoid supporting one side or the other even in private conversation. Caro concludes that:
