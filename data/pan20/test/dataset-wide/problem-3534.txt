As for avoiding broken capillaries, you could avoid exercising, but this would probably not be satisfactory for you. Instead, try to see if your bruise areas are the result of any contact during exercise. If so, can you eliminate that contact? Are you changing temperatures suddenly (e.g. going from air conditioning to hot and humid outdoor conditions)? The article I gave is a good starting point to get you thinking. 

I am a long time distance runner turned amateur triathlete who has had a long time achilles tendon problem in both legs. I first injured my achilles in college about 15 years ago, and since that time the injury has flared up on and off. In recent years I switched to triathlon training because it allowed for hard training every day while laying off the achilles completely (while swimming), or partially (while cycling). To get to my question, I was wondering if anyone knows of a strength training program which can build up the calves in such a way that running won't aggevate the achilles, or at least will aggrevate it less? Currently the only thing I do is standing one-legged calf raises, once per week, with a little added weight. But I am open to doing much more work if it could help my problem. FYI the reason I want to do this is because I only run at most every other day now due to the achilles problem. But I have my eye on maybe doing a standard traithlon or a half marathon at some point, both of which would require much more running mileage than I am currently doing. 

Smoking can definitely be the cause of your erectile dysfunction problems. Nicotine, which is found in cigarettes, is a vasoconstrictor, which is a type of drug that causes your blood vessels to shrink. When a male erection is forming, the blood vessels inside the penis need to widen so they can become gorged with blood. Smoking too many cigarettes could potentially interfere with this. If cigarettes are the cause of your problem, you could try quitting. You could also try taking a drug like Viagra of Cialis. 

I'm a complete newb, so wondering if anyone could give me a more general way to warm up. Like, you start with empty bar, then add how much, how many times, until you reach the target? And also, do you do this for just the first squat exercise, or do you warm up similarly for the 2 exercises coming after that as well? And if so, should you start with the empty bar each time? Or? Just looking for easier, more general rules I can follow as I'm a total beginner and the examples in the book was a bit too specific for me to be able to pull something general from them. 

Should I? Or will it ruin things for SL? If it's not a problem, when should I do it? Inbetween the SL days or same day? Before or after? 

I'm just curious if there is a general pattern of where fat is taken when it is spent during exercise. Is it taken more or less equally from all fat in the body, are some areas used more than others, is one area "depleted" before moving to the next? Also, is it consistent with where fat is built up when stored? So if I gain x amount of fat and then burn x amount of fat, will my body "look the same"? (I know it is probably a lot more complicated, but just looking for some general surface lines of what's going on out of curiosity) 

I have started to try out the StrongLifts 5x5 program. Started a week ago. But, I have a rowing machine at home that I'd like to keep using. So, what I'm wondering is 

Say I have done some exercise and the next few days I am rather sore in certain muscles. What is the best thing to do about that? Let them rest (avoid using them)? Use them a lot? Exercise more? Rub them? Hot bath? 

In relation to eating, when should I not exercise? Or rather, are there times that are better or worse than others to exercise during the day? For example, is it better or worse to exercise in the morning? If you do it in the morning, should you do it before or after you eat? Should you wait for a while between you eat and exercise? Or at night, is it better or worse to exercise before you go to bed? Is it better or worse to do it before or after supper? Maybe not the clearest question, but hopefully someone understand what I'm asking about. Basically, during a day, when taking sleeping and eating into account, when is it preferable to exercise or not to exercise? 

Among elite runners, the mileage loads and base training doesn't differ that much between the 5K, 10K, and half marathon distances (q.v. Marty Liquori's Real Running). That being said, in the case of a beginner runner I would use the following rule of thumb. If you cannot comfortably complete the distance at tempo pace, then you probably should not attempt to complete it on racing day. If you step out of your body's comfort zone while also going at race pace, you could get injured. And I agree with what haa already been said that you should listen to your body. 

The consensus is that there is no best time to workout, but rather that the best time is the one which will allow you to be committed to your training program. The reason for this is that exercising consistently gives long term benefits which outweigh the difference between a morning and evening workout. Your preference for morning versus evening training will depend in part on your body's circadian rhythm, which is something like your body's own metabolic clock. If you feel lethargic and out of energy when you wake up then you probably won't want to go on a 10K run in the middle of winter. To answer your question, if you feel exhausted after leaving the office, then your body may be telling you to train in the morning. Perhaps you can find time during lunch for a workout? There are some differences between a morning and evening workout. Working out hard late in the evening can cause insomnia. Normally in the late evening your brain increases its production of melatonin, and your body's metabolism slows down. This is all supposed to get you ready to sleep, but a hard workout can prevent this. I can personally attest that late night workouts can cause big insomnia. And I have paid the price for this many times, as I often had to wake up early the next morning to train again. There is an excellent article on BodyBuilding.com which compares many exercise parameters during morning, noon, and evening. Other sources: American Heart Association WebMD
