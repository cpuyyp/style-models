Traditional English-speaking Christians made this question their first entry in the "Westminster Shorter Catechism", a kind of standard guide to Christian thinking: Q: What is the chief end of man? A: Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forever. 

I don't think a typical theist says that they define rationality differently than a New Atheist. Instead, I see that P does indeed have evidence, although it is either evidence not acknowledged by NA or unavailable to NA. Defining rationality differently is asking for trouble. I would call that a bad plan by P. The form of P's evidence could be any of the following: A) Personal witness of supernatural events, such as a divine messenger or answer to prayer. B) Acknowledgement of the intended outcome to the moral argument, "watchmaker argument", ontological argument, Kalam cosmological argument, etc. ...for the existence of God. None of these arguments are irrational on the face of it, although possibly NA could demonstrate that with effort. C) Reception of historical accounts and letters which testify to supernatural events attributable to God. On the face of it, it is not more irrational to believe the Bible than it is to believe the sayings and writings of Richard Dawkins or Chris Hitchens.

Killing a person in self-defense is the subject of "stand your ground" laws that have not failed constitutional scrutiny as of this writing (spring 2018). So American legal scholars find ethical grounds for this form of killing, when a person saw the dead person as a threat, completely in absence of a proper evaluation by a judge, jury, policeman, etc. Another way of talking about this ethical situation has been named "trolley problem", in reference to a popular thought problem: 

Neither choice seems OK, but especially not if you don't accept claims by Abrahamic believers in "The I Am" about the nature of God as the sole originator of both physical and moral reality. If gods really are just human contraptions, then this dilemma feels like a paradox and thus anticipates the naturalistic fallacy without expressing it as such. 

I would define nature as that which is repeatable and explainable without resorting to unexplainable things. An apple falling is natural, since no part of that is unexplained by natural causes: the biological apple and the physical principle of gravity, which in turn have explainable causes: biological plant life, physics of mass / astrophysics / gravity. But I would assert that a person is not natural, partly on account of the originality (unpredictability) of our actions. The way we use the words "artificial", "un-natural", "fake", etc. bears out this assertion. 

The most talked-about self sacrifice in religion is the death of Jesus. The anonymous Biblical letter "to the Hebrews" offers this explanation of the motivation of Jesus: (note that "the cross" refers to the agonizing form of capital punishment by which the Romans killed Jesus) 

Jean-Paul Sartre made the following notion famous in his play Huis Clos (No Exit): "Hell is other people!" ( link ) Jesus said a similar thing: "I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings." ( Luke 16:9 NIV ) Whether your human interactions are trivial or non-trivial is a major matter of dispute, and worth your serious reflection. 

Strangely enough, I would argue against the right to have a child on account of the fact that it can only happen with two, not one. I don't see that there is a class of rights that is applied to couples, and it would be a disaster to entitle individuals to procreation. Nevertheless, I think it is probably wrong for an authority to abolish procreation for any person or class of person... but not because "procreation" is a right. Maybe the right that individuals have is "the pursuit of procreation", to borrow an expression from the writers of the US Declaration of Independence. 

So according to Kant, Judas avoided the guilt of lying. But I'm not convinced that Kant would acquit Judas... after all, he was not obligated to get up from dinner, walk across town, and make an arrangement with the Pharisees as to how they could find Jesus. In contrast, Jesus didn't "tell the truth" under questioning, but he was truthful in all declarations, as required by Kant. There should therefore be no trouble applying Kant's ethics to the subject paradoxes... just don't answer the question. Die first, but don't answer the question.

Any philosopher who might have mentioned his/her thoughts about it? The linked article above was written in 2017 by Jonathan Jenkins Ichikawa and Matthias Steup. Jonathan Jenkins Ichikawa is a young philosopher who studies and teaches philosophy of language (as well as epistemology and philosophy of mind), at University of British Columbia in Vancouver. He once told me that his job was to think about knowledge. Matthias Steup works in epistemology and other philosophical fields over at University of Colorado in Boulder. According to his personnel webpage at UC Boulder: 

You can't objectively report facts about matters that only have meaning subjectively, and "what is the capital of Israel?" is a great example of this. Political authority can be defined ideally, practically, or in retrospect... and in stable situations, these are all aligned. But when governments are in dispute, sentences like "Tel Aviv is the capital of the nation of Israel" cannot be objective, since "the capital" is defined subjectively. It would be factual to report that "the US government sometimes claims that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel", or that "other authorities claim that Tel Aviv is the capital of Israel" since "X claims Y" is clearly falsifiable. What is the true capital of Israel? Maybe we won't know until this political era has already passed. Ideally, some Jews probably believe that it truly is Jerusalem, as it was long ago. Practically, there's probably little actual governing control coming from Jerusalem, so you could say "of course it's Tel Aviv." But in retrospect, later, historians could look at the way things played out and use proper definitions and third-party objectivity to say what it really was. Maybe it's really somewhere else in all truth, if that's where the governing power is really located! EDIT: The falsifiability standard for objective reporting may also be achieved by community-based reporting. StackExchange is actually a good example of this: if someone "reports" something that just ain't right, it doesn't get promoted. But if something gets lots and lots of votes, you know that the reporting has some objective merit, at least for more people than one. Thus, "there was an earthquake last night at 9:32 PM" or "the Warriors won the first game of their series against the Rockets" could be reported and confirmed to be reliable if it is not disputed by other witnesses. 

Thinking about your argument, I think you would do well to focus on the questions of "how do we know?" and "what gives us the right?" EDIT: Also, you said that you tried to show why capital punishment may not be effective. Effectiveness, too, is something you must fully define and explain in order for your argument to hold. Effective at what? It's not an easy question, and there isn't consensus. But you still may persuade people by virtue of thinking ahead, having a good answer to all the common objections, and focusing on basic principles that people do already agree with--- showing that your solution is the best way to go with those principles. As a matter of taste, I will add my own advice: use the right word. It's OK to use an unusual word if it works really well, but don't use a word that you need to define for people unless it is a really good idea to do so. Also, I like to use words like "good", "bad", "try", "want", and "hope", instead of "beneficial", "detrimental", "attempt", "desire", and "intentionality" because it's just easier to understand what I'm saying that way. If people need to you to define "good" for them, that's OK, but I don't start by assuming that. Good luck! 

So by this rule, given the choice, it is more ethical to choose self-death than to endanger another person. 

1: Here is a set of all the sets that don't contain themselves. 2: This set doesn't contain itself, by definition. 3: Therefore, this set must contain itself, by definition. ABSURD! 

I'm not sure what the strong arguments in favor of conscious Turing machines are, but I'm aware of at least two reasons people deny it! ...the technical limitation of simulating (specifically) the human brain, and the mind-body problem. The mind-body problem has all the appropriate literature, so I will not attempt to repeat this, except to say that whatever a Turing machine could do, is done by "body". In my capacity as a mechanical engineer, I have from time to time used commercial software that implements computation to simulate physical systems, such as finite element analysis of the stress at each element of a bracket or axle (etc) resulting from applied forces. The computer writes equations at each element with the goal of solving for an equality and uses iterative methods to arrive at a solution, since empirical solutions (as with differential equation solutions) are so rarely practical. Even so, the solution is fraught with interpretation, as when an internal 90-degree corner has a singularity in stress, the mathematical result of "stress concentrations." If memory serves, a typical analysis that I performed a few years ago involved about 200,000 elements and my 2005-era computer could finish it in less than an hour. Using Moore's law and guessing that a transistor increases computation speed linearly, a computer today could do the same thing in between 1 second and 60 seconds. Increasing the number of elements (or "degrees of freedom") is desirable because it increases the precision of the output, but at an exponentially increasing computer cost, as demonstrated here. What would be necessary to simulate the human brain? The human brain has 85-86 billion neurons. If we take "Computational Time for Forward Elimination Steps of Naive Gaussian Elimination on a Square Matrix" as a reference, reasonably there is about an increase by 10 ^ 10 in computation time for each ten-fold increase in the number of elements in our computation, so when we add six factors of 10 to my 200,000-element computation, we need sixty factors of ten for the computation time. However, my physical system computes elements that are only related to four or six nearby elements. Each neuron has on average approximately 7,000 synaptic connections. At a minimum, this can be multiplied by my element count for this purpose (of guesstimating a reasonable minimum computation time to simulate brain activity) so we need another thirty factors of ten on top of our computation. My computation was linear, in that a given input in force causes a proportional response in stress, deflection, etc. Neurons are non-linear, so we must somehow account for this increase in computation time due to complexity. My computation was static, meaning that time-dependent aspects of the computation weren't part of the equation. Neuron activity is highly time-dependent (see this again). Without addressing non-linearity and time-dependent issues, a brain computation would reasonably take a computer today between 1 and 60 seconds multiplied by ten to the ninetieth power. To reduce the computation time back to under a minute, Moore's law would need to work for the next 660 years. My computation was for a single input and a single output. The human brain is constantly receiving inputs and producing outputs at an unknown or (more likely) stochastic rate. If this were 100 per second, then that tacks easily ten more years on our Moore's law estimate, placing a working brain simulation nicely in the year 2780. Nobody believes that Moore's law will actually continue working for the next 670 years. Will quantum computers save the day? Google's quantum computer is 100,000,000 times faster. But this only shaves 8 factors of ten off of our 90, resulting in only 82 factors of ten for the brain computation and 550 years for Moore's law to work: computer brains by 2570. 

According to the definition of free will that attaches it to responsibility, praise, and error... a simple proof that free will exists would be to observe the existence of any of the following: Praise Responsibility Error 

The account of Pliny the Younger of the eruption of Vesuvius at Pompeii shows various people's actions under extreme duress, how some people were praying to gods (or otherwise expressing supernaturalist faith) and others simply weren't. I think that philosophers like Plato may have been less likely to believe in the gods, given the power of their arguments: for example, the Euthyphro dilemma is a powerful argument against the moral argument for gods under polytheism. 

I suppose that misanthropy could be tied together with "the problem of evil", which has been addressed by philosophers in various ways. By the way, I perceive misanthropy to be highly self-contradictory, since you can't hate everybody unless you hate everybody...and what was it you thought was so bad about them? Their kindness? 

One way to prevent many of these at the same time is for one man and one woman to bond permanently and to keep sex just within that pair. People also frequently feel that this is not just a good way, but the right way. Messing it up will damage this relationship as well as any other relationship that depends on that bond and that protection. Restoring the relationship requires forgiveness. At the same time, people who sell things may take advantage of this effect on a person's brain and offer some form of sex (such as pornography) for a price. Society doesn't let children make binding contracts, and society doesn't let children grant consent to sex. This is because of the imbalance between the risks and sex's attractiveness, which society doesn't expect children adequately to comprehend. Also, that's why society has accepted limits and restrictions on what adult merchants can provide for non-adults.
