On the other hand we may wonder what are the side effects of taking supplementary protein , assuming the guaranteed quality of the product. I will draw your attention to this study published at July 2013 and examined the side effects of this supplement on so many different aspects. This paper answers following questions 

First rule, STOP your workout exactly when injury happened and DO NOT continue the session. In the coming weeks, don't leave the injured muscle/joint isolated due to the injury. The trick is not to directly work it directly, but to work around it. 

I was going through this article in the benefits of rest-pause exercise and seen this recommendation which I need a bit of help to interpret. 

DOMS If you come back to the same muscle group - say, biceps - ** it can be the sign that you may still haven't recovered from your last biceps session**; in other words if your biceps are still sore or sensitive for pushing and pulling, this could mean you need more rest period and you may need to look for the symptoms above to confirm that you're over training. There are lot of debates about the word over training. I am just using it in terms of "not rested enough for the load of training you've done." What happens if... Training before recovery isn't that constructive. If you are familiar with the muscle building process, in very simple words, you injure the muscle and you feed him properly during recovery then it recovers in a better shape. Hence if you keep injuring the muscle without letting him to recover, you're not doing great PLUS you increase the risk of long-term injury. What do to If that's the case, you should either give your muscle group more time to rest or boost the recovery by taking supplements and foods which help you in this case. The keyword to do some research for this would be recovery and BCAA (Branched Chain Amino Acid) . References 1)Penney, Stacey, and NASM CES. "Overtraining–When There Isn’t Enough Time to Recover." UPDATE I have stumbled upon this article called The Myth of Overtraning by Vince Del Monte the other day in my IroMan Magazine newsfeed and thought this definitely needs to be here since it's extremely informative. 

No. Fat is stored energy and is not relevant to the body section or organ it is stored on. Your body's metabolic system will pull the stored energy from wherever it wants to when it needs the excess energy. Many people do report that fat loss occurs in the order of first on, last off ..however this is purely anecdotal and not scientific 

It's irrelevant what you used to do. You may have some head start with weight lifting but if you haven't lifted in a while , you probably lost a nice amount of strength. Either way pick a beginner weight lifting program like starting strength or 5x5 stronglifts and it will help you progress properly and safely. It will help you choose your starting weight also. There is no need to do a full body workout at this stage You don't need any supplements. If you don't get in enough nutrients you can take a multivitamin 

For the person who is doing a resistance training with a spot on diet with all the meals weighed and protein and Carb proportions balanced, can grains be the main source of complex carbs, if weight loss is the goal? I always noticed the recommend complex carbs for people in this situation are brown rice, pumpkin, sweet potato and similar foods. However I've came across this paragraph in one my readings which says "The current Paleo craze has demonized grains, which isn’t fair, or rooted in solid science. Still, most people get and stay leaner when they limit their intake. This is partly due to grains being readily available and easy to overeat. A wise move is to save your grains for just one meal a day, either at breakfast, in the hours before or after you lift weights, or as part of your last meal of the day." Does this mean grains such as wholemeal bread can be problematic and hindering the weight loss process if used as the main carbohydrates source in the daily diet? 

Often enough a foam roller can accomplish what stretching cannot. I would recommend you add that into your routine 

High intensity interval training and weight lifting are both very good protocols for insulin resistant people. Studies that point to weight lifting increasing insulin sensitivity $URL$ $URL$ HIIT effect on insulin resistance study $URL$ You can search around as there are a lot more, i just quoted a few As with all studies the only way to know if they are really true is to try them out (where there is no risk) and see for yourself 

Obviously you will be limited to bodyweight exercises. I would try to get in some basics bodyweight resistance training and some plyometric style cardio as it will help with the explosive power of your muscles. There are plenty of portable equipment options too for relatively cheap should you choose to invest such as bands which generally come with a door catch so you can work both push and pull muscles 

As you'll find out reading the answers for these questions specially regards to adverse effects of protein supplements on Kidney, the results are evaluated as inconclusive. Assuming the trustworthiness of the paper and hoping it's not bypassed or secretively funded by a supplement company I was relieved that not any significant/major side effect found in this level on a healthy adult. Reference> Health effects of protein intake in healthy adults: a systematic literature review 

In more details: As soon as you feel something out of the ordinary happened and your instincts are telling you that this is not a normal pain which happens during lifting, stop what ever you you are in your plan are and go home to give the injury the attention it needs. No more reps no more sets. Some people say, I just started the workout and I don't want to leave it halfways and this costs them at best some injury which drags for a long time and at worst a permanent one. So indirect and controlled (lower than normal weights and intesity), multi-joint moves will be good for the injured part to bring him back to the normal state. I have dealt with couple of fairly serious injuries including knee and wrists and these techniques ,advised by the specialist I consulted with, worked the best. Good luck 

Your body should be the one giving you feedback. How is your body responding is the question you need to ask yourself and not just afterwards rather while you are running If you end up feeling overly stressed or ill than you probably want to tone it down. 

I would go to either a person certified in sports medicine or someone who coaches physique athletes as they would both have a pretty good idea ability how to properly analyze your situation and provide good treating 

This has nothing to do with the formula based upon heart rate , it's the way it works even when you are not exercising. Every single part of your body from your organs to your muscles requires energy to survive. That is what your basal metabolic rate is based upon. The more of you there is, the more energy is necessary to keep you a float. When you are exerting yourself more than just existing like walking or standing even sitting you need to expend more energy to support that. The amount of energy necessary once again goes up if there is more of you. The formula of calculating calories based upon heart rate is simply a way of correlating hr to energy output (FYI it's not a highly accurate formula). So naturally the same principles will apply to the formula that it will assume your output is more if you weigh more 

Scenario So if you're a person who goes to gym after finishing from work and possibly finishing the gym session by 9 or even later and need to be in bed by 10:30 to be able to have the minimum amount of recomended sleep, this feeding time can be extrememly complicated. Since I think lots of people fall into this catagory I felt the need to verify following facts in more details: Questions 

How to know Well, since our friends looking at the problem in a very "sports science way" I will rephrase and add more details (which may not be as practical as you think. Please refer to an expirienced trainer to be the judge of the symptoms below (Self judgments can be too soft and over sensitive sometimes)) 

This is an extremely complicated move you got it mind and it depends how is your current physical fitness and strength level is. Handstand press needs so many factors such as great balance, the ability of standing body weight by different muscle group (proportional muscle strength) and a lot of skill factor. For the first matter, balance, you need to start from practicing this move besides the wall. As the ability of standing your body weight and lifting it up which comes to your actual question, shoulder and upper body strength matters a lot. You can work on them by adding chin-ups, shoulder presses, and push-ups to your workout. Skill!! needs practice, practice, practice. There are great resources online to give you the gist such as How to Work up to a Handstand Push Up which gives you the step by step idea and lots of Youtube videos such as video from KinoYoga Youtube channel. 

There is nothing specific which will cause you to lose weight. Being in a caloric deficit will do that. Amy exercise that helps you lose weight is simply because it puts you in a caloric deficit meaning you are burning more calories than you are taking in. Is 15 minutes of any exercise really enough to put you in a major deficit that would cause significant weight loss ? Probablyy not 

I do 5x5 and IF and have no problem with recovery. If you are concerned with fatigue and CNS recovery than the answer really is it depends on how well your body recovers and how you feel. This will obviously be impacted by the type of workout you do also. So try it and see what happens. There is no right answer. If you're feeling fine and you are just concerned with muscle synthesis , there are some studies that have been done by Layne Norton to show optimal muscles synthesis takes place every 4 hrs and there is benefit in consuming protein every 4 hrs or so. However this is just a few studies not hundreds of studies, it's not set in stone and even if the conclusions are true they only claim a slight benefit nothing more . you will still make gains without it. You need to weigh out the before of IF to you over the slight improvement in muscle synthesis. If IF is what's keeping you in your diet ,it's way more important than these minute benefits 

This might seem too good to be true but I had the same feeling when I read this point in the researched trusted article. As far as I know, the best form and the most correct style of getting up from lied down to stand up position is how a child who just-learned-to-get-up does. Most of the physical reactions and posture figures in the babies aren't biased by the modern life and bad habits yet and our instincts apparently does the best. I would suggest Googling this video and checking some of them to get the exact idea. Meanwhile I will try to find the source of the article I have read this at and attach it to this answer for the added value of the answer. The article below cannot be referred as a reference but worth checking. It highlights some good points. Babies can do it, but most adults can’t 

Those symptoms usually come from electrolyte loss. I agree sport drinks aren't the best for replenishment. There are many supplements which will accurately replace electrolytes list in the proper proportions.I'd recommend the one from the company saltstick 

To answer which one burns more calories, that's pretty straightforward math. Steady state cardio burns calories based upon intensity level x amount of calories per minute . In order to get that number you would need to know your heart rate during exercise and either have the hr monitor calculate the calories burnt totals for you or plug it in to a online calculator. Either way it's pretty simple. Sounds like the treadmill option is more intense and is burning more per minute however if you are doing it for less time you might be burning more with walking outside. My advice,Collect the data and run the numbers. Once you have clear which one is burning more, that still doesn't answer the question of which one is the better deal. The best exercise for you is the one you will stick to , only you can answer that question 

I am totally aware of the health benefits of having moderate amount of salt (Sodium) in a balanced diet and also down sides of having too much. However, I can see that, in so many healthy cooking recipes they mention to use low salt, no added salt and similar sorts ingredients to use for cooking. 

The lower your body fat, the faster you fatigue and also quicker you feel stressed. don't take me wrong on this comment Fat is a very slow release source of energy and when the protein source gets depleted in your body, the system kicks in to burn fat as a fuel to keep it up. This is the main reason for the fatigue. Even in strength training having a reasonable amount of fat (Not over, Not under) will keep your joints from being damaged unless you deliberately draining your body from fat for a competition. During this period, you should watch out for the good form and controlled weight to prevent injury.1 This point comes into action in most of heavy weight lifting sports and joints are padded and lubricated by fair amount of stored fat. (and possibly can be a positive). However those athletes benefit from a very strong cardiovascular system and having that extra weight won't be phrased exactly as being "overweight". Excessive fat can be the cause of lot of problems in the body and a good starting point for most issues. "Conclusion A lower daily fat intake and lower percentage of total energy from fat were associated with increased injury risk among competitive female runners. Lower energy intake and lower energy availability approached, but did not reach, a significant association with overuse injury in this study. By documenting these risk factors, it is hoped that future research will continue to investigate their role in injury development, thus leading to better strategies to predict and reduce running injuries in women."1 Additional resources for self-read: Eating Habits That Reduce Injury Risk LESS FAT IN DIET LINKED TO INJURY RISK IN RUNNERS 1)Gerlach, Kristen E., et al.
