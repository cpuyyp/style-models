Given the time, Mark Twain probably still used the original spelling, but with the new meaning, so what he wrote means: 

House, Aristotle’s Poetics, p 96 Kermode, The Sense of an Ending: Studies in the Theory of Fiction, p 18 

Googling some phrases from this mostly returns blogs and other sites which repeat this verbatim. Two books seem to be of interest: 

I'll need to see if Moncrieff actually stole one of Dickens's works before Nickleby, but it seems probable. The quote in the question, though, does not seem to be directly about Mr Crummles, but is said to one of the guests at his farewell dinner (bold mine): 

This sort of writing is not unusual in itself*, but I don't think the previous 7 books had many, if any, instances of it, whereas Toll the Hounds has multiple such instances - and I am not even halfway through it! Personally I find such sections tedious, making the entire book far more hard reading than the others. Is there a noticeable change in Erikson's writing style in this book? If so, what triggered it? Has he talked about it somewhere? 

Prof. Barbara Hochman, in an essay on The Great Gatsby, feels that it is telling that the solstices are mentioned both at the beginning and the "climactic midpoint" of the novel. Her analysis of the book is interesting, you might want to read it. 

This strongly reminds me of The Long Earth series by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter. I distinctly remember a passage about the main character, Joshua Valiente, which matches the quoted passage comparing him with Daniel Boone. In this series, there's a device called a Stepper which lets humans step between parallel Earths. Checking Wikipedia, it seems the series originated in a short story, The High Meggas (The device is a belt in this story.) Looking at the Long Earth Wikia's plot description for that story, it seems there is a female character who turned out to be the villain: 

I don't know the context, but presumably the character being talked about doesn't talk much and the speaker doesn't like that and wants to make him leave the ranch. 

I would say that though the Blue Ajah are more consistently "good" than other Ajahs, but the WoT balances prominence between the Blue and Green Ajahs: 

I know that Charles Dickens changed the ending to Great Expectations after prompting. Did he do so with any of his other books? Of course, he may have changed the endings of all his books a hundred times before publishing. However, I'm looking for alternate endings that have also been published. 

According to the Wikipedia article, this is merely "in the style of ... Bashō." There are claims that this haiku is actually by Bashō (this Time.com article, for example). Is the haiku really by Bashō, or did Fleming pen it himself? If it is by Bashō, what is the original Japanese version? 

Lastly, the WoT Wikia says the Green Ajah is the largest behind the Red. Not sure what to make of that, though. 

Yet José Arcadio Segundo was the one who had the most complete grasp of the real world. The description of the brothel that Aureliano frequented is also telling: 

Alice Lee passed away about 8 months before Go Set a Watchman was published. All said and done, it looks very fishy. 

In Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive novels, the chapters are grouped into parts, the titles of the parts combining to form a ketek. For example, in the first book, The Way of Kings: 

I think this would be an example of synecdoche, a figure of speech where a part of something is used to represent it. Here, the "raw vigor" of the new money society and the "euphemisms" employed by the old money society represent their respective societies. The nouveau riche find themselves restricted and suffocated under the mores and norms of the unwelcoming traditional society, and thus they chafe under it. To chafe, here, is to: 

To summarise, as far as I can tell, Hubbard thinks that "pure" SF is fiction that has to do with material universe and sciences see 1 above and does not have elements of spiritualism, magic and other non-"material" phenomena see 2. 

In his Master's thesis, titled The peripeteia, an analysis of reversal speeches by Barbara Bush, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson, Christopher James Anderson of Iowa State University did exactly this, and presented some justification: 

The Intentional Fallacy is the fallacy of defining the meaning of a work using the author's intentions: The author intended their work to mean this, and so it means this. However, this has problems: 

While vamos in Spanish does mean "let's go!", it took on another meaning in America, and later on a different spelling: vamoose 

Whatever be the method, it's not likely to be a slow death. A slow, drawn-out death would only prolong the suffering, thus defeating the purpose of relieving the pain of the victim. Frost is talking about euthanasia here, and euthanasia is usually seen as humane, unlike say capital punishment. I don't think Frost is as concerned about the means of killing as he is with intent behind it - the "good" intention of relieving the suffering of life (compare with the "evil" intention of punishment, in the case of capital punishment). One is therefore easily associated with gentle actions, but not the other. Think of a doctor administering poison to a patient suffering a painful disease and of an executioner doing the same to a criminal - the former is at once associated with a gentleness, a kindness in the action, but the latter evinces brutality and ruthlessness. If you absolutely must have a method, think of how euthanasia is likely to be performed, or modern day humane executions: it could very well be via poison, but not likely to be hanging. 

Googled "short story love logical fallacy" and got a PDF to Love is a Fallacy by Max Shulman as the first result. Quoting: 

Without reading the story itself, just from what you have put in the question (detective talking about a criminal on parole who's committing a crime), I'd think that it isn't just "clemency foolishness". The foolishness here is the short prison time (counting parole) and clemency offered to prisoners when they show repentance — which, naturally, won't sit well with the detectives who put in time and effort into building a case only to see a wheedling criminal back on the streets in no time! Of course, parole violators usually lose any possibility of further parole or pardon of their sentence, so the detective thinks that if Jimmy is out on parole and has committed a crime, he's going back and not coming out again anytime soon. 

So what we have in such a report is whatever's left after all of the writer's biases have been applied. A different person could have observed and chose to report about slightly different things. 

That is why Hubbard spends so much time talking about fantasy. He's trying to distinguish science fiction from fantasy (hereafter SF and F) because he thinks there's a trend towards mixing genres and considering them SF. In his view, "pure" SF is any SF that doesn't have F elements in it. Towards the end, he says as much: 

By and large, I have found the writing style in the Malazan Book of the Fallen to be consistent across the first seven novels. They were all written by Steven Erikson. However, I feel there is a distinct shift in style in the eight book, Toll the Hounds, also written by Erikson. Toll the Hounds seems to feature numerous passages of a style similar to, for example, the concluding section of Book Two's Chapter 9: 

From the context, I do not think the monster is calling Frankenstein his natural lord and king, but is instead talking about the country's king. Note how this conversation starts with Frankenstein berating the monster for the murders he committed: 

Note that, while he does say SF "has to be based on some degree of plausibility", that's a very subjective judgement, and since this definition doesn't use it, I think we can leave plausibility out of the equation. And for F: 

Hubbard also stresses on science and SF being about people, but this isn't about defining SF. Instead it's about the point of science and SF: 

The Wikipedia article on this book says that a league here is something called a "metric" league, or 4 kilometres. With that figure, a league turns out to be 2.16 nautical miles, or 2.485 miles in modern units. At any rate, multiple passages indicate that the 2.16 figure is intentional: 

(Ethel Munro is Saki's sister.) And later on, while discussing The Lumber-Room, The Penance and Sredni Vashtar: 

Of these, I think the massacre is the strongest bit of evidence. Three thousand four hundred and eight people were slaughtered, and history was so convincingly re-written that nobody except José Arcadio Segundo and Aureliano believed it happened. Consider Úrsula's thoughts about José Arcadio Segundo when the latter spoke of these deaths to her: 

Because of Catch 22's twisted timeline, while reading it, several times I had the distinct impression that what seemed to have happened so far in the past was different from what apparently happened in the past of the current point:
