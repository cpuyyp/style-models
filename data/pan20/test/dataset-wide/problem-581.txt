Most times when the three situations above occur, on checking the mirror I see that no cars are approaching from behind (close enough to be a danger), and so there is no action required. On a typical 200km Audax ride I would say that I average 5 times where I have had to leave the bitumen. And on the other occasions I have just had to move over the white line on the left, to near the edge of the sealed verge. So I have left plenty of room for the overtaking car to not have to cross the centre line. Or maybe just by a small amount. This well rehearsed system has possibly saved my life on several occasions. The last one, about a year ago, was when I was daydreaming actually, enjoying a nice downhill run on a narrow road. Suddenly I heard the roar of a semi speeding down from behind! (I really should have spotted the truck earlier, either by the regular 10s check, or by noticing that about 200m ahead, at the bottom of the hill there was a blind corner to the right. A trigger point!) Well, as the driver 'put the pedal to the metal', the roar of the engine woke me up, so I instantly checked ahead - a blind corner! I just had enough time to use the brakes, slow a bit, and go onto the dirt and stop. Then I saw a large 4x4 come from around that corner, quite fast, and a lot less than 200m away by now! Just a second or so after that, the semi sped past me with his string of huge wheels on top of the white line. The same white line that I had to my left just a few seconds before! So it would have been either myself smashed to pulp, or that semi would have hit that 4x4, or hopefully the 4x4 driver, being alert to the problem, being able to leave the road without a roll-over! But by me being out of the way, right off the bitumen in this case, I had taken charge of the situation, and so I was not depending on others to do the right thing, or be alert and skilled enough to do the right thing. I had not only possibly saved my own life, but at the same time, by taking myself 'out of the picture', I was not putting other lives in danger either. It is a good feeling to be in control, and not be at the mercy of others. And as a result I don't feel at great risk, or in great danger, when riding out there on the highways with cars and trucks doing up to 110km/hr and sometimes more. Provided I stay alert and stick to my system - the 'system of bike control'. To put all this in a nutshell - Riders need eyes in the back of their heads - No, riders need a mirror. A rider without a mirror is a rider half blind. A rider with a mirror also needs a plan. A mirror without a plan is a mirror wasted. 

If you look down at your front hub while riding, you want it to be somewhere in the vicinity of being hidden by your handlebar. For a commuter bike, you want to be able to look forward (with your head more or less erect) without feeling like you're craning your neck. In said upright-head position, you shouldn't have to stretch for your handlebar. Your seat should be at a height such that your leg is mostly extended at the bottom of the pedal stroke, but you should not have to rock your hips at all during the bottom of the pedal stroke. Your seat should be situated fore/aft such that you can do the following: a. Tie a weight on the end of a string. b. Hold the non-weighted end of the string in the slight hollow on the outside front of your knee. c. The string should fall close to the spindle of your pedal when that pedal is at the front of the stroke (3 or 9 o'clock, depending on how you look at it) 

If all these things hold more or less true, and you're comfortable when you ride, don't stress what you look like. 

In small neighborhoods like this it's also not a bad idea to stay out in the lane and not hug the curb. This gives you much more time if a car or child comes hurtling out into the road and you're not going to be slowing down a following car very much. Edit: include the warning to watch for dogs. This is pretty important. 

You can also create semi-studded tires by wrapping zip-ties around the tire, with the lock in the same position the screws are shown in the illustrated answer. You'd need a bike with disk brakes for this to work. So for a road bike it would probably be slightly less than practical. 

I am an Audax club member and so am mostly riding on high speed country roads - B class highways in the main. Firstly I would say that just as a good driver should be using a 'system of car control' to avoid collisions, then in exactly they same manner, and with exactly the same system, so should a bike rider. And this would be whether in the city or the country. Bike riders should be even more diligent in using such a system because if they are hit they have absolutely no protection - just a foam helmet! The well recognised 'system of car control' emphasises the importance of knowing what is all around - both in front, and behind, on a regular 10 to 12 second basis. That is, the rear-view mirror should be checked about every 10 to 12 seconds in a car, and whenever a hazard is first detected. I do the same on my bike - both in city and country riding. I use a good sized mirror that is sturdy, does not vibrate on coarse metal roads, or get pushed around by the wind, and is either flat or only very slightly curved. The mirror should be able to see a silver or white car at least 300m away. They are the hardest to see because they can blend in with the clouds. A curved mirror is not up to the job. And there are an awful lot of silver cars out there! Although a curved mirror, not too small or too curved, is ideal for the city. I have also developed a particular system I call 'trigger points' - points in the ride that trigger me to check my mirror, over and above the regular 10 - 12 second checks. These trigger points are due to three hazards that are of particular relevance to riders, especially on high speed country roads, to avoid being hit by a car coming from behind. Those that overtake when it is not safe to do so. The three situations, or hazards, that cause me to instantly check the mirror are a) an ONCOMING CAR, b) a BLIND CORNER less than 200m ahead (or less than 100m - 150m behind),or c) a BLIND CREST less than 200m ahead (or less than 100 - 150m behind). I have observed that a) in the situation of an on-coming car, and another car coming up from behind, most (I estimate 80% to 90% of drivers) do not do the right thing and slow down behind the bike, and wait until the oncoming car has passed before overtaking. b) and c) - In the case of blind corners and crests - Most drivers just hope that no car will suddenly appear from around that blind corner, or over that crest, while they are on the wrong side of the road. I do not take the "bugger you, I'm all right" approach. That is, just keep riding along hoping that if a car does approach from behind, that the car will do the right thing and slow down and wait. But if they don't, and then have an accident - a head-on-collison, or a side swipe with the oncoming car, or a roll over as they try to avoid that car . . . "Well it wasn't my fault - it was their fault. I was entitled to be on the road - they should have waited before overtaking . . . I never got hit, so too bad people, sorry you are injured, or dead, but at least I am still alive. And I did not break the law - you did." Of course the bike rider will also be at risk in these situations, whether by the overtaking car suddenly realising they are in trouble and just trying to miss the rider by a few cm, or actually deciding that they have to save their own neck by wiping out the cyclist! By doing that mirror check when triggered, in that 200m 'danger zone' before those three particular hazards, then I have plenty of time to move right over to the left of the bitumen so that any overtaking car can safely pass without having to cross the centre line. Or if the sealed surface is not wide enough, I have plenty of time to slow down to a safe speed so that I can go onto the unsealed side of the road. Either stopping if it is unsafe for my tyres, or continuing riding slowly until the cars have passed, and I check the mirror, plus head turn, before going back to the bitumen. All this is just exactly what good car drivers do anyway - use the same system. 

I really want to ride the Lotoja, from Logan, Utah to Jackson, Wyoming (206 miles). There's some beautiful scenery along that route (I've driven it several times) and enough up and down to make it really challenging. I also really want to ride the Salt to Saint, from Salt Lake City, Utah to St. George, Utah. Since it goes through my hometown and all... Also, some beautiful views along the route. 

Lube your chain frequently. As in every time it rains if you need to. Depending on the drive-train, you can get Shimano or SRAM chains at places like Nashbar or Performance Bike, but even top-of-the-line, expensive chains will get rusty if they're out in the rain all the time. The same will hold with a Brooks saddle. No matter how awesome it is, if it's exposed to poor conditions without proper maintenance, it will deteriorate quickly. So lube your chain frequently, and dry it off whenever you get a chance before storing it. Disclaimer: If you go riding around with tons of lube on your chain in dry, dusty conditions, you'll pick up lots of dirt in your drivetrain. 

It will probably depend on terrain, speed, and other aerodynamic (or lack thereof) factors whether one would even notice a difference between an "aero" frame or a "normal" frame. If you're climbing lots of hills, riding in traffic, or otherwise not in a position where wind resistance is your chief enemy, I doubt you'd see a benefit from going aero. If you live out in the farmlands and ride on fast, flat roads, or somewhere that has lots of wind, you may notice a difference, because wind/air resistance becomes a factor. 

Perhaps your best option is Gear Finder provided by Bicycling Magazine. They have various bikes organized by type, price, and some sub-details. As for why you don't see the same types of databases that you see for computer products, this is because the people who actually make these things (computer programmers) are much more likely to be interested in computers (as a product) than bicycles. 

I can't speak specifically to "touching" vs "passing", as you have put it, but it would seem to be a similar rationale to tying & soldering wheels, which is supposedly done to increase stiffness, and prevent spokes from rattling in the event they break. This article (by Jobst Brandt, for better or worse) seems to dispute the stiffness claim, but I don't think it changes the rationale much. 

You may run into some poor shifting performance, but the system should still function. If you are unhappy with the performance, 8 speed chainrings will mount on your current crankset, so there's no need to change-up everything. 

Many bike shops actually offer demo saddles so riders have a chance to try them out without buying them. You should call around any see if any of the shops in your area offer such an option. If you can't demo the saddle, the first thing you need to figure out is why your saddle is uncomfortable. Saddles can be uncomfortable for two main reasons: because there isn't material where you want it, or because there is material where you don't want it. When you're sitting on your current saddle, where are you feeling pressure. Ideally, it should be on your sit bones. If it isn't, do you need a saddle that's narrower or wider? If you're having issues with numbness, you might find it beneficial to adapt a saddle with a cutout. If you're experiencing chafing, you probably need a narrower saddle with less padding. You may also wish to examine the angle of your current saddle. A typical rider will want to have the saddle horizontal, but even a few degrees of tilt can make a huge difference. 

I ride a single-speed (as opposed to fixed gear) because I like to be able to coast down a hill without worrying about spinning out, or hitting a pot-hole while frantically trying to keep up with my pedals. Don't get me wrong, I love riding fixed-gear, but for where I live it's just a little impractical to not be able to coast. I ride a single-speed (as opposed to a geared bike) for multiple reasons. A: It's all I could afford. If you only have $600, you'll get a lot more bike with a single-speed than a geared bike. Or rather, you'll get a lighter bike with better hubs/wheels/etc than for a $600 geared bike. Someday I'll have the money for a decent road bike (105/Rival or better) and will buy one. But for now, my single-speed is much lighter and sturdier than any $600 geared road bike I could have gotten. B: I enjoy the simplicity. Want to go faster? Pedal faster. C: I enjoy the workout. I live in Utah, where there are some pretty big hills/mountains. The only way to get to the top is to (as my dad used to say) hunker down and gut it out. There's something quite invigorating about knowing you conquered that hill with the power in your legs instead of the mechanical advantage of your gear ratio. D: Even on the freewheel side of my hub, my single-speed is quiet. No gears means that unless I'm coasting, my bike is nearly silent. 

If it's not broken, don't fix it. The act of folding ourselves onto a bicycle, (especially one with any kind of aerodynamic advantage over a mountain bike) is not a natural-looking position for a human body. We're built to be more or less upright, which is not an aerodynamic position on the bike. So, if you're comfortable on your bike and feel like you're ok with the amount of wind-resistance you create for yourself, and your bike is properly sized for you, there's not much you'd really want to change. A couple of general bike position loose guidelines (yes, general and loose are a bit redundant here, but these are not hard fast rules):
