I think a little more information is needed to be sure. You say "after the interview was over", but of course any interview might be broken into multiple stages and appointments on the day. If the conversation went: 

Assuming you're correct about the law, which I am not in any position to assess, the question in effect is, "how do I defend my legal right against my employer in this situation?". You should of course get some kind of individual advice to ensure that your reading of the law is correct and applicable to your case, before doing anything drastic. But as you present it this seems pretty simple: 

I think it depends what your concern is. Extreme example, but if their CV admits they used to work as a con-artist doing street hustles, then it would be legitimate for you to wonder whether they can be trusted with your clients even if they've done their time (assuming it's legal in their particular circumstances to consider their criminal record), or even if they weren't convicted due to lack of evidence. If they worked as a lawyer for a firm that specialised in vexatious litigation, then you might be concerned they'll bring a gung-ho attitude to their new role that's out of character for your firm. In each case, the thing to think/talk about is whether they will treat your clients honestly rather than trying to trick them, and whether they are excessively willing to bring unmerited legal actions. Avoid their ethical or political assessment of their former employment. Talk about their approach to the job they'll be doing, and how they've previously handled tasks similar to what will be required, and keep an eye out for them advocating shady practices. Don't make disavowing his previous line of work a condition for employment with you, just do enough to be confident that whatever it is about that line of work that conflicts with the requirements of this job, he knows not to bring it with him. Also, be sure that the issue relates to the job they're applying for. You say that you consider it ethically questionable, but more importantly does the employer they're applying to, as a distinct entity from you the interviewer, consider it ethically questionable? If you just happen to think that butchers are unethical because you're a vegetarian, that's not relevant to a job selling double-glazing. Next, be sure that what the candidate did poses a potential problem before going into it: treating the typist at an arms dealer who sells landmines differently from the typist at a kitten sanctuary, or asking them to justify their willingness to work there, is probably just prejudice. All you're really doing then is to make sure he's "a good fit" to carry out the goals of this company, and do the job the way you think it should be done. Which is legitimate. In some cases there could even be an obvious "poacher turned gamekeeper" scenario, like if the MPAA hired someone who formerly worked for Pirate Bay or vice-versa. In that case it would be strange not to talk about how they can apply their past experience on the other side of the argument. Aside from this, if you have a potential PR issue on your hands ("Former concentration camp guard employed by State Department!", "CEO of LovelyFamilyCorp sold cluster bombs to Russia!") then their history genuinely is relevant even if it was legal at the time. 

Not unless their boss (you) has told them this is important. Even if the company would prefer him to recognise managers, it would be rather disproportionate to make disciplinary matter of it on the first offence, early in his employment, if he has never been told that it's important. 

My personal experience of this is Symbian/C++. Fortunately there's no immediate danger of anyone wanting me (or anyone else) to use it again, so I don't think I would avoid mentioning it. But it's not relevant to much, so it would belong in the employment history section. You have to consider a few things: 

As Mohair says, there are several grounds on which an employer can in principle discipline you for something said in the pub: there is no general sanctuary offered by licensed premises! Furthermore there are rules whose details I don't know, about when a social event to which colleagues are generally invited can be considered a work-related event and therefore directly subject to HR scrutiny. Relevant to this case, though, HR might be concerned about a couple of things, and I'm bearing in mind that what you've quoted might not be the worst of what was reported: 

If you don't want to ask them directly about interview attire (and asking is a risk, because of it being "common sense"), then look into what people from the company wear to meet clients. This is their idea of "smart for strangers", and in most posts there's some chance they'll stick you in front of a client occasionally and they'll want to know you'll look alright. So they probably won't hold it against you. But if there's a big difference between what their salesfolk wear to meet clients and what their developers wear to meet clients then get yourself the right side of that gap. 

No, it's not all about creating value together. If it was really a zero-sum and you don't care who wins, you wouldn't even have an acceptable range. You'd just pay everyone literally whatever they ask for. The reason you don't do that is, ultimately, the same as the reason you might negotiation within your range. To save money for the employer. It's just different amounts of money. 

Correct, and you cannot get that assurance. The company is in trouble, or it would not have already made more than one round of layoffs. The people they laid off, especially in second and subsequent rounds, are people they previously valued and thought they needed. Aside from more layoffs, the company could go out of business. It could get a big new contract and start hiring again. Realistically the former is more likely than the latter, but you need a job, and no job or employer is secure forever, so you accept some risk. I've been in this position, although there was only ever one set of layoffs, not multiple rounds. The time from the layoffs until when the company (actually, a sort of follow-on company, the details were complicated) went bust was about 8 years or so. Not everyone plans to be at their current employer for 8 years anyway, and in fact I left 4 or 5 years before the bust. So what the heck. I don't think I played the situation perfectly, but whenever anything ends badly you'll wish you'd ended it sooner. Accept that. 

Of course this is necessary. If you have no particular culturally-induced or personal bias against women (etc...), and neither do your colleagues, then this would also be sufficient and therefore would form a sensible complete policy. Some would question whether it's possible or probable to grow up in our culture and be free of such bias, and you can agree or disagree with that as you see fit. All I can say is what to do if you suspect there might be bias and you want to reduce it. So, if you don't examine your treatment of different personalities, different skillsets, different styles, and all the rest of it, with a view to whether or not you are exhibiting direct or indirect bias against women (etc.), then you're falling short of the highest standard. If you're a large enough institution, you may even be falling short of the bare minimum acceptable standard in law or basic decency. Examples of indirect bias abound. In some cases they are created intentionally with the purpose of disadvantaging the target group. Don't bother trying to defend the "separate but equal" doctrine, or pre-civil-rights voter literacy laws, with hindsight. But for a while they held up as ostensibly non-racist. In some cases they're accidental but prejudicial, for example you might unintentionally judge someone's "enthusiasm for the job" in part by their willingness to do overtime at short notice, ignoring the fact that childcare responsibilities are, for reasons that have nothing to do with people's enthusiasm about their jobs, not equally balanced between the genders in your society. Then you would be ascribing as free choice something that, to someone in this hypothetical society, is in fact somewhat constrained by their gender role. Of course in theory one would only use willingness to do overtime to judge someone's availability for overtime, not their enthusiasm for the job, but it's very easy to ignore what contributes to your "overall impression" of someone. In some cases indirect biases might be trivial, and raising them is a fuss about nothing. For example, it turned out on balance that requiring women to wear shorts/leggings to play football (by which I mean soccer) was way more sensible than making any kind of special accommodation to invent a version of football that could be played in whalebone skirts and corsets. That is a joke, the serious version of the issue is what happens in countries where women are constrained by law or public sense of decency not to dress as is best to play football. Then, through no choice of their own, they require special accommodation in terms of playing attire if they're to play at all. If you cannot eliminate some prevailing sexism, then it is not "sexist" to try to mitigate it, even if the result is different treatment. If the prevailing sexism were eliminated, then naturally the different treatment could be brought to an end. To make women feel welcome (or members of any group rare in your workplace that you're concerned may suffer from exclusion), you need to not just apply your standards of judgement while ignoring the possibility that prejudice or bias might occur, you need to actively check whether any is happening in the workplace, because not all "equal treatment" is the same in this respect. Expecting people to wear red is gender-neutral, expecting people to wear a beard is not, even though "some men can't grow beards", "women could get fake beards", "I'm treating everyone exactly the same, the only difference is some people can meet the standard and others can't", or any other objection someone might raise to political correctness gone mad when this beard policy is questioned. Expecting people to wear pink, even, might not be gender-neutral, depending how people typically respond to pink clothes in your locality. That in turn is cultural. The general public's responses are unaffected by your careful treatment of people as individuals: you can set a good example but you can't affect everyone. If you can examine yourself (which nobody can perfectly), then you don't "treat people differently because they're a woman", but you also avoid unintentionally "treating them like a man even though they're a woman". I have intentionally used extreme examples throughout, so as not to delay on explaining just how the reasoning follows. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to identify any less clear-cut cases that really do happen in your workplace and that might contribute to an unwelcoming atmosphere, or even to an impossible environment, for most or all members of some particular group. 

You shouldn't worry about this, it's not really your concern unless you think the rest of the company will judge you primarily by this one aspect of the behaviour of the team you belong to. If your team truly is perceived as clowns by the rest of your company then it's unlikely that of your team, only you have noticed this. But just in case, you could think about cautiously reporting some of the comments you've heard from others. If your team is not generally perceived as clowns, but you perceive them that way, then think about who is more likely to be right (and who has the right to decide what's an acceptable level of clowning around) -- one junior employee or the whole rest of the company. So, they're clowns. When you build a team from scratch, you can decide that you want it to be a team of non-clowns. This is not that team. If the problem is senior colleagues are shooting at you Unless there's something peculiar in your contract or your job description, you are entitled not to be targeted yourself if you don't want to be, so do not feel that you must tolerate stuff being thrown/fired at you. If they're shooting you and you want them to stop that aspect of it, then you can ask them (calmly and politely) to stop. Most people are not such jerks as to continue after that, so in most places that will be the end of it. If you don't want to address them directly then go through your line manager. If you ask them and they don't stop, again go to your line manager. Remember that you're not trying to stop them shooting each other, your goal is for them to stop shooting you. Now, it's possible that the team will dislike you for "not joining in" or "not having a sense of humour". This is called bullying. Most people who engage in bullying aren't terrible people, they just haven't really thought through the effects of them imposing their idea of "cool" or "fun" behaviour on people who do not enjoy that behaviour at all. Perhaps they need help seeing that launching stuff at people might make that person feel uncomfortable or threatened. They will generally say that they are not bullies, rather that there is something wrong with you for not enjoying what they do to you. They probably truly believe that, because although everyone knows that the thing called "bullying" is wrong, they aren't necessarily capable of realising when they're doing it. That is all part of the bullying. If you're bullied there may not be much point telling your line manager or HR in so many words that you're being bullied. You're better off sticking to reporting specific actions and incidents. However, when an organisation supports bullying your line manager will favour the bullies, will say that you need to take a little hazing to fit in, that everyone else puts up with it, etc. It is incredibly difficult to uproot this culture, and one junior member will not manage it alone. Expect to move on one way or another, perhaps an internal transfer to a less aggressive group if the company has several teams. It's possible, but unlikely, that you have simply stumbled into a nest of intolerable jerks. For example, if your company sets its standards by those of professional sports teams, and you don't see yourself buying into that "jock" culture, then you might just have to look elsewhere. 

Unfortunately as a role-player myself I think constant exposure can make you forget how sensitive civilians can be. Of those you list, there's really very little in White Wolf that isn't a little bit controversial or that some people wouldn't want to put age-inappropriacy tags on. I don't just mean the back cover of the 1st ed. clanbook Tzimisce. If Twilight is insipid for your taste, and your writing reflects that, then basically you're admitting that you're desensitized to what I'd call "serious" depictions of monsters and some other people would call "controversial" or "adult" depictions! The White Wolf books used to have "reader discretion is advised", and "vampires aren't real", in the small print. Of course non World-of-Darkness lines like Exalted are easier to keep happy and bouncy. If you're applying for jobs where you need to demonstrate creative writing, hirers should allow some latitude for you to have written on subjects that are a tiny bit edgy. Even outside that, most people don't care that you're interested in horror or violence in fiction, even if they wouldn't show your horror-themed or combat-oriented RPG writing to their children. And sure, mainstream TV and movies are very violent too, not to mention riddled with sex, and often fantasy and SF-based. So the fact it's written genre fiction should make no difference. But there's no accounting for taste. Some people just don't approve of "that sort of thing" and think those who like it will be somehow weird or frivolous in general. Some small residue exists of people who are in-real-life horrified by it, and a slightly larger group who aren't horrified by it but would consider it inappropriate to have on a CV unless writing is directly relevant to the job. Or who (ironically, giving the feelings of the horrified people) will think playing games is a bit childish. Yeah, I know. It surely can't be off-putting to most hiring managers. A majority either won't care about your creative writing and won't look at it, or else they'll look at it and won't be shocked that some people are interested in fantasy/horror/manga/games/general geekery. A minority will disapprove of your taste, although most of them still won't consciously make it part of their hiring decision. You may experience things differently in an extremely conservative area, if there are any left where people still believe Jack Chick. Or there are probably countries in the world where speculative/horror fiction in general, and RPGs in particular, really haven't permeated and would be seen as odd or bad.
