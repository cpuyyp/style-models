Stars already have a very strong magnetic field, metal content won't help on that front as they are made up from plasma rather than solid matter anyway. The average strength of the magnetic field of the sun is around twice that of earth, however at certain points it can be as much as 8000 times as strong and it actually extends out as far as Pluto! Source: $URL$ For the magnetic field between the planets, you can expect it to stabilize so that the two are attracting each other, in other words the magnetic north of one planet will be near the magnetic south of the other. They will then act as an attractive force and effectively make gravity stronger between the two worlds, this means they will orbit faster and closer together than gravity alone would allow. The magnetic and rotational north poles may not be at the same location, but it is likely that they would be in this case as that is the only way that the forces would all balance out smoothly. In other words both worlds would rotate around the same central axis, the magnetic and rotational poles would be aligned and the magnetic north and south poles would also be facing in the same direction. The worlds would be orbiting each other faster than normally expected due to gravity alone. 

The first problem is what all of these people already know. Presumably, they know that the apocalypse is coming. Given that a dome/habitat has been made, they also have some idea of what kind of apocalypse it will be. That's either really good or really bad. If it's the kind of apocalypse that starts at breakfast and is over by brunch, it's all good. If it's the kind that starts at Christmas and ends at no-one-even-knows-what-that-is-anymore-because-it-was-so-amazingly-long-ago, that's bad. See, the trouble with these people is that they all love someone. It's really easy to tell them all that they can bring one person, but they will never get past what it will do to the ones they leave behind. With that in mind, the goal should be to minimize the discomfort associated with leaving one's loved ones to die horrible deaths. First off, control information. Whatever these people don't absolutely need to know, don't tell them. Sugar-coat it. "Yes, the comet will hit in a blaze of fantastic glory and everything outside of this cool dome thing will be instantly vaporized." That's the line you want. Make it okay for the relatives that get left behind. No pain, no suffering, they won't even know it. Secondly, everyone wants to spend time with their loved ones, so allow them their freedom until, say, three days before the big bad is about to go down. Make sure the dome is up and running well before then, but don't require the specials to be there until basically the last minute. Until then, send them home. Send them home with cash. Lots and lots of cash. Basically, give these people the absolute best last days with their families. Make it idyllic, and impress upon them the fact that, if they truly love these people, they shouldn't tell them what's coming. Just hug them, kiss them, tell them you love them, and then promise you'll be back in a few days. In short, give everyone the goodbye they wanted. Of course, every special gets to bring exactly one other person with them. Really, these specials can't be the only people in the dome or there's really no reason to have the dome, so if each of them gets a plus one, not really a big problem. Except Mrs. Norman. For whatever reason, Mr. Norman absolutely is not allowed because he has some something or other that would endanger the colony. Mrs. Norman has to come, otherwise it would look bad, but she can't bring her husband. Also, these secondary specials do not get to know that the apocalypse is coming or you'll have the same problem with them. These secondaries only get to know that they are going somewhere with their lovers/best friends for a few days. Also, just a thought here, but make sure your Twitter stars can actually talk to people. I mean, I don't know who these people are, but there is that not-baseless stereotype about amazing online personalities that simply cannot deal with actual in-the-flesh-people. If the point of bringing them into the dome is to entertain the inhabitants, make sure they will actually be able to once the internet goes down. I know this creates a secondary population of seemingly useless people, but really, we don't fully understand what makes a person's genes worth keeping. It's possible that hidden in the genetic folds of "dat ass" is coding for incredibly IQ, or massive strength, or some other unexpressed trait. Every person holds the possibility of a beneficial mutation or genetic twitch, and just as you shouldn't breed two natural-bob-tail Australian shepherds, you shouldn't breed only the humans humans decided should be bred. We simply don't know enough, so even if you wanted to optimize the gene pool, you should include a few wild cards, and you might as well kill two birds with one stone. If nothing else, they can be taught useful skills. If absolutely nothing else, they'll breath carbon dioxide for your plants. For general vetting purposes, these same rules apply. Figure out exactly what you need, find the best people for the job, tell them as little as possible while conveying what they need to know, allow them to bring ONE person if they so choose, and give them the best good-bye period you can. As for what you'll want, picture a scaled down United States. You'll need a governing body, enforced by a police structure of some kind. You'll need food workers from growing to processing to cooking. You'll need sewers and weavers and builders and herdsmen and blacksmiths. The important consideration is how big the dome is. However many people it can support at maximum, figure on half that population, then half of that population is your specials. The secondaries will all be apprenticed to an appropriate occupation. If you end up with people who refuse to cooperate, kick them out into the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Moreover, let them know that if they get the boot, their loved one does as well. 

Animal interactions Herbivores would avoid sound at all costs. Creatures such as hummingbirds would likely not exist, since they would likely damage flowers/each other etc.. But if you're not being too careful with physics, it would be interesting to see the light come off their wings. Birds would focus on large wing structures to avoid unecessary flapping. Insects may be very different (imagine how easy the life of a predator would be when it's food literally lights up like a christmas tree). Possible insect adaptions include: 

The main problem you have here is recoil, anything you fire out forwards pushes the gun backwards. This can be fixed if we make the bullets self propelled (essentially tiny rockets). Antimatter would provide sufficient energy density for this. For bonus points the remaining antimatter would cause a small explosion when you strike the target and the result would be catastrophic for anyone hit as these bullets would be high caliber, extremely fast, high explosive force...and would even home in on the target with a very basic guidance system. From a technical/scientific point of view the antimatter would need to be generated somewhere, but the real trick is going to be storing it. If the antimatter is stored in the bullets then they would need some sort of hard vacuum chamber suspending the antimatter in the center somehow. Containment breaches would be bad and very hard to avoid. A more likely system would be to have the gun store or even better (safer) generate the antimatter on demand (this would involve some serious power sources though so containment might be the only option) and the bullets are filled with antimatter as part of the firing process. An enemy strike on the antimatter reservoir of a gun would be seriously catastrophic for anyone in the area though. Expect shielding those to be a high priority. 

Actually, as AndreiROM mentioned, the reason we age is because our cells lose a little information each time they replicate. We have evolved to handle this by capping our chromosomes with telomeres, sequences of repeating nonsense DNA, so that we don't lose anything important for the first many replications. It has been proposed that extending the telomeres could extend life. In theory, it would be possible to create a virus that inserted additional telomere sequences into the cell, allowing the cell a longer reproductive life and the person a longer life in general. This would have the added bonuses of flexible time-lengths (if you want a person's life extended by a longer span, give him one virus, if you want it extended by a shorter amount, give him a different virus) as well as retaining youth/middle-age. We get wrinkles and such because our cells are no longer all replicating like they used to, but with added telomere, we would still look and act like our younger selves. Note that this sort of virus will only work to slow aging from the point of infection on. It will not reverse ageing. It could be re-applied on a regular basis to grant immortality, and the virus need not be kept alive in the host. Once it deposits it's genes, it can be killed, however it is necessary for all the body's cells to be affected, so to make this actually work, the virus would probably cause either a near-death experiance (when the virus replicates within the body- it cannot be treated until the procedure is complete, and replication is what causes the symptoms of disease) or a prolonged period of mild effects. The easiest way for a virus like this to come about would be through engineering, but if you want it to be natural, explain it lightly. Really, all a telomere is is a string of DNA that the cell can afford to lose, so any viral DNA that could be attached properly to the ends of the chromosomes could function as a telomere. Presumably this virus comes from another planet, or some long-lost cave or some such, so it could be explained as the human cell's response to this particular viral code. The host cell just sticks the sequence at the end of the chromosome, the sequence does not code for any human proteins, so it functions like a telomere. This could be tied in to religion if you like. Maybe the reason the Mayans were so concerned with the future was because they knew that some of them would be living in it. The sacred caves of South America could contain the source of the virus, and the priests/priestesses went to talk to the gods, got infected, and lived for centuries. This could also be tied in to human sacrifice. Maybe the virus lives in some kind of cave creature that must be fed. Like a subterranean virus factory. Sorry, I went off on a tangent, but the point is, yes, it is totally possible for such a virus to exist, either man-made or natural, and you can tie it into all kinds of stuff if you want to give an extensive background. 

You need two factors to create a rainbow - suspended water droplets and direct sunlight. If your weather was extremely dry then you remove the droplets, equally if it was always overcast you remove the direct sunlight. So a desert dwelling people with water flowing in through rivers or underground aquifers would never see a rainbow. Seasonal variations where you have a continuously overcast and rainy season followed by a dry season might also work, although you have a chance of rainbows happening during the transition. Harder to explain than either of the above would be an area where rain only happens at night. It would be dry and clear during the day then when night falls clouds roll in and the rain begins. 

Other herbivores may adapt to use vibrations to knock down fruit etc. from trees. Predators would also rely on being as quiet as possible, but catching prey would look magnificent. Subtle adaptions could include multiple resonance chambers in a thick skull to frighten prey or even incapacitate at close distance. Nature, and human adaption to it Places that frequently earthquake or lightening would be out of bounds. It would just not be plausible to live there. If anything lived there would either fly or do something to disconnect it from the vibrations. Sounds that cause sounds etc. would naturally dissipate, although likely much more destructively than our world (as mentioned before). The side effect of this is that sound would travel much less in media it could destroy. For example, you might not hear a pot falling in the kitchen upstairs, but you might find the pot melted and the ground dented. You would build floors that don't break so easily. Avalanches would likely become earthquakes, but again, the energy would travel less. But the mountainside might take a hit because of the sound. Summary Issue 1 Sound would dissipate more quickly so it wouldn't travel as far. In solid media, sound would likely cause more destruction (and therefore travel less). Issue 2 Intelligent beings would likely deal with the issue of scale themselves and naturally avoid dangerous circumstances (much the way humans avoid overly hot or cold climates). Issue 3 The most pronounced change would be that animals would try to eliminate sound as much as possible. Anything that gives away an animals position is usually a disadvantage in the wild. Packs of animals could destroy prey/trees/rocks by emitting sound from different points in space aimed at the same place. 

With advances in technology and society though what is the most likely new form of government that may develop in our world as a successor to Representative Democracy and how might it work? I am interested in answers that come from any of our current world countries (so Russian, western or middle east or anywhere else is fine) and where the new form of government arises within the next twenty to fifty years. Any technological solutions are welcome but not required, the question really is "looking at where we are now what might come next?" Answers will be rated based on plausibility (both that the society will function and that we could transition to it) and on originality (they should be different both from our current systems of governance and ones that have been widely used in the past). 

Human interactions Language would be vastly different. If spoken language exists, it would be very different to what we experience today. A form of sign language could be a possible adaption to having such a dangerous organ (the voice box). If humans developed a spoken language, they would be careful not to speak over each other, as accidental harmonics wouldn't be pleasant. A baby would soon learn that shouting loudly would hurt, so they wouldn't shout. In fact, any kind of hearing would become unnecessary, since all sound has real consequences. As has already been mentioned, music would be limited. The natural instincts of parents would be greatly altered. Humans who learn to whistle and sing at the same time would have unnatural power. However, it's quite possible their lips would become calloused (as a guitar player's hands do) from the vibrations. Inner mouth shields could possibly be developed to bounce sound out of the mouth instead of going into the head, allowing for stronger sound output from the mouth. This also has implications for impressive 'concerts' involving light shows similar to fire-spitting performers. Also, martial arts involving harmonics? TV's etc. would likely not produce any sound as something that is designed to be on for long periods of time will eventually cause damage to the surrounding structure. Also, accidental harmonic resonance with the surrounding environment could cause unwanted destruction. This leads to several questions about communication in general. Assuming sign language takes over:
