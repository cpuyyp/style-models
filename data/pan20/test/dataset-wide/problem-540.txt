Make the small investment in a chain checker ( I like park tools CC-3.2). I would generally recommend one of them that measures the chain based on length rather than lateral deflection. Each manufacturer will probably have it's own recommendation, but a safe bet is to always replace your chain before '.75' (75% wear). This will maximize the life of your cassette and chainrings as they will not be ridden on a stretched chain. It also eliminates individual variation, as some people will stretch a chain more or less over a given distance ridden ( some people like to mash and others like to spin). It is also a good idea to keep your chain clean, as a dirty chain acts like sandpaper as it is cranked over the teeth of the chainring and cassette. By simply replacing the chain at the proper intervals I have made cassettes and chainrings last years of frequent use. I don't know exact numbers but they would be pretty meaningless as they vary with rider and conditions. Certainly more than 2 chains per cassette. 

Is this a bottom bracket that you know the origins of? it is possible that this is an English bottom bracket cup (1.37in ≈ 34.79mm) rather than an Italian one (36mm ≈ 1.41in) if the frame is Italian thread. If the problem is ultimately the threads, I would try some Teflon tape or thread locker (blue) before I scrapped the whole thing. If you really, really love the frame, there are some companies that make 'compression fit' bottom brackets that don't use the threads (I believe Phil wood makes a very expensive one). 

Halo Supadrive utilizing 120 points of engagement SRAM's Double Time design utilizes four pawls in opposed pairs. The pairs are offset slightly, causing only one pair to engage at any time, but gives their 26 tooth ratchet 52 points of engagement for 7 degree engagement. 

12mm thru - I believe the top part shown here is the interior portion of the cap These caps are something that simply 'fills the gap' between an oversize bearing inside the hub and the desired axle. Rear On these particular hubs, the rear seems to operate somewhat differently. The drive side end cap appears to thread onto an oversize axle (to set preload?). I believe that the axle itself functions as the mating surface for the non drive side of the hub. 

This sounds like an incomplete bleed. If you hang your bike vertically, try pulling the rear brake lever after it has sat overnight (front wheel up). if it feels extra bad that confirms it. Or if you notice that the brake feels better after a few 'pumps'. That said, I had noticed with my SLX brakes that the front and rear had a different 'feel' possibly. Not that they acted differently at all, but felt different through the stroke of the lever. I thought it was possible it was the factory bleed, which wouldn't be the case for you, but perhaps there is something to it. Or possibly a difference in friction in the Pistons in the caliper or lever somehow. On my Jamis dragon actually (separate M675 from above), I think the front brake ended up with too much oil from the factory bleed on the front. I couldn't get the pads open enough to not rub the disc. I put a bleed block in the caliper and opened the bleed screw on the lever and that pressure alone pushed a bunch of oil out. I closed it up and everything worked as it should have. Possibly something similar has happened in your case, but too little oil? (this could happen if the Pistons were too far retracted in caliper/lever not fully open during bleed) side notes: Of course the front lever is going to provide more stopping power as it has greater mechanical advantage. Also some bikes have a larger front rotor. And never rule out quality control. 

a basic animation of the mechanism in action can be found here. In this design, some tension must be applied to the pawls to constantly force them outward into the body of the hub. (This is also where the buzz or click comes from in this design, from the pawls being forced over the teeth on the ratchet surface) This is usually accomplished by leaf springs, small coil springs, and/or a metal ring. 

If you remove the hub, what is left? A rim and some spokes... if your goal is to reuse as much as possible, you could possibly lace a new hub to the rim. The problem is that it is pretty unlikely that the spokes will be reusable. Going from one hub to the next, you can occasionally with some decent planning get that to work. With an internal hub going to an externally geared hub it is pretty unlikely as usually internal hubs have a large hub body and very tall flanges. This causes them to use very short spokes that would never reach the flanges of a standard hub. You could look into it, using online spoke length calculators, and see if there is a hub that would let you reuse the spokes. However, building a wheel this way is not a great introduction to wheelbuilding! Used spokes, used rim.. it will all behave differently and go together with more difficulty than new parts due to inconsistencies and wear. If you would like to take that on AND you can reuse the spokes, it will probably be cheaper than a new wheel. If you can't reuse the spokes, it would end up being cheaper to just buy a new rear wheel (not even taking into account that you may get a small amount of money for the current rear wheel). 

This sounds like the small ring was used a lot more than the large ring and the chain is jumping off the worn out teeth under pressure. compare the tooth profile of the two chainrings and see if they look different. 

Standard Pawl and Ratchet Design This design is by far the most common on bicycle freehubs, and as such the least expensive to employ. Mechanism In it's simplest form, this design consists of a surface that is toothed and a pawl (which is a lever that engages the toothed surface and only allows movement in one direction). 

Maintaining a constant casing tension and wall thickness we can solve for pressure and see that the pressure is inversely proportional to the diameter. 

clockwise: 9mm drive side, 15mm drive side, 9mm non drive, 15mm non drive Hope A nice blog post here that describes the process of changing the hub to a different axle standard. A few photos from the post: before add pliers.. 

1. end piece 2. bearing 3. thread ring 4. axle 5. conical spring 6. star ratchet 7. rotor body The DT Swiss system consists of two ratchet opposed ratchet plates that reside in the hub body and the freehub. These are held against each other by a pair of conical springs. When the rider pedals, the teeth engage as the freehub ratchet plate is turned via the splines along its circumference. This transfers power to the ratchet plate in the hub, and this in turn transfers power to the hub via the splines along its circumference. 

from $URL$ The rear should measure 126mm I would expect, and the front should almost certainly be 100mm (any wheelset that meets the specifications for the rear should also fit the front) 

After looking more closely at the photos, it looks like the specific hubs/wheels in question are the Prime Comp Alloy Clincher Disc Road Wheelset seen here. These have Prime RD020 Disc Hubs - front and rear. Looking closely, it doesn't seem as though these are rebranded novatec hubs, but they do seem to utilize a very similar end cap design. Front For the front, it looks as though the end caps pop in: 

Any hollowtech II bottom bracket should be compatible with your crankset. For the frame, you will need to make sure you get the proper thread. Most frames will be BSA thread. Older Italian frames will be Italian thread. If your frame is Italian thread, both bearing cups will thread on clockwise. If it is not, the drive side will thread on counter clockwise. Pay attention to the spacer arrangement on your frame and install the bottom bracket with the same arrangement. Should just be a pretty simple swap. 

A bicycle of that era will likely need 27" wheels and 126mm rear spacing. To confirm this, you could put a quick release or other straight small object through the dropouts (as if it were an axle) and measure the distance to the brake pads. A 27" is going to be around 630mm/2 = 315mm in radius to where the tire sits, so the brake pads should be able to extend a little bit closer to the dropouts than this (this is not exactly a way to determine what size wheels the frame was designed for, but just determine that they will work). Depending on exactly when it is from in that era and the quality of the bike, its possible that it would use 700c wheels (which have a very similar 622mm diameter) but very unlikely. The spacing is the distance inside the dropouts: 

As long as you have brake cables that route under your bar tape (at least one black tube that pops out of the bar tape) you should be able to install interrupt brakes/ cross levers. I'm not sure if it would help, but you should also be able to shorten the reach to the lever on your existing Sora shift/brake levers and that may put the levers in a more comfortable position. Additionally, a good quality dual pivot caliper brake with decent quality brake pads can do a lot to inspire confidence in your braking 

after I'm having a very hard time finding more useful images, but some more brands that I know employ end caps (feel free to edit): 

A curious finding is that a difference of 1 bar (14psi) makes more of a difference that a 5mm tire change. I suppose the problem becomes that with a 23mm tire there is only so much room for compliance. Additionally, they found that tire width had very little effect on small bumps (8mm in this test) and that the main factor was tire pressure: 

for thru axles, the axle is separate and should be included with your frame, the end caps simply provide the mating surface to the frame/axle. 

This can vary a good bit based upon the brand, quality of bicycle sold, and the agreement reached between the shop/brand. In general more volume=better deal, higher end=lower markup percentage (but higher dollar amount as the overall cost is higher as well). A high margin would be 40-45% (66-80% markup), low end would be around 20% margin (25% markup) in my experience (as an employee). so for a $500 bike a 40% margin is $200, $300 original cost to the shop. In markup terms, a $500 bike that costs $300 wholesale is 200/300 = 66% markup. Keep in mind this is not profit. Many bikes take an hour or more of labor to assemble, and this is before factoring in base costs of space, utilities, tools, etc. 

left: drive plate, right: fixed plate What truly sets this apart is the ring drive mechanism. This is accomplished via helical grooves on the freehub body, which engage the drive plate. As torque is applied to the freehub, this forces the two plates together. As more torque is applied, the plates are forced together more strongly, effectively eliminating slipping or skipping. 

That article also links to another article which discusses the sensation of tire stiffness as an expression of hoop stress, which they call casing tension. To me, this seems like a much more logical explanation as to why a wider tire will feel stiffer at a given pressure (again agreeing with @Daniel). I would suggest reading the article, but I did my best to briefly explain the end result. Essentially, the equation for hoop stress is based upon wall thickness, diameter, and pressure. 

There is a very basic animation here that shows the action of the ratchet plates. Upgrading and servicing One of the biggest advantages of this system is the ease with which you can upgrade, replace, or service the ratchet plates. This is actually a tool-free repair! The most basic DT Swiss hubs include an 18t ratchet plate, offering 20 deg engagement. This can be upgraded to a 36t (10deg) or even a 54t plate (6.67deg). This can be done to lower end DT wheels, so it is possible to take a less expensive wheel and gain a much higher engagement if desired. This also allows replacement of all contact surfaces (aside from the splines within the hub which are unlikely to wear or strip) to prolong the life of the hubs. 

American Classic Cam Plate Design The full name is "Six Pawl Cam Actuated Engagement System." This design is one of the more complicated ones, but according to American Classic provides a stronger freehub with relatively low resistance and causes all 6 double tooth pawls to engage simultaneously with high precision. Mechanism There are several parts to the engagement of this mechanism, listed in order of actuation from the chain/cog: 

This wire moves along the teeth of the cam plate as the wheel freewheels. If power is applied to the pedals, this wire forces a clockwise movement of the cam plate 

In a bicycle this design is typically inverted, the pawls are on the freehub body and they engage a toothed surface on the interior wall of the hub. 

After reading the answers here and becoming more curious, I found this article, which agrees with @Daniel. to briefly summarize it, they found that at the same tire pressure the narrower tires deflected more and had a lower stiffness (force over displacement) 

In general, regardless of the intended riding style/conditions, one of the biggest differences between inexpensive suspension and higher quality suspension is adjustability. A very cheap coil spring fork may only have "preload adjustment" (and this may not actually even do anything). Next tier suspension will usually be air sprung, so air pressure equates to preload and there would usually be a rebound adjustment. A single mode compression adjustment that affects low speed compression would be the next adjustment added. Still nicer suspension will include high and low speed compression adjustments, the more points the better (some will have 3 low speed settings while others will have many more). Higher quality seals and coatings to reduce friction/striction (kashima for fox and fastblack for rockshox) will also be an upgrade. Larger volume air chambers (particularly negative air chamber) will greatly increase the suppleness of the suspension and is usually found on higher quality suspension. Suspension without adjustments can perform just as well for many riders if properly tuned by the manufacturer. More adjustments means it can perform exactly the way you would like it to, even if that's not how the "average" rider might like it to perform. edit: there are exceptions to all of these not rules 

Star Ratchet and variations This design in it's simplest form is used by DT Swiss. This design incorporates easily replaceable ratchet plates that offer the added benefit of every engagement point transferring torque. A more complicated variation is what is used in Chris King hubs. Mechanism - DT Swiss 

142x12 axle and drive side end cap Excuse the question marks, but Prime is pretty sparse on details. It appears to be very similar to Novatec's configuration, which is shown in full here and is where I drew some inferences: 

This video below shows the action of the cam plate, the screwdriver is acting as the wire spring. This is another helpful video in which designer Bill Shook explains the mechanism. At ~0:33 you can see the whole mechanism in action via cutaway. Once the freehub moves more slowly than the wheel, the freehub body itself moves the pawls back into their retracted state as well as the cam plate. Advantages and Disadvantages Advantages 

just watch this video. I was looking at mountain bikes and feeling similar qualms, so I can't promise that road bikes will be quite as overdesigned. Wait til the end for the official Pinkbike "swing-a-carbon-frame-into-a-concrete-block" test. To that end, I have personally tried to smash a 1992 trek OCLV about a year ago (at that point 23 years old and pretty much abandoned at the shop I worked at) by applying the "swing-a-carbon-frame-into-a-concrete-block" test and it was by no means an easy task. yes, older carbon frames were probably more overdesigned than newer ones. 

As you can see they have a square baseplate that acts as a stop for the shifter. I had always just assumed it was some sort of French standard that didn't last very long. I have also seen simplex shifters that have a similar design. Often times I've found these frames have a different thread pitch than shifters designed for non French frames as well, making it extra difficult to mount another shifter. obviously a second, less than ideal option would be to use a clamp on shifter set lower on the downtube. thanks, France. 

refer to the lower half for the rear hub, although Prime never pictures any non drive side end caps. I do not believe this particular front hub works as pictured here. Other Systems Many companies are doing something similar now, all with their own little spin of course. They make a hub with oversized bearings that create some physical limit as to the maximum axle size, and then use caps to effectively shim the interior diameter and determine the final spacing of the hub. SRAM SRAM recently introduced their roam/rise/rail wheels which utilize end caps that pop in. SRAM also has some proprietary end caps for the front called torque caps that increase surface contact for increased stiffness (they claim).
