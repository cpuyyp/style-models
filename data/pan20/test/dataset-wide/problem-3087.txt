I believe three factors play to the rapidity with which the Allies acquired air superiority over the Axis: 

A white bread girl is of course a pampered suburban princess, while the Billy Joel's downtown man protagonist is clearly, by way of contrast, meant to also be brown-bread man. The metaphor stands for skin colour as well as economic means, and the derogatory euphemism of the phrase long predates the 1983 date on the song, such as in the famous insults tossed by Grant' Republicans towards Horace Greely in the 1872 Presidential campaign: 

The Great Bullion Famine, in mid-fifteenth century Europe, was a shortage of precious metals. It was largely driven by an unfavourable balance of trade with the Middle and Far East due to the shortage of goods, other than precious metals, with which to purchase goods such as spices, silk and cotton. 

This status continued under Frederick's heir Frederick William I and it wasn't until after his acquisition of West Prussia in 1772 that Frederick's grandson, Frederick William II the Great, first styled himself King of Prussia. 

Bombay/Mumbai is located just south of the "W" of Western Gatts; Calcutta at the west end of the Ganges river delta, just west of the modern India-Bangladesh border. Note also that the Indus River system could provide transport from the opium fields almost to Delhi (somewhat upstream from the "t" of Indo-Gangetic Plain), overland over very flat terrain between the two river systems, making the overland transport to Calcutta more than 95% by river barge/boat. Delhi is of course historically the great cross-roads of Northern India, being both easily defended and well situated near the shortest land route between India's two great river systems; and far enough north to be somewhat cooler than more southern locales. 

It is rumoured that on the evening of June 15, 1815, Marechal Ney may have enjoyed too much of M. Dumont's Burgundy in Gosselies, and that his late start to Quatre Bras the following morning may be in consequence: 

Casablanca is further from Tunis than London is from Berlin. Would you have regarded London in January 1943 as safe enough? The Vichy French had switched sides easily enough a two months earlier, so there was no realistic sense of domestic trouble in Casablanca, or French NW Africa. The premise that that German attack at the Kasserine Pass might have thrown the Allies out of NW Africa falls under the realm of alternative history; wasn't happening no-how, no-way. It caught completely green American recruits, under trained and under poor leadership, by surprise, and succeeded to a much greater extent than it truly had any right to. Churchill regularly proved his bravery during the Blitz, wandering around London at all hours of the day or night; he might easily have engaged in a caper such as you suggest. My belief is that Stalin, and Roosevelt at least through the 1944 election, regarded themselves as indispensable, and would thus not have put themselves in personal jeopardy. 

Growing up in the '60's, in towns of 20,000 to 40,000 people, I can attest that Baby Boomers had a freedom that kids today would never dream could exist. We walked to school every day, returned home for lunch, and wandered off for hours at a time on weekends and warm summer days. However, that freedom was closely guarded and protected by the ever-present eyes of someone's mother from every second house on every suburban street. Yes, women were generally less educated than men and consequently restricted to professions and jobs requiring less education. Once married, unless she had a college education and the support of her husband to do otherwise, a women's primary job became the care and nurture of her husband and children. 

Remember that it takes several times longer to typeset a page (by hand, as in 1776) than to hand-write it; and that the typesetter still requires a hand-written fair copy to set from. So you don't save any time by only typesetting the document - as it must be first written out fair for the typesetter. From Wikipedia on the Dunlap Broadside (my emphasis). 

The Martini is attested to from the 1888 Bartender's Manual, where there was a recipe for a drink that consisted of: 

Note that Western Europe suffered a massive deflation during and subsequent to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Exacerbating the (already long running) precious metal deficit with the East was the specie hoarding characteristic of deflation - a positive feedback loop. Feudalism is an indicator of this as monarchs resorted to paying retainers with land instead of specie, and tenants likewise paid rent with labour and commodity produce. All this while the precious metal mines of Europe were in decline. Flooding and the lack of technology to deal with it prevented mining deeper where the veins were still rich. Over the course of this millennium we see two significant upticks in economic activity, associated with two significant quantitative easings resulting from de-hoarding activities: 

After the Beer Hall Putsch of Nov. 8, 1923, the Nazi Party was banned in Germany (though it continued to operate clandestinely) until being refounded by Hitler in 1925. Thus although the swastika had been adopted as an emblem of the Nazi Party in 1921, during the time at which The Great Gatsby was written there would not have been a strong association with the Nazi Party. One should note that following the discovery of swastika representations during Heinrich Schliemann's excavation of Troy: 

Faithless Nelly Gray is a ballad composed by Thomas Hood (1799 - 1845), which roughly matches the time period in question. Two excerpts: 

Not much need for bootlegging that early in the 19th century. Whether the popularity of cocktails in the 1920's arose from the need or desire to hide foul liquor I cannot say; but the word was long established by that time. The Manhattan is attested to from William Schmidt's "The Flowing Bowl", published in 1891. In it, he details a drink containing: 

The size difference between a 12 lb cannon ball (heaviest field artillery of the time) and a 32 lb cannon ball (common siege artillery of the time) is, because mass varies as the cube of diameter, less than 2 inches: 4.5" to 6.25". The damage done by a cannon ball is performed by physically hitting, and penetrating and then tearing off, portions of the victim's body, or even by ripping a 6 inch hole right through armour and torso alike. (This is in fact very similar to a WW2-era armour-piercing round.) Note that because drag is proportional to the square of the radius, and mass to the cube, that for a larger shot with the same muzzle velocity, the range is greater because the deceleration due to drag is less: d ~ r^2 / r ^3 = 1/r. So a 6.25" diameter shot would have had roughly 35-40% greater (maximum) range than a 4.5" diameter shot for the same muzzle velocity. In order for a single such round shot to inflict more than a single casualty it must needs be fired so as to successively hit those additional targets after hitting the first. This was accomplished by firing the shot at a level, or very slightly elevated, angle so as to hit and skip over the ground with both minimal time and elapsed distance at a height in excess of 5 or 6 feet. Field guns of this era, firing at soft targets, were not aimed in any sense of the word but were rather leveled to fire their shot horizontal to the ground. While a battery of guns would be pointed roughly in the same direction, the need or even the desire to aim exactly did not exist - the beneficial cross-fire effect of slightly mis-aligned guns in a battery was well appreciated by artillerymen. When the guns were being laid chocks would be set marking the placement of the carriage wheels, and after each firing the gun would simply be rolled up to the chocks again; cleaned with the damper, loaded and fired. There was no need or desire to aim or even to re-lay the gun with any frequency. Beside which the thick smoke from the black powder would have made such futile. The guns would only have been re-laid during a substantial pause in firing when clearing of the smoke permitted such. Therefore, for siege guns employed as field artillery in a circumstance such as you envision, the main differences in battle effect would have been: 

This Answer from Hansard also discusses British Officer's Pay during World War II, in regard to the chart above: 

During the time period from the fall of Constantinople in 1453 until it's dissolution in 1918, the Ottoman Empire was pre-occupied with the Balkans, Middle East, and North-East Africa. During the height of the Age of Exploration the Ottoman Empire was very successfully expanding into the Balkans, besieging Vienna in 1529 under Suleiman the Magnificent and being repulsed in 1683 at the Battle of Vienna when attempting to do so again. The Lower Danube valley and Anatolia were the powerbase of the Ottomans, , and until after the battle of Vienna in 1683 their army was respected, even occasionally feared, by the Christian states of Western and Central Europe. Remember that one of the motivations for finding alternate routes to the Indies was the fearsome power of the Ottoman Empire that dominated the lands around Eastern Mediterranean even after the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. As for the Barbary States, they were independent slave-trading city states much more akin to the Hanseatic League than to any of the new nation-states that emerged in Western Europe during the Renaissance. Their interests and profits simply did not extend beyond the coastal waters of the Southern Mediterranean and South-Eastern North Atlantic which they dominated for several hundred years. 

Any substantial reform of the endemic corruption engaged in by both major parties, from Atlanta to the Pecos, would most likely of resulted in vastly larger number of Blacks being able to vote. Prior to the Civil Rights era ushered in during the Kennedy administration, this was not a result desired by either party (in the South). In consequence, neither party was much interested in reforming the corruption, just in making political capital of catching the other side out from time to time. 

The Big Lie was a technique and phrase (German: Große Lüge) coined and described by Adolph Hitler in Mein Kampf in 1925. (My emphasis) 

10 gunboats mounting 60 guns, howitzers and Maxims 9 batteries of field artillery mounting 64 guns, howitzers and Maxims Lee Metford and .303 Lee Enfield rifles capable of up to 10 rounds/minute in skilled hands with a range of 2800 yards 

Update: Note also that the large number of electrical utility companies operating in NYC at that time did not (in general) give customers a wide choice. By the nature of DC technology, the range from each generating station (of this type) was only about a mile, so potential customers had to select the nearest station. More choice was potentially available to AC customers, due to the technology's greater distribution range, but you still had to choose an operating company that was already in your neighbourhood, or pay the extremely large capital cost of financing the erection of utility poles. 

Churchill goes on in that chapter with extensive quotations from Parliament's debate on May 19 [1939] directly addressing the need to form a binding mutual-defense pact with the Soviet Union before Germany did, in order to secure British and French interests in Eastern Europe, in regards to both Poland and Rumania. Both his own and Lloyd George's words are featured prominently. To conclude the chapter, Churchill notes that, following Molotov's speech on May 19th in rebuttal to Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons earlier that day:
