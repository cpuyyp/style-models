Having studied how the moon might impact humans, I think I can give you some insights. Taking from a biological perspective, the moon does indeed affect animals: $URL$ From this, some creatures set particular biological processes, such as the coral reef's reproduction, on the full moon. Furthermore, the moon has a weak magnetic field: $URL$ And the moon is impacted by the earth's magnetotail when it is behind the earth (which has the best odds of also being a full moon, facing the sun): $URL$ My own personal theory is the moon affects magnetite found in the human brain: $URL$ Magnetite in the human brain: $URL$ So from this, we could speculate that the moon affects a particular biological process, in that, in distorting or interacting with earth's magnetotail it has a knock on effect on the magnetic field of earth, causing the magnetite in the human brain to effectively change, which in theory triggers things like headaches. From a fiction perspective, you can then argue that such a change causes people to become angry, or mad (it's where we get the word 'lunatic' from: lunar), which causes them to become werewolf-esque in behaviour. In terms of physical changes, it'd be harder to justify, and you'd have to suspend any sort of hard sci-fi approach here. You could argue the magnetic field causes the DNA to transform (mostly affecting the exposed outer skin), which starts a few days before the full moon and slowly disappears a few days after. But you could go hard sci-fi and have the person act like a werewolf. Their rage triggering adrenaline would enhance their strength, which again, superhuman strength isn't unheard of: $URL$ But obviously a physical transformation would be a step too far in a hard sci-fi. You could make it that the DNA or genes (perhaps modified by a retrovirus or even parasite?) makes the person noticeably hairier and stronger, but it would assume a permanent fixture rather than an instantaneous change. 

(4) Microwave and radio cloak (4.1) Emission. Trivial to avoid. (4.2) Reflection. It is not that hard to prevent reflection of microwave and radio sources. The reason for this, its because their wavelengths are sizes we are costumed to (from meters to centimeters). By choosing the right geometry in your ship, to reduce RADAR cross section at maximum you can, you will avoid reflection. (4.3) Transmission. This is ideal, as we said. Thus we need to transmit the maximum we can. But it is somewhat hard to transmit radio signal, precisely because their wavelength is big. There are few ways of doing this. 

(7) What we need. (7.1) Geometry. Making things in the right geometry to reduce radar cross section and be invisible by radio and microwave. Maybe a fractal pattern. Or something to make the waves cancel out. I don't know. (7.2) Infrared and Visible light transmission. We need to perfectly redirect the infrared and visible sources as if we are not there. This is proving to be quite difficult with our current technology level. (7.3) Black body Radiation. Following (5.1), we need to make sure enemy does not receive our black body radiation. If you have hypothetical material that nicely does (7.2), then it will not heat up (since there is no conduction, no convection, only heating by irradiation in space, and (7.2) transmits everything, not heating it up). After some time, it will be as cold as environment. Since at principle you know where the enemy is, you can transform inside-ship black body spectrum into unidirectional beam, and waste it away not pointing the beam at enemy. That way, you remain undetectable, and you have successfully dissipated your waste heat. 

There does not appear to be a discernible male of the species. Question: How would evolution cause these creatures to come into existence? 

Make it a sand hurricane. Have a massive storm that is fueled by the jet stream flowing into an area and spinning perpetually, having nowhere to go. Keep the sand trapped in this area, spinning with the (mostly) trapped wind. 

In DND, the displacer beast is using magic. The magic in particular is appearing to be where it was a second ago, meaning that where it is right now is a different spot. So, if you are willing to accept magic in return for a magical question, it is appearing behind in time a second or two. In this unvoted answer's defense, you didn't say that wasn't a legal answer. Real creatures, if you have a magical mind, as some here do, may very well implement fun magicks. 

Could you see it with the naked eye, assuming 1 molecule by 1 meter by 2 cm, made of a typically visible solid element or compound? What could you make it from, assuming our current non-theoretical knowledge of elements and alloys, in order to last the longest? 

Evolution is like culture. Separate things, they change. Just look at Darwin's exploration. Different islands, different birds. The biggest variable here is time. 500 years won't prolly cut it, however, if one species is living on Mars, as you said, then they would probably want to adapt to Mars climate. More cold resistance could make reproduction different to a feasible degree. Lighter gravity means a lighter bone structure, and taller people. Given maybe 1000 years, they would almost certainly be different species. One would be redder, taller, more cold resistance, and more impact resistant, but only by a small amount. The other would be us. But they'd work together just fine for a long while. 

(5) Infrared cloak (5.1) Emission. This is terribly hard to avoid. Our ship emit infrared radiation because of black body radiation, which mostly fall into the infrared, using Wien's law. ) According to Wien's displacement law: $\lambda = b/T$, where $b$ is Wien's constant. If we decrease the temperature to shift from infrared to microwave, your temperature would need to be unfeasible low. In addition, you must radiate waste heat, if you plan the ship inhabitants/computers/equipments to survive. To effectively cloak our selves, we need to make sure enemy does not receive our black body radiation. (5.2) Reflection. Hard Hard Hard. We cannot reflect from other infrared emissions if we plan to be undetected. (5.3) Absorption. If we absorb, we must be careful with the shadow cast problem, so you cannot be in between infrared sources and your target. This is very hard in star systems. And hard in open space (since stars of course do emit infrared, and they are everywhere). Absorption only is dangerous and risky. If we plan a good cloak, we cannot absorb. There is only one left: We must transmit. (5.4) Transmission. Here we are. Its a must. If we transmit, we avoid active and passive detection. Our biggest problem is cast shadow: There is continuously emitting infrared source $S$, and enemy ship. We are in the middle. If the transmission is perfect, light from source will pass thru us if we didn't existed. If there is a delay, may be detectable if we are moving at an certain speed or higher. If it is not perfect (likely), there might be distortions in the transmitted light, and aberrations. If enemy calibrate their scans, they might detect this distortions/aberrations, and move to investigate (or perhaps to simply shoot at it, just in case). 

Advanced civilization wants stuff! 0 gravity is nice No fuel required to float around in orbit. Only to move between bits. Less spread The bits are easy to identify and decide upon, being only meters apart in some places. We need rocks Advanced civilizations need more materials, and presuming they're in the area... Water Guess how much ice there is. Lots. Guess who wants it. People in space. It won't really run out There's a lot of the stuff. Verdict: Do it! 

In my universe, which I am starting far away from this one, I have a planet of humans. Regular humans. On a planet identical to earth. (So no "magic" answers.) I want these people to associate the smell of lavender with violent, dirty, or otherwise 'wrong.' Whenever there is a crime or if for some reason someone wants to advertise a crime, they dump lavender oil in the area, and people know that something is bad. This has a multitude of purposes. Question: How do you make (however you please, within the bounds,) a smell associated with wrong? 

I do potentially have an answer to how this planet might function, however. If we distance the planet from its sun, and then provide heat not through sunlight but rather through a very thin crust over an extremely hot mantle, we might be able to sustain life with geothermal energy. In the case that there is sufficient heat on both sides, it might be possible for the whole planet to contain life. On the light side, we have photosynthetic flora, light-loving reptiles with cold blood as you described, and other bright and happy things that we archetype as "good guy stuff", like light elves. On the dark side, we find fungi, warm blooded creatures that are hardy enough to survive the potentially still much lower temperatures, and not much color or other enjoyable features to speak of. And this, finally, is where we must decide how these "elves" could exist on both sides. On a planet with any real extremes, it would be quite difficult to explain how a cold-blooded creature would have any reason to exist on the dark side of a planet, or why a warm-blooded one would want to live on the light side. I propose that the elves are one uniform race living on a planet that is life-sustaining as I described equally well on both sides, and that the only reason they split is over moral or religious issues. Any heavy adaptation would occur over the course of innumerable years, especially because to look anything alike, this race must have a common ancestor which was neither light nor dark elf, bur rather some sort of neutral elf. One race's physiology couldn't be wildly different from the other, such as the difference between warm and cold-blooded creatures, because doing so would create two kinds of animal too different to both be called "elves". 

(6) Visible Light. (6.1) Emission. Trivial to avoid. Just shut down all the lamps in the outer-hull. (6.2) Reflection. We cannot reflect from other visible light emissions if we plan to be undetected (6.3) Absorption. Same argument for infrared. If we plan a good cloack, we cannot absorb visible light. (6.4) Transmission. Here we are. Its a must. And same argument of infrared applies to visible light. 

(1) How enemy might detect us (1.1) Active. This is the active way of detecting. Enemy will emit some signal. This signal will interact with the hull. Iff hull reflects, then the enemy will pick up the signal. Analysis of the signal will identify our position, our speed, and possibly more data about us. (1.2) Passive. This is a passive way of detecting. Enemy will not emit a signal, at all. Enemy will just listen for signals. If we emit a signal, enemy will detect us. If we reflect from signal emitted by someone else (say.. sun.. or another ship), enemy will detect and gather data about us. (1.3) Cast Shadow. Other sources emit signals continuously at all directions. Say.. The sun. If the enemy is looking at sun, and their sensors detect the sun stopped transmitting its light in some small dot! Since the source emit continuously by hypothesis, conclusion is something is in between the sun and enemy ship. Something has been detected. Detection of cast shadow might be done with light of stars, sun, continuous radio emissions, etc.
