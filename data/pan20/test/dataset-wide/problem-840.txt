The analogy is false. Neutron stars consist mainly of neutrons, with a small fraction of protons and electrons in equal numbers. The fraction is density dependent, but is in the range 1%-10%.$^{*}$ Neutron stars are so-named because neutrons dominate both by mass and number. A "normal" star consists of about 75% Hydrogen and 23% Helium and 2% heavier elements (by mass; the fraction varies with age, mass and initial chemical composition). Most of this material is completely ionised, so the hydrogen is in the form of protons and an equal number of electrons. Whilst protons (just) dominate the mass, you cannot call it a proton-star because there are equal numbers of electrons. Actually, because of the contribution from ionised helium and heavier elements there are more free electrons than there are free protons. $^{*}$ Neutron stars also have a crust of neutron-rich nuclei (along with enough electrons to balance their charge), but that is a small fraction in terms of their mass and in terms of particle numbers, so is unimportant to this argument. 

There are (at least) three main methods to detect planets that orbit so that the orbital plane is at right angles (or thereabouts) to our line of sight. The first of these is direct imaging. This is already responsible for the discovery of a number of planets. However, in order to be visible against the glare of their host star, the exoplanets need to be in wide orbits and be massive. It also favours the detection of giant planets around young stars, since these planets are still contracting, are still warm, and emitting their own infrared light. A list of about 20 directly imaged exoplanets can be found here; arguably some of these should more rightly be called brown dwarfs. A second method is the so-called astrometric detection of exoplanets. This works because the star and planet orbit their common centre of mass. This means that the star executes an orbit with the same period as the exoplanet, but with a semi-major axis that is smaller by the ratio of the planet mass to the star mass. This motion of the star can be detected, in a similar way to which parallax is measured, by precise measurement of position with respect to background objects. The method is most sensitive to wider binaries and massive stars, but is limited by the requirement to see appreciable motion of the star within the duration of the observational dataset. In practice then, this means it is difficult to detect planets with orbital periods of decades, unless one is prepared to wait for some time! There may only be one accepted exoplanet discovery by this method so far (HD 176051b), but the Gaia satellite should be capable of detecting many thousands of exoplanets with masses at or above that of Jupiter and with orbital radii of about 1--10 au (see Perryman et al. 2004). Thirdly, gravitational microlensing is quite insensitive to the plane of the orbit. This works when a foreground object gravitationally lenses and magnifies the light from a background star. An exoplanet is marked by a "blip" in the lensed light curve. There are also about 20 planets detected by microlensing. The disadvantage of this technique is that the event is a non-repeatable one-off, so not much more can be learned about these systems. Notably, all three of these techniques are less sensitive to planets that have small mass (as indeed are transit experiments and the radial velocity technique). However, whilst small planets (in terms of mass) have been found by microlensing, it seems unlikely that the other two techniques will discover Earth-like planets for quite some time. 

Arguably, "rogue planets" have already been discovered by direct imaging. Giant planets when first formed are big and hot. They radiate their own light, mostly in the infrared. So young isolated planets can be seen directly. There have been various claims in the literature that objects as small as a few Jupiter masses have been identified in young star forming regions. See various papers by the IAC brown dwarf research group $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ These claims are open to criticism - sometimes it is hard to tell whether a faint object really belongs to the star forming region observed, rather than being an unassociated background object. The claimed masses also depend heavily on models for the luminosity-mass relation as a function of age, and the ages of these objects are not easily constrained. Nevertheless it would not be surprising if, in the maelstrom of the formation of a cluster of stars, some planetary systems were stripped from their parent stars by close encounters with other objects. The chances of seeing older, isolated, planetary mass objects are slim, but microlensing appears to be the only technique presently available. The microlensing signature of a free-floating planet is of course unrepeatable so a discovered planet could not be followed up in any way. However, surveys of microlensing events could be a way of saying something statistically about how common such objects are. See for example $URL$ EDIT: It is also worth noting that the whether these things really are "planets" at all is disputed. They could either be genuine planets, formed in the same way that is hypothesised for most giant planets - that is by accretion onto a rocky core that formed around a star. They could then have been displaced from their parent star by dynamical interactions with other bodies in their system or with a third body. As I said above, N-body simulations do predict that this will happen (e.g. Liu et al. 2013). On the other hand they could represent the very lowest mass gas fragments that are able to form during the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud and that for some reason were unable to accrete further gas (i.e. they are really more like low-mass brown dwarfs). This so-called "fragmentation limit" is of order 10 Jupiter masses, but if it were a little lower it might explain the free-floating planets that have been seen so far. 

Go to the Kepler/K2 MAST database $URL$ or $URL$ Search on a temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) range: e.g. for K-stars 4500 .. 5200 A (big) list of objects will be found and presented to you in a table. Mark the ones you want (all the Kepler objects should have available data, but not all the K2 ones will unless you limit your search to the earlier K2 campaigns) and then click on the "submit marked data for retrieval from STDADS" It will then ask you to confirm that you want to download the data with various options to get at the data and a tick box list of what you want (including light curves). Then once you've got the data you need to look at the FAQ and descriptions of data format etc. that can be found at the main Kepler archive pages $URL$ If on the other hand you just want to look at the light curves then you can do that without downloading the data by clicking on "plot marked light curves" on the search results page. 

I think it is incorrect to call this object a "free floating planet", or at least it is not clear at all that it is. The mass of the object is based on (a) evolutionary models of the luminosity-mass relationship and (b an assumed age for the beta Pic moving group. The first point gives at least factors of two uncertainty in the claimed mass. The second point contains (in my view) a systematic error in that the authors have used an outdated age of 12Myr for the beta Pic group. It has been revised (by myself and others) to about 21-24 Myr. This would make the estimated mass about 30-50% higher and so it would be $\geq 10$ times the mass of Jupiter and could easily be at a deuterium burning mass. As far as an "orbit" goes, as this object is unassociated with another star directly, but is probably part of a co-moving kinematic group (the Beta Pic moving group), it will share the orbit of that group around our Galaxy. 

I can't comment in detail but Earth-Moon-Earth communication at radio wavelengths is well established. At wavelengths longer than a few cm (frequencies below 10 GHz), the Moon appears smooth and acts like a reflective sphere as far as radio waves are concerned. 

Short answer: The Sun will lose about half of its mass on the way to becoming a white dwarf. Most of this mass loss will occur in the last few million years of its life, during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. At the same time the orbital radius of the Earth around the Sun will grow by a factor of two (as will the outer planets). Unfortunately for the Earth, the radius of the Sun will also reach to about 2 au, so it will be toasted. There is the possibility that the decreased binding energy and increased eccentricity of the Earth and the outer planets will lead to dynamical instabilities that could lead to planetary ejection. This is highly dependent on the exact time dependence of the late, heavy mass loss and the alignment or otherwise of the planets at the time. Long answer: Stars with mass less than about 8 solar masses will end their lives as white dwarfs on a timescale which increases as their main sequence initial mass decreases. The white dwarfs that are formed are of lower mass than their progenitor main sequence stars, because much of the initial mass of a star is lost through stellar winds (particularly during the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase) and final ejection of a planetary nebula. Thus, the current distribution of white dwarf masses, that peaks between $0.6$ and $0.7 M_{\odot}$ and with a dispersion of $\sim 0.2 M_{\odot}$, reflects the final states of all main sequence stars with $0.9 <M/M_{\odot}<8 M_{\odot}$, that have had time to evolve and die during our Galaxy's lifetime. The most reliable information we have about the relationship between the initial main sequence mass and final white dwarf mass (the initial-final mass relation or IFMR) comes from measuring the properties of white dwarfs in star clusters of known age. Spectroscopy leads to a mass estimate for the white dwarf. The initial mass is estimated by calculating a main sequence plus giant branch lifetime from the difference between the age of the star cluster and the cooling age of the white dwarf. Stellar models then tell us the relationship between main sequence plus giant lifetime and the initial main sequence mass, hence leading to an IFMR. A recent compilation from Kalirai (2013) is shown below. This shows that a star like the Sun, born with an initial mass of $1M_{\odot}$ (or maybe a per cent or two more, since the Sun has already lost some mass), ends its life as a white dwarf with $M = 0.53 \pm 0.03\ M_{\odot}$. i.e. The Sun should lose approximately 50% of its initial mass in stellar winds and (possibly) planetary nebula ejection. 

Accretion of material from Venus is a different matter. The required ejection velocities are higher because the escape velocity for Venus 10.4 km/s. But more importantly, drag in the dense Venusian atmosphere would prevent anything emerging from the planet with anything like these speeds. 

$URL$ A particularly important example that is a landmark in dark matter research is the Bullet Cluster. This is actually two clusters that appear to have collided and passed through each other about 150 million years ago. The distribution of galaxies in the clusters can be seen in optical images; the hot gas can be traced by X-ray observations and the dark matter is traced by looking at the lensed images of distant background galaxies. The key image is shown below - it illustrates the distribution of optical galaxies, the X-ray-emitting hot gas (pink/red) and the inferred distribution of dark matter (blue). As the clusters move through each other, the hot gas interacts and piles up into bow-shocks that are displaced from the distribution of optical galaxies. On the other hand, the dark matter, which is thought to consist of non-baryonic, non-interacting particles remains centred on the visible galaxies and each dark matter "cloud" has apparently passed through the other with no interaction occuring. The displacement between the hot gas and the majority of the gravitating matter, that is dark, is very strong evidence for a non-baryonic particle description of dark matter, rather than some of the alternatives to dark matter like Modified Newtonian Dynamics.
