Endurance and power in curling are important during the sweeping action, and I can guarantee that after a match the players are tired (especially the two players who sweep more). Here some evidence that talk about player training methods where you can find how physical training and endurance are important: 1 - 2 - 3 Furthermore, being able to maintain concentration fot all the match is a very important aspect and I think that some doping can "help" for it Anyway the use of doping is breaking the rules of every sport (but this do not answer to the question) 

If the contract in ending the player is free to sign to another team just at the end of the contract to another team (see free player Antonio Cassano moving to Sampdoria in summer '15).

Nadal has won his 10th title on clay of Montecarlo, is this a record for winning of a single tennis tournament?

The answer is NO. To be precise this particular case is not treated but the regulation is clear, and is it often possible to view the striker to arrange the mark area with the shoe to make it easier for the shot From the FIFA rules of the game about position of the ball (law 14 at page 45) says The ball: • must be placed on the penalty mark The player taking the penalty kick: • must be properly identified The defending goalkeeper: • must remain on his goal line, facing the kicker, between the goalposts until the ball has been kicked. The players other than the kicker must be located: • inside the field of play • outside the penalty area • behind the penalty mark • at least 9.15 m (10 yds) from the penalty mark 

When the gates are placed in position "perpendicular" to the descent is easier to understand the succession of the gates, but it can happen that the gates are placed in a "parallel" way to the descent and in this case the skier has to turn close to them. When two ports are very close succession of uses "double" term to describe this figure as if it is three doors in close succession using the term "triple" (this is a translation from Italian language). From the logical point of view there are no differences from the "perpendicular" tracking, but visually understanding is more difficult. 

How does the rankings works in the boxing associations (WBA, WBO, WBC ... )? How can a boxer improve his rankings? 

When the cross is kicked there are no players in offside. Then the goalkeeper deflects the ball over the bar (or the ball arrive directly over the bar), and in this moment (if the video screenshot is at the right moment) there is only a player in offside (near the left bar of the goal "numer 1"), but this player is a not-active position. So the player that score the goal (number 3) is in a regular position for offside rule because the last defender is over (number 2). In my opinion watching the video is more easy to understand than looking the screenshot 

Those atletes won olympic medals under different flags: Josefa Idem get married with an italian and get nationality in 1992 

Chicago victory after 108 years (1908 to 2016) is the longest pause between two titles considering the major American sportleagues (NBA-NFL-NHL-MLB)? 

As suggested in the comments it depends on what tournaments are you writtend about. i.e. Italian Serie A the player will be disqualifie after the 5th yellow cards (since last tournaments it was at the 4th). The second disqualification will be at the 10th yellow cards, then at the 14th, then at the 17th, then at the 19th, then every yellow card collected in that tournament (see the art 19 comma 9 and the box in the image below in italian language) 

Tickets are not available because it is too early for the buy. You can try to buy them few days before or that day at the stadium. I am almost sure that Milan-Carpi will not sign the sold out

Euro 2016 is open to 24 teams while since 2012 was to 16 when the firsts and the seconds teams qualify for the knockout rounds. This expansion required a modification to the first round of the qualification system and those are the criteria for the qualification: 

This is the list of medals that will be awarded during the paralympics games in Rio in 2016 by sports. From this list it is deduced that for some sports we have more disability categories grouped within the same competition (for example Cycling Road - Men's Road Race C1-2-3) for most instead athletes with different types of disability will have separate classifications. To confirm this I can link the medal table for Men's 1500 metres from London 2012 Summer Paralympics as commented above by Philip Kendall. 

What would be an estimate of costs for a season for a young (15-18 years) tennis player who wants to play only in Europe circuit? Excluding revenue (sponsors / prize), what about the costs: transfers, accommodation (2 * / 3 * hotels), equipment, tournaments, training I hypothesize transfers of 2/3/4 tournaments each to be repeated 2 or 3 times during the year with a coach or a parent in tow

It often happened that when a rugby player arrive with no pressure opponents try to take the oval to the center of the in-goal area. The try is taken when the player enter in the in-goal area, so I do not understard why the players continue to run in this directions

The NBA sets aside a playoff’s pool of money as a bonus to teams for their performance. Last year that figure was at $13 million with a maximum of $8 million that can go to any team. This year the prize money seems confirmed. If you were to divide that figure equally to all players in the team that would equate to each player receiving a maximum over $500,000. This is the source If the players divide the prize money in percentage of thier wage the bonus can be very different and here you can find a simulation on Warriors players (made before the end of the season) Individual players may then have economic advantages with successive contracts, but in this case it is not about bonuses.

Leave the court for a break is not expected during tennis matches even if the previous set was very long. It can happened that a very long match is interrupped by the umpire because of the hours (see Isner-Mahut match details) Different from what are you asking is the break ask by the tennis player because of a little injury (eg blisters) or to go to the toilet 

Thinking of a traditional shot from the baseline, if the player has enough time to be able to hit the ball after the rebound in a higher position or lower one, what are advantages and disadvantages in the next shot? 

In England is FA Community Shield, in Italy Supercoppa, in Spain Supercopa, in Germany Supercup and so on This title existe for every FIFA league or just only some league? 

use it without net except during official games, on these occasions you should assemble and dismantle the net with a consequent loss of time add wheels to completely remove the goal frames at the end of matches/trainings use rigid net (it is easy to see it on 3 vs 3 ground, but I do not know if exists for normal goal frames)

The sticks are curved to better adapt to the type of shot before and during the hit. The curvature in fact depends on the type of handle and the single-player (the bat is considered an extension of the arm). You can find those kind of curve:

Top players position (32 for Grand Slam Tournaments) are determined by official rankings then other players who enter directly in the main draw are drawn. So is it possible that the 33rd players (if all the first 32 take part to the Grand Slam) is raffled to play the first round versus draw numer 1. Here the video of the draw of Australian Open 2016 This rule applies to every tournaments, Grand Slam and minor ones. In the main draw there are also free slot assigned by tournaments directors (Wild Cards) and for qualifing. Tennis players that do not enter directly in the main draw for rankings can play the qualification. The qualification draws are managed in the same way. In Auckland 2016 draw you can see that the "last" tennis player direct acceptance (no qualification needed) in Mariana Duque-Marino (ranking 78th), there are 4 slot for qualification players and 2 Wild Cards. In the past was the ranking rules was not followed so closely: maybe there are players strong on grass and weak on clay so there where a bit of adjustments, but this way generate many controversy so now it is followed the "rankings rules". 

How is it possible to minimize wind effects playing beach tennis between two players? I mean what positions can be suggested for the "strongest" and the "weakest" player? Lateral wind for each players or wind blowing the back/front of the strongest player? Or another solutions? 

UEFA competitions used to disqualified the players after 3 yellow cards in 3 different matches, than after the 5th, the 7h (see art 49 and the image below) and so on until the semi-final.

During a session of free swimming into italian public pool is good practice to occupy always the right side of the lane. I do not know if it is related to the way of driving car. In Country like UK, Australia and Japan, where you drive at the left, is there a common behaviour? Which side you tend to swim if you have to share the lane with other athletes?

This is the wikipedia page that explain asian handicap betting. In a case of multiple bet you have to calculate in this way: 

Does it exists in biathlon a sort of ethical code that prevents the athlete to leave a race even if the final results is very compromised? In the today Mass Start (16 gen 2016 in Ridnaun-Val Ridanna) Bjorndalen has 2+3+2+3 error for the 4 sessions. I do not think that the points raised in today's race from Bjornadalen can be important for general or specialty rankings so I do not understand why he is not leave after the 2nd / 3rd lap. It is not a good show to view the most important biathlete of ever to run alone in the last position I was wondering if withdraw during the race was seen as a lack of respect for the public or for other competitors

It is possible, but not recommended to change the attacks on cross-country skis. The holes of sns attacks ("Salomon") are in a different position from the attacks nnn ("Rottefella"), then you should first fill the holes with cylindrical woods plugs (watch out the dimensions) and glue. After the ski is like the original situation you can mount new bindings. For epoxy resin now there are solutions to be used even without solvent, only after it is mounted leave it to dry for a long time in hot, dry conditions Obviously if you can go to a professional you have more possibility to get a well done job 

I think, but I am not sure on it, that is an historical reason. America has a long history with Indi Racing League, Champ Car, Nascar, drag races and so on, so mostly of american people follow this races. So it is probably a choose taken after a cost-benefit analysis. But recently the is a non-lucky US team that try this adventure: US F1 

As written in the comment is not clear what do you mean with "most popular". I can try to reply to the question whinking about popularity like attendance. So according to those sources (guardian and Australian Bureau of Statistics) Australian (rules) Football seems the "most popular" sport in that country. The sources not agreed on all data, but it seems that this sport is the top on both the rankings. On other hand the sport with most players seems football.
