I have joined as a team lead in a new company but yet no reportees are assigned to me . In this company timelines and accuracy of response to client are very important as compare to my previous organizations as client is technical and very strict. Work pressure is high in my current project and team members normally work for 12-14 hours to complete their daily task. Now, as I am new to this project I need help from others to get my work done but as I said team members are too busy with their work that they normally execuse me by saying that they also don't know about that and you need to find out it by your own or they give very short answer for my questions which don't lead to any understanding for me and becomes really difficult for me to how to ask next questions again for more clarification. With this my personality is that I found it difficult to ask questions to other and their such behavior are creating worst situation for me. As I have IT experience of more than 8+ years my project manager is expecting me to deal this situation by my own and expect from me that I should know how to get help from others. Kindly help me to deal with this situation as I want to know how to improve my way of asking question that will lead others to answer my question even in their busy schedule or is there any specific way of asking questions to others which triggers others to help me 

How's that different from you asking your boss: "are you planning to lay me off or fire me?" or being asked about your religion during an interview? I've been in places where management constantly talks about how employees are their "greatest asset" only to lay them off in large numbers a short time later.. Alternatively, you could be up-front about the simple yes/no nature of the question: 

[EDIT-1]: She does have a 'backup' plan to negotiate some things if it comes to that, but that's different to knowing whether this is or isn't something that's even permissible to do by employer and, if so, how employees could/should handle the situation. [EDIT-2]: She just got out of the meeting, and they did take away her vacation/PTO. I've updated the question on this basis. 

I think other answers are very good, but I think what goes around comes around. Perhaps this person needs to receive a cup of his own medicine? Maybe you and/or your team members should feel offended at the fact that this person keeps feeling offended for trivial things and on someone else's behalf, and take the issue to HR? Who is he/she to feel offended when "Jeff", who is the target of the joke, didn't? That's just pretentious, to put it politely. On a more serious note, it's likely that HR is coming down on you hard because this easily-offended person is the only person making any noise (i.e. talking/complaining/reporting/etc). If you stay quiet and do nothing, you will pay the consequences later on because they may interpret that as you having "admitted" to being "offensive" by omission (e.g. not defending yourself). In fact, you don't even know what this person actually claimed behind your backs. This person is very unlikely to be trustworthy. (I've had to deal with difficult co-workers before, the "everyone's out to get them"-types, although it never got to HR in our team's case. Our team had tried to play "nicely", but they've been suffering the consequences of it for a long time now.) Instead, if you and/or the rest of your team report the situation to management and HR, then they may realize where the real problem actually is and, who knows, maybe even do something about it. To top it off, if/when HR comes down on this person, they might get everything they need out of this person's instant on-the-spot reaction. 

Creating the Job Description and passing that to HR Filtering the CVs after HR has filtered them. Conducting an Initial Telephonic interview. Being in the Interview Panel in the Face to Face on site interview. 

It was a government job. It was in a small town with a way lower cost of living. Candidates with my level of experience normal earn about Y (which is a good deal, about 60% more than X). 

Given that this has to do with Indian Conditions, let me answer that from the Indian HR perspective. You say that you have been working for 3 years, out of which you were on Maternity paid leave for 3 months, and unpaid maternity leave for 9 months (as per my understanding). In this case, the difference between 2 years of experience and 3 years of experience is substantial. So you should definitely mention this somewhere in your CV, as well as the forms you fill up stating your exact working experience, and not only your employment period. 

Very often, your current salary can be an irrelevant fact, but it can still serve as a baseline, for the company to make you an offer. I had taken up a government job, which was paying way below market level. I had taken it up, because I was getting burnt out in the corporate sector. When I decided to come back, and start applying, I always answered is as follows: Present Salary: It is X, but the number is irrelevant because of the following reasons: 

I'm an IT professional, who has worked in different positions, in different companies for the last 8 years. Since March, I've transitioned to an Independent Freelancing Consultant Role, where I provide consultancy to several Different organizations. What I mean by this, is that I'm not working at any one place full time. I might work for Company A for 15 hours/Week, Company B for 15 hours/Week & Company C for 10 hours/week. Some of the consulting Gigs are short term, about 2 months. To confirm, I've not founded, nor own any LLC or similar.
