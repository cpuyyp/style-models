As user19362 said, choice of clothing is very important when you are exercising. By wearing a jacket when the temperatures are elevated, your body will not dissipate heat as efficiently as it would if you were not wearing a jacket (sweating cools the body via evaporation, and you will be trapping the moisture under your jacket). This is not a good means for losing weight, although you may end up sweating more, you are losing water weight only, which is actually very important when you run - you need to stay hydrated! You could end up dehydrated, feeling faint, or suffer illnesses due to the heat. If you are looking to lose weight by running, given your other posts on the matter, ensure that you are eating healthily during the day (all meals), and ensure that, by running, you are producing a daily calorie deficit (burning more than you are taking in) - this means your body will start to burn other fuel sources (stored fat/sugars etc). However, this is not a message to cut back the food you eat - ensuring you have good daily nutrition is paramount. Do not be put off if you do not see results straight away - the loss of weight through exercise can be slow, but you need to stick at it to see results! All the best, I hope this has helped :) 

In terms of post-running nutrition, there are a lot of thoughts surrounding this - but there is one major theme, ensuring that you have carbohydrates to replace the energy you have used (refuelling), and protein for muscle repair (I can see that you already have eggs, and milk, which is good!). In terms of recovery, it is often touted that a 4:1 (or sometimes 3:1) carb:protein ratio is optimal, and that the protein should be consumed within an hour of finishing the run (as this is the time that it will have the most effect) - however, the body can only make use of so much protein per hour (based on your body weight), and different sources of protein act over different timescales (milk protein, for example, acts over a longer timescale than whey protein). Resources on websites such as RunnersWorld cover these topics. So, having established the composition of what you should be eating - it's a case of working out a good way of having a wholesome breakfast that incorporates this! As you run before breakfast, which naturally means your body is depleted, you must definitely ensure that you have carbs (porridge, etc) otherwise you may feel sluggish towards lunchtime as you increase your distance. Here is a nutrition section from RunnersWorld, $URL$ Here is an article for joint-health $URL$ Here is an article outlining the timings for protein intake $URL$ As you are just starting out running, these sorts of articles will help you on your way - I hope this helps, and all the best! 

According to guidelines from the ACSM, one set is enough for strength gains. Multiple sets do add greater gains, but the additional improvement per set is small. A longer article contains references to other studies showing that one set is as good as multiple sets. Note that the studies are all from 1995 - 1997. I'm a firm believer in doing 2 - 3 sets. However the first couple of sets are done at lighter weight (25% max, 50% max) as a warm-up. I then do 1 set of my max weight. 

I am a very overweight man at 400lbs (181 kg). I've been told by several doctors that I need to lose weight or else my health will get worse and worse. What exercises are safe for a large person? For weight training I'm wary of doing squats since every time I've tried I end up with sore knees and have problems walking. I've also found that most cardio programs have the same effect. For losing weight should I be concentrating on cardio or weight training? Is it better to exercise or should I just change my eating habits? What are some good websites for teaching myself proper nutritional information? I've heard the old adage "eat less", but considering that most of my meals are from fast food restaurants, I have no idea of what kinds or proportions of foods I should be eating. 

Since time seems to be a factor for your workouts, I'd suggest you switch to doing 2 sets. Do a warm-up set (50% of workout weight) followed by your workout set. 

Looking at the research, it appears that performing extra sets give quickly declining returns on investment. A very thorough research guide can be found at ExRx.net - Low Volume Training. Some interesting quotes from that guide: 

I found the Starting Strength method of squatting a good way to increase my squats. You do a 3x5 workout and add 5 lbs each session. Emphasis is on proper form. It's natural to hit a plateau as your body gets accustomed to the work you're doing. The solution to this is to do a reset: drop the weight by 10% and continue your workouts from there. You'll drive past the plateau in a couple of weeks. You'll end up plateauing again in the future, and can do the reset again. Once you've done two resets and stall again then you should be squatting considerably more and will have to look into a more advanced program. I have no advice there as I haven't reached that point yet. 

You should go with 3. Make sure to explain to the trainers why you want to follow that program. If they are dead-set against your using it, find out why they feel that way. If the trainer refuses to spot you and help correct your form, find another trainer. If none of the trainers at the gym are willing to do it, then find another gym. 

What you are experiencing is a phenomenon that is related to cardiac drift - whereby if you were to run at a constant pace, you would see your heart rate increase over the run. This is due to the stress experienced by the body with prolonged exercise. However, the alternative is that if you keep a constant heart rate, then you will see the pace come down in order to keep the effort the same. As you run, you start to deplete your muscles of glycogen, up to a point at which you may notice your heart rate increase markedly - signalling depletion. You can improve your performance, resulting in heart rate stability, by running aerobically - that is, at an easy, comfortable pace (less than 75% HRMax). This allows for your muscles to adapt, resulting in more economic running - which is reflected by a faster pace for a given HR. So, to an extent, you will always see a tail-off in pace, or an increase in HR, however consistent aerobic training will have a marked effect on stabilising your pace. 

Firstly, I understand that different runners react in different ways to training, and so a specific case cannot be made to each runner. When starting out running, there is a lot to be gained from incrementally increasing weekly mileage, eg going from 10 miles a week, to 20 miles a week. Generally, the improvement is brought about from the increase in cardio fitness, as well as the additional strength built up from the increased mileage. However, there must be a point at which the gains are very slight. Professional, or Olympic athletes, are known to train over 100 miles/week (I believe I read somewhere that Mo Farah's average week is ~120-130 miles). The top-end of non-professional athletes often train towards to 100 miles/week mark (although that must be tricky balancing work and training!). My question is; at what point does the performance improvement, brought about by the increased mileage, become marginal? Considering 3 popular race distances, 10km, Half Marathon and Marathon, and assuming an 80/20 (easy/hard effort) training load, with an easy long run taking ~30% of the weekly mileage. And, for context; As a 22-year old male, currently sitting just below 70% on the age-graded times for 5km, 10mi and Half Marathon, (18:28, 66:38, and 1:28:14 PBs respectively [no 10km raced recently]) I am considering upping my weekly training load from ~50km (31mi) to about 50mi over the course of 3 or so months, in order to attempt to head towards the 80% age-grade times for 5km, 10km and HM (16:08, 33:35, and 1:14:04, respectively). The HM PB was the result of a good 12-week training period over the summer (50km/week during and for ~6 weeks after), and the 10mi PB hit in November, however I broke my collarbone shortly after, and am restarting the training again.
