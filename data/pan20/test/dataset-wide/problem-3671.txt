If after a prolonged and successful period of working out there's a sudden lack of desire to continue, what is likely the most important factor? What change would turn things around? 

A day without running after consecutive days with running would be a break in the habit loop. Even if your habit is stated in your mind as "go running 5 times a week", that's what you believe the habit to be on a cognitive level, but subconsciously you've been conditioned to do this daily. So as a day passes without running the loop is broken and the impulse towards activity is lessened. The longer you wait, the further you are on the drop-off of the habit formation curve towards automaticity and it will once again take an act of willpower to start again. But upon successfully doing so you'll quickly move towards the previous level again; if you didn't wait too long you'll still be way better off than starting from scratch, and the downtime will in retrospect seem like a little hickup in what is otherwise a well-established habit. I think this might have some effect on that "wake-up" feeling you get when you go for a run when the lethargy is setting in. The positive effect on mood from re-establishing the habit loop would definitely have an uplifting effect. I know for one that if I spend a whole day lazing about inside watching YouTube, or spend the day going to the park, sitting in the sun and reading, the latter will leave me in a better mood and feeling more fullfilled and awake, despite both arguably having been "unproductive" leisure time. In your case that doesn't seem to cover the whole story, though, since you mention this is specific to running and in other activities like cycling the time off actually contributes to recovery and a new-found readiness to take up the activity again. So we'd need to dig into the physiological aspects. One possibility is that it is in fact a function of recovery. Namely, with the cycling you might be accumulating fatigue to the point where rest is needed after five consecutive days or you'll start seeing a negative return on investment (overtraining). Whereas with the running perhaps the applied volume and intensity is of a level you are already accustomed to, so without increasing these parameters recovery isn't as big a factor anymore and the habit formation becomes much more important. This article on Wikipedia investigates the neurobiological effects of exercise: $URL$ Of particular interest is the section "Psychological stress and cortisol". 

What you describe is most likely a fasciculation ($URL$ commonly known as a "muscle twitch". This is usually benign, but there can be more severe underlying conditions causing this. I know giving medical advice would be frowned upon here (especially by someone without a medical background) but we can't really go running to the doctor for every minor thing that can possibly be a symptom of something more severe, or you wouldn't ever get out of his/her office. So unless this is taking severe forms, lasts for a really long time, starts presenting itself with other weird symptoms or starts interfering with quality of life it's probably not something to be worried about. Electrolyte imbalances are often indicated as a possible culprit for muscle issues such as cramps, spasms and twitches. Especially magnesium is singled out as a possible cause for such twitching. You could try taking a magnesium supplement if you don't have any medical issues counter-indicating this. Regular supplement quantities of something like magnesium citrate are safe and it's an over-the-counter substance. Or you could go for dietary sources rich in magnesium, such as seeds and nuts, cocoa, chives and bananas. If it's a simple lack of magnesium this could solve it. I take a magnesium supplement daily in the evening as I find it helps sleep. My sleep went to crap when I was on a ketogenic diet, and I got heart palpitations; a lack of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and magnesium was most likely at least partially to blame for that, since things improved with higher intake. Also, if you happen to consume quite a bit of caffeine (could be in pre-workouts too) you might wanna cut back a bit. 

Megasaur has the perfect answer to your question about what it means to "condition the body". My answer below is meant to be supplementary. Regarding your question on the application of treading water, I can answer that since my water polo practices in high school required treading water as an exercise in itself. Have you ever tried to tread water for 5-10 minutes without stopping? It can tire the legs very fast. It has a similar effect as doing leg squats. Your legs will feel numb after several minutes if you're not used to it. Because of this, treading water is often accompanied by sculling water with the arms to make it easier on the legs; this works as a full body workout (the application in this context of treading water). That's what those divers likely do at the ocean surface level while chatting with their friends. Treading can be done in other ways too. My high school water polo practices had everyone tread water with arms raised above water for several minutes, to maximize conditioning benefits. Even if arms are kept down and not used to scull water, it is still a great workout for the entire body. Your upper body gets respiratory benefits, plus the upper chest muscles and abs muscles are used too. Kick-wise, treading water can be done using a flutter kick or by kicking like a frog one leg after another. Divers regularly use flutter kick to navigate through the depths... so treading water using flutter kick shouldn't be hard for them, although most people probably find the frog version of the tread kick easier. However, each type of kick also targets different leg muscles for conditioning so both can be alternated if one type of kick wears out your legs. As indicated by the article, treading water is great for conditioning the entire body. 

My suggestion is to pick up a copy of the book Total Immersion, it specializes in teaching about good form with some interesting concepts thrown in. One thing I think I recall reading from it is that when you feel your form falter during a rep, stop! Or the bad form becomes habitual. Swim only when the form is good, and build up distance and speed at the same time as long as form remains good. Swimming only when form is good makes a habit out of good form and trains your body to remain consistent in good form even if you get tired and have a hard time keeping good form. Go slow at first while you work on form. The surest sign of weak form is if you can't do it correctly when you go slow. It's like a balancing act, unlike when you go fast and bad form doesn't throw you off balance as easily. After that, you can do some High Interval Intensity Training (HIIT) from time to time and for only as long as form stays good, with 80-100% effort. That will boost your endurance for short distance sprints and you'll eventually increase the distance you can sprint using good form. 

As someone who's been a competitive swimmer for many years, my input is this: You state that you're doing 3x martial arts and 1x gym workouts per week, which can be plenty or not enough depending on your physical fitness level. It's up to you how much swimming you want to incorporate into your busy schedule, but one way to approach your situation (to avoid further knee problems for now, at least) is to make swimming a bigger priority than the other two. This means swimming 3-4 times/week, starting each following day with a warm-up of 100 extra yards and working down a ladder at a slow to medium pace, before getting to the high intensity part of the workout. For example... if you swim on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday... slow to medium pace warm-up would be like: 

Always use freestyle (the crawl) for the first rep in the warmup set, and after that you can mix strokes for the remaining reps of the warmup set if you want. I find this works extremely well for me. After the warm up set, on days when I'm up for it I will throw in plenty of short burst, short distance HIIT (high intensity interval training) reps using my favorite strokes. You can do the same. By doing this, it's possible to get cardio to a comfortable zone all around and eventually swim miles nonstop. Just remember that muscle recovery and eating well is just as important, and you'll do great with cardio. 

There is a very useful analysis of a selection of multiple studies to be found here: $URL$ I'll start out by assuming that you adjust your feet angle to your stance width (or vice-versa) to keep the femurs and tibias in the same plane as the line from mid-heel to mid-toe. I know this isn't exactly what you're asking — I'll get back to that later — but let's do so for a moment for the sake of discussion. Here's the effects of hip angle on various aspects according to the studies. 

As yisrael said in his answer, so-called "spot reduction" through exercise is now generally regarded as a myth and impossible. But there can be other factors that affect fat distribution and how easily it accumulates. There's multiple studies showing an inverse relation between testosterone levels and abdominal fat, although some of it is specifically visceral fat (which can still add to waist size). Perhaps you should get your testosterone levels checked and see if they fall within normal levels. That said, you're slightly taller than me and the same weight. I've been strength training for over a year and also still have quite a bit of abdominal fat to lose. So I'd say you probably just need to bring the body fat percentage down. 

Number 3 is important because, if you were to keep lifting the same weight, or keep using the same volume (reps, sets...) your body has adapted to it and it no longer is a stress that urges it to improve. By creating a stress, recovering from it and letting your body adapt, you'll now have a new baseline. From there you can impose a greater stress, that will repeat the cycle. Number 4 is important because if you were to stop training once you consider yourself strong and/or muscular enough, your body won't feel the need to keep all that around and you'll slowly regress to your pre-training state. So in that respect, making any improvements at all will require that you pass your "limits", if your current baseline is considered your limit. However, that's usually not what we mean by "limit". Passing your "limits" is impossible because of the definition of a limit, or it means you've gone beyond some point that's within common sense and you'll suffer injury. So the question then is, exactly how much stress must you impose? Judging by your question, you have a "more is better" mentality. That isn't true. You must induce enough stress to disrupt homeostasis, and also enough for the adaptation to be meaningful. But not so much that it can't be recovered from. Say that you go into your first gym session and you start squatting. After getting technique down you start with the bar, and then do sets of 5 reps with 5 kg / 10 lbs increments. At some point it starts feeling heavy, so we see if an additional 2.5 kg / 5 lbs is manageable. If so, that's a good starting point. If technique starts suffering, maybe we take a little weight off and then do 3 to 5 sets (depending on program) with that weight. This is enough to disrupt homeostasis, but can also be recovered from. The rookie lifter will come back into the gym 2 days later and be able to do the same number of sets and reps with 5 kg / 10 lbs or 2.5 kg / 10 lbs more, and this will continue for a good amount of time, because the rate of stress, recovery and adaptation are right. Now if we take our beginner lifter up to a weight that feels challenging on the first workout, and then start screaming "BREAK YOUR LIMIIIITS!" and add another 5 kg / 10 lbs to the bar, and have them do 10 sets, no matter how much technique suffers and how slow the movement back up becomes, you'll either set your lifter up for great injury, or when they come back 2 days later they're barely able to stand up, let alone do another workout. A martial arts champion will have started as a rookie one day. If we take a rookie and put him in the ring with the champion and tell them "go nuts, boys", the rookie won't make quicker progress. He'll go to the hospital, or morgue. The rookie must start with rookie training, in the right dosage, to make progress. Then maybe one day he'll be a champion. Like coach Mark Rippetoe has stated a number of times: you don't get stronger by lifting weights, you get stronger by recovering from lifting weights. 6 hour workouts seem rather absurd if you're not a pro athlete, not a pro bodybuilder or on a ton of steroids. If you're a skinny guy, doing Starting Strength, StrongLifts 5x5 or some other sensible beginner program without any extra crap, eating enough and sleeping well will make you gain strength and muscle. And what's more, it'll be at a close to optimal pace.
