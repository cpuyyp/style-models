Have regular homotopy classes of immersions of manifolds with boundary been studied? i.e. immersions $(M, \partial M) \looparrowright (N, \partial N)$. The references I've looked at from this question state theorems for target manifolds without boundary. Does the $h$-principle apply, or something like it? Simple example to keep in mind: $M$ is $D^1$ with boundary $S^0$, $N$ is $D^1 \times \mathbb{R}$ with boundary $S^0 \times \mathbb{R}$, and let's say each boundary point of $M$ goes to a different component of $\partial N$. It seems to me at a glance that there is a regular homotopy class for each integer, corresponding to the number of counterclockwise turns made along the way from one component to the other. How is this proved? (and generalized?) 

I'm assuming you meant $P_1, P_2 \in SO(3)$, and that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are 1-parameter subgroups. Assuming you want the biinvariant metric on $SO(3)$, the 1-parameter subgroups are also geodesics. If I were doing it, I'd lift them to the double cover (the 3-sphere), where they're great circles, apply an isometry to both of them so that the first moves to standard position, say the $xy$-plane (where $z=w=0$), and find the closest points there. Then undo your isometry. 

As Wojowu writes in the comments, Vaughan's argument (which is a paragraph long and can be read here on page 71) shows that there ought to be infinitely many rectangles inscribed in any Jordan curve. (The rectangles come from the double points of a real projective plane in 3-space, and I think — though can't remember the reference — that the preimage of the double set has a component which is nontrivial in first homology, which would imply it's infinite.) You could fix a side length ratio in advance, and then ask whether there are Jordan curves with exactly one inscribed rectangle with that side length ratio. Probably no one has asked/answered this. Generically there are an even number of rectangles (with fixed side length ratio bigger than 1) inscribed in any Jordan curve, as opposed to an odd number of squares, so you'd have to make the pair of rectangles coincide. EDIT: The preimage of the double set of a cone over the standard Möbius strip in $\mathbb{R}^3$ — take the standard strip near the unit circle in the $xy$-plane and the cone point at e.g. the origin — is a pair of open arcs whose closure is a generator of $H_1$. And this is roughly the picture corresponding to the projective plane you get from considering Vaughan's idea applied to an ellipse. So my recollection was wrong, but was nearly right for that example if you consider the closure of the preimage of the double set. But after being wrong once, I'm even less sure than I was before that I said something near the truth. EDIT 2: It's true for the closure of the double set for generic maps. It's a special case of Theorem 2 in Double decker sets of generic surfaces in 3-space as homology classes; see the paper for the precise meaning of generic in this context. 

Ok, so here's the long version of what I already said in the comments: Start by picking $g_1,\ldots,g_n\in \mathbb C[x]$ such that $g_i\neq g_j$ whenever $i\neq j$ which satisfy the prescribed condition at $0$ (that's not hard). Since $g_i-g_j\neq 0$ for each $i\neq j$, there will be only finitely many $0\neq a\in\mathbb C$ such that $g_i(a)-g_j(a)=0$ for some pair $i,j$ with $i\neq j$. Call these values $a_1,\ldots,a_k$. Then define $$ f_i(x) := \left(\prod_{j=1}^k (x-a_j)^m\right)\cdot g_i(x) $$ Those $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ have pairwise intersection also in $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ (and possibly in $0$), but now with multiplicty at least $2m$ (except in $0$, where the intersection multiplicty is left as it was). The condition at zero is clearly preserved and we didn't add any further intersection points either. 

Here is a counterexample: $A=k[x]/x^2$, $B=k$, $M=N=A$ as an $(A,A)$-bimodule. Then $\dim_k M\otimes_A M = \dim_k M = 2$, but $\dim_k N\otimes_B N = 4$, so $N\otimes_B N$ cannot possibly embed into $M\otimes_A M$. And of course there are also examples where the natural map $N\otimes_B N\longrightarrow M\otimes_A M$ is not surjective. 

Even more is true: Two possible cores of $M$ lie in the same genus, i.e. they become isomorphic in the localization at any prime of $\mathbb Z$. However, I couldn't find an explicit proof of this anywhere in literature Edit: It's Proposition 5.4 in Gruenberg: "Relation Modules of Finite Groups" (though unfortunately there's apparently no online version of this book besides google books). Assume you have two decompositions $M=C_1\oplus P_1 = C_2 \oplus P_2$ with $P_1$ and $P_2$ projective. Assume furthermore that one cannot split off any further non-zero projective summands from $C_1$ and $C_2$. By a theorem of Swan (see Swan: Projective modules over finite groups) $\mathbb Q\otimes P_1$ and $\mathbb Q\otimes P_2$ are free, and therefore so is $\mathbb Z_{(p)} \otimes P_1$ and $\mathbb Z_{(p)}\otimes P_2$ ($\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ denotes the localization of $\mathbb Z$ at $p$; this simply uses the fact that since the columns of the decomposition matrix of a finite group are linearly independent, the isomorphism type of the $\mathbb Q$-span of a projective $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$-module determines the isomorphism type of the projective module; alternatively see Theorem (77.14) on p. 548 in Curtis, Reiner: Representation theory of finite groups and associative algebras). So now apply cancellation for $\mathbb Z_{(p)}G$-lattices (see Corollary 1 in this paper of Reiner) to find that unless $P_1$ and $P_2$ have the same $\mathbb Z$-rank (in which case we would be done), either $C_1$ or $C_2$ (say, w.l.o.g. $C_1$) has a non-zero free summand in every localization. So if this is the case, then take for each prime $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ that divides $G$ an epimorphism $$ \phi_i: \mathbb Z_{(p_i)} \otimes C_1 \twoheadrightarrow \mathbb Z_{(p_i)}G \subset \mathbb QG $$ By multiplying each $\phi_i$ with a sufficiently large integer relatively prime to $p_i$ we may assume $\phi_i(C_1) \subseteq \mathbb Z G $ for each $i$. Now we get a map $$ \phi := \sum_{i=1}^n \left(\prod_{j\neq i} p_j \right)\cdot \phi_i|_{C_1} $$ $\phi$ is a homomorphism from $C_1$ to $\mathbb Z G$, which is an epimorphism in the localization at each $p_i$ (by construction: the factor $\prod_{j\neq i} p_j$ is a unit in $\mathbb Z_{(p_i)}$ and in the radical of each $\mathbb Z_{(p_j)}$. Hence the image of $\phi$ in the localization at $p_i$ is the same as the image of $\phi_i$). The image of $\phi$ in the localization at any other prime is projective anyways, since if $p$ doesn't divide the order of $G$, then any $\mathbb Z_{(p)}G$-lattice is projective. So now we have a homomorphism from $C_1$ onto the image of $\phi$, and the image of $\phi$ is projective in each localization. But then by Theorem (78.1) on p. 550 in Curtis&Reiner the image of $\phi$ is projective, and therefore the image of $\phi$ is a projective summand of $C_1$. This contradicts the assumption that we couldn't split off any further projective summands from $C_1$. 

Here is a complete answer: Every semigroup $S$ of invertible $2\times 2$*-matrices which is transitive on* $\mathbb R^2$ is either conjugate to $SO_2(\mathbb R) \times \mathbb R^+$ or $SO_2(\mathbb R) \times \mathbb R$ or it is a product of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ and a multiplicative subgroup of $\mathbb R$*.* Proof: Let S be such a semigroup. Then the intersection $S_0$ with $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ is a subsemigroup of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$. By a theorem of Hilgert and Hofmann (see their beautiful paper on "Old and new on $SL_2$") there are only three choices for $S_0$: Either $S_0$ is all of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$, a circle group or contained in a conjugate of the elements of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ with only positive entries. If $S_0$ is a circle group, then $S$ will be conjugate to $SO_2(\mathbb R) \times \mathbb R^+$ or $SO_2(\mathbb R) \times \mathbb R$. If $S_0$ happens to be all of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$, then we have $SL_2(\mathbb R)\subset S \subset GL_2(\mathbb R)$, so $S$ is a product of $SL_2(\mathbb R)$ and a multiplicative subgroup of $\mathbb R$. In the third case, we may assume that $S_0$ is actually contained in the semigroup described above. Then $S_0$ maps every vector with two positive entries to a vector with two posiitve entries, hence $S$ maps the upper right quadrant to a subset of itself and the lower left quadrant. In particular, $S$ cannot be transitive. 

While the answer to your question is negative in general, as pointed out before, the answer is positive for certain type of loop groups. This can be proved using topological twin buildings. See Linus Kramer, Loop Groups and Twin Building. (It is not stated very explicitly, but the topology used on the twin building and hence the algebraic loop group is meant to be the ind-topology coming from the Bruhat cell decomposition.) 

Arbitrary Zariski-dense subgroups in a semisimple group can be very small from a real-analytic point of view. It seems that algebra cannot distinguish between "small" and "large" Zariski-dense subgroups, so most criteria to distinguish between the two have a strong non-algebraic flavour. (Of course one can also characterize arithmetic groups algebraically, but this has even less to do with the line of argument you seem to suggest.) From a dynamical point of view, the key difference between lattices and arbitrary Zariski-dense subgroups is that the former act transitively on the product of the Furstenberg boundary of the ambient Lie group with itself ("double ergodicity"). This is a sort of "largeness" property. There are various ways to capture this property, the most systematic way seems to me the concept of a generalized Weyl group due to Bader and Furman. 

I believe the answer to your question is yes. The Reynolds operator $$ R: k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n] \longrightarrow k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n} $$ is $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n}$-equivariant, and therefore in particular $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-equivariant. Also, $R$ is a projection, and therefore the image of $R$ is a direct summand of of its domain of definition. It follows therefore that the $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-module $ k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n}$ is a direct summand of the free $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]^{S_n\times S_n}$-module $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,Y_1,\ldots,Y_n]$. Now since the action of $S_n\times S_n$ is generated by reflections, its invariant ring is a polynomial ring, and therefore any direct summand of a free module over this ring is again free (this is the Quillen–Suslin theorem). 

There really isn't any need for character theory over non-algebraically closed fields. The Grothendieck group of $KG$ embeds into the Grothendieck group of $\bar K G$ (i.e. of the group ring over the algebraic closure). Therefore all information about a $KG$-module $M$ you could possibly hope to recover from any type of "character of $M$" is already contained in the Brauer character of the $\bar K G$-module $\bar K \otimes M$. Also, the values of the Brauer character of $M$ will lie in the ring of Witt-vectors over $K$. 

Regarding the part of your question about involutions. I don't think it's always possible to find a maximal order stable under a given involution. For instance, take $F=\mathbb Q$, $A = \mathbb Q^{2\times 2}$ and the involution $$ \sigma: A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M\cdot X^\top \cdot M^{-1} $$ with $$ M=\left(\begin{array}{cc} 2&0\newline 0&1\end{array}\right) $$ Now any maximal order $\Theta$ in $A$ is conjugate to $\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, and therefore all $\Theta$-lattices in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$ are of the form $n\cdot L$ for dome $n\in \mathbb Q$ and some fixed full $\mathbb Z$-lattice L in $\mathbb Q^{1\times 2}$. Note that the determinant of a basis matrix for $n\cdot L$ is well-defined up to sign (since two basis matrices differ only by an element of ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Z)$), and $\det(n\cdot L) = \pm n^2\cdot \det(L)$. In what follows assume $\Theta$ is a maximal order such that $\sigma(\Theta) \subseteq \Theta$. This will lead to a contradiction. For any $S\in{\rm GL}(2,\mathbb Q)$ we can replace $M$ by $M' = S M S^{\top}$, $\Theta$ by $\Theta'=S\Theta S^{-1}$ and $\sigma$ by $$ \sigma': A \longrightarrow A: X \mapsto M'\cdot X^\top \cdot M'^{-1} $$ So assume that $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$, $L'=\mathbb Z^{1\times 2}$ and $\sigma'(\Theta') \subseteq \Theta'$. Note that the determinant of $M'$ will be $2\cdot \det S^2$, which is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Now here's the problem: $L'\cdot M'$ is not of the form $n\cdot L'$, since $\det M'$ is not a square in $\mathbb Q$. Therefore $L'\cdot M'$ cannot be stable under the action of $\Theta'^\top = \Theta'$. Hence $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \neq L'\cdot M' $$ which implies $$ L' \cdot M' \cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \neq L' $$ which tells you that $$ \sigma'(\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}) = M'\cdot \mathbb Z^{2\times 2} \cdot M'^{-1} \nsubseteq {\rm End}_{\mathbb Z}(L')=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2} $$ which is a contradiction (as $\Theta'=\mathbb Z^{2\times 2}$ was assumed to be stable under $\sigma'$). 

I am surprised to see that so many people suggest meta-mathematical articles, which try to explain how one should do good mathematics in one or the other form. Personally, I usually find it a waste of time to read these, and there a few statements to which I agree so wholeheartedly as the one of Borel: "I feel that what mathematics needs least are pundits who issue prescriptions or guidelines for presumably less enlightened mortals." The mere idea that you can learn how to do mathematics (or in fact anything useful) from reading a HowTo seems extremely weird to me. I would rather read any classical math article, and there are plenty of them. The subject does not really matter, you can learn good mathematical thinking from each of them, and in my opinion much easier than from any of the above guideline articles. Just to be constructive, take for example (in alphabetical order) 

I am not suggesting that any mathematician should read all of them, but any one of them will do. In fact, the actual content of these papers does not matter so much. It is rather, that they give an insight how a new idea is born. So, if you want to give birth to new ideas yourself, look at them, not at some guideline. 

If we ignore the trivial case of the affine line, then irreducible symmetric spaces come in pairs compact - non-compact. The compact ones are naturally projective varieties, while the non-compact ones are affine varieties. Thus question (4) is problematic, unless you mean "locally symmetric" or a more general notion of symmetric space than I understand here (i.e. "globally symmetric Riemannian symmetric space"). As far as non-compact symmetric spaces are concerned, they are Kähler if and only if they are biholomorphic to a bounded symmetric domain. Equivalently, there exists a compact quotient with non-trivial H^2 or, equivalently, the point stabilizer of the automorphism group has infinite center... I could give many more characterizations, but I do not quite see what you are after, so maybe you can provide more detailed information?
