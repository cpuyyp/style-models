One significant choice point, which I think deserves its own answer, is the choice between "walkable" or non-walkable shoes/cleats. Some cleats (eg, SPD) are fairly compact, and with the right shoes ("mountain biking" or "touring" shoes with lugs and a depression to accept the cleat) it's reasonably (if not incredibly comfortable) to walk a moderate distance with the shoes. Other cleats (eg, SPD-SL) are larger and cannot practically be installed on shoes in a way to permit walking any distance. 

All of these factors effectively multiply on each other such that a very slight change in posture can produce a dramatic drop in output. Also, many of the factors will be influenced to a degree by temperature, wind, the degree of fatigue, etc, so doing "tests" of one scheme and then the other can easily produce ambiguous results. 

You want a geared bike -- not necessarily 50 speeds, but at least 3, preferably 15 or so. If derailleur-style bikes scare you, there are geared hub bikes available (though they tend to be a bit more expensive). (But, honestly, there's nothing to be afraid of with a modern derailleur-style bike, if properly maintained.) If you're only going to be riding on roads and paved trails (which is most likely the case, at least first year or so), the type of bike makes little difference, so long as it fits you appropriately and is comfortable to handle. (Though at your weight a "full suspension" bike is probably not a good idea, and, in general, even front suspension is not of much use on roads). Mainly you should pick a bike that fits you well and is comfortable. You need a 10-20 minute ride to really check this out, and any bike shop that won't let you do that (within reason) you should avoid. Be wary of the handlebar. Most bikes are delivered with the handlebar too low, and modern "threadless" front bearing setups require adapters to raise the handlebar to an appropriate height. Make sure you get the handlebar height set appropriately before you leave the shop, and go back if it seems to need changing. Be wary of the seat. Many "comfort" bikes (which are worth considering) will come with an enormously wide seat, which may seem wise at the beginning but quickly chafes the inner thighs. You don't want super-narrow, but likely not super-wide either. (Of course the seat can be changed fairly easily.) And, while purists sneer at gell-filled seats, they can be more comfortable for rides of intermediate length (over an hour, say), so long as they're not too "squishy". Stay away from the pillow-like foam seats, however. 

Terry makes bikes especially for women, but they start at over $1000. A used Terry (check Craig's List, et al) might be the ticket, though. Terry makes their bikes with smaller wheels than the standard 700/27inch standard for men's bikes. And on some models the front tire is smaller than the back, to allow the top bar to be lower. As a low-cost option, probably finding a good "youth" bike and adapting it would be the way to go -- look for 24" models. (One thing you should do is determine her "stand-over" height to size the bike frame. Easy enough to do with a broomstick and yardstick -- and with a few romantic possibilities to boot.) 

Crank bolts. They need to be really torqued, but you're always wary of over-torquing, so a torque wrench provides a good confidence factor. 

It depends -- on the lube you use, the type of riding you do, and how much of a maintenance nut you are. 

I have also seen pictures, many years ago in an old bike book, of a crank with a pivoting piece. Basically, imagine the crank cut off at about the 2/3rds point, and then the cut-off piece reattached with a pivot. The crank would go down to the bottom of the stroke, but only come up a little over midway. (Kinda like a car on a Ferris wheel.) Unfortunately, I have no idea if this is still made, or where you might find it. 

A badly rusted chain is a sign that the bike has been left outside for extended periods with minimal maintenance, and is therefore a bad sign. A little rust on the chain, or on scratched spots on the frame, however, is not a deal-breaker. Spin all the bearings and make sure they turn easily and smoothly. Check that brakes and shifters operate -- the cables aren't rusted to where they don't work. Learn to observe the rear dropout as an indicator of bike quality. 

The condition of the road. Often the right-most portion of the lane is in poor condition and needs to be avoided when possible. The width of the lane. With a wider lane it's reasonable to occupy just the right-most portion of the lane while still giving vehicle traffic room to pass, with minimal lane shifting on their part. With a narrow lane, on the other hand, it's unwise to "encourage" vehicles to attempt to squeeze past without executing a complete lane shift, so more of a "claim your lane" style is advised. The amount of traffic. In light traffic it's more reasonable to "claim your lane", as the number of drivers you inconvenience is small. In heavier traffic you need to make more effort to not block traffic flow (though you also need to make an effort to be visible and predictable in your movements). So in heavy traffic you may need to consciously shift your lane position based on the immediate situation, pulling off onto the shoulder if possible to let large trucks past, eg. 

The first thing to look at is "standover height". The child should be able to stand straddling the bike with both feet flat on the ground (and still comfortable clearance for "the valuables"). This is usually a bit easier on "mountain" style bikes, but don't take take too much advantage of that or you may get a bike that is too large overall. And if the bike really will be ridden off-road you want more clearance. But getting a bike that's grossly too small is not a good idea either. Second, look at seat height. If this is a "starter" bike then it's best if it's possible to lower the seat enough that the child can sit on the seat and with his/her toes balance the bike and push it along. However, there needs to be enough adjustment range built in so that the seat can be lifted high enough to get (nearly) full leg extension at the bottom of the stroke (plus a little extra for growing room). (Start raising the seat a half-inch at a time once the child is steady on the bike.) Finally "reach" -- generally if the height is right the reach will be OK, but check it, since some small bikes are actually built for larger kids. The child should be able to grasp the handlebars without having to lean forward more than a little -- we're not wanting to see an aero crouch here. Note that for the first two measurements you can work from leg measurements, if you don't want the child shopping with you. (Use your best judgment regarding "clearance".) "Reach" will generally be OK if the bike is reasonably "normal" in form-factor. 

You really only have 3 variables -- the width of the BB shell, it's diameter, and the threading. To my knowledge the diameter is pretty much standard these days (though no doubt some fancy-smancy bike are outside the box), and there are only a couple of standard widths. And last I heard (which was about 10 years ago) only some Italian brands persisted in using oddball threading. So the main thing to check is shell width. 

I'll confess to shaving my butt (with an electric trimmer) prior to a long ride. This largely alleviates "butt burn". But leg hairs don't seem to be a problem when I wear standard cycling shorts. I have had leg hair problems, though, when wearing other types of shorts. (My legs aren't all that hairy, though.) 

I'd guess that running soapy water through the housing would cause it to corrode faster, since you'd never be able to rinse it out well. (Very) light oiling will help. 

How many miles on the chainring? A worn chainring could be part of the problem. In addition, the rear derailer tension arm may be sticking a bit and not maintaining good tension (though from the looks of your bike in that picture the derailer is probably shiny clean). But I suspect the missing derailer is a big part of it. When the chain "jumps" onto a new cog it whips around quite a bit, and the front derailer would help contain things. Have you tried cranking it and shifting while it's on a service stand, so you can observe the derailer action in detail? 

For 1-8 miles (and presumably reasonably flat terrain) you don't need anything special -- basically 2 wheels with tires on them and pedals to move them. I'd suggest that you first check with friends for something you can have/borrow for free, or, failing that, get a used bike, preferably from a bike shop. An inexpensive multi-speed "mountain bike" style bike (26" tires, relatively flat handlebar, upright riding position -- vs the road-style bike with larger, narrower tires, "drop" handlebars, and bent-over riding position) is a good style to start with, but stay away from "fancy" bikes with rear suspension, et al -- just more weight and complexity you don't need. If you do find a borrowed bike (or perhaps a yard sale bike), take it to a bike shop to get it "tuned up", since likely the derailers and brakes will be in need of adjustment. And buy yourself a tire pump (of the of the old-fashioned "floor" variety) and pressure gauge (if not built into the pump) so you can keep the tires at their proper pressure. Re cold weather, it's probably not a good idea to start out biking below about 10C, though once you get used to it (and collect the right bits of clothing) -20C is reasonable without extreme measures. Your most critical need is good gloves (maybe two layers), as you can't exactly put your hands in your pockets when they get cold. You also need, of course, long pants and some sort of wind-resistant shell, but it's surprisingly critical to KEEP COOL, so the "shell" must "breathe" to a degree, and insulation should be on the light side, given the weather. There are of course specialty bike clothes, but start with what's already in your closet. Also, get some Velcro leg straps at the bike shop, to keep your pant leg from getting caught in the chain. 

In general, crank fixing bolts need A LOT of torque. This chart list torques for several varieties of crank arms. (I suspect you have a variety of Octalink.) You're probably looking at something in the neighborhood of 350 inch pounds, which would be 35 pounds applied to a 10-inch lever arm. Too much force and you shear the bolt. Too little force and the arm works loose again. The torque spec embossed on the bottom bracket cup is most certainly for the cup, not the crank arm. Unfortunately, if your crank arm fell off I suspect it's been damaged, and is apt to no longer fit tightly, no matter how tight the bolt. 

Slow leak The first thing you need is a pump. Sometimes (but not usually) you can pump up the flat tire and it will hold air for 30 minutes or so, allowing you to ride home or at least letting you ride for several minutes before you stop and pump it up again. Hole The normal case is that there is no obvious damage to the tire, but when you try to pump it up it doesn't hold air. Then you need the pump, "tire irons", and either a patch kit or a spare inner tube. You may also need wrenches to loosen your wheel, if it does not have a "quick release". The procedure is to remove the wheel from the bike, then use the tire "irons" (most of which now are actually made of plastic) to pry one side of the tire off the rim. (This procedure is a bit more complicated than that statement -- it takes practice to do without damaging the inner tube further, and an entire article could be written on this topic alone.) Then remove the inner tube from inside the tire. At this point, even if you have a spare tube, it's wise to attempt to find the hole in the old tube and then look at that spot inside the tire to see if there's still a nail or thorn sticking through. Using spare tube Then, if you have a spare tube, you install it in place of the bad one (pump a little air into it first to make it round), use the tire irons to get the tire back on the rim, and then pump up the tire. I like to pump it up once, deflate it, and then pump again, to help position the tube and "seat" the tire on the rim. Once it's pumped up examine the wheel for any obvious lumps (indicating the tube may be twisted inside) and to see that the tire is evenly installed on the rim. Using patch kit If you don't have a spare tube (but DO have a patch kit), you should attach your pump to the old one and try to pump it up. Air will exit the leak, and you can hear/feel the air escaping. Mark the hole somehow -- a pencil, a ballpoint pen, or a piece of chalk will work. But note that you will be cleaning the area around the hole, so make marks well away from the hole that you can line up to locate the hole after cleaning. Read the instructions that come with the patch kit. Usually you clean around the hole using the sandpaper that comes in the patch kit, spread glue (also in the kit) around the hole and let it mostly dry, then attach the patch over the hole. Then it's usually wise to wait 5-10 minutes before inflating (though during that period several times pressing the patch tightly against the tube). It's probably a good idea to then inflate the tube a bit to be sure that there are no more holes and that you covered the one hole correctly. I like to spread some chalk powder or simply a bit of dust from the ground over the patch area to keep it from sticking to the inside of the tire. Reinstall the tube the same as with the spare tube. Large hole If you discover that you have a large hole or cut in the tire then it's necessary to use some sort of "boot" inside the tire, to keep the new/repaired tube from bulging through the hole. Of course, some holes are simply too large for this to work, but usually it's worth a try regardless of how big the hole is. For a boot you want a piece of thin but relatively stiff/strong material. Special strips of reenforced rubber are sold at bike shops for this, or you can cut a section from the side of an old tire. A popular technique in the US is to use a folded-up dollar bill -- the paper that the US dollar is made from is quite durable and stiff, and, if a relatively new bill is folded into four layers it works quite well for small or medium holes. To use the boot you get the tube repaired and installed, and just before you put the tire back on the rim you work the boot in between the tube and tire so that it covers the hole. Then put the tire back on the rim and inflate.
