Probably no. Introduction of Yoga in earnest to the West only occurred from the late 1920s onwards. The likelihood of any of the few early adopters being on the Titanic is low; especially as no Indian nationals were on the passenger manifest. 

In light of the recent news kerfuffle regarding a child found in a Romani (gypsy) camp; it got me wondering: At what point in history did the idea1 of gypsies stealing children start? And from where and in what manner did the idea propagate through Europe? 1. Real or imagined or some admixture of the two. 

They used lots of very large, very heavy stones. You will note that these constructions did not have large internal air pockets relative to volume. They qualify as monuments or fortifications more than inhabitable buildings with a decent amount of floorspace. Having arches or domes or any large enclosed internal space was considered the height of engineering achievement - and most did not survive well. The internal space of an Egyptian pyramid was a fraction (1.3%) of a modern pyramid like the Louvre skylight (probably 99.5%). 

I was looking up the war between Tanzania and Uganda, where Tanzanian forces invaded Uganda to remove Idi Amin, and learned that Idi Amin was able to hold out for a little while thanks to the support of a contingent of Libyan forces sent by Khadafi. Here is an interesting article that summarizes the campaign: $URL$ The question is, why did Khadafi chose to back Idi Amin, even to the extent of deploying military assets in support of the Ugandan Army? Did Khadafi think he could establish a base in the region that he could use to promote Libyan power and influence? Did Khadafi see economic interests in the African Great Lakes region, and hoped to use Uganda as a country from which to back his regional economic interests with military force? What happened to the Libyans once Idi Amin fell? Did they just flee to neighboring countries? Or did the bulk of the Libyan forces surrender, and had to be repatriated back to Libya under tough negotiations? Brian Ghilliotti 

It depends on which document written by a philosopher or equivalent secular agitator was the first to be co-opted by the secular revolutionaries of Europe (or elsewhere) and hence become a political document in its own right. Since ancient civic philosophies can become religions, Confucius' writings may not qualify as a political document in the fashion you specify. A more modern political document would be John Locke's Two Treatises of Government in 1689. If you mean document of this sort and written by someone in power (i.e. the government itself) then Thomas Jefferson's writings are an example. Of course if nothing else, the League of Nations' charter would have to qualify. As you can see, the question might be a tad broad. 

The legal custom for the firstborn and only the firstborn to inherit the bulk of the estate, especially indivisible property. An illegitimate child without the right to inherit. In which countries and periods of history, if any, could the order of primogeniture be adjusted by acknowledging a bastard? And could a previously legitimate heir be disinherited by "converting" them into a bastard? 

Why didn’t the Chinese leave a trip wire force in North Korea after the Korean War in a similar fashion to the United States leaving a trip wire force in South Korea? 

This was a major raid by Khemer Rouge forces over the Vietnamese border, resulting in the deaths of over 3000 Vietnamese. For more information and details, please see: $URL$ $URL$ Was Pol Pot that foolish enough to think that he could carry out such a raid without a severe response from Vietnam? It turned out that this raid was a major catalyst leading to Vietnam’s invasion of Cambodia and subsequent overthrow of the Khemer Rouge. The only logical explanation for this raid that I can think of is that Pol Pot was using Vietnamese border raids as a way of distracting the militant energy of his subordinates instead of letting this militancy result in a potential coup against himself. If this was the case, this got out of hand quickly. Or this was a decision made by a local Khemer Rouge commander that Pol Pot was not aware of. In any case, this raid would later set a lot in motion two invasions (Vietnam vs Cambodia and China vs Vietnam) and years of insurgency in Cambodia. 

According to this article, "no one in the ancient world ever flatly denied that Jesus performed miracles – let alone that he existed." Is this historically accurate? Are there any claims in history from the first century primarily (although maybe a few centuries afterward may be allowed in the definition of "the ancient world") that deny Jesus Christ existed? There is historical evidence that supports his existence, as I said in the comments below: 

What astronomical events have helped determine the accuracy of historical dates of Middle Eastern (specifically Persian) events? Some examples of Middle Eastern/Persian events could be the year a king was reigning or the start/end of war. Some examples of astronomical events could be observed supernovae or comets. 

Out of curiosity, did any ancient historian consider Tiberius' first year as Emperor to be the first year of his co-regency with Augustus? According to an answer to a question on Hermeneutics StackExchange, the author of the Gospel of Luke, who took a historian's approach to telling the story of Jesus may have counted Tiberius' 15th year from his first year as co-regent. So I am wondering if any other ancient historians have done the same thing, whether it be with Tiberius and Augustus or any other rulers. 

If we assume that the trend to empire existed for generations before Julius Caesar was assassinated: Was the very expansion that eventually doomed the Roman Republic/Empire economically or culturally pre-ordained? 

Removal of a source of friction with their British ally, as France's primary goals at the time were Eurocentric. To forestall a complete revision of the Skyes-Picot Agreement regarding the partition of the Ottoman empire: Giving away Mosul in order to keep control of Syria and Lebanon. The British (David Lyoyd George) might have promised to share exploitation of much as 50% of the oil found in Mosul. 

No. Slavery was banned in the first 1820 constitution and this ban was explicitly re-enforced in the 1847 constitution when Liberia declared independence. If Liberians owned slaves within Liberia they did so without any legal recourse and the strong risk of losing their property. 

I was looking through Wikipedia (a mixed quality source) about the military history of Yugoslavia, when I noticed this odd listing of Yugoslavia as one of the combatants in the Angolan Civil War (1975-2002). If this was true, then it deviates from Yugoslavia's traditional foreign policy of neutrality and non-intervention during the Cold War. The Wikipedia article that mentions this does not go into any detail about this topic other than the list. Here is the link: $URL$ I would imagine that Yugoslavia, whatever it was doing there, must have left the conflict zone well before the break up process of that country in the mid 1990's. Besides this conclusion, I must wonder what the mission of the Yugoslavian military was in Angola? Was it to just provide non-combat military assistance? Did it provide stand off combat military related support, such as artillery cover, air support, and military training? Or did Yugoslav military forces get involved in frontline, tactical level engagements with hostile military forces in that country? If anyone could please fill me in on this historical oddity, it would be appreciated. Thanks. Brian Ghilliotti
