The entire front, from the mountains of Switzerland to the north coast of France, was a fortified line (and often multiple lines) of trenches, artillery, barbed wire and soldiers. Early in the war, Germany managed to push back the anglo-french forces for days. During this time attempts to flank and maneuver where used. Because cavalry was nearly useless against modern infantry (the firepower of modern infantry let it turn, wipe out a cavalry attack, and then continue walking with little harm), the forces trying to chase and flank moved no faster than the forces retreating. Around about the time that Germany was approaching Paris, the Anglo-French forces turned and attacked. The long chase left weak spots in the German line (and no trenches) resulting in German armies being out-flanked. They retreated and formed a line (still in French territory) and fortified. Once fortified, attempts to attack resulted in ridiculous casualties on the attacking force. So both sides tried to out flank the other. On one side the Swiss mountains made it impractical -- so they both tried to out flank towards the English Channel. The result was a set of fortifications that stretched right to the ocean (or, in some cases, estuaries of the ocean -- some dykes where breached to form impassible terrain). So we have a stalemate. Various attempts to break this stalemate and improve the quality of the defences where tried. At Verdun, the Germans tried to use ridiculously intense artillery followed by infiltration tactics to take the high ground in an area they figured the French would want back and where the French supply lines where limited, then proceed to cause so many casualties while defending that the French nation itself would collapse. As it turned out, the Germans lost almost as many men as the French. Defence in depth was developed, where the front-line trenches would be held by machine guns and fewer men, and back trenches would hold more men and artillery. When the attackers overran the front trenches (taking lots of casualties) the defending artillery and second line trenches and machine guns would open up slaughtering them, followed by a counter attack against them, with the front-line trenches designed to be undefendable from the "rear". Both sides developed this over the war. Tanks where introduced and battle tested. More like tractor-bus hybrids than what we call a tank today. They successfully overran defences, but they initially lacked numbers to create full breach, and by the time the British had enough of them the Germans had started to develop counter tactics. Finally, after the Russians where knocked out of the war and the USA was threatening to turn the tide, Germany turned its full military might onto the western front. In a massive attack it overran the weaker parts of the defensive line. Stronger areas of the defensive held, and even the flanks of the stronger areas proved unexploitable. Troops in the weaker areas fell back (again, at the same speed the attacking troops advanced) and interior supply lines let the defender form new lines faster than the attackers could advanced. The Germans managed to take useless hellscapes destroyed by previous battles in the war, couldn't maintain supply lines through those hell scapes, got bogged down without defensive works of their own, and fell to a counter attack. With new supplies and troops arriving from the USA, 100s of Tanks, and tactics developed and refined over the war, the allies proceeded to push back the Germans again and again. German allies started capitulating (often having been defeated in the field), cutting off supplies and opening new flanks. Despite the fall of the Russian empire, the material, technological (tanks) and supply advantages of the Allies with the addition of the USA had become insurmountable. 

So, did American Hispanophobia start due to the aftereffects of the Texas Revolution and Texas annexation over 150 years ago? Or is modern Anti-Mexican Sentiment not primarily a continuation of those aftereffects? If so, what is the root cause of Anti-Mexican Sentiment, then? 

From following the references at Wikipedia, I found The Lost History of the Transistor. Which led me to How Europe Missed The Transistor, which, seems to suggest that France or Germany could have been the first creators of the transistor... 

From reading Wikipedia's Anti-Mexican Sentiment Article, it appears that America's modern Hispanophobia stems from 

So... France made transistor-like things six months after Bell Labs... If they had gotten the PTT visit when they first asked... perhaps we would have 'transistron circuits' instead of 'transistor circuits'... 

Did any era's Samurai know Outdoors Survival Knowledge? If so, which eras, which country (or however Japan separated its land at that time), and how much did they know? 

How was the current month and day disseminated to the townspeople of the Medieval Europe? I'm quite sure that personal calendars weren't a thing back then... but I could be wrong... If they had a shared calendar... where was it stored and how did the information of the date get to the people from that location? I think it wasn't newsprint... as Oldest Newspapers has the oldest European Newspaper start in 1605... It might be Avvisi, the precursor of European newspapers... but those only existed from 1500s onwards... and mainly for Italy... 

It seems that anyone experimenting with germanium diodes, would have ended up with the transistor, at some point... 

... Now I'm wonder about British efforts... they had that 'Sterling bomber' with its Allied radar tech... were they researching better radar too? Or just using the American efforts wholesale?? 

Can you help me find a online resource for gendered handwriting styles, like "ladies' epistolary" and "Mercantile running hand"? Preferably with pictures, as I want an easy reference for their appearances? This cannot be served by search engines because there is no online resource that has anything close to a comprehensive list of these old handwriting styles of the 18th and 19th centuries. Searching "ladies' epistolary" and "Mercantile running hand" together gets this question as the top result, and there are only 6 results in Google. Here: $URL$ Handwriting in America is the closest thing to a comprehensive source and it only adds Roundhand to the list of writing styles. Plus, it is a scanned Google Book, without pictures of those writing styles.
