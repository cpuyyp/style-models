My 1975 Raleigh Twenty meets all of your criteria except "very compact". The Twenty is a folder--the frame folds in half--though many modern folders get much more compact. The upside of the old used Raleigh is that they are much more inexpensive than the best modern folders and still are quite rugged bikes. Raleigh Folders are known for their durability. Check out Sheldon Brown's site about these bikes: $URL$ My partner and I have two of these. We ride other bikes most places but bring the old Raleighs out when we must take them on transit during busy periods. I must say, they've been one of the better used bike purchases we've made. They were made as three-speed IGH bikes with rear cargo racks--I usually roll with panniers on mine. They're great for short trips, though I have done a twelve-mile commute on mine several times with no problem. You might find one of these on CL or Ebay for $150-300 in pretty good condition. 

Panniers are my first choice, though, because they better solve all of these problems. They are completely off of my back and pretty low on the bike. For longer rides and for my daily commute, I generally use panniers. Not all of my bikes have a rack, though. I have ridden my bike from Sacramento-to-the Bay Area wearing a messenger bag. I wouldn't have tried it with a backpack. 

It is important to signal at all times because we can never be SURE that we are totally aware of every other road user. Have you ever had a car "suddenly" appear on your left, seemingly out of nowhere? If you haven't at some point you will. It is natural. Sometimes, despite heightened awareness, we miss something in the near-chaos that is a busy street. I signal in almost any situation that I would in an automobile--when turning, when changing lanes, when coming to a stop. If I am going to eventually get squashed by a car, I don't want it to be for lack of trying to communicate clearly. In the situation that you describe, slowing down to make a turn, I would make two observations. 

As the weather and your skills improve, do a continual risk/benefit analysis of your ride safety outfit. As has already been said, you will get better and better at riding clipless. Right now, you are learning under the most difficult conditions--judging from your question, two of the four falls (50%!) simply wouldn't have happened if you had taken this up in the summertime. So by the time weather is good, you will be even less likely to come off of the bike. As you've probably figured out, the learning curve is generally steep for clipless pedals. Just the same, it isn't unreasonable to think about protecting bare skin from a fall. On the flipside, you should consider the potential for heat injury while riding in the summer. You can hydrate, sure, but you will need to keep your body from overheating if you are riding hard under summer conditions. In central California, riding my bike in long sleeves really would create more risk of heat injury than riding in a t-shirt's risk of abrasion. I don't often fall off of my bike, but when I do it hurts. I don't often suffer from heat stress but honestly, if I do, it has the potential to be just as injurious! That said, I never wear long sleeves in summer while commuting--I wear sunscreen lotion and a t-shirt. I do, however, often wear long sleeves in summer while riding my mountain bike on rugged trails. Your risk/benefit analysis may yield different results than mine... but that's how it looks from this end. 

Even if the frame is repairable, you should consider the forces that it experienced which led to its bending in the first place. Steel--and these Firenze frames were steel, Chromo-oly, I think--will accept a fair bit of abuse and isn't as prone to catastrophic failure as aluminum. I have had steel frames break, though--and it always happens at some point where the metal was stressed. If this bike has been through the wringer enough to bend it "incredibly", then even if you fixed it, the problems would not end there. One day, you'll ride along an notice a new sway in the frame if your lucky... then you'll notice that the downtube is cracking at the shifter braze-ons. Or maybe you'll hear a squeek and notice that one of the seatstays has detached itself from the seattube... there are just too many variables for it to be WORTH what it would cost to even replace a tube as whatsisname reasonably suggested. These bikes were giveaways. If it fits you well, you know what you are looking for. Measure the bike so you know what size it is, and start hunting on ebay and on www.bicyclebunker.com for your new ride! At bicyclebunker, you can find pretty much whatever you want. You just have to negotiate with a seller on shipping. Get rid of that thing or make it into an art-piece! 

There are two answers. If this frame were sitting in my garage and the geometry was such that I thought I would like riding it, I'd probably set it up as a fixie--run it around town for a while. Later on, I might get a hair up my butt and put a derailleur and a new crankset on it--make it into a totally different bike. It's a nearly blank canvas--have fun with it! 

Tag-along trailers are nice because they allow your child to PARTICIPATE in what we all know is a great experience--a bike ride. The problems with tag-alongs are listed in Jay's response. I think the WEEHOO is hella cool. It's similar in function to the tag-along trailer that you mentioned, but the child's position is RECUMBENT. The child sits lower on a WeeHoo than on other tag-alongs which is better for balance. There are pedals so the kid can feel like he/she's helping. If the little one gets tired of pedalling, they can sit back and fall asleep! It's great for little kids. Our LBS carries this. It is also on the web at $URL$ 

I have a folding bike that, in order to fold completely, needs to have a quick-release seatpost. Unfortunately, in order for it to be comfortable, it also needs to have a fairly nice saddle (Brooks B67). In order to protect my saddle, I use a two-foot-long piece of 1'4" nylon-sheathed steel cable. On one end, I have it permanently fixed into a loop around the seatstay with an aluminum ferrule. The other end is permanently fixed into a loop around the rail of the saddle with another ferrule. A thief could certainly pop that cable and walk away with my seatpost. I think it just as likely for a thief to have a pair of bolt-cutters as an allen-key, though--and my saddle is only afixed to the bike with an allen screw even if you set aside the quick release. The total cost of that setup is about $5. Tools required include a cable-cutter, razorblade, crimping tool (or an anvil and hammer). My wheels on that bike are bolt-on. My other bikes, I use Pinheads, as @ChrisW suggested. I have been happy with the Pinheads. Their price is worth it to keep my good wheels around. 

I spent the last two years as a backcountry ranger, in Northern California. There, I wore a backpack almost every day. Now I am a bicycle commuter in Sacramento and I choose panniers first, a messenger bag second, and the backpack a distant third. There are three reasons why the backpack is my last choice in this list. 

Things like this are out there. Look at the suppliers of mountaineering clothing as well as cycle manufacturers for innovative use of contrasting fabrics for ventilation. I have an older model of this jacket: $URL$ It treats me pretty well--wind-proof front, but with fleecy breathable arms and back. I believe that, in Canada, MEC carries Patagonia clothing. 

Everyone must start somewhere with every hobby, right? Maybe this isn't the perfect bike for street-acrobatics, but it's not a bad place to start--to begin to get the technique that the other answerers are describing. Ride this one and know that with every drop, you're both shortening the bike's life and increasing your level of experience. Everything has a price, eh? A bike that is never ridden but safely stored will last a very long time. A bike that is well maintained but ridden aggressively will only last a few seasons on rough terrain (I weigh over 200#). It's a tradeoff that we have to make--but it is important to do so conciously, to avoid wasting a perfectly good bike on a move that won't teach you anything!

A couple of months ago, I purchased an OnGuard link-plate lock which claims to be as tough as some u-locks. It mounts easily to the bicycle and has thus far served me well. It feels pretty durable and will go around more potential anchors than a u-lock. Mine came with a plastic case that attaches to the downtube using velcro straps. It looked kinda cheesy right out of the package, but I must say that I use it every day and it has been just fine. Here's the manufactuer's description: $URL$ 

Honestly, I must say that there is no such thing. Sometimes you can find a U-lock used on Craigslist or similar websites and you might get a better deal. Otherwise, $30 is below bottom-of-the-ladder for U-locks. And think about it. What are you paying for with that 30-50-even $90? It's a one-installment insurance policy on your bicycle. I would suggest that you lay down some real money and get a good lock. If you don't, you can either
