Are you talking about a "six pack"? That's essentially one muscle, called the Rectus Abdominus. They are always there. You can induce hypertrophy, an increase in size (of the muscle cells), but that's limited. As someone stated in another post, abs are built in the kitchen before they're built in the gym. As a strength professional, I lean away from sits ups and similar exercises because that's more hip flexion than it is core work. Planks are your friend. You'll hit your core during EVERY exercise, and it's impossible not too. It's essential for stability. Keep that in mind-if you decrease stability (closer stance, bosu ball), you'll increase 

The reason your spine hurts is because the hip flexors, typically used during sit up style exercises, are attached to your spine. Your core is hanging on for its dear life during extended sit up style exercise regimes in order to save your back. Over 800 newtons of force are placed on the attachment points in the spine during sit ups. If you want to mitigate that, execute a Mcgill sit up-one leg extended, one leg bent. Ensure that when executing a crunch, you only perform 30 degrees of flexion in the spine. Shoulder blades should leave the deck, but at no point should you be "sitting up". I'm going to agree with others here in saying that there are many exercises that utilize the core anyway-if you're doing it right you don't really need to focus on the core. I ensure that when prescribing, my clients do not have too much sit up style exercises. Planks are king, not sit ups. Planks don't involve spinal flexion. 

Uh, no, they aren't worth your ROI. The main purposes I see in Vibram Shoes is to strengthen the supporting lower leg muscles and to change your running gait to put you more on your toes. Vibram shoes are training tools within themselves. The shoes should be worn progressively similarly to how you would progress a workout -> maybe 10 minutes a day this week and then 15 minutes a day the next week and then maybe a 15 minute run in the 3rd week, etc. You get the idea. For running they improve form (when properly & slowly introduced) and improve supporting structures (ankles, ligaments, calves, etc.). So for weight-lifting ONLY, I see them as being nothing more than a conversation piece between sets. 

Definitely could be shin splints. Here are 4 ways to alleviate shin splints. 1) Do the alphabet with your feet. Sit down and pretend your foot was a marker. Make a capital "A". Make a capital "B". etc. Do with right leg and then the left. 2) Take off your socks and stand over a bathroom towel. Use your toes to scrunch up the towel as though you were trying to pick it up. Do 20 reps per foot. 3) Do calf raises -> stand up and from a flat foot position, raise onto your toes. Pause for 1 second, come back down to flat footed. Do 15 reps with equal weight on each foot. 4) Do heel raises -> stand on a step and hang your heel off the edge. Let your heels dip below your toes. Pause for 1 seconds and then raise back up so your feet are horizontal. do 15 reps with equal weight on each foot. Do these every other day. Start with 1 set of each and increase until you get to 3 sets. Once the pain goes away (maybe 3 weeks), you can reduce to 1 set every other day. Best of luck and good running. EDIT: Here is an article with more detail and 3 more ways to Cure Shin Splints from Running 

It was briefly touched on in another answer, but it really comes down to fundamentals. Too often we think we can just throw a kid into a sport and expect a certain level of performance when the reality is they'll still be developing neuromuscular movement patterns. The number one thing you could do for your kid is focus on fundamental movement patterns. Marching, skipping and bounding are going to do more for your child than anything else in this developmental stage. If they can't march well, whether that be laterally or linearly, then we can't expect them to run well either. And stay away from fast footwork. Agility drills are notorious for making soccer players move their feet fast but not their bodies. 

This is a very common question, and what you're asking about is spot reduction. Bottom line is, spot reduction is a myth. You likely have more KG of fat than you think-5kg equates to .06 percent, which is extremely low-that's venturing on hospitalization if true. I will echo others here-trim bodies are built in the kitchen just as much as they are in the gym. Have faith and remained disciplined about your diet and exercise, as long as they are realistic and healthy. You can lose that fat, but only if you remain diligent. 

Do bird-dogs without lifting your arms. From the quadruped position, lift one leg straight back so it is parallel to the floor. Lower it back to the ground. Repeat with the other leg. For maximum results, place a dowel rod on across your lower back and do the exercises without the dowel falling off. Focuses on activating glutes without rotating hips. Can do 100 of these a day as this is neuromuscular (activating) and produces best results with maximum volume. Do 1 legged bridges but with your knee held to your chest. Lay on your back in a situp position. Pull one knee to your chest and hold it tightly in place. Squeeze your glutes (not hamstrings) and lift up into a bridge position so shoulder to knee is a straight line. Hold for 3 seconds. Lower. Repeat. This is a strengthening and activating exercise but it can cause strain on the lower back and hamstrings if not done correctly. Start with 1 set of 5 to each side. Increase up to 3 sets a day once you are ready. Once you can handle 3 sets a day, increase the reps by 5. For stretches, do the newspaper stretch. Hold for 3 minutes per side in order to lengthen the muscles. 30 seconds will make you feel better but more time is needed to actually lengthen the tissue. Good luck. 

Not sure why this is getting downvoted, but there is no surefire, fast, "urgent" way to get healthy. There are no shortcuts to becoming healthy or fit. Thinking otherwise is dangerous. This is also a very difficult question to answer, because it's vague. But the bottom line is, eat healthy, and become more active. Learn more about healthy nutrition from reliable (Not Dr. Oz) sources. Learn what your body should be consuming-remember that it doesn't have to be bland to be good for you. And if you're sitting on the couch for more than an hour a day without budging, for the love of Pete get up and start walking. Sitting is the new smoking. Keep that in mind. Sedentarism kills. Find an evidenced-based personal trainer that focuses on health. Trainers that focus on "feeling the burn" may not be a good choice for you. Talk to cardiac rehab centers for references. Talk to local community colleges. Try out the YMCA-health based training is better than most for your particular situation. You need quality help. 

I am a 42 yr old male. About a month ago I finished a running program that has me now well adapted to running 3 times a week for half an hour (the famous C25K, non-commercial and freely available at www.nhs.uk). I have done no other exercise in the last year. My body seems to be craving more physical exercise and I have started mixing different activities that (hopefully) don't overlap: swimming (above 700 m in each session) and callisthenics (twice a week, a simple pull/push routine called "New Blood"). I am afraid of injuring my heart or something. Is it bad to exercise almost everyday at my age? This has been my last week: Day 1: I swam 750 metres Day 2: Calisthenics (Push) Day 3: Again 750 metres Day 4: Rest Day 5 30 minutes run Day 6: Calisthenics (Pull) Day 7: Swimming 750 m again The sudden increase in exercise has me sleeping well, with good appetite and very good humor (yep, endorphins release or something). But I don't know if I am risking a heart attack or something. Note: I had a cardiologist check about a year ago and everything was fine.
