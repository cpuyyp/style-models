I think this repetition is not by accident. Early on, Anna wonders whether Karenin's ears stick out because of a hair cut. Later on, the narrator observes that Vronsky's hair has grown "half over his ears". I think this attention to ears and hair cuts is a little symbolic. Perhaps Karenin's ears stick out because he hears everything, and listens to everything he hears. His hair is short (which we may infer from the above passage) because he cares about appearances. On the other hand, Vronsky lets his hair grow out, and toward the end it is reaching his ears. Vronsky is aware of the chatter about his affair, but he chooses not to listen. He cares less about appearances. Vronsky's hair serves to conceal, whereas Karenin's serves to uncover. Vronsky conceals his bald spot by brushing back his hair (pt. 5, ch. 7). Karenin's short hair uncovers the awkwardness of his ears, and the awkwardness of the whole affair. The idea of a bald spot as a blemish in his life of which Vronsky thinks too lightly, makes it the perfect symbol for his affair. Although it might cause other men insecurity, it doesn't make Vronsky insecure. He is far too confident for that. He is careless and cheerful about what other people notice and attend to. It's also worth pointing out, in the passage from pt. 2 ch. 20, the juxtaposition of the bald spot and the mare. 

Executive summary: the sparrow is the lover, and the robin is the child [thank you @PeterShor for cutting through the undergrowth]. Which might well invalidate my interpretation below :o) Why a robin? If you go here you'll find a link to a sample of robin birdsong, with the narration [emphasis mine]: 

I'll leave the Freudian interpretation of those authors’ apparent disgust of coitus to the reader³ ... 

¹ C S Lewis used a selection of Greek words for “love” as the foundation for his book The Four Loves, and rebuts the criticism of ’erōs as a “selfish” love. It’s worth noting that he’s talking about romantic love rather than only sexual desire in general. ² Each poem was accompanied by rather elegant illustrations, mainly “nature-themed”. See below. Larger version here. ³ Where do they think the child came from? 

That's why The Last Battle doesn't bring it up. Re Lewis: presumably, Susan grieved for her family. She may even have turned to religion in her grief, which would bring her back towards the path to Aslan's country, though Lewis said would be a longer journey for her. However, that doesn't change the fact that the reason she's still alive is that she's, erm, a teenager who likes nylons and lipsticks rather than Aslan--that's what makes her "silly" according to Lewis, that state of mind; not her reaction to a specific event. 

Expanding from my comment. Warning for disturbing themes and also a lot of links to fairy tales. "Seasons of Glass and Iron" pulls from several fairy tales. It looks to me that variations on The Princess on the Glass Hill, The Enchanted Pig, and The Black Bull of Norroway are most prominent--however, there are references to many others scattered throughout. Tabitha thinks of her brother with winged sandals, and of women forced to wear "shoes of glass; ... shoes of iron heated red–hot." Amira references "words of desire [that] tumbled from men’s lips like diamonds and toads," and "a story about nettle shirts thrown up to swans." Therefore, I think it's reasonable to look at other fairy tales for inspiration as to what the king and Amira could have meant. Here's what we know his requirements are: 

Fathers often tell their sons or daughters what to do, and the Ghost is acting no differently. The Ghost puts quite a lot of pressure on Hamlet when he says this. In case you don't know, Lethe is a river in Greek mythology that, when drunk from, eases one of all their memories and sufferings. By making this comparison, the Ghost is goading Hamlet into action. Now, consider the rest of the speech. 

What do you think the Ghost might be lying about? Claudius definitely murdered his brother, which we find confirmed in the play-within-a-play (act 3 scene 2), and by Claudius's own confession (act 3 scene 3). However, it's true that the Ghost might not be Hamlet's father. In that case, it would still have to know the details of his father's death, and the details of his father's life. Perhaps it is some infernal spirit who has this knowledge. This is actually a very interesting question. I think there is no definite answer to this question. It's ambiguous. But it is worth asking questions about the Ghost's intent. Consider these words from the Ghost. 

What's the difference between the sparrow and the robin? It seems likely Blake's intent was to show how two people in apparently identical circumstances can seem very happy or very sad. Given the odesmith’s approach to life, the title of the collection, and the context (a lot of relatively “clean” sexual imagery exists in the rest of the poems) this may be contrasting blithe, naïve, youthful spirits with sad and wiser men like Coleridge’s wedding guest. Nowadays we might call the latter jaded. Comparison with The Clod and the Pebble. This may be compared with its companion poem, The Clod and the Pebble, which also illustrates two opposing responses to the world and to “love” in particular. I think that case is slightly different, largely because it’s clearer there why the responses are different. The clod speaks of what the Greeks¹ termed agápē (ἀγάπη), and the pebble of what they dubbed érōs (ἔρως), but the pebble deprecates the latter by implying it is selfish. Other opinions a.k.a. remember please always to call it “research”. I think anything beyond that is too debatable (I've had a quick Google search and found two almost diametrically opposed analyses) to commit to a single concrete answer… At one end of the spectrum are the rather down-to-earth views of the poem’s imagery (the whole natural cycle-of-life thing, with commentators varying in their perceptions of how full the glass is). For example, a description of the poem on a popular Cliff's Notes–style website says 

I think there is indeed symbolism in Vronsky's bald spot. One of Karenin's chief characteristics is his ears, which is often the first thing people notice of him. Ears are meant for hearing—hearing rumors, gossips, scandalous affairs. Whereas a bald spot is something that people often conceal. It could easily symbolize an adulterous relationship. Consider this scene at the military camp, in which an officer calls to Vronsky as he leaves his Finnish hut. 

($URL$ I'm only interested in the first stanza for now. I have mixed feelings about the first stanza. I like the image of decrepit age being something tied to a dog's tail. It really serves to show how foreign age is to the poet's soul; it is simply not a part of him, but something he tows along. I like the idea that age excites his imagination more, but when its song is dormant he must content himself with an old friend — Plato or Plotinus, interesting reading choices. He seems to be saying that Plato and Plotinus come in handy until the imagination is ready to soar. But then, when the poet is ready to sing, when the imagination is ready to soar, there is no song, no beauty. Only this alternate possibility that things will go wrong, and the poet will be derided by a "battered kettle at the heel". What does this phrase even mean? I can only think of a tea kettle. Why would it be battered? What image is he trying to show? What point is he trying to make? 

(Please note: I'm not a expert in Christian/Lewis in particular's theology; this is my impression primarily from the text of the book.) Peter, Edmund, Lucy and the rest don't know they're dead until the very end of The Last Battle. At the time the discussion of Susan occurs, everyone--including the reader--thinks they simply were pulled through another portal to Narnia, right before, during, or instead of the crash. Peter thinks that Susan didn't come with them because she's no longer a friend of Narnia and didn't come on the train + through the portal with them, not because she's still alive. (The real reason is both, of course.) 

So, it's reasonable for no one to say "here's how Susan is reacting to the death of her whole family", given that, well, her family doesn't know they all died. They expect to go back to our world. The last time they saw Susan, they were all alive and Susan was "silly." (Note: Lewis's opinion, not mine, etc.) The omnicient narrator doesn't bring it up at the time because at that point, the reader is also not supposed to know this. The revelation that they're in Heaven doesn't happen until the very, very end of the novel (literally the second to last paragraph), at which point there's enough grand-scale wrapping up to do, and enough on the characters' mind, that the narration doesn't return to Susan. 

He goes on to point out the obvious imagery in the arrow and cradle narrow. At the more spiritual, symbolic, ethereal, wispy end of the spectrum, we have this article from the now-defunct Colby Quarterly. It begins by lambasting the “sexual imagery” interpretation, with the scathing if somewhat pathetic critique: 

In this case God is speaking to the serpent in the Garden of Eden; the "he" is speaking of Eve's descendants (any and all of them) and hence including, in the story, Ransom. Weston thus represents - well, is - the metaphorical serpent. 

In other words, a celebration of that ethic, rather than cynicism. This blog post suggests a rather more “adult” reading: 

I'm tempted to say this belongs on ELU, but ... Almost. It's not clear what the husband thinks, but I'd say it's implied that he's blissfully ignorant. A more prosaic rendering would be “it's only [her] husband who doesn't know that she is a wh-re”. 

One of Vronsky's comrades, probably an officer, admonishes him to pay attention to his grooming. Wise advice! But does Vronsky really mind this advice? I don't think so. Because later on we learn that Vronsky never got that hair cut. 

First, the Ghost breaks the earth-shattering news that Hamlet's uncle killed his father. Then, he tells him not to be rash, nor let this taint his mind. But it clearly does taint his mind. After all, Christian values teach us to forgive, not to take revenge. The Ghost is advocating revenge. And that is the chief ambition of the Devil. So, if the Ghost is Hamlet's father, then he is certainly not purifying himself by coming back as a spirit and enticing his son into revenge. That's called temptation. It's fair to question whether this really is Hamlet's father. But I think the play rightfully does not focus on this question. Instead, it focuses on Hamlet's agency, given what he has heard. In summary, the Ghost speaks truthfully about the murder of Hamlet's father, but it's ambiguous whether the Ghost actually is Hamlet's father. It could be some demon, or the Devil himself. I think it's worth asking why the Ghost says what he does, and advocates what he does. But ultimately, the play is about Hamlet's struggle to find his way out of the maze he ends up in. To revenge himself seems wrong, but not to revenge himself seems equally wrong. He has a hard predicament, and it's enlightening to see how he finally achieves peace. 

Whereas, for example, The Cambridge History of English Literature (though it refers to The Blossom merely in passing) has this to say: 

The this refers to the preceding phrase or dialogue; crossly means gruffly or with ill grace. The repetition is purely for emphasis. The meaning, from context, is that people who live along the big highways resent the traffic. In the first case, although many of them are more than willing to sell produce, or a painting, to the passing motorists (represented metaphorically as the cars themselves rather than the drivers) in order to have a share of the affluence possessed and represented by the city folk, they are less willing (you can keep your money) to do so when the impatient motorist relieves their frustration by whining at the proprietor (being mean). In the second case, the motorist is asking desperately for help in some random location, short of gas, and hoping against hope that one of these rural dwellers has a supply of fuel of which they can spare a little (and are not begging, but asking to buy it). The askee is again grumpily responding, but presenting the asker as foolish to expect such a thing, and (perhaps a little unfairly) questioning their observational skills. The final stanza is a confession that the author isn't superior to the country folk after all. 

He also doesn't spin Amira's "ball so the men can find husbands" suggestion into a competition for her hand--in fact, Amira is the one who brings up the idea of her being a prize in a contest. So, what could he mean? My suggestion (though it's a guess only, of course): the king could marry Amira himself. This meets all his requirements, would almost certainly be considered "unspeakable" by Amira (and disgusting by Tabitha, when she reacts later), and is a motif found in several other fairy tales. Donkeyskin and The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter are two of the most prominent, but there are a variety of stories that involve this--usually because the daughter is the only one beautiful enough to fulfill some sort of condition. However, as this story is pretty explicitly about the patriarchy and various people's roles in it, I think it makes sense that the king's reasoning would be changed a little here, especially as he's shown to take pity on and emphasize with the men re his daughter's "irresistibility," as well as to meld with the other tales more seamlessly.
