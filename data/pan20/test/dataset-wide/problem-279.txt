Grand Absorber needs fuel: Grand Absorber can absorb another item to acquire new effects OR you can use it to gain more magical fuel to power the magic the Grand Absorber already has access to Grand Absorber has limited versatility: Grand Absorber can only remember a few spells or one spell at a time or only the most few recent spells absorbed or Grand Absorber memory is bounded by tiers of magic it is storing. Grand Absorber time limit: After your Grand Absorber has eaten a new item, there is only a limited number of time (you can spam a spell 24/7 for a month for example) or the spell can only be cast X number of times Grand Absorber is intelligent and greedy: Grand Absorber isn't too fond of freely handing you a crap ton of magic that it has absorbed. You're going to need to pay a price (this could be anything from your memories/gold/lives of loved ones) as tribute if you wish to use the magic Grand Absorber is TYPE limited: Your Grand Absorber can only take in spells of certain schools at a time. For instance your Grand Absorber can only eat magical items that are part of the evocation school. If a user wants to store a new type of magic (like swapping to abjuration/transmutation), the user has to drop all the spells the Grand Absorber uses. 

The mass of a single habitable planet is small relative to the mass of a solar system. Slightly less so if you eliminate the star. Taking that planet apart to provide more orbiting solar collection is relatively unimportant -- in our solar system, the mass of the Earth would be a rounding error. If we did have a incomplete Dyson sphere (from disassembling the other planets), the amount of time we'd be blocked from the sun, and the power needed to generate a "flashlight" that would replace the sun during that time, is pretty low. Assuming that the incomplete Dyson sphere blocks the sunlight no more than it would if it was randomly constructed, only 0.000000001% of the energy it collects would be required to be emitted by a "solar flashlight" to replace the sunlight that it blocks from reaching the Earth. There may be inefficiencies here, but we have lots of zeros to eat up said inefficiencies. Note that using more energy on Earth than we receive from the Sun is relatively infeasible without building geological scale radiators: keeping a high-energy civilization cool on a plant is tricky. You could deliver it more efficiently than the above "solar flashlight" plan, and the blocking of the sun's rays by the partial Dyson sphere might be well worth it. I speak about blocking the sun's light as being a problem, as that is about the only one I can think of from having a Dyson Sphere between the Earth and the Sun. Mass wise, the entire rest of the solar system being used to construct a Dyson Sphere within Earth's orbit wouldn't cause any orbital issues: Jupiter is 0.1% of the Sun's mass, and the rest of the solar system is dross. A 0.1% increase in the sun's effective mass might be detectable, but I doubt it would be significant. 

You always win!: Your speedster can play almost any skill game and either be amazing (playing FPS/ any traditional sport/martial arts) or cheat to victory (playing poker and peeking at opponents hands/move an opponents darts midair if playing darts/get the answers to test by running around a room) etc... This might contribute to confidence in many social events such as bars, carnivals, street pickup games allowing your speedster to shine in many areas while putting in a lot less effort than normal folk. Ring of Gyges: There is an argument to be made that your speedster might have to deal with a lot of moral issues. Assuming your speedster is the only one she can steal, kill, commit petty acts such as putting individuals in awkward position (trip/draw on someone's face/undress a coworker at work until they are fired) without impunity. She couldn't even be perceived. Having the speed ability is a burden or a vice. Dealing with the cost of time: Your speedster can interact with many people face to face with basically no lag time in terms of getting to an individual. Your speedster has also had a life where most of the time she can ask herself "Oh if I want X task to be done, I'll just do it really quickly and I still have my whole day ahead of me". Cleaning/traveling/maintenance/possibly her job can all be optimized by going faster. It might be frustrating that hanging out with people consumes so much of her time when she can be doing other things. Consider going out on a date to the movies. She is probably accustomed to speeding up all movies and then perceives everything normally at relative speed so she can watch an entire movie in seconds. NOW when she goes on a date to the movies it's a huge time sink. In this way the power makes her very selective of the people/places/events she interacts with and perhaps even a bit impatient. Even hanging out with someone that speaks to slow can be a huge burden of time on the speedster. Anxiety/Guilt: Just because she can think faster does not make her think better. There may be some circumstances where she sees a problem, but is helpless to solve it. Panicking while the world is in slow motion. Worse yet, a circumstance where she could have solved the problem but only thought of the way in hindsight. For instance, if in the speedster's past a helicopter fell nearby her and only after it fell to the ground exploding she realizes she could have spun her hands real fast and lowered the helicopter to the ground slowly. Or perhaps some sort of Gwen Stacy situation Food: OK so here's how she should eat. She will typically eat a cheeseburger when she is hungry 3 * a day (cheeseburger is example, substitute for meals). So that is 1 cheeseburger every 28800 seconds. Every day she goes into super speed mode, run the following calculation (keep adding while doing it per day)=> **(relative seconds spent in speed * power level (0%-100%) * 86400) ** Whenever she breaks 28800 that's another cheeseburger she needs to eat. example 60 seconds * 100% power * 86400 = 5184000 => 5184000/28800 = 180 cheeseburgers consumed that day. She may need to eat a lot depending on power usage. There could be some social pressure to not eat around others. Your speedster could be seen to pig out all the time yet never gain any weight. Might cause suspicion rumors or contempt to arise. Self taught: Literally no one can keep up with your speedster. Even if the person knows a wealth of knowledge, the best thing a teacher can do is to just throw books at your speedster. Your speedster probably knows an insane amount of information at subjects she is interested in. The rate of speed that she can acquire info will quickly allow her to become a specialist in any field she desires. 

Sell the future. You are living in space, and have pulled it off in a relatively short time frame. This means your ability to grow is substantial, as suppiles for 100,000 people where not lifted on heavy-lift rockets. The limits of that growth is large. If you manage to colonize the asteroid belt, there is enough cubic there generate living space for 100s of billions of people. Finding unique things to export to the Earth is reasonable. But a society of 100s of billions is going to have huge amounts of export capacity even without unique things to export to Earth: just selling culture and science will do it. You sell the future by somehow selling shares in that venture. An exponential robot-driven industrialization of the asteroid belt together with a population explosion among the existing 100,000 citizens places the 100 billion population point at about 300 years away. If you simply manage to maintain current wealth and export capabilities, that is a 4.7% annual growth rate. So sell shares. Shares in asteroid belt robot factories, shares in colony factories or colonies. Dividends of those shares then shares in the next generation produced by the first. Then use the money from the sale of shares to import needed goods from Earth. You have a greenfield industrial revolution. In 1670 the USA had 100k people. By 1970 it was a world superpower. It did this on the backs of immigration, but much of its growth came from the fact there was an entire continent it managed to exploit over that time. 

If you watch the second video, the scientists can only shoot plasma around 2 feet. To the Marksman Dragon, range is definitely a status symbol. Your dragons might have drastically smaller ranges while young thus making the Marksman Dragon a much more parental dragon over the conventional dragon that doesn't typically need to shoot far. Or maybe the gift of "LongShot", as the Marksman Dragons call it, is a genetic trait that is sexually selected for. Video Example $URL$ More in Depth Video of some science behind $URL$ 

You want to sling spells like Glarnak and the rest of em cowboy? Well this lifestyle... it really ages you... You definitely want to drain the life force of the caster on this one. If you do heat or luck, you can run into the problem of always prolonging the cost ad infinitum(cold + luck spells). The cost to perform magic should be based on the strength of the life force of a caster. The more magic used, the more the caster is aged. Incredibly strong magic users would age slower per spell cast. You could even have it so that a spellcaster could burn through all his/her life force to increase the power of another spellcaster . Like a form of magic inheritance from parent to child. How the choice would reflect resistance as more energy or power is drawn for a spell. Energy required (whether kinetic, heat, whatever) * spell caster level (golf rules apply here the lower the value the better you are at casting ) = seconds/minutes/years/decades of your VERY LIFE. How the choice would create a measurable or predictable consequence turning people against magic. Obviously you don't want to turn to dust and turbo age yourself via spamming fireballs every 5 seconds. This system should make magic cost you and stop you from needlessly casting spells. You aren't going to use magic to pull weeds when you can literally SAVE yourself the time by not casting. How the choice would be deterministic, meaning the aforementioned consequence could be traced back to a specific action. Your magic can't rob UNWILLING life. when your magic caster is casting a spell, he/she needs to draw from there own years OR have someone use magic to transfer lifetime/magic capability. Also you can't dip into years you don't have access to. In the same way your muscles give out, if you start to lift a building of osmium, there will come a point where you age away and drop the building. 

Mine the lift-stuff. I asked the OP for clarification. Here is the response: $URL$ the core of each island is Active Aether infused rock (with debris and the like encrusted on it). This Active Aether is decaying. In primitive times, you can go to the edge of the island (maybe under the edge) and knock off rock attached to ropes or nets and weights. Sometimes the rock you knock off will have more Active Aether than dead weight, otherwise the opposite. High quality "lift rock" (with a higher than average Active Aether density) can then be used as the core of your ships. As the Gaia field is described as a flow, and gravity still seems to exist, and there is air resistance, you can tack. A thin sheet of high quality lift rock (even pulverized and bagged, or turned into cement to get the ideal shape) may be pushed harder by the Gaia field when facing "flat" against the flow, and less when turned to show a shallower profile. Throw in sails to resist air, propellers to turn physical effort into push, gravity pulling down, and careful control of such flaps, and you should be able to build an air-ship. But you want to know how primitive we can get. In more primitive times, lift-rocks will be found (some will "roll off" the bottom of the world), and with rope, nets and effort could be used to build bridges between floating islands. Before that, take a small lift rock and some fans. Tie yourself to the lift rock so you are neutral boyency. Add large foot and arm fans and bring lots of food. Fly yourself to another island. In short, there is a mechanism that keeps the island afloat. Humans would exploit that mechanism to keep themselves afloat, and add propulsion mechanisms to move around. With the islands floating around, these tactics would be used when islands get close. You'd invade another island or colonize it when you are close by, and hop from island to island over generations. The culture who masters these techniques spreads the furthest. 

Plasma Breath If you're looking for something quick, hot, and with pinpoint accuracy, look no further than good old plasma my friend. Instead of using weak dragon lungs to propel breath weapon, the illustrious Marksmen Dragon uses naturally evolved magnets (birds have magnets so why not dragons right?) to propel the burning plasma at the weaker dragons. How hot can you get? As long as the Marksman Dragon can get the energy, your dragon could breathe (is shoot more appropriate?) plasma at temperatures hotter than the sun. Even fulfills the cohesive beam requirement, here's a simple google image search for plasma jet 

You place one flying humanoid that acts as a guard and enforcer. Then put a money funnel on the top of the bus. The funnel drops the coins into the proper receptacle. Alternatively, you could have the driver sit on the top rear of the bus much like how a firetruck is driven. Your driver is here 

It would be easier to just build a large hydrogen bomb. Yellowstone is about a 875 gigatonne explosion. Tsar Bomba was designed 100 at megatonnes. There are little to no fundamental barriers to making a larger nuclear bomb than Tsar Bomba; it was made smaller and not repeated because large, single nuclear bombs are not useful in nuclear war. Just set of a 100+ gigatonne explosion buried at Yellowstone. Or really wherever you want. If you really want to work Yellowstone in, claim that a 10 gigatonne explosion should trigger the rest of the cascade explosion, setting Yellowstone off early at roughly half power. 10 gigatonne is only 100x larger than already designed nuclear bombs where. Something as simple as 100 duplicates of the Tsra Bomba design set to go off a the same time would work. Or, add another stage or two to get exponential return from a single bomb. Tsar Bomba uses a fission trigger to fuel a fusion reaction. They eliminated the 3rd stage of that being used on a fission tamper to release more energy. Simply replacing lead components with the designed uranium would bring it up to its full yield of 100 MT. Adding a 4th stage would be theoretically possible. As an example, imagine building a sphere of Tsar Bombas that focus their energy on a central fusion or fission target. This 4th stage could involve some exotic material, and part of the plot could involve this rich individual building breeder nuclear power plants, stockpiling this exotic material, and building an underground monitoring facility at Yellowstone. 

If you want to focus more on the psychology of having the speed power, your speedster should be able to use the power (both movement/speed perception) in a similar way that you use your muscles. 

If you are willing to handwaive away the issue of storing the chemicals and making sure it stays cold, you could freeze areas of skin via the use of liquid nitrogen. I'm envisioning one of the following. 

Magical Silk Harvest the silk from Glarnakian spiders. By placing the spiders upon your wings before battle, the spiders will weave an intricate netting of silk to block all arrows from piercing through. Due to the lightweight materials, you shouldn't have a problem maintaining flight while also blocking projectiles. 

There is a research paper about this subject although if you want more than the abstract, you'll have to pay for it. Although I am not a doctor, from my understanding, you Link to Article 

Poverty. The end of the industrial age resulted in most labor being surplus; the work you could do with your brain or your hands wasn't worth the resource diversion to feed you compared to just having an AI with a teleprecense robot or bioengineered meat-puppet do the work. So now we have legions of the poor. Their only hope for sustenance lies from the charity of those with resources, or providing services to people with resources that robots/meat puppets/AI cannot. As technology is incredibly powerful and planets are fragile, the halves are afraid the despair of the halve nots will destroy what they have. So ubiquitous surveillance blocking them from getting access to non-controlled technology is deployed. Controlled technology is managed by AIs loyal to the noble cast to prevent it from being useful against the noble caste. On the other hand, your ability to support peasants (or provide peasants with enough resources to self-support) is a status indicator among the nobility. And the more resources you can get them to provide you with (even though it is mostly worthless) the better you are at it. So you have peasants using restricted amounts of technology to work the land. The entire peasant system is a game the nobles play with the lives of the peasants, and viewed as more humane than genocide, because "what else are peasants good for?" The peasant class is not allowed to fly, or use projectile weapons. A castle on the ground is an effective defence against whatever they can do. Gentry classes also exist, playing more complex games. Knights who basically fight and die for the amusement of the nobles, courtiers who amuse the nobles, etc. There are nobles who have disconnected from the world, but such beings tend to fade into irrelevance; either they leave planets, or they build small fortifications/rockets (protected by treaty, which their AI constantly monitor) where they while away their days playing with virtual worlds. Some don't have much in the way of peasants yet still interact with the world sometimes; these wizards are quirky and dangerous to deal with. The nobles and their games are quite serious; but nobles who don't obey the rule of only permitting peasants controlled technology are subject to summary punishment by their own AIs. A good chunk of Magic (maybe all of it) is then controlled technology that acts in ways that don't really make sense, because it isn't supposed to. It can do far more than it does; its restrictions are arbitrary. Quite possibly even the nobles are just playing a game arranged by post-human intelligences, hence the stability of their pacts, using trivial amounts of resources from the post-human perspective. They think they are rulers of the universe, but are just peasants with a few more toys.
