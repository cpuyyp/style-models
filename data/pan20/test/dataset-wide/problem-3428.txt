Suppose several traders are given some initial endowment of goods. Then, a free market opens and they trade until the market is at a competitive equilibrium. Each trader now has a final utility which is at least as high as his initial utility. MY QUESTION: Is the vector of final utilities unique? I.e, is this possible that, with the same initial endowments and the same utility functions, there will be two different equilibria in which the final utilities are different? EXAMPLE: Suppose there are two goods and two traders, Alice and Bob, with the same utility function: $u(x,y)=x+y$. The initial endowment is $(10,0)$ for Alice and $(0,10)$ for Bob. In competitive equilibrium, the price vector has $p_x=p_y$. There are many different equilibrium allocations, for example: $(10,0),(0,10)$, $(9,1),(1,9)$ and $(5,5),(5,5)$ are all equilibrium allocations. But, in all these allocations, the utilities of both traders are the same: $(10,10)$. I would like to know in what cases this uniqueness happens. 

As denesp mentioned, your solution is incorrect. To check whether there is envy, you have to compare the two bundles from the point of view of the same agent. So in our case we have: 

While this question is mathematic, its motivation is economic. Given two people with strictly-convex preferences, we would like to represent their common preferences by a social welfare function. One natural way to do this is to represent each person's preferences by some strictly-quasiconcave function and take their sum. However, the sum of strictly-quasiconcave functions is not necessarily quasiconcave. So it is interesting whether we can always find specific representative functions such that the sum is quasiconcave? I already know that, without the "strictly", the answer is no. Here is an example: 

Different family members have different utility functions, but All family members consume the same bundle. For example, consider a family $F$ that has to select a bundle of funiture ($x$) and electronic equipment ($y$). Each member $i\in F$ has a different utility function $u_i(x,y)$. The family has a budget $I$. How can the demand of the family be calculated? I thought of several options: 

Consider an exchange economy with two goods, e.g. home furniture (x) and electrical equipment (y). The interesting thing about these goods is that, when a family owns a bundle, all members of the family enjoy the same bundle (it is like a "club good" but only for the family). There are two families. In each family, there are different members with different preferences over bundles. Assume that all preferences are monotonically-increasing and strictly convex. An allocation is a pair of bundles, $(x_1,y_1)$ for family 1 and $(x_2,y_2)$ for family 2. An allocation is called envy-free if: 

When there is no land-tilling, there is no depreciation and no insurance reception. Hence, only the 10.3 net domestic product is relevant, and from this we should extract the 1.0 insurance, for a total of 9.3. This should be multiplied by 60%, which is the relevant part of "crops" (since the other 40% are "animals" which can be grown as usual). We get: 5.6. take only the compensation for employee jobs (5.3), since only employees should be compensated (should the insurance receptions be subtracted?). Again multiply by 60% and get 3.2. in a different source, I found the fact that the total number of crop farmers is only about 7000. Assuming a gross annual income of 240,000, which a top decile income, I got to only 1.7 (billion). AFAIK, most farmers make less than that, so the actual figure should be even lower. 

NOTE: I have some basic (undergraduate) knowledge of topology. I have heard about "weak topology" but never heard of "weak* topology". I will be very thankful for a simple, intuitive explanation that will help me continue reading! 

Both definitions are reasonable. My question is: which definition is more common in the economics literature? 

Wikipedia explains the difference between products that are "gross substitutes" and products that are "net substitutes". However, the mathematical explanation doesn't give much intuition about these concepts. So my questions are: 

Suppose the government puts a tax on all apartment owners (e.g. a certain percentage of the apartment value), whether or not the apartment is rented. Will this tax cause an increase in rent? From an economics point of view, it seems the answer should be no (at least in the short run): the tax has no effect on the supply or the demand so there is no reason that the rent should change. If landlords could take a higher rent, they would do so now. If they don't take a higher rent, it means that they cannot do so in the current market conditions, so they will not be able to raise the rent even when there is tax. But from a psychological point of view, the answer may be yes. Why? Because landlords often don't raise the rent to the maximum possible level given the market conditions. Often, when a tenant rents an apartment for many years, the landlord prefers to keep the rent constant in order to keep good relations with the tenant. But, when there is tax, the landlords have an excuse to raise the rent. They can say "we are sorry, we would really like to keep the rent as it is, but we must raise it to cover the new tax". Are these considerations correct? What is more likely to happen in reality? 

Call a utility function $u(x,y)$ additive if there exist functions $v_x,v_y$ such that: $$u(x,y)=v_x(x)+v_y(y)$$ Consider the function $u(x,y)=xy$. It is not additive, but, it can transformed using a positive-monotonic-transformation (PMT) to the function: $u'(x,y)=\log u(x,y) = \log{x}+\log{y}$, and the function $u'$ is additive. My question is: what conditions on a function $u(x,y)$ guarantee that it can be transformed using a PMT to an additive function? I.e, if I see a function $u(x,y)$, how can I know whether it represents a preference relation which can also be represented by an additive utility function? 

$$(x_F,y_F) = \sum_{i\in F} (x_i',y_i')$$ Each definition probably has different implications on results such as competitive equilibrium, welfare theorem, etc. What is a good reference on this problem? 

Since the numbers in each calculation are quite different, I am interested to know what causes the difference, and which calculation should be used? 

A monopoly firm has an incentive to increase the price and decrease the produced quantity in order to increase its revenues. But this decreases the social welfare. The government can intervene in several ways, one of which is to set a maximum price for the product. Ideally, the price set by the government should be equal to the equilibrium price, because then the social welfare is maximized. However, in order to know this socially-optimal price, the government must know the cost curve of the seller. A monopolist seller might decide to hide the true cost curve and claim that the cost is higher than it is, in order to make the government raise the maximum price. MY QUESTION IS: what can a government do in order to approximate the socially-optimal price? I am interested in references to both theoretical suggestions and practical case-studies. NOTE: I am interested even in a very simple case, in which the monopolist's price per unit can be assumed to be constant, so that the only hidden information is that constant.
