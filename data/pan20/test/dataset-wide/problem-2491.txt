To my limited knowledge, in Zen, it is believed that anyone can be enlightened(if dedicated enough). Does everyone have this potential in other branches of Buddhism? Can everyone achieve this through meditation? Is this what is meant by Buddha nature? Is it exclusive to humans(is language necessary?) 

I too have felt some resistance, although it did eventually resolve. For one, try being more compassionate. For a long while I simply desired wisdom, and did so in a way that was neither mindful of the consequences of my actions(and how people felt about them) and had a sense of pride. Now I am practising more compassion, and its harder for negativity to phase me. Consequently, I am not trying to shield my ego from the negativity, instead I embrace it. Through companions sharing this, they provide insight into how I could help them better. It was only through realising how my actions were harmful(atleast from the perspective of my friends) to the relationships, that I was able to eliminate the misunderstanding. If you confront the ignorance, rather than purely ignore it, and practise compassion, you may find a more harmoneuous relationship. Of course there are people who will resist changing their attitude, such as someone who may be biased against Buddhism or any religious practise! In this case, try and see it from their perspective, and act in such a way to minimise their suffering. If they have no reason to suffer, your suffering should too reduce. I used to try and impose my attitude towards vulgar language upon others, but only through accepting the present nature of some people, and their use of such language, was I able to eliminate my suffering. I let go of my attitude, and it no longer bothers me. Good luck, hope you manage to find the trickly balance between practising yourself and being understood by others.

UPDATE to make the question more clear: The question is specifically about friendship with the Buddha himself (not general friendship on the path). I have chosen to call this friendship "spiritual" but maybe "virtual" or another word would be better, or another word that describes that the friendship is different from a person alive in the typical sense 

I could say more but I wanted to share what has worked in my own experience. I hope this will help you in some way Kind Regards, Tord 

I'm looking for more friends on the Buddhist path and would there for like to ask: Are there any social networking sites for Buddhists? Some features that I'm looking for: 

[This is a double question. I am unsure of Buddhism.SE in relation to posting to questions vs one per post] So today, Like many teenagers, I went to school, a place where I am surrounded by friends and challenges. Today there were many pleasant moments, both mentally, emotionally, and sensually. One thing that isn't unique to this day, is simply getting tired. Over the past few years, I've noticed that getting tired usually makes me more interested sexually, though I think this is either a longing for intimacy, or (more likely) experiencing normal sensory experience as more sensually, ever so slightly. During such episodes of routine tireless that occasionally arise, as is natural I crave sleep. Sleep seems like a pretty blissful state, in that it does not really experience any highs, nor lows. I've read that to not experience any desire is greater than fulfilling ones desires. Is this equality 'simply' achieved through mindfulness? How would you recommend pursuing this? I noticed that a distinctive attribute of pleasure is that generally, I don't want it to stop. Not that moderation is impossible, but its hard to draw a line with pleasure that is truly satisfying. Are some pleasures more satisfying? Or is the only path to satisfaction enlightenment, being detached from desires? 

His self. Once the self is given, it is realised that nothing is ever given nor taken. Giving or taking are just mere concepts ... illusions ... not truth. It is within this realisation of the truth that liberation is achieved. But again ... Achieving or not achieving are just mere concepts ... illusions ... not truth. It is within this realisation of the truth that liberation is achieved. 

Source: $URL$ Is it possible to attain Nirvana with such a belief/view? No. In order to attain Nirvana, this belief/view must cease. Once Nirvana is attained and after, this belief/view will cease. Why? Because when Nirvana is attained, craving ceases. Since the person who has this belief/view was immersed in craving, and this craving ceased, the belief/view will cease too and right view will arise. Nirvana is attained when craving is eradicated. Craving is eradicated when ignorance is eradicated. Thus, one must eradicate ignorance in order to eradicate craving. This same eradication of craving is Nirvana, which is attained by the arahat. Does an arahat strongly believe in no post-mortem rebirth and strongly deny the possibility of the existence of rebirth? No. Why? An arahat knows that rebirth has ended, but for not yet liberated beings rebirth continues. That's why an arahat can't strongly believe in no post-mortem rebirth and strongly deny the possibility of the existence of rebirth. Furthermore, the Buddha said that anybody who strongly believes in no post-mortem rebirth and strongly denies the possibility of the existence of rebirth is immersed in craving. Somebody who is immersed in craving is not an arahat. An arahat has eradicated craving. 

Most discourses that I've read have been given to monks or nuns (and not laypeople), so I'm wondering what the practical application is of these many discourses for a layperson like myself. Are the practices presented in these discourses something to strive for? Is it better (as laypeople) to focus our effort on deepening our understanding and practice of for example the five precepts? Grateful for help and with kind regards, Tord 

I'm wondering what the Buddha said about spiritual friendship with the Buddha himself. From SN 45.2: 

What else did the Buddha say about happiness for laypeople?. (Is there a compilation of teachings regarding this?) Grateful for help and with kind regards, Tord 

Context Other types of media (books, films, etc) can also have an effect on us. Plato thought that books were an assault on the person reading because the reader were not able to argue against the thoughts presented there Mindfulness and concentration However a difference is that the immersion is often bigger in computer games, in other words it's more difficult to maintain mindfulness and easier to be fully concentrated on the game. We easily "get lost" in this other world Content of the game Assuming that we are concentrated on the game and have lost connection with our body and mindfulness in general, the content of the game becomes extra important. Do we think it will be beneficial for us? What states of mind does it help to create and maintain? Many games contain violence or competition Some games create empathy and understanding of others, for example: 

Clinging or no clinging, it doesn't really matter, as it will stop when anatta will be realized in its entirety. Thus, work on the realization of anatta. For that you need a clear and calm mind. Once that is achieved, anatta can be easily realized in its entirety. 

1 When our ignorance is removed, our suffering ends. 2 When our suffering ends, the true nature of things is known. 3 When the true nature of things is known, the true nature of beings is known. 4 When the true nature of beings is known, the cause of suffering in beings is known. 5 When the cause of suffering in beings is known, the strive of beings to end suffering is clearly seen. 6 When the strive of beings to end suffering is clearly seen, our compassion for all beings arises. 

i've been trying to practice following the whole length of the in-breath and the whole length of the out-breath, and i can see that my attention often slips between the breaths. Any thoughts on what to focus on between two breaths? Grateful for help and with kind regards, Tord 

This way of thinking about them splits each of the first (metta, karuna, mudita) three into two parts, one for one-self and one for everyone else In Buddhism we don't want to make a harsh distinction between self and others but from a practical point of view this can (for example) help us to remember to have self-compassion. One downside is that there is a larger risk of not seeing our suffering as the suffering of others and the suffering of others as our own The last (upeksha) i have divided into two parts where the first is inner peace for oneself and the other is non-discrimination Question Is this (above) a practical way to think about the four immeasurables? (Practical in the sense of getting closer to living in line with them). Are there other ways to think about them that you can recommend and that can help us achieve living with them on a daily basis? (Please provide references to books or other materials if you can) Grateful for help and with kind regards, Tord 

Source: $URL$ The above statement is key. The above is exactly the purpose of Buddhadasa's and Buddhist teaching. It is to realize anatta. To see. To penetrate deeply into it. If this "ever-changing processes of concocting, of compounding, with nobody involved in them" would stop or continue after the annihilation of the physical body, Buddhadasa and other venerable Dhamma teachers would surely teach us so. But we can see that they don't teach us so. They teach us the opposite: to claim that this process stops or continues after the annihilation of the physical body is incorrect. They teach us that both of these views (stops or continues) are incorrect. To expound the truth why both views are incorrect, we should investigate it further: 

He taught that from ignorance, there comes birth. From birth there comes diseases (ailments or conditions affecting the mind) and intention (kamma) and all the rest. Please be aware that "birth" does not mean literal birth as we understand it. Also, "birth of being" does not mean literal being with a physical body as we understand it. It could be any birth, any being, any physical or non-physical body ... what is meant by birth, is merely a birth of self - the 5 aggregates. These 5 aggregates could be in any combination. The combination depends on ignorance. 

A positive perspective from a Buddhist gamer Jane McGonigal is a futurist, author and Buddhist who has written and lectured about the positive psychological effects of gaming Here is an excerpt from one of her lectures at a "Buddhist Geeks" conferance: Is Super Mario a Buddhist? Her tips for gaming: 

The external situation changed My thoughts, expectations and perceptions of the actions of other people changed 

I'm right now working on an application for increasing happiness in everyday life, inspired by practical teachings in Buddhism about happiness for laypeople. My question is: What did the Buddha say about happiness for laypeople? I have found these Sutras helpful: 

Gathas can be helpful for increasing awareness of daily activities and breathing. They are short practice verses/poems read silently while we synchronize the reading with our breathing. For example: 

You could do walking meditation or you could just meditate while doing something (a sport, painting, cooking, washing dishes, doing the laundry, etc.). If you are really busy, there is one more meditation that you can do: If you don't have time to meditate consistently, then make a habit of going to bed 10 minutes earlier. Prepare as if you would go normally to sleep. Lay in your bed. Lay on your back, legs a little bit separated, hands on your sides, some 10-15 cm from your body, fists opened, palms on your bed, fingers spread. In this position you won't fall asleep immediately because it's not a comfortable position to fall asleep. Once you are in position, empty your mind and meditate for 5-10 minutes (if you fall asleep before 5-10 minutes, there's nothing wrong with it, just go with it). Then turn in your favorite position and fall asleep as you normally would. Repeat the above for a few days. Then, do the same, but don't change position to your favorite position. Just lay on your back and meditate until you fall asleep. The later you fall asleep the better as your meditation session will be longer. Don't worry, you won't feel sleepy when you wake up because your mind will rest during meditation. Meditate as described for as many days, months as you wish. If you wake up during the night and can't sleep, meditate as described. If you take a nap during the day, meditate as described. Also, try to meditate a few minutes immediately after you wake up. Just lay in your bed and feel your mind relaxed and empty. Enjoy. While doing this kind of meditation, before you fall asleep or immediately after you wake up, you will notice many unusual sensations arising in your body. You could hear things, see colors, feel vibrations, have lucid dreams, fly, travel to other dimensions. If it happens, don't worry, don't intellectualize, relax and enjoy the experience. Once you get comfortable meditating as described, you will realize that there is something in you that is yet unknown. The unusual experiences will confirm you the existence of this yet unknown "you" or "something". This will hopefully motivate you into exploring this yet unknown "you" and you will move to sitting meditation spontaneously.
