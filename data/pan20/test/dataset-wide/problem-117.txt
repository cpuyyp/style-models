The short-reds were fast-moving but blocky--even jagged--a'a lava. The long-reds were the runnier and slower-moving pahoehoe lava. 

Remember, our median surface temperature is currently 58.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Would these three changes listed above lower the median surface temperature, or would it be the same? 

In the great apes, there are two worlds--ground and treetop. Representing the ground is the largest primate on Earth, the genus Gorilla. Representing the treetops is genus Pongo, the orangutan. 

In recent years, we have discovered exoplanets that defy our traditional perspectives on how planets work. WASP-17b is twice as wide as Jupiter, yet half as massive, probably because of its orbital proximity to its sun. Saturn itself is very confusing. It is second to Jupiter in diameter and mass. Despite that, Saturn is the lightest planet in the solar system, at only 0.687 grams per cubic centimeter. Its atmosphere is 75% hydrogen and 25% helium--could this have played a part in determining Saturn's record density? So in the event that some worldbuilder creates a five-billion-year-old alternate Jupiter that is 11x greater in mass (much like HD 106906 b) yet lighter in density and still in orbit 483.8 million miles from the sun, would the overall structure be realistically sound? Would a super-Jupiter with an atmosphere 75% hydrogen and 25% helium help reduce its density to below regular-Jupiter? 

In a manner of speaking, yes. Recently, we have found evidence that the blue eye gene stemmed from the random mutation of one individual. Random mutation is the key to the bulk of ethnic geodiversity here. Contrary to popular belief, for example, it was agriculture, not latitude, that created the Caucasian and Mongoloid paleness. If it were latitude, the evidence would have shown us a case of human whitewashing far older than eight thousand years. The reason for the more likely connection between whitewashing and agriculture is that plant foods don't have much of the vitamin D that a dark skin needs. 

I am in pursuit of, as the title says, a multi-purpose horse, a single breed that can do all the things that the others were only specialized for: travel, labor, companionship, war, speed, strength. If dog-breeding is any indication, it's that finding the right mix takes some steps. So we start this journey with two fairly similar breeds of horse adapted to the same basic climate: 

The most major mountain ranges in the world have proven themselves to be distinctive. This distinctiveness is made possible only by a recent history of being sculpted and resculpted by ice. 

One of the most enduring and effective weapons of human history is the bow and arrow. The oldest archaeological evidence of this weapon is 10,000 years ago. That's a pretty young date compared to Out of Africa, which varies between 125,000 and 50,000 years ago. By then, the only projectile weapon they had was the spear. Effective, maybe, but not without its problems. For one thing, you're throwing it with one arm, which does not provide stability compared to holding the bow on one hand and pulling the arrow on the other, which provides better control. So if humans invented the bow and the arrow BEFORE leaving Africa, would the course of human culture be affected? If so, how? 

The Aden Bahçesi mountain range in Africa is 21,810 feet above sea level at the highest and the result of a collision between Lemuria (east of the brown line) and mainland Africa that has been ongoing for 45 million years. East of the brown line is plateau. 

Looking at the topographical map of the two main islands of Britain--England to the east and Ireland to the west--is looking at two and a half million years of ice sculpting, grinding and melting on a repeating cycle. As proof, here is a map of the British Isles as recently as 18,000 years ago: 

Przewalski's Horse, once a common sight in the steppes of central Asia, then declared extinct in the wild in the 1960s before making a comeback as recently as the 1990s. In this alternate scenario, many thousands of years ago, it was this horse, not the tarpan, that men manipulated into the domestic horse that rode their masters on their backs. In comparison to tarpan-descended horses, what sort of anatomical and behavioral differences (if any) would I expect to see from a horse descended from Przewalski's? 

North America's largest and perhaps most popular volcano is the plume of mantle situated right beneath the surface of what we arbitrarily call Yellowstone National Park. 

Believe it or not, the diminutive but rough dwarf is the closest of all the humanoids to be biologically realistic. How? Let's look up Homo neandertalensis, the stereotypical caveman, in comparison with modern man: 

In what I hope to be the first episode of a series, I'm going to highlight each piece of Tolkien architecture and see whether or not it's practical enough to use in real life, starting with the simplest: Orthanc, the centerpiece of Isengard. The original Alan Lee painting right here. Tolkien actively described the tower as "a deep, gleaming black". In keeping true to the original description, WETA Workshop decided that Orthanc be made of obsidian, volcanic glass. 

I know that there are many questions about where to go to actually build your own world, where you can actually be your own god, totally visualizing your world's geography, geology and climate. But the thing is, my world is so similar to our Earth that it's not possible for me to rebuild a world from scratch. Are there any websites where I can find a map of the Earth and alter it in any way I wish? 

Here, it looks as though the islands of Tasmania, New Guinea and New Zealand have merged to become part of the continent. The brown lines are the Great Dividing Range, a series of volcanic peaks no taller above sea level than 18,500 feet. The next difference is Lake Eyre, a megalake over 460,000 square miles in area and 170.5 feet at the deepest. 

Truth of the matter is, the Bering had been shifting back and forth from land to sea for 100 million years. Here is Beringia in an alternate Earth: 

Today, one of Earth's many overbearing problems is overpopulation. The solutions are many. One of them is building new cities underwater. 

It definitely is black, which makes it qualified, and using obsidian to build Orthanc certainly helps in giving it a sharp, uninviting look. In the movies, the obsidian tower occupied by Saruman the White does look visually impressive, but the question is: Is it feasible, let alone practical, to construct a building out of obsidian? 

In this more realistic scenario than typical fantasy, the vampire is just an ordinary human being with a certain genetic quirk that results in the following: 

Like the Sahara, these four ecoregions must have had a much greener past. Southern Africa used to have Lake Makgadikgadi, a body of drinking water 50,000 square miles in area and 100 feet at the deepest. The following features are the fragmented survivors of Lake Makgadikgadi: 

Whales belong to the order Artiodactyla, the Odd-Toed Ungulates. The order is also exclusive to hippos, deer, camels, giraffes, pronghorns, antelopes, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and peccaries. (The differences between each other are so great that you would never notice that fact.) But in an alternate Earth, the whales belong to another group: 

One of the rarest but still most famous mineral on Earth's surface is gold. It has been used for luxury--Tut's funeral mask and the crown of Montezuma come into mind--and currency for thousands of years. But there is one feature about gold that intrigues me greatly--it is near-immune to corrosion. So with that feature in mind, can gold be used for more than just vanity or wealth? For example, if I melt a certain amount of gold to make up 1-5% of the steel alloy for construction of large buildings, would this be practical? 

252 million years ago, Earth underwent its worst, most violent chapter in the form of the Permian-Triassic extinction event, or "The Great Dying". 70% of the terrestrial species and 95% of the marine species became extinct. In the Earth Science Stack Exchange, I had asked why the Permian-Triassic Extinction event was known vernacularly as "The Great Dying", or why it took Earth ten million years to regain its complex, permanent ecosystems. The answers I got were that the Siberian flood basalt eruptions, though pretty dramatic, weren't the sole culprit. Ocean anoxism as a result of Panthalassa's relationship to Pangaea seemed also to play a part in delaying the re-oxygenation process: 

This super-sea that connects the alternate Asia to the alternate Atlantic, as it used to back home, averages 1205 meters in depth and has a maximum of 7,000 meters. Would these three changes bring a dramatic difference to the Indian Monsoon, or would it stay the same? 

One of the most overlooked elements of modern fantasy is that cold iron serves as either an effective shield or an effective weapon against supernatural creatures, like fairies or spirits. With that in mind, let us say that elvish smiths have found use of an alloy without involving iron at all. The other materials used in regular alloys--carbon and nickel--will still be used, but now they come with palladium, phosphorus, silicon, germanium, and silver. What will the elvish blades look like with those ingredients? Will they cut? More importantly, will they kill? Sidenote--I don't care how rare or precious any of these elements are because this is a question about quality, not quantity. 

As one can see, it's pretty much India, Bangladesh and Pakistan surrounded by the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. And this is Everest, the world's highest peak, standing 29,029 feet above the level of the sea. 

This building stands almost 2,000 feet above the ground and covers almost 17 million square feet of earth, with each clock face measuring a width of 150 feet. Using the resources and manpower of the times, how long would it take to build just one of these buildings? What materials and technologies would be used to hold them together? And how long would they stand in a Life After People? 

Instead, let's put those hands to good use--leaves, fruit, nuts, eggs and even insects. Traditional pictures put centaurs using modern horses. While I say we keep that traditional image, I propose that this not be the be-all-end-all. Some tribes would keep the ancestral three-toed design. Classical image often portrayed centaurs as being sexually unrelenting. Fortunately, biology can justify that behavior--just look up musth, a bi-annual condition in which a bull elephant's testosterone skyrockets, making him excessively aggressive. This next issue is for anyone who wants to write a romance fantasy between a human and a centaur. Traditional centaurs are simply too tall for interbreeding to be merely as burdensome as regular breeding. My proposal is this--make the average centaur four to six feet tall. Which means structuring the centaur less like a thoroughbred and more like a pony or, even better, an Icelandic horse (the only one to have a fifth gait, ambling, which made this horse the ideal traveling companion during the Middle Ages). (If you want to use the traditional thoroughbred, though, then go right ahead, but I'll warn you this--labor pains will reach critical.) The final issue that needs addressing is color. 

The reason Scandinavia is one of Earth's most distinctive peninsulae is the Baltic Sea, which is actually the result of glacial retreat during the Last Ice Age, so it wasn't a geologically ancient body. Indeed, evidence has found that before the Pleistocene, the Baltic Sea was actually the Baltic Plain. In this alternate scenario, the geological timeline of the Baltic Plain is as follows: 

Considering that each of the three volcanoes had different chemistries and compositions, would the timeline of the Dark Ages and the Middle Ages be identical, or would the really bad weather change every aspect of European history? 

Back home, the islands of Japan are created by the subduction of three separate plates--Eurasian, Philippine and Pacific. The result--Japan being the hottest spot for both earthquakes and active volcanoes. The lowest point is Lake Hachirōgata, down 16 feet below sea level. The highest point is Mount Fuji, standing 12,388 feet above sea level. As you can see from this map, coastal plains are plain to see, but volcanic mountain ranges dominate the nation. This is Japan in an alternate Earth: 

(Before anyone asks, this is related to the Sahara, Makgadikgadi and Himalaya questions.) The Sahara may take credit at being the hottest desert, but the Australian Outback is hardly a pushover by comparison. 

I have just been told that tar alone makes a good enough mortar because of its adhesive capabilities. This, however, does not change the fact that, since the Roman Empire, concrete has been the mortar of choice. Still, this brings up an interesting scenario. True to the spirit of Life After People, this scenario focuses on what happens to a building when we vanish rather than how we actually vanished. Even though Roman concrete stood the changes of 2,000 years, most scientists doubt that in a Life After People, skyscrapers built on modern concrete would last longer than 150 years. So in this alternate scenario, tar was the mortar of choice. For a building in a temperate climate built on bricks baked in an oven rather than by the sun (the former being more durable than the latter) and glued together by tar, how long would this building last in a Life After People? Does tar have what it takes to outdo concrete, or did the Romans make a wiser decision in inventing concrete? 

Fortunately, complex life--plants and animals--find ways to deal with these problems. As a result, Tibet is alive with wolves, bears, snow leopards, yaks, asses, antelope, cranes, vultures, hawks, geese and even snakes. Of course, the one Tibetan that stands out above the rest is a species aptly called the "high-altitude jumping spider". Now in this alternate Earth, Tibet is taller--6,000 meters above sea level on average, with the tallest point being 10,211 meters--33,500 feet--above sea level. At such heights, the three problems listed above become even more pronounced, which raises the pressure in regards to residing there. Can plant and animal life still flourish in this taller Tibet, or are our Tibetans currently living at the top of their limits?
