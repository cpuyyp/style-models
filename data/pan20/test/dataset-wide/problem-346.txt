some rivers end in a salt lake, salt flats or salt marsh. the water flows into the salty area, then evaporates away leaving behind the salt and other sediment. this area might not be called a "sea" if it isn't a large enough body of standing water. some rivers will flow "backwards" at high tide. nearly all rivers do this to some extent. they generally don't flow backwards long or hard enough to actually reach an area called a "lake". after earthquakes, it may take a short time for the sea to flow into a newly created depression. this situation generally resolves within a few days. 

it sounds like living humans are helpless against ghosts, but ghosts can fight each other. as such, ghosts would protect the living souls the way we protect children. similarly, i imagine ghosts would continue to own their property the same way that the elderly continue to own their property. they may not be able to physically stop you from taking it, but other living people will defend ghost's property rights to ensure their own property is not taken upon their death. if it is no more difficult to detect and punish soul theft than it is to detect and punish child abuse, then ghosts would probably be welcomed in polite society as well as any adult man. on the other hand, if detecting soul theft is much harder (e.g. because ghosts can walk thru walls), then ghosts might be banned from human settlements. even still, interaction would probably be peaceful. this answer assumes ghosts have normal human motivations. if you modified your question to suggest ghosts had an overwhelming hunger for souls, then the outcome would be quite different.... 

Although, Pliny the elder wrote that it may give you magic powers, but that has yet to be determined 

Magical Silk Harvest the silk from Glarnakian spiders. By placing the spiders upon your wings before battle, the spiders will weave an intricate netting of silk to block all arrows from piercing through. Due to the lightweight materials, you shouldn't have a problem maintaining flight while also blocking projectiles. 

Plasma Breath If you're looking for something quick, hot, and with pinpoint accuracy, look no further than good old plasma my friend. Instead of using weak dragon lungs to propel breath weapon, the illustrious Marksmen Dragon uses naturally evolved magnets (birds have magnets so why not dragons right?) to propel the burning plasma at the weaker dragons. How hot can you get? As long as the Marksman Dragon can get the energy, your dragon could breathe (is shoot more appropriate?) plasma at temperatures hotter than the sun. Even fulfills the cohesive beam requirement, here's a simple google image search for plasma jet 

Morally, this is going to be horrifying, but I think it would work. You don't assimilate the tribe. You assimilate the children of the tribe (the younger the better). Make the situation such that children don't have the possibility of learning about their "primitive" culture. Once your Midwestern Empire encounters a new culture the steps should be fairly simple. 

these are ancient traditions in nearly every culture for obvious reasons. in fact, many cultures consider children to be little more than property of their parents until they take a new name (e.g. during a rite of passage where a boy becomes a man, or when ownership of a woman is transferred during marriage). so, by naming the demon, you are assuming the role of it's parent, and therefore it must obey you (by divine law/natural order/etc.). also, it is worth noting that strangers are universally feared. and a stranger is loosely defined as someone who's name you do not know. e.g.: 

i don't think it would make any difference at all. a 30-40% strength advantage is absolutely devastating in 1-on-1 combat. 100-300% is simply overkill. women had very little political power until the "rule of law" took hold. after which, their relative physical strength was virtually irrelevant. 

because merfolk are cheaper than robots and machines can travel faster than humans. imagine you want to colonize a planet that is 10 light-years away. first you send your generation ship, but it will take 1000 years to get there because the human body can't accelerate very fast without dying. meanwhile, you send a colonization kit at nearly light speed. it arrives in 20 years and starts building a space port for you. unfortunately, you can't afford to send an entire space port, so you just send some robots that use the native resources to build a space port and stock it with food and other supplies. you also can't afford to send enough robots to do all the mining, smelting, constructing, farming, etc. so the first thing your robots do is build more robots. it turns out that on planets suitable for life, the most accessible resources to a tiny space probe are organic molecules. so the "robots" your probe builds are effectively tiny plants which generate the energy you need to fuel more complex machines. it then builds animals that are smart enough to build your space port. those animals are humanoid so they are easier to relate to, but they are aquatic so that when your descendants arrive they can colonize the land while the merfolk continue to live happily in the sea. indeed, you can even genetically program the merfolk to desire to build space ports but hate the idea of actually leaving the sea personally. it's like "brave new world" meets "a for andromeda" 

Grand Absorber needs fuel: Grand Absorber can absorb another item to acquire new effects OR you can use it to gain more magical fuel to power the magic the Grand Absorber already has access to Grand Absorber has limited versatility: Grand Absorber can only remember a few spells or one spell at a time or only the most few recent spells absorbed or Grand Absorber memory is bounded by tiers of magic it is storing. Grand Absorber time limit: After your Grand Absorber has eaten a new item, there is only a limited number of time (you can spam a spell 24/7 for a month for example) or the spell can only be cast X number of times Grand Absorber is intelligent and greedy: Grand Absorber isn't too fond of freely handing you a crap ton of magic that it has absorbed. You're going to need to pay a price (this could be anything from your memories/gold/lives of loved ones) as tribute if you wish to use the magic Grand Absorber is TYPE limited: Your Grand Absorber can only take in spells of certain schools at a time. For instance your Grand Absorber can only eat magical items that are part of the evocation school. If a user wants to store a new type of magic (like swapping to abjuration/transmutation), the user has to drop all the spells the Grand Absorber uses. 

if time and civilian casualties are non-issues, then siege is definitely the way to go. just start by using drone aircraft to kill anyone that leaves the city. then use drones to fire-bomb any gardens visible from the air. the city will starve to death within weeks, perhaps months if they are seriously over-provisioned. bombing the water and power infrastructure will accelerate the situation substantially. 

note: some of the jobs listed above are currently not low-skill positions (e.g. teacher). however, after the automation revolution they will be able to afford to hire a lot of low-skilled assistants (e.g. 1 assistant per child in a private school). similarly, low-skilled versions of the positions might become economically viable (e.g. low-skilled after-school tutors). everyone with a high-skill job will hire a team of low-skilled personal assistants. with automation driving the productivity of high-skilled jobs up, even the middle class will be able to afford a team of low-skilled assistants who understand their own personal taste. for example: 

1066~1440 CE before the normans conquered england in 1066-1072ce, the residents of england spoke a language called "old english", which is arguably more similar to modern german than modern english (e.g. Beowulf 700~1050ce). so, before 1066 you would have almost no chance of understanding anyone without significant study. after the normans conquered england, the conqueror's "old french" mixed with the commoner's "old english" to form a new simpler language we today call "english". that said, it took a few generations for the languages to mix, so in 1073 you would be just about as lost as 1065, but by 1300's things would start sounding familiar (e.g. the canterbury tales from 1386). still, without modern printing, dialects varied widely between towns, classes and generations. in fact, a typical uneducated serf would have a gruff german vocabulary you would consider rudimentary, while an "old money" noble conversation would sound closer to french and might actually include a few french or latin words. it wasn't until the printing press was invented in 1440 that the english language started to unify and stabilize into what we would recognize as "modern english" (e.g. asop's fables from 1484, typeface notwithstanding). so, listening to an educated person speak in 1450 london would be almost perfectly intelligible. you might need a few days to get used to their accent, word choice and world view, but the vocabulary and grammar would be perfectly serviceable to discuss most topics. futher reading: $URL$ side notes: you must keep in mind that the culture of pre-modern england was very different from today. on the one hand, without mass transportation, most people lived their entire lives within 40km of their home. with no dictionaries, they expected to have difficulty communicating with anyone who lived more than one village away. as such, they would probably be more adept at bridging the dialect gap than you. in a big city like london, you could probably find someone you could understand quickly. on the other hand, rural strangercide was much more common, and they might just kill you rather than try to figure out why you left your previous home (presumably not by choice...). at the very least, once the local lord determined you did not belong to any other lord, he would probably try to force you to work his land rather than accept the preposterous premise that your knowledge could be more valuable than your muscles. even today, you can see the upper/lower class french/german split in distinctions like a restaurant's "beef" (french bœuf) vs a farmer's "cow" (german kuh). or lower class german expressions like "blow up" vs upper class terminology such as "explode". 

There is a research paper about this subject although if you want more than the abstract, you'll have to pay for it. Although I am not a doctor, from my understanding, you Link to Article 

As your speedster is activating powers 0(human)-100%(86400x), just slow down time by that much. You don't need to slam your fingers as hard as you possibly can while typing. I don't see any reason why this power would be treated any differently than using a muscle. Now that is not to say that using the speed muscle exerts effort (my heart is pumping blood and that costs me no effort). With that being said, some psychological effects of such a power would be... 

If you are willing to handwaive away the issue of storing the chemicals and making sure it stays cold, you could freeze areas of skin via the use of liquid nitrogen. I'm envisioning one of the following. 

You want to sling spells like Glarnak and the rest of em cowboy? Well this lifestyle... it really ages you... You definitely want to drain the life force of the caster on this one. If you do heat or luck, you can run into the problem of always prolonging the cost ad infinitum(cold + luck spells). The cost to perform magic should be based on the strength of the life force of a caster. The more magic used, the more the caster is aged. Incredibly strong magic users would age slower per spell cast. You could even have it so that a spellcaster could burn through all his/her life force to increase the power of another spellcaster . Like a form of magic inheritance from parent to child. How the choice would reflect resistance as more energy or power is drawn for a spell. Energy required (whether kinetic, heat, whatever) * spell caster level (golf rules apply here the lower the value the better you are at casting ) = seconds/minutes/years/decades of your VERY LIFE. How the choice would create a measurable or predictable consequence turning people against magic. Obviously you don't want to turn to dust and turbo age yourself via spamming fireballs every 5 seconds. This system should make magic cost you and stop you from needlessly casting spells. You aren't going to use magic to pull weeds when you can literally SAVE yourself the time by not casting. How the choice would be deterministic, meaning the aforementioned consequence could be traced back to a specific action. Your magic can't rob UNWILLING life. when your magic caster is casting a spell, he/she needs to draw from there own years OR have someone use magic to transfer lifetime/magic capability. Also you can't dip into years you don't have access to. In the same way your muscles give out, if you start to lift a building of osmium, there will come a point where you age away and drop the building. 

extensive education will be the key to success. 500 years ago, most people didn't think they were smart enough to learn how to read. today, basic literacy is nearly universal. even entry level jobs like ticket taker or cashier require some literacy. in the post-automation world, learning to identify and solve problems robots can't will be a basic skill that everyone learns. today most first world children receive between 12 and 23 years of education. in the post-automation world, people may receive at 20-30 years of education before they are considered "qualified" for a skilled career. in addition to subsidizing education, the government will probably implement a universal basic income. this would allow everyone to buy minimal food, clothing and shelter. in fact, a similar scheme was proposed in the united states in 1969 (killed in the senate) and recently voted on in switzerland (only 23% in favor). income disparity will increase exponentially. ever since the invention of the plow, income disparity has been getting exponentially larger because technology has allowed some people to become more productive than other people. while no one is likely to starve to death in the post-automation world, there will be people who only have the basics. in contrast, the super-rich are likely to have their own private floating island. on the plus side, those same super-rich will probably spend a lot of time making life better for the desperately poor (e.g. by eradicating malaria). or maybe it would be a utopia. if all manual labor is really done by robots, then in theory that includes building robots. in which case robots would be virtually free so surely some rich person will give one to everyone on the planet. life would be pretty easy if everyone had their own personal robot slave. with the cost of manual labor dirt cheap, anyone could grow all their own food, and build their own floating island. the only scarce resources would be raw materials and energy. and considering the abundant aluminum silicates in the earth's crust are easily made into aluminum and glass given enough energy, really only energy would be scarce. 

For more conversions (if your aliens want to speed up time in a different manner) here is a handy chart to show you Percent Speed of Light and how many days/years that would be if you spent 1 day going at that percent speed. For example 0.99999999999999 c, for every day on board the alien ship, 19380.535 years have passed on the planet.

If you watch the second video, the scientists can only shoot plasma around 2 feet. To the Marksman Dragon, range is definitely a status symbol. Your dragons might have drastically smaller ranges while young thus making the Marksman Dragon a much more parental dragon over the conventional dragon that doesn't typically need to shoot far. Or maybe the gift of "LongShot", as the Marksman Dragons call it, is a genetic trait that is sexually selected for. Video Example $URL$ More in Depth Video of some science behind $URL$ 

war between species would be nearly impossible. each species would completely dominate any battle fought in their domain. as such, wars simply wouldn't happen. there might be some skirmishes on the borders, but there is no way that one species could ever conquer another, so full-fledged war is out of the question. however, trade is quite likely. the merfolk would trade fish, the morlocks would trade metals and gems. the surface folk would trade crops and leather. as modern technology appeared, there might be the possibility of warfare since you could poison the entire sea, or cause continuous earthquakes. even then, it seems unlikely that you would gain much from committing genocide. side note: it is not clear how the morlocks would survive. nearly all life on earth depends on energy from the sun. assuming the morlocks use some sort of radioactive material for energy (therefore food), that could be another item of trade (or combat). 

pixelation basically, any simulation has a max resolution. at some point, you stop drawing discrete pixels, and just calculate the average effect of everything below that resolution as a continuous field of forces and probabilities. for example, if you wanted to simulate the solar system without calculating the position and velocity of every electron, then you would simply use an equation to compute the average position and velocity the planets and other large bodies. the pixelation limit of that simulation would be at the planet level and you couldn't break apart a planet to look at how it's internal components interact. if you want to "zoom in" on part of the earth and see animals running around, you need to increase your computing power substantially. the pixel limit of our universe appears to be sub-atomic particles (e.g. electrons), indicating that we live in a simulation that pixelates at around the size of an electron. you simply can not assign a location and velocity to an electron in any meaningful way because it is smaller than a "pixel" in the simulator that runs our universe.
