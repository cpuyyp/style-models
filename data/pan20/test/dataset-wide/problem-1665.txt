In 2010 the Wellcome Trust published One mutation per 15 cigarettes: genome maps reveal how cancer develops 

Safety Devices Elevators do have many safety devices, however maintenance workers will sometimes disable them to facilitate their work. Suzanne Hart's Midtown Elevator Death Due To Disabled Safety Device - Huff Post, New York, October 30, 2012 Elevator Work Blamed in Death of Suzanne Hart - New York Times January 23, 2012 It seems possible that, in recent decades, being crushed or decapitated in an elevator doorway by unexpected elevator motion is more likely than dying in a falling elevator car. 

In general, no. We cannot easily or safely manipulate our cellular pH outside normal ranges. Our cells have mechanisms to regulate pH. If pH goes outside the normal ranges we become ill and may die. [5] 

The brain is part of the CNS so it is nonsensical to write of creating a bond between them. The pineal gland's activity is primarily affected by light not by sound. 

Brown rats (R. norvegicus) raised in captivity can reach 800g but it seems unlikely that large numbers of wild rats do so. 

As for "not have time to bathe thoroughly" - probably nobody bathed in a way that would be considered thorough today. Not for lack of time but simply because it wasn't thought necessary. 

Speculation: A soldier defending his homeland against foreign invaders might take a different view if the invaders are using flamethrowers and white phosphorus grenades against him or her. Perhaps, literally in the fog of war, the unpleasant and potentially harmful smoke from white phosphorus grenades was described by Japanese soldiers as "poison gas". 

There is no suggestion from the original photographers that spiders place water droplets on their heads. Web pages that re-post these photos don't have any references to support the notion. There are at least two photographers who stage these photographs. 

Shelby F. Thames, professor of polymer science and president of the University of Southern Mississippi is reported as saying 

If "This is happening all over the country" in the USA since 2008, we ought to reasonably expect it to be well-reported in mainstream media and medical reports/studies by now. 

A Gallup poll in 1999 found that 18% of Americans thought the Sun revolves around the earth. So there is support for the notion that substantial numbers of people in the US hold this belief. 

Apparently the latter doesn't give a specific reference but the bibliography mentions Gandhi's autobiography - however the blogger can find no trace of the story in Gandhi's autobiography. 

Traditional Technique and it's purpose The best description of the traditional technique I have found so far is from a rather lightweight and unreliable source: 

Miscellaneous references 1 2 3 4 5 Footnotes †(Frankly I find his writings and reported interviews somewhat confusing, but I'll try to provide references for this paragraph in a later edit) 

Honestly, more research is needed. Some research has already been done in the past 10 years, but not enough to really make solid conclusions. For example, there's no research to support the "10% of body weight + 1 pound" rule that you'll find all over the internet (example). With kids, there's also some concern about the safety of weighted devices. The Live Science article Weighted Blankets: Harmless for Adults, Potentially Dangerous for Kids mentions two deaths that were linked to weighted blankets. (Oxford Health NHS has some guidance for use here.) The Live Science article does a good job at citing (and linking to) studies that have been done. The first one "showed only that weighted blankets were safe for people to use, not whether they are effective in improving people's health": 

It's also relevant to note that the removed Facebook page is probably this page: $URL$ which is also linked to by your article. Although it's deleted, you can read the full post here. (We can confirm that's what the page said by quickly performing Google searches before Google updates its results, and seeing that page pop up as a result, like this.) Lastly, I'll also note that the KATC article reports: 

Before rain hits the ground, it goes through the air and can pick up particles that you don't want to be drinking. How much of an issue this is will depend on where you are. Rain water in urban cities can be pretty bad: 

(Here is the original French version.) There is no evidence that it was a response to the poetry quote. In fact, the evidence points to nearly the opposite being the case: 

Obviously, this wasn't around in 1968, when the interview was given. I'm not sure where the 2038/2039 date comes from exactly, but Wikipedia says this: 

The paper Does 'Sorry' Incriminate? Evidence, Harm and the Protection of Apology explains about the laws: 

Summary: The main point of these claims is that the death rate for some diseases was declining before vaccines. While that is true, it misses the fact that even though the death rate was declining, plenty of people (mostly children) were still getting and suffering from these diseases. Vaccines dramatically decreased both the number of total cases and the number of total deaths. 

There are two permits here that are grouped together, The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act permit and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act permit (presumably because they are very similar permits). While I can't find much information on the Migratory Birds permit, I found what can be playfully described as a choose-your-adventure guide for determining if you actually need an Eagle permit. It's on the US Fish and Wildlife (FWS) site here. One path ends with you needing to sign something, but not needing an Eagle permit. FWS has a list of permits here, but not all the permits are in their list, and most of the permits that are listed don't have an "Estimated Processing Time". 

I have not yet found any reliable primary sources for these stories. The reports are brief and certainly contain no data concerning efficiency. 

No. The linked article is entitled "How A Computer Algorithm Predicted West Africa’s Ebola Outbreak Before It Was Announced" and goes on to discuss Healthmap. The claim appears to be that Healthmap computer algorithms predicted an Ebola outbreak 9 days before the WHO announced it. However Healthmap made no prediction saying something like "there will be an Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 9 days time" Healthmap issues alerts about recent historical events, it does not issue predictions about future events. So the claim that Healthmap computer algorithms made a prediction is false. The article in question appears to be an entry on a personal blog written by "a doctoral student working on my PhD in Social and Behavioral Health" The body of the article doesn't attempt to support its headline. The claim in the headline may not be a serious or notable claim. The body of the article supports a claim that Healthmap announced possible cases of Ebola in West Africa before the WHO did. The article claims that Healthmap did this because Healthmap picks up on mentions of diseases in the personal blogs of healthworkers rather than only relying on official formal reports via national health agencies. 

1. Did or do (Sami) reindeer herders castrate reindeer by biting off the testicles? No they don't and (probably) never did. They used to half-castrate reindeer by crushing their testicles without breaking the skin. Any claim in a video that testicles are being bitten off (removed) in traditional Sami practice is likely to be either an ignorant interpretation of what is shown or a sensationalist attempt to exploit the squeamishness of potential viewers. 

How common are meteors? The Chelyabinsk meteor was the largest for 104 years, but meteors in general are commonplace. The International Meteor Organisation says 

According to the paper cited, "High-power ELF radiation generated by modulated HF heating of the ionosphere can cause Earthquakes, Cyclones and localized heating", HAARP's power is 3.6 x 10^9 W According to HAARP the actual power is 1000 times smaller than this - 3.6 x 10^6 W. The Sun radiates 174 x 10^15 W onto the planet. Of this 35 x 10^15 W is absorbed by the atmosphere. Ref So the Sun's radiation absorbed in the atmosphere is 10^9 times larger than HAARP, of course it is also over a much larger volume, so this needs to be taken into account ... According to HAARP 

The reporter was Stuart Auerbach. Conclusion (re image 2) This photograph of Brzezinsky and an unidentified Pakistani army major does not represent the forging of a strong alliance between Brzezinski and bin-Laden or between the USA and Saudi-Arabian led groups opposing the Soviet invasion. 

Market Share - A select group of companies are shown across various markets, but the complete market is not shown. For example Google is shown to apparently represent search engines, but absent is Microsoft (Bing), Yahoo, or any other competitors. Google Search Engine Market Share is approximately 71%. This seems to be the sector that most supports the question, if we look at cable news, of course, it is the opposite, with about 48% of the market being represented by Companies with officers that are Jewish or of Jewish descent. These two are the easiest to estimate from the chart, since it is incomplete and the market breakdown is not really specified. Assuming Jews or Individuals with Jewish Heritage/Culture were officers in News and Entertainment companies, does that mean they control the American media? The answer is also no. Similar in part 1, the question derives from a misunderstanding of freedom and capitalism. Under this system, neither the producer or the consumer completely controls the market, if the producer tries to produce something that does not meet the demands of the consumers, they are quickly replaced by one that does. Perhaps one could argue that Radio or Cable television are hardly free markets due to FCC regulations, but this list also contains movie, internet, newspaper and magazine companies, which hold no such regulations. Holding a position of power in a company does not allow you to change the market demands, just to influence business decisions in the company. These decisions may have an impact on market share, but as long as the market is free, that impact on market share is the result of meeting or not meeting the customers demands. A famous example of this is the Decline of Schlitz beer from a market leader in the 50s and 60s to a cautionary tale in the late 70s as a result of cutting quality to increase profitability. This Excerpt from page 89 of The U.S. Brewing Industry Data exemplifies how efficiently the market can react to changes in a product 

*This argument does not require belief in the existence of Free Agency (I do, but apparently discussions of free agency are outside the scope of the skeptics SE). Consider this. Even if some external force is controlling Natan Sharansky thoughts (as suggested by Christian, Daniel Dannett, and perhaps many others), the fact that he believes he is in control of his thoughts allows him considerable freedom from the attempts of the Soviets at controlling his thoughts by wielding their physical power and controlling the consequences of his choices to the extent they are able. This is evidenced by the provided reference. I don't think that I will ever be able to prove the existence of free agency to someone that does not believe it, and is unwilling to experiment with it, but there are plenty of cases, such as this one, that demonstrate that at a minimum a belief in free agency and exercise of such agency can protect oneself from external attempts at control.
