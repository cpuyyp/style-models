From mindfulness, clear comprehension arise, from clear comprehension, insight arise, from insight, wisdom arise. Without wisdom one would not know skilful from unskilful action, appropriate from inappropriate body, speech and mind cultivation. How then can one purify oneself? 

Ajahn Sujato stop short of connecting the "radiant mind" with Nibbana because ..it can be defiled. The answer is provided by Ajahn Mun’s description: 

A bhavanga citta is a vipaka citta (kamma-result), but called bhavanga (literally meaning “factor of life”) because it performs the function of the “life continuum”. Now we come to the question how is it stored? Dynamically maintained throughout one life to another is just a postulation with no-doctrinal evidence: 

Efflunent are "outflows". How is it outflows? The mind which is the originator of "things", thougts, "goes-out" and make things out that is seen, or heard..etc. When we stay with just the seeing and hearing, there is only visual object as yet unidentified, sound as yet unrecognised, and it can stay that way. When it does stay that way the mind cannot make anything out of it so remains uninvolved with it. But when it identifies it then it starts fondling it, and the chain/links of dependent origination runs. When the mind stays with just the perceiving, i.e seeing, hearing, etc.. without "making it out" it is said to be in a state of awareness called Atammayata. This pali word is attributed to have been discovered by Buddhadasa 

Shaolin Buddhism "Action Meditation" Basically Shaolin martial arts come from the idea of “action meditation” of Chan (dhyana – Sanskrit, Jhana – pali) Buddhism (Mahayana). The first Shaolin temple was started by an Indian Theravada monk called Buddhabhadra and the next Abbot of the temple was the famous Indian Mahayana monk called Bodhidharma who brought Chan Buddhism to China. Batuo and the Shaolin Temple 

In many cases Mara the Evil One appears when he realises that someone somewhere is about to escape from his grips, when they are practising ardently, about to attain enlightenment, and his purpose is to arouse fear, trepidation, and so on to disrupt their practice.Kassaka Sutta,Brahma-nimananika Sutta,Soma Sutta,Sister Vajira Sutta etc.. IMHO Mara is searching to see if Vakkali has actully escape from him. If Mara has to search, that means that that consciousness has already gone beyond his domain. 

Stay with loving kindness (Metta) and act out of goodwill. Have compassion (karuna) knowing that all people suffer and offer help when you have strength. Avoid perceptions of gender and personalities as that would lead to conditioned responses or worst still stereotyped reactions. So with mindfulness intact act with goodwill. 

I suppose before we gain enlightenment equipoise or equanimity would be the appropriate response, then again use Upaya-kaushalya (skilful means), if you have the wisdom 

Different Buddhist traditions have some mention of an original, primordial mind of some sort. If there is one, what are its attributes. 

The Mahāsāṃghika coupled this idea of the luminous mind with the idea of the mulavijnana (*Eight consciousnesses), the substratum consciousness that serves as the basis consciousness. Pure consciousness 

Both Ajahn Mun and the Buddha are saying the same thing but Ajahn Mun had clarified that the luminous mind has lost it radiance when it is obscured by defilements and that we have to get rid of the defilements to reach the state of the primal mind (why would we want to go back to the primal mind, only if it is inherently luminous). The Buddha stated very clearly that whether the mind is defiled or not it is still an inherently luminous mind. (inherently - my addition in light of Ajahn Mun's clarification) Is an inherently luminous mind therefore the same as "consciousness without feature" i.e. Nibbana? What Ajahn Mun's has said is that the primeval mind is defiled in the way of being obscured by defilements and not as altered ". What is intrinsically bright cannot be defiled by alteration but can be obscured, ...like the clouds covering the sun. The inherent luminous mind obscured by defilements is therefore bhavanga. 1) So is the true characteristics of Bhavanga, Pabhassara and Nibbana, the same, "consciousness without feature", except that Bhavanga has defilements obscuring its true nature? 2) Or is Bhavanga and Pabhassara the same, both luminous primodial mind, and different from Nibbana? 3) Or is Pabhassara, a luminous primodial mind with Avijja, not the same as Nibbana, pure awakened mind with vijja and Bhavanga just "emanations" of Pabhassara? The Thai forest tradition of Ajahn Mun seems to adopts the third view. 

Deathbed Sutra of the Buddha From the customers' reviews of the book, I get the impression that it is a fictional work to provoke a reassessment of one's thinking in light of controversies. A few reviews from customers: 

Kamma ( usually meant as result,vipaka) is the result of an action. Whereas effluent is a tendency (kilesa, unskilfulness) of an untrained mind. 

But the true nature of apo cannot be sensed through the body. It can only be sensed through mind sense door. Vayo is the nature that pushes or pulls materials together. 

There are many variations and from that comes the simple belief that if a filial son could descend to Avici Hell and save his mother, a filial son will will always saves his mother especially if he is a monk. In Confucianism filial duty is inculcated and taken for granted 

First of all is the "rainbow body" almost similar in the different lineages of Tibetan Buddhism? Then the above question. Thanks 

In the Theravada pali cannon: In this Devadaha Sutta , the Buddha refutes the theories of the Jains — here called the Niganthas — and heaps ridicule on the idea of trying to burn kamma by asceticism. First he notes that none of the Niganthas have ever come to the end of pain by trying to burn it away in this way; 

It seems that you feel that you've been dealt with a raw deal in this life. Accept who you are, what you've got and remind yourself the countless blessing you've got in this life and shun those negative thoughts. Start with the first blessing which is you are born human.. 

The Upajjhatthana Sutta five remembrances is used in the evening chanting by many Theravadin temples and monasteries. Five remembrances 

We do not have a choice when we are faced with this condition, as we are conditioned being! How ever we act (i.e lie, or not lie) if we have not attained the state of an ariya (one of the 4 noble ones) our views are based on (avijja)ignorance or not knowing, because it is base on self ( us and others). Whatever views or actions that results from avijja are simply actions that are based on intentions. Whereas the views and actions from the noble ones mainly come from wisdom and not intentions (ref somewhere in the Abhidhamma) as they are free from the delusion of self and others. As kamma is based on our intention then our true intention to lie or not to lie is paramount! And how does wisdom come about? From mindfulness (sati), clear-comprehension (sampajanna) arise, from clear-comprehension wisdom (panna) arise. 

One of the reasons for not "understanding" others is our own unwillingness to accept that others can act out of malice, selfishness and basically unskillfully. Their actions are conditioned by their upbringing, their values, friends, families, books they read, goals they want etc.. Can we really understand their conditionings when they are that numerous? We accept that they behave badly because of their conditioning. If you and I had their conditioning we would behave exactly the way they do, because we are conditioned. People behave because they are conditioned both good and bad. How hard is it to change our own conditioning and how much more difficult others conditioning. If we want (craves) to change others, and that craving is not satisfied, suffering arises (2nd noble truth). One can earnestly try and then accept the results as there are and no suffering arises and then try again, and again.. 

From the above it appears that the Theravada Commentators have resisted the temptation to create mechanism for the "transmission" of kamma, in contrast to other traditions. Briefly, in the tradition of the Yogacara Buddhist they have a concept of store –consciousness (alaya-vijnana). We shall now leave the subject of bhavanga, and how kamma is stored in the consciousness and turn elsewhere for help. Unable to find any doctrinal support, we shall now turn to the people most qualified to speak on the subject, the meditators, who many believed to have experience the ultimate and have spoken on it and I refer to Ajahn Mun of the Thai forest tradition and he spoke of the luminous mind(pabhassara-citta) I quote from the above link: 

I cannot avoid ageing. I am subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging. Jarādhammomhi jaraṃ anatīto.... I cannot avoid illness. I am subject to illness, have not gone beyond illness. Vyādhidhammomhi vyādhiṃ anatīto.... I cannot avoid death. I am subject to death, have not gone beyond death. Maraṇadhammomhi maraṇaṃ anatīto.... I will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me. Sabbehi me piyehi manāpehi nānābhāvo vinābhāvo.... I am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir.[3] Kammassakomhi kammadāyādo kammayoni kammabandhū kammapaṭisaraṇo yaṃ kammaṃ karissāmi kalyāṇaṃ vā pāpakaṃ vā tassa dāyādo bhavissāmī....[4]
