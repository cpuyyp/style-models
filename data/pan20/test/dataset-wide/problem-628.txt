Pacelines can be a lot of fun. They work best when the more experienced riders in the group take some time out to explain how things work to newer riders. And it helps to fall in with riders at your level. I like riding with the fast guys but once my legs start screaming I drop off the back and find a slower group. 

Most hard-soled cycling shoes position your heel slightly above the ball of your foot (so a slight toes-down angle). That's probably the angle I maintain throughout each pedal stroke, but to be honest I don't think about it much, nor do I know what's "correct". I focus on trying to make smooth circles and let my ankles do what comes naturally. Focusing on pointing my toes down seems to help on tough spinning climbs, but it's probably just a psychological trick. 

Do what Amos suggested to find out if there are any patterns in the flats. The worst I've had was a tiny piece of radial wire (from blown out car/truck tires) stuck in the thickest part of the tread. It was very difficult to find and only pressed into the tube while riding. Worst case, if you can't find the source but know the rim & tape are ok, just replace the tire. I carry a spare folding tire on really long rides for that reason. 

For any given speed, you can either spin at a higher cadence in a lower gear, or a lower cadence in a higher gear. The high cadence + low gear combination should reduce the strain on your joints since you don't have to push as hard. You just have to do it more often. I like to ride around 90rpm and sometimes drift up to 100-110 especially if I'm trying to catch up to or overtake someone. I'll drop down to 80 for long, steep climbs (seated -- no idea what my cadence is standing). Lance Armstrong apparently maintains 110rpm for efficiency. It took me a while to get used to 90 so I'd suggest building up to it slowly. Let us know when you can do 110 comfortably! 

I bicycle about exactly the same amount per week, and I bike both on road and in parks. Bikes are essential for me getting to work and other places, so I decided for a bulletproof solution (which may not suit you, or most other people): I commute on a singlespeed bike. I use drum brakes on the rear wheel, which are completely insulated from atmospheric conditions and dust, and I never have to adjust brake pads. There is almost nothing that can go wrong on these bikes. All the maintenance I do is the occasional oiling of the chain, and topping up the pressure in the tires. Paired with puncture resistant tires, I have the confidence that I will be able to ride my bike to work and back home, every day. As I mentioned, this is not a solution everyone will like, but you might consider it as an option. 

I think Nathan Knutson covered the topic quite well, but I would like to round it out with one exception: the disc rotor bolts need blue Loctite threadlocker, because those usually thread into an aluminium hub, and yet they should stay immobile for the lifetime of the rotor. And they should stay fixed in place without relying on high torque, unlike most other fasteners on a bike. To compensate for this relatively low torque, you need a threadlocker. 

As you have mentioned yourself, the M70T3 uses a threaded post, while the M65T3 uses a knurled post that requires a screw on the V-brake or, more commonly, on a cantilever brake. In fact, the M65T3 is sold as a cantilever brake, and it is shorter and chubbier than the M70T3. If you have a V brake, you shold buy the M70T3. 

So if you're trying to keep the costs and headaches down, look for bar end shifters and brake levers designed for MTB brakes. Is it worth it? If you really want drop bars, enjoy working on your bike and it costs less than buying a new one, then yes. But make sure you plan & price it out. 

AA cell phone charger (which you're already using) -- uses 2 or 4 AA's to recharge your gadgets. I use an Energizer model to charge my GPS for rides over 12 hours. Of course you need to carry enough batteries for the length of your ride. Solar charger -- can be mounted on a handlebar bag, a rear rack or hanging from your pack and typically has mini-USB connections for cell phones etc. No batteries required but won't help much on a rainy day. I've seen a variety of these at local outdoors shops. Dynamo hub charger -- this is probably the most expensive option, especially if you don't already have a dynamo hub. I'd like one of these (already have the hub) but the AA charger has been fine so far. 

I would carry at least one unpatched, pristine tube as a spare. Put the patched ones on the bike or keep for repairs at home. The idea being that when you need it -- in the middle of nowhere, in the dark and pouring rain -- you're guaranteed that the old patches aren't peeling off or weakened and the tube should "just work". Then swap it for a patched tube when you get home if you like.
