Looking at the numbers and comparing to JPL Horizons, the best match is to the position of the Earth-Moon Barycenter in heliocentric coordinates. That's of course consistent with the data being labeled as: . If you can live with some small uncertainties due to the details of how coordinate transforms may evolve over time, I believe you can just apply some simple trigonometry. You can confirm here. $$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$ $$l = tan^{-1}(y/x)$$ $$b = sin^{-1}(z/r)$$ 

The final configuration of the MeerKAT radio array will be 64 dishes. In the press release of July 16, 2016 a radio image is shown using a completed sub-set of 16 dishes. Which 16 are these? I can find documents on-line with coordinates for 64 location, (sometimes numbered 1 through 64, but not here), but I can't figure out which 16 are used to produce this image. I found images of KAT-7 and MeerKAT in google maps - maybe someday we can get daily ground truth updates from Planet Labs, but for right now I'll stick to stackexchange. Image from the press release: 

below: Figure 2 (partial) showing the timeline seconds before and hours and days after (logarithmic scale). The GW and GRB data were used (see Figure 1) to start the search for the rest of the electromagnetic search. 

Is this the earliest that such a phenomenon has been "seen" by a person, or does this observation also hold the record after including all of the automated searches for supernovae by robotic telescopes as well? 

Asteroids are discovered constantly, and sometimes this happens in images that were not intended to be searches for asteroids, as in this case. While most most asteroids orbit close to the plane of the ecliptic, some of their orbits do stray substantially above and below it, as in this case. While the date of the News Release is 02-Nov-2017, I don't know the time frame of all of the exposures that contributed to this final composite image. Here is a screen shot of the Planetarium Mode of Dominic Ford's in-the-sky.org. The marker shows the position of Abell 370 just below the equator, and the Ecliptic is the thicker line above it. 

the last two of which identify the location as Abell 370, at about RA: 2h 40m, Dec: -1.6°. At about RA = 0h the ecliptic and equator coincide, but by 2h 40m the ecliptic has a declination of about +16°, so this photo is looking about 18° below the ecliptic. The first paragraph of the caption contained in both of those links says: 

The V838 Monocerotis expansion (not a supernova) and the observation of the subsequent "spectacular" light echo was quite a notable event! From Nature 422, 405-408 (27 March 2003) 

Question: How do the phased array feeds on each dish of the ASKAP interact with the entire array phasing? I'm not sure of the "focal plane array" is located precisely at the focal plane or not. If it were, then a given source in the sky would produce signals in only one, or a small group of receivers, and not the whole focal plane array! One normally uses a phased array instead of an imaging system so there must be something more interesting going on here, perhaps only nearest and next-nearest neighbor correlations within the focal plane array but full correlation between the dishes? How does this thing really work? 

Here's a rough check on that, offered as a supplementary answer. Using the Python package Skyfield one can calculate the distance to the center of the Moon. Right now I don't know how to calculate the distance to the specific location of the Apollo 15 reflectors on the Moon, but the distance from the observatory to the closest point on the Moon is about 200 km shorter than the distance determined from laser pulses as described in the other answer. This seems about right considering the radius of the Moon is about 1767 km. Output: 

I think its a good question and has probably popped up in the back of many people's minds for milliseconds, both astronomers and lay people, though most of them would still be hesitant to admit it on an internet forum. And of course, our understanding of what is possible or even "normal" in the universe is vanishingly small. edit 2: 

tl;dr: The synodic period would be the same. For this object it will be about: $$\left( \frac{1}{365.25} - \frac{1}{557} \right)^{-1} \approx 1061 \ days.$$ You can confirm that by reading this new ArXiv preprint about Roadster: The random walk of cars and their collision probabilities with planets. In the 2nd paragraph of Section 3 it says: 

The article links to The Detection of an Extremely Bright Fast Radio Burst in a Phased Array Feed Survey which is not paywalled and contains some discussion of the array. This sounds really interesting! It is a phased array of dishes, but at the focal plane of each dish there is also a phased array of receivers. This is different than just adding an array of feed horns and independent receivers as I've discussed in my surprisingly robustly unanswered question What is the highest granularity focal-plane array on a dish radio telescope? Or is this the ONLY ONE? where receivers measure intensity as pixels, in a similar way to a camera (thus the counterintuitively placed tag there). Here, each focal plane is equipped with a true phased array, where if I understand correctly, phase relationships between elements in the focal plane are maintained and recorded. According to Wikipedia and CSIRO's Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder – Fast Facts there are 36 separate 12-meter dishes in the entire array, and the focal plane of each dish is equipped with a 188 element focal-plane phased-array. 188 $\times$ 36 = 6768 channels, not counting polarizations because I don't know if they are separate channels in this case. That would require quite a hefty correlater if the analysis was done flat, without any heierarchy in the calculation. This is a pathfinder for the SKA so pushing limits is important, but I'd like to know how this large number of signals is handled. Is there pre-processing? 

But to answer your question, the period is about 557 days. You can see this for example if you go to JPL's Horizons and look at the osculating elements. If you look a few weeks in the future when the Roadster is sufficiently far away from Earth not to be perturbed, the period around the Sun flattens out to 557 days. 

After reading this answer I wondered if there have been document comets with orbits on non-return, hyperbolic trajectories as they approached the Sun. This means that they would not be gravitationally bound to the sun, so either they came from outside the solar system, or they managed to gain energy through a collision, or close pass with a large planet like Jupiter. The quickest way to find the comet with the "highest" orbit is to ask for the one with the largest specific orbital energy, the total energy (kinetic + potential) divided by the mass, (Joules/kg). For a bound orbit the value would be negative, for an unbound, non-returning orbit it would be positive. Question: What documented comet has/had the highest specific orbital energy? It should be an identified object with a known or measured orbit, not just a generic, nameless "edge-of-the-Oort Cloud placeholder." 

The new paper Probing Planets in Extragalactic Galaxies Using Quasar Microlensing (also in ArXiv) is too mind-boggling for me to understand exactly what is happening. I have some very basic understanding of gravitational microlensing from other Q&A here (and Wikipedia) but I can't figure out what is happening in this paper. There are thousands of planets seen in another galaxy, which do not orbit stars? There is discussion of "emission close to the event horizon of the supermassive black hole of the background quasar"... there are too many unusual things going on at once for me to fathom. Is it possible for someone to sort out the basics of what's happening? The Quasar is in front, and the galaxy containing these planets is behind? What emission? 

update: The BBC News article Citizen science bags five-planet haul announces the system K2-138, also described as a "resonant chain" of planets. However, see the actual paper in ArXiv and Ast. J. where the title calls it only a "near-resonant chain" instead; The K2-138 System: A Near-Resonant Chain of Five Sub-Neptune Planets Discovered by Citizen Scientists The Phys.org news item Discovery of new planet reveals distant solar system to rival our own outlines the recent announcement of results using AI to help search Kepler photometric (transit-method) data for exoplanets. Near the end is the paragraph:

I've heard of a radiant of a meteor shower - it's an apparent position of the source of meteors referenced to the position of the Earth at the time of the shower. But I've= never heard the term applied to the orbit of a minor body unrelated to the Earth's position. What is the "radiant" of a minor body with a hyperbolic orbit in a simulation? Could it be the asymptotic incoming direction of the hyperbola? But my main question is simply how "statistically significant" is this result in reference to the enhancement in the direction of Gemini? I can't see the data. Is it just a tiny fluctuation, or a fairly obvious and robust feature? A screen shot of the data would be most welcomed! Possibly helpful: List of hyperbolic comets.

From the NPR news item Astronomers Want To Know: Does This Interstellar Visitor Have A Message For Us?: 

I don't really understand this image. It is a GIF assembled from several exposures, but in each frame, individual stars appear as tight clusters of dots for some reason, and the comet moves within a bright, narrow band that crosses the entire image in all frames. Why does this looks so strange? Also, what is the importance of Kepler deviating from it's observations to concentrate on 67P during this period? What is the scientific importance of this series of observations? 

Figure 2 of the Nature paper describes the preservation of the actual light curve (history) within the structure of the light-echo shell: 

I noticed at the top of the page there is a link to the The Arecibo asteroid radar schedule, and in the fifth line of the list shown in the screen shot below, I see that for 2012 TC4 there will be what is labeled there as a "WORLDWIDE CAMPAIGN!" of observations. The all-caps and exclamation point are a direct quote from Arecibo's table. Question: What is the extent of the worldwide campaign to observe 2012 TC4? How many facilities? Is it coordinated? Perhaps simultaneous reception of reflected signals by multiple sites? Will it be coordinated with other observations such as infrared or optical wavelengths? The plot below the Arecibo table is made from JPL Horizons data in the Earth-Moon barycenter frame. It shows +/- 24 hours from closest approach. The hyperbola (red) is the calculated trajectory of 2012 TC4 with dots every 2 hours and the short, (roughly) circular arc is the Moon, as descried in this question. The closest approach to Earth's center is projected to be about 51,000 km. These are preliminary calculations based on the first observation and may be refined a bit as the time of closest approach nears.
