Realtech.com has a runtime monitoring senser solution for BOD/COD Sensor. My understanding is that COD is straight-ward to measure in real-time but BOD monitoring cannot be done in real-time. The sensor listed uses a BOD equivalent monitoring technique. The governing environmental regulatory agencies for a specific waste water facility should have public statement of acceptable BOD monitoring methods. 

Your rock appears to be a ruby (red colored corundum) in a granite / granite gneiss matrix. Because the red mineral appears to elongated and not spherical in outline is why I say it is corundum instead of being garnet (almandine, grossular). 

You have a metamorphic rock which may contain: actinolite?, chlorite? and pyroxene. Thes rock shows evidence of being a a high-grade greenschist to amphibolite metamorphic rock. Type of metamorphic rock (classified by the minerals present) can indicate of the pressure and temperature conditions under which the rock was formed. 

Based on the photo, your rock is not a meteorite but a piece of lead ore containing galena. Even with a blurry image, I can see well defined cleavage planes. Galenam, lead sulfide, is the most common grey metallic mineral with showing perfect cleavage. Galena is also very dense. Ref: Galena Mindat.org. 

Typically, the river delta is considered the end of a river where it flows into either an ocean or lake. From the image shown below, the end of the river can be defined by either at the edge of the active delta plain. or the edge of the submerged delta plain Active boundary will vary due to tidal level, river level and the rate of subsidence of the of the delta plain or fan. 

Reference. With the Colorado river, scarce rainfall and over-usage leads to a greatly diminished flow at discharge into the into the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez). 

Careful and detailed geological and hydro-geological study of each rover basin would need to be performed to determine exact cause of differences in timing of max and min flow times. 

Here is fun stat laden site for global oil and gas resource and consumption. link. Note: I take these stats at face value but oil resource production and reserve numbers are not always accurate. A number of oil producers are reluctant to provide accurate stats as these numbers are considered sensitive to their economies. 

Rock composition of typical oceanic crust consists of mineral assemblages that are significantly denser than typical continental crust. Thickness of crust has really nothing to do with its density. Plate tectonics, sedimentation, and volcanic activity will play a significant the crust thickness. Ability of upper crust to float on top of the lower crust/mantle is due to isostacy. Similar to about a helium balloon in the atmosphere. 

The rock on the left appears to be a quartz pebble. The rock on the right is too bleached out by a light source to clearly see it but shape suggests it is also a quartz pebble. 

My guesses based on visual observations using my 40+ years experience mineral collecting. 1 - pyrite 2 - uvarovite? maybe psuedomalachite? (based on color) Need a better photo 3 - quartz - moss agate - maybe from montana 5 - Turquoise? maybe dyed howellite 6 - quartz - amethyst 7 - ???? maybe galena? is it heavy? 8 - marcasite / pyrite nodule 9 - feldspar - Labradorite 10 - microcline - amazonite? maybe quartize, or adventurine 11 - Carborundum - silicon carbide man made 

You have what is commonly known as iron or iron oxide concretion. These concretions or nodules are composed in part of the iron oxy-hydroxides, limonite and goethite come in a wide variety of unusual shapes. They form commonly around a piece of organic material (like wood or plant material) or around a fossil shell. Iron oxide nodules can be quite dense and are sometimes mistaken for a meteorite. (Reference). 

The difference between mudstone and shale is that mudstones break into blocky pieces whereas shales break into thin chips with roughly parallel tops and bottoms. The terms shale and claystone are sometimes used interchangeably. References: Mudstones and shales Fun rock charts on pinterest 

Near the Lake of the Woods, the island swirl or vortex is due to structures in bedrock beneath the lake. The rocks in this area are old and have been folded by tectonic action. The area has either been folded into a dome or a basin, exposing different layers of bedrock. Glacial activity afterwards has 'flattened'the area, and differential erosion within the folded area formed valleys that flooded where the rock eroded faster. Geologic history of The Lake of the Woods. 

Your rock is most likely a blue-schist metamorphic rock. From Wikipedia: Blue-schist Blueschist ( /ˈbluːʃɪst/), also called glaucophane schist, is a metavolcanic rock1 that forms by the metamorphism of basalt and rocks with similar composition at high pressures and low temperatures (200 to ~500 degrees Celsius), approximately corresponding to a depth of 15 to 30 kilometers. The blue color of the rock comes from the presence of the predominant minerals glaucophane and lawsonite. Blueschists are typically found within orogenic belts as terranes of lithology in faulted contact with greenschist or rarely eclogite facies rocks Science Digest: Blue-schist Crete has well studied blue-green schist metamorphic lithologies. 

A river's primary of source of water is precipitation, surface water run off, and shallow groundwater discharge within the drainage basin the river is located. The size of the drainage basin really determines if a river may run dry during drought conditions. Some river basins are so large that drought conditions are unlikely to persist over the entire basin at any given moment. (See image drainage showing Mississippi River drainage ~1/2 of the US). 

You have a shiva lingam stone from India. Shiva Lingams are egg-shaped stones made of cryptocrystalline quartz. They are found in one of the seven holy sites of India - the Narmada River in Onkar Mandhata. Villagers gather the stones from the river and hand polish them. Reference: crystal-cure.com 

From the photo, your stone is appears to be chalcedony, a form of quartz. This is based on texture and its translucency. It is possible your stone might be something more unusual given its location but you need to determine hardness and density: 

The rock you have looks like hematite with rutile inter-growths. I have a similar specimen from Brazil. 

Work by James Hutton, Charles Lyell and William Smith helped define "principle of uniformitarianism". This work led to definitions in the Mesozoic and Paleozoic eons in Europe and Great Britain. The Mesozoic and Paleozoic eons helped define the extinction events reflected in the fossil record. It was these correlations that led to the discovery of the extinction events and not the other way around. Radiometric dating based on the work of Clair Patterson added absolute ages to the time scale. Over time, the process of grouping together or splitting apart rock units has grown more sophisticated as better dating techniques have been introduced and more data from mapped rock outcrops have been collected analysed.

My guess is your rock might contain huebnerite. It is brown-ish red to red in color. It is a vein forming mineral and I've seen examples similar to your specimen in metamorphic rock matrix cut by quartz veins. It has a similar tabular crystal shape. 

Based on USGS (Department of the Interior – United States Geological Survey) toopgraphic maps, where on a 7.5 min Quadrangle map, the contour interval is commonly 40 feet. Larger maps 15 min to 1'-2' maps the interval is commonly 80-100 feet. All maps of the United States are commonly sourced from USGS based maps. I am certain Google or Google's map provider is using USGS base maps. Reference: $URL$ 

Back in the early 1990s, Japanese researchers imagined magma plumes near the lower mantle / outer core boundary. Here is an article discussion shallow and deep Magma sources for the kilauea, Hawaii. As this article suggests, magma can originate at depth and migrate upward and supply shallow chambers. Facts on the Yellowstone volcanic complex. 

1 in 100,000 is an estimate of frequency based on past eruptions which should not be confused with possbility or probability. It is an oversimplification to state the probability of an eruption as 0.001% chance per year. 

It is reasonable to assume that air (atmosphere) acting as as a solution could become supersaturated with water vapor. Supersaturation condition is where the air literally contains more water vapor than is needed to cause saturation. How common these conditions might be, I do not know. 

Of course 5 minutes after I post the question, I find the answer myself: Halysites (Chain Coral) fossil extinct coral from the Silurian period. 

Three characteristics are useful when trying decide if a specimen is agate, chalcedony or jasper: 1) crystal size, 2) composition, 3) diaphaneity. Agate is a microcrystalline quartz with a translucent to semitransparent diaphaneity. For lake superior agate, it is defined as fortification agate (eye-catching banding patterns). Chalcedony is the generic term for microcrystalline quartz. Agate and jasper are also forms of chalcedony. Jasper is defined as an opaque variety of chalcedony. It is sometimes impossible to determine if a large piece of chalcedony is agate or jasper because a key characteristic for agate is translucent to semitransparent diaphaneity. Another point is that a specimen can be a mixture of jasper and agate. Back to your specimen, Lake Superior agate is defined as fortification or banded agate, photos #1, and photo #4 show some faint banding so it might be Lake superior banding although to me it also might be very colorful petrified wood. Overall, I would describe your specimen as a mix of jasper and agate. References: Lake Superior agate - wikipedia, jasper vs agate - rocktumbler.com 

You have a nice stromatolite fossil. A stromatolites are layered bio-chemical accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains by biofilms (microbial mats) of microorganisms, especially cyanobacteria. stromatolite fossils can be some of the oldest fossils found on earth. Living stromatolites can still be found today. (Wikipedia). This pattern on the underside of a stromatolite fossil is very characteristic. 

Your rock looks like a a pyrite nodule. Here is a photo of a pyrite from Huron River, near Norwalk Ohio. 

Here is an excellent explanation of the math as related the stresses represented by the Moh'r circle. $URL$ 

I think your 'happy face rock' is created by holes from fossil coral, crinoid stems, petrified wood, my guess is coral. Here are a couple of unique pieces from my collection. Coral or petrified wood 

It is iron ore referred to as bog iron ore or ironstone. Bog iron is a form of impure iron deposit that develops in bogs or swamps by the chemical or biochemical oxidation of iron carried in solution. In general, bog ores consist primarily of iron oxyhydroxides, commonly goethite (FeO(OH)). 

The first stated that sedimentary rocks are laid down in a horizontal manner. The second stated that younger rock units were deposited on top of older rock units. 

It is a rock showing color bands of iron oxide. The color banding is most likely the result of moisture penetrating the rock and causing the iron to go into solution and migrate. This process produces the color bands present in the rock. This commonly seen in sandstone formations containing iron bearing minerals. Here is an article that does a nice job illustrating how water causes iron staining. Although your rock does not appear to be sandstone, the same process applies to igneous or metamorphic rocks.

Shale typically has a low permeability but shale is not technically impermeable. Natural occurring faults, fractures and joints in shale can greatly increase the permeability of the rock. This is why hydraulic fracturing (or fracking) is used to increase fluid flow (for both water, natural gas and petroleum wells) in host rock with low permeability. Fractured shale can allow a significant amount of fluid because some shale can have porosity values greater than 10%. Given the grain size of shale, this can be a significant amount of space available to hold fluids. References: 

It is quartz, variety agate. Based on size and color, it is probably not worth very much but I've not seen much agate for sale from New Zealand so it may have some value based on ots location. It is a great piece, if I found it in my backyard I would definitely keep it. 

Bluish purple stone: Best case: Charoite (Google image it) Most likely: agate Pinkish Purple: Might be sugilite Most likely purple agate looks natural Pale blue: Blue lace agate Green: Adventurine: quartz with mica Brown-translucent (2): smoky quartz (Look carefully and see if you see silver/golden hairs... if so you have rulitated smoke quartz Pale Yellow-Green: Most likely quartz... if it feels heavier than the blue lace agate it might be beryl. 

At first glance, it appears to look like obsidian glassy with whitish specks. The location where you found suggests It is probably glass from refinery/steel mill slag. Slag is commonly found along railroad tracks for a couple of reasons. First reason, the slag may have been from a load of material being hauled on the tracks. Second reason is that refinery /steel mill slag is a common fill material used along railroad tracks because of the materials low cost. It could still be a small piece of obsidian assuming you found in a region where basaltic volcanic rocks are common: two examples: - Pacific Northwest of the United States - Northern Ireland near Tardee volcanic complex. 

Your specimen is most likely goethite after pyrite, which is a common mineral psuedomorph. The specimen may still have a inner core of pyrite which would account for its weight. Goethite density varies 3.3-4.3 while pyrite has a density of ~5.0/. Psuedomorph is derived from Greek meaning false form. Here is photo of a Goethite (limonite) after pyrite from New Mexico I have in my collection. It is quite heavy and it is definitely not galena. 

Silicon is a basic component in rock forming minerals: quartz, feldspar hornblende and other silicates. Silicon is common throughout the entire earth (probably less so in the core). All of the inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth ( plus Moon) and Mars) appear to have silicon in abundance. Rocky/stony meteorites also contain abundant silicon. 

Found a article that used a simple analytical modelling to determine how high a mountain can be. Reference Based on simple physics, tallest a mountain will be on earth is ~10 km. This is based on: 

Iron oxide gives the water its color. The Mesobi Iron range is located in Minnesota. It is very large iron deposit that is still mined today. 

I do not know of fluorite being reported to occur on Long Island. If fluorite is found in NYC, the Natural History museum might have specimens. You might try contacting a mineralogy / mineral collecting club on Long Island. Someone there would probably know for certain if fluorite can be found. Fluorite can be found in several limestone formations in New York. See map

The pendant might be dyed howlite, a common fake for real turquoise. The most distinguishing tests are destructive. Hardness test: (THIS IS A DESTRUCTIVE TEST.) A steel knife blade will easily scratch howlite which has Mohs hardness value of 3.5 Turquoise has Mohs hardness of 5–6 BEWARE: Knife blade can still scratch turquoise. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Dye test: THIS IS ALSO DESTRUCTIVE TEST. If the pendant is dyed howlite, take some acetone or nail polish remover, and use a q-tip to apply it to the back of the pendant. If the q-tip picks up some blue color or exposed surface becomes dull or white, the piece is howlite. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. There is only a slight difference specific gravity between howlite (2.53 to 2.59) and turquoise (2.6 to 2.9). Light weight cheaper quality turquoise may have the same specific gravity as howlite. Best thing to do, take it to a lapidary shop or gem shop. A gem expert can tell howlite from turquoise by physically handling the piece and closely observing the color variations.
