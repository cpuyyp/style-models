I haven't found a concrete reference to "5 % of all cancers in Australia", but it seems at least plausible. According to the WHO report, 21.6 % of all alcohol-attributable deaths are caused by cancer (p. 26). In Australia, alcohol appears to be the underlying risk factor responsible for 2-4.9 % of deaths (p. 27), and not all cancers are fatal, of course. So we're at least in the same ballpark... 

In 1996, there was a publication by Greaves et al. in the Lancet titled "An air stewardess with puzzling diarrhoea" about a stewardess who presented with a 7-year history of abdominal pain and diarrhoea (up to 10 times a day). The cause they finally found was overuse of sorbitol-containing chewing gum. (Unfortunately the article can't be accessed for free) There are more case reports like this, for example in the British Medical Journal where people consuming sorbitol in amounts of about 20-30 grams a day (one chewing gum stick contains about 1.25 g, apparently) had similar problems. The authors conclude 

Ethanol resorption can occur in the mouth (which is true) Orally absorbed ethanol doesn't pass first through the liver, yielding a higher bioavailability (which is at least to be expected considering the anatomy of the local blood vessels) Drinking with a straw is supposedly slower, allowing the ethanol a longer contact time with the oral mucosa (which at best sounds plausible but hardly evident). 

No, this story is a good example of how an urban legend can spread and get reported as true. While there is the interesting coincidence that the Cedar Senai hospital in the story is similar Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, the actual story itself is fictional and reported as such by the author Ivysir: 

In a recent Art of Manliness podcast titled "Demonic Males with Dr. Richard Wrangham", Richard Wrangham makes the claim, starting about 28 minutes into the podcast that, 

An older text on the "Neurobiology of Sleep and Memory" contains a discussion about micro-sleep in the broader context of amnesia that can point to the biological explanation for the denial, 

Note that a fair degree of what I found with regards to the negative effects of competitive sports in young children was based around injury and the extent of training necessary to be competitive from a young age. I had a hard time finding papers that discussed long term negative effects that weren't due to the potential for injury or due to time invested in training for sports. A mild editorial, but based upon the papers I have read and skimmed, it's hard to say what influence parenting might have upon a child with regards to competitive sports. Given that most papers agree that children naturally want to participate in sports among themselves, they should be familiar with the concepts of competition and loss before the recommended age of 10 cited in one of the previous articles. 

Yes, for example you could consider cervical cancer a sexually transmitted disease. If you don't have sex (with others), you won't contract HPV. 

However, studies appear to contradict this. According to the book "Alkohol und Alkoholfolgekrankheiten" by Singer/Teyssen (in German, sorry), studies during wine degustations (where ethanol is brought in contact with the oral mucosa but not swallowed), there was no relevant rise in blood alcohol levels, unless contact was for more than one hour (and then only to a BAC of 0.015). They conclude that a stronger buzz after drinking ethanol through a straw has never been scientifically observed. 

Well, to some extent, but probably not when drinking the stuff. Urine contains urea, which is used pharmaceutically as a rehydrating (water-binding) and keratolytic agent, e. g. in the treatment of skin disorders that cause scaly, dry skin, or to assist in removing skin detritus. So the presumed usefulness in diseases such as ringworm, tinea, sores, dandruff etc. appears at least understandable, although it would be a purely symptomatic treatment. Some research also appears to indicate that urea possesses some antimicrobial activity and that it enhances the skin barrier function against external factors like bacteria/fungi. But this is only for external, topical application, not for drinking. Now, why camel urine, not human urine? Well, this is all guesswork, but camels are able to concentrate their urine much higher than humans (which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint if you're a desert animal), so you'd get a higher dose from camel urine than from your homemade stuff. But if you don't have a camel around and don't mind the social disadvantages of this treatment, human urine should also work to some extent. 

The answer is going to depend a bit upon how you want to define "real signature". The ink on the page was almost certainly created using an autopen such as the Model 80 by DAMILIC. The Autopen has been in use for presidential signatures since Eisenhower and the general rule of thumb is that if it's a form letter with a signature, it's almost certainly an autopen signature. 

Is this an accurate depiction of how math is being taught or is it being grossly exaggerated and is an instruction technique of more limited use like base ten blocks. 

Responding to this question is a bit complicated as it requires a degree of inferring the intent of the original author of the response to the article. Based upon this passage from the author: 

The Dracaena cinnabari (Socotra dragon tree or dragon blood tree) is well known for having a distinct red sap or resin and there are a number of other plants that also exhibit similar "Dragons's Blood". As noted in the Wikipedia article on Dragon's Blood: 

With regards to taste, MythBusters has conducted a double-blind taste test with three testers to include Anthony Dias Blue as expert and found that subjectively the filtered vodka did taste progressively better; however, 

If you count viruses, then yes, it has been done: Reconstruction of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic virus 

The argument as I know it goes somewhere along the lines of "water drops act like lenses that focus sunbeams so that they burn the plant". Several experiments have failed to reproduce this, though (link in German, sorry) - a drop of water, even a perfect half-sphere simply doesn't act as a lens. However, there are circumstances where it might happen, and that appears to be if the structure of the leaf surface is not flat but irregular or hairy. In that case, water drops might "hover" above the actual leaf surface, and sunbeams might be focused enough to cause damage. This is not to be expected with grass, though. 

Lots of related links can be found here - it appears to be more frequent than I thought, even Vitamin C supplements containing sorbitol have been found as a cause of diarrhea... 

I suggest you read the current WHO report on Alcohol and Health 2011. Look for example at page 26, Figure 12: Alcohol abuse is the main cause of liver cancer (which can develop following liver cirrhosis) in the Western World (in other places it's still Hepatitis B). Other cancers linked to alcohol consumption are esophageal cancer, mouth and oropharynx cancer, and a few others (colon cancer, breast cancer) where it appears to be a risk factor, too. Quoting from the same report (p. 20): 

Which has been giving rise to the concept of ego depletion as a willpower model as opposed to glucose depletion so at the present time it seems like the best answer is that further research is needed and the jury is still out as to what the best model will end up being. 

The paper is quite interesting but the mathematics can be quite heavy at times as well though. The key point of the paper is summarized in the conclusion, 

No, there is no evidence to support the claim that radioactive snow fell on the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76). The photo in question was released by the US Navy with the ID 110323-N-DM338-142 and the following original caption, 

The answer to this is really going to depend heavily upon what you are defining "chi" (or "qi" or "ki") as and what the context is. To take things from a slightly different angle, aikido relies heavily upon the concept of "ki" which relates to the Chinese concept of "chi" but is very overloaded in that it doesn't really have a well defined definition of what it means and if you talk to some aikido-ka they will tell you it means one thing, other's well tell you another thing, and still others will say it's bunk. However, the truth of the matter seems to be somewhere in the middle as you can watch an aikido demostration and see that they are in fact doing effective techniques regardless of the language in which it is taught. Shihan Bernie Mulligan 1 described the concept of "chi" in aikido loosely as follows (quoted from article): 

without saying anything about whether those results were accurate. But even if they were, my guess would be that changes in oxygen saturation caused by a severe bout of malaria would far outweigh any possible changes in light absorption caused by Plasmodium parasites. But I'm curious anyway. A quick PubMed search has turned up nothing, but maybe I've been using the wrong search terms - is there any evidence available that such a device/app could in fact work? The students have won the "Women's Empowerment Award" from Microsoft's Imagine Cup in 2013, which is wonderful, but the website doesn't have any additional information, either. 

in order to detect an infection with Malaria. Now this device sounds a lot like a simple oximeter, and the claims put forth in that article are rather vacuous, i. e. 

Survival of three weeks is definitely not possible. The longest time you can survive under ideal conditions without drinking (or being administered) any water is projected at 10 days. Other than that (depending on whether the depth of the coma interferes with your breathing regulation), a few days should be survivable. But I doubt you'd be in a good enough condition to outrun a zombie afterwards. Hard to find references on that, though. 

Iceland is a fairly unique country in that it does not maintain a standing army and the arming of police is limited to the Víkingasveitin (lit. The Viking Squad, also know as the Special Task Force) which was founded in 1982 and the regular police do not carry any guns. Also, it should be noted that they emphasize only using firearms as a last resort, 

Yes micro-sleep (or microsleep) is a real phenomenon that is well documented in both the mainstream and scientific literature and can be verified by EEG. There is also evidence to support that people are sometimes not aware when this happens. With regards to the phenomenon itself, the BBC said that, 

A 2013 pre-print article up titled "Quantum annealing with more than one hundred qubits" also raises a very interesting point, 

Yes, the photograph is real and comes from Adam Wrinkler's book "Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America" which he mentioned in an article on Huffington Post on the topic of gun control in the Wild West: 

Which also factor into their conclusion that there is "support to the presence of a genuine message inside the book." So it appears that more research is needed into the Voynich manuscript as there isn't definitive proof that it is an encoded document and that there is mathematical evidence to support that it is not a hoax. 

In this video, Ted Cruz is asked by the newsanchor how he feels about asking for disaster relief funds in the wake of hurricane Harvey when he opposed such a bill for hurricane Sandy. He argues that he is all for disaster relief, but that the hurricane Sandy bill became a 50 billion dollar bill, 2/3 of which were "pork spending" that had nothing to do with Sandy, which is why he opposed that bill. Is it true that the bill contained that much unrelated material? One of the YouTube comments links to an act that reads more like a 10 billion dollar increase in spending for the National Flood Insurance Program. But maybe that's not the relevant bill in this case? 

If you've seen the movie Zero Dark Thirty, you've seen how the CIA tried to ascertain the identity of Osama bin Laden by sending a doctor to the compound where bin Laden was suspected to be hiding. The doctor represented a sham vaccination program (against Hepatitis B), asking for permission to vaccinate the children in the compound, with the intention of running DNA analyses on the syringes afterwards to determine whether any of the children were bin Laden's. The effort failed because the doctor didn't get a chance to vaccinate any of the children. On a recent episode of Star Talk Radio, Lori Garrett (sp?) asserted that this caused a violent backlash against healthcare workers, including numerous assassinations of volunteer helpers to the Polio eradication campaign. An article in Scientific American seems to corroborate this. (The doctor himself appears to have been sentenced to 33 years in a Pakistani prison for his actions.) Moral issues with using healthcare workers for non-healthcare purposes aside, is that really true? Did the Taliban (or other Muslim groups) start or increase their anti-vaccination actions after this became public? I was under the impression that religious "aversion" to vaccination campaigns (together with all sorts of conspiracy theories) has been around much longer than this incident. Are there any studies on this?
