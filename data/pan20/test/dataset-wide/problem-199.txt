Nanobots A Long time ago perhaps an advanced alien civilization visiting, scouting left a considerable chunk of self replicating nanobots for scientific purposes, their goal would be to enter the bodies of animals, analyze the different brain structures, DNA, chemical interaction and catalogue them. During this considerably long time some of these nanobots developed their own form of consciousness, vaguely mimicking the animals and sentient life on the planet. Even capable of better intelligence, energy manipulation capabilities than the naturally evolved creatures. But as they don't have any need for surviving or the desire to expand they just lay dormant mimic creatures, studying them. If an human comes into contact with this nanobots, nanobots are not visible, it infects their minds, and patiently studies them without affecting their behavior, upon death the nanobots gain some of the characteristics of the humans and mimic them acting like a spirit. 

Size I believe rather than being one type of nanobots, they will be like a new artificial genre with many sub-species. The minimum requirement for a full body immersion is need for the nanobots to cross the blood brain barrier. Rather than being completely non-organic, for the best results it would partially organic with some nano particles with has distributed/swarm intelligence. It would be almost equal and less than low micrometer to 2 micrometer similar to Liposome in size, as it is few things which can pass through, Some drug research calls for less than 200nm for crossing BBB. But nanobots in the blood and even the atmosphere can be pretty big, Your naked eye can see objects of any size, if they emit or scatter enough light to trigger its detector cells. The nanobots can be huge blots right in from of you as long as they don't emit reflect or scatter light it should invisible, It would also have to light to not float and feel natural. I would put the maximum size as 30-35 microns, higher if you solve the problem of scattering light. Materials Bottom-up approaches DNA nanotechnology utilizes the specificity of Watson–Crick base pairing to construct well-defined structures out of DNA and other nucleic acids, biomimicing, bacteria with very few genes. Approaches from the field of "classical" chemical synthesis (Inorganic and organic synthesis) also aim at designing molecules with well-defined shape, carbon nano tubes, some crystals of silicon. Top-down approaches These seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly. Many technologies that descended from conventional solid-state silicon methods for fabricating microprocessors are now capable of creating features smaller than 100 nm, falling under the definition of nanotechnology, magnetoresistance-based hard drives, atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques, nanoelectromechanical systems. The nanotechnology you describe would be combination of these two and it is hard to say exactly which materials will be used due to exponential growth in all the above mentioned fields. Grey Goo For better/easier interaction you would use bigger external nanobots which connect to you using smaller nanobots in your brain. Bigger nanobots in your blood stream will act as brains, store information, while some external will act as connection to outside world and internet. In maybe distance future external nanobots "eat" external resources and convert them into simpler objects like club upon wish, gun would be a little harder as it would need gun powder and specific resources to make them might not be any similar replacement, simpler organic materials, including new limbs and organ and simple stuff would be much easier. 

Neutrons stars are extreme objects that measure between 10 and 20 km across. They have densities of 10^17 kg/m3 (the Earth has a density of around 5×10^3 kg/m3 ) A pebble 1 cm (0.01 m) radius, volume would be 4.188 x 10^-6, mass would be 4.188 x 10^11, That is 418800000 tonnes. And I don't think even 3 supermen could drag it. Most of the space in an atom is empty, the electrons orbit really far away from nucleus. Neutron stars are made when atoms are disintegrated, into its fundamental components nucleus, and electrons which rather than orbiting zip around closely. It wouldnt be brittle (atleast I think so). If you make a weapon with it like a sword and somehow figure a way to use it, you don't have cut people, people will be attracted to it all you have to do it point it at them, they would be crushed by the gravity. Making armours also wont work because things around would be attracted to it. You can make bullets for interstellar weapons and shooting at high speed at a planet, would wreck it. 

In my opinion, it wouldn't prioritize the most military-capable nations, but rather smaller nations which wouldn't incur the wrath of a nuclear power, and expand into many Doom Snakes, also it will realize nuclear war is imminent and use large scale smoke in mask its location. If it is fighting a nuclear power it will use cities and other populated areas, to avoid a nuclear attack. Almost all of the nuclear nations in our planet are capable of ICBM, once within range, (Russia, USA, and China have worldwide range) will take it about 30-45 minutes to hit the target. MIRVs for multiple targets/ creating decoys and SLBM for quick repose if nuclear submarine is near by. List of countries with nuclear capabilities under NATO include Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and Turkey (Needs permission/approval). Other than that Israel, India, Pakistan, North Korea, USA, Russia and China all have nuclear missiles. No country would use atomic weapons as mines, even the crude ones (Pakistan, North Korea) use it with a bomber, there are also few artillery nuclear weapons if combat is much more closer. Even Non-Nuclear countries would be able to defend it with heavy artillery and bombardments, wouldn't not be as effect as a single nuke, but modern warring nations would decimate it with shear raw force because planes/Jet are much faster and better at warfare than a terrestrial object. If a nanite-AI capable of what you describe exists, it would easily defeat human forces, even with nuclear weapon with a different more tactical strategy. Most likely to least likely 1) Tier 1 Countries either with nuclear weapons or strongly allied (existing treating) with nations with nuclear weapons, List is not limited to this USA and Nato, which is all of EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, Also Japan, South Korea, and Philippines,Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, North Korea. Also Countries which are very close to a nuclear nation, as it would see it as a very imminent threat, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Mexico, Mongolia Few of the Middle eastern countries, Most of Caribbean, Oceania Islands. Might also include countries which a nuclear power is in war with, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Also countries would defend economical interest like Panama or Suez canal. 2) Tier 2 would be non nuclear countries with immense military power, Brazil, and some South American Countries which are a little stable, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Singapore. 3) Tier 3 countries, have very little chance of defeating, with little to no advanced bombers, Countries already at civil war, South Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Most African countries some north African and Middle east countries, Papa New Guinea, Cambodia remote Islands. 4) Tier 4 Countries which cannot defend, nor would the doom snake be interested as lack resources, Includes North African Countries, Deserts, Antarctica. If countries would be fighting alone without any allies the list would much more different. 

Maybe This is a very complex question and depends a lot on the type of universe we live in, and we do not know enough about our universe to answer that. I am also gonna broaden the question to ask can a sentient (infinite processing power and memory) life achieve omniscience. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle would not be a issue, as it doesn't say you cannot determine the momentum and location of object at atomic scale, but rather say momentum and location cannot be inferred with certainty in a classical sense, and are probabilistic. Similar to how ideas of length does not matter beyond plank's length, or the idea of "before" does not matter prior to Big Bang. Even if we understand all aspects of our reality, a unified scientific theory which describes both micro and macro realities, there could be Hidden Variables in the universe which we can never know. We can never know what we cannot interact with (non-FTL), this includes anything outside our universe, beyond observable universe, even objects outside your causality cone. Even if we can predict or mathematically formulate the interactions in this region, it is not the same of direct observable data. But on the other side of things, similar to Quantum entanglement, the whole universe could be in some sort of coherence which makes omniscience possible, but we simply aren't advanced in science enough to know that. P.S. I personally believe that a version of omniscience is possible, and that is the reason for Fermi's Paradox. 

Cold War Cold war between two K2+ civilizations, treaties prohibit them from establishing automated/independent machine colonies in our solar system or our spiral arm. Providing weapons, and technology to another species would allow them to have access/allies without breaking treaties. If one of the K2 civ is expanding in our local area, other can give us technology and agitate us to commit terrorism [Mujaheedin funded by US to counter to USSR]. Situations similar to Vietnam/Korean War over ideology is also possible. 

Plausible Force Shields. Force fields can be achieved through a combination of multiple systems targeting a specific type of threat. As none of the following layers are connected directly to host/ship they do not necessarily experience any ill effects Newtons 2nd Law. Even in the most harsh situations they just have to move with shields. The outer layer consists of a supercharged plasma window, shaped into a dome or sphere by electromagnetic fields. This is hot enough to vaporize most incoming metals. A static supercharged plasma window for general purpose usage, and a manually controlled short range plasma window for directional threats, to be used as shields. A secondary layer underneath contains millions of curved laser beams, producing a high-energy web that captures projectiles fast or powerful enough to bypass the plasma window. A third layer consists of a "lattice" made from trillions of carbon nano tubes. These microscopic structures are woven together in an instant, forming a diamond-hard shell repelling objects missed by the other two layers. If necessary, this can be extended to cover a larger perimeter, at the cost of decreased strength. Conversely, it can be reduced in size to provide an even denser and more durable barrier. You can propagate the force around the host if necessary, without any disturbance to them. The layers described above can protect against the majority of bullets, bombs and projectiles. However, they are almost useless against lasers. A fourth and final layer takes care of this problem. This uses photochromatic particles, which change their properties when exposed to laser light, effectively neutralizing most directed-energy weapons. Similar to sunglasses that changed color when exposed to sunlight.
