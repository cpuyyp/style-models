Longer term, I foresee a spike in physics major enrollments, as people will get jolted into wanting to understand this clearly weird event. 

Has VERY little environmental mutagens in a specific location Low radiation, including solar; low rate of chemically-induced mutations as well High-mutagen environments on the borders between locales. #1+#2 means that individuals living far away from each other are very genetically diverse (because their ancestors crossed high-mutagen lines, AND their environments are somewhat different), while those living near each other are very genetically close. This introduces a strong pressure to introduce "far-away" genetic material into procreation if you want high genetic diversity Environment can change fast and unpredictably, meaning high genetic diversity is required to survive. Meaning that this "far-away" genetic material is a requirement need is a vital requirement, not a nice-to-have. High predation from tough predators, which means that at least one gender must evolve to be a strong fighter with good armor. This cannot be the child-bearing gender, because the biological cost of fighting/defending predators is too high if combined with biological cost of nurturing an offspring for the same individual (takes a LOT of biological energy to grow muscle and armor; and to train). Unfortunately, the same energy cost for a fighter means fighters aren't very mobile - that would require small/light body and preferably flight, which armor and fighting muscle heavily inhibits - see #5. High biological cost of geographical movement For example, small cells that can be used for foraging, separated by high walls (mountains/crater walls). As noted in #2, the highlands on tops of those walls are pretty much the only place where your genes are mutated. Let's make up some numbers: 

UPDATE: I was informed that my English terminology was incorrect. I was using the term "celibate", instead of the intended and correct "chaste". The idea was "no sex", not "no marriage". Earth had no shortage of religious movements that to some extent prized chastity. But they were all either: 

Engage the services of a leading Western media outlet (most of whom are and were left leaning at best, so #1 helps to achieve this too). One of the reasons Stalin was and is so popular with Americans is because New York Times was squarely in his corner. Walter Duranty got a Pulitzer for whitewashing Stalin. 

Also, as Google does, focus on less tangible benefits. Many will take less salary if I'm provided with a company swimming pool, or ping pong table, or subsidized bicycle parking, or other perks. Many more will take less salary if they are officially allowed to openly contribute to open source projects (for programmers) - it raises their own human capital value AND tickles their fancy. Reallocate lower-skill tasks to lower-skill, lower-paid employees. Personally, 20-30% of my own workload last week was spent doing BAU, lights-on, red tape, and other similar tasks that could very likely have been done by a lower-level employee. I don't have such a resource right now, since the company would spend more money hiring an extra employee, and I put in that 20% overtime. BUT, if they had to pay that 20% extra overtime, you bet my senior management would higher junior employee to take those tasks off of me; AND/OR hire extra developer resource to automate some of those manual tasks. Hire an extra Administrative Assistant for our team to take admin load off of ALL team members, not just Director level ones. As mentioned above, increase automation and productivity. It takes a lot of time to do things manually that could be automated - sometimes, because the team that could automate them has no resources to get to lower-impact automation requests. Automated voice transcription of meetings. Entering settings for 60 items I own piecemail, because the app for maintaining the settings has no functionality for bulk load from spreadsheet or applying identical setting to 15 things at once. Siri/Google-Now personal assistant that would do all the admin work for registering my vacation day automatically (enter into HR system + set out of office in Outlook + OOO on phone + entry in team calendar + entry in my own calendar + entry in project plan resource availability). Possibilities are endless, and today are largely not pursued because it's easier to have me stay 30-120 minutes late every day doing those tasks. On the "tighten the screws" side, track ONLY your productive time. Track how long you spend in the toilet (think it's ridiculous? Bloomberg company reportedly did just that, at least around 2000s). Track how long employees spend on Facebook etc... and subtract that from billable hours. Focus project management and resource allocation on only highest-payoff investments. I am currently responsible for 4 projects. 1 of them is a project that would likely not make all that much revenue/cost difference, even if it succeeds. Yet I still spent hours of billable time on it, because some manager or another liked the idea (THIS app should look THIS nice way. Literally. Just prettying things up, no big usability/productivity gains). 

One open question would be whether the planet's "mostly lacks metals" imply lack of fissionable material (Uranium). If not, you can have nuclear powered spaceflight, which by any and all estimates is vastly superior to chemical powered crap that our current civilization makes do with. 

Attract top star talent (they would be salaried, and their salary would be a very good investment due to the share of IP and human capital they bring). Basically, Google model - note that they already pay pretty well for their top-flight talent (20% projects, perks on campus, high salaries). Rebalance back towards heavier emphasis on performance bonuses and even equity awards (e.g. lower base salary, higher bonus). 

This question is very difficult to answer without knowing more details: technologicl levels/capabilities (do they have projectile weapons? How fast/dangerous/speed-of-firy are they?) Engineering levels/capabilities? Aerobatic characteristics of the species? (e.g. slow flying birds can be defended against by small movable walls, ala ping-pong paddle blocking). A couple of generic points can be made (some shamelessly stolen from Bean of Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series): 

For whatever reason, a religion arose among them that views advances in technology/science/inventions as sinful. Trivial to explain - the cause of original problem was biotechnology, so to prevent recurrence, the billionaires who built the generation ship decided to institute a "no progress" type religious practices. Over many years, that mutates into "no technology/science at all" religion, probably helped along by a less than sane "prophet" or two. Anyone who invents something new kets offed immediately, in public rituals. Pharaon/helot model (yes, I know i'm mixing my ancient civilizations. it just sounded way cooler). A small cadre of power holders on original ship decided that since they are heading back to Earth, they can take over control, and use the rest of population as slaves. As such, they killed off anyone who knew stuff (engineers, medics, etc...) who wasn't already part of the power circle's supporters. They also conspired to offload the rest of ship population without any technology, probably using fake emergency. Without knowledge base or access to technology, the rest fall into stone age in one generation. 

In practice, there's plenty of high-IQ people who hold awful political ideas. Tons of high-IQ people supported (pick your own awfulness from the list based on your political biases): Lenin, Mao, Hitler, Carter, Bush, Trump, Obama, Bin Laden, ISIS, Ghengis Khan, Holy Inquisition, human sacrifice, slavery, genocide, socialism, eugenics, nazism, etc... High-IQ people developed and supported the concept of using nuclear weapons, the concept of preemptive nuclear strike and the concept of MAD. If you go beyond subjective politics and try to find explanation for the above, you find an interesting and disturbing point. The more intelligent someone is, the better they are at motivated reasoning (which is an endlessly fascinating field of study, which mostly can be summed up as "people are gonna believe what they wanna believe and there's little that can be done to change their mind") See this study for the 'higher IQ' evidence. Or, to quote From Daniel Kahan's study "Ideology, motivated reasoning, and cognitive reflection": 

Based on #4 and #5, an average species's member can only forage enough energy to EITHER travel, OR reproduce/nurture offspring, OR gather food and defend the family from predation. But not 2 out of 3, never mind all 3. In this situation, we have a conundrum: 

The same way you convince humans to accept pretty much anything: panem et circenses. Give them a comfortable(ish) life; public safety; fun entertainment. Some elements of the former, preferably in addictive form. A vast majority of population will accept (and thus politically enforce, either via democratic voting or more forceful methods) whatever form of rule and system gives them that. It work(s|ed) for pretty much anything, from populace loving horrible dictators; to Putin love in post-Yeltzin Russia. AI overlords would be absolutely no different (and likely easier to accept, as there's no jealousy of "people" in power) 

Same reason anything happens in Earth politics. Interest groups/lobbying. Someone in Big Animal Agriculture (or whatever passed for it in your country at the relevant time) paid a hefty bribe/donation to law-making entity, to ensure a captive market. 

Yes. One approach would be biochemical. You can get pretty strong materials when you combine non-metallic advanced materials (composites, carbon nanotubes, advanced polymers, ceramics etc...) You can also GROW things you need (for SciFi example, see Yoozhan Vong of Star Wars EU's New Jedi Order era series, or tree spaceships from Saga of the Seven Suns). 

Most other answers seem to have ignored the OP's comment that only Internet is down, not phones. So I really don't think an apocalypse would happen, with dramatic permanent food shortages, cities burning, etc.. As such:
