I'm trying to figure out if a certain city, with these characteristics, is possible, geographically: 

How would you explain eclectic connections between magics, colors and inter-magic interactions? Such as this one for example: All spells are cast with colored gems... Gem colors and their effects when used in spells by themselves: Red: Fire, Explosions Green: Wind, Air, Lightning Dark Yellow/Orange: Earth, Metal, Endurance Light Yellow: Paralysis Purple: Poison Pink: Summoning Blue: Water, Ice, Healing, Black: Life Drain White/Silver: Anti-Magic 

As you said you want a sudden reveal like finding out a matching birthmark under clothes... From your comment: 

So... What's the mass to glass? Hmm... Apparently, the Earth's average density is 5.51 g/cm^3... But I don't know about sand... Which should compress better than Earth Average? Maybe?... Source: $URL$ Sand has a density of 2-3 g/cm^3? Source:$URL$ And we're glassing a cone that has a volume of ???... The formula is 1/3 * pi * (radius ^ 2) * height Source: $URL$ 

I'd say you need to really pin down what abilities each side has, and where they're located, for a start, because right now, this question seems too vague to have a clear answer. And to integrate my comment: Are nanobots a thing? If so, I'd expect the Cybers to integrate them into their tech... And then use them as weapons or something... Good weapons against things made of metal, would be liquid mercury, to weaken the metal? And it's also poisonous. But, liquid mercury can be protected against with anodizing or a plastic coating... Although, such protections may be inadvisable with cyborg parts, perhaps. In any case, mercury is still poisonous to the organic components, but there are methods to absorb it and render it harmless. 

So, a stable and growing celibate religion... but, doesn't need to be dominant, thankfully... Hmm... I'll have a cult that has a sex substitute as drugs or something... With those drugs being a euphoric libido killer... Perhaps make it so it's got even more reasons for joining the cult, like it makes you stronger, smarter, etc. Location... Africa or somewhere in the Americas, at a time where those locations didn't have a strong, cohesive, religious presence, so displacing the existing religions isn't hard... 

Can you get modern levels of health care, with no electric technology and no steam technology? Both electricity and steam are possible. Physics is the same as real life. Like... 

From Unsong: Chapter 2: Arise to Spiritual Strife: Replace "Name of God" with Runes, etc. Also, coincidentally, they have magic on scrolls as well. (This was not a coincidence, because nothing is ever a coincidence.) 

Effects when spell colors are used in combination with other gems: Red: Stronger Spells, or Strength Enhancement Green: Spell is copied, or Speed Enhancement Blue: Inflicts Poison or Paralysis Dark Yellow/Orange: Longer-lasting and/or homing 

What changes to the culture of 1950s Britain/England would be needed for a Female Archbishop of Canterbury, of the Anglican Church of that time period? She also has as much political power and social capital and all that kind of stuff as the OTL Anglican Church... So no "She's just a figurehead to appease the Feminists" or something like that. 

Could have its effects be dependent on purity (if it even can be impure), internal crystal orientation (like how magnetic substances have internal orientations) and possible side-effects accompanying the wanted effects, like all anti-grav also has high magnetism, or slowly spawns lightning storms. They might not know how to alter the crystals' properties reliably, with only known way to change the effects, is hitting it. Which might be dangerous, because reasons. Like it projects a force field and pushes people away or something. Also maybe zapping it with electricity, but that could be even worse, due to more energy input? If it breaks, then it can be pieced back together by just pushing the pieces together, but the fusion event is also dangerous, perhaps? The crystal could also emit bad radiation, like Gamma or something, making its infinite energy ability, be a detriment, in most cases. Unless your society has enough science to figure out precisely how the crystal gets energy, and you want to do that, then you can just leave it out, and mysterious. Not all ways for the appearance of infinite energy can be figured out from Victorian Science. 

But, what I'm mainly going for, is to justify my villagers of such a society to look as good as modern people could, sort of like a Historical Beauty Upgrade... Or... would that just require that they bathe like us, and know not to get their wounds infected and small things like that? 

Last brainstorm: Get a group of people genetically predisposed to dying early and those predispositions have a phenotypical signature, or something, and make a religion about having two groups breeding every so and so years, such that after 500/so and so years generations, you have a kid that dies on the 500th year of your religion... 

Breeding Program. Assumptions: Firestorm cooperates... and disregarding bio-compatability and ethics. If you put Firestorm in a breeding program then you get more Dragons after... let's say... 12 years. Yes, child soldiers, but we're disregarding ethics here. Then, you reinsert your New Dragons into the breeding program. With the average conception chance, 20-25% a month, spread out over, 1000 women? The chance of no Dragon Babies is around 10 to the -100th power... A very small chance. So, after a few decades, the country could be around 75% Dragon? That is, assuming that the other Dragons don't notice and shut the program down... but then again it's a Black Project, done in underground bunkers, and all that secrecy stuff. And modern military weaponry can easily handle even a torrent of Dragons... Also, the sperm donations wouldn't impact his "shape-shift into a human" abilities, so he's still a viable combat unit while participating in this program. 

Carbon-based life planet with a plenitude of infinite energy crystals. Could it exist? Somehow, when my planet cooled down, there were crystals that output a fixed amount of electromagnetic radiation for a crystal of a given size, and the size to power ratio is proportional. The crystals constant radiates some constant amount of photonic energy on all frequencies, and the photonic energy per frequency is the same for every frequency. All frequencies, means from light that has a Planck length wavelengths up to wavelengths that are the size of the observable universe. ... Having the frequency range be infinite would mean that the energy output is infinite, as a constant amount * infinity, is infinite... ... Would the given range even prevent one crystal from destroying the planet due to its energy output? A adult-male-fist-sized chunk radiates enough energy to run an android made by our modern technology 24/7/365 at full consumption. They weigh 1kg/m^3? Those crystals are distributed such that life on every part of the planet would adapt to use them? (I don't know how define values for distribution...) Perhaps distributed so that no crystal is so large that it ignites anything on contact? Basically, make sure the world doesn't have constant crystal-started fires.
