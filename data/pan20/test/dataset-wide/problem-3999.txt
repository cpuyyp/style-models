In some sense, this theorem tells you that you cannot diagonalize "against a Borel equivalence relation" in a "uniform" Borel way. The operation $E \mapsto E^+$ is known as the Friedman-Stanley jump. For any Borel equivalence relation $E$ with more than one equivalence class on a standard Borel space, $E <_B E^+$ where $\leq_B$ denotes the Borel reducibility. Indeed, Friedman's own proof that $^+$ is a jump operator makes use of the Borel diagonalization theorem. As a last remark, I should add that in the above paper Friedman claims that in order to prove this Borel diaganolization theorem in its full form, it is necessary to use $\omega_1$ many iterations of the power set of operation (Corollary 3.4), just like Borel determinacy theorem. Indeed, according to Lemma 3.2.5, there exists a constant $n \in \omega$ such that Borel determinacy up to Borel sets of rank $ \leq \alpha+n$ implies the Borel diagonalization theorem for Borel equivalence relations of rank $\leq \alpha$. 

Even though the question in the body is specifically restricted to first-order logic, the question in the title is not, so I will give an example that uses the infinitary logic $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$. Recall that a group $G$ is said to be universal locally finite if it is locally finite, every finite group is embedded in $G$, and any two isomorphic finite subgroups of $G$ are isomorphic via an inner automorphism. Philip Hall showed that such groups do exist and that any two countable universal locally finite groups are isomorphic. Kegel and Wehrfritz asked whether any two universal locally finite groups of cardinality $\kappa > \aleph_0$ are isomorphic. Shelah and Macintyre proved in this paper that the answer is negative. Their proof uses model-theoretic techniques in $\mathcal{L}_{\omega_1 \omega}$ to obtain models of every uncountable cardinality having countably many types over each countable subset. 

I have found two different definitions for integrable quaternionic structure in the literature, and I need to know if they agree with one another. One definition that I have found (from Differential Geometry of Lightlike Submanifolds - Duggal, Sahin) is that for an almost quaternion manifold, integrable quaternionic structure implies that there exists coordinates in each coordinate neighborbood whereby the three almost complex structures $J_1,J_2,J_3$ (that define the almost quaternionic structure) take the form $$ J_1= \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{array}\right] $$ $$ J_2= \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right] $$ $$ J_3= \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right], $$ where $1$ is the identity matrix. On the other hand, from this article, I have found a definition where integrable quaternionic structure implies that the Nijenhuis tensor for each of the almost complex structures given above vanish. Do these definitions agree? 

The toric manifold $\mathbb{CP}^1$ can be understood as a circle fibration over an interval $I$, with the circles having zero radius at the boundaries of the interval. How does one generalize this viewpoint to higher-dimensional projective spaces, i.e., $\mathbb{CP}^N$? Can we interpret, e.g., $\mathbb{CP}^2$ as the fibration of the torus $T^2$ over a square $I^2$ or disk? References would be appreciated. 

In reference [1], the index of the linearized operator for the symplectic vortex equations is computed on page 27-28. The first step of the proof says that the operator \begin{equation}\tag{1} \Omega^1(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}_P)\rightarrow\Omega^0(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}_P)\oplus \Omega^0(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}_P):\alpha\mapsto(-d^*_A\alpha,*d_A\alpha) \end{equation} has index $-\chi\textrm{ dim }G$. How does one show that this is true? My attempt to understand this is as follows. In reference [2], the index of the Cauchy-Riemann operator \begin{equation} (\nabla^A)^{0,1}:\Omega^0(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}_P)\rightarrow\Omega^{0,1}(\Sigma,\mathfrak{g}_P) \end{equation} is shown to be equal to $c_1(\mathfrak{g}_P\rightarrow\Sigma)+(\textrm{dim }G)(1-g)$ via Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem, and is just \begin{equation} \textrm{dim }G(1-g)=\frac{\chi}{2}\textrm{dim }G \end{equation} for compact $G$. Hence, it seems to me that the operator in equation $(1)$ is equal to the adjoint of $2(\nabla^A)^{0,1}$. This seems to be supported by the statement below equation (24) of reference [2]. Is my understanding correct? References [1] "The symplectic vortex equations and invariants of Hamiltonian group actions" ($URL$ [2] "Twisting gauged nonlinear sigma models" ($URL$ 

Perhaps, your confusion may be resolved by realizing that we do not define what a set is, using the axioms of ZFC. Sets are to us like points are to Euclid. Sets are the primitive objects that we are going to work with. Let me take a Platonist approach to elaborate. When you set up your axiomatic system, which is ZFC in this case, you assume that there is a universe of objects over which your quantification takes places. (Otherwise, you cannot attach semantics to your system.) Sets are simply the objects in the universe. Nothing more, nothing less. When you include a binary relation symbol $\in$ in the language of your axiomatic system, you assume that between any two objects $x$ and $y$ in your universe, the atomic formula $x \in y$ is either true or false. So, the answer to your question "what is the domain of this function?" is the following: The Platonic universe of sets, which is somewhere in the sky! Whether a sentence such as $\forall x \exists y \neg y \in x$ is true or not depends on whether for every set $x$ there is a set $y$ such that $x \in y$ does not hold. Since we do not have direct access to the Platonic universe of sets via our usual senses, we cannot directly check if this is the case. Consequently, we postulate that some statements about the universe of sets are true, namely, the axioms of ZFC. We then study the logical consequences of these axioms. Notice that the statement $\emptyset \in \omega$ is not true because we have some kind of logical function $\cdot \in \omega$ which checks the membership for $\omega$. It is true because it follows from the axioms which posit various facts about the relation $x \in y$. I admit that I don't fully understand what your problem is. But as you can see, you may give a meaning to all these without circular reasoning. You may also take a formalist approach and simply think of the game of proving the logical consequences of the axioms of ZFC without worrying about questions such as "what is a set?", "what does $x \in y$ mean?". 

Heuristic Background Consider a set of states labeled $n=1,2,...$ in order of non-increasing probability $p(n)$. The standard Shannon argument gives meaning to the entropy $S$ of $p$ in terms of the number of states needed to encode the distribution with small error in the limit of many iid copies. Roughly speaking I want to know how badly this can fail in the one-shot setting. My primary motivation is to understand how non-trivial it is to be able to show that $e^S$ states suffice to give small error for a given probability distribution. The distributions I have in mind have a system size-like parameter (like the number of iid copies) but the "copies" are correlated in a complicated way. Given the subject matter this may be a very elementary question, but I cannot seem to find much information on it. 

Question Fix a large number $S$. Let $p$ be a probability distribution with $p(n) \geq p(n+1)$ and entropy $S$, and let $p_S$ be the probability truncated to its first $e^S$ states i.e. $p_S(n \leq e^S) = p(n)$ and $p_S(n > e^S) = 0$. Is there a bound on the error $||p - p_S ||_1$ (varying $p$ with fixed $S$) or can I make this as close to one as I want? Thanks. 

Similar result for Renyi entropy I stumbled upon a weaker version of this result before finding Lemma 2 of $URL$ which also gives a simple proof using majorization. Let $p_\chi$ denote the probability distribution truncated to its $\chi$ largest values (see above), and let the error be $\epsilon = ||p-p_\chi||_1$. "Lemma 2": If $S_\alpha = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \ln{\left(\sum_n (p(n))^\alpha\right)}$ is the Renyi entropy then we have $ \ln{(\epsilon)} \leq \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} \left(S_\alpha - \ln{\left(\frac{\chi}{1-\alpha}\right)}\right)$ for $\alpha <1$. This gives a partial answer to my question in that keeping roughly $e^{S_\alpha}$ states for $\alpha <1$ is guaranteed to lead to small error.
