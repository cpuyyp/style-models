I find it helpful to think of this issue using the traditional "square of opposition". According to it, we have amongst others (see $URL$ for a full explanation and a diagram of the whole square) the following theses: (1) "All Fs are G" entails "Some Fs are G" (2) "No F is G" is equivalent to "All Fs are not G". When there are some Fs, all is well with the traditional square. But when there are no Fs, we cannot keep both (1) and (2). Why not? Suppose there are no Fs. Then "No F is G" is true, so according to (2) "all Fs are not G" is true. But then according to (1) "some F is not G" is true. But from this it follows that there are Fs after all. The modern solution to this problem is to reject (1) and keep (2). It follows that if there are no Fs, then we have for every G that "no F is not G" is true and so from (2) that for every G whatsoever "every F is G" is true, which is the conclusion that you rightly find counterintuitive. We could have opted for a solution that rejects (2) instead of (1). But there isn't a solution which keeps every aspect of the traditional square of opposition. Since the traditional square is intuitive, there isn't a solution which doesn't have counterintuitive consequences somewhere. 

This begs the question - What does it mean to see a nouminal object? How is this different from phenomenal seeing? To get around this semantic difficulty, I shall use perceive to refer to nouminal observations. Claim : For an entity to perceive an object, that entity must be that object. Argument : If the entity were external to the object, it wouldn't have access to all features of the object. (A feature is one which could be perceived, thereby making the object a union of its perceivable features).. Example : Sam hears his own voice when he speaks and then frowns upon hearing his recorded voice. Which of the two is closer to his nouminal voice? The answer, of course, is his own voice as he speaks and not the recorded sample, as the recorded sample has passed through several filters thereby making it a phenomenal observation. 

Not quite. Darwinian evolution, as it is, diverges significantly from our current moral systems. Our morality can be better derived from a combination of logical truisms along with the human conditions of well being and suffering. These are, as can be demonstrated largely orthogonal to Darwinian truisms and any sense of morality coming as a result thereof. Sure, there are examples, such as triage where our morality can be truly considered Darwinian, but a simple consideration such as the quality of life of the disabled, will show that this can by no means be a generalization. 

There are 2 things that would help you explore this further. The first is how Aristotle defines 'Substance' in the context of his '10 Categories of Being' (Organon - Categories - start with the primary source here (part 5), or look for a translation in your first language, and a secondary source discussion here). In layman's terms, I like to think of this as 'the goo from which the universe is made, that we recognise as something because it has a particular form'. But ... what do we really recognise? Content or form? If we knew each other and you saw me from a distance, recognised me, and waved, you'd have seen my form, but you'd simultaneously have recognised me. Are these 2 things or 1? In your example, in basic terms, if you pointed at the marble, and asked, 'What is it?' Your simplest, shortest, most precise answer in each case would have to be, 'It's a marble'. But what is it that makes it a marble? This brings me to the second thing that will help out - Aristotle's four principles of causation, referenced in your link - material, formal, efficient and final. They're interdependent. The marble is a marble because it conforms to the ideal of 'marbleness', the material it's made of allows it to display that form, for that to happen, someone somewhere (we're talking of a man-made object here) must have made it, and to do that, they must have had a reason, the simplest, most obvious one being, 'to make a marble'. Sure, your material can change, but what happens to the other elements of the marble when you focus just on the material? Do they suddenly disappear? And where does substance fit in? Some questions for you to ponder on as you explore this subject. Enjoy! 

Blame should always go side by side with intent. Since the gambler didn't have any intent for the murder of his cousin, he cannot be blamed for the murder. Every event which occurs, has numerous prerequisites, the non-occurrence of even one of which would prevent the event from happening. For ex, while going to the anonymous group, there might have been a traffic jam due to a lousy driver, which led to them being late by a few minutes and running into the muggers. Had there been no jam, they would have got there a few minutes early thereby avoiding the muggers. In such a case, it is just faulty thinking to blame the lousy driver for a murder. 

Philosophy is one way to arrive at morals without religious support. This is indeed a good backing of religious morality, to give people who aren't going to philosophize all day, a book on religious code of conduct. A good example of the above, is to realize that most religions converge on most issues of morality, even though the histories of said religions might have been completely different.
