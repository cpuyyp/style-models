Not released now one might think: "I know, but..." In that case there there was the case of improper attention by not having had admirable association out of lack of devotion, out of lack of faith. In that case, if not willing to uproot this by approaching the Juwels in the right way, find access to them by lowering, by giving up, by seeking refuge, there is no way, no short cut that right view could be developed, right release be gained. For such as "knowing" and still doubt, such can not be. That was why it was sad: "For the purpose of release: Not-knowing (right) is the cause of addiction, tanha, Eggmann." And what is the cause, what is the reason for faith? Suffering, being confronted to give up, to seek for release, is the reason why one takes on faith. For one havving gained right view, had attended proper, listened proper, seen and reminds the Dhamma, just then: 

might give foundation for defilements to regard there ideas for right, but such does not cover what is called skillful or path contuctive. The wish to help other beings has nothing to do if one is actually able or not, regardless of lack in oneself or by handicaps of others: boundless, meaning that all beings are to be included. Of course such as to develope karuna requires such as compassion or pity toward one self first. This requires the understanding that one actually need to be helped, misses certain things for having no kind of suffering. If one does not see dukkha, one does not see ground for help. Not knowing dukkha in one self, not spoken about the cause, how can one develop even desire to help other? There is no being that is not subject to suffering, knowing it or not. To be able to develope conductive compassion it is required to have right view, without right view, the following parts of the eightfold path, which are in fact deeds of compassion, starting with virtue outwardly, can not come into be. Developing right compassion, even to expand it torward all beings is therefore not possible for a wordily mind, person, but might be so fare, "just" a training. 

Things to consider in regard of the OP's Question, since a proper Question would be: "How do I adress monastics, Brahmans and ascetics in a way that it is of most benefit for me?" To understand the merit an demerit of paying respect a little, my person wrote a "wiki-like" articel, supported by members here: Respect and Veneration In bodily regard: Is you aspect being taught well by a Monk, you should consider that especial a Bhikkhu is not allowed to teach to someone: 

(If situations and views are hold, monks are equal to others here) All this things are not conductive in regard of peoples respect in reagard of the Dhamma. For Monks themselves also a personal protection. In regard of demand and compensation: Monks, keeping Vinaya, do not and never teach for rewards or let the taught be bound by any contacts or demands. Accepting gifts, rewards or other things as reward for teaching is not the way of the Noble Ones and there are rules to cut off possible corruption of the Dhamma in that way. So gifts as well as the gift of veneration is good placed in advanced to gain most benefit and make it acceptable. Speech: What ever feel proper to one, thinking on someone who is not only high above one self but also could give one the highest gift possible to give. Usual ways are to express his worthy be calling him Ven. Sir, Lord, Lord of Compassion, Ven. Teacher and if in Pali, as usual, "Bante". For female likewise. In third person, whether he is at place or not, its also good to do such in that way. If there are more Monks, put the name behind. Its not usual and polite to use the "Status/Profession" like Bhikkhu, Samanera, monk, Samana. Consider always, that a ordained person has actualky no gains be receiving respect, and if he/she takes such not worthy of it, he/she just accumulte depts. Giving or not giving in this regard is the doers benefit or demerit, whether he/she knows or not. Not knowing does not eliminate causes. Its also good to have mistrust is monks and laypeople associate like friends and adress each other very familar. Generally again, this topic is very large and it is good if one maybe takes the linked article and asks further questions in detail. Modern people today must be aware that they are usuall taught and trained in a post-modern or "communistic" way, wrong view, empathizing all are equal. In such an enviroment, under such believes, its never possible to gain anything, how much Dhamma ever one would read, be taught... gains in ways not in line of Dhamma. Keeping precepts and being tended to virtue (of what veneration of what is worthy of verneration is on part) and to take Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha really as refuge, venerate by heart, are the signs of a faith follower, and stream-enter, both no more able to fall off the path of liberation. If you are a person with long meditation practice or of much knowledge in Dhamma, if you are a virtuose person for your self and consider your self as experianced and still have problems and aversions in regard of Veneration, it is a good sign that such a practice was not based on Right View and the refuge is not really taken. Its a really good working place to get ride of very raw defilements and at the same time also possible to drop down all clinging aggregats just by a poor cousin treaded single deed. Asking Questions: While it is not wrong for a Monk to teach even not invited, one does good when raising a question, to adress an venerate possible present persons proper. That is also generally. While usuall everywhere is very rude and a sign of low education and virtue, to put just ones question into the "marked" without kind greatings. Even if a person of good contact enters a shop, here a costumer, he would great friendly and show signs of politeness. So generally people incl. the moderators have a lot of work if wishing to be frequented by Monks aside of just short visits and those with certain improper aims, using such places like most here, for certain other gains outside good or no trade. Those follow the tradition of the Noble Ones will never addopt certain social and timely usuals but hold on that others, being willing, are able to addopt those, step by step, leaving both improper ways of live in the world or even the eorld behind. Like every teaching, this words are originated by compassion, and not made to demand anything. What ever one gives is the givers reward. So is it with taking. Addition in regard of "warm" adresings: In SEAsia is very common to use Ven. father, grandfather, oncle, great brother... Such is usual under uneducated people and not really proper, althought both might like it. One would adress a lay priest of a village or his honored father or granduncle like wise. Such as brother or sister are merely usuals comming from commonist countries and, in setting even equal, totally improper. Its good to use respectful "cool", with proper distance, adresses. Such is very common in "Guru" paisas and put single individuals high and warm. While of course no problem for uninstructed people with raga- or saddha-charita, a good instructed person does not use such warm adressings.

Dheeraj Verma, It is described as nicca, unchangeable "stage" if reached, but since all Dhammas are anatta, it would be not unconditioned proper to regard it as such (atta), and the Buddha would have (like popular movements, Dhammakaya in Thailand for example and many individual teacher, doing laypeople a favor with such notion) easy more followers, since beings delight in "being". Of cause one can call it "true"- Self, if one seeks sense or Self in it. But it would not hold. If understanding "real self" as senseless, meaningless, as like somehow "aṭṭa", than it will probably hold. Consider the three meanings of aṭṭa carefully, high confussing or giving realese. Since one might see the base of atta and anatta, as a "game" of perceptions, stands. Certain Brahmic-Attman- and certain Mohayanic-appoaches, are dangerous, had lead to bad thing in history, on it's account. The Dhamma of the Buddha is not taught for certain Self-seeking, true self-purposes, but to get free from suffering. He rebuked a "rebelling" monk who said, "if you don't tell me if there is a Self or not, I will return to lower life", with asking himn "Did I ever told you that I will regard this matter, will ever teach such, as you ordained?" (Careful read and proper attention was required to understand, for the case not, not grasp the message, after the finder, not looking at the moon) 

Ransara, Yes, in regard of the question, it's possible that one is not aware of certain paths and fruits. As for the Arahat, my person is not sure about it, but one could investigate some situations in the Suttas. Many do not know their current wealth, but that is mostly good, since it caused suffering thinking "I am this or that", not to speak of questioning "Am I this or that. So when asking your self or other, simple ask if this or that work has been already done. So if not "the task is done, there is no more further for this world (or a next)" arsises, is know simple: Work, and take on all possible given possibilities for it. One having done Not easy to do Should not be scared To delight in it Nor should one Reject done merits. For it is hard To gain such a life And its even harder To gain such again: Meeting either The good Dhamma Or upright leading man. What ever good Has been done Achived, sacrified, Only those delighting, In deeds hard to do, Having gratitude, Form themselves and In regard of others Their sacrifies, their deeds, Are able to carry themseves Beyound.

Note that "reflection", which you used in the question, is actually wisdom/"knowing" (paññā), or discrimination, such as reflection requires sati (mindfullness) and paññā. Since knowledge at first place, having hear/read the good Dhamma, this might be most usefull to fullfil the answers demand on it's root. 

To answer it in a middle way notion with words of Buddhas disciples, actually walking and teaching the middle way, and not just defending their usuall habits as bing a compromiss between knowing the right and possessing capability of letting go in certain hypocritical ways as following. So it comes from people knowing and having right mastered situations of having a gun on the head in ways of Dhamma as well and not just ideas and opinions about it:

Practicing meditation in South Mississippi, USA, without easy access to a sangha or teacher, and reading Buddhist literature (primarily Theravadan), I feel a need to attend a week to ten day meditation retreat in accordance with Theravadan practices. I am retired, so my typical daily practice comprises sitting for at least an hour in the wee hours, and occasionally another 1hr+ sit in the evening. I would like to attend a retreat that lasts at least a week. However, I can't afford to pay much money. Are there Theravada meditation retreat opportunities in the USA that offer a visitor the option to work for room and board? 

What is the value in a regular vipassana meditation practice (e.g. almost daily, some days twice, typically 1hr+ per session) if, over the long haul (months), annicca, dukkha and annatta are not realized? Is the absence of these three very Buddhist characteristics an indication that the practice is, essentially, a secular practice with little-to-no spiritual value? 

If I, this impermanent and suffering and no-self array of aggregates, am journeying through this human realm now, shall I assume that that which was "my prior life", another impermanent and suffering and no-self array of aggregates, was also journeying through the human realm (i.e. a prior human existence is a prerequisite for a subsequent human existence)? I am inclined to think that it is possible for an individual array of ever-fluxuating potentialities to "pass" through the human realm consecutively a number of times. 

"It appears that Buddhism depends on a central premise -- that all worldly existence = suffering / dukkha." This is a correct result of an investigation. "Are there Buddhist teachers or traditions that teach a joyous approach to worldly life?" There are many if not most "Buddhist Teacher" and Traditions calling themselves after the Noble Ones. How ever, neither the Buddha, nor his good following desciples, not teacher of the Buddhas Dhamma do such. Why? Becaus they tell what is true and conductive for the path. Every time that one does not see the danger, does not put effort into the training, is wasted time. You can enjoy the reat when work is done. "Are there any teachings that profess existence is a joyous, if sometimes painful experience, or at least a tolerably pleasant experience? An eternal roller-coaster ride of birth-and-death, joy and sorrow, that one need not seek to escape?" There are, but not founded in Buddhas Dhamma. Mara constanty teaches such and so those overwhelmed of him as well. Who ever does not see him/herself the first noble truth, or reject faith, firm faith in it, is incapable to make any long therm conductive and wholesome use of Buddhas teachings, is still a wordling and regarded as outsider. In regard of the main Question: "Is it necessary for a Buddhist to believe that existence is suffering?" A self called "Buddhist" may believe what ever he wants, and yes, there have always been follower not really knowing the deeper sense of Buddhas teaching and he did not much worry about it. 

Late Upasaka Goenka gave a very detailed teaching, based on cannonical references: Why Was the Sakyan Republic Destroyed?, Robert Michael. On seeing the importance here: Dhamma is unwisely grasped, if used for politic and wordily gains: 

As this sample shows, such can lead to not benefical situation for one, thinking "how arrogant". Lowering others, praising oneself... yet teaching that such is not good... Broad believe is that the Dhamma teaches generally not so speak about ones good qualities and skills, which seems to be paradox when facing such and lead possible to questions like: 

-- Reflection on death -- Reflectikn on the (parts) of the body -- Reflection on (one of the 10) corpse -- Reflexion on the uglyness of food Best possible to see suffering if one leaves the palace, the secure home and inspects the world outside a little: hospitals, cemeteries, slayer halls... might be possible near. Or reflective listening to certain lyrics of Iron Maiden, Metallica... reflective, not singing, delight in sound and stressed bang the head... [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Does anybody know the reference in the Suttapitaka (thinking Atma came accross one time there)? Does anybody know which Ven. K. Gunaratana Thera wrote this book and some infos, biography and picture of him? Maybe even contact possibility, if still alive? If inspired and knowing also the references of other stories in the book, willing to research them, feel invited to take on this possibility. 

Mr/Mrs Lasan, Difficult would it be for a monk, Lasan, even more difficult for a householder... and not easy possible jet not by one self a Noble one: 

Once two old people approached the Buddha, Upasaka Saptha Visuddhi, and told that they missed to made merits, now fearing death. The Buddha, honest forward, for the sake of benefit for many listening to it, Simply said, that they fear righteously and then utterd: 

Mudita. An possible extended answer, as well as possibility to ask further and discuss, can be found here, invited, given and welcome: [Q&A] What happens when your tank is empty, and you’ve got nothing left to give?

Approaching yr68, I have committed my share of unwholesome conduct over the years, the typical errors of middle-class youth and adulthood in this USofA. I've been practicing sitting meditation for close to two years, and am most comfortable with Theravada vipassana concepts and practices, though I have not taken lay Buddhist vows. I generally sit "with the breath" for one hour most every day, some days see two sessions. I have not yet realized "access concentration". I am perplexed that I never have feelings of remorse or shame or guilt over past deeds arise during sitting, and only rarely have I experienced strong feelings of gratitude or happiness. Might I assume that it is only a matter of time before "the stuff hits the fan" and I find myself overwhelmed with "remorse or shame or guilt" during sitting meditation? 

I'm confused. What is the distinction between craving/hating (desire/aversion) and "ego"? I am inclined to believe that ego, i.e. one's false sense of an independent separate eternal self, learns and developes craving/aversion, beginning during childhood. Perhaps there is no distinction, and the query is really a matter of semantics. Might "ego" be the noun that represents the verbs "craving and hating"; or, might the ego represent a broader condition than craving and hating? The word "ego" brings to mind "I me mine" identity, which might include "craving/hating".
