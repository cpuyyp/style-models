With respect to Britain, there was an understanding between Churchill and Roosevelt that the UK would free it's colonies after the war. Atlantic Charter Specific terms described in this article are 'A key American aim was to force a change of British policy in regard to its Empire. America realized the precarious position of Britain, reliant as she was on US military aid, and intended to exploit this by forcing a commitment to self-determination, and an open door policy on resources.'. France still had colonies in Africa after WW II. Many of the French colonies were granted self-determination in the 1950s and 1960s. Some of these were the result of bloody insurgencies, particularly in Algeria. WW II exposed the true cost of defending far flung possessions. Britain, with a population of 40 million, was responsible for defending the quarter of the Earth's surface that it 'possessed' going into WW II. Most of Europe had lost interest in military adventures following the carnage of WW I. Once it was clear further military investment would be essential, European countries ended most claims of sovereignty outside their historical borders. Exceptions tend to be islands that continue to rely on defense and civil administration from a much larger host. 

If one has two parents and four grandparents, then when one goes back ten generations one has potentially 2^10th, or 1024 ancestors of the 10th generation. This becomes 1 million potential ancestors at the 20th generation and 1 billion at the 30th. If each generation is roughly 25 years, then 30 of them is 7.5 centuries, which would be in the area of 1253 AD. It is doubtful, although possible, that there were 1 billion humans on earth in 1253 - therefore everyone alive today is potentially descended from everyone alive at the time that produced descendants into the current generation. While 25 year generations is common now, it has been traditional to marry girls at age 14, therefore most generations may average 20 years, and in that case we go back 600 years to 1413 AD. This is within a century of Columbus arriving in the Americas. By the end of this century, DNA from even the remotest settlements should be thoroughly mixed into the global population. It would be safe to say that modern Greeks have some DNA from Greek ancestors 2300 years ago, but they will also have DNA from Hutus, Mongols, and even Incas. 

The major wars of the 20th century have certain things in common with the .COM boom and the so called 'space race', but are not comparable, in the same respect, to more historical armed conflicts - examples being the Gallic wars of Julius Caesar or, for example, the War of 1812. The opening question is: what's the difference between building a house and launching a Mars expedition? When one builds a house, much of the infrastructure for construction and materials production is already in place: one has wood, concrete, plumbing, wiring, and appliances available at one's fingertips. The contractors are standing by with bulldozers, concrete trucks, nail guns, and pipe benders. In comparison, the Mars expedition incurs a huge amount of trial and error improvisation all along the supply chain - one is building a lander, on-planet housing, water purification, food production technology, launch facilities, instrumentation, and so forth. Therefore one has to build infrastructure to build infrastructure. When one observes the progression of the US space program, one sees vast amounts of innovation in electronics, materials, life support, computation, facilities construction, 'food engineering', and so forth. The .COM boom required the production of vast quantities of routers, fiber, servers, network software, browser software, email servers, etc. These put an inordinate demand on the entire global workforce. What one sees in WW I is innovation in submarines, aircraft, diesel engines, airships, and tanks, and in WW II innovation in nuclear physics, electronics, aircraft, submarines, radar, and codebreaking. This was not merely 'putting a lot of people to work' in factories, as well as on the front, it also demanded all out effort from academics, scientists, engineers, and designers. The distances involved, particularly in the Pacific theater, demanded a lot of work just to ship things around. Someone growing corn and raising chickens wasn't merely feeding troops, but merchant seamen, transport pilots, road builders, truck builders, and so forth. WW II was a vast waste of human potential and treasure, however what was left over contributed significantly to the economic boom of the 1950s. One can see at least three influences: the first is the production resources created during the war, the second is the new technologies, and the third is the workforce that had learned how to make and operate all this new stuff. Much of WW II was fought over enormous distances, and in certain respects this meant that a lot of the war effort was logistical rather than belligerent. The United States had to maintain supply lines to Britain, Australia, the Philippines, and China at various stages of the war, including transportation by sea and air. At the end of the war, much of this was immediately pressed into civilian service. 

Does 'half-decked' refer to how the decks were constructed? Or perhaps something to do with how the ships were loaded with cargo? 

While not a student of Toynbee AFAIK, Carroll Quigley worked from Toynbee's theories in The Evolution of Civilizations with a lengthy discussion of the state of Western Civilization. This was written in 1961 with a second edition in 1979, so also predated the end of the Cold War. However he made some predictions for what stage Western Civilization is in that might be of interest. He observed that while most other civilizations followed the path of growth to empire and then to inevitable decay, Western Civilization has differed in that it has "gone to the brink" of empire multiple times only to shift itself back into expansion. He draws the following periods for Western Civilization: 

On the topic of the Aztecs, an intriguing book on this subject is Aztec Warfare: Imperial Expansion and Political Control, by Ross Hassig. The Aztecs were an extremely war-like civilization, that were constantly attacking and subjugating their neighbors. Interestingly, though, their style of warfare was quite different from what we are familiar with from western european history. For the Aztecs it was all about taking prisoners. The more prisoners you could bring home to sacrifice to the gods, the higher your standing. Thus, weaponry, tactics, and military strategy were all geared around maximizing capture of the enemy rather than defeating them in detail. They didn't really care about securing administrative control over their conquests quite the way the Europeans did, and often allowed the conquered to continue under their existing leadership, so long as they continued to send tribute. Typically the Aztec army would set forth from the capital at the start of the war season and go from one town to the next. They might start with towns that were lax in their tribute or that had refused to give it. When they appeared at a town, those people had the choice of surrendering or going to war; the Aztecs would be particularly harsh to those that resisted to dissuade others from doing the same. Flower War was another interesting warfare technique rather unique from European war; the nobility would leave their regular troops and engage in non-lethal battle with nobility of neighboring empires. These did not result in capitulation of their enemy, but were done for practice, honor, and to "test" the strength of the opponents. I suppose there is some analogy to the jousting tournaments of the European middle ages. Thus the Aztec empire was always a bit amorphous, with cities and towns shifting in allegiance depending on the strength of the king, the proximity of the army, and heaviness of tribute demands. The empire was maintained not by territorial control via castles and forts, but rather indirectly via political influence, propaganda, and fear. It also meant that the maximum effective range of the Aztec empire was limited to how far the army could march in one war season. Thus, while the Aztecs probably would have no qualms about conquering, say, Texas, the structure of their civilization would just not support such a long range expedition. Also, the central Mexico basin was a very agriculturally rich area and supported very large populations. Outside this area populations were more scarce. So I think the Aztecs would not be as interested in areas far from them where captives would be harder to obtain and more time consuming to bring back for sacrifice. While the Aztecs were distinctive compared with Europe, they didn't live in a cultural vacuum. Neighboring empires followed similar style warfare, prisoner capture, flower war, and so on. Religious practices, agricultural technology, war strategy, and more would drift northward, influencing the practices of other Native American tribes. The Flower Wars remind me much of the "counting coup" of the plains indians for instance. For contrast, I'd suggest reading Empire of the Inca by Burr Cartwright Brundage. The Incas engaged in war for keeps. They didn't take captives for sacrifice, they wanted territory. When they took a new region, they'd transfer some loyal families from Cuzco to serve as the conquered region's ruling class. Dissidents would be rounded up and relocated elsewhere in the empire. The Incas would terrorize the newly acquired until they accepted the Emperor's law without question. They also practiced warfare in a much different fashion. War was not to win social standing but to take territory, so their armies were organized much more differently; as they often faced enemies fortified in cliff-high strongholds they developed "tortoise" shield-rush tactics that would have impressed the Romans. Logistics were the Inca's particular talent. While marching within the borders of their empire, they would enlist the commoners of the province as porters to carry goods from one end of the province to the next, whereapon they'd hand off to people of the next province. The people would open up their granaries to supply the marching army; foraging and looting were strictly forbidden. The Incas also had a unique ability to "snowball" as they took new lands. Upon taking a new province they immediately enlisted the military man power of that province into their army, to be used as the cannon fodder for their next campaign. This both strengthened their army and depleted the resistance power of the new province. [Update] A third book I've been reading lately is 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, by Charles Mann. This goes into much more detail into both the Aztec and Incan empires - from how they arose to how they fell - as well as surveying other Indian civilizations throughout North and South America. In school learning about the Native Americans, I was given the impression of the Americas as being populated by two civilizations (the Aztecs and Incas) and everywhere else was just nomadic people. This book really drives home the point that this was far from true: There are traces of complex farming civilizations dotting all over North and South America, that apparently died out of disease or other causes well before being encountered by Spanish or other explorers, for which little is known. As well, going back through time there was a rich history of other geographically extensive civilizations prior to the Aztecs and Incas - the Mayans and Olmecs are perhaps the best known of these but there were many, many more. 

Is there a reliable objective study that addresses this issue? No. There are several dimensions that would have to be addressed. I can hint at what they are, with the intention of exposing some of the inherent conflicts of such an inquiry. First, there is no doubt that various laws and court cases that were established in the 1950s and 1960s ended institutional racism. Johnson was instrumental in some of these, but they were not necessarily 'Great Society'. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, in particular, was not an attempt at an economic program, it was focused on eliminating state laws that institutionalized discrimination. 'Great Society' acted pro-actively, often but not always in economic terms. Head Start is one educational program that most view as an unqualified success. Over the span of it's existence, it has consistently helped the children that were enrolled in the program. The Higher Education Act of 1965 vastly expanded federal funding of higher education, including the provision of low interest student loans. The value of this is probably described as a bell curve, with positive and negative aspects evenly distributed around the mean. On the one hand, many people who deserved access to higher education were able to act on it. On the other hand, many of those who enrolled were viewed as not having met the same qualification criteria as non-minority students, and felt ostracized. Retrospectives on this aspect suggest this caused real harm. It may also have created more systemic hazards. As the Federal Government supplies more and more of the money to higher education, it also politicizes campus policies, and has created severe distortions that in some cases impinge on student freedom of speech and due process. It also appears to be suffering a problem similar to crop subsidies, more students are graduating with degrees than can find jobs that require college educations. This can negatively affect minorities that don't have college or even high school educations, as they are crowded out by non-minorities with more complete attainment. Larger Economic Framework The industrial revolution sparked a collection of redistributionist philosophies, Marxism being one of them. While social systems are always redistributionist to some degree, the doctrine of economic central planning didn't really take hold until Stalin took control of the Soviet Union. Just because the communists took over in 1918 doesn't mean that the central planning apparatus suddenly materialized out of nowhere, this took time to implement. The experience with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany also appeared in the 1930s, particularly after Germany had been through the hyperinflation of the 1920s. Therefore, at the point in time that MLK was proposing a restructuring of the US economy, 'the facts weren't in'. While the German and Italian economies had been released from centralized authority, little was really understood about how the Soviet experiment was running. It would be another decade or two for the bankruptcy of that order to be certain. In the meantime, in the period from 1945 to 1972, the US 'owned the world'. Europe and Japan were rebuilding from nearly total destruction. The US population exploded from about 135 million to 200 million between 1945 and 1963. This triggered massive construction of housing, freeways, aircraft, telecommunications infrastructure, and consumer goods. With the arrival of television, those that were locked out of this economic bounty were seeing it day to day, one can review any number of the classic 1960s sitcoms to imagine how that was being received by people living in tenements. The idea that someone halfway through their life in the 1960s now had the 'opportunity' to get better employment, was, overall, pretty useless. Without education or experience someone at age 35 was not going to shift from warehousing to doctor or attorney. This would take time, for many, they had been waiting long enough. Given the economic power of the US at the time, the idea that it should be shared had a lot of political support. Thus it was easy to enact rafts of legislation for Medicare, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Food Stamps, student loans, etc. Many of these didn't go all that far at the time, such programs were expanded later, both in terms of services provided and as to who was served. This has created a massively larger government, and is coincident with deficit spending and rapidly rising government debt. The legislation that was enacted in the 1960s would have been 'affordable' if it had remained in it's original scale. The two problems were that the scale expanded, and that people became dependent - not merely as recipients but as government workers employed in the vast bureaucracy. Many of these workers are minorities - people that wouldn't have had such jobs had the agencies didn't exist. Needless to say, as government employees they are better off than they might be sweeping streets, however in this role they do not face market forces, and therefore have little incentive to adapt to changing circumstances. What we are finding now is that attempts to simply downsize government and reign-in public sector benefits is a 'third rail', touch it and you're dead. As this continues, the government continues to draw a disproportionate slice of the economic pie, leaving everyone worse off.
