The solution to an optimal contract problem is called "first best" if it maximizes the principal's objective function subject to all constraints except the incentive constraints. The solution to an optimal contract problem is called "second best" if it maximizes the principal's objective function subject to all constraints, including the incentive constraints. Usually, one calls a contract "second best" only if it differs from the "first best" contract. 

A good article to read about this is by Susan Athey, Jonathan Levin and Enrique Seira. It has the title: "Comparing Open and Sealed Bid Auctions: Theory and Evidence from Timber Auctions," was published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 126(1), 2011, 207-257, and is available online at: $URL$ The abstract includes this: "We study entry and bidding patterns in sealed bid and open auctions. Using data from U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we document a set of systematic effects: sealed bid auctions attract more small bidders, shift the allocation towards these bidders, and can also generate higher revenue. A private value auction model with endogenous participation can account for these qualitative effects of auction format." 

Debt is not exactly free money. It is 'free' money (apart from interest) only if you can be depended on to pay back that debt. In other words, investors are willing to lend money to a government if they are sure that the government will pay them back. Failing to pay back your debt would require your country to declare bankruptcy (or drop out of the global financial system altogether). The reason why governments like the U.S. can keep borrowing money is because investors believe that the U.S. can easily make enough money to pay them back in the future. This is based on the debt to GDP ratio. If your debt to GDP ratio is too high (say, 10 to 1) that means it might be quite difficult for the country to pay back all that debt. The current U.S. debt to GDP ratio is between 0.7 and 1.0, which is relatively high (a result of the Great Recession). Another smaller country might not be able to easily borrow with such a high debt to GDP ratio, but the U.S. also has credibility - it has not defaulted on its debts before, unlike some other sovereign states (Argentina). Combined with the fact that the U.S. has large financial clout and is relatively important, investors feel that the U.S. government is unlikely to default on its debts. If the U.S. government were to keep on borrowing money, eventually people would get a little concerned with the amount of debt it has taken on. It's possible to think of sovereign debt in a similar way to personal (your) debt. For example, if you own a credit card, you can use that credit card to get 'free' money and use that money to purchase things. The reason why banks are willing to lend you this money is because you have previously paid them back. If you were to (1) ask for a lot more money than you make (e.x. $100 million) or (2) ask for money after failing to pay the bank back at the end of the month, the bank would reject you. Investors, like the bank, require governments (and individuals like you) to meet some requirements before they are willing to lend you money. 

Let our thesis be that it is the latter, and let's see if we run into a contradiction. Consumer surplus Let's take the simple straight line $p+q=25$, where a constant unit-price of 5 prescribes a demand of 20: 

To me, this reads as follows: for an individual, the demand function answers, for all values of $p$, the question: "if the price is $p$ per unit, how many units $q(p)$ would the individual buy?" As an example, let's consider my personal demand curve $q = 10-p$ for a certain good. I would interpret that, also with the above definition, as follows: if the price is 10/unit or more, I purchase nothing. If it is 7/unit, I'll purchase 3 units. The big point here is that this seems to imply, that I'd pay 7/unit for each of the 3 units. Is that correct? Things would be different if I were faced with a situation in which I had to pay more for the first 2 units. In that case, I might decide to buy less than 3 units. And I wouldn't be contradicting my demand function. At least, not, if it were as I interpreted the definition. Alternative: it seems less close to the text, yet much more convenient to the mathematics, to interpret the demand function in the following way. The demand function answers, for all values of $q$, the question: "if an individual already has $q-1$ units, how much would he be willing to pay for unit $q(p)$?" (or, as an integral, "if an individual already has an amount $q$, how much would $p(q)$ be, with $p(q)dq$ the amount he's willing to pay for an additional amount $dq$?"). Thanks! 

In this balance sheet, the retained earnings (what is taxed) is 8M. With a buyback of 12M in common stock: 

Lowering the price might increase the quantity of gas or petrol sold, but it might not increase the quantity enough relative to the decrease in price. For example, dropping the price by 10% might only increase the amount of gas sold by 5%. Your overall revenue would decrease. 

Since the seasons are swapped between the northern and southern hemispheres, Chilean farms can produce fruits and vegetables to sell to the Americans in the middle of winter. If you live in the States, go to a local supermarket in the middle of winter and look at the fruits. Some of them (for me, I see grapes) are from Chile. Chile also exports fish. It has the longest coastline in the world, and has had some success in fish farming; both of these factors help Chile sell a lot of fish. This is just part of why Chile has been successful (I haven't even mentioned government policy!) but hopefully it'll give you some background on why Chile has been more of a success story than other Latin American nations.

The concept that Brandenburger and Dekel (1987) call an "a posteriori equilibrium" is roughly the same as what Dekel and Siniscalchi call an "epistemic type structure for a complete information game" in which all types are rational and there is common belief in rationality. Therefore, Brandenburger and Dekel's Proposition 2.1, together with the remark that immediately follows the proof of Propoistion 2.1, is roughly the same as Theorem 1 in Dekel and Siniscalchi. 

This looks like a simple first order condition from constrained optimization. If the maximum is interior, i.e. if $t_i>0$, then the first derivative must be zero. If the maximum is on the boundary, i.e. if $t_i=0$, then the first derivative must be $\leq 0$. If it were $>0$, then we can't have an optimum, because then the value of $U$ could be raised by increasing $t_i$. It can be negative, though, assuming that $t_i$ cannot be negative. 

Chile is by far the world's largest producer of copper. Copper is essential for electronics - meaning that Chinese factories have been buying massively - and Chile has been able to use its natural resources to boost its own economy. Copper is also far less volatile in price than oil; prices have only begun to go down because of slowing growth in China. 

Stocks/shares are equity (a share is 'a part of' something) and are thus essential to ownership of a company. Owning shares means that you own part nof a company. The ownership, as a side effect, gives voting rights on the C-suite and dividends. Acquiring a company requires you to buy all of the shares of that company (so that you own it). 

Retained earnings have not changed, the company's taxable income has not changed, and thus the company should not have to pay any taxes. This should be true regardless of where the money 'physically' is - in the U.S. or elsewhere. 

It is difficult to answer your question. The reason is that there is a conceptual problem with the "price of anarchy" literature. The literature uses the sum of utilities, and the ratio of sums of utilities, without reflecting on what it means to sum up utilities, and what it means to divide sums of utilities. In conventional utility theory these are all meaningless operations. Without clearer conceptual foundatinos, it is hard to compare the criterion that the "price of anarchy" literature uses to alternative criteria such as the one that you propose. Maybe one can interpret the welfare criterion in the "price of anarchy" literature as "relative utilitarian." I would have to do some work, though, to figure out whether there is any meaning to dividing welfare from different outomces when welfare is "relative utilitarian." 

Level sets are always well defined. No property of utility functions has to be assumed. For any utility level $\bar u$ just define the level set to be $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^n|U(x)=\bar u\}$. No property of $U$ must be assumed. This is well-defined regardless of the properties of $U$. Properties of $U$ are useful if one wants to derive specific properties of the level sets, but are not needed to define them. 

If you have a pension or own any stocks (hopefully you do), you will have been negatively affected - even though you don't have any 'international' finances. Since the world economy is highly integrated, losses in the UK are correlated with losses in the U.S., Japan, and other world markets. For example, after the news of Brexit broke, the S&P (one of the US stock market indices) fell roughly 100 points. The markets tend to move together (the reason behind this is another question in of itself), so any changes in Britain will affect Americans as well. We're still not sure about the long-term economic effects of this, since we don't know exactly how/when/if the U.K. will exit, but the short-term uncertainty is causing investors to be nervous. British things will be cheaper! The pound fell, meaning that it's cheaper for Americans to buy British things, and more expensive for the British to buy American things. If you wanted to visit the U.K., it's going to be relatively cheap. The simplest effect is that the fall of the pound will positively affect U.S. consumers of British goods, and negatively affect U.S. exporters who export to the U.K.. There may be some effect on your work, but it's impossible for you to know (which is part of the problem. Although your employer may appear to be completely local, it's important to remember that since we're so globalized, there probably will be some effect at your company. For example, one of your company's clients may purchase services from a consultant in the U.K, and this might affect your client, in turn affecting you. It's this kind of domino effect and the uncertainty that Brexit has caused that has so many politicians and economists worried about what might happen. 

In the discussions with Kun it seems we've found a satisfying answer. TL;DR: it is as I suggested in the last paragraph of my question. Long answer: This is becoming a bit of an overkill for a question that could be looked up in a couple of minutes, but it's an interesting exercise to see if we can up with the correct answer ourselves. What are we trying to accomplish again? We have 

The area between the demand curve, $p=5$ and $q=0$, is called the Consumer Surplus CS, and we can calculate it by integration: $$\int_5^\infty Q(p)~\text{d}p=\int_5^{25} (25-p)~\text{d}p$$ This is the same as $$\int_0^{20} (P(q)-5)~\text{d}q=\int_0^{20} \big((25-q)-5\big)~\text{d}q$$ The latter shows the area might be interpreted as the difference between what the consumer is willing to pay and what he is paying -- at least, if our thesis is valid and interpretation (b) holds. We find that the CS in this case is 200. Our thesis can help to interpret this. If the price is 5, the consumer keeps on buying until the additional quantity he could buy does not bring that additional utility of 5. That happens to be at a quantity of 20. Because he was able to buy all units at a price of 5, this represents an advantage: he would have paid more for an additional unit when he still had fewer units. E.g. when he still only had 15 units, he would have paid 10 per unit for additional quantity. Total Willingness To Pay The total willingness to pay TWTP for a quantity $q$ (i.e., the maximum accepted price for that quantity) can be calculated as the sum of the willingness to pay for each subsequent unit until $q$ (i.e., the maximum accepted price per unit for additional units): $$TWTP(q) = \int_0^{q} WTP(q')~\text{d}q'$$ So, in order to calculate how much our buyer would maximally have paid (in total) for those 20 units, we must add the maximum prices for each individual unit. If our thesis is correct and interpretation (b) holds, this is exactly the inverse demand function $P$, so that $$TWTP = \int_0^{20} P(q')~\text{d}q'$$ This Total Willingness To Pay for 20 units happens to be 300 in our case. Now, under normal circumstances the buyer does not need to pay that amount for 20 units, but rather $5\cdot20=100$. The difference between the two is the CS of 200. This is the area above the $p=5$ line, which is what we would expect. Should we have perfect price discrimination, the seller of the good would know the buyer's demand curve, and sell him each unit of the good at exactly the maximum price he'd be willing to pay for it; gradually dropping the price with the buyer's marginal utility: $p=25-q$. That way, the seller is able to capture all of the CS, and the buyer would thus pay 300 for the 20 units. If our thesis is wrong This interpretation only works if our thesis is correct and the inverse demand function $P$ describes the willingness to pay for each additional unit. If it describes the willingness to pay per unit for that and all previous units, i.e. interpretation (a), things are different. In that case, the TWTP for $q$ units is simply the multiplication of $q$ and $P(q)$: $$TWTP(q) = q\cdot P(q)$$ In order to figure out how much would be bought at non-uniform pricing, we need to find the willingness to pay for each unit. That WTP is, as can be seen from the first equation, the derivative of the TWTP, so, in this case: $$WTP(q)=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}q}qP(q)=\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}q}(25q-q^2)=25-2q$$ So, the first quantity is sold at a unit price of 25, just like before. This makes sense, as the buyer does not have any units yet, so the marginal price equals the average price. Then, however, under perfect price discrimination, the price of the good should drop twice as fast as we have previously calculated. That is due to the fact that the additional unit $\text{d}q$, that the seller is trying to sell, does not have a marginal utility given by its price (as is the case in interpretation (b)) but by the increase in total price.1 Moreover, in this situation, the seller sells his last unit for a price of 5, which is when he has sold only 10 units (compared to 20 if interpretation (b) is correct). The buyer has then spent $\int_0^{10} (25-2q)~\text{d}q=150$, which is his TWTP, but for 10 units. This too makes sense: the demand curve prescribes a maximally accepted (average) unit price of 15 - which is exactly what is being paid. What we cannot see anywhere, is the figure of 200 which is the area above the $p=5$ line. In fact, the Consumer Surplus that was 200 in the case of interpretation (b), is actually 0 in the case of interpretation (a) -- simply because of the way the inverse demand function is defined to be the maximum average unit price: if we have a uniform price, the price is the average price, and the buyer will have an incentive to buy more as long as his willingness to pay is higher than the price. Exactly when he buys the quantity $q$ that, on his demand curve, corresponds to the offered price $p$, is the average price he's willing to pay equal to the offered price. Because the average price he's willing to pay, times the quantity, is the total price he's willing to pay for that quantity, and because that also equals the price he is paying at that point in the curve, his CS is 0. Conclusion In order to have a sensible interpretation of the area between the demand curve, $p=5$ and $q=0$, called the Consumer Surplus CS, we need to interpret the inverse demand function to mean: "the price per unit $p$ that the consumer is willing to pay for an additional amount $\text{d}q$, given a possession of $q$ units" (b). The common interpretation (a) as "the price per unit $p$ that the consumer is willing to pay, for each unit, for a the total quantity $q$" is incorrect. It's easy to see, however, why it is often interpreted that way. Firstly, it is a simpler interpretation that's easier to visualise, and secondly, in everyday situations -- which all have uniform pricing -- it still predicts the correct quantity to be traded.
