Here's a pretty amazing example of small scale clearings and manipulation of the forest landscape by indigenous communities. While we're not seeing this from a satellite, it points out how the lack of texture nearby and between these clearings doesn't necessarily mean there's no trails or human presence. It appears these structures are surrounded by unusual tree canopies - perhaps banana or another agroforest crop - which could be cultivated from nearby shelters. 

However, here are a few studies and leads you could explore which try to overcome these challenges in modeling extreme event return intervals and Probable Maximum Precipitation. These seem like they might be addressing your last question but hopefully it helps clarify the potential out there. This one using extreme-value theory: Van Den Brink et al, 2004. Estimating return periods of extreme events from ECMWF seasonal forecast ensembles. 

Otherwise, as folks have explained in comments on the OP, we simply don't have extensive enough observed data that we can rely upon to calibrate these rarer frequency events. I think your last two bullet points sum up our predicament fairly well: 

I am interested in the area draining into and affecting a particular lake. Delineating this drainage basin, should I use the lake's inlet or outlet to best capture the relevant drainage basin? I think including the lake is valuable in this exercise, as events on or in the lake itself also affect the lake. I'd think outlet, but want to double check with you all. To complicate things, most lakes have more than one inlet and outlet. I guess I'd go with the lowest outlet in order to avoid missing any land which may drain into the lake. 

To reiterate: I'm looking for scientific studies and/or diagrams clarifying how do tree roots mitigate pollution? 

This still does not clarify exactly what separates one HUCx from another HUCx downstream of it, both within the same parent HUC? 

Various sources agree land cover changes impact the attenuation of stormwater. E.g. forest areas generally slow the rainfall-runoff response and moderate it, reducing peaks in hydrographs, as compared to urban areas. Is there a way stormwater attenuation can be quantified, by field measurements (eg. observed streamflow) or model outputs? If so, what are some examples of how this can be done? The reason to quantify attenuation would be to compare differences in attenuation between different basins or between different conditions within a basin. 

This one using the growth factor method, or "NERC M5 method", as explained on page 10: Skaugen and FÃ¸rland, 2011. Future change in extreme precipitation estimated in Norwegian catchments. And here is a study which sums the methods up pretty well and proposes a new one for further research, which sounds good to me and relatively like what I described in pretty broad, simple terms in the first part of my answer: Dyrrdal, 2012. Estimation of extreme precipitation in Norway and a summary of the state-of-the-art. There's many quote-worthy passages in this one so I think I'll leave it to you to explore. Sections 3, 4, and 5 are what I imagine you're most interested in because they cover, respectively, the state-of-the-art guidelines/methods from the World Meteorological Organization and various nations; a proposed new-and-improved method; and a conclusion summarize the above. 

Here's one idea to account for meteorological extremes in our climate models, though I'm not sure if it answers your question and am less certain if it qualifies as reliable (open for feedback on that too): Take a regional climate model which has simulated into the past and the future. We also have a few decades of observed data to compare the same time period of simulated past. The observed data is going to capture the extreme events much better in every way of course. So, in projecting into the future, if we want to maintain those extremes, we can use the change factor (based on averages, e.g. monthly means) from past-simulation==>future-simulation in order to project past-observed==>future-predicted. Those future-predictions will have the extreme events as they came in the past but with the changed magnitude based on the climate model's past versus future simulations. This could be applied to meteorological data such as precipitation and other weather variables in order to inform us about the driving weather forces we'll face in future scenarios. In this way our climate models account for meteorological extremes we've observed recently and in the past, which the models may otherwise fall short on. 

One option is NOAA's Climate Data Online service. From that page you can use the Mapping Tool, view Time-Related Maps, and select Hourly/Sub-hourly view. You can then check the Global Hourly dataset to see stations worldwide which have hourly* precipitation data. *This data (Integrated Surface Data or ISD) tends to include less than hourly temporal resolution outside of the U.S. and some major international airports, but you'll still have finer-than-daily resolution in most cases. In terms of spatial resolution, there are many stations included in this service around the world as you'll see - over 20,000 stations with better coverage (and quality data) in some areas than others. Selecting one or more of these stations and downloading their weather data provides a time-series as a digital table. Some examples: text file; web form. You can view metadata for the CDO's Global Hourly data here: $URL$ On that page it states the purpose of this dataset as: 

As I finished writing this question I did find one answer. I'll ask anyway and see if anyone has more info to contribute. From the Wikipedia page on Ice Ages, there's this Timeline of life including a list of ice ages on left side. 

I'm trying to understand transpiration estimation methods. The FAO recommends a standard Penman-Monteith methodology for modeling evapotranspiration based on meteorological and vegetation parameters (ie. wind speed, leaf area index). Many eco-hydrology models make use of the Penman-Monteith equations, some with minor modifications. I understand the Penman-Monteith equations, and modification thereof, are simplifications of complex processes. It would be impractical to measure actual transpiration in all conditions where that information is useful, so we model it instead. That said, field observations in the development or support of models is valuable for verifying knowledge gained through models. My question is: what field studies have developed or supported Penman-Monteith equations (or modified versions of it)? In a sense there is indirect verification of the equations through field measurement verification of results from models that implement the Penman-Monteith equations. Are there any direct field measurements of (evapo-)transpiration that support (or even helped develop) the Penman-Monteith equations, to demonstrate the equations' validity in real world conditions? 

In various atmospheric equations, surface pressure is one of the variables used. For example, in calculating the density of air or pressure-corrected relative optical air mass. How is surface pressure measured? I imagine it's the pressure at the height of a sensor on a weather station. Is that considered effectively pressure at Earth's surface / a good-enough approximation, or do scientists generally adjust measurements from weather stations to be corrected for the height difference between the sensor and Earth's surface? Or is surface pressure measured by a sensor actually at Earth's surface?
