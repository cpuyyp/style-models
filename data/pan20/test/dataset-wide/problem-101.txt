A society truly without religion is deep in fantasy territory, arguably harder to imagine and formulate than extraterrestrial alien societies. Religion is not intrinsically bound up with technology, science, etc., but at the same time it is not intrinsically distinct from these things either. Religious phenomena tend to be recognizable to one's neighbors. Albeit the category "religion" as we know it is a sixteenth-century European invention, some of the most ancient extant texts already reference neighboring peoples as having gods, temples, sacrifices, and so forth, in some cases (notably Egyptian ones) offering translations: "Among the Greeks, Isis is usually known as Aphrodite, and is offered the following sacrifices...." 

What’s the difference? The scientist has not in fact “explained.” He has assumed that, in the absence of definite evidence to the contrary, there is no determinate connection between the forces that caused the granary to fall and the fact that Uncle Herman happened to be sleeping where he was. But that is an assumption, based on a complex system of logical investigation, accepted practice, and so forth. The magician, however, refuses to accept this. He lives in a purely clockwork universe, as it were. It is simply not possible that there is no determinate cause of Herman’s death. “Random” means nothing—it’s a dodge to avoid having to explain anything. Result If we accept that both aspects of the proposal are valid, then we have a field in which scientific investigation is essentially pointless. On the one hand, experimentation doesn’t work well, because you can’t isolate the variables. To investigate fire spells, for instance, you can either study how Magical Mandy does them, which is at least consistent, or else study how lots of magicians do them, which has statistical value. Unfortunately, the first study is statistically meaningless, because you can’t compare to any other cases, while the second produces completely inconsistent results (two magicians use paint, the other 98 don’t; two different magicians yell words that have Z’s in them, the other 98 don’t; and so forth). On the other hand, these magicians seem to infer and manipulate causal mechanisms that simply aren’t there. The diviner, let’s say, can with 100% accuracy tell you what’s on the back of a card or whatever, and double-blind tests confirm this. So what do you learn? Nothing, because he says it’s obvious that this card is the Queen of Hearts because of the pattern he saw in his breakfast cereal this morning, and so far as anyone can tell, he’s telling the truth as he sees it. To him, the world is tied up with all kinds of weird forces, and he can “prove” their reality through this kind of divination, but they don’t respond to any other kinds of tests. They’re just not there. So when you do big statistical studies, the odd magician will stick out like a sore thumb, because normal probability just doesn’t work the same for him. Ultimately, nobody in the science business is going to waste time and money on this nonsense. It’s real, sure, but it doesn’t mean anything. There’s nothing to be learned from it. You can’t build anything with it. If you involve real magicians in any kind of testing, stuff goes haywire, causing damage and expense. So let’s just ignore them. Yes, in theory you could study these effects, but what for? What sort of nut is going to waste his life trying to figure out why Magical Mandy sucks cough-drops after casting spells? And for sure, nobody’s going to fund his experiments. Q.E.D. 

One point to bear in mind is that science—here specifically the Western-style science that developed over the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries—has traditionally had a lot of trouble being qualitative. It is very good at quantitative; in fact, quantification is generally considered one of the principal founding developments for the scientific revolution. Magic, in your construction, is intrinsically qualitative. And because it is so subjective, it can be irritatingly difficult to quantify. So there’s a balance there. Now as for what magic might contribute to science, the first place to look is where the qualitative might be of value but is currently difficult or impossible. Total Determinism Back in the early 1960s, Claude Levi-Strauss argued that magic differs from science in part because magic is more deterministic than science, contrary to what one might think. Let’s suppose there is a high wind one day, and the granary tips over and falls, killing my uncle Herman. Now the scientist goes to explain this incident, and he points to termites, high winds, dry rot, and so forth. But the magical thinker says, “I know all that—I'm not stupid—but that doesn’t fully answer the question. Why did it fall on Herman?” For the scientist, this is not an answerable question—bad luck, in essence. But for the magician, it is the very essence of the issue. In other words, a magical perspective assumes that there is no such thing as a purely random event, provided that the event in question has meaning. For the scientist, the non-qualitative approach means that he cannot determine whether an event does or does not have meaning—it happened, and that’s all. For the magician, a proper understanding of a phenomenon requires that it be located within a larger framework of meaning. Meaning and Manipulation One interesting implication, in a world where magic indubitably works, is that the magician is above all a master of meaning. She looks at the world as a complex web of intersecting meaningful elements. To understand a phenomenon, she tries to grasp how it is situated within that total web. To change something—to perform magic—she manipulates the web by focusing on elements that relate appropriately. In some cases, she does this more or less by rote: the following procedure always works, but you have to be clear on the exact astrological situation relative to the place and time where you’re doing it, and because I’m me and you’re you, there are elements I use that you don’t and the reverse. In some cases, however, perhaps especially with magical masters, rote procedures won’t do. So the master needs to construct a new total structure, building from existing elements. Now the reason I bring this latter point up is that it actually alters the universe. If magic really works like this, then each time a magician creates a new procedure this way, the total web of meaning alters: new connections are forged, for example. But now that they have been forged, they’re part of the total web of meaning. This is why a spell that was insanely difficult 500 years ago is now done by first-year apprentices: if everyone keeps doing it, the connections get stronger and easier to manipulate. You might say there is a kind of momentum to magical effects. How does this affect the scientist? Well, for one thing, the universe he’s studying isn’t entirely stable. That’s going to be irritating. But you’ve said that science basically works just fine. This suggests that the web of connections that the magicians manipulate are something that stands over and above the physical connections and laws studied by science. And this means that the magician has quite a lot to offer the scientist. Such As 

Line up your 12 zodiac signs with the proposed rough calendar. You may wish to tweak this or that sign to fit well with the relevant season, but since that’s not the case on earth, it may be best to leave the list apparently incoherent to the seasons. One more choice: 

The setup for this is complex, so I'll begin by stating the core question: In a heavy ship engagement, using energy-dissipation armor, about how much warmer will the sea get, and will that have any gross effects? Background In the late 1700s, as the Age of Sail is at its height (and getting close to its collapse), things are pretty much as you’d expect…except, of course, for the use of magic, principally defensive. It comes in many forms, and can have a number of effects, but for purposes of the present question, I want to focus on the following system of armor: 

transitions the subject(s) from State A to State B by way of a sharply-delimited liminal phase during which phase certain culturally-important norms and ideals are presented strongly for free consideration and interpretation by those to whom they are presented with the constraint that interpretation must ultimately reinforce the social norms and ideals Furthermore, the symbolism of transition from A to liminal is commonly that of death (one dies to State A) the symbolism of transition from liminal to B is commonly that of birth (one is reborn into State B) 

"Here at home" in most of these civilizations, a "given" deity would manifest in different ways and with different local practices in different places. For example, worship of Athena in Athens worked differently than in Sparta. How "foreigners" thought of Athena might be considerably stranger, but people were used to the idea of highly particular cults. Local rulers might embrace a "when in Rome" sort of policy: while you are here in Ur, you worship Ishtar our way, because she (whom you know as Isis) prefers worship here in that fashion. Rulers might alternatively embrace the alternative: while you Egyptians are here, you may worship Isis in your preferred fashion, so long as you do not interfere with our worship of Ishtar, and so long as the demands of your cult do not infringe upon our laws.
