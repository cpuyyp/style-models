The idea of the hole is to allegedly relieve pressure in the groin area. Works for some people, but depending on the shape of your groin, the edges of the hole can put more pressure on the groin. Part of this is due to hysteria to alleged impotency of riding a bike, and part of it due to it being more comfortable for some people. As for MTB vs Road, there exist plenty of saddles which have this feature of both types -- the distinction between MTB and Road saddles is primarily for marketing, though the MTB saddles may be built a bit tougher (e.g. rails or something). The important thing is to have one that fits. 

Single speeds are nice, but if you're not fit, you're going to be putting in a lot more effort to get up to speed than a geared bike with lower gearing (you have to compromise with a higher starting gear so you have decent cruising). I'd go geared. Make sure to budget for accessories, like helmet, lock, lights. At 240 pounds, you're close to the limit on some bikes (though they're likely bikes you should avoid - all the bikes I mentioned are designed to take at least 300 lbs AFAIK, but check this out), so make sure to check the manufacturer recommended weights. Avoid fancy racing frames which are designed to be super light, and get some decent sized tires (maybe 700c x 38 or so) to decrease the likelihood of road hazards causing problems and increase comfort. 

I'd avoid doing this. Basically, you do a light (typically wet) sanding by hand (very carefully), prime it with an appropriate primer (maybe a few times) and then paint over it with an appropriate color. However, since the sanding has to be done carefully (since its easy to destroy carbon fiber by sanding), you're going to end up paying someone a lot of money to do this (since it takes a lot of time to prep the frame). You can't really use chemical strippers or other techniques that you'd apply for aluminum and steel frames can destroy the carbon fiber. You also can't do things like powder coating for the paint step, since you have to heat the frame to the point where the carbon fiber can be destroyed. If you're really insistent on doing this, there are shops which specialize in repainting carbon fiber. But, they'll charge you an arm and a leg due to the amount of labor they'll have to put in to prep the frame for repainting. 

According to $URL$ your bike has direct pull (a.k.a V-brakes). Your brake shoes should have threaded studs with spherical washers. There isn't really a point in getting a set with a holder given how often brakes on a folder would have to be replaced and the price difference, but Kool Stop does make V brake refills and holders. You need the Kool Stop Mountain (a.k.a bmx) threaded salmon's or threaded thinlines ($URL$ or $URL$ The ones you linked will not fit (they are for caliper brakes). The threaded thinlines may be a better option since they give a bit more room (they're a bit thinner). Since you asked this question, some help with installing the brake pads may be useful: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ (And the back of the package the brakes come from) 

No. Generally, you need to know the manufacturer at least and then see if theres some code for their serial numbers. 

The hard and fast rule is to do whatever it takes to keeps you safe. The first thing is to ride with lights at night and reflective gear. Generally, what I do is, if theres a wide enough shoulder I will use it. If there isn't, I take the lane. Being in a corner of a lane is a problem since motorists will try to sneak past and can't always judge the room needed to do so safely (at least a 3 foot margin from you). The side of the road is generally bad as debris tends to collect there, so you increase your risk of punctures and what not. Note that there may be legal things to do -- The Washington state bicycling guide says cyclists must be as far right as it is safe not as far right as is possible (my personal policy also follows this). Check with your local area to see what the legal policy is (if any). To quote the Washington state bicycling guide: "Washington State law requires cyclists to ride as far to the right as is safe, not as far to the right as is possible. There is a crucial difference. Assess the situation to decide how far towards the center of the lane you need to travel to be safe versus unduly delaying motorized traffic. Taking the full lane is generally safest when traveling for short stretches on lower speed roads (20-25mph). On higher speed roads, it may be safer to reduce your speed and stay further to the right rather than compete with faster vehicles for the full lane. You may find it necessary to take the lane in the following kinds of situations: • when traveling at traffic speed and you need to prevent motorists from inadvertently cutting you off; • when descending a hill and you need extra space (for reaction time) due to your speed; • when lane width does not permit a motorized vehicle behind you to safely pass; • when road conditions (potholes, road debris or parked cars) preclude you from riding farther to the right. Be aware that many motorists neither understand that you have the right to take the lane in these situations (or at all), nor may they see road condition hazards which you are trying to avoid." Another thing to note is that part of safety (aside from abiding from the law) is dealing with harassment. From the same guide: "Most motorists are courteous and happy to share the road with cyclists, but unfortunately, the small minority of drivers who are rude or threatening stand out. Harassment can make a commute unenjoyable or even dangerous. Fortunately, it rarely occurs. If harassed, try to keep your cool and remember that your safety is the priority. You will rarely convince an irate motorist to share the road, and besides, you don’t want to provoke a person unstable enough to harass you in the first place. Your best bet is to develop your riding skills, know your rights, ride legally and try to keep calm in the event you are harassed. Noting a car’s license plate, description and occupants may help when reporting an incident to the authorities." 

According to French wikipedia, automatic pedals seem to be clipless pedals. A wide range of manufacturers make waterproof shoe covers (also known as overshoes or booties), for use with both clipless pedal systems as well as your usual set of sneakers (be sure to check out the particular model to see if they're compatible. One designed solely for clipless pedals may be too small for your regular shoes unless you just wear Chucks. Ones which can be used for regular shoes are often marked to work with mountain bike shoes and leisure shoes). They just go over your shoes, and look something like this (not endorsing this particular model necessarily): 

There are companies which service forks (like the Shock Treatment Center at QBP). Chances are your local bike shop has an account with QBP and might be able to arrange something to get it fixed, provided QBP services Headshok forks (if not, another non-Cannondale company might). Of course, the reason why your fork went bad may have something to do with servicing it / preventing it from going bad further, and given how old this bike is, they might (probably) won't service this fork. But you might find a different company that does service old Headshok forks. As for replacing a Headshok (or Lefty for that matter, I think), you'll need a Problem Solvers Headtube Reducer for Headshok forks which will convert Headshok to 1 1/8". You can read the instructions, but basically, you pull out the Headshok, remove the bearings, press in the reducer and then install your headset and fork. Other manufacturers also make parts for converting from Headshok to 1 1/8" (e.g. Cane Creek's Double Xc). You'll need a shop to install the Problem Solvers reducer (or other manufacturer's options), since it requires a bearing press (which home mechanics don't have; its about a 150 dollar tool that you will probably use once in your life). So, while they're at it, they should be able to set you up with a compatible fork (by measuring axle to crown and what your other needs are) and everything else. All that being said, this bike is close to 20 years old (maybe a bit more, maybe a bit less) -- the parts you need and labor will likely make it more favorable to buy a different bike; before the fork, you may be spending 50-100 bucks on the parts to get a standard fork to fit in the first place. I'd probably bet that a basic hard tail today would be better across the board than a 20 year old full suspension bike, too. 

This one mounts to the caliper bridge and can use a quick release on the bottom. However, since my bike has horizontal dropouts, I am not sure if there is anything else I need to be aware of for using a quick release mounted rack. Typically the rack will be loaded with 5-20 kg. The skewer is an old Shimano one, probably the original one which came with the 105 hubs. 

By the time you get the bike looking similar to the latter, you'd be better off buying the latter. The fork controls part of the geometry and changing the fork will make it different. Also, you need access to tools for replacing the fork (lets leave aside the different types of headsets for now, since that is part of the aesthetic). Then, you need to buy a flat bar instead of the swept back bars you have now. This is trivial to replace. You can use the existing brake levers, but if you want to match style, you can buy some new modern levers for pretty cheap. A new saddle isn't too expensive, i suppose either. The new wheels alone will probably run you over 200 dollars anyway since they're hipster-y. It looks like these Aristotle bicycles retail for around 400 dollars. Given that a new fork is probably going to run at least 50-60 dollars, a new wheelset 200 dollars, a new riser bar 20 dollars, saddle probably 30-40 bucks, you're going to run probably more than the new bike costs. Thats also excluding the time + tools you may need to buy/borrow + paint and the bicycle you want to "restore" (plus, some hipster would likely find that bike attractive as it is). And given that that bike looks like its not in America, note that these fixed/single speed bikes with flip flop hubs which look like the Aristotle bike are pretty damn common now among the hipsters - it shouldn't be hard to find a new one under the price of doing this conversion in Europe.

Assuming the shifter and derailleur have compatible cable pulls (which you should check), you won't be able to perfectly adjust the shifter to shift smoothly on a cassette of 7, since the cable pull which moves the shifter for 8 speeds is likely not enough for 7 speeds. Thus, generally, you need to match the shifters with the derailleur and the cassette spacing. Sheldon Brown has some comments on 7 speed setups and running an 8 speed shifter with 7 speeds through some alternate cable routing, but given that you can buy an 8 speed cassette for like 10 bucks, it seems like an unnecessary hassle (given the extra time you'll be spending tweaking adjustment). Or you can bolt on a 5 buck friction shifter and save yourself some time too. 

I'd recommend learning to do arm signals. Arm signals don't run out of batteries, and are plenty visible in most cases. They're certainly bigger than the turn signal lights you could put on a bicycle (which as Moz points out in a comment, makes distinguishing the 2 turn signals a possible issue), and the distance you need to see a bike turning is a lot smaller than that which you need to see a car turning.You also have to worry about running wires from the back to front if you only have one power source (and the indicator switch isn't wireless) and worry about bags or other things obscuring the lights. Your handlebar area also becomes a bit more cluttered for a turn signal anyway, esp if you have trigger shifters. And you have to deal with the potential of the lights getting stolen. At night, the primary value would be moreso the extra light rather than the fact that it was a turn signal light, and you can get that just by putting on a bigger head and tail light. You'll get used to balancing while doing them after a few weeks of riding, typically. And in any case, you need to know how to do them when your batteries run out. IMO, the primary use of turn signals on a bike is less-so that you know which way a turn is happening, but moreso that the drivers know the cyclist is going to do something and be prepared for it (a sentiment echoed by one of the comments). 

I'm going to guess that the wheel slipped in the dropouts (where the wheel's axle enters the frame). Loosen the nuts that hold the wheel's axle in the frame. Push the wheel back into the dropouts all the way (depending on the frame, you might not do all the way; the wheel should be sufficiently in the dropouts). Check that the wheel is centered. Then, tighten the nuts. 

The bike would sit about 4 mm lower is the main thing (and technically, the gearing will change slightly). You can mount the tire on there and it will work, but it may not be optimal depending on your rim width; if the rim is too wide for the tire, you may get more flats or rim damage when you hit a road hazard. As for why you want to switch to something slimmer, if its for rolling resistance, you should read this and this. 

So, if you want to make it easier for a given bike to go up a hill, fit a cassette/freewheel with bigger gears, and use smaller chainrings in the front. Note that lower gearing means that your top speed won't be that high. When descending a hill, you also have two things: - Bike geometry and bike fit: The position of you on the bike and the geometry will determine the stability and control you have when descending. - Brakes: Brakes are the way you'll primarily stop. If its a big descent, you have to be careful not to overheat the brakes/rims, so you need to choose appropriate brakes (this includes pads, calipers, etc.) that provide the right level of braking for the weather/terrain and modulate them appropriately (e.g. if you go down a long hill and just hold the brake partially on, you may boil your brake fluid on a hydraulic brake, just like you would on a car). Your gearing won't necessarily matter all that much on a bike with a freewheeling mechanism, since you'll either have a gear that you can accelerate with or you'll be freewheeling (and if you want to accelerate, you'll want to add combinations of higher gears (large chainring, small cog in the back)). Tires: For road use (on a clean/wet road), you want smooth tires. Knobbies increase resistance on a road, plus when cornering at high speed can flex and lead to wiping out. Also set your tire pressures correctly (this is important for comfort and control). Off-road or snow will favor some form of knobbies. As for tire sizing, note that it does affect the standover height a bit, but this is a personal preference determined by how much you weigh, how much comfort you want (bigger tires at lower pressure are more comfortable), how well the tire stands up to cornering (which is determined by how flexible the tire is as well as the pressures its run and its size -- a big low pressure tire may flop off at a high speed corner when a thin high pressure tire wouldn't), puncture protection, rolling resistance at a given inflation pressure among other things. Note that you don't want to run a very wide tire on a very narrow rim and vice versa due to the tire coming off or hazards damaging the rim. Unless you're riding on a road and you have knobby tires, I'd probably start with finding appropriate gearing (by swapping freewheels/cassettes so you have a big enough big cogs for the uphills and small enough small cogs for the downhills) and making sure brakes are up to snuff (probably starting with having good brake pads and the brakes are in adjustment). If you are riding on a road and have knobby tires, buy some slicks.
