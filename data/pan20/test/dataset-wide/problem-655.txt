I know nothing is thief proof, but some systems are more of a deterrent than others. Looking for recommendations for good systems. Perhaps more importantly I'd like to hear about systems found to be insecure (i.e. can be broken with a bic pen level of technology). And, does anyone use a special seat bolt (the one right under the seat that is used to lock fore-aft)? I know a keyed seat post bolt can be sidestepped simply removing the seat top - is that a common target, just the top of the seat without the post and platform? 

Notice I am assuming the size of the frame and height of the rider is fixed here, so I am only talking about the lenght of the seatpost that's hidden inside the frame. The only thing I could think about is that a longer seatpost is subject to less torque. 

I am about to buy a new seatpost and I am wondering what's the ideal length. The one I have now is 33cm long, even though it only sticks out of 10cm from the frame (measured from the seat collar to the saddle rail). Because of that, I thought a 25cm seatpost would be a better match and I would save in weight. The question is: 

Jagwire makes some cable housings that look like braided metal (called "sterling silver", "titanium", "carbon silver", and "gold"). I have a vague recollection of a review that said these metallic housings are more difficult to cut than the solid colored ones. Can anyone confirm or deny this? (I have a decent bicycle cable/housing cutter that worked fine on the solid colored Jagwire housings.) 

I currently have traditional drop bars and cross (interrupter) brake levers. I like the interrupters and use them a lot. But I'm going to get a compact drop bar (FSA Omega Compact bar on order), and in trying to envision this new setup, it seems the interrupters might be less useful with compact bars because my hands, even on the cross bar, will be closer to the (regular) brakes. Plus the "cockpit" area, being more compact with compact bars, might be overly cluttered with interrupters in there. Plus with a compact bar I suspect I'll have my hands on the cross bar less of the time. All in all it seems interrupter brakes are less desirable on a compact drop bar than they are on a traditional drop bar. Does anyone use interrupter brake levers on a compact bar? 

On the website of a wheel manifacturer, I can find the following specs about the cog compatibility of their track wheels: 

I bought a riser bar (Easton EA30) and I want to buy grips and brake levers to put on it. I know the clamp diameter is 31.8mm, but how do I figure out the bar end diameter? I don't have a caliper to measure it and it's not written anywhere (box, instructions manual, ...). As suggested by one of the answer, the grip size is likely going to be 22.2 What makes me not sure is the fact that Easton (the same manifacturer of the bar) only sells grips of size 30 and 33 (Ref: $URL$ 

The easiest thing to try is to throw another layer of tape on there. Of course most of this detracts from the classic looks of your bike. 

I'm going to be re-taping my bars for the first time soon, and I was thinking about a putting an extra layer of tape for just slightly increased diameter and padding. I have big hands, but I don't want the padding kits that are available, as I think that might be too much. Is this under-taping at all common? I was thinking about using cloth medical-style tape. Would this be a good choice? (I don't race, just exercise/commute/day-trip, will be getting compact drop-bars) 

I have bought some generic cable housing without paying attention to the specification ($URL$ It comes with a set of ferrules and I didn't know those have a size as well (mines are 5mm according to the link above). The ferrule fits very well into my lever (a bar short-pull straight bar lever), but it doesn't fit on the brake housing slot (see picture below). The brake is a Shimano 105 5800, but I can't find anywhere a mention of the size of the housing slot. (I tried to look even in the dealer's manual.) What's the standard size for the cable housing slot of modern road caliper brakes? If I go with a cable housing (and ferrules) with smaller diameter, am I going to have issue on the lever side? (It fits perfectly now). 

At the beginning of this video: $URL$ it looks like this bike messenger has an extra strap for his bag that comes up under his left arm to stabilize his load. Looks pretty neat, like it can be easily unsnapped to get the normal messenger bag access, and possibly be DIY-able. 

Those long "mountain bike" Kool-stops work fine on my modern skinny wheel road bike with side-pull calipers. If the modern Kool-stops fit (and don't see why not), I'm sure they will outperform those vintage looking ones - the contact area is much greater. I'd even bet the long contact patch results in less torque on the caliper arms, but I doubt it's an issue either way. Those Kool-stops are nice, the mounting hardware allows fine adjustment of the plane of the brake surface. You're supposed to adjust them with a little toe-in (toe-out?) so the inevitable torque when applied straightens them out (we're talking a very small amount of inevitable torque twist - but the Kool-stops are designed to account for that). That little bend on the tip of the red side helps with the setup for that. Take the bike in and ask the bike shop, but my guess is they'll work fine on 60s era calipers/skinny wheels. 

In a previous question, I have been told that the grip diameter of a MTB riser bar is 22.2mm. From research I did, the grip diameter of BMX handlebars is also 22.2mm. In fact, it's possible to use BMX grips on MTB handlebars. I thought this would allow to use also BMX bar plugs on MTB riser bars. As I experienced first hand, this is not the case, see picture below. Is that because the internal diameter of MTB bars is smaller than in BMX bars? 

from $URL$ However, in most other cases, the compatibility is not specified. Should I assume 7x9 is compatible by default with any seatpost or not? Edit Follow-up Note: I happened to notice that some manifacturers offer the options of clamps for different size of rails, this is from the Thomson page, for example: This seems to suggest that there is some difference between the clamps I have to pick. 

If you had 35mm tires (Schwalbe marathon supremes to be specific) would you get innertubes speced as 28-35mm or 35-42mm? Or whichever is cheaper? 

I'm 53 and for the past year have been pushing it slightly. Have always been careful to not push it too hard, but yesterday I got a mild pull in my right hamstring. Just a slight soreness right behind the knee. Can I keep riding, 5-10 miles a day, at an easier pace without worsening it, or should I stop riding until I can't feel it?
