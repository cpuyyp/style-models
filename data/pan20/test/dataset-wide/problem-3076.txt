The helmsman is located well back of the mast itself, so it obscures little of his vision. The big sail is in the helmsman's face only when the vessel is running downwind. at all other points of sail the sail themselves are well to leeward of the vessel's centre-line. 

When will this myth dies its long deserved death? It is based on the blind following of Sir Charles Oman's mistaken interpretation of French tactics, arising from a misunderstanding of contemporary accounts of the Battle of Maida. You all need to read A Reappraisal of Column Versus Line in the Peninsular War by James Arnold. The true French battle formation in the Napoleonic Wars was skirmish order, and it is with its disciplined artillery and hordes of skirmishers that the French pummelled the lines of Austrian, Prussian and Russian troops for 20 years, softening them up for a hammer blow by reserve infantry and heavy cavalry that would punch a hole through the lines and unleash a torrent of pursuit by the likes of LaSalle and Montbrun. It is noteworthy that the only other nation to train and deploy skirmishers in similar quantity and quality to the French was the British under Wellington. The Column, whether by company or division, was a maneuver formation, which wheeled and formed (hollow) square up to 3 times faster than a line (French regulations of 1791 gave respectively 30 sec. and 100 sec. for forming square). In emergency a masse or closed-column square could often be formed even faster to defend against cavalry, a maneuver favoured by the Austrians, Prussians and Russians from their experience against the nomadic horsemen of the steppe. For the bulk of Napoleonic battles in which they fought the French were the attacker, and hence maneuvered in column prior to deploying and giving combat. Those on the defence, without the requirement to maneuver, have the luxury of waiting in line for the assault. As noted in James Arnold's series the intent was always to deploy into line before contact (except as a coup de main), though this sometimes failed in execution. Update - Excerpts from A Reappraisal of Column versus Line in the Peninsular War by James R. Arnold's: Part 1: - Introduction - 

In 1870-1, the most comprehensive outline for Modern Rules of War was that formulated by Francis Lieber in 1863 (the Lieber Code, Section IV), and commissioned by President Lincoln, unilaterally directed for the conduct of Union Armies. Our modern, stricter, guidelines for conduct of war between civilized nations only begins a generation after 1870-1, with the series of International Hague and Geneva Conventions that began in 1899. Lieber attempts to clearly formulate the distinction between partisans - public enemies entitled to the full protection as prisoners of war when captured - and any other miscellaneous brigands and prowlers who were NOT public enemies and thus NOT entitled to such protections. 

That's three of the seven days with a serious issue on the claimed equivalence. The Sun and Moon are often seen as celestial book-ends, so putting them at the start and end of the week may simply be an extension of that. I don't see any need to invoke more human rationalization for the other claimed equivalences. 

This combines to ensure that Menzie's broadcast declaration above (of Australia being at war with Nazi Germany) was not impeached by the retro-active application of the Westminster Adoption Act 1942. 

You will have a difficult time convincing me that Napoleon was the best battlefield technician of all time, when he was (at best!) only the third most expert French practitioner of that art during the Napoleonic Era; Davout and likely Desaix would head that list, and all of Soult, Lannes and Massena can at least be argued as more expert than Napoleon). Similarly as a dynastic founder Napoleon's complete ineptitude at diplomacy place him a long ways down that list. While Napoleon's construction and use of the Imperial Guard, and Artillery Reserve were masterful, most of French tactical doctrine and organization was already in place as the result of events leading up to Valmy. He would certainly have to place behind Alexander (or Philip if you prefer), Marius, and Temujin among architects of the military force they wielded. As an innovator of tactics and strategies Napoleon is unexceptional, making use of the tools available in marginally more productive ways. Of his well published developments only the Battallione Carre is truly novel. Where Napoleon did excel was as a charismatic leader of men. He was able to surround himself with an array of extremely talented subordinates who often despised, and would refuse to cooperate with, each other; bind them to himself with exceptional loyalty; and energize them to attain heights even they did not believe them selves capable of. 

Note that there is a natural limit to how long a whiskey can be barrel-aged, depending on the initially available. There is a slow evaporation through the oak barrel, requiring regularly refilling of some barrels from others. Once the level in the last barrel drops below the refill threshold it must be decanted into successively smaller barrels, with any remainder consumed (I volunteer for barrel refilling!), until the volume drops below that of the smallest practical barrel. Update 2: 

So it seems that World War 2 (or variantly The Second World War) was always called by those names, at least in English speaking countries. The former seems the dominant usage in North America, and the second dominatn in the United Kingdom. In Russia, the war has (I believe) always been called The Great Patriotic War, at least in regards to after the invasion of the Soviet Union by the Germans on June 22, 1941. 

At a very high level economic systems can be classified into 4 groups by two criteria: public or private ownership, and central or decentralized control. Capitalism as commonly practiced in English-speaking democracies is typically private ownership with decentralized control. Capitalism as typically practiced in European democracies has private ownership with a significantly greater degree of central control, though still more decentralized than not. Communism as practiced in the USSR (and its satellites) and China until abut 1990 was strictly public ownership with central control. Since then China has tempered both somewhat, while retaining the broad classification. Communism as practiced in Tito's Yugoslavia was considerably less centralized than in either the USSR or China. Fascism as practiced in Germany and Italy from 1920 to 1945 had private ownership with central control. Of course this classification is the view from 30,000 feet so to speak. Many variations exist between countries, and over time as laws and regulations change. Where and how to draw the distinguishing line for each criteria is more a matter of opinion than not. Any deep analysis requires a detailed examination of the specific legal and regulatory framework, and practice, of a specific jurisdiction over a specific time period. 

As a start on a more comprehensive answer to this question, let's begin with some good source material available online. This paper from the United States Naval Academy looks at the distinction between "hired soldiers" and "soldiers for hire" in the period 400 to roughly 1066 AD in Britain. It covers, amongst other issues, (some of) the origins of our instinctual disregard for mercenaries in the relationship between Celtic and Anglo-Saxon employers of mercenaries, and the mercenary soldiers employed by them prior to the Norman conquest. Military Organization of Society, at least in the 80 or so pages available for free preview, looks more generally at the parallel development of our modern society and the modern army, in Europe from about 1000 AD to the present. Finally, this online article looks in some detail, slightly romanticized, at key concepts in Medieval Warfare including the recruiting, pay, and organization of both mercenary and other troops. Dozens of books, articles and offprints can be found on the famous Italian Condottierri in even the most cursory Google search. Best known for the staged bloodless battles of their later days, they originated as true mercenaries rather than fantastic stage troupes (sic). As this article above notes in the section on Pay For The Troops: 

Empirically, it seems that there were two degrees of conviction on Count IV: with and without extenuating circumstance: 

Note that Crown Prince is a colloquial (and descriptive) term, not a proper title. The phrase Heir Apparent likewise is simply a descriptive term rather than a title. The official title for various European royal heirs are: 

Let's do the math: 100,000 mounted archers * 4 horses each * 10 kg/day * 250 days/campaign = 1,000,000,000 kg of forage required each campaign. As noted here annual forage yield of meadow steppe is about 2000 kg/ha; of typical steppe about 900 kg/ha; and even desert steppe yields 200 kg/ha. Thus the area required to support Genghis's cavalry for a campaign ranges between 500,000 to 1,000,000 ha, or 5,000 to 10,000 km^2. A single day's forage could be found in an area of 20 to 40 km^2, which seems quite a reasonable campground size for an army of 100,000 cavalrymen. Of course, given this forage requirement, it is no surprise that Genghis's army moved so rapidly - if it didn't it was going to starve. ;-) Update: Genghis's army rode ponies, not full horses, reducing forage needs accordingly. Update 2: Let me rephrase - The Mongols (and other steppe peoples such as Manchus and Turks) rode breeds of horse that average a bit under the modern 14 hands height limit for a pony. Let's say typically 13 to 15 hands. This is about one hand shorter than the height of a typical riding horse, of 14 to 16 hands. As fuel requirement generally goes as the cube of height, ceteris paribus, a horse/pony only 14/15 as high would require about 20% less feed. Make it 15% less to allow for cooler temperatures and a consequently faster metabolism for the breed. 

Those sections where the gradient is only 1:20,000, or 1m in 20km, are deliberate not accidental, designed to allow the Pont du Gard section to be considerably lower, and easier to build, than would have been required by an even gradient. Further note that while the isthmus of Hadrian's Wall is only 118km long, contemporaneously Roman Engineers were undertaking the building of a 170km tunnel aqueduct, the Gadra Aqueduct, to supply the city of Gadra in Jordan with water. In summary, the Romans were excellent engineers and knew well how to design and survey large tracts and structures. It is faulty reasoning to assume that the absence of modern technology made such feats impossible. Note also, from this outline of ancient measuring devices: 

The list can be found in the original Latin on page 68 of this edition of the Ystoria Mongolarum, about 1/3 of the way down the page. On Page 269 (through 295) are C. Raymond Beazley's Notes on Hakluyt's Version of Vincent of Beauvis' Abridgement of Carpini, discussing the text. On Page 278 at the top we have a discussion of India magna (noting that India in this context likely meant everything from Kabul to Saigon, our Indies): as that part of India between the Indus and Ganges rivers, so roughly corresponding to the modern country of India. Further India would at his time have referred to the territories east of, or beyond, the Ganges, and so to our modern Indo-China, the countries of Burma, Siam, Laos, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam. Lesser India would have been the territories west of the Indus River, or roughly modern Pakistan and Afghanistan. Simply perusing the text I recognize the Kytai and Naymani as Mongol tribes (nations) subjugated by Temujin very early on. The Merkiti may also fall in this category. 

Following the First World War the Middle East was divvied up between the French and British under the Sykes-Picot Agreement. At this time it was expected that oil would be fond near Mosul in Iraq, although no exploration had yet been done to confirm this. In expectation of oil being found there, the French and British reached an agreement (in the Sykes Picot Agreement) on how to share said oil. In further expectation of building a pipeline from Mosul to the port at Haifa, and as majority owner of said oil, the British drew the borders of both Iraq and Transjordan so as to ensure that the Mosul-Haifa pipeline ran exclusively over British controlled mandates/Protectorates. The North-Eastern border of Jordan (then the Emirate of Transjordan) and the North-Western border of Iraq were drawn out to join. 

Additionally Stephen of Blois, soon to be King of England, attempted to kidnap his cousin (the future Empress) Matilda after being exchanged by Matilda for her half-brother Robert of Gloucester following her successful kidnap of Stephen. That makes Stephen a successfully kidnapped prince (Are you listening, Paper Bag Princess?) and Matilda an unsuccessfully kidnapped princess. I don't know if there was an attempt by either to marry the other.
