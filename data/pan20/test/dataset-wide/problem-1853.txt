There are a million different reasons why even the same type of people (same sex, race, experience, education) get different salaries. It could be anything - one skill that you have that no one else has, the time you were hired being a time when they couldn't find anyone and had to up their offer to get candidates, the hiring manager just seems to like you, etc, etc. There are literally hundreds of reasons why salaries differ. I've had plenty of jobs where the salaries people were paid made no sense - there just seems to be no rhyme or reason. That being said, it is ethical for a company to pay someone more when that someone is something (whatever it is) that the company sees value in? I don't think so. If all of your co-workers were exactly the same as you in every way but you got paid more and your employer said they are paying you more simply because they thought you'd be a perfect fit and really wanted to hire you - would you question that? A company is allowed to pay anyone anything they like if they think it is worth it. If they were paying you less just because you are a woman (which I'm sure happens), I would consider that ethically wrong. 

First of all, I can't believe that you're even contemplating taking an offer that is only marginally better for an extra 2 hours of driving each day (assuming 1.5 hours vs. 30 min)... you'll eat up that extra 5k in gas and wear and tear on your car (assuming you're driving) - not to mention the extra 10 hours per week wasted on traveling. That being said, they both sound like decent offers and I believe that you should just take whichever one you want the most. Too many people seem preoccupied with "burning bridges". Will you "burn a bridge"? It depends. In a few years will the same people even work at that company and will they remember you? Who knows? As far as I know, no company keeps a list of "those a-holes that screwed us over". And if they're really in need and they do indeed remember you as someone who "started a small fire on a river-crossing" one time... they'll most likely hire you anyway. But most likely I don't think that you'll burn a bridge anyway. I don't think those people really know you well enough to hold a grudge like that. People tend to do stuff like this all the time in business these days, especially in fields that are in high-demand where qualified people are in short demand. If anything, they may just shrug and say to each other "we lost another one". 

I never had the issue of not having much to do as a junior developer. I always seemed to get thrown in the deep end forced to swim. I can't say that its good or bad either way, but I think you learn more when you've over your head. But now that I'm a more experienced developer I can see how it would be hard to give a junior developer something to do in a project that I'm working on. Most of the time I'm under the gun trying to get something done and it would hurt my performance if I had to stop every so often to help a junior do something that they don't understand. What I'm thinking is you say it all with this statement: 

I don't know what the policies at this company is, I'm assuming that you probably aren't too sure either yet because you have just started, but what I do when I get a work laptop is just buy my own components. No one that I've ever worked for has had an issue with it. I've never really had the luxury of being able to specify what machine I want to work on, I just get what they have or what they've decided to order. I usually end up popping in some more RAM, maybe an SSD if there isn't one already. I can't stand working with something that just doesn't cut it. What you might be able to do is just order yourself a US keyboard layout for that laptop and switch it out. For some laptops this isn't that hard of a thing to do, but it depends on the laptop. Then, if and when you leave, you can swap the French keyboard back in there and give it back to them. Most laptop keyboards are pretty cheap. Just thought this might be an option, asking them if you can get your own keyboard and swap it out while you're using that laptop. 

I've never heard of anyone wanting to ask for a lower salary. But I guess it might make sense if you are planning on leaving the company after a certain amount of time. It also makes sense for them to offer somewhat above market rates to employees so they can hold on to them longer - perhaps this is what this company is doing. If a company is willing to pay me xxx more than any other company, how can I go anywhere else - right? My suggestion is that if you are planning on leaving this company before you've even accepted an offer from them, then maybe you should try to find a different place that you would like to work without having one foot out of the door before you even get both feet in. It's nice to think about your career long-term, but it would be easier to find a place to work that you would like to stay at long-term than it would be to try to plan out your next few positions/companies. 

I don't know what background checking company your new employer will use, but the last time that I had one done the dates on pretty much all of my jobs were "guess-timations" and they had to verify all of them and left notes on the background check like "said he worked for X from APR 2009 to JUN 2012 and it was actually MAR 2009 to MAY 2012"... I got the offer anyway. I don't think that they're really looking for 100% accuracy... and as long as you left your last job amicably I wouldn't worry too much about it. If it comes up at some point just be honest and say that things had changed since you sent them your resume. 

I could go on and on... As for positives, I think that pretty much anything that'll put them at ease and let them know that you're excited to make the move to their company would do. A good answer to this question would depend on the situation. Do you really want to leave your present job? Is this THE place you want to work? Do you want this company to know everything about what other companies are offering or might offer you? If you are really excited about moving to this company, give a good answer; if you're not too sure, give a vague answer; if you really would rather not, give any answer. Just don't show all of your cards, that's never a good idea. You don't owe anyone that.
