A rational person, by virtue of the qualifier rational should accept no miracles; his metaphysics sign-posted by the word rational already precludes them. If a rock fell up into the sky; such a person who holds onto their metaphysical beliefs rigorously will not jump to the conclusion that he has seen a miracle; but a phenomena that is presently not understood by science. This of course does not imply that a man has fidelity to a religous tradition cannot be rational too; that he can accept both the articles of faith and the description of the world as described by the close observation of it, that is science; his metaphysical assumptions are different; were he to see a rock fall up into the sky; he wold call that an act of God; but on further reflection he might then call all acts of nature acts of God; and that nature acts in fidelity to the laws of God; and it is this sentiment that motivates the wonder that there is anything at all; or that we are here to contemplate it and act in it. It worth while to examine what I've written above in the ligt of what Simone Weil, wrote in The Need for Roots: 

It looks like you're referring to the Everetts many worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. This is a solution of the wavefunction collapse, where one can say a measurement has been made. This possibly requires a little elaboration. First, measurement is not just what a physicist does when he measures the momentum of an electon or an atom, but what every system does when it reacts to another: One could say here, that the first system 'measures' a property of another system and reacts accordingly; but it is also true that the second system measures the first system and also reacts accordingly. Secondly, and putting it simply, one could say - at least intuitively - that the wave-function represents the possibilities which hold until a measurement occurs, and then the wave-function 'collapses'. One ought to note that the wave function evolution is deterministic until collapse, and this collapse is non-deterministic; and so a certain value is chosen at random for the measured property. Classically, since Newton, physicists have expected that the universe to be deterministic and real and this held upto the discovery of General Relativity by Einstein. Quantum Mechanic broke this paradigm it seemed irretrievably and the locus of the problem seemed to be the non-deterministic (ie random) evolution of the wave function collapse and also the interpretation of the wave function as possibitities. It was Everetts aim to retrieve this deterministic & real character for the then new Quantum Mechanics. He posited then every collapse engenders a new universe. Thus a possibility is no longer a possibility but another dimension of reality. This seems a rather high cost for determinism and realism. As an interpretation it is intriguing but esoteric, and at least physically one requires something more; does this picture of reality provide us e*explanatory power* - Everett attempted to provide one by deriving the basic Borns Rule from it. There is no consensus as to whether this has been done. Its worth pointing out, given the eye-catching, media and science-fiction friendly parallel world vista of Everetts that a different and much less well known intepretation, Bohmian Mechanics also retrieves realism and determinism by allowing non-locality - that is faster-than-light signalling. Now, given the tremendous success of the atomic hypothesis in modern physics, and this covers not just the idea of the classical atom, but also quanta (for are they not discrete?) it seemed only natural to think that perhaps even the very structure of space & time is atomic (there are various research programmes that look at this - spin foam and causal nets), and one expects this structure to appear at the Planck scale. Then given that there has only a finite time has passed since the creation of the universe (the Big Bang), it appears only a finite number of universes are possible, though their number is increasing exponentially. Its intriguing to consider what kinds of conditions might want to consider that allows either a countably infinite number of universe, or simply (!) uncountable. Personally, my intuition would be that at least one of the basic categories of physical materialism - matter/energy, space-time and gauge-forces are infinitely divisible. But one also should consider that a rule-of-thumb operates in Physics, which is that infinities are to be avoided: one does not have infinite energies, nor an infinite past, and nor an infinite amount of matter, and nor even an infinite expanse of space. On that basis one might want to rule out an infinite number (of whatever cardinality) of worlds. 

This is a term taken from Artaud, the originator of the theatre of cruelty; biologically, a body is nothing but the sum of its organs; by making the organs disappear, the body becomes smooth;D+G appropriate the example of the Dogon egg, based on the anthropological work of Griule, according to whom, organises all domains of Dogon life - kinship, village layout, the body etc; for D+G, Artuad, rejects the world of surfaces and appearances, and returning to the body, is an explorer of depths; that is the BwO signifies depth rather than surface - recall the skin of a actual, real-life body is an organ. 

If one considers the larger view, that religions represent a particular view on the world, as do philosophies; then the concept translates into respecting other worldviews or weltenschauungs. What is the ethical basis of such respect or tolerance? One might point to the golden rule - do as you would unto others as you would want done unto you; but not thought through persons but through worldviews. To which, one might argue, as you have is not better to respect persons rather than worldviews; to which one might reply the two aren't mutually exclusive - and the relationship between one and the other and between is complex. 

As Labreur states, this problem is called The Ship of Theseus. Spinoza, in his Ethics, provided a solution to this problem on the basis of his Descartian (amongst other influences) of his philosophy. 

Epistemic violence is visited on the subaltern subject, who contra D+F, cannot speak; When they speak in their own name, they are not heard; thus rendered mute they become silent, and become as tabula rasa on which the hegonomic discourse can be inscribed; then when they speak, they speak not in their own name, they are no longer conscious of their own names, but in the name of the hegonomic discourse. D+F, by abandoning the notion of Ideology, first theorised as 'false consciousness' by Marx, and then by Althusser, building on the psychoanalytic work of Lacan, the inaccessability of the Real by our immersion in language foreclose the 'difficult task of counter-hegonomic ideological production'. D+F, 'represent themselves as transparent', and then the 'self-knowing, politically canny subalterns stand revealed' and speaking, they are heard - but when one listens one hears only the hegenomic episteme. Spivak accuses D+F of abandoning the historical project of the intellectual (in Marxist discourse) of representing the dispossessed, those that no longer own their own names. The 'common man', is a 'victim of common-sense', and is so deeply embedded in 'empirical positivism', that he can no longer see beyond the 'concrete'; there is always a necessity of 'de-fetishizing the concrete'; she has been 'trying to point out that the uncommon man, the contemporary philosopher of practise, sometimes exhibits the same positivism'. D+F, align themselves with 'sociologists who fill the place of ideology with a continuistic unconscious or a parasubjective culture', and thus, 'in the name of desire they have reintroduce the undivided subject into the discourse of power'. Spivak contra this natural discourse of desire follows Marx, in affirming the importance, the recognition of something that is 'artificial' to begin with - 'the economic conditions of existence that sepearte their mode of existence'. To her, the 'contemporary invocations of the libidinal economy and desire as the determining interest, combined with practical politics of the oppressed - speaking for themselves - restore the category of the sovereign subject within the theory that seems most to question it. She notes that 'Saids critique of power in Foucault as a captivating and mystifying category allows him to obliterate the role of classes, the role of economics, the role of 'insurgency and rebellion' as important, to which she adds the submerged subject of power and desire and the 'transparent intellectual'. She declare that this transparent subject belongs to the exploiters side of the international division of labour. 

Most of physics is logically flawed - the example I usually go for is that of the calculus which Newton used for various arguments in his Physics; it was Bishop Berkeley that pointed out the logical in the arguments; not really to kick physics down but to point out there are various kinds of 'reasoning' - which ought to be obvious when reflected on - the literary imagination is different from the logical; and the theological is different from the physical. I'm speculating here; as I do not know the history very well, but I suspect he was defending traditional Christian epistemology from various attacks which originated in a purely materialist doctrine. Trying to put physics on a logically coherent foundation is a large question and a large project - there are various axiomatisations of Newtonian physics, and quantum field theory - its an ongoing project. One of the biggest 'logical' holes in Physics is the use of Occams Razors; for example there is no logic that can prove there are only four forces. Perhaps, at the incredibly high energy levels when the universe is compressed to the size of a golf-ball a new powerful field comes into existence - who knows; possibly and most probably we can never know.
