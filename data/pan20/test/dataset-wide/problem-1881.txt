First, you should politely remind your boss that you made non-refundable plans based on his prior approval. Next, it would be a good idea to see if you can find a positive solution to the dilemma. For example, can you do some additional preparation work in advance so your presence is not needed? Can you arrange for a coworker to take your place? Can you be on call at specific times while at the festival? If your boss still insists that you cancel your plans, then you can request to be compensated for canceling your plans and/or you can threaten to leave your job for something else. Given the long lead time between now and the festival, there is a reasonable chance that the company's plans or timelines will change in the mean time. Depending on how strongly you feel, you might wait longer to see if they will change before forcing the issue. You might also use the large time window to look for a new job and make them aware that you have previously made plans for that week that you cannot change. 

Knowing how to help yourself find relevant information is critical to on the job success. Like it or not, Google is a powerful tool for quickly answering questions. It's a good idea to do a quick search before asking others. It's like calling tech support and being able to say you already tried rebooting and it didn't help. 

If you want to continue to grow as a developer, there comes a point where your individual contribution alone is not enough to continue advancing. Having ever more technical knowledge and solving ever more technically challenging problems are good, but too much of that alone will get you labeled as a cowboy coder. Making yourself irreplaceable by holding knowledge or obfuscating your work may give you job security, but it will limit your advancement possibilities. Eventually, you will be measured by how well you can technically lead a group of developers or set the technical direction that others follow. Being able increase team velocity by mentoring junior developers, sharing knowledge to help overcome impediments or generally improve practice are important components to this. In short, keeping things to yourself may help you in the short term, but it will limit you in the long term. 

Your thought process seems pretty reasonable. I would call or send an e-mail to your contact in the company and explain the situation as you have here: 

Failure to ensure time critical things are being done is as much your problem as the person who needs to have it fixed. Escalating too quickloy has the potential to make you look bad for not having a full understanding of the situation rather than forcing the repair to happen faster. For example, imagine that the repair person actually has a more pressing task to attend to and your request has been received and explicitly deprioritized. Escalating actually get you this information, but it will not replace the lost time you could have spent in searching for alternate solutions. This scenario is somewhat unlikely, but it illustrates that that your next step should be a follow up either via e-mail to confirm that the request has been received or directly in person. If you still get no response, progress or reasonable explanation, then you should escalate. 

To maximize your chances of getting these year end perks, you should not submit your notice until after you receive them. 

The high road in this particular case would be to first convince your coworker that you have a valid argument against what he proposed, and then, together, approach your manager about revising the decision. 

You might consider declining the job (and the test). I would not want to have a positive drug test in my history. I know that confidentiality rules should prevent any one from learning the results (other than those in the specific chain that are expected to learn the results). But information has a way of spreading. Could someone at this company talk to someone at another company and jeopardize your chances there (not legal, but if they aren't caught, how would you know)? If I thought there was a possibility that I would legitimately fail a test, I would not take it. There will of course be consequences for this job, but it would end there. You don't have to disclose your reason for withdrawing from consideration, so rumors of drug use would not follow you beyond this point. 

Find a way to keep their attention during this transition. If you stop talking and bury your head in your laptop, the audience will fill that time with something. If on the other hands, you use that time to ask the audience a question, give them a thought experiment, or find some other way to engage them while you are making your technical transition, you are more likely to keep their attention. This will require practice and may require a change in software or hardware,or even assistance from a team member, but it is primarily a presentation technique. 

Simple answer: Yes. Why are you looking for people in their early 20's? It seems you should be looking for people that can do a particular job at a particular level of skill and quality. If they can do the job, what difference does age make? If they cannot do the job, what difference does age make? Hire based on their skills and abilities. 

The bottom line is that it doesn't hurt to go inside and ask. Do keep in mind that you are making your first impression immediately, so be dressed and groomed appropriately for one of their retail associates. 

A family member is a candidate for a contract position. The position requires a background check, including fingerprints (this information was just shared). The concern is that the prints will be digitized. With biometric authentication becoming more commonplace, that digital biometric data is more important (you can change a password that's been compromised, but you cannot change your fingerprints or retina patterns). Can anyone provide insight into how this is done currently? (Many years ago I was fingerprinted for a couple of jobs, but it was ink on a card that went into a file cabinet and was never actually sent anywhere). The major concern is the security of the biometric data. 

I would dress as if I were a new candidate interviewing for the first time. You are trying to transition from contracting to a permanent employee, and to transition into a new department. Dressing for the interview can set a mood and demonstrate that you are not making assumptions about your prospects based on personal familiarity. You know the office, so you know what everyone normally wears. I would dress at least as well as the normal office dress of the person who will be conducting the interview, probably a notch above. If they are interviewing outside candidates, they may change their normal dress for interview days. 

The simple answer is, it doesn't hurt to try. If the store is an independent, then it's likely that hiring decisions are made by someone in the store and they can take your resume and act on it. If the store is part of a larger chain, they may do one of many things: 

I would try to find out if the positions are in the same department. If they are not, then no worries. If they are, you may want to mention this to the recruiter that calls you for the second interview. ("I just wanted to be up front, but I already have an interview scheduled for _ position. I am not sure if this is with the same manager that you are working with, but I thought I would let you know just in case) Recruiting companies work on the same (as recruiting competitors) and different (exclusive openings just worked on my one recruiter) all the time. If you don't get called to interview on the second opening - then there is not any need to disclose. 

Yes. Remind them. Politely of course. Recruiters are usually working on several positions at the same time....and it gets crazy. It could be they didn't receive ( or their system misplaced ) your reply. Good luck 

I'd just expect to see the university where the degree was completed.....not the list of schools where you took credit classes. If they require a transcript, some universities have the combined versions as part of your student record. Otherwise providing two transcripts is not a big deal 

Many companies really want people that are deep in the technology but can also understand the business. That is pretty rare. I would be sure to include that information in your summary (resume and online profiles) "equally skilled in Vendor Management as well as Database Business Analysis functions......" I agree with including it in the cover letter - but some/many recruiters don't read them (sorry but true - they are a 2nd file in our systems), so be sure to blend that information in the resume itself. Also be sure to add the appropriate tools/technologies/keyword associated with the technical work that you are doing. 

We like the skills, like you've been listing them at the top. The details on how you used them should be detailed in the job section. It's important for hiring managers to know where you did what. Example. Networking. "Installed and configured Microsoft servers, updated software and supported business unit users" Is vastly different if you did this at a 10 person law firm vs. a 10,000 person technology company. That's why employment specific details are needed in the body of the résumé 

Many people list their technologies at the top section of their resumes ( sometimes even with years or months of experience) and then expand on how it was used under them jobs/employment section. We can tell from those details your basic level of skill. If you list 17 skills on an 8 month assignment though ( we do see this a lot) we know you didn't use them equally or to an expert level. 

Being a 'go to' person isn't all bad - but if you are just getting the grunt work - then yes it is time to demonstrate your value. Saying "I have several priority projects on my plate right now- would you like for me to talk to my manager to see which one he/she wants me to move down the priority list to handle your request?" That is professional - but also demonstrates that your time is valuable too. As an extra nice gesture (since you are the nicest 'can-do' team player), send them an email later with a link to training of an article on how to quick start using that tool. 

Yes! See what is going on. See who is doing what. Meet new people in your industry. Relationships always have value - but the value may be in the future. People that you find interesting - be sure to follow up with them later. Linkedin Invitation - with follow up notes from time to time. There is not really any value with meeting new people - if you are not going to get to know them more so that they move into your 'real' network.
