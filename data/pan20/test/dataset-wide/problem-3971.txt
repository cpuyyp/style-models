Let $\mathbb{S}$ denote Sacks forcing. Let $\mathbb{S}_{\omega_2}$ denote the $\omega_2$-length countable support iteration of Sacks forcing. Let $G_{\omega_2} \subseteq \mathbb{S}_{\omega_2}$ be generic over $L$ for $\mathbb{S}_{\omega_2}$. By the usual results around proper forcing, you can show that $L[G_{\omega_2}] \models 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_2$. You can show that no Cohen reals over $L$ are added by showing that every real of $L[G_{\omega_2}]$ is contained in a ground model coded closed meager set. Note that Cohen forcing is forcing equivalent to $\mathbb{P}_{I_\text{meager}}$, the forcing of nonmeager Borel sets. Hence a Cohen real is not contained in any ground model meager set. For simplicity, let first consider one Sacks forcing $\mathbb{S}$. Let $\tau \in V^{\mathbb{S}}$ and $\tau$ be a name for a real not in the ground model. Then do a fusion argument to produce a condition $p$ so that at every split node $s$ of $p$, $p_{s0}$ and $p_{s1}$ determines a certain finite amount of $\tau$ and what $p_{s0}$ determines about $\tau$ and what $p_{s1}$ determines about $\tau$ differs in at least two places. If you let $T$ be the set of all finite strings $t$ so that $t$ is an initial segment of what $p_s$ can determined about $\tau$ for some $s \in {}^{<\omega}2$, then you get a tree so that at each split node the two sides differ two times before splitting again. By the definability of forcing, $T \in L$. You can show that body $[T]$ is meager closed set and $p \Vdash \tau \in [\check T]$. If you understand how to do this for 1-Sacks forcing, now do an iterated Sacks forcing version of this. This tends to be quite heavy in notation. See Geschke and Qickert $\textit{On Sacks Forcing and the Sacks property}$ for more information. Essentially the argument above is a modified version of their proof of the 2-localization property. Also see their paper on how to do the iterated Sacks version of the 2-localization property. 

A wonderful mistake, which paved the way to singular cardinals, was done by Felix Bernstein in his dissertation. I learnt this from Menachem Kojman. Berstein thought he had proved that for every ordinal $\alpha$, $\aleph_\alpha^\omega=\aleph_\alpha \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}$. This is true for every $\alpha < \omega$ but already fails for $\alpha=\omega$. Berstein's mistake was to assume that every cardinal has an immediate predecessor. Kőnig later used Berstein's result to prove that the continuum is not an aleph, thus disproving at once two of Cantor's main beliefs: 1) every set can be well-ordered and 2) the continuum hypothesis! He presented his result at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg in 1904 and the organizers cancelled all parallel session to allow all participants (which included Cantor and Hilbert) to attend Kőnig's lecture. And his discovery was even reported in the local news! Here is Kőnig's reasoning: First he proves the correct result that for every ordinal $\beta$, $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega>\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$ (a special case of what is now known as Kőnig's Theorem). He then reasons that if the continuum were an aleph, say $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_\beta$, then substituting $\alpha=\beta+\omega$ into Berstein's result one obtains that $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega=\aleph_{\beta+\omega} \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$, which is a contradiction! 

Malykhin constructed a consistent example of a Tychonoff non-normal maximal space in this paper: V. I. Malykhin, "Extremally disconnected and similar groups", Soviet Math. Dokl. 16 (1975), 21–25. 

If you're interested in the relationship between the ccc and separability, you should read Stevo Todorcevic's survey "Chain condition methods in topology". $URL$ It's a very convincing pamphlet on the power of chain conditions, clarifying that relationship with such beautiful theorems as: 1) (Todorcevic) Let X be compact Hausdorff. If every subspace of $X^2$ has the ccc then $X$ is separable. 2) (Rosenthal) A compact Hausdorff space $X$ is ccc if and only if every weakly compact subspace of $C(X)$ is separable. Also, there's a whole book dedicated to chain conditions. It's called "Chain conditions in topology", by Wistar Comfort and Stelios Negropontis (Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics #79, Cambridge University Press). 

Of course, a formula $\varphi$ with all these properties must be a counterexample to the Vaught's conjecture. So the real essence of this question is whether (regardless of the status of Vaught's conjecture), is it possible that the Scott rank of models of $\varphi$ take on all admissible values but no model of $\varphi$ has Scott rank in between two consecutive admissible ordinal. The natural idea to try is to use Barwise compactness to produce a model of $\varphi$ of intermediate Scott rank. However, whenever one works in a countable admissible fragment $\mathscr{L}_A$, one can not really express non-isomorphism to the model whose Scott rank is the ordinal height of the admissible set $A$. So any model $M$ produced using a Barwise argument using $L_A$, could just be isomorphic to the possibly unique model with Scott rank the ordinal height of $A$. The question is whether by some reason there must be a model of $\varphi$ whose Scott rank is between two consecutive admissible ordinals. Thanks for any information on this question. 

Suppose $\mathbb{P}$ is a definable proper forcing (for instance Sacks forcing). Let $\alpha$ be some ordinal. Let $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$ be the countable support iteration of $\mathbb{P}$ of length $\alpha$. It is well known that $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$ is also proper. Hence for any countable elementary structure $M \prec H_\Theta$ for sufficiently large $\Theta$ such that $\mathbb{P}_\alpha \in M$ and any $p \in \mathbb{P}_\alpha \cap M$, there exists some $q \leq_{\mathbb{P}_\alpha} p$ which is a $(M, \mathbb{P}_\alpha)$-generic condition. Let $X = \alpha \cap M$. The question is whether a $(M, \mathbb{P}_\alpha)$ generic condition $q \leq_{\mathbb{P}_\alpha} p$ can be found such that $\text{supp}(q) \subseteq X$. Thanks for any information that can be provided. 

The Baireness of $C_k(X)=C_k(X,\mathbb{R})$ has been characterized for some subclasses of $k$-spaces. For example, Gruenhage and Ma proved that for a locally compact or first-countable space $X$, the following are equivalent: 

Joel has already shown you that none of the standard separation axioms is enough to force a positive answer to your question (by the way, the Sorgenfrey line is even perfectly normal). A notable case for which your question has a positive answer is that of a topological group. Define the $\pi$-weight of $X$ ($\pi w(X)$) to be the least cardinality of a family $\mathcal{P}$ of non-empty open subsets of $X$ such that for every non-empty open set $U \subset X$ there is $P \in \mathcal{P}$ such that $P \subset U$. It is clear that if $RO(X)$ is a base for $X$ then the density of $RO(X)$ coincides with the $\pi$-weight of $X$. This happens, in particular, if $X$ is a regular space. Now topological groups are regular, and the $\pi$-weight and the weight of a topological group coincide. (for a proof of that see, for example, Arhangel’skii, Alexander; Tkachenko, Mikhail, Topological groups and related structures, Atlantis Studies in Mathematics 1. Hackensack, NJ: World Scientific; Paris: Atlantis Press (ISBN 978-90-78677-06-2/hbk). xiv, 781 p. (2008). ZBL1323.22001.) Another case in which $\pi w(X)=w(X)$ is when $X$ is a metric space (because the $\pi$-weight is bounded below by the density and bounded above by the weight, and for metric spaces, the weight and the density coincide). 

This innocent and reasonable statement is actually equivalent to the negation of the Continuum Hypothesis. The equivalence was first proved by Sierpiński, and is actually very easy to see. If CH holds, let $\{x_\alpha: \alpha < \omega_1\}$ be an enumeration of the reals in type $\omega_1$, the function defined by $f(x_\alpha)=\{x_\beta: \beta \leq \alpha \}$ is a counterexample to the boxed statement or otherwise we'd have a pair of ordinals $\alpha, \beta < \omega_1$ such that both $\alpha < \beta$ and $\beta < \alpha$. Suppose now that CH fails and let $f: \mathbb{R} \to [\mathbb{R}]^{\leq \aleph_0}$. Let $S$ be a set of reals of cardinality $\aleph_1$. Let $T=\bigcup \{f(x): x \in S \}$. The set $T$ has cardinality $\aleph_1$ and hence we can pick a real number $y \notin T$. Since $f(y)$ is countable we can pick a real number $z \in S \setminus f(y)$. We have both $z \notin f(y)$ and $y \notin f(z)$. 

Another way to see this: If $A$ is closed, Borel, or analytic in code $x$ and $A$ is countable, then $A$ consists entirely of $x$-hyperarithmetic elements. This means, let $\omega_1^x$ be the sup of $x$-computable ordinals. Then $A \subseteq L_{\omega_1^x}[x]$, a level of Godel constructible hierarchy. In $V[G]$, if $A$ is analytic in parameter $x \in V$ and $A$ is countable, then $A \subseteq L[x] \subseteq V$. So $A$ has only ground model elements. 

"The Extent of Scales in $L(\mathbb{R})$" Corollary 6 shows that $\mathsf{DET}_\mathbb{R}(\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1)$ can not hold in $L(\mathbb{R})$. Steel shows this by proving that $G^\mathbb{R}\Pi_1^1$ (the game quantifier class) is $\Sigma_1(L(\mathbb{R}, \{\mathbb{R}\})$. By $\mathsf{DET}_\mathbb{R}(\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1)$, $G^\mathbb{R} \Sigma_1^1$ is the dual of $G^\mathbb{R}\Pi_1^1$. Hence $G^\mathbb{R}\Sigma_1^1$ is $\Pi_1(L(\mathbb{R}, \{\mathbb{R}\})$. But you can directly show that $G^\mathbb{R}\Sigma_1^1$ is contained in $\Sigma_1(L(\mathbb{R}),\{\mathbb{R}\})$. Contradiction. ($\Sigma_1(L(\mathbb{R},\{\mathbb{R}\})$ is also $(\Sigma^2_1)^{L(\mathbb{R}}$. Using Wadges lemma and the not-ordinal-definable relation $R$ from above, Steels showed that if $\mathsf{AD}^{L(\mathbb{R})}$ holds, then a set has a scale in $L(\mathbb{R})$ if and only if it belongs to $(\mathbf{\Sigma}^2_1)^{L(\mathbb{R})}$. ) The same paper of Steel also notes that assuming $\mathsf{AD}$, $\mathsf{DET}_\mathbb{R}(\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1)$ is equivalent to the existence of $\mathbb{R}^\sharp$. (At least in the paper, Steel states it is open whether the equivalence can be proved in just $\mathsf{ZF} + \mathsf{DC}$.) Assuming $\mathsf{AD}$, $\mathsf{DET}_\mathbb{R}(\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1)$ has stronger consistency strength than $\mathsf{AD}$. 

The only ideas I have are: In Solovay's paper about independence of DC, he showed that under $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, for all $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$, $(A,R)^\sharp$ exists. In $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, $(A,\mathbb{R})^\sharp$ is homogeneously Suslin. So $(A,\mathbb{R})^\sharp = p[U]$ for some homogeneously Suslin tree $U$. I am hoping perhaps one can show that $p[U]^{V[G]} = (A_G,\mathbb{R}^{V[G]})^\sharp$. Therefore, $(A,\mathbb{R})^\sharp \subseteq (A_G, \mathbb{R}^{V[G]})^\sharp$. I believe this will imply that there is an elementary embedding from $L(A,\mathbb{R})$ into $L(A_G,\mathbb{R}^{V[G]})$. I would like to know if the embedding above can exists under $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$. Can my vague argument possibly work? Are there other ways to obtain this embedding or the desired generic absoluteness. Thanks for any information and references. 

Frank Tall proved that under $MA+\neg CH$ there is a regular first-countable space with caliber $\omega_1$ which is not separable. (see Tall, Franklin D., First countable spaces with caliber $\aleph_1$ may or may not be separable, Set-theor. Topol., Vol. dedic. to M.K. Moore, 353-358 (1977). ZBL0382.54003.) Applying the Moore Machine to Tall's example you get what you're looking for. 

Yes, take any model of $\neg CH$ where a Suslin Line exists (for example, start with a ground model where $CH$ does not hold and use Tennenbaum's original forcing for adding a Suslin Tree). We can assume that our Suslin Line is compact. Indeed, let $Y$ be its Dedekind completion. Then $Y$ is a compact ccc linearly ordered topological space. We claim that $Y$ is not separable. Note that every ccc linearly ordered space is hereditarily Lindelof, so in particular, $Y$ has points $G_\delta$. Since $Y$ is compact, this implies that $Y$ is first-countable. If $Y$ were separable then, we could fix a countable dense subset $D$ of $Y$ and exploit first-countability to take, for every $x \in D$, a sequence $S_x$ inside our original Suslin Line, which converges to $x$. But then we would get that $\bigcup \{S_x: x \in D \}$ is a countable dense subset of our original Suslin Line, which is a contradiction. So $Y$ is a compact (first-countable) Suslin Line Since $Y$ is a compact first-countable space, by a theorem of Shapirovskii (see Juhasz's Cardinal Functions book), we can find a cardinal $\kappa$ and an irreducible continuous mapping $f$: $$f: Y \to \Sigma(\mathbb{R}^\kappa):=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^\kappa: |x^{-1}(1)| \leq \aleph_0 \}$$ The image $f(Y)$ is clearly a ccc Corson compact, and since irreducible maps preserve density, $f(Y)$ is not separable. So $f(Y)$ is a ccc non-metrizable Corson compact.
