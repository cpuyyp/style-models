and further on the Samkhya school (whose differences from the modern Vedanta school are not important here) (pp 211-12): 

The author then goes on to posit that the reality of time can make for a true cosmological theory. Very interesting book. 

Yes. But first, Buddha never claimed divinity. He said that he had attained Buddhahood through his realization of Nirvana and that same realization could be attained by all men. Second, Brahma is the title of the creator of the present universe. It's a position that is attained after a certain amount of austerities; it's more of a title like governor. Brahma is a devi. This has been very loosely translated as 'god', but the actual literal translation is 'shining one'. It is not a 'god' in the Greek sense. When this universe dissolves and a new universe is to start, a new soul becomes Brahma. Buddhists and Hindus say that the only proof of 'Reality" is in your own experience. Brahman (the ultimate Reality) and Nirvana are beyond the sensual world - as such there is no 'proof' in the sensual world. One must go beyond the senses. It can only be experienced. How is an object known? Either by the sense organs or the mind. Brahman is without form, without sound, touch, smell, or taste. "His form is not an object of vision; no one beholds Him with the eye." (Katha Upanishad II. iii. 9.) The light of Brahman endows the senses and the mind with their sentency; they cannot enlighten Brahman. The realization of the transcendent Absolute is an inexpressible experience in which the distinction between subject, object, and knowledge is annihilated and they become one. Nevertheless, although the only real proof is in the experience, there have been numerous arguments given for the existence of Brahman. Several good sources of these arguments are The Upanishads, Juana Yoga by Swami Vivekananda, Upadesa Sahasri of Sri Shankaracarya translation by Swami Jagadananda, and Self-Knowledge (Atmabodha of Shankaracharya) translation by Swami Nikhilananda. 

The only people completely free of desires are people who have realized their oneness with the Pure Consciousness - Brahman. So knowledge of Brahman and indifference to the world go hand in hand. 

Much later in the book, Loy says "The purpose of this section has been to show that, although Derrida's differance constitutes a major philosophical insight, his employment of it does not develop its most radical implications." Now, based on the above, if your question is interpreted as "Do modern continental philosophies act as a counter-weight or counter-argument to modern Anglo-American philosophies in the same way that the ancient sophists may have made counter-arguments to Plato?" then I would say yes. If you are, on the other hand, saying that post-modernism consists of specious arguments, as sophism has come to mean, then I would say no. 

Who is the "I" that is being referred to in your question that is or is not immortal? Eastern religions say that what most consider the I - the physical mind or ego, dies with the body, but there is an inner consciousness which does not die. Who is the real "I"? Ramana Maharshi said that this is the one question we should only ask ourselves - Who am I? Enlightenment is knowing your real I, and not the I of the ego. When you know the real I, you are immortal. Joseph Campbell gave the illustration of the light bulb, the light bulb may burn out, but the electricity that gave the light to the bulb, does not. Vivekananda said that it was this sense of the real I in us that gives us the feeling that we will never die. 

Nirguna and Suguna Brahman are the same, they are just perceived in different aspects, the inactive and the active. Swami Vivekananda (Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol 2 p 192) says 

Indian philosophy traces it's earliest roots to Kapila, the founder of the Sankhya philosophy which all Indian Philosophy is derived from. Some say that Pythagoras came to India and studied this philosophy during his travels. Kapila is mentioned by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. I am unaware of any date given to him, but very very early. 

Yes there is. Read the "Cloud of Unknowing", "Dark Night of The Soul", "The Interior Castle", "The Philokalia", and "The Way of Perfection" all by Christian mystics. 

Why or how the Infinite became the finite is an impossible question as it is self-contradictory. We can see this from another side when we seek to know how the Absolute has become the relative. Supposing we knew the answer, would the Absolute remain the Absolute? It would have become relative. What is meant by knowledge in our common sense idea? It is only something that has become limited by our mind, that we know, and when it is beyond our mind, it is not knowledge. Now if the Absolute becomes limited by the mind, It is no more Absolute; It has become finite. Everything limited by the mind becomes finite. Therefore, to know the Absolute is again a contradiction in terms. That is why the question has never been answered, because if it were answered, there would no more be an Absolute. A God known is no more God; He has become finite like one of us. He cannot be known. He is always the Unknowable One. 

The meaning of these verses is that from attachment to worldly pursuits you forget your spiritual ways, you lose your understanding of spiritual things, you lose your understanding of spiritual matters, and by perish it means you do not attain the Goal (Liberation, Nirvana). An easier understanding of the above is given in the Uddhava Gita XVI.19-21 (Uddhava Gita, The Last Message of Shri Krishna, Swami Madhavananda translator): 

The answer to both questions is yes. First there are no absolutes in this world. Moral principles are relative and can vary from time, place, and circumstances. Moral principles are there to guide you when you are beginning on the path of dharma, or for those who cannot follow dharma. Moral principles are like a fence around a young tree; necessary when it is young, but when the tree grows large, no fence is needed to protect it. An old Indian story says that you remove a thorn stuck in your finger with another thorn. When the thorn is removed, you can throw both thorns away. You remove evil with good, you remove bad tendencies with good tendencies. When the bad is removed you can throw both good and bad away. 

A study of the Upanishads shows that Eastern philosophical reasoning was in full bloom well before the Greeks. 

James Jean wrote in the Mysterious Universe - "To speak in terms of Plato's well known simile, we are still imprisoned in our cave, with our backs to the light, and can only watch the shadows on the wall...." and "Many would hold that, from the broad philosophical standpoint, the outstanding achievement of the twentieth century physics...is the general recognition that we are not yet in contact with ultimate reality."

Toleration has a very negative connotation, there is nothing positive about it. Tolerance means I am right, you are wrong, but I will tolerate - allow - your wrongness.........Religious tolerance carries this connotation. 

A rose by any other name is still a rose. A child is still a child. The human mind goes through a greatest physical and mental development during the teen years. To put the child on trial as an adult is for society to throw away all moral responsibility in trying to turn the child's life around. A 10 year old child has no mental reckoning as to what the lifetime consequences of his actions are. 

In 3.9.1 Plotinus goes further to define what is meant by the Intellectual-Principle (Divine Mind), the Intellectual Object, and who the contemplator is. By his argumentation, the contemplator is the Intellectual Object and
