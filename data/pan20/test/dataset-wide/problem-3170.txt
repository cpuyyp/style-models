The Reign of Terror resulted in an estimated 40,000 executions, primarily landed nobility, courtiers and clergy. Many upper class French emigrated to other countries. A typical example is that of Pierre du Pont, founder of the chemical company E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company. Being a member of the lesser nobility, the revolution never got around to executing him, so he survived. After 1794 the executions stopped, but the persecution continued. The economy was bad and the socialist elements that controlled the government made life difficult for ex-nobles. Du Pont tried becoming a printer, but it was hard to make money, so he left for America with his family. Other nobles just made do as best they could, working educated jobs. Many became lawyers, doctors or accountants. Large estates were broken up, but many nobles who survived still possessed smaller property or buildings and were able to retain and operate them after the Thermidorian Reaction, essentially becoming landlords. Some survivor types like Talleyrand acted like nothing ever happened. They just changed their spots to whatever was needed and stayed as rich as ever, serving the powers that be. There are many books on the terror if you want details of who was killed and when. As I have written above, the current estimate is about 40,000 dead. A good book to get started is "The Terror in the French Revolution" by Hugh Gough. That book has a bibliography with over 200 references. 

To me, count, two words. In other words "come to me, lets have a word or two". Don Rodrigo is below the count in status, but the two are close friends and well known to each other, so Don Rodrigo is informal. In plays like "La Veuve" which takes place in Paris and is dated to 1632, the servants and workers are always addressed by their occupation ("nurse", "coachman", etc) and the gentlefolk as either "Monsieur" or "Madame". 

Timber framed buildings cannot go above three floors (about 50 feet) because beyond that they cannot hold up their own weight. Often buildings would be constructed with the first or second floor made of masonry and then wooden floors above. The "average" number of floors in the middle of a city during the Renaissance would be two. Here is DÃ¼rer's "St. Anthony in the City" (1513) showing the typical Renaissance/Tudor view of a metropolis. 

Before Russia was an empire, it was a collection of duchies, each kinged by a duke. When all these dukes adopted Christianity, which happened at around the same time, they used a crest of three circles in a triangle as a sign of their fidelity to the conversion. Supposedly this was to answer to the trinity, but in truth it probably dates back to being a Mongol symbol from the time when Russia was ruled by the Golden Horde. The dukes just re-adapted the symbol to mean the holy Trinity. In the circles were placed their names, oaths and personal badges. Strahlemberg "Description de l'Empire Russe" vol I p. 240 (1757) 

Each institution has there own cataloguing system. In addition to that the archaeologist, if any, will have their own identification system which is usually dig-specific. So, for example, items dug up one season might have a different coding than those dug up the previous season. It all depends on the archaeologist. Ideally you would give all the numbers you had. So, for example, if the artifact has an archaeological coding and a museum coding, you would give both. 

Wide publicity was given to anti-Stalinist figures such as Alexander Kerensky, the former chair of the Russian provisional government, who spoke frequently in front of gatherings and crowds. In one interview in 1938 he said: 

So, if this chart is right we see the Bessemer converter being invented in the middle of the breakout, not at the beginning. In the 1851 data point we see a large increase in the production of steel, yet the Bessemer converter had not come into use yet. Is there some key technology advance that preceded the Bessemer converter that could have enabled this increase in production? Note that I am just guessing that there was some key advance that led to the increase in production. It is entirely possible that there was no technological advance, and that the number of factories and workers simply increased. (Just as an aside, some may wonder why there was a decline in the 1870s. The reason for that is a scrap effect. Much of the iron produced in the boom of the 1850s rusted and turned into scrap by the 1870s. By recycling all this scrap, the need for new production declined. A secondary cause was an increase in American production at that time.) 

Although technically the Sultan had all kinds of personal rights, in practice very few of these were actually exercised during the occupation, the main one being the raising of the Ottoman crescent flag over every mosque during the hours of prayer. Technically, the Sultan was entitled to a range of other various rights such as taxation monies and to arrest and execute anyone who insulted or criticized him, among other things; but these rights were ignored after the Austrians took power. According to the London Convention of 1871 there was an agreement that the convening powers (including England and Austria) would not break any of their treaties without the consent of the others. Another key factor was that the takeover of Bosnia was controversial in Austria because it required a large number of troops and involved fighting. Due to the controversy, there was enacted a law in 1880 that explicitly blocked Bosnia from being adducted to the monarchy except by the vote of both parliaments of Austria. This alone prevented Bosnia from being annexed to the monarchy for a long time, even though Austria ruled Bosnia de facto. The political situation changed in 1907-8. Firstly, the Serbs began supplying weapons to Bosnia and agitating by setting off bombs. Several newspapers in Sarejevo began publishing pro-Ottoman editorials, saying things like they only had fealty to the Sultan and so forth. Since Bosnia was ruled by a provincial diet, not the emperor, there was nothing directly the monarchy could do about this. Simultaneously, the gears began to turn. The Bulgarians wanted to seize Macedonia and the Austrian monarchy wanted to help them. To do this they began building a military train line called the Novi Bazar line out of Bosnia into Macedonia. This move would be guaranteed to activate pro-Ottoman revolutionary activity in Serbia and Bosnia, so the monarchy began to plan for an annexation so they could get dictatorial powers in Bosnia and not have to go through the provincial diet. When the Bulgarians declared independence it invalidated the Treaty of Berlin, so the monarchy felt that "legally speaking" they no longer had to respect the sovereignty of the sultan so they annexed Bosnia two days later and got rid of the provincial diet. To answer your main question, the main autonomy the Bosnians lost by the annexation was that laws were no longer made by the provincial diet, but rather by the crown of Austria. 

As you can see, it is identical to William's baton. William simply imitated Charles and used the same style of baton, even though he had no intention of claiming to be Constable of France. For William, it was just a plain marshal's baton. Phillip II, Charles' son, and Phillip III, his grandson also used exactly the same style of baton. In later years, William, who was mentored as a young man by Charles, became his deadly enemy. To address your question about the symbolism of this baton, you may want to learn more about Betrand du Guesclin and the Constables of France. The Constable was supposed to be the chief of the army under the king, but some of the Constables, such as du Guesclin, were quasi-independent military dictators. These men were sort of like Oliver Cromwell, styled "protectors" of the people. Their sceptre was a plain wooden rod, a watchman's club, because it symbolized their role as being sort of a chief policeman of the country. 

I would not characterize the situation the way Mises did. The English hardly needed the cooperation of the Muslims and other Nabobs to rule the country. At the Battle of Plassey (1757) they demonstrated decisively their military superiority. At their option they could depose any Maharajah they wished, simply by supplying weapons and support to whatever enemies of the Maharajah they wanted to replace him. One famous case was that of Rana of Jhalawar whom the English removed when he became non-cooperative. Also, when Punjab was annexed, many maharajahs were deposed and replaced. The English supported whatever entity seemed to be most convenient. If a maharajah was cooperative and useful, they supported him. If he created problems, or opposed them, they would seek to have him removed and replaced. Money and commerce were the driving factors in these interactions, not ideology. 

A modern secondary historical paper or book should always use the Gregorian Calendar and the era of Exiguus. For pre-Gregory dates the proleptic calendar should be used. The reason for this is so that the exact distance between two dates can always be calculated easily and so that all books are using the same time scale so that dates in one book can easily be compared to those in other books. In cases where a date from a source document is being used, then that date should be given verbatim, as it appears in the source document with no interpretation or conversion, along with the era and calendar being used so far as it is known, followed by the believed Gregorian equivalent. For example, 

It was much like cars are today. If a person has a car today, you can imagine that same basic type of person would have had a horse in 1900. To answer your next question, yes, a lot of people had really crappy horses. Much like most people today drive around in crappy old Civics and Corollas and F150s (although it may not seem this way to you if you are middle or upper class). If you go back to 1850, a significant number of people rode around on mules, but by 1900 nearly everyone could either afford some kind of horse or be able to borrow a horse from a parent or relative if needed. From some of the comments above, I think some people have the idea that a horse was some sort of luxury, which is not true at all. In 1900 you could get a good, solid horse for about $150 and an old nag for as little as $10. An unskilled laborer made about $20 a week and skilled laborer made double that. A professional, like a good lawyer would make a lot more. So, even a relatively low earning worker could make enough for quite a good horse in about 2 months. Even a person making almost nothing, a beggar, could probably scrounge up a worthless old nag if they wanted to, just like today you can get a junk car that runs for about $350, the cost of scrap. In 1900, the equivalent was the "glue" value of a horse, about $10. Nowadays, an unskilled worker has a take home pay of about $12 an hour or about $500 per week. In 2 months, that is $4,000, enough to buy a decent car. For example, I drive an old Volvo 850 with leather seats, power everything and a sunroof which cost me $3,000 in cash. Thus, you can see, things have not changed as much as you might think. 

In the open ocean, the limiting factor is fresh water for the crew. An active crew member will require about 1 gallon of water per day. A big 60-foot longship might easily carry 1200 gallons, enough for 100 men for 12 days. In a hostile area, or exploring long distances, or making a long military campaign, food will be a factor. It is much easier to find fresh water on land than food. 

Hyneyw - a royal counselor Tywysog - a noble Note that all of these words have lots of different spellings. A king may be "brennin" or "brennan" or "vrenhin" or many other spellings. 

The Roman calendar (on which the Gregorian calendar was based) was synchronized with a celestial event: the lunar cycle. Originally, each Roman month began on the first day of the new moon. However, it was timed according to the full moon, which fell on the ides. The reason for this is that the full moon occurs on only a single day, but a new moon can last several days. Therefore, originally the key event was the full moon, because it was unambiguous. Between the new moon and a full moon are a little over 14 days. Therefore, originally the Romans made the Ides fall on the full moon and the Kalends (the first day of the month) fall either 13 days or 15 days before in a schedule designed to average out correctly. In the reign of Numa Pompilius the calendar was regularized so that this synchronism was no longer kept. The Roman ritual New Year occurred on the Kalends of March because March is the month in which the Spring solstice occurs. The civil year was switched to begin on the Kalends of January in 153 BC for political reasons: the Senate wanted the new consul Quintus Fulvius Nobilior to attack the city of Segeda during the Celtiberian Wars immediately. Therefore, they moved up the day of the appointment from the Kalends of March to the Kalends of January. So, to summarize, the short answer to your question is that the months were originally aligned to the day of the full moon, but when the calendar was fixed to the solar year, this synchronization was lost. The reason why the solar calendar was not aligned with the solar event (solstice) was that Numa Pompilius kept the sequence of days roughly as they had been under the lunar calendar. If he had changed the Kalends of March to fall on the solstice, then things might be synchronized in the way you suggest, but he probably did not want to disrupt the flow of days as it then existed. 

The uranium-based gun design was the fundamental approach of the project from the beginning. The "fat man" design used plutonium-239, a substance much easier to produce than uranium-235, but requiring a much more complicated implosion type warhead. It was not clear until 1944 that the implosion design would even work. John von Neumann essentially invented an entirely new branch of physics, called shock wave theory, that was used to design the implosion lenses for the device. Once it became clear that the implosion technique was feasible and necessary for plutonium, the fat man design was added as an improved approach for a second (and all future) bombs. Thus, the development of the weapon proceeded on two tracks. The benefits were to have a relatively high-probability-of-success weapon (uranium bomb) and a more advanced bomb (plutonium) for future development. 

This is not really a history question, but anyway... I presume we are talking about shells here, not bombs. You may want to read "High Explosive Shells" By Percy E. Barbour, E. A. Suverkrop (1915) which you can find on Google Books. Shells can (and did) have dual fuzes so that the shell would explode if it hit something before timer expired. There are many different types of possible fuzing arrangements with widely different outcomes. In World War I, the preferred fuze was a timed fuze so that the shell would burst in the air above the enemy. 

During the war the policy of the United States Congress and the President and the chiefs of the armed services was to attack Japan and Germany with the full and undivided power of the country until they surrendered absolutely and unconditionally. This was made abundantly clear at multiple points, including the joint Proclamation Defining Terms for Japanese Surrender issued after the Potsdam conference: 

This refers to the French pound, the livre. French money was in common use in Germany, Italy and many other places during the 1700s. The livre was worth about $12 - $25. There were 24 silver livres in a Louis, which was the gold coin. 

German anthropologists, led by Hermann Burmeister, opposed this theory. Burmeister proposed a catastrophe theory of human evolution, similar to that of Cuvier. According to these ideas people evolved not gradually, but very rapidly and independently. William Henry Holmes was active in disputing that there was any evidence humans were in the Americas before the last glaciation, and therefore must have come from elsewhere. Franz Boas disputed this and argued that man came in the interglacial period. Likewise, Daniel Garrison Brinton argued that American man must have arrived in the glacial period and since Siberia was thought to be uninhabited at that time, they could not have a Siberian origin, but must have been Polynesian or some other Asiatic emigration. Brinton also argued that Eskimoes are completely distinct from Siberians, yet occupy the entire Arctic circle, so they and other Americans, who are akin to them, must have had an independent, non-Siberian origin. Also, he disputed that the idea that America was cutoff because Eskimoes circumnavigate with no need for a land bridge. Prior to these theories, there was a large school of thought that considered Americans to be autochthonous. These theorists included: Levegue, Humboldt, McCullogh, Morton and Quatrefages. Most of these ideas proposed only semi-autochthony and had some catastrophic or evolutionary component. A few theorists, such as Kaimes, Morton, Nott and Glidden supported fully autochthonous origins with no old world component. Note that many old theories included over-land travel, so the idea that a "land bridge" is a modern idea is somewhat incorrect. The theme that native Americans derived from Siberians of some kind or Mongolians was prevalent very early on. Just as a side note, the "theories" that Indians derived from Israelites or Phoenicians or some such, were just fantasies by "historians" writing for a public audience, and were not considered serious science by real anthropologists. I have listed above the main scientific thinkers from the pre-modern period who were considered serious scientists.
