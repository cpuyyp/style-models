Truth functional temporalism, the idea that a proposition's truth value is affected by its relative position in a compound sequence even if no overt tense differentiation is made, can be invoked to resolve certain paradoxes. The barber who decides to shave today all and only those who didn't shave themselves yesterday will shave himself today if he didn't yesterday either, but won't if he did. End of problem. (Ditto mutatis mutandi for the Russell set paradox.) 

Just because a statement of the form IF A THEN B, or p > q, does not necessarily describe two events or situations occurring in succession, does that also go for one of the form IF A THEN NOT A, or p > ¬p ? How can the two propositions in this expression be simultaneously true? This is the crack in formal logic through which we can glimpse the river of time. Nevertheless, the expression is not seen as a nonsense or self-contradictory in standard propositional calculus - check with a truth table. And moreover along with its converse, ¬p > p, it forms part of two basic theorems: (p > ¬p) = ¬p, (¬p > p) = p These are sometimes known as the "Paradoxes of implication", but nevertheless have a soundly rational interpretation as a fundamental logical principle. When a proposition is followed by its negative, the connective > ¬ (or reverse) becomes an updating or correcting function. The latest assertion, the one you end up with, is the one you want acknowledged as the final say on the matter, however much at odds it is with what went before. It's the latest, corrected version of your essay you want accepted, not the earliest. When you see a circus poster with a "cancelled" sticker across it, you assume it is indeed cancelled as of now if that negating sticker was appended after the poster was put up. The relative position of a proposition in a sequence is not normally taken to indicate relative position in time. Once they're written on the surface of a page, all propositions in a formal argument, like all lines in a static diagram or graph are present to the viewer simultaneously. Can we have logic without time? Yes, if we can have a geometry without time. But time in formal logic, as in geometry, is the hidden extra dimension. 

The two approaches described in the question correspond closely but not perfectly to those set out by Carl Hempel in his classic "Two Models of Scientific Explanation". One he calls "Deductive-nomological", the other "Probabalistic". However he differs from the questioner in that he assumes that covering laws are invoked in both cases. A lot seems to depend on whether laws are considered to include generalisations and correlations, or to specify something more fundamental and compelling. 

Addressing the second half of the question: The likely goals of a "war on obesity" seem, to me, not to parallel those of the cluster of US policies that "The War On Drugs" usually refers to. So it's possible it would play out differently. Obesity is a long-term condition, a cumulative effect of things that happen over some period of time. Preventing obesity might involve forbidding or mandating certain moment-to-moment choices (banning chocolate, requiring exercise to use public services) but those things are not themselves the goal. It's theoretically possible to end obesity without eradicating any of the behaviors that promote it. On the other hand, anti-drug goals are often, if not always, stated in terms of ending drug use (the moment-to-moment choice) rather than drug addiction or other long-term drug conditions. See William Bennett's statement here or a US official boasting about cocaine shortages. (Note that long-term harms from the use of certain drugs are often cited as a motivation for banning drug use, but that is not the same as using them to characterize what a program's simple intent is.) For an anti-obesity program to be futile for the reasons the "War On Drugs" is, it would need to be framed as a "war on dessert" and use an all-or-nothing framing under which each time any person eats a donut is a mark against the program, with long-term obesity rates being at best a second-order indicator of success. I agree that a "war on smoking" would most likely take a form parallel to the War On Drugs, i.e. an attempt to ban and interdict cigarettes, and would likely be framed such that the inevitable market in contraband cigarettes would be treated as the failure of the program, and so would be no more successful than the War On Drugs. This whole answer is based on speculation about how a "war on obesity" or "war on smoking", so named, would likely be handled by the US government as it contingently exists; I am not claiming any abstract distinctions between the various realms of human behavior that these different "wars" would seek to affect. 

An autonomy/consent perspective strongly distinguishes this scenario from assisted suicide. You do not generally forfeit your right to bodily autonomy just by doing something that's dangerous or that you mean to die from, and shooting the falling man might interfere with some way in which he was exercising autonomy-- you might keep him from being remembered as someone who wholly chose the moment of his death, or you might deprive him of a few seconds of weightlessness that he had intended to be his last experience. Of course, you also might NOT be interfering with that, but you don't know, whereas an accomplice (partner?) in assisted suicide is arguably acting to support the dying person's autonomy. (One good elaboration of this argument is Ronald Dworkin's "Life's Dominion".) I'll mention two ways in which I think you do forfeit some autonomy by attempting suicide, though I'm not sure either one matters here. One, you might be reducing the weight of your interests in any kind of balancing that has to be done; if your suicide is going to break someone else's leg (which jumping off a building might!) then atomizing you with a ray gun on the way down is probably more than justified even if it thwarts an exercise of your autonomy. Two, if your suicide looks like an accident, good samaritans will probably feel free to do all kinds of bodily invasive things to save you, if they think you can be saved, and I think that this is reasonable by most people's lights. (There are plenty of philosophers who would say that preventing a suicide is an act of good samaritanship even if you know the person wanted to die. But plenty of others would disagree, and it depends among other things on whether life is an intrinsic good, which is a whole other kettle of fish.) 

One part of your argument seems to be: Premise 1: There has been little consensus among philosophers at any given time in the last few thousand years. (Implicit) premise 2: If there is little consensus at any given time, then the objective truth hasn’t yet been discovered. (Inductive) premise 3: If the objective truth, despite thousands of years, hasn’t yet been discovered by philosophy, then the objective truth can’t be discovered by means of philosophy. Conclusion: The objective truth can’t be discovered by means of philosophy. (Note: I doubt that Premise 1 is truer of philosophy than of many other disciplines (history, literary criticism, anthropology etc.); European and Near Eastern philosophers from c. 600 to c. 1600 AD had a consensus that God existed; contemporary analytic philosophers have a consensus that there are no such things as Platonic forms.) To say some proposition P is true is to say (unless you're a paraconsistent logician or some other strange beast) that any set of propositions including a proposition equivalent to not-P is false. So any discipline that makes statements can be characterised as 'negative', as you say, in a sense. But you seem to mean (sometimes) the stronger thesis that philosophy is only ever negative – that the propositions with which philosophy is concerned are all members of exactly one of two sets, one non-empty set containing propositions whose truth-value we can't determine (if this set were empty then we'd be able to know the objective truth, contradicting your premise), and another set containing propositions whose truth-values we can determine, and which all happen to be false. But this isn’t possible. To say that a proposition P is false is to rule out certain possibilities. But it is also to affirm the truth of certain others (such as P’s negation). If we rule out restricted composition and mereological nihilism, then we'd have to go with mereological universalism. But you also sometimes seem to mean neither thesis above, and instead that philosophy is just about finding better and worse arguments, where better and worse admit of degrees, rather than merely sound or unsound arguments, where soundness doesn’t admit of degrees. Whether this is true or not is empirical – depending on what philosophers actually do or have done. If it is true, we might explain it in two ways. We might, as you suggest, say that philosophy is a sort of holding basket discipline from which other fields emerge when the foundational questions are resolved – quite a popular view these days. We might also (and not in contradiction with the first way) say that philosophy is the discipline concerned with fundamental beliefs, emotions, intuitions, perceptions etc., which are often radically incoherent (I have a feeling this can also be turned into an argument against intelligent design). Like any rational discipline, philosophy is also concerned with achieving rational consistency. We might think, then, that it is a peculiar feature of philosophy (or maybe the humanities in general) that we do want to be more coherent but we don't want to be 'most' coherent, or more coherent or 'right' beyond a certain extent, because that would require us to abandon too much of what we care about. (As an example, moral nihilism is the most coherent meta-ethical theory; but we'd rather have the inconsistencies and complexities and consequently inevitable lack of rational consensus of non-nihilist ethics than the simple coherence of nihilism.)
