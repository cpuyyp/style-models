The United States employs 284,000 people to make toys for the US (plus more for export). The US market is roughly a quarter of the worldwide toy market. So roughly one million people. Figure that only half the toys are for Christmas and only half of those are from Santa. So 250,000 people. Now just adjust for the relative productivity of elves versus humans. Do elves work around the clock? That's twenty shifts per week compared to five for a human. So let's call it 62,500 elves. I'll leave it up to you if you want to give them more of an advantage than a 160-hour work week. Extra speed? Or maybe you want them to be able to do less than humans? Adjust as necessary. 

Looking at the Brexit vote in particular, I'm not sure that this would matter. The particular problem with the Brexit vote wasn't that people didn't know what the EU was. The main problem was that voters didn't believe the consequences that were threatened if Brexit passed. But to prevent that, you would have to essentially allow the anti-Brexit people to write the voting test. There are two problems with letting anti-Brexit write that test. First, if Brexit had failed because of pro-Brexit voters being disenfranchised by a voting test, it wouldn't have drawn off the pro-Brexit anger. It would have let it not only fester but grow. All those people regretting their pro-Brexit votes would be angry about not being able to vote. They'd be even more pro-Brexit than previously. The second problem is for other votes. Maybe you are anti-Brexit and happy enough to have the establishment stomp it. But what happens when it's your side that wants something that gets blocked by the test? Will you simply be happy that your side fell to the more informed side? Or will you be angry too? Now there are groups of angry voters who want to get rid of this undemocratic voting test. There are two possibilities. The first is better. There are enough voters opposed to the test that it gets voted out. The second is that people are just plain angry. What happens when people feel powerless and angry? They resort to violence. The great thing about democracy is that it allows people to feel that if they could only convince others to vote with them, change is possible. If people learn that that is impossible, then we go back to the old way of changing government: violent revolution. 

The latter is already becoming true. People are moving between countries at higher and higher rates. Religious affiliations of none or unaffiliated are increasing. So you can just extend current trends. The former is different per country. Some of the larger economies, like China and Japan have weak antitrust already. The US varies between periods of strong and weak enforcement. Also note that companies can evade restrictions through organic growth. Google, Amazon, and Facebook are quite dominant in their areas. Network effects are already reinforcing the advantages of large companies. All you really need is to come up with a reason why China wins. For example, China could be become the new US. Using a mix of corporate, development, and military aid to bind other countries closer to it. Chinese corporations expand from China to Africa, South America, and Southern Asia. I don't know that that is what will happen, but it is at least a plausible story line. It's what some people in China are trying to make happen. Maybe they're right that they can. 

The important question here is what else is worth trading. Bottle caps are a fiat currency, like paper money is when not backed by a commodity. If no one is guaranteeing them, then they would tend to get replaced by a commodity. Fiat money is supported by governments, which require payment in that currency. For example, US taxes need to be paid in dollars. This gives people a direct reason to accumulate dollars. Plus there is an indirect reason in that you can easily trade them to people who need dollars. In your scenario, there is only an indirect reason to accumulate bottle caps. It is likely that other commodities with a greater intrinsic value would take over more and more of the trading. It's been a while since I've played Fallout, so I don't have a great in-universe suggestion. Since it is located in a desert, water seems like a possibility. Steel, gunpowder, and batteries are other examples of potential currencies due to the high need for weapons. None of those are light enough to make good currencies, so a paper substitute is likely. The first banking organization to issue paper certificates for such a commodity or commodities might well become the new broker of trade and replace the Brotherhood. What else does the Brotherhood buy? From the description, it sounds like technology, metal, and fuel. If, for example, the Brotherhood will take as much uranium as you provide, that would be a good currency. Remember that the most important characteristic of a currency is that it be easy to trade for things that you want. So if gold is something that you can always find someone willing to take, then it's a good currency. Same thing for pieces of paper, cigarettes, or bottle caps. You suggest that you want to create a world where the dominant currency changes. You can do this by switching from one party that guarantees to always take the currency to another. In Fallout, the Brotherhood will always take bottle caps, so people will accumulate bottle caps under that promise. In another universe, you'd need different organizations to step up as the currency guarantor. Without more details as to the actual situation, I can't be more specific. 

You don't need written language to discuss complex or abstract ideas. You need written language to store the complex or abstract ideas so that others can access them and build more complex ideas on top of them. Color is as complex if not more complex than sound. Our written language is not more complex than our spoken language, merely more persistent. Consider the difficulties if someone had to read to you every book that you want to read. That's an oral tradition. Not having a storable language is more of an issue than color versus sound. Note that braille and Morse code are fully capable of expressing anything in our language. Yet both are essentially two state languages. Raised/smooth for braille and long/short for Morse (perhaps silence is a third state). It's not clear to me why they wouldn't be able to store language. Can't they just make little cephalopod statues as their equivalent of cave paintings? I'm struggling to understand why they wouldn't have a stored language. They already have the concept of a visual language. They just need to put the appearance on something other than themselves. A written language would seem more natural under those circumstances than under ours. I wonder if there is a cephalopod somewhere wondering if sapience could develop in creatures with purely sound-based language. How would such things learn to store sounds rather than a simpler visual language? 

Why would you? If we take the population density up to that of New York City, then your city could support a million people. But where do you get food for a million people post-apocalypse? Rather than walling off forty square miles of city, wall off less than a square mile of town and a much larger area of farms around it. So the central area is defensible at night while the larger area can be cleared and defended during the day. You want the entire larger area to be within an hour or so of the central area. So people can leave the central area and reach the outskirts of the larger area in a reasonable commute. That gives you a larger area of around thirty square miles (assuming a walking radius of about three miles). You wouldn't want to start with a city for this, as the city will have paved over the good growing area. You'd be much better off starting with a small town (or even something like a hotel with a few supporting buildings). Houses and city infrastructure are easy to find. What's hard to find is food. For the kind of small communities that you'd actually have, you don't need a city. If you were in a city, you'd need to leave before you had time to do things like build walls. 

In-universe It often doesn't matter. When you're actually in space, there are a couple shapes that are useful and many more that are serviceable. 

So males are more dominant than females, making this a patriarchal society. Both males and females are older (on average) than asexuals. Some asexuals might be more dominant than females. If so, they would tend to be promoted. Promotions bring them into contact with males, which causes them to become female. So females will generally be more dominant than asexuals (with some youthful exceptions). It would seem that males would dominate both females and asexuals. Due to age, females would tend to dominate asexuals, but not always. If you want your species to be dominated by females or asexuals, you should change the criteria for sexual changes. For example, you could change the criteria for male to being aggressive rather than dominant. That would be in keeping with the role that you describe as protective. If you want the asexuals to be in charge, you might make the females the more submissive of the asexuals. The older asexuals would be the ones who dominate their own impulse to become female. Then the remaining asexuals would be the most dominant. The males would be aggressive but submit to the judgment of the asexuals, as they were all submissive females at one time. Without some mechanism like that, the females will tend to dominate the asexuals. The natural thing would be for the old to dominate the young. Since females never become asexual and asexuals become female based purely on a physiological reaction, the females will tend to be older than the asexuals. So females should generally dominate the asexuals. If you change things so that males aren't the most dominant, this would leave females in charge. So as described, males would dominate females who would tend to dominate asexuals. By changing the parameters a bit, you could pick any of the groups to be in charge. 

Maybe, but this wouldn't get you there. A 70% tax rate hurts poor people more than rich people. If a poor person needs \$200 a week to pay bills (housing, food, utilities, etc.) but only makes \$500 a week, then a 70% tax leaves them without enough money to buy basic subsistence (only \$150 a week). Yes, the rich person might pay more in absolute terms, but in proportional terms, they will pay the same rate. And the thing is, that rich people have more discretionary income. That's why rich people spend their money on extra houses and private planes, because they can afford it. Someone making \$100,000 a week would still have \$30,000 a week left. Such a person remains rich even after taxes. It's also worth noting that this is an income tax, but being rich is a function of wealth. It's quite possible for someone who is rich to have no income. They can live off their wealth and pay zero tax. A poor person does not have that option. The real difference here is that it is much easier for low tax people to become rich. If you have two people with the same income but one has a tax of 20% while the other has a tax of 70%, one of them will find it much easier to save for the future. If you want to incent rich people more than poor people, which is how I read your question, you should use a wealth tax rather than an income tax. Note that wealth taxes can be much lower than income taxes. The equivalent of a 70% income tax would be a 7% wealth tax. Rates like 10% or 20% are huge and would allow for large reductions, down to 2% for example (rough equivalent of a 20% income tax). You also may want to consider offering certain exemptions per person. For example, the first \$10,000 of income or \$100,000 of wealth could be exempt from taxation. This would make service less of a necessity for the poor and more of an option, as it is for the rich. Note: numbers given are in magnitudes reasonable for the US. Presumably there are equivalent numbers for other societies, but the US is what I know. Note that a minimum-wage, full-time job pays \$290 a week in the US (national rate; may be higher locally). 

If you gave everyone in the US \$70,000 then some would save it. Others would immediately consume it. Since this money is currently all savings, this means that there would be a drop in savings and investment. The stock market would crash, as a substantial portion of the stocks are included in the liquidated wealth. Note that eliminating the rich means that there's no longer anyone to buy that much stock. But then it's no longer \$70,000 per person. Let's look at the specific case of Donald Trump. He's worth about \$3 or \$4 billion and has about 10% of that in cash-like investments (mostly things like stocks and bonds still). The bulk of his wealth is in the form of real estate. So you take all his real estate and sell it. To whom? You'd end up selling mansions for middle class prices because no one could pay mansion prices. But then what happens to the market for normal houses? Why pay \$500,000 for an expensive house when you could buy a mansion for that? So the \$500,000 house becomes worth \$200,000 and the \$200,000 houses become worth \$100,000. So someone with a \$200,000 mortgage is now \$100,000 underwater. There goes that windfall. The construction market bottoms out. People are better off buying existing housing than new housing. This causes a recession. Perhaps they could go work in a factory instead -- there'll be a lot more consumption in that first year. For the one year where they collected the taxes on the windfall income, the government would do really well. The second year the government would lose 20% of its income tax revenues. Why? That's how much the 1% pay. So either the government would have to increase tax rates or cut spending. You might argue that the government could bank the excess from the first year. OK, but then you can't also spend it on new social programs. You'd also lose most estate tax revenues. Fortunately that's not much money. Homelessness After a year or so, there would be fewer jobs in this scenario because the consumption bump is a one-time thing. Homelessness might well increase. Remember that homelessness is as much of a mental health issue as a poverty issue. Many probably wouldn't ever figure out how to collect their money. And if they did collect their money, there's a strong chance that they'd drink it or otherwise waste it. There would of course be some success stories. But the mostly likely effect for most is that in five years they'd be in the same situation. And don't forget, the rich also provide a significant portion of the charitable donations. All that is gone. New businesses In the first year a bunch of people would start new businesses. But there would be no way to take them to the next level. All the angel investors are in the 1%. No stars in movies You wouldn't recognize anyone in a movie or TV show. All the stars would be gone. And that assumes that we could make movies and TV shows. You know who's in the 1%? Directors, producers, and actors. There may be some unsuccessful directors and actors who could step up. But for most, there are probably reasons why they have been unsuccessful. And there go the major league sports teams. And popular authors. And rock stars. Loss of production We'd also take some strong hits in areas like healthcare. The 1% would take the doctors. We'd be left with nurses and interns. But the decreased life expectancy should help make up the shortfall in Medicare spending. But that's not all of it. We make fun of rich businesspeople, but they are doing things. If they suddenly stop doing those things, it can make a difference. We can promote a bunch of people, at least in those cases where the rich business person is not the sole owner as well. But we should expect some loss of production from the loss of experience. Inflation Loss of production combined with increased consumption causes inflation. Politics I'm not convinced that money in politics is the be all and end all. First, the largest recipient ever was Barack Obama. Are you arguing that getting rid of the 1% would make the US more Republican? Second, there have been several cases of the better funded candidate losing. Another problem is that this would get rid of large individual donors and leave large corporate donors. In some ways, that's less balanced, not more. 

Landing When you get to your destination, you don't know how much fuel you'll be able to get. So you have to carry landing fuel with you. Rather than carrying enough fuel for multiple trips, just land the whole thing. Once on the ground, you can easily go to and from the ship. You can walk. No fuel needed. Use solar panels, etc. and charge up the batteries on wheeled or tracked vehicles. Refueling I remember one of the old RPGs (Traveller?) had a streamlined option. They used it to fly down into a gas giant or ocean and refuel the fusion reactor. Without that, you had to buy fuel at a space station, which doesn't work so well for a generation ship. The point here is that if you get to the target star and can't find a suitable planet, this could help you move to the next star system.
