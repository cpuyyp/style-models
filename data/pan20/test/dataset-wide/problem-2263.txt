Liam's right that you can't/shouldn't overhydrate, but based on my experience it's easily possible to start the day under-hydrated. Maybe you're office-bound and don't drink enough water, or you've had a spot more alcohol the evening before than you should, or too much coffee... Either way, you start walking under-hydrated, and end up drinking more water than expected early in the day. If I'm doing a day hike, I tend to take a 1 or 2 litre water bottle in the car (in addition to what I'm walking with...), and use this to improve hydration as I drive/before I start walking. Whatever's left in the bottle is great to rehydrate with when you return to the car. 

If you're out of the water and wet, you will lose heat by evaporation (as well conduction and convection), so dry clothing and dry body are important. 

"list" questions can cause problems on stackexchange sites, but, anyhow... From a UK perspective, Robert Macfarlane's "The Wild Places" is excellent. 

They are marked on OS 1:25K Explorer maps as "Byways open to all traffic". But it's a good idea to research your route beforehand as some (like the Monk's Trod) are now closed by traffic regulation orders - primarily because of the damage caused by off-roaders. 

In European campgrounds, it is common that there is a kitchen shelter with a freezer, where people who camp without electricity can freeze their ice packs, in order to subsequently use those with cool bags for refrigeration. The Parks Canada website for Gros Morne National Park indicates that each of the frontcountry campgrounds has a kitchen shelter. Does such a kitchen shelter typically have a freezer with the aforementioned purpose? 

¹With some areas still permitting some leave-no-trace mountaineering, it would be sad if we couldn't enter any mountain ever anymore. 

What is a self erecting tent? What are the advantages of a self erecting tent as opposed to a tent that isn't, and what are the disadvantages? 

Normally, the gulf stream means that at Å i Lofoten, Norway, temperatures usually don't drop far below 0°C, but on the early morning of 27 March 2008, it was the coldest night of the year at -7°C. If you're worried that falling asleep may be lethal, I would simply not even try to sleep. Get out of your tent, eat, pick up your tent and walk away. Hopefully you brought some decent headlight, but even if not, as long as you're walking, even just back and forth or in circles around your tent, you can keep warm and you won't fall asleep. You'll get very tired, but being tired is not lethal, and perhaps during the day it gets warm enough to sleep safely. 

Hypothermia is likely the least of your problems after an involuntary dip into icy water. Drowning and cardiac arrest are the killers here. Read these, and maybe watch the videos. It's all good stuff, and difficult to summarise. $URL$ $URL$ Basically, adults need over 30 mins in icy water before you get even mildly hypothermic. From beyondcoldwaterbootcamp: 

...and the second showing effect of different clothing. In this test with 10degC water, subject (wearing 'street' clothes) had core temperature of 35.6degC after 30 minutes. 

It Depends. Actually, it depends on pretty much everything: Weather, terrain, fitness, group size, and of course, how long a day is. It's better to think of 'How much can I do in an hour, and how many hours do I want to walk/climb for?'. I'd start using Naismith's Rule. But, as you get experience about your own group's speed and fitness, adjust it up or down as appropriate. 

I know that's all bit of a leap, but if you had a problem our running in remote country and had to wait for rescue, having all your layers soaked with sweat is giong to be pretty uncomfortable. 

One of the biggest problems I have keeping warm in the cold are my shoes. When I'm out cycling in temperatures below -20°C, ordinary sport-shoes or hiking boots fail to keep me warm 

Edit: Finally, it was less useful than I hoped. Firstly, the scale is not nearly good enough for outdoor use, and I was unable to find some of the hotsprings listed. Secondly, a hotspring is not yet a hotpool. A bit of hot water coming out of the muddy ground is a nice curiosity. But only when someone has built a pool around it does it become an extraordinary backcountry luxury. The map is a good starting point for the latter, but it's not quite enough. 

The Navajo National Monument website notes that Betatakin can only be visited on a ranger-guided tour. It states that groups leave daily between May 27 and September 3, and cliff dwellings are closed from October through April. We will pass through the area May 13–14. Is it possible to visit Betatakin during this period? 

FWIW, I used a short NeoAir mat (with the platformat from my OMM pack under the feet), PHD Minum 500 down Bag, TarpTent Scarp 1. I left my lighter Marmot Atom bag at home, which I think was the right call. 

Here's one study: $URL$ And a couple of snippets, the first showing how water cools faster than air. In this test with 10degC water, subject's core temperature was still over 36degC after approx 40 minutes. 

IANAL, but... The riverbed is owned by the landowner (although the water isn't), so removing rocks (or any other item) from the riverbed is the same as removing them from anywhere else on the land. In other words, it's probably theft, so NOT legal. If you're concerned about it, ask the landowner's permission. Also note that the CROW act is pretty restrictive about what you can do in rivers and lakes even when they're on access land. No boating or bathing... : $URL$ 

On a backpack, you'd have the quick-release buckle, but no clasp. The clasp is really doing two things - stopping the buckle loosening, and making it look tidy. If the buckle is decent quality and condition it's unlikely to loosen much by itself in normal use. I'd just remove the clasp, and shorten the webbing as much as possible (which helps keep it tidy). Carefully melt the cut end of the webbing to stop it fraying. 

Although the train is not a typical mode of transportation in North America, is it quite suitable for an outdoor vacation in combination with car rental. You're not limited much in the amount or type of stuff to take, you get to experience the distance and see the country, and you can get closer to most national parks than by air. Compared to driving, it saves time, because the train continues day and night. We took a train from Toronto, Ontario to Salinas, California, then a bus to Monterey. From there we had a one-way car rental to Los Angeles, camping at the Big Sur and at Channel Islands National Park on the way (possibly the most underrated national park in the USA; see above). Then we took a train from Los Angeles to El Paso, from where we had a one-way car rental to San Antonio, while visiting White Sands National Monument, Carlsbad Caverns National Park, and Big Bend National Park (we could have camped there, but it was winter and we decided to take a cabin, which was for the best because it turned out a serious winter storm was coming). From San Antonio we took the train back to the Great Lakes area. It was a very memorable vacation and we did not enter an aeroplane once. 

If you're staying out overnight, consider digging a snowhole instead of using a tent. A snowhole can be much warmer than a tent and give significantly better protection. And, as Andy Kirkpatrick writes, they can't blow away. 

For compasses, it will depend on the model. You can get globally balanced compasses like the Suunto M3 Global, but Silva compasses (probably the most common in Europe) tend to be balanced for the Northern Hemisphere. As LBell says, they'll point the right way, but just won't work smoothly so you run the risk of taking inaccurate bearings. It's worth looking at a declination map to understand the scale of the problem. We're not talking just a degree or two out. Large parts of the world are 20 degrees or more away from polar north. Another point: when you correct for declination, you need to correct from magnetic north to GRID north (which will not be the same as polar, and the difference will vary according to your location on the grid - as well as over time). Some smartphone apps (e.g. Eclipsim's GPS Status) can help by using GPS to determine location, and then lookup using declination map data to give the required correction. You can then set your compass accordingly and switch off the phone. Good background material here and here. 

The reward: Covão dos Conches, entrance to Middle Earth? The following morning, the weather was poor. This was the stretch where snowshoes would have been most useful, as I walked through the snow continuously for a couple of hours. However, it was entirely passable without snowshoes. 

This year, a Danish citizen went missing without a trace in the mountains of northern Sweden. It is not the first time; in total, ten people are registered as missing after venturing into the mountains of the Swedish county of Norrbotten, including two this year (a Polish citizen in May, and a Danish one in August). This Swedish language article describes the story of several of them. One is the story of two Polish citizens in Sarek National Park, who went missing in the 1990s. One of the less esoteric theories is that they may have disappeared into quicksand. The local Sami inhabitants know about quicksand in the area, as it occasionally kills some of their reindeer. Quicksand might have killed one or more of the missing people — but it is far from certain. Suppose I am hiking by myself in a remote wilderness. How can I minimise the risks of disappearing into quicksand? Can I somehow recognise quicksand in order to avoid it? If I don't recognise it and do get stuck, what can I do to get out? Fortunately, the risk is probably very small, isn't it? 

I've heard that leaving the jacket in a car on a hot day, or carefully using a hairdryer on it will improve the DWR without the risks involved in ironing. 

I can't answer the rest, but for here's my 2c worth for gloves. Layering : As with other clothes, layering gloves is worth doing. I'd try fairly thin liner gloves inside either mitts or a larger glove than you'd normally wear. This gives an extra layer of insulation, but also means you can just take the outer layer off when you need more dexterity than mitts allow. Mitts have an advantage that there's less 'surface area' around each finger so they can stay warmer. Also they allow warmer parts of the hand (palms) to conduct heat to colder parts (fingers) if you make a fist inside the them. 

Based on last Wednesday (May 16th) in the Carneddau (Snowdonia, N Wales), I'd be well prepared for temperatures below freezing at night in Scotland, even in May. I camped at Ffynnon Llyffant (at about 820m) and the temperature inside the tent was no more than 4 degrees C (measured by suunto core, suspended in tent), and when I got out of the tent in the morning there was around 1-2cm of snow covering it, and it was snowing down to about 700m. Obviously it depends on how high you plan to camp (subtract 1-2 degrees C per 300m). Anyway, specific recommendations, some obvious:-
