Firstly I want to congratulate you on your resolve. Yours is twice the weight (90 kg x 2) of a normal heavy rider. I see that bike you mentioned is a very cheap bike. For your safety DON'T!!!!. I can recommend that you do a LOT of searching online about bikes for heavy people, find examples that have worked for people at or above your specific size and weight. Here is one very interesting blog by someone who lost weight and "reclaimed" health through bicycle riding: $URL$ He recommends a 29er with fat slick tires for road use. It sounds good. You will notice he mentions $5000 to $6000 dollars as a price tag but I think it doesn't need to be that much. "Surley" ($URL$ is a US company that makes sturdy steel bikes at a reasonable price. (I am planning to get a Surley for my next bike). They have contact information on their web page. I hope they are as friendly as their website looks, and they would give you the info about what bike would suit your needs. Then you could go to a LBS which is a Surely dealer to get the bike you want and have already confirmed would suit you, who could also help get the details right like the right kind of saddle. I guess you could do it with budget of $2000 US. I'm 80 kg and I have a scar above my left eye that tells me that "cheapest" does not make sense when choosing a bike. Even more so for you. Good luck dude! 

Is the front derailleur on straight and at the right height? Set the limits all the way out and check again with the bike on a stand. If that doesn't work, then while leaving the limits all the way out, take off the chain, and look closely to see how far the derailleur moves compared to the crankset gap. If its about the same then your problem is NOT solved. But if they are clearly different, then you know the problem is in how much the shifters are moving the derailleur. You're probably thinking "impossible"! But the last 9 speed MTB rear derailleur I bought turned out to have that problem. Finally, I found that if I put the cable on the other side of the screw, where there was no groove and it clearly wasn't intended to go, it worked perfectly because that changed the pull ratio just right. I never figured out why it was like that, but I am guessing that either it was dual 9 speed/10 speed, with 9 speed relegated to poor side of the screw and no explanation, or I got a wrongly labeled product. Having got it to work, I kept it, and it's still going strong after several months. You never know. 

As Carel says - there are limit screws to prevent the chain from going out of range. It is important to set those limits correctly or the chain will fall off. Did the LBS not check the limit settings? Even with a new chain and new correctly set derailleur, the chain can and will jump off the sprocket if the limit screws are not set properly. In the high gears (7 and 8 as you say) the chain will inevitably have more slack. If the limit screw is not set, the front derailleur will momentarily go too far out when you change the front gear from lo to hi (inside to outside). It is also true that any of chain, cassette, sprocket, derailleur, etc., could be involved - when any component is not in good condition the margin of error for the other components may be exceeded. So yes you should check your chain as the chain is usually the first component to wear out, especially if it is not cleaned and lubricated thoroughly every N miles (or every M months whichever comes first). If your chain is already worn out, then you will need to replace the cassette as well. Front sprockets can usually survive longer being used with a worn chain, but the cassette is usually a goner. 

If the chain is skipping after replacing the chain, then it is almost certainly a matter of cassette wear. If you don't replace the cassette immediately, the new chain will also experience accelerated wear. Most freehubs are made of aluminum, which is light, cheap, and soft. Some seems softer than others. Also, manufacturing with higher tolerances is also cheaper. The result is movement of the cogs, especially when the cogs are all separate pieces. When the cogs dig into the freehub, they can be difficult to remove. Tightening beyond the recommended 50 N/m (say to 70 N/m) can he helpful in controlling the digging, but there may be drawbacks as well .... With a steel freehub, digging will not occur. 

Difficult to judge the product as a bicycle - no test ride, no company reputation, no customer reports on the internet. What does differentiate it is a not particularly astounding cycling computer which happens to be built in. There they seem to bucking the trend: bicycle makers specializing in bicycles, electronic device and software makers specializing in their crafts. As if it is already not hard enough to make something distinctive and competitive in either sphere. 

The ways in which exercise in general promotes good health is generally well understood and appreciated and shared between athletes. However, the adverse affects can vary greatly between individuals and is often overlooked, ignored, and can even become a source of shame and feelings of inadequacy. That is not good! and a logical-medical viewpoint, balancing the benefits and not-so-benefits, must be maintained. My personal story - I used to jog and suffered from unknown leg pains, inability to sit without pain for more than 15 minutes, increasingly slow running, etc. - finally had an MRI and could see with my own eyes the slipped disc. Fortunately, the direction of the slip meant that I could cycle without pain so I quit running and took up cycling. The pain in my legs disappeared after a year. I can cycle for endless hours whereas I could run for no more than three hours before the pain became too great. Then I had trouble with sebaceous cysts on my behind after randonneur mega-rides. In the end I had two operations to have cysts removed over 3 years. After optimizing saddles, riding position, pedals, bib shorts, chamois, chamois creme, and removing pork and beef and minimizing other animal fats and sugar in my diet (animal fats replaced with coconut oil), I can with a confidence of 99% get through a 600 km ride without ass/crotch pimples that might become sebaceous cysts later. How this applies to your question: Don't ignore your symptoms treat them with respect and keep actively changing parameters to test how the symptoms can be minimized. Nothing is guaranteed, but you are allowed to try. Opportunist bacteria in the crotch is likely to increase during cycling due to heat and friction - in the case of a woman there is a direct large channel from the crotch to the bodies interior so it makes sense that (depending on the individual) bladder infections could increase. That doesn't mean you are defeated however, there are many possible parameter changes that might help you overcome this obstacle. 

That's not normal - any knock is also going to accelerate wear so you must fix it soon. Did you loosen the stem bolts before tightening down the headclamp? See [1]. The tightening order is the same for all materials, but the torques are vastly different. The torque range is usually 4-8 Nm for the head clamp for carbon forks, similar for stem clamps. You can use a special carbon grease to increase friction to that you succeed at low torques. See [2] Does it have a couple of years or more of wear on it? Head clamps wear out. Head clamps for carbon frames are remarkably skimpy things. [1] $URL$ [2] Attaching a stem to a carbon steerer: how much torque? 

Looking over all the very good answers I noticed one important omission. That is: inherent in the setup of most(*) front cantilever brakes is the potential for horrendous brake shudder. (I recently changed from cantilever to v-brakes on a road tandem just for this very reason, and it was very effective!) Lennard Zinn explains the mechanics of it here: 

Besides grips and handle sweep (affecting wrist angle), you might want to consider bike fit (esp. seat fore-aft position, handlebar height, and length of stem) which greatly affect how much weight you put on your hands. Generally speaking, seat further back, handlebars higher, and stem shorter will have you putting less weight on your hands. However, beware, as this may put more weight on your ass which may then get very sore. Imagine you are pedaling so hard that the downward force of your feet is strong enough to lift your whole weight - then if your center of mass is balanced over the pedals you will be touching your seat and the handles just enough to keep you balanced, not using either to carry your weight. The problem is, unless you are a really fast racer going out for a 1 or 2 hour spin, you can't pedal that hard for long so your ass and hands have to carry the weight. This is why long distance riders tend to put their handlebars a little higher and get a leather saddle. I do some long distance mixed terrain MTB riding. I use a Brooks leather saddle and have put aerobars on my MTB. The point of the aerobars is not to go faster (although that helps a little on the road sections) but to have an alternate position. Once any part of your posture becomes too tired or painful, it really starts to slow you down. 

The seat tube is generally fixed at 17 deg for all bike sizes. Because you can adjust saddle height, the relation between bottom bracket and saddle does not depend upon bike size. However, if your femur is very long in relation to your tibia, I could see how you might need to move your saddle back. It is worth noting that most riders are able to temporarily exert more power by moving forward on the saddle ("riding on the rivets"). Having your saddle too far back precludes that position. 

Even though I am commenting long after the this question is already answered, I think it is worthwhile to point out some safety information. The pins of modern 9 speed and up chains are mushroomed at the ends to prevent prying the chain apart with lateral force when changing gears. Because of this, not only should pins no longer be re-used, but the bushings are also damaged by removing the pin, so should not be reused. Therefore, when adjusting a pin at a stuck link, one should consider both whether the bushing may have been compromised, and if it may become compromised by loosening the pin. As a reference to back up this thinking please see: $URL$ The application is slightly different and the info old, but I think it is valid to apply it to the case of stuck links as well. The conclusion is that removing the outer plates at a stuck link and replacing with a KMC "missing link" or equivalent is a safe solution.
