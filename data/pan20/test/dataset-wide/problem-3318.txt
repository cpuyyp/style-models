Cognitive semantics strives to reduce regularities about meaning (in the broadest sense) to informal and non-grammatical facts about cognition, and formal semantics attempts to give a symbolic and grammatical account of a proper subset of that sense of "meaning". Per se, they are logically exclusive, though a formal semanticist can accept the functional explanations proposed by cognitive semanticists for why meaning properties in language are what they are, and still maintain their theories of what they are in grammar. 

The word "need" here is a bit strong. Imbabura Quechua is head-final like Japanese, but verbs in relative clauses still have special nominalization marking (wambra-ca runa-ta ricu-rca-mi "The child saw the man" vs. wambra ricu-shca runa "the man who the child saw", runa = "man"). Special morphology on the verb of the relative clause is not "needed" and wambra ricu-rca runa would be perfectly interpretable, except that it's a fact of Quechua (and not Japanese) that relative clauses have special marking. There is a split in Bantu between languages which require an initial head-marking complementizer for subject relative clauses, and those that don't. In those that don't there is the potential for ambiguity between "a man who bought a cow" and "a man bought a cow" – but ambiguity is avoided because (using Shona as an example) the tone of subject agreements in the two clause types tells you whether you have a relative clause vs. a main clause (thus munhu akáténgá n'ómbe "a man who bought a cow" vs munhu ákaténgá n'ómbe). Kerewe is a language that requires special head-marking on the verb which in fact differs between subject relatives and non-subject relatives: and furthermore subject relatives and object relatives have different tone patterns, thus a-yábwééne "he who saw" vs. owó yabwééné "whom he saw" (head markers are in bold). Distinct tone patterns are not needed when there are distinct head-marking prefixes; distinct head-marking prefixes are not needed when tone patterns distinguish subject vs. object relative clauses. I would say that "need" is not an informative concept for understanding how relative clauses are structured. The direction that one should be looking is for languages that systematically do not mark relative clauses in any manner, and where there is no way to distinguish between "the man bought the cow" and "the man who bought the cow". If there are none, and this isn't just an attestation gap, then perhaps a case for "need" can be made. 

The consonant chart indicates a very rich set of consonants, including aspiration, glottalization, and glottalization of voiced stops, and a fairly limited vowel inventory. Bamileke languages have a relatively small consonant inventory (voiced / voiceless stops), and a rich vowel inventory (i ʉ u e o ə a ɑ, or similar arrangements). No Grassfields langauge is recorded as having glottalization. In fact, no Cameroonian language is recorded as having glotalized consonants. There are some Bantu languages spoken in Mozambique and South Africa which have glottalization, implosives, and a 5-vowel inventory, but even then, none has anything like the full inventory of segments reported in the present language. Glottalized consonants are found in Afro-Asiatic languages in the area of Ethiopia, but they do not have an aspiration contrast or any contrast among voiced consonants. Ejectives are also found in Khoisan languages of southern Africa, and !Xu is reputed to include [p t k ph th kh t' k' b d g b' d' g'] in its consonant inventory – however, it also has a huge number of clicks. Sandawe (Central Tanzania) has among others [p t k ph th kh b d g p' t' k'], so lacking one series, but it also has clicks (not as many as !Xu). Because implosives are rare and ejectives are rare, it's not difficult to sift through the language families of Africa to determine that no language has this inventory. If you eliminate various segments from the inventory, you widen the possibilities. If you reduce the set of consonants to [p,b], then it would well be any Grassfields language, including Kwa'. Without knowing which segments are felt to be most dubious, it's not possible to be more specific. If you go with just the name and country, it might be the Adamawa language Kuo, the Bamileke language Kwa', or the related Ring language Oku also known as Kuɔ. If you go with the name, country and reputed area of Cameroon, it must be Kwa', in which case you have to discount the gentleman's rejection of that identification. It is very likely that his rejection is based on confusion of local orthography versus general Wiki-type language name reports. Since Bamileke languages also have complex tone systems, it is relatively likely that apostrophe is used in a practical orthography (perhaps for tone, perhaps for representing vowel contrasts). Glottal stop is a common final consonant in the area, and we may presume that the spelling "Kwa'" means that it is called [kwaʔ]. Since we don't have any further information on the Bamileke dialect bko, all one can say at this point is that if we believe the geographical and naming claims, it is most likely bko. The linguistic claims have to be totally discounted. 

None of the above. The waveform display program shows the raw sampled numbers (not anything in decibels), but there can also be an intensity curve, in dB, superimposed on the waveform display. In Praat, the string of numbers that is the waveform is typically scaled to a real between -1 and 1, but underlyingly (in the input file) it is a 16 (or so) bit signed integer. The numbers are produced by the A-2-D converter, which maps varying input voltage to integers, and the microphone converts varying sound pressure into varying voltage. Thus, a unit of sound pressure level, defined here. 

Vowels can't be consonants. Consonants can't be vowels. However, consonants can do things that are more commonly observed with vowels, and vice versa. "Vowel" is specifically a description of the vocal tract constriction of the segment combined with the prosodic property of being a syllable peak ("syllabic"). When a vocalic (vowel-like) segment is not syllabic (thus is more like a consonant, since consonants are typically non-syllabic), it is termed a glide (or semivowel). 

IPA take no position on this, but there is a diacritic combined with t etc for "linguolabial" ([t̼]: t plus seagull). This is how the IPA chart deals with it, and it is what Ladefoged and Maddieson say in Sounds of the world's languages. IPA say nothing about an apico-labial. The term "apico-labial" is mentioned Sounds, but they note that they have no example of such a thing (that is, examples are not actually apical). Theoretically you might write [p̺], p plus inverted bridge, since the inverted bridge is the diacritic for "apical", but this would be trying to set a standard, rather than following a standard. 

I don't know what it means for stress or words to co-evolve. Most languages have relatively regular rule-governed stress systems, but Indo-European languages have more than their share of lexicalized systems such as found in English and Russian. The accent system of Proto-Indo European was rather messy, with morphological alternations and lexical classes as one finds in Lithuanian and Russian (some people even think it was a tone language of sorts). Various sub-groups regularized the system, hence Latin developed a regular right-end oriented system, and late Germanic developed initial accent. English then messed with that system to create the messier system that we have. The Romance languages tend towards a word-final position of stress because they derive from Latin and Latin had such a stress system. The Latin stress system was easy to learn, thus is was largely preserved in Romance, though the loss of vowel length distinctions and other factors resulted in some irregularity. The Indo-European system was hard to learn, and tended to get regularized in favor of a more transparent rule-based system, as it did in West Slavic. This is an instance of a general trend in historical change: lexically and grammatically arbitrary rules are harder to learn than regular phonological rules. 

Element Theory is an autosegmental theory of phonology coming from Government Phonology promulgated by Kaye, Harris, Lindsey, Rennison and others. The essential difference between a feature and an element is that a feature is not pronounceable on its own, but an element is. For example, [+low] cannot be pronounced by itself, but the element that sort of corresponds to [+low], namely A, can be – it's [a]. The three vowel elements, as far as I know, are A ("nonhigh"), I ("front"), U ("round"), and three of the consonant elements are H ("aspirated, voiceless"), N ("nasal, voiced", ʔ ("occluded"), and when not combined with anything, they are [a i u h n ʔ]. The combination of I and A is pronounced [e], [U] and [I] is [y]. Similarly, [p] is [U.ʔ.H]. There may also be an element "@" i.e. [ə], formerly called "the cold vowel", which is something like a neutrino (it doesn't interact with other things). The theory also includes a concept of "headedness" (usually indicated by underlining but notated here with italics), so that A.I is [ɛ] and [A.I] is [e] (essentially, the head properties are stronger than the no-head properties). I belive that the difference between [ts], [tʃ] and [tç] is that [ts] is [A.I.ʔ.H], [tʃ] is [A.I.ʔ.H] and [tç] is [A.I.ʔ.H]. 

The standard account of such patterns is to say that in sequences of [-continuant] segments, the first specification is deleted (because of the OCP). This leaves the first segment unspecified, whereupon it acquires the value [+continuant] by default. This is sketched in Odden 1987 "Dissimilation as Deletion in Chukchi" (ESCOL vol 3) and a longer unpublished paper of the period. The pattern of Greek is somewhat challenging, since it appears to necessitate a special default mechanism, since it is typically held that [-continuant] is the default value, not [+continuant], so additionally one might hold that the default value can be governed by the OCP. An alternative view is that this is actually a mix of assimilation and dissimilation, whereby stops acquire [+continuant] from the preceding sonorant – which however does not work for word-initial stop cluster. However, the synchronic evidence for application in initial clusters is, as I recall, non-existent. From a historical perspective (where the original two-stop analysis is oncontroversial), it is more likely that stops before stops become aspirated (a mechanism for enhancing identifiability of the first stop, found in Tsou as reported by Wright 1996), and aspirated stops then spirantize. 

Assuming the theory underlying Burt's red book, the deep structure would be "Neg the Tense cat eat the mouse". If that's not the theory you're using, you need to identify the theory. 

Are you familiar with Steiner 1977 The case for fricative-laterals in Proto-Semitic? The standard reasoning behind reconstructing a series of emphatic (or something'd) consonants lies in nonrandom distinctions in correspondences across branches of Semitic. There is a correspondence between Targum Aramaic ʕ and Arabic ḍ ("ill" = mraʕ (Aramaic). mariiḍ (Arabic)), in fact I think Old Aramaic kept all of the hypothesized PS consonants distinct. What is not at all clear is what the original phonetic value of the consonants were, so if Arabic emphatics derive from multiple sources (glottalization vs. lateral fricatives), then it would not be surprising to lose one but not the other.
