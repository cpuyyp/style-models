That said, when I have looked into it, bicycle insurance was comparatively expensive. It made far more sense for me to self insure the bicycle against theft/damage by creating a "new bike fund" and just paying myself. My health insurance covers me if I am injured. If you have significant assets, like a nice home and car, and you are worried about being sued for causing damage while bicycling, you could look into a general personal liability (umbrella) policy. Coverage for theft or damage to a rental bike you are using may be available when you rent the bike. In addition, many credit card issuers in the US have "purchase protection plans", but you would have to check with your card issuer regarding coverage. Liability coverage for damage or loss that you cause to others or other property would fall under an umbrella liability policy as above. 

I also like The Heart Rate Monitor Book for Cyclists for cycling specific workouts to improve speed and aerobic threshold. 

Tape one near where the wire leaves the battery, and another to where the wire lead plugs into the light. The can be found at stores like RadioShack for a few bucks. If the lights are wireless, aluminum and tin foil is an excellent reflector for this kind of Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI). The first step would be to see if foil will help. Try wrapping the outside of the lights with foil and repeating the tests you did before. I doubt you can add foil to the computer because this will interfere with it picking up the wireless signal from the sensors. If that reduces the interference you can tape the foil to the lights, carefully cutting away the foil around mounting brackets and buttons and see if the EMI is still reduced. If the lights can be easily disassembled you can try taking them apart and lining the interior with foil as well; take care not to short out the internal electronics. Good Luck. 

I have a large workbench with a bench vise mounted on it. I made a jig from a couple pieces of wood to hold the bike upside down, then I clamp the bike either high or low so it doesn't twist in the jig. This holds it in place, rock solid. 

A track bike has no brakes because braking would cause a pile up. When a fixie on the road has no brakes it is because someone is being macho. They will insist they can stop just as quickly or they can always see the road and path ahead. The former being easily disproven and the latter generally being optimistic. There seems to be a fair overlap with the same crowd that shuns helmets in traffic. I ride a fixie with two brakes (rear rarely used). The bike store near me sells fixed gear bikes set up for both track (no brakes, swept handlebars so as not to catch) and for road (with brakes and regular handlebars). 

You also have to consider that a motorcycle has no trouble accelerating to and maintaining traffic speeds. In short, a motorcycle really doesn't need to look backward with anywhere near the frequency that a cyclist does. They also have mirrors mounted on their bikes which most cyclists don't have. For example. Coming off a red light, anyone on a motorcycle can just go without consideration for anything behind them. Lane changes require major planning on a bicycle, but are relatively simple on a motorcycle traveling at matching speeds with all the cars. 

Try Aero Tech Designs. They have shorts, jerseys, outerwear and liners and go up to 6XL in many items and styles. The have large gloves as well (under accessories). As a guy who fluctuates between XL and XXL one recommendation I want to make is that you consider bib shorts. You can wear them under any kind of shorts if you don't want the lycra look. The primary advantage of bib shorts is that everything stays in place, rather than shifting, or in my case the waist band rolling down. 

While I like maintaining momentum, and recognize that I can see farther, sooner than motorists, I believe that being predictable is more important. 

Is there any bike insurance which covers both bike and life? The short answer to this is "yes". Is there any bike insurance which also covers rental biking? The short answer to this is "not that I know of". The longer answers... In general in the US, casualty (theft/loss), liability (payment to others when you are at fault), life, and health insurance are separate classes of policy. Many auto policies combine casualty and liability (and minimal health) coverage. Often in the US, theft or damage to your bicycle will be covered under a homeowners or renters policy. Unfortunately you will want to make sure that the coverage is very specific about actual value vs replacement value, deductible, depreciation, incident location, security requirements, etc. A common deductible amount is $250, and in a claim the adjuster would likely assess very rapid depreciation to a bicycle; 25-30% per year or more. So if your moderately priced bicycle is more than a few years old you would collect almost nothing on a claim. There are at least two companies in the United States that offer bicycle insurance plans that are similar in nature to motor vehicle insurance (Markel and Velosurance). Because companies and plans come and go, you should just use your preferred search engine for terms like "US Bicycle Insurance". The few specialized policies that are available differ significantly, so you would want to compare them closely. That said, you should be able to purchase policies in the US now that cover: 

If I had a single speed instead of fixed gear, I could do one thing that I really miss: Bunny hop a curb. That's something I've had to do more than once on a regular road bike just to avoid cars and it's something I do all the time on a variety of bikes just for convenience. For the life of me, I can't do it at more than a crawl with a fixie. I can shift weight over a pothole or the like, that's not too bad, but getting airborne is impossible for me. The Fixie keeps me off some of the types of locations I rode all the time in college: extensive sidewalks, railroad tracks, potholes, etc... Not a problem where I live, but it would have been years ago. 

You might get into the habit of inspecting your bike before you take off. I check the tires and the brakes every time I pull the bike off its rack. Check your cages along with it. Mentally I classify water along with protective gear, probably giving it more weight than a helmet. It isn't something that's merely nice to have because you're a little thirsty. It's something that stops me from having a stroke in the heat (and cramps when I'm done). Vaguely related. I keep $2 on my bike so I can buy a bottle of water if I have to. You could also place something in your cage that won't let you operate the bike after you get off it when you're done. It's easy to remember your water bottle at the end, because you're thirsty. Pick up the water bottle and place your pump or something in the cage so you have to pull it out and remember the water before you leave next time. My advice though is to treat water with the importance is has. 

Most US State and Local laws are based on the Uniform Vehicle Code and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) guidelines. They will normally have a phrase like: 

Among the bikes in my stable is a department store tandem that really isn't worth much, but would be enjoyable to ride with my wife. Like many department store bikes this one was not assembled correctly and now the pedal threads on the right front crank are beyond stripped, there are millimeters of smooth clearance around where it would screw in. It doesn't appear that it could be re-threaded. The problem is, on a normal bike the right crank has the splines for the chainrings, and the left is unadorned. On the front crank of a tandem this is backwards. So while I can find replacement left crank arms, what I really need is a plain 170 mm right crank arm. I've searched my usual online retailers to no avail - and don't want to spent the $$$ for a full, 4 crank arm tandem set. Anyone know where I might find one? 

There are a number of rubber overshoes that would work. Two of the most common brands are Totes and Tingley. Try a search for "rubber overshoes" on Google or Amazon. These will protect your shoes, provide some traction, and can be rolled up and strapped to the frame or seat with velcro. Below is an example of the Totes brand: 

There is a direct feel of the road. There is no slack going forward or backward before the "catch" on the chain. No derailleur maintenance. No clicking. No wait on gear shifts. No finding the right gear. Where I ride, it is completely flat, in and out of neighborhoods, constant speed changes. I could shift gears all the time, or I could just ride one gear and absorb it with my legs. It puts me out of my comfort zone. When I ride a regular road bike for fitness, the temptation is to pick the most efficient gear and go at the heart rate I can sustain for the distance I want to travel. All efforts are pretty much identical. With a fixie, the gear is picked and I must choose the effort expended to match the distance I'll travel. I don't really ride it for fitness but I've found it puts me through paces I never went through on a regular road bike. 

The biggest benefit I see is convenience. You can just hop onto a bike with whatever you're wearing at the time and go. Not a big deal if you're planning a 15 mile ride, but a real big deal if you're riding around the neighborhood, hopping off to run into a few stores, etc... It's also possible to pedal on the flip side of the pedal and get moving without the cumbersome and slow start up that is required to get into clipless or straps. In an emergency you can even stomp on the straps and move the bike out of the way. It's rare, but occasionally you find yourself standing there and just want to get out of the way, in any direction. I've now switched almost entirely to riding clipless though. Between that and riding fixed gear, it makes the bike feel so connected to me. To compare: Straps are easier to get into. Clipless are easier to get out of (really!). I've never pulled out of my clipless pedals, I have broken a strap (no big deal if you're not in a sprint). At this point if I'm riding any distance at all, I change shoes. If I'm just going to the store to pick up groceries, I don't even have straps, just old school pedals. The middle ground for straps just evaporated for me.
