I have not read Spinoza's 'Political Treatise'. But after reading Spinoza's 'Ethics' I would say his ideas can definitely be found to be disrupting to most societies around the world so I think this could be a reasons why he is not thought in Holland; but it might simply be because people who decide reading material sincerely think he is wrong :) In 'Ethics' I think Spinoza put forward one of history's strongest case for why determinism/non-free-will is not a bad thing and he honesty and successfully explored how we can learn to live with the consequences of it. It goes something like this: 'People can't help what is inside their minds; they will make decisions based on the options they can see; if you are not happy with their decisions you can't blame them since they couldn't possible be different than they are. If you know this it would even be immoral to blame them for their actions. The moral thing to do is to help them change what is inside their mind i.e educate them (suspicious people would change this word for brainwash them).' His ethics is all about not blaming people for their actions and instead try to understand and educate them. Not so different from what most people believe today. I think the problem is that these ideas sound too similar to those of Machiavelli and Nietzsche. This could be one reason why people are not comfortable with spreading Spinoza's works. I think Machiavelli's 'The Prince' and many of Nietzsche's works very much continue Spinoza's line of reasoning and explore the consequences of a society where people need to be 'influenced'/'lead' in the 'right' direction rather than 'take responsibility for their own actions'. Since the consequences of these ideas seem to turn ethics upside down and inside out for many people it is not shocking that a conservative organization such as the public education system would not fight to 'influence' people's minds with Spinoza's ideas. They don't necessarily disagree with the premiss that we should educate people rather than blame them, but since they at the same time want to agree with the premiss that 'people should be held responsible for their actions' they might find it easier to 'teach' people the first premiss with the help of some other resource; one which does not so completely smash the second premiss to pieces. 

I think we have good reason for believing that there can be 'an infinite chain of cause and effects' because we have a lot of evidence of effects which have causes, and close to no evidence of effects without causes. Except for maybe some quantum mechanic observations which we have not yet found the cause of, but since effects happen according to some probability pattern it sounds reasonable to say that one day we will find what creates the pattern, i.e. the causes, and it sounds very likely that this is just at the edge of what we know at the moment. This does not guarantee that there is 'an infinite chain of cause and effects' but it surely give us more reasons for believing that there CAN be 'an infinite chain of cause and effects', than for believing that there CANNOT be. The quantum mechanic evidence are the only evidence I know which could give us some small reasons to believe that there might not be 'an infinite chain of cause and effects', but I cannot find any reasons for believing there CAN'T possibly be 'an infinite chain of cause and effects'. I especially don't understand why difficulty in defining/describing what infinity is would give us reason to believe that it cannot exist. To me that sounds similar to saying that art does not exist because it is difficult to define accurately. 

I have heard two explanations for why present philosophers don't appear to be as important as those of the past: 

Does a scientific question which we have not yet had the resources or time to answer scientifically classify as philosophically relevant? Or does everything which can be figured out through observation disqualify as philosophy on principle? I'm constantly told that if something one day can be answered by a scientific study or if some kind of physical explanation can be given it disqualify from being philosophy. Is this how most philosophers view their field? Are you not doing philosophy when you try to come up with reasonable answers to issues in circumstances where you are not able to live up to scientific standards, for whatever reasons, or are you doing something else? And if so, what would this be? (fiction?) Wasn't all science philosophy at one point (before we had accumulated a big enough body of facts to classify it as science)? 

Science can teach you how to do something. Philosophy can teach you what to do and help you find good reasons why to bother. The most valuable perspective I ever heard on Philosophy is that it is the love of wisdom. Wisdom being defined as 'the coordination of desires in the light of all experience'. Science is a good source of experience since it is repeated and well tested experience, but as long as you are alive you have to decide what and whose desires you try to fulfill day to day, to what degree and your reasons for doing so, this is the practical use of philosophy. 

The words 'desire' and 'motivation' often appear in different kind of sentences for (what I assume is) grammatical reasons, but I have a really hard time separating them as concepts. When we talk about desire or motivation it seems like we ultimately are talking about why we act; we are seeking some kind of explanation of our actions and without desire or motivation there will be no action. We act because we desire/are motivated by X.... What motivated you / what desires caused you to do that? Do you desire x / are you motivated by x? It can be a physical (causal) explanation, e.g. the increase in dopamine drove me, it can be a design explanation, e.g. humans are 'designed to' pursue sugar, fat, sex etc, or it can be an intentional explanation, e.g. I work hard because I want money. It might feel like an explanation is sometimes about desire and some times about motivation but are we really talking about any conceptual difference? Please help me sort this out. A side point (about MY definition of a value) I understand that we can value something without being motivated by it. But a value to me is just a type of belief i.e. a belief about what we desire or should desire. Hopefully our values correspond to our desires; our values can influence our desires over time, but believing we value something does not automatically make us act accordingly; we have to make it emotional if we want something to drive us to action i.e. if we want something to motivate us / be a desire. 

I want to put forward a case for that definitions are propositions. One of my favorite ideas of all time is Quine's idea that there is no fundamental difference between a fact and a definition. "Like other Analytic philosophers before him, Quine accepted the definition of "analytic" as "true in virtue of meaning alone". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was circular. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. " ($URL$ The way I understand the theory, or my spin on it, is that ultimately all definitions have to be verified and falsified in the physical world just like facts do, since they are ultimately about the same thing; they are about our experiences of reality. When you define words with other words you are at the same time making claims about what is true (i.e. propositions). (side note: a made up a story can have definitions which are not about reality, but they are still about our experiences of reality since they are about a story which exist in a book, online or memory etc.) When you claim that e=mc2 you are both saying that mc2 is a useful definition of energy and that it is true that the function of energy can be determined by these measurements. A more straight forward example; when you say that the earth is round you are at the same time saying that round is a good definition of the shape of the earth and that it is true that the earth is round (it is actually no way near round since we have high mountains and deep valleys). When you attack the argument it can be about definition or fact, but if you change one you will have to change the other in order to stay coherent. If you say that 'almost round' is a better definition of the shape of the earth, then it is also true to you that the earth is 'almost round' and not round anymore. If you conclude that it is true that the earth is round then you are also saying that the shape of the earth is a useful definition of round. An interesting consequence of this is that 1+1 is not necessarily 2. In order to claim that 1+1 is a useful definition of 2 you have to prove it in the physical world. We have a lot of proof since we have added up a lot of apples and bananas throughout history, but there are cases when it is not true. If you add 1 pile of sand to 1 pile of sand you don't get 2 piles of sand, you only get 1. So 1x+1x is not always 2x and so it is not always true that 1+1 is 2 and 1+1 is not always a useful definition of 2 in the same way that the shape of the earth is not always a useful definition of round (even though sometimes it is). Summary: all definition are propositions because unless you can verify or falsify something which they are supposed to directly or indirectly be about they are not useful definitions because they ONLY try to describe something which does not exist i.e. something which does not have the slightest present or historical reference to reality. What use would 1+1=2 be if it had never been used to verify or falsify any real world events?
