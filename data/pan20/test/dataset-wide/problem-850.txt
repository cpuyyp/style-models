The Earth's heliocentric ecliptic longitude is opposite to the Sun's geocentric ecliptic longitude. If the Earth's perihelion is at 103 degrees heliocentric longitude, then the geocentric longitude of the Sun at that time is 283 degrees, or 13 degrees past the December solstice. 

Relative to the time-dependent equinox of date, the longitudes of a planet's ascending node and perihelion increase by 1.4 degrees per century due to precession, plus or minus smaller amounts due to perturbation by other planets. Relative to the fixed equinox of a standard epoch, those longitudes only change due to perturbation. Another explanation of this distinction is in the Wikipedia article on ecliptic coordinates. In your application, the longitude scale refers to the equinox of date for the time sliders. The vernal equinox of standard epoch J2000.0 is in astronomical Pisces regardless of time. The aphelion of Pluto's orbit should also stay in the same constellation over time, unaffected by precession of the Earth's axis. 

Ptolemy defined the tropical zodiac in reference to the equinoxes and solstices; for example, the boundary between the signs of Gemini and Cancer lies at the June solstice, wherever that may be among the stars. Consequently, precession makes the signs drift westward about 1.4$^\circ$ per century relative to the constellations. In the present day, the zodiac is roughly one sign ahead of its constellations: 

The shadow of a vertical stick would show the Sun's azimuth, but that's not really a sundial. A proper sundial's gnomon is aligned with the celestial poles so that the shadow indicates the Sun's hour angle. Then the great circle of hour angle $\pm$90$^\circ$ is projected onto the sundial plane as an east-west line; the shadow falls on that line at 6am or 6pm local apparent solar time regardless of the Sun's declination. Unless the sundial is an equatorial type, the other hour marks are spaced closer together around noon and farther apart around 6am and 6pm. 

If you extrapolate, you'll find that those ~4 minutes per day add up to 24 hours per year. The difference is due to the Earth revolving around the Sun at a rate of almost 1 degree per day. For every 365$\frac{1}{4}$ solar days, there are 366$\frac{1}{4}$ sidereal days. Civil time is based on mean solar time, in which the Sun crosses the celestial meridian every 24h 0m on average. In sidereal time, 24h 0m is the time between successive meridian transits by any given star, equivalent to 23h 56m 4s of solar time. Sidereal time also corresponds to the right ascension of stars crossing the meridian at that time. If a star in Orion has right ascension 5h 30m, then Orion is on the meridian at 05:30 sidereal time, which occurs 2 hours earlier in the solar day per month. 

Since this appears to be a screenshot of Eyes on Exoplanets, I searched for "exoplanet 485" and found Kepler-485 b. With the colors exaggerated, the label area could be "Kepler-485" in yellow overwritten with "Sun" in orange. If this is correct, it's not a cluster, just a star with a planet, plus some artifacts from the instrument which took the image. 

A university library in 1947 might have a copy of T. von Oppolzer, Canon der Finsternisse (1887), which lists those lunar eclipses on pages 368 and 374. A reader with a working knowledge of astronomy could make sense of the tables even if not proficient in mathematics or German. If that reference were not available, a text such as R. Buchanan, The Mathematical Theory of Eclipses (1904), would equip the professor to work it out from scratch. As lunar eclipses are visible from the entire night hemisphere, they are simpler to compute than solar eclipses, which are total only along a narrow path. Eclipses recur in saros cycles of 18 years and 11.3 days. Given dates of some contemporary eclipses, one could trace saros 119 back: 1945-06-25, 1927-06-15, ..., 1638-12-21; or trace saros 125 forward: 1938-11-07, 1956-11-18, ..., 2010-12-21. The saros numbers were not assigned until 1955, but the cycles were known to ancient astronomers. 

Source: F. Verleben Between the eclipse pairs in question, 2422 days = 82 lunations = 10S - 6I or 2 heptons. The two pairs also happen to be 3 heptons apart. The same hepton family includes southern hemisphere eclipses in Dec 2020, Nov 2030, and Jul 2037. Tabulated in a saros-inex panorama, all seven eclipses would fit on a single diagonal line of slope 5/3. 

Stellarium images around the March equinox and the June solstice, showing 30 degrees of ecliptic longitude and 2 hours of right ascension for comparison. Equatorial grid is blue, ecliptic grid is orange, ecliptic is yellow. The equation of time is the cumulative sum of differences between mean and apparent solar day length. Like a mathematical function and its derivative, zero crossings of one should roughly correspond to maxima or minima of the other. Differences of a few seconds per day, several weeks in a row, add up to a few minutes. The earliest/latest sunrise and latest/earliest sunset of the year do occur several days on either side of the summer/winter solstice. However, on any given day, sunrise, noon, and sunset are all behind or ahead of mean solar time by approximately the same amount. Note: the Earth's orbit is not quite circular. Following Kepler's second law, the Sun's ecliptic longitude changes ~3% slower at aphelion and faster at perihelion, making the apparent solar day slightly shorter or longer respectively. This Wikipedia entry discusses it in more detail. 

The other quirks are the $\cos(\phi)$ and $\cos(180 - \theta)$ on the left hand sides of those equations. $\arccos$ has a restricted range of $[0, \pi]$, which is OK for zenith angle but leads to 180-degree errors in azimuth unless you code east/west cases or derive new formulas where you can use . The solar hour angle should equal 0 at noon and increase by 1 degree every 4 minutes. Sunset hour angle should be about 90 degrees near an equinox, smaller in winter, larger in summer. The sunrise/sunset formulas produce times in minutes past midnight UTC, so you'll need to apply a time zone offset to get local times. 

If you want a sip from the fire hose, try reading a few preprints via arXiver. Some of those papers get published and some don't; some will interest you personally and some won't. If something goes over your head at first, look it up, and if it still doesn't make sense, ask about it here. 

Mainzer et al. 2014 characterize the performance of the reactivated NEOWISE. Having run out of cryogenic coolant for the original WISE's 12 and 22 μm bands, it only detects in the 3.4 and 4.6 μm bands. The comet looks red in the false-color infrared image because, relative to the 4.6 μm "W2" band, it emits less in the 3.4 μm "W1" band than stars do. Figure 3 of the paper shows a similar image in which an asteroid also looks red. Section 4.1 discusses comets, attributing the 4.6 μm band detection to a combination of reflected sunlight and thermal radiation from dust, 4.26 μm emission from CO2, and a little 4.67 μm emission from CO. They estimate how much is due to gas vs. dust by comparison with ground-based observations near the same times, as in Figure 17. 

If you were using both a camera lens and an eyepiece (afocal method), try eyepiece projection. In this method, the eyepiece is the only optical element between the prime focus and the detector. You would need an eyepiece projection adapter tube to connect the camera body to the telescope's focuser. A longer tube will increase magnification but also increase exposure time. Any tube length which reasonably balances those concerns should be OK. It's also possible to use a Barlow lens and no eyepiece to extend the effective focal length of the telescope. If your adapter tube is wide enough to accommodate the Barlow, you may be able to use it this way too. Astronomy Source has an article with more details about eyepiece projection. Tele Vue has an overview of that and other methods, plugging their own products of course. 

The ISS Transit Finder offers such predictions up to 30 days ahead. If a query yields no transits at the specified location, the "Show on Map" button for a close pass shows where a transit would be visible. As the documentation notes, predictions beyond 10 days are rather uncertain. Recent versions of Stellarium can show ISS's apparent position at a given place and time, offering an alternative prediction for any given event. 

2017 VR12 is expected to reach magnitude 11.8 on the night of March 6-7. This is near the limit of a 4-inch scope; actual visibility depends on your observing site, your eyes, and the magnification. You can get a more definite answer by trying to see stars of similar magnitude. The other hard part is to acquire the target. It will look like a star, so you need a finder chart showing stars at least as faint as the asteroid. If you haven't observed one before, try finding a named asteroid around magnitude 10 first. In this close approach, 2017 VR12 will move 0.9 degree per hour north-south, fast enough that you need either quarter-hour marks plotted on the finder chart or a continuously updated display. Stellarium works pretty well for me; I downloaded some of the extra star catalogs, and I import the latest available orbital elements for the asteroid of interest. If you wish to use your scope's go-to capability, this guide may help, but you still have to figure out which "star" in the eyepiece field is the asteroid. This article identifies a few brighter stars you can try to watch it pass. I do recommend getting a ~10mm eyepiece in addition to the 25mm one you have. It might help you see stars half a magnitude fainter, but the main benefit is higher magnification for planets. 

If you're running your own N-body dynamics, you can get initial Cartesian positions and velocities for each body in your system (including the Sun) by asking JPL HORIZONS for Ephemeris Type: Vectors. I would choose Coordinate Origin: Solar System Barycenter so that the Sun does not drift away from the origin, and Target Body: [Planet] Barycenter (or Sol) unless you are modeling the Earth and Moon as separate bodies. If you still want to compute initial Cartesian positions and velocities from Keplerian elements, first do a sanity check: Earth should cross the X axis at the equinoxes and the Y axis at the solstices. Second, those approximate elements for the major planets may not be precise enough for your purpose. Instead you might ask HORIZONS for Ephemeris Type: Elements, and Time Span beginning with the epoch of your elements for Apophis. You could also get elements for Apophis in a more convenient epoch this way. Note that Keplerian elements are subject to dynamic evolution and are only valid for a limited time near their epoch. If you ask HORIZONS for Apophis's orbital elements one week before and after its close approach to Earth, you can see that they are quite different. Of course the latter are also highly uncertain. For the gory post-Newtonian details of the dynamical model the Apophis prediction article discussed extending, see JPL's notes on DE430 and DE431, part III. 

Equirectangular or equidistant cylindrical projection is the simplest way to meet these requirements. Plate Carrée is the case where distortion is minimal at the equator. Dominic Ford's Map of the Constellations uses it, as do the Deep Star Maps by Ernie Wright of the NASA Scientific Visualization Studio. In free software, Stellarium calls it "Cylinder," and Cartes du Ciel calls it "Cartesian." If you plot your own, you could scale the horizontal dimension by $\cos 30^\circ \approx 0.866$ to minimize distortion at $\pm30^\circ$ declination. Since you are not plotting the polar regions, other cylindrical projections are possible. The Mercator projection is available in both Stellarium and Cartes du Ciel. Stellarium also offers the Miller cylindrical projection. 

2016 HO3 does not really orbit Earth. It orbits the Sun in such a way that it happens to loop around Earth at distances of 0.1 to 0.25 AU. Earth's gravitational sphere of influence is much smaller, about 0.01 AU at most; outside that radius, the Sun is the dominant attractor. The Minor Planet Center has an orbital diagram which you can examine in 3D. Earth's orbit is light blue. 2016 HO3's orbit is orange to the north of Earth's orbital plane and medium blue to the south. A dark gray line passes through the Sun and the asteroid's perihelion and aphelion. It's a moderately eccentric, moderately inclined orbit around the Sun with a 1.00 year period. In the course of its solar orbit, the asteroid alternately moves slower, outside, and to the north of Earth's orbit; and faster, inside, and to the south. In a rotating frame of reference fixed on Earth, as in the video you've seen, this looks like an oddly shaped, highly inclined, retrograde loop around Earth, but it is not due to Earth's gravity. Earth's slight influence helps to maintain this coincidental pattern but is not nearly enough to capture the asteroid. 

In principle a fiberscope eyepiece could work but not very well. By putting one end of the cable flush with the field stop of an eyepiece (few allow this) and the other end exactly in the telescope's focal plane, you'd get a fiber-pixelated image. A binoviewer would require two cables, difficult to align. 

Escape velocity is how fast you must go in order to keep moving away indefinitely without additional thrust. If the Earth were the only major body in the system, and you moved away from it at 100 km/h for 1180 years, you'd be 6.9 AU away. Since Earth escape velocity at that distance is only 100 km/h, you could then stop the engine and coast to infinity. If we add the Sun to this oversimplified system, you could escape it by maintaining 100 km/h until you were 36 light-years away, which would take 390 million years. In the real universe, of course, the Earth's and Sun's neighbors make their spheres of influence much smaller. 

The early 1990s Hipparcos mission yielded parallaxes for 118000 stars (Hipparcos catalog) and positions without parallax for another 2.4 million (Tycho-2 catalog). The Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution (TGAS) combines those data with preliminary Gaia observations to get 2 million parallaxes, "only" 17 times as many as Hipparcos, with better precision. If this is a small fraction of the total number of star positions, it's not a deficiency; it's just easier to get a position than a parallax. Lindegren et al. 2016 explain what they could or could not do with the first 14 months of Gaia observations. Future Gaia data releases should have still more parallaxes. 

The March equinox would be a good time to see both; the September equinox would not. Crux lies roughly between RA 12h to 13h, Dec -55$^\circ$ to -65$^\circ$. For best results, be at latitude 10-15$^\circ$ N so that both Crux and Polaris are well above the horizon, and look between 11:00 and 14:00 local sidereal time so that Crux is near the meridian. That would be around midnight in March-April, late evening in May, wee hours in February, or daytime in July-December. 

In the above plot by Hathaway, the jagged line peaking at 284.5 in June 1989 is the monthly international sunspot number. The smooth curve starting and ending a few years later is a prediction based on recent observations and statistics of past cycles. The peak of 212.5 in November 1989 is for a 13-month smoothing of the monthly number. The Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) project at the Royal Observatory of Belgium archives these data and provides this plot of the monthly and smoothed sunspot numbers together. 

The stereographic projection (Wikipedia, Wolfram MathWorld) is commonly used for all-sky maps (e.g. Skymaps.com, Your Sky). As distance from the center of the map increases, constellations grow larger but keep their shapes. 

The JPL CNEOS asteroid size estimator and various asteroid albedo papers cite Harris and Harris 1997. That paper is behind a paywall, but Stuart and Binzel 2004 attribute this formula to it: $$ H = C - 5 \log_{10} D - 2.5 \log_{10} p_V$$ where $H$ is absolute magnitude, $p_V$ is albedo, and $C$ = 15.618.

Bottom row: residual differences between top and middle. Left and right columns: dishes A and B, which point in different directions. Without further processing, the image of a point source resembles the beam profile. To reconstruct a clear image, astronomers can deconvolve the observed data with the beam profile. Lest this operation amplify noise from the observed beam map, they use a smooth mathematical model of it instead. The WMAP team developed their beam model using physical optics software called DADRA (Diffraction Analysis of a Dual Reflector Antenna). The far sidelobes were especially important for WMAP. The sky has several radio sources, e.g. our galactic center, much stronger than the desired background signal. To minimize foreground contamination, the WMAP team made an all-sky sidelobe map based on multiple observations of the Moon. Then they made a mask of the strong sources, convolved it with the sidelobe map, and subtracted the result from the observed signal. For details of how and why they did all that, see the "Ancillary Data" chapter of the WMAP 9-year Explanatory Supplement and the other publications cited there.
