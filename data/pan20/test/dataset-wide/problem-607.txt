I'd recommend a Cyclocross bike (also called CX). That's a robust road bike frame, configured to accept tyres up to about 40mm wide. You won't need 40mm unless you're doing proper off-roading, but a nice 30-35mm file tread such as a Specialized Trigger or Schwalbe Sammy Slick will run nicely on smooth pavement, will handle cobbles and bad pavement, and will also handle mild gravel/dirt. I have a setup like that, and the thing that I love about it is that I can ride pretty much anywhere from road to gravel to bike paths to rail trails to single track (except for MTB trails with lots of rocks!). Have fun. 

and they manufacturer says yes, they will re-imburse your local bike shop for the repair then you have a winner. In some cases the manufacturer says no, they didn't cause that defect. In that case the bike shop could build goodwill with you by repairing it at their cost to keep you as a happy customer. Talk to your bike shop. DONT touch the area with tools at all (let the bike shop to that as part of fault assessment...) Work with your bike shop to come to a resolve that makes everyone happy. If that fails, and the bike shop says sorry, you are out of luck in obtaining a free repair there are always other options. If you are a do it yourself person, you could remove the right side crank, remove the small sprocket, and bend it flat again (if its steel). If its aluminum, toss it and get a new sprocket. They really don't cost very much. 

Which tyres are you using? If you are using tubeless tyres (e.g. Hutchison Fusion or Schwalbe One) then they will usually seal without sealant when you install them (but don't leave them that way...). If you are not using tubeless tyres, then they will have too many holes in the sidewalls to seal without sealant. You will need to put sealant in to seal the last few gaps on the rim and pin-prick holes in the sidewalls. The easiest way to do that is to remove the valve core (assuming you have good quality valves with removable cores?) and then use a syringe or very steady hand to pour the sealant in through the valve. Also, using non-tubeless tyres on a road bike - even if it has tubeless wheels like your Ultegra 6800 - is a bad idea. Please don't do it. There is a good chance of having a tyre burp all it's air out while you are corning, causing a rapid involuntary dismount. 

No vise. No marks on part. I would just hold hub carefully with work gloves. Heck, bring it by my house, we'll have it off in 30 seconds. 

I've had this exact problem. I spent a whole lot of time removing the inner tube, patching it, etc... All to no avail. I finally figured out that the side of a drilled spoke access hole was barely visible next to the rim tape. When I'd inflate the inner tube, it would jut into that hole (depression) and get cut on the side of the drilled hole at the aluminum rim. The fix was to get better (wider) rim tape, and carefully adjust it so there was a uniform overlap at the spoke access holes. I also figured out that is VERY difficult to patch a hole on the inner side of the tube. You have to use a patch that is at least two times its width (long axis oriented along the rim...) Good luck with it. Oh, and to help me in troubleshooting, I always label the fill port on the outside side of the tire (In my case I rotate the tire so the pressure rating is next to the fill valve. Then I use a paint pen to add a tick mark on the sidewall that exactly lines up with fill valve.) This makes the pressure numbers easy to find, AND really help me in troubleshooting a leaky inner tube. I can inflate the leaky tube in a bucket of water, find the leak, then remove it to line it up with both the rim AND the tire to search out root causes for the leak. Edit.. I'm guessing that with certain rim cross sections and geometry, and with a soft rim tape, it might be possible for no sharp edges be exposed with tire and tube is off of the rim, but under high tire pressure, the rim tape may move a bit, exposing the inner tube to the sharp side of a drilled spoke access hole, or the end of a long spoke... 

When you replace the cluster (rear cogs) you almost always need to replace the chain too because they wear together. If you put an old chain on a new cluster, you often experience that kind of because the length* of the links in the chain is slightly longer than the spaces between the teeth on a new cluster. *Note the links don't actually get longer, it's just that the rollers wear out and allow a little play and the links sit a little further apart. This is known as "stretch" though it's different to the way something like elastic stretches. 

Yes - I have done this using a SP PD-8 and a Sinewave Reactor . However, it's easier if you use the Reactor to charge a cache battery, and then charge the Garmin from that. This is because the Garmin will try to switch off whenever you stop if it's running directly off the USB out of the Reactor. 

Its not exactly clear on what materials are involved. It looks like the top piece was designed with an interference fit, and pressed into the tube. I'm guessing aluminum (or is that zinc?) top piece and steel tube? It's possible to braze dissimilar materials together, but it takes some significant prep work. ($$$) If it's Aluminum to Aluminum, it would be possible to TIG weld the two together. You could save some costs by removing ALL the paint from both parts within two inches of the joint before bring them to the welder. Obviously you'd have to remove the seat from the mount, and the tube from the bike frame first. Have you talked to folks who do welding repairs? It may cost a lot less than you think. I know of one welder who's motto is "Tricycles and kitchen chairs have always been free......" 

Try wearing cycling gloves with some gel padding (perhaps you normally do but just were not for the photo) Check that your saddle is level - I find that if the saddle tilts down towards the front, then you end up sort of sliding forward and to stop that, you put more weight on your hands. Older style brakes are not well shaped for riding "on the hoods" as you demonstrate in the photo. If you look at modern Shimano, SRAM or Campag brakes (especially the high-end ones) you'll see that they present a wide and flat surface to rest your hands on when in that position. Older style brakes have a round (cross section) and often U shaped (long section) brake hood. I have that on my commuter and I agree it means for sore hands quite quickly if the road surface is rough. Good core strength will help. Can you ride with your hands off the bars, but right next to them? I.e. Still bent forward, but without being able to rest your hands on the bars? Actually that's probably too tough a test, and most cyclists who aren't racers can't do it. But you get the idea: if you can support your weight with your core/back muscles, then you wont get such sore hands. Compare the drop from seat to bars between your flat-bar bike and the Peugeot. If the drop is greater on the Peugeot (i.e. the bars are further below the seat than they are on the other bike(s)) then it may just take some time to get used to it. 

This could have also been a loose mounting bolt causing the excessive gap. So here's the way warranty works. The bike shop looks at your bike. They make a recommendation to the manufacturer about what caused the defect. If they believe it was 

This one is way easy. Use a pneumatic impact wrench. There is very little torque transmitted. Bruuupppp and its off. I use this a lot with my single speed spin on cassette with the torque from Hades. When I did this manually, I needed a six foot breaker with wheel tied down. Impact hammer is awesome. 

If you are absolutely positive you know the direction of the threads, then an air operated impact wrench will do wonders. I'm amazed at the difference when I remove threaded rear cassettes from my single speed wheels. Removal by hand requires a long breaker bar, and a second person to hold the wheel from spinning. Impact wrench is brizzzppp and done. Its much easier to hold the tools tight to the work piece this way. With long breaker bar, that's not so easy. Again you need to know which direction is which. (thumbs up to Daniel R. Hicks) 

Probably. It depends on the exact model and specs. My GF's MTB has SRAM X0 cranks and Truvative chainrings (i.e. SRAM), with Shimano XTR derailleur and Shimano cassette (not sure of the model). All of this is 10 speed - but I believe that it might not work as well with 11 speed. 

The biggest change in geometry has been the widespread adoption of 29" and 27.5" wheels. With your height, you would get a much better ride out of a bike with 29" wheels: the bigger wheels will match your 23" frame much better. 

Either of those inner tubes are fine for that tyre. I'd recommend the smaller size since it's easier to get in the tyre without folds or twists. 

You almost made it... Obviously bottom long line should run straight to crankset. You will feel some spring tension when you route the chain. 

Heck, for piece of mind, I'd make the following deal with the shop. Offer to pay for a clean and repack, but if they find anything inside (like metal debris, etc) that came from the original manufacturing process then the bike manufacturer gets to own that. My thought is.. what if a piece of extraneous metal, left in the frame during a sloppy manufacturing experience has fallen into your bearings? (loose burr on inside of seat post that has now fallen, loose weld bead, welding rod stub, etc...) What if a ball bearing has broken in half, or a race has become bent? Heck are the correct number of ball bearings in there? Many of those things would fall under warranty. Remember how the warranty works. The bike shop does a repair, and if its a valid warranty claim, the manufacturer re-imburses the local bike shop the repair costs. If the bike shop does a repair and its not considered to be under warranty, then the bike shop has to eat that loss. So work with them.. Either you pay the local bike shop, or the manufacturer pays your local bike shop. The bike shop incurs no loss and you get piece of mind, zen and harmony (in that order.) Everybody leaves happy. As an alternative, you can certainly purchase the tools to do this job by yourself. 

Yes! Go for it. What's the worst that can happen? If you don't finish, then you know that you're pushing your limits, and you will have learned more about how to do it better next time. Just make sure you take enough food, some warm/dry clothes, and you know where the bailout options are. I reckon that if you don't know all the answers in advance, then it's a real adventure and when you complete you'll be all the more happy that you gave it a go. 

Probably you need to service that hub - or get it serviced by your LBS. That much drag means that either it's full of dirt, or the grease has completely dried up or water contaminated, or the bearings have collapsed. None of those are likely to be fatal, but you would be well advised to open that hub up and clean it out, check the bearings, and re-grease it. Or have your shop do it for you.
