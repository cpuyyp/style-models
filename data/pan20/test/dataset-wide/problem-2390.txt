This question has many facets, but I will answer in as straightforward a manner as I'm capable. You ask: Still, I want to ask here and verify that this quote is accurate, and not a misunderstanding. i.e. is a belief in rebirth and karma what distinguishes the Buddhist from the materiast[sic] view on no self? I'm not sure your paraphrase of the meaning of this quote is accurate insofar as it seems to imply that a belief in rebirth and karma is the only distinguishing factor between a materialist view and what the Buddha taught. If that paraphrase of the meaning is accurate, then the answer is a decided No! to my mind. There are many differences including the truth of rebirth between what materialists think and what the Buddha taught. Still, we should be careful to distinguish between different views that can be lumped together under the designation "materialist" yet may have subtle differences. For instance, there is the ancient Indian materialist school of Charvaka or Lokāyata which although seemingly has many similarities with modern materialists or scientific reductionists, may have material differences. Yes, the pun was intended :) Anyway, did the Buddha distinguish his views from the ancient Indian materialists? Yes! And he did so in the Pali canon as well as in Mahayana Sutras. For instance, in the Samaññaphala Sutta: The Fruits of the Contemplative Life this account is given of an encounter with the ancient Indian materialist Ajita Kesakambalin who was a contemporary of Buddha Shakyamuni: 

The context for this question is contemporary Tibetan Buddhist Monastic debate and associated definitions as practiced at Sera Je Monastic University. I'm looking for answers according to the specific definitions and system of jargon used in that context. In Tibetan Buddhist monastic debate according to The Course in Buddhist Reasoning and Debate an existent is defined as, "that which is realized by a valid cognizer." I'm asking whether under such a definition a dream object - such as a snake - is considered an existent or a non-existent such as the son of a barren woman. I believe that it must be considered an existent as it is known by a directly perceiving mental consciousness given the above context. The same can be said of a face in the mirror although in this case it is directly perceived by the eye consciousness. Is this true from viewpoint of above context? Is it true from the Prasangika viewpoint? I posit that a dream snake and a snake I perceive in waking life are both conventionally existent. Further, that neither are ultimately existent. And that neither are real except from the perspective of a worldly consciousness. That is, they are both equally unreal. Is this true from the Prasangika viewpoint? If not, please give reasons according to the context mentioned above. 

The question seems an objection to Mahayana concept of emptiness. I will try and give the answer to this objection from the Prasangika viewpoint: 

It is important to understand that the Second and Third Turning teachings predate Tibetan Buddhism. These teachings were recorded and came from India before Buddhism was ever introduced to the land of snow. However, the Second and Third Turnings were not recorded in the Pali Canon and thus properly belong to the Mahayana. Do Tibetan Buddhists think these Three Turnings are contradictory? No. There is very wide agreement that these teachings - when interpreted correctly and with a proper view of which are provisional and which are definitive - do not contradict each other. 

Can progress be made toward liberation without requisite decline of the hold these concerns have on us? Here is what Lama Zopa Rinpoche has to say: 

Understanding upon awakening that the dream was unreal the young woman was able to dispel the exhilaration as well as the devastation she felt. Likewise, upon truly realizing that all this phenomenal world is unreal - utterly not existing as it appears - we too can "wake up" and achieve our aims by cutting off the craving and attachment we acquire by believing in this completely ephemeral and hallucinatory "real" world. 

To what extent is it true that "practitioners have the choice"? On what basis should or do they choose (e.g. which practice path is suited for, or available to, what practitioners)? 

Under what conditions is it proper for Buddhists of one tradition to try and proselytize Buddhists from another tradition? Under what conditions is it improper? What harm can be done? What fruits can be gained? Can cross-tradition debate be a good thing? Is it ever a bad thing? What is the proper motivation to do so? What are improper motivations? What is skillful? What is unskillful? Is it desirable to grant a modicum of respect for all traditions? How should this respect be manifested? What are examples of disrespectful dialogue and how can/should the line be drawn? Note: I'd prefer if these questions are not used to proselytize or engage in debate about Buddhist doctrine... but rather to answer the questions above. ... and references to dharma teachings, historical events, or opinions/literature of noted teachers also welcome and encouraged! 

DharmaKirti and Dignaga are highly revered in Tibetan Buddhism and their work is used as foundational materials in Tibetan Buddhist monasteries to this day including the famous Sera Jey Monastery. However, they are also considered to have espoused or based their work on either the Yogachara tenet system, the Sautrantika tenet system or some combination thereof. In brief, Yogachara/Chittamatra is a tenet system of the Madhyamaka and the Mahayana which believes in the selflessness of persons and selflessness of phenomena, but also believes in true existence which is refuted by the Prasangika-Madhyamaka. The Sautrantikas in general did not posit the selflessness of phenomena and are a tenet system strictly associated with the Fundamental Vehicle (like modern Theravada) as opposed to the Mahayana. So if by "real relations" you mean "true existence", then I think both Dignaga and Dharmakirti posited real relations. If by "real relations" you mean "inherent existence", then I think both refuted real relations. However, perhaps it is best if you elucidate what you mean by real relations and/or universals otherwise it is very easy in my experience to misunderstand one another. In my experience, when discussing tenet systems precision of language is key and knowing the jargon is very important even if difficult. I'm still struggling with it :) 

Warning: If you take anything said above as indicating that nothing exists or that this line of thought refutes the Four Noble Truths, Karma, Rebirth, the Dharma, the Buddha, the Path and the Fruits, etc., ... nothing could be further than the truth! Consider this warning a handrail to lean on if you take the above to indicate nihilism: 

Objection! Doesn't this mean that uncompounded space contains a self? Doesn't it mean that it is inherently existent? Answer... No, because it is a mere non-affirming negation. It is the mere lack of obstruction. No matter how hard you look "inside" of uncompounded space you will find nothing. There is no inherently existent self in uncompounded space that can be found. This is what is meant by a non-affirming negation. There is nothing left whatsoever to be reified. 

An analogy given to me was to imagine a person who for most of their life is a big game hunter. Perhaps hunting deer. The person grew up hunting deer with their father and grandfather perhaps. The person was around hunters all their life and surrounded themselves with similar people. Hunting deer occupied the thoughts for a very large percentage of their life. The thought of shooting and killing deer and the actual action of doing it was a well worn habit. So much so that the person self-identified as a hunter of deer first and foremost and became very attached to this description. At the moment of death, perhaps with such a well worn habit of mind, the thought of hunting deer occupied it. The persons mind was uncontrollably habituated to the thought of killing deer and so at the moment of death they found themselves occupied with this thought. What kind of life do you think this person attained after death? Now what about a person who dedicates all their life to helping others through compassion? Who occupies their mind with boundless compassion? Who is no longer slave to destructive emotions? Who has a disciplined mind trained through years of meditation focused on helping others? I think this is the thrust of the answer... I would also add that according to my tradition (Gelug branch of Tibetan Buddhism) the mind stream never ends. That is, the Buddha does not cease to exist upon reaching enlightenment and then entering Parinirvana. 

Teachers or lamas in Tibetan Buddhism are supposed to teach students according to their capacity. Of course, unless the teacher is a highly realized being it might not be possible to correctly measure a students capacity in all cases. That said, it is my understanding that teachers should strive to do this to the best of their ability. For instance, it is considered a very grave transgression to teach emptiness to dharma students who are not ready for this teaching. Why? Because it can be harmful to themselves and others by causing the student to misunderstand emptiness and believe that it doesn't matter whether we conduct ourselves virtuously or not... etc. Now, it is also best if students take some responsibility and do some self-diagnosis to decide what they are capable of in the same way students are encouraged to really check for themselves about the qualities of the teacher. I hope this helps to prevent misunderstandings and encourage beneficial dharma practice. For more, I highly recommend reading Buddhism: One Teacher, Many Traditions. 

Now, let's say someone truly arrives at this subtle understanding... how does this help to achieve our soteriological goals? The best way I can answer that is this allegory that is given in Insight into Emptiness page 258: 

Space is an impermanent thing, but uncompounded space is a permanent thing. See here for the definition of uncompounded space and how it differs from the regular notion of space. 

As mentioned in a some comments I would highly recommend In the Buddha's Words - An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon (The Teachings of the Buddha) by Buddha Shakyamuni as compiled by Bikkhu Bodhi: 

One practice you might try in such a situation is use it as motivation to contemplate the unsatisfactoriness of samsara and resolve to develop true renunciation. No matter what we do, as long as we are samsaric beings we are contributing to the suffering of others. Our very existence acts as a cause or condition for the suffering of others. The food we eat, the water we drink, the shelter we take... the basic factors we need to live all act as a cause or condition for others suffering. This comment to your question was very poignant for me: 

It is not difficult for modern western scientific reductionists to understand the most coarse and obvious meaning of anatta: the lack of a permanent, unitary, and independent person. In this culture, we are trained to look at the world from the default viewpoint of scientific reductionism. That people can be viewed as a composite of sub-atomic particles governed by the laws of chemistry and physics. We learn in elementary and middle school about caloric intake, cellular division (mitosis and meiosis), evolution, genetics and epigenetics which all make it trivial to ascertain that the person is thoroughly non-permanent, non-unitary, and dependent. So if modern culture makes it so easy to arrive at the coarse meaning of anatta, then why aren't we all Arhats?? Because there is much more to realizing emptiness than just this very coarse and trivial understanding of anatta. For the wisdom realizing emptiness to have its soteriological effect the following must be true: 

To understand this I think takes familiarization with the Dharma and specifically the teachings on the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination. 

Je Tsongkhapa in his Ocean of Reasoning commentary on Nagarjuna's Fundamental Treatise gives extensive explanation of the refutation. I will invite you to read it along with Nagarjuna's Treatise and here only repeat Nagarjuna: 

Tibetan Buddhists often talk about the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma... What are the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma according to Tibetan Buddhism? Where did they take place according to Tibetan Buddhists? How do Tibetan Buddhists interpret these Three Turnings? Is there disagreement within Tibetan Buddhists schools about which teachings are definitive and which are provisional? Do Tibetan Buddhists think these Three Turnings are contradictory? 

Nothing whatsoever is intrinsically real. Metta is not intrinsically real. The Tathagata is not intrinsically real. Nirvana is not intrinsically real. Emptiness is not intrinsically real. To be very clear, I'm not saying "nothing" taken as subject is intrinsically real either. If you could point to even one intrinsically real thing, then all this ^^^^^ would be refuted. The word "intrinsically" in the phrase "intrinsically real" signifies that it is being used synonymously or mutually inclusively with inherent existence. This is not always the case. Sometimes the word "real" is not used synonymously with inherent existence, but rather it is used to signify things that appear in concordance with how they actually exist. Under this definition, there is only one real thing: emptiness or the lack of inherent existence. That is to say, the only real thing - in that it appears the way it actually exists - is emptiness. All other things are false in the sense that they appear discordant with how they actually exist. They appear to us as having inherent existence, but they actually do not have inherent existence even in the slightest; thus they are unreal or false. To ordinary beings who don't understand the unreality of things, phenomena like a face in a mirror [or a mirage of water, dreams, a snake imputed on a rope etc.,] are considered unreal in contradistinction to so-called real things. It is easy for ordinary beings to see that a face in the mirror is unreal ie., that it does not exist in concordance with how it appears. However, it is very hard for us to see that other phenomena that we regard as "real" ... are actually completely unreal. The Prasangika Madhyamaka tenet system as elucidated by Je Tsongkhapa is considered by some the definitive and most subtle understanding of the doctrine emptiness. Under this system: 

Our death is coming Rinpoche goes on to give several examples of people recently passing away that were well known to the audience. In general, Rinpoche is giving an outline about how Buddhist practioners of the Mayahana train to think about death and the surety and finality of it. It is said that the only thing that can help us at that moment of death is Dharma. Dharma is the ultimate refuge for Buddhists at the moment of death. It is the only thing which will subdue the terror and fright that can come to ordinary beings at the moment of their own death. He continues... 

So how do the Four Noble Truths actually exist for instance? They exist utterly empty of inherent existence. They exist in dependence on conditions. It is easy to see how the First Noble Truth is dependent. The Buddha has taught that suffering is not permanent. If suffering is not dependently arisen, then it could not be impermanent. What about "The Four Noble Truths" as an abstract concept? I hope it goes without saying that abstract concepts are not intrinsically real. One might say they exist, but of course they are dependent upon conditions including the mind that conceives them or communicates them. Generally speaking, there are different forms of dependence. Dependence on causes and conditions, dependence on parts, dependence on name and form, dependence on a basis of designation and labels, etc. All existing and non-existing things (like the son of a barren woman) are included in the selfless. Even permanent things like uncompounded space are included in the selfless. Objection! If they do not exist inherently, then they must not exist at all like the son of a barren woman! Nagarjuna gives voice to this objection and then refutes it in the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way:
