In summary Both forms of exercise are for burning fat and getting fit. On average, a high-intensity workout will give better results for the time spent because you will burn more calories. A low-intensity workout may burn more fat as calories, but because your body turns fat into carbs when it needs fuel you're still going to burn through the fat. * While I can't attest for this particular book from these authors being a reliable source of information, my experience with the For Dummies books is that the authors all have excellent knowledge and experience in the domain they are writing about. 

Have you tried anything yet? Is something not working? For the purposes of my answer, I will assume you are inactive. TL;DR 

Both forms of exercise burn fat, and the average person would benefit more from a high-intensity workout, but if you're prevented from doing so don't feel a low-intensity workout can't give you results. Cross-Training For Dummies* has this to say: 

Low-intensity workout: If time isn't a factor; you aren't fit yet; or you don't wish to push yourself: a low-intensity workout would be better. Pros 

Exercise Losing fat from certain areas isn't possible (in fact: it's disproven). If you are interested in fixing those areas, the way to do it would be to tone them up with muscle instead! It's likely the abdominal exercises and leg exercises would be the way to achieve this, and you can try squats and lunges as a way of engaging your legs and abs. Both are able to be performed without any equipment (you can just use your body weight) and both should leave you exhausted afterwards! As an example program, you could do what was taught to me as 24-7: 24 squats, 24 lunges (12 each leg) and then a 100m sprint. Repeat for 7 times total. Try that 3 times a week (should take approx 20-30 minutes but don't fret if it takes you longer). However, since those exercises won't help you lose fat in those areas any more than say bench pressing, you can simply do any exercise (walking, running, swimming, bench pressing etc). I recommend those exercises as a way of toning the muscle in those areas as well as losing fat (from your entire body). Don't be afraid of the term muscle either: you don't have to worry about having enormous, muscly legs after a dozen squats. Body-builders spend years getting their bodies to look the way they are. Measurable goals My final thing to mention is to have a measurable goal. Wanting to "lose fat from my thighs and tummy" is great for motivating yourself to do something, but you need to have a measurable goal and I recommend measuring yourself! Although you mention losing 10kg, depending on what you weigh that might be more difficult than you think. Start by taking measurements now and then repeat every 2-4 weeks (note: do not do it too frequently. Losing weight won't happen overnight!). Make sure you measure yourself consistently! To measure your legs: take a tape measure mark the middle part of your leg from your hip to your knee. Then wrap the tape measure around and record the number. To measure your tummy: wrap the tape measure around the largest part of your waist (where your belly button is) I don't advise weighing yourself, since muscle weighs more than fat and if you start to build muscle (again: don't be scared of building muscle. Think of it more as sculpting your body) you won't necessarily lose weight. Taking measurements is far better for what you want, since even if you tone up with muscle your measurements will go down from the fat loss. Alternatively, you can obtain a body composition test which will measure your fat and muscle percent. Diet Note that when I use the word diet I am talking about the food you habitually eat. This only requires a brief mention, because as long as you aren't putting on weight the food you are eating is probably fine. Your body will convert your fat and carbs into energy for you when you start needing it (e.g. exercise), so it's more about using that energy than altering what you are eating. So: if your diet (the food you habitually eat) isn't causing you to gain weight, there's no need to alter it. 

I can't do the latter because I work out in my room and well there is no room for sprints. I like mountain climbers but it doesn't exhaust me as much as Burpees do so I rather just stick to that as it is the most exhausting. So I just want to do Burpees. How many do I have to do and how many reps of each and how much rest in between reps in order to burn an insane amount of calories (and then fat) per day? Details: 

I hate exercise, I find it excruciatingly boring. But I am overweight and need to lose fat fast. The main reason why I find it boring is because it takes too long and I don't like doing a a variety of exercises. It seems like you have to run on a treadmill for half an hour to lose the calories you get from eating one apple. And following exercise dvds with it's myriad of exercises is just painfully annoying. I want to get my daily exercise session over with as fast as possible while getting the most out of it. So I am looking to do some intense high straining cardio exercises to the point where my heart is beating really fast and I am burning a lot of calories and fat. The exercises I found so far that does this for me are: 

Today I can barely walk, my leg muscles are aching a lot. After being seated for a while if I get up to walk it is very hard. But I noticed after a while once I'm warmed up a bit I can pull it off. So I think I will be able to do the same workout I did yesterday today. The question is should I? I reckon my leg muscles are hurting because I tore them up with my exercise and now in order to allow them to regrow and grow bigger I should rest. But my goal at the moment is to lose weight, not so much to grow muscle. Hence all my exercises are cardio. For someone in my situation who is looking to lose weight and lose it fast, should I be doing this sort of cardio daily? or take breaks? If I should take entire days off how many a week?
