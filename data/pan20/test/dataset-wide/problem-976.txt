As Pont says, there's little evidence that the magnetic field has no observable evidence on the long term climate of earth, there was a recent study which drew a link between the solar wind strength and the frequency of lightning storms. Given that the amount of incoming charged particles from the solar wind that make it into the atmosphere is dependent on the strength of the magnetic field. This is however short term weather not climate, however it does show that the strength of the magnetic field does have an effect on the atmospheric systems, albeit not in the long run.

Essentially, life on Earth before about 540 million years ago (The so called Cambrian 'Explosion') was a little boring, as in it was primary simple multi-cellular organisms that didn't have many hard parts (the bits that get recorded in the fossil record). Think like a sponge today. These kind of life forms have a pretty poor preservation potential as its called, so before about 550 million years ago the fossil record (in terms of actual fossils) is absolutely terrible. However we do have existence of life before this time, despite this. For example the Stromatolites which go back 3.5GA. And while fossils as we think of them today are rare in this period, we have other evidence of life. For example, life has a habit of 'preferentially' uptaking certain isotopes of carbon, meaning that life leaves a so called isotopic signature in the geological record. These 'signatures' are not direct evidence and are known as 'proxies'. So essentially we have no evidence of a civilization other than ours existing anywhere in Earth's history, and in fact life itself is pretty boring before about 540 million years ago. 

I would recommend to do an undergraduate in physics. I work at a department of Meteorology. When faculty hire a new PhD student or postdoc, they often prefer those with an undergraduate in Physics than with an undergraduate in Meteorology. The Physics degree gives a better preparation for doing science. It has more maths and physicists are more likely to have some programming experience than meteorologists. For most scientific positions, such programming experience is highly valuable. It appears the meteorologists are more likely to end up in jobs like weather forecasting or energy trading, rather than science. Although this experience may be quite localised, a physics undergraduate degree does give you a more generic background. It's easier to catch up on the specifics of geophysics when you have a physics background, than the other way around. 

Provide a monthly average in every grid cell, and describe how many measurements were used for each cell. There is no fixed rule for the minimum number of days for reporting a monthly average. A reasonable threshold will depend on the geophysical quantity of interest y, in particular on how much y varies on short and long timescales. If y varies from month to month, but does not vary a lot from day to day (example: sea surface temperature), you can probably get away with reporting a monthly average even when only one or two days have cloud-free measurements. On the other hand, if you're measuring precipitation, your signal will be relatively noisy even if you choose a threshold of 20 days. And any threshold is going to introduce a bias, because a lack of observation is typically due to clouds. Although you will get a bias in any case. In other words, if you only have one day per month you see a gap and in the clouds to observe whatever you want to know, it is a pity to throw it away. Therefore, personally I choose a minimum of 1 observation. Critically important though: when releasing the product, add a field that tells the user how many days worth of measurements make up the monthly average in any given cell! Like that, the user can decide which ones to use and which ones not to use. More broadly speaking: producers should document everything they do. For your specific examples: search for the ATBD and/or scientific papers describing the product. Hopefully, there is a field in the level-3 product that describes the number of measurements per cell. If the answer is not in there, write to the producers and tell them to redo the product... You will need this information to accurately calculate a yearly average! 

Do they move at the group velocity of Rossby Waves? Or do they move at the phase velocity of Rossby Waves? Or some other speed? 

They can be seen in the diagram below (of the CERES radiation dataset - supposedly they contribute a lot to the total variance in net radiation, which is the sum of SW and LW) - just west of Peru and Mexico (my supervisor, Dargan Frierson, said these are stratocumulus regions). I'm just wondering - why are stratocumulus clouds so abundant there? (the diagram is taken after taking the 12-month running mean of the dataset, which smoothes out a lot of features). 

And how does their temporal resolution compare with proxies for air temperatures? Can they forecast ocean temperatures in all regions of the ocean equally well, or only some regions of the ocean? 

Interested in this since I sometimes look down on the clouds in the plane, and wonder if some of the reflected UV-A radiation might damage my eyes. 

Or in other words, can they be seen as sources of heat transport? If so, what can be thought of as the heat source, and what can be thought of as the heat sink? 

Does that mean we can say nothing? Well, it's not quite so pessimistic. There are many attempts to answer this question. The figure below shows estimates for the regional distribution of the shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effect, again from AR5 WG1: 

Wikipedia tells me that, in electronics, a breadboard is a construction base for prototyping electronics. The details of the article do not appear relevant for the algorithm usage, but it makes me guess that the meaning of breadboard is related to prototyping. However, from context, it is clear that the job ad or the ENVISAT paper has nothing to do with electronics. What does breadboard mean in the context of Earth observation retrieval algorithm development (which are the only contexts I could find)? Is it simply a synonym for prototype, or does it have a different meaning? 

Out of the total water on Earth, only a tiny fraction is held in the atmosphere at any given time. Therefore, the direct effect of melting land or sea ice will not result in an increase in specific humidity. However, warm air can contain more water than cold air, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Therefore, the climate warming that causes the ice caps to melt, will also result in an increase in average specific humidity. This is (approximately) an exponential relation (I don't have access to my textbooks right now, but googling saturation vapour pressure water equation yields many forms; I do not include them here because none I found use SI units). 

Firstly, I'd like to state that so far there is no evidence that a civilization similar to ours has appeared on Earth before us. It might be apparent that we as a species have left quite a significant geological footprint, (if we didn't Archeologists would be out of a job!), and as of yet we've discovered no evidence to indicate a civilization that cannot be explained by either our species or our close relatives, such as Neanderthals. Also this evidence is completely contained within the last few hundred thousand years (very recent in Geological time). In addition for 'eukaryote' life forms to exist (such as humans) oxygen is required so that respiration can occur. If we look at evidence for oxygen in Earth's atmosphere for the majority of it, oxygen is purely a trace element, and simply not enough to sustain complex life forms (as we know it I might add!). This would suggest that not only is there no evidence for complex life forms to exist, there is evidence that complex life forms are simply not possible for most of Earth's history. 

Has the relative ratio of sedimentary over igneous rocks increased, simply as a result of more and more of the Earth's rock being exposed to sedimentary processes? Or has it increased only for the first billion years of Earth's history, and stayed fairly constant afterwards? 

Was there a significant bias between the ensemble of climate models and the long-term temperature trends? What about spatial patterns? 

Rivers help transport sediment from higher regions into the oceans (where it's hard to get back into the atmosphere). And this sediment could be carbon-rich. 

As an example of an atmospheric river, see $URL$ These events have been known to hit areas like California and Bergen, Norway. 

The Younger Dryas was associated with less heat transport from the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere (and a lower flux of the meridional overturning circulation). So I'm wondering - what were the temperatures of the SH like during that period? 

I'm interested in this problem because I'm interested in obtaining a rough estimate of the average temperature increase of the sea given a net radiative forcing of 0.6 W/m^2. But in order to obtain an estimate, I need to know the volume of the ocean between 0-2000m. I'm also interested in knowing the volume of the ocean between any other two arbitrary layers of the ocean (0-1000m, 1000-2000m, 0-4000m, etc..) 

To be sure about why it appears to be centered around -0.2°C, you'd have to go to the original source of the graph. However, as an educated guess, I would imagine that they are showing the anomaly compared to some recent period, such as 1961-1990 or 1971-2000, as is commonly done. From your Wikimedia Commons link, this figure appears to be original work by a Wikipedia author. The link does not appear to state this, so this is rather sloppy and perhaps illustrates why it's preferable to obtain information from peer reviewed sources. If the temperature increase stays at +0.4°C, it is not catastrophic. However, considering the greenhouse gases (GHG) we have already pumped into the atmosphere, temperature increase will not stay at +0.4°C. With currently projected increases in GHG emissions, the global average temperature increase may range from anything between +1.5°C and +6.5°C, with some regions exhibiting far larger temperature increases than that. At such scales, the entire climate system might enter a different state, which means many regions will have climates very unlike before. And then I'm not even mentioning the problems associated with sea level rise yet. 

Could it be measured by taking the Laplacian over all tiles and then averaging it, for example? (this question can be relevant for both surface topography and ocean bathymetry). I think measuring it relative to Earth's geopotential would be fine. 

Cloud forcing is still one of the major uncertainties of radiative forcing in climate modeling because there are so many uncertainties in it (and parametrizations). But also because the timescale of cloud development are much shorter than the timescale that climate models are run at. So I'm curious: are clouds much easier to simulate in the short timespans of weather models? Or are they still a beast to simulate in them? 

As seen in the figure below. The larger the temperature difference between surface and cloud, the more positive the radiative forcing is from the cloud. So as the cloud moves up, it supposedly should move into a colder altitude. But doesn't climate change also increase the temperatures at any given altitude too? If so, why does the cloud move up into a colder altitude due to climate change? (even after accounting for heating at the given altitude?) 

The Swedish meteorological agency SMHI on its website (NB: freezes Firefox on Linux for me, likely due to plugins, works in Chrome) indicates how certain the forecast for a particular day is. Looking at today (Wednesdays) forecast for the coming week for Kvikkjokk, they estimate that the forecast for Friday is ganska säker (somewhat certain), for Saturday is osäker (uncertain), and for Sunday is säker (certain); they estimate that the forecast for Sunday is more certain than the forecast for either Friday or Saturday. I suppose that what they do is look at the forecast ensemble and estimate certainty based on agreement between different runs from the ensemble. But as the state of the atmosphere on Sunday should depend on the state on Friday and Saturday, is there any way how it can make sense that the forecast for Sunday is more certain than the one for Friday or Saturday? 

The turbopause separates (by definition) the homosphere from the heterosphere. What factors cause the turbopause to be where it is? Is it affected by mesopheric composition, solar irradiance, global atmospheric change, and other factors that may change significantly? Or is it mostly determined by density in the absolute sense, and therefore relatively constant?
