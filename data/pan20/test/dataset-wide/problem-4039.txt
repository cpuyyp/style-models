Consider an elliptic PDE such as $$\mbox{tr}(A(x)D^2 u(x)) = f(x), \quad x \in B_1\subset\mathbb R^n,$$ where $A(x)$ is symmetric and $0<\lambda I \leq A(x) \leq \Lambda I$ for all $x$. Let us assume $f$ and $A$ are smooth. Many a priori estimates of the form $\|u\|_X \leq C(\lambda,\Lambda)\|f\|_Y$ or $\|u\|_X \leq C(\lambda,\Lambda)(\|f\|_Y + \|u\|_Z)$ can be derived, for some norms $X$, $Y$, $Z$. My question: is there a general method for determining the dependence of the constant $C$ on the ellipticity constants $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$, or is it necessary to dig into the proof of the particular estimate? For concreteness, we may consider an $L^2$-$L^\infty$ estimate like $$\|u\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2})} \leq C(\lambda,\Lambda)(\|f\|_{L^\infty(B_1)} + \|u\|_{L^2(B_1)}).$$ In the case where $A$ is a constant matrix, the sketch would go something like this: divide the equation by $\Lambda$ and find a matrix $M$ such that $M^2 = A/\Lambda$. Letting $v(x) = u(Mx)$, we have $$\Delta v = \mbox{tr}(M^2 D^2u) = \mbox{tr}((A/\Lambda) D^2u) = f(x) / \Lambda.$$ Applying the estimate to $v$, we obtain $\|v\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2})} \leq C(\|f/\Lambda\|_{L^\infty(B_1)}+\|v\|_{L^2(B_1)})$, with $C$ independent of $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$. Finally, we change variables back to $u$, which gives us a factor of $(\Lambda/\lambda)^{d/2}$ next to $\|u\|_{L^2(B_1)}$, since $M$ satisfies $\sqrt{\lambda/\Lambda}I \leq M \leq I$. (The norms are now over $M(B_1)$ instead of $B_1$, but we can fix this by rescaling $u$, at the cost of another power of $\sqrt{\Lambda/\lambda}$ which we can compute explicitly.) But in the variable-coefficient case, one would need a different change of variables at every point, which would lead to cross terms in the equation for $v$. Alternatively, one could fix a point $x_0$, rewrite the equation as $$\mbox{tr}(A(x_0)D^2 u) = f(x) - \mbox{tr}((A(x) - A(x_0)) D^2 u),$$ and apply the constant coefficient case, but our estimate becomes $$\|u\|_{L^\infty(B_{1/2})} \leq C(\lambda,\Lambda) (\|f\|_{L^\infty(B_1)} + \|(A(x_0) - A(x))D^2u\|_{L^\infty(B_1)} + \|u\|_{L^2(B_1)}),$$ where we now understand how $C$ depends on $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$, but we have an extra term. At this point, we can apply a Schauder estimate to replace $D^2 u$ with some Holder seminorm of $u$--assuming we know how that constant depends on $\lambda$ and $\Lambda$--but we are still left with a "worse" estimate than the one we started with. Are there more general tricks, or do we simply need to redo the original proofs and be careful about our $\lambda$s and $\Lambda$s? 

Let $f: M \to N$ be a smooth maps between smooth manifolds. Then $f$ is a submersion (by definition) if its differential is also surjective. Now suppose $f$ is surjective. Is it possible that the surjective map $f$ fails to be a submersion on a set in $N$ of measure non-zero? If so, what is such a map? Suppose the manifolds $M$ and $N$ are non-compact. Does this change the previous answer? Thanks! 

Are you sure you need the distance function $\|XX^T-YY^T\|_2$? If not, the solution to \[ \min {\|E\|: E \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}, (X+E)^T(X+E) = I } \] for the 2-norm and the Frobenius norm is the polar decomposition; see, e.g., section 4 in $URL$ . Maybe you do want $\|XX^T-YY^T\|_2$ as distance function because of the equivalence by the orthogonal group. In that case you maybe want to rephrase your problem on the Grassmann manifold on linear subspaces. In fact, the Stiefel manifold with the orthogonal group factored out is exactly the Grassmann manifold. There is a nice paper about this: $URL$ . 

Cospectral graphs are graphs having same eigenvalues. Constructions of cospectral graph is an interesting question in graph theory. Now a days we use graph theory in different brunches of Sciences and Technology. I am looking for some applications of the idea of cospectral graph. Please provide some examples with references. 

Different labeling on a graph produces class of isomorphic graphs. Two isomorphic graphs possess similar characteristic such as connectivity, degree distribution of vertices, equality of spectrum and many others. I am looking for some properties of graph which depends particularly on vertex labeling. One such property is separability of the quantum state related to that graph. Depending on the vertex labeling two isomorphic graphs may generate different quantum states with different separability. Is there any other properties of graph which depends on vertex labeling only? 

If all the discrete eigenvalues of $V$ are simple--so that, if I understand correctly, the eigenfunctions must have definite parity--does the parity of the eigenfunctions necessarily alternate? This seems to be the case in every example I've seen, but I don't know why it should be true. Can we say anything about the bottom of the continuous spectrum? E.g. if there are two discrete eigenvalues $\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 0$ corresponding to even $\phi_1$ and odd $\phi_2$, will $0$ have an even eigenfunction or an even resonance? Would any of this change if $\mathcal L$ were replaced by a general Sturm-Liouville operator on $\mathbb R$? 

Given any open set $D$ in $\mathbb R^n$, we can define the first Dirichlet eigenfunction $u$ of $-\Delta$ on $D$ as the minimizer of the Rayleigh quotient over $H_0^1(D)$. Interior regularity of $u$ follows easily, but in general it seems we cannot say anything about the regularity of $u$ up to the boundary. But conversely, if we know $u$ is say globally Lipschitz continuous on the closure of $D$ (assume $D$ is bounded), does this tell us anything about the regularity of the boundary $\partial D$? For example, that it is locally a Lipschitz graph? What if $u$ has even more regularity? This seems like a natural question, but I cannot find a reference or think of a way to construct counterexamples. 

The answer of Theo basically says it all what the exponential is concerned, but I maybe can shed some light regarding the optimization perspective. Let $M$ be your Lie group and suppose it is a subgroup of $\textrm{GL}_n$. Now, if you want to solve \[ \min f(x) \quad \textrm{s.t. $x \in M$} \] by an iterative method, one usually uses a so-called smooth retraction map \[ R_x: T_x M \to M. \] to replace your current approximation $x$ to $x_+ := R_x(\Delta)$. Think for example of doing a line-search $R_x(-t \textrm{ grad}_x f)$ for $t>0$ where $\textrm{ grad}_x f$ is the Riemannian gradient of $f$. (The retraction map has to fulfill some properties, in order for this to work, likes smoothness and being a first-order approximation of the geodesics (see below).) Due to the left (or right) action of a Lie group on itself by multiplication, the exponential mapping at the identity $\exp$ can be transported to get a retraction at $x$ as $x\exp$. As Theo already explained, $\exp$ does not need to be a global diffeomorphism, but that is not needed for optimization, since we perform updates locally. Another typical choice for $R_x$ are the geodesics in $x$. For some metrics, the $\exp$ coincides with the geodesics (for instance, bi-invariant metrics), but not always. One can also use cheaper alternatives for $R_x$ if your are only concerned with optimization. A nice reference for this retraction-based optimization on manifolds (and so, also Lie groups) is $URL$ . 

Consider a bipartite graph of order $2n$ with equal bipartitions $C_1$ and $C_2$, where, $$C_i = \{v_{i,1}, v_{i,2}, v_{i,3} \dots v_{i,n}\}; i = 1, 2.$$ Given two vertices $v_{i,p}$ and $v_{i,q}$, $Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q})$ denotes set vertices adjacent to both $v_{i,p}$ and $v_{i,q}$ with $1 \le p,q \le n$. Indexes $p$ and $q$ may or may not be equal. We denote cardinallity of $Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q})$ by $\#(Nbd(v_{i,p}, v_{i,q}))$. I want to calculate number of bipartite graphs, such that, $$\#(Nbd(v_{1,p}, v_{1,q})) = \#(Nbd(v_{2,p}, v_{2,q})) ~\forall~ p,q ~\text{with}~ 1 \le p,q \le n.$$ To construct all these graphs, I am also looking for an existing algorithm, if available. 

For a given number of nodes how many non-isomorphic graphs are available? Might be this is an open problem. For less number of vertices some computational statistics available. I want to get all non-isomorphic graphs of order $5, 6, \dots 12$. Is there any complete list of all non isomorphic graphs available for a given number of nodes? If possible please give me its links or some references. If I wish to calculate it myself, which software package may be useful? 

Hello all, I recently came across the following Theorem in Gibson (Singular points of smooth mappings, 1979). Since I haven't seen this result somewhere else and this reference is not so widespread, I was wondering if it is correct, known or trivial? Theorem B4 in Gibson79: Let $\phi: G \times M \to M$ be a smooth action of a Lie group $G$ on a smooth manifold $M$. Suppose that the action is semi-algebraic (i.e., the graph of $\phi$ is a semi-algebraic set). Then all the orbits are smooth submanifolds of $M$. (Smooth means $C^\infty$; smooth submanifold means a differential manifold that is embedded.) The proof goes as follows. The orbit at $x \in M$ is semi-algebraic by Tarski-Seidenberg. Every non-void semi-algebraic has at least a one neighbourhood where it is a submanifold in $M$. Since orbits are homogeneous by the action of $G$, this neigbourhood extends to the whole orbit. Thanks! 

Two graphs are said to be cospectral if they have same eigenvalues wrt adjacency matrix, Normalised or Signless laplacian matrix. How many graphs has cospectral mates for a given number of nodes? We know answer to this question when number of nodes is less than $12$. I did not see any research paper till now where author has shown any algorithmic approach to compute those statistics. Either it is too simple to say or they do not wish to disclose it. For a given number of nodes I like to compute number of graphs with at least one cospectral mate. Is there any algorithmic way to do so? If available please give me some references. Thank you for your help.
