Part of the problem is your perceptions. These people are not morons, they are extroverts. Chatting about social issues is part of how they get things done. It is normal and expected behavior for them. You sound like an introvert which is why you don't get what they do. So the first step is to stop thinking of them as morons because they are different from you. People can often perceive when you are putting them down even when it is only mentally becasue your actionsand body language speak louder than words. So stop doing it. Part of why they think you are an ass is because they know you think they are morons. No one likes someone who is patronizing and who clearly dislikes them. Another issue some people have is that they think everyone else is stupid if they aren't experts in their own chosen field. I assure you, some of these people you think of as morons are very good at what they do for a living and some of them are very nice, good people and very few of them are actually stupid. There are far fewer introverts than extroverts, so you need to get along in their world as they make the rules. So accept that a certain amount of social interaction will help you get along better in the workplace. Think of it as a required but boring task like doing your timesheet. So spend a few minutes each day actually socializing. You don't have to get over-friendly, but smiles and hellos and the occasional remark about the Super Bowl and asking about their family grease the wheels of commerce and help you be more respected in the company. It may not seem fair, but it is just how life is. Another thing that people need to realize if that you don't have to like a person to work with him or her effectively. What you have to do is to not ever overtly show your dislike. Next, treat that person exactly the same way you treat somone you do like. That means being cooperative when need be, it means telling them information they will need to do their jobs, it means complimenting them when they do something right. It means treating everyone you meet with respect. That means no eyerolls, no sarcastic comments, no avoiding them and making their job and your job harder as a result. Even if you are not chatty, if you treat everyone (and I do mean everyone including those below you in the organization struture) with respect and kindness, then you will get respect and kindness back. Show concern for their lives by asking about their children and sending sympathy cards and celebrating their successes. Help people out when they need it - even when not asked. Do things like help the person get the door open when she has her hands full. Helping doesn't have to take long or be a burden. Nor does it require a long chat. It costs you five minutes to send a thank you note or fill our a form for an employee reward or send someone's boss an email or helping to clean up the mess that someone made when they tripped and fell and spilled coffee everywhere. People remember kind actions and they will return them. 

I disagree entirely with the idea. When I do creative work, that's inherently messy and a requirement to keep everything spit-polished is not only ridiculous, it is counterproductive. I file visually, I can always find something in the stack on my desk but if it goes into a file folder it is lost forever. It is wasteful of time to be forever cleaning when I could be working. Not everyone works well in neat conditions. I find them distracting and uncomfortable and I can't find what I need. 

What this says to me is that the owner is likely dictating the question and he is showing his predjudices clearly. For whatever reason, he doesn't want to hire single people unless they are properly engaged as that is the only legitimate reason to be single. This indicates to me that he is a person who believes that only one lifestyle is appropriate and that anyone who differs with him is not going to do well in that company. I am single and I have seen a lot of this prejudice against people being single and around here (I live in a very conservative area), it is almost always related to the owner having religious beliefs that gays were unacceptable and anyone not married by a certain age must be gay. It screams out to me that the owner wants to dictate your private life be lived only on his terms. It is a clue that he doesn't care about discrimination, he is more than willing to intimidate his HR person into asking questions she has probably advised him he can't ask (and note he had someone else do it so he wouldn't be the responsible person) and who knows what other legal issues he will want you to break in the name of his profit. This is also the type of person who will expect you to share his political and religious views. It screams to me that this is a company to be avoided at all costs. I would have looked her straight in the eye and told her that the interview was terminated as I would not work for a company with such poor ethics. Then I would have left. 

If someone approaches you who is not your new boss, refer that person to your boss. It is that simple. If he feels that the helping is a priority, then do it cheerfully. If he feels that the work he hired you to do is a priority, then he will tell them that you can't do it. Likely it will be a mix of both depending on what is on your plate at the moment. And talk to your boss about the issue on your first day to have a game plan in place. He may ask you do go ahead and answer questions that take less than 15 minutes but if it is going to take longer, then you would need to have the task priority adjudicated by him. Do not take on such tasks without your current boss's knowledge and permission. You don't want to work overtime to do your real work because you were doing someone else's. 

Another reason not to ask your company for an advance is that companies do not like employees who are in financial trouble. They are the ones who tend to a greater risk for stealing from the company. Asking for an advance for anything less than my child just got diagnosed with cancer is a huge risk that you will be put on the list of employees to get rid of at the first opportunity. This is also a reason to get your act together as it will be much harder to get another job if you have financial problems. 

Start-ups are inherently risky. For this reason,I would not consider one unless I had at least 3 months of income saved and preferably 6 months to a year. I've known too many people through the years that were having a great time at a wonderful start-up that stopped paying their paychecks very abruptly with no clue that the company was about to be out of money. To reduce the risk (and start-ups can be a great place to expand your skills and lots of fun to work at so you may want to work there even with the risk) - I would consider some of the following: How much of their idea are they willing to tell you. From what they told you does it sound like something that would have a viable income stream? If it is a consumer type product, would someone non-technical be interested in purchasing? Is is going to depend on ad sales or customer payment. Do they have an actual business plan that they will share with you after you sign a non-disclosure agreement. Start-ups without things like formal business plans are much more risky. This tends to mean that the money source is not professional (or really non-existant, most places that lend money to start-ups insist on a business plan) which is usually a bad sign. What track record does the current top guy have? It's alot less risky to work on a start-up run by someone with a track record of running another successful business. If the start-up has no one with business-running experience at all - run like the wind. Are they hiring marketing people as well as developers? A great product that no one knows how to market will still likely fail. Are they spending their intial funding on nice-to-haves or must-haves? Those with the fancy offices with the fireplace and the entertainment room, etc. are the ones most likely to fail. Nice-to-haves come after the income starts coming in, not before. If you are not willing to move, are there other places locally that you will be able to get a job in on short notice if they fail. If the area has plenty of development jobs, you can probably afford to take the risk becasue you won't be out of work long if the company fails. Are they going to expect you to work 80-120 hours a week for almost no pay for the hope that you will strike it rich in the end with your stock options? Assume that the stock options will be worthless when deciding if the salary and work conditions are acceptable. Don't bet on an outcome that is not likely. 

I have to take the other tack here. HR Departments do not like or appreciate people who call frequently. The Federal government generally moves slowly in HR terms; it can take months to go through all the applications and determine who is considered highly qualified. Bugging the people doing this is a good way to go to the bottom of the file of applications to be reviewed. This is not showing intiative or enthusiam (the hiring offical will never know you called), this is being a pest. The person looking at the app may have thousands of applications for various postions to go through. I remember one time we we were hiring, we had 900 applications for that one position alone. The HR person is probably trying to go through the applications for multiople postions. The truth is there is nothing you can do to speed up a government hiring process unless the hiring manager knows you and wants you and even then it is really difficult. They have a much more structured process than private industry and I have seen candidates the hiring manager wanted to hire from personal knowldege get turned down because HR would not rate them as qualified. Since they told you they are reviewing your application, you know they got it. If you get told you are not qualifed for the position, then you should see if you can speak to the HR person to find out why. This is a time when you should contact them, not when waiting for a response. Often they make mistakes and a little explanation can go a long way towards correcting this. Be aware though that when they say things like needs 4 years of experience or equivalent education, they are not going to think you are qualifed on only 3 years and 9 months. They tend to be much less flexible on requirements than private industry. I assure you that any company or government agency that is interested in your application will contact you. Not hearing from them is generally a sign that you are not in consideration. However, since the government moves so slowly. not hearing from them in only two weeks means nothing. It could be months before they get back to you as there are multiple things that can affect the date including govvernment-wide hiring freezes. In general once HR gets through with the applications, they pass them on to a hiring manager who may appoint a team of people to go throuhg the applications and determine who to interview. The HR filtering is just to remove the unqualifed from thestack, so the hiring officals have fewer applications to look at. Again it may take weeks for them to set up interviews as they all have full time jobs to and making the time is often difficult. HR often will not let candidates know they are being turned down until the hiring people have determined who is going to be interviewed. This is becasue sometinmes the hiring officals don't like the chocies and go ask for the applications that were filtered out. Of course here in the US, we are heading towords a major holiday and people who might be looking at these things both in HR and the actual department may be on vacation, so that tends to slow things further. 

One thing you could do to keep the animal lovers from getting upset is to hand the problem to them to solve. Tell them the geese need to go and ask them to find a humane solution for you. 

My personal guideline is that I never say anything against a specific person, but I may bring up certain corporate policies especially concerning pay and benefits that may have recently changed for the worse. For instance, if a copmany has frozen pay raises, they should know that it is causing people to leave. If a company has required pay cuts, again, that is something that they should know had a cost. If they dropped the 401 K match (hey that is a cut to my compensation) or changed to a bad health insurance provider, then yes I will bring that up. The people who made those particular kinds of decisions are not ones who will negatively impact my career later on. People bringing up these types of things when they leave gives HR ammunition to help fight bad corporate choices. People not ever saying it affected them means that the company will be happy to do more and more draconian things until people start to tell them they are leaving for that reason (and until the retenion numbers get to a certain point). However, if your problem is your manager is a jerk or incompetent or not supportive of your needs to get the work done, don't bring that up. It could potentially affect your career. He is likely to have friends who are hiring managers other places in the same field. He might be likely to be someone you see again at a another company. 

You need to chillout. I have had it take months from the application until the interview. And months from the interview to the job offer. One day service from HR is unrealistic to expect especially at the entry level which is most likely the least important task she is doing right now. The time of year you are asking it also affects how soon they will respond. Let me explain what could be higher than you in her rankings of work to do (some of these assume a small company 1 person HR): 

First as a junior person, it is up to you to adjust to the work place culture not the culture to adjust to you. A workplace cannot adjust to the desires of every individual who is hired as they all would do things differently from each other. It is the job of the seniors to point out mistakes and pressure you to perform better. That will happen in virtually every workplace, so get used to it. Do they favor some people, chances are pretty close to 100% that they will. That too is normal and ordinary in any workplace. You need to understand what they want and give it to them in order to be one of the favored people. Clearly you do not. Until you build up some credibility through good performance and understanding the underlying politics of this workplace, you have virtually no chance of proposing change and getting it implemented. So what you need to concentrate on first is getting that credibility. Then you can work on how things can be improved in the workplace.
