Mars has a CO2 atmosphere, which is not orange but a reddish-brown similar to its surface. CO2 is fairly nonreactive, so there aren't a lot of questions about "what would X material do". The biggest difference is that things wouldn't burn, and metal wouldn't rust. But it's not exactly orange, and nonreactivity is BOOO-RING. If you want something that's really orange, I would go for bromine. It exists as a liquid under normal conditions, but easily evaporates like water, so an atmosphere of it is reasonable. It is also very nasty stuff. It is a halogen in the same family as chlorine and fluorine, which means it reacts violently with most metals. It also tends to attack organic materials by replacing the hydrogen. These properties would make for an interesting space suit design challenge. One other thing to consider is that bromine gas is not transparent, so at the bottom of an atmosphere it could get very dark. As for sunrise and set, they are ruled by Rayleigh Scattering, the same process that makes the sky blue, and that would still be true with either CO2 or bromine. I would expect even deeper reds and oranges in either case, and no blues because blue light would be absorbed. You would need large molecules similar in size to visible light (400-750 nanometers) to get a different type of scattering, while most gas molecules are a few tenths of a nanometer. 

The good news? Learning one language makes it easier to learn more. Once you know what the perfect past tense is, or imperative mood, or passive voice, or dozens of other obscure grammatical concepts we use everyday but rarely know the names for, you can apply that knowledge in other languages. So let's suppose that the implant gives you all that knowledge, then just plugs in the necessary words from the particular language's vocabulary list. Basically, it doesn't teach you a language, it teaches you language as an abstract concept. Then you download a language pack as needed. So how big would one of these language packs have to be? After just a few minutes of research, I feel pretty confident saying that question is impossible to answer. But if we limit our language packs to just what you would need in common speech, rather than absolute fluency, we can come up with a reasonable guesstimate. This useful source says 75% of English is made up of a thousand word bases, and 90% is made up of 7000. So we could have two levels of fluency packs, but let's focus on the smaller one. The best way I can think of to organize these packs is to list all the words in some standard order, so #1 would be be, #2 would be go, and so on. If each word is allotted 8 letters, and the alphabet is limited to 32 letters (5 bits), that's 5 bytes per word. Multiply by 1000 is 5 KB for basic usability. For the larger pack, we should allot more letters, maybe 16, and round up to 8,192 words (computer nerds will know why). 10 bytes per word times 8,192 words makes an even 80 KB. This is not much! It would also need to include plenty of information about pronunciation, conjugations, tenses, word order, and other details that make languages different. I don't have such an easy way of estimating how much space that would take up, but based on the size of the dictionary I'm guessing you could cram it into a megabyte with room to spare. This is still not much! I've heard the capacity of the human brain cited as anywhere between three and 100 terabytes. Assuming a few gigabytes for the language base, You could easily cram thousands of languages into the brain without pushing out anything important. But of course, however it is your brain remembers English, it isn't like this. Your implants are a much better idea than trying to load the data directly into the brain - they can hold all those thousands of languages on a tiny 1GB builtin memory chip, and whenever you ask it for a particular word in a particular language, it looks in the dictionary, finds the word, applies the conjugation rules, converts it into whatever format brains use, and gives it back to you fully-formed. This completely bypasses the need for your brain to know any words at all. You use your knowledge of language in the abstract (which I'm assuming would be directly loaded, either through implants or school), and think to it, I need to know how to say the first-person singular present progressive form of to go in English, and your implant will look up go and see how to conjugate into the present progressive tense, in the first-person singular, and think back to you, I am going, and tell you how to pronounce it. Or it could do this one sentence at a time so it can handle all the grammar for you. TL;DR: 56. (Edit: that guy's a little dubious. 68 is better documented, and higher. 

The middle is right out. Consider the spine, and how the two spines would have to connect: There would have to be some sort of three-way vertebra (horse back, horse front, human). I've never heard of a split spine in any creature, so we have nothing to base this off. (There are mutant snakes with two heads, but these x-rays seems to show either a blob of bony material, which would be very heavy, or no proper connection at all, which would provide no support.) As one of the other answers mentioned, this would cause the horse spine to sag as the weight won't be supported directly over the legs. On the other hand, having the torso closer to the center of gravity might be more practical for maneuvering. (Semi-related: My favorite mythical creature, the Nuckelavee, has its torso in the middle. It also has no skin and breathes the plague, so it's not a great example of realism.) What about in the back? It would look absurd, for one. But internal organs are the big problem. There would be no practical mouth, unless you have a) a giant freaky gaping hole where the horse head should go, b) a horse head, which makes it not really a centaur, or c) use the human mouth, which requires a uselessly long esophagus running down its back along the spine, or reverse the internal organs front-to-back, which is just a centaur walking backwards. Additionally, the pelvis of the horse seems ill-equipped to support the weight of the human torso. Just look at those scrawny little coxa. More importantly, I can't see a good way to connect the human spine to the horse spine. The horse spine curves downward into the tail (which you would also have to find a way to deal with) but it needs to slope upward into the human spine and I think it needs more space to do that than the tiny space you can see in the picture, whereas the horse neck is already basically straight up. One other consideration for the middle and the back: What do you do with the horse head? With the front it's obvious that the human torso replaces the horse neck, but what else could you do with it? Just truncate the spine at the shoulder and have a rounded blob in front? That removes the need for several muscle groups, and probably a few bones. Keep the horse head? Like I said, not really a centaur anymore. You also have the problem of which brain is in charge of what. So torso in front is really the only sensible solution.
