Consider the groups $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ under addition and let $\phi:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow Aut(\mathbb{Q})$ be the mapping where $\phi(n)(r)=n\cdot 2^{r}$. Then $\phi$ is a group homomorphism. We can therefore define the semidirect product $\mathbb{Q}\times_{\phi}\mathbb{Z}$ by letting $(r,n)(s,m)=(r+\phi(n)(s),n+m)=(r+s\cdot 2^{n},n+m)$ and where $(r,n)^{-1}=(\phi(-n)(-r),-n)=(-r\cdot 2^{-n},-n)$. Then $\mathbb{Z}\times\{0\}$ is a subgroup of the group $\mathbb{Q}\times_{\phi}\mathbb{Z}$. On the other hand, $(0,1)(r,0)(0,-1)=(0,1)(r+2^{0}\cdot 0,-1)=(0,1)\cdot(r,-1)=(0+2^{1}\cdot r,0)$ making $(0,1)(\mathbb{Z}\times\{0\})(0,-1)=2\mathbb{Z}\times\{0\}$ a proper subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}\times\{0\}$ 

It is a well known result of Sierpinski that there exists non-measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ which intersect each line in at most two points. Furthermore, there exists a real-valued function whose graph is a non-measurable subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. 

A cardinal $\kappa$ is weakly compact if and only if $2^{\kappa}$ is $\kappa$-compact and $\kappa$ is strongly compact if and only if $2^{I}$ is $\kappa$-compact for all sets $I$ where $2^{I}$ is given the topology with basis of open sets of the form $[\sigma]$ where $\sigma:J\rightarrow 2$ and $|J|<\kappa$. To prove the tree property from the Tychonoff theorem characterization of weak compactness, one uses the following argument. Suppose that $T$ is a $\kappa$-tree. Then for each $\alpha<\kappa$, let $T_{\alpha}$ be the $\alpha$-th level of this tree. Then by a compactness argument, one can show that the inverse limit $\varprojlim_{\alpha<\kappa}T_{\alpha}\subseteq\prod_{\alpha<\kappa}T_{\alpha}$ is a non-empty closed subset (the proof of this fact is the same in the ordinary compactness case). However, $\varprojlim_{\alpha<\kappa}T_{\alpha}$ is the set of all $\kappa$-branches of $T$. Therefore $\kappa$ satisfies the tree property. To prove that every weakly compact cardinal satisfies the $\kappa$-Tychonoff theorem, one could use the tree property and inaccessibility to show that every $\kappa$-filter on a $\kappa$-algebra of sets can be extended to a $\kappa$-ultrafilter and from this fact one could show that weakly compact cardinals satisfy a $\kappa$-version of Alexander's subbase theorem. From Alexander's subbase theorem, one then establishes that weakly compact cardinals satisfy the $\kappa$-Tychonoff theorem. This result was originally proven in the paper Additions to some Results of Erdos and Tarski by Donald Monk and Dana Scott. Furthermore, a long list of characterizations of weak compactness including several topological characterizations is given in the book The Theory of Ultrafilters (1974). 

Let me give a construction that gives many locally compact spaces that are not normal. If $X$ is a completely regular space and $C$ is a compactification of $X$, then $X$ is paracompact if and only if $X\times C$ is normal. Therefore if $X$ is locally compact but not paracompact, then $X\times C$ is locally compact but not normal. Furthermore, the paracompact locally compact spaces are precisely the spaces that can be partitioned into a collection of $\sigma$-compact clopen sets (recall that a space is $\sigma$-compact if and only if it can be written as a countable union of compact sets). In particular, if $X$ is a connected locally compact space that is not $\sigma$-compact and $C$ is a compactification of $X$, then $X\times C$ is not normal. 

If $x\in X$, then define a mapping $x^{\sharp}:\textrm{crit}[X]\rightarrow \textrm{crit}[X]$ by letting $x^{\sharp}(\textrm{crit}(y))=\textrm{crit}(x*y)$. 

The linear orders which are compact in the order topology are precisely the complete totally ordered sets $X$. By complete I mean that every subset of $X$ has a least upper bound including $\emptyset$ and $X$. If $R\subseteq X$ has no least upper bound, then let $S$ be the set of all upper bounds of $R$. Then $\bigcup_{r\in R}\{x\in X|x<r\}\cup\bigcup_{s\in S}\{x\in X|x>s\}$ is an open cover with no finite subcover. For the converse, assume $X$ is a complete totally ordered set. Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a non-principal ultrafilter on $X$. Then for each $a\in X$ either $\{x\in X|a\leq x\}\in\mathcal{U}$ or $\{x\in X|a\geq x\}\in\mathcal{U}$. Let $A=\{x\in X|a\geq x\}\in\mathcal{U}$ and let $B=\{x\in X|a\leq x\}\in\mathcal{U}$. Then $A$ is downwards closed and $B$ is upwards closed and $\{A,B\}$ is a partition of $X$. Therefore there is some $x\in X$ where if $a\leq x$, then $a\in A$ and if $a\geq x$, then $a\in B$. Let $(a,b)$ be an interval around $x$. Then $a\in A,b\in B$, so $(a,1],[0,b)\in\mathcal{U}$, so $(a,b)=(a,1]\cap[0,b)\in\mathcal{U}$. Therefore $X$ is compact since every non-principal ultrafilter converges. 

Given a Boolean algebra $B$, I shall construct a theory whose Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is isomorphic to $B$. I do not know anything about intuitionistic logic, so I will answer this question just for first order logic and Boolean algebras. Let $B$ be a Boolean algebra. Let $V$ be the variety consisting of all algebras $(A,(c_{a})_{a\in B})$ such that $A$ is a Boolean algebra and $c_{a}\wedge c_{b}=c_{a\wedge b},c_{a}\vee c_{b}=c_{a\vee b},c_{0}=0,c_{1}=1$ whenever $a,b\in A$. Then $V$ is a variety. Let $T$ be the theory of all algebras $\mathcal{A}=(A,(c^{\mathcal{A}}_{a})_{a\in B})\in V$ such that $|A|=2$. I claim that the mapping $L:B\rightarrow Sent(T)$ given by $L(b)=[c_{b}=1]$ is a Boolean algebra isomorphism. Take note that $L(1)=[c_{1}=1]=1$ and $L(0)=[c_{0}=1]=0$. Furthermore, $$L(a)\wedge L(b)=[c_{a}=1]\wedge[c_{b}=1]=[c_{a}\wedge c_{b}=1]=[c_{a\wedge b}=1]=L(a\wedge b).$$ Furthermore, we have $L(a)\vee L(b)=[c_{a}=1]\vee[c_{b}=1]=[c_{a}\vee c_{b}=1]=[c_{a\vee b}=1]=L(a\vee b)$. Therefore $L$ is a Boolean algebra homomorphism. To show that $L$ is injective, suppose that $a\neq 1$. Then there is a Boolean algebra homomorphism $\phi:B\rightarrow 2$ with $\phi(a)=0$. In particular, if $\mathcal{A}=(2,(c^{\mathcal{A}}_{a})_{a\in B})$ and $c^{\mathcal{A}}_{b}=\phi(b)$ for $b\in B$, then $\mathcal{A}\models T$, but also $\mathcal{A}\models c_{a}\neq 1$. Therefore $L(a)=[c_{a}= 1]\neq 1$. We conclude that $L$ is an injective Boolean algebra since its kernel is trivial. Now assume that $\Phi$ is a sentence in $T$. It is easy to see that the theory of $T$ has quantifier elimination: We can simply replace a formula $\forall x\Phi(x)$ with $\Phi(0)\wedge\Phi(1)$ and $\exists x\Phi(x)$ with $\Phi(0)\vee\Phi(1)$. Therefore every sentence in the language of $T$ is equivalent to a quantifier free sentence. Furthermore, every quantifier free sentence in $T$ can easily be reduced to a sentence of the form $c_{a}= 1$. Therefore every sentence in the language of $T$ is equivalent modulo $T$ to a sentence of the form $c_{a}=1$. Therefore every element $[\Phi]$ in $Sent(T)$ is of the form $L(a)=[c_{a}=1]$ for some $a\in B$. In other words, the mapping $L$ is surjective. We conclude that $L$ is an isomorphism. 

the frames $L$ that extend a poset $X$ such that $L=\{\bigvee^{L}R|R\subseteq X\}$ can be characterized in terms of certain Grothendieck topologies on $X$ and are the most closely related to $X$ itself, and the only extension of a poset $X$ to a complete lattice $L$ such that $L=\{\bigvee^{L}R|R\subseteq X\},\{\bigwedge^{L}R|R\subseteq X\}$ is the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of $X$. 

The completely regular spaces $X$ such that every $G_{\delta}$ set has a non-empty interior are called almost $P$-spaces. The following facts will help you construct numerous examples of almost $P$-spaces. Recall that a $P$-space is a completely regular space where every $G_{\delta}$-set is open. Therefore, the notion of an almost $P$-space is a weakening of the notion of a $P$-space. If $X$ is locally compact and realcompact, then $\beta X\setminus X$ is an almost $P$-space (this fact generalizes the answer of Adam Prze≈∫dziecki). A completely regular space $X$ is an almost $P$-space if and only if its Hewitt Realcompactification $\upsilon X$ is an almost $P$-space. A product of spaces $X\times Y$ is an almost $P$-space if and only if both $X$ and $Y$ are almost $P$-spaces. It is easy to show that a dense subspace of an almost $P$-space is an almost $P$-space. However, a closed subspace of an almost $P$-space is not necessarily an almost $P$-space. In fact, every completely regular space can be embedded as a closed subspace of an almost $P$-space. If $B$ is a Boolean algebra, then the Stone space of $B$ is an almost $P$-space if and only if $B$ has no countable partitions. In particular, if $B$ is $\aleph_{1}$-saturated, then the Stone space $S(B)$ is an almost $P$-space. The papers 1,2 give more information on almost $P$-spaces (with the link to 2 provided by Mirko). For question 2, an example of a totally ordered almost $P$-space is given in Proposition 2.3 of 2. 

Let $A_{n}=(\{1,\ldots,2^{n}\},*_{n})$ be the algebra defined by $x*_{n}1=x+1\mod 2^{n}$ and $x*_{n}(y*_{n}z)=(x*_{n}y)*_{n}(x*_{n}z)$ for all $x,y,z\in\{1,\ldots,2^{n}\}$. Suppose that $X$ is a subalgebra of some $A_{n}$ and $\simeq$ is a congruence on $X$. Then does there necessarily exist some $m$ along with some embedding $i:(X/\simeq)\rightarrow A_{m}$? If so, then for all $n$, let $t_{n}$ be the least natural number $m$ such that whenever $X$ is a subalgebra of $A_{n}$ and $\simeq$ is a congruence on $X$, then there is some embedding $i:X/\simeq\rightarrow A_{m}$. Then what are some bounds on $t_{n}$? Or what is the exact value of $t_{n}$? 

$(X,F)$ is complete (as a uniform space,i.e. Every Cauchy filter converges). Every $F$-ultrafilter on the Boolean algebra $\mathfrak{B}^{*}(X,F)$ is of the form $\{R\in\mathfrak{B}^{*}(X,F)|x\in R\}$ for some $x\in X$. 

One proves Lemma 1 for each $x*y$ by a double induction which is descending on $x$ and for each $x$ the induction is ascending on $y$. In fact, many results about Laver tables are proven using a descending then ascending double induction. 

I claim that the lattice described above is a complete lattice if and only if $X$ is finite. Let $X$ be a countably infinite set. Assume that the set $\{\{R\}|R\subseteq X,|R|<\infty\}$ has a least upper bound $\mathcal{A}$. Put a relation $\simeq$ on $P(X)$ where $R\simeq S$ iff there is a bijection $f:X\rightarrow X$ with $f[R]=S$. Then if $R,S\subseteq X,R\simeq S$, then $R\in\mathcal{A}$ iff $S\in\mathcal{A}$. Therefore $\mathcal{A}$ is the union of a collection of equivalence classes. However, we take note that the equivalence classes are the sets of the forms $\{R\subseteq X:|R|=n\},\{R\subseteq X:|X\setminus R|=n\},\{R\subseteq X:|R|=|X\setminus R|=\infty\}$. However, the set $\mathcal{A}$ cannot contain more than one equivalence class since $\mathcal{A}$ must be an antichain. Therefore $\mathcal{A}$ is precisely one equivalence class. The set $\mathcal{A}$ cannot be any of the equivalence classes of the form $\{R\subseteq X:|R|=n\}$ since the sets $\{R\subseteq X:|R|=n\}$ are not upper bounds of $\{\{R\}|R\subseteq X,|R|<\infty\}$. Furthermore, $\mathcal{A}\neq\{R\subseteq X:|R|=|X\setminus R|=\infty\}$ since $\{R\subseteq X:|R|=|X\setminus R|=\infty\}$ is not an antichain. Therefore, $\mathcal{A}=\{R\subseteq X:|X\setminus R|=n\}$ for some $n$. On the other hand, $\{R\subseteq X:|X\setminus R|=n+1\}$ is another antichain and $\{R\subseteq X:|R|=n\}\leq\{R\subseteq X:|X\setminus R|=n+1\}<\{R\subseteq X:|X\setminus R|=n\}$, This contradicts the fact that $\mathcal{A}=\{R\subseteq X:|X\setminus R|=n\}$ is the least upper bound of $\{\{R\}|R\subseteq X,|R|<\infty\}$. Therefore the collection of antichains in $P(X)$ is not an complete lattice. What goes wrong? If $X$ is a set, then we say $L\subseteq P(X)$ is a lower set if whenever $R\in L$ and $S\subseteq R$, then $S\in L$ as well. Let $\mathcal{L}(X)$ denote the collection of lower sets in $X$. Then $\mathcal{L}(X)$ is clearly a complete lattice. For finite sets, the antichains are in a one-to-one correspondence with the lower sets by the following correspondences. If $A$ is an anti-chain, then one simply takes the lower set generated by $A$. If $L$ is a lower set, then the collection of all maximal elements in $L$ is an anti-chain. Therefore since $\mathcal{L}(X)$ is a complete lattice, the collection of all anti-chains also forms a complete lattice. On the other hand, for infinite sets, there are lower sets with no maximal elements such as the collection of all finite subsets of an infinite set $X$. Therefore this one-to-one correspondence breaks down for infinite sets.
