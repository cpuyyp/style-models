In the theory of tectonic plates, at a convergent boundary between a continental plate and an oceanic plate, the denser plate usually subducts underneath the less dense plate. It is well known that oceanic plates subduct under continental plates, and therefore oceanic plates are more dense than continental plates. My question is why are the oceanic plates always denser than the continental plates. I'm aware that the difference in density can be attributed to the plates differing compositions, but what I'm interested in is why these plates have different composition in the first place giving rise to their relative difference in densities. 

The image can also be seen from the google maps satellite here. What is responsible for this majestic illusion near the island? I have heard that it may be sand moving over the edge of an underwater cliff, and if so what causes the sand to be pushed off continuously without the process coming to a stop and what is responsible for this unique geographical landscape allowing this to occur? 

Here's some alternatives to matlab: 1) nasa has online calculator that spits out raw text tables of insolation. 2) If you are savvy with fortran then you may like this fortran code. 3) The fortran code above also has an online interface 4) If you like python, then you may like this python code, climlab, where there are detailed instructions here on how to use the code and visualize the information. 5) If you like R, then try palinsol which has a little documentation here. 

Convergent cross mapping (CCM) is a recently developed tool to answer the question you've asked. It's based on tools developed in nonlinear time series analysis and dynamical systems theory. It allows you to: 1) determine if a causal relationship between two variables is present 2) establish the direction of causality 3) do so even in the presence of noise. As for an interesting application, check out the paper Causal feedbacks in climate change [van Nes et al., 2015], where CCM is applied to co2 and temperature based on the Vostok data sets. EDIT: Below I've added a more detailed explanation of CCM to show the original poster that this technique does indeed answer their question, as well as to show it has a rigorous mathematical underpinning. The general idea of convergent cross mapping is based on phase space reconstruction [F. Takens, 1981],[H. Abarbanel, 1996]. Numbers 1 through 5 explain the idea behind phase space reconstruction, which is needed to understand CCM. Numbers 6 through 8 very briefly explain CCM. References are listed at the bottom for more depth. 1) A physical system that is described by a set of equations (e.g. conservation of mass, momentum, etc) has a phase space. The solution to the system of equations is a trajectory through (or subset of) the phase space. 2) An attractor is a subset of the phase space that the trajectories/solutions evolve toward. 3) If you know the governing attractor, then you have all solutions of the system for all time. 4) Taken’s theorem says that one can reconstruct the attractor of the system based on a single observable. For example, if temperature, pressure, and velocity are the three variables of the system, then you only need measurements from one of these variables to reconstruct the attractor of the system. State space reconstruction 5) The reconstructed attractor is not exactly the “true” attractor, but it has a direct 1:1 mapping to the true attractor. Taken's theorem 6) If two observables belong to the same system, then they each have a reconstructed attractor with a direct mapping to the true attractor. The reconstructed attractors also have a direct mapping to one another. Convergent cross mapping 7) It is then possible to make predictions on one observable, based on the reconstructed attractor of the other observable, if they are in fact from the same attractor (causally related). Time series and attractors 8) Last, a series of tests/predictions with the data help to establish the direction of, strength of, and linearity of the interactions between the two variables. This is detailed in the papers [sugihara et al., 2012] and [van Nes et al., 2015]. To answer your question "given two observed variables, how do you tell if an third variable is simply forcing the two observed variables, making them appear correlated? First, the process of phase space reconstruction would yield an estimate of the "embedding dimension", which is an estimate of the dimension of the phase space (how many variables there). In the CCM framework, a one-way forcing relationship between the two known variables (v1 and v2) would be attractor for v1 can make skillful predictions of v2, but attractor v2 can not make skillful predictions for v1. Contingent upon the situation where you have an idea of what the third variable is (v3), I think what you could do is the following, take the reconstructed attractor of v3 and make predictions on both v1 and v2, and show that v3 has more predictive power on v1 (compared to v2), and that v3 has more predictive power on v2 (compared to v1). I'm not sure about this though. Also, if the forcing (v3) is thought to be linear, you could simply remove/detrend v3 from v1 and v2, as is done when you remove seasonality from temperature data. Note: There is MATLAB code available to mess around with this technique. I believe you can find similar codes in R as well.

The Coriolis force predicts that winds in the northern hemisphere should be deflected in a clockwise pattern and winds in the southern hemisphere should be deflected in an anti-clockwise pattern. Why is it that in the case of cyclones however, the cyclones spin anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere? 

It is well known among regular beach goers that a sudden shoreline drawback is often a warning sign for an impending Tsunami. My understanding of Tsunamis is they they form as a result of the seafloor abruptly changing, causing a local vertical displacement of water at the site of above the disruption, which initiates the wave. 

What is the mechanism for snowflakes forming into these delightful symmetric hexagonal structures? Also what is the mechanism for the differing shapes in each of the different snow flakes? 

Background: The theory of mantle plumes is useful (although controversial) in explaining the occurrence of intra-plate volcanoes. The website here suggests that "hotspots" exist in fixed locations relative to one another in the core, and thus on a planet like Mars, where there are no tectonic plates, massive volcanoes will form above these "hotspots", but on Earth moving tectonic plates give rise to strings of volcanoes above underlying "hotspots". The quote below is from the linked website: 

This is a difficult question since time of concentration ($t_c$) can in theory, vary substantially, for two basins of equal size. Off the top of my head, I can imagine several other variables that would be necessary to determine $t_c$: drainage density, basin relief, basin length, surface roughness (Mannings coefficient), and rainfall statistics. There's certainly others too. I found a paper titled The characteristic time scale for basin hydrological response using radar data is freely available. There is a discussion of $t_c$ beginning on page 93 at bullet point number 2. They cite other papers in their discussion that would be worth tracking down and reading. Note they present an empirical equation for $t_c$: $$t_c=5.4\left(\frac{L}{S^{0.5}}\right)^{0.75}$$ L is basin length, and S is slope/relief. It's weird, yet I'm not surprised since it's empirical. Evidently the 5.4 has dimensions of $time$ and $length^{-0.75}$. It's hard to imagine that this equation would actually be useful. 

Given that the base of the picture is parallel to sea level, you can see that the line where the dark blue meets the red in the sky, is on an angle of elevation of approximately 7 - 8 degrees. Is there an explanation for this phenomenon (which I have observed for the past few days) and is it related to my position on the Earth, or the time of year? 

It is well known that the jet stream follows an overall meandering pattern, but what is less well known is that this meandering pattern itself moves as a wave with a velocity much slower than the velocity of the jet stream itself. So why does this meandering wave propagate, and what causes the meandering pattern in the first place? 

How does this process ultimately result in the shoreline often receding prior to the Tsunami reaching the coast? 

Notice how several different random walks spread apart with time? A random walk has the property that, the standard deviation of all walks together, grows with the square root of time. As in, the spread of all positions at a given point in time, grows proportionally to the square root of time. If the random walk wasn't random, but was constant instead, you would have a straight line (this is the case you described). So here is the first point to be made: a constant rate of precipitation leads to a linear increase in ice thickness, growing without bound. By adding in some randomness to approximate nature better, the rate at which the ice thickness grows is fractional with time rather than linear. A true random walk is still unbounded, and so there are clearly some negative feedback mechanisms at play as mentioned in the previous posts. Second point (actually answering your question). As this is a 2d surface, you could model glacial topography as 2D random field. In the absence of forcing, the dynamics of glacial topography is effectively a diffusion equation. A randomly forced diffusive surface has a natural (or internal) cutoff length scale, or scale above which ice won't grow. However, this cutoff scale would be a function of ice surface diffusivity, rather than a feedback mechanism between the system and forcing. So this is all to say, it could be a feedback mechanism, or it could be set internally by the material properties of the system. I'll look and see if anyone has written papers on this yet. The figure below shows an example of a 2D random field. I don't know how exactly it was generated, but it's basically the kind of solution you would get from a 2D diffusion equation with random forcing.
