During the mid-1800s improvements in naval armor and construction was progressing somewhat faster than that in naval guns. This made it difficult to sink ships. Even many years earlier, in the War of 1812, the USS Constitution was famous for having cannonballs bounce off her sides. The SMS Kaiser at the Battle of Lissa, though it was a wooden ship was very large, tough, and held together strongly with iron bolts. This made it hard to sink. Also, at the time, many of the ship guns were actually mortars, designed to fire exploding shells. These are great for killing people, but not so good at sinking ships. These considerations led the Austrian command at the battle to form the idea of rushing the Italians and engaging in a melee before the Italian gun fire could have an effect. This strategy succeeded, largely due to the incompetence of the Italians, many of whom were amateurs or had limited experience in naval warfare. When the Italian commodore returned after the battle he was indicted for incompetence. The results of the battle caused some naval designers to show an increased interest in "ramming" technology, but this was just a fad. It swiftly became apparent that guns with armor piercing rounds were a lethal answer to the those kinds of tactics, which were never again repeated. At the battle of Lissa, the Italians actually did have penetrating naval rifles, the right type of weapon, but unfortunately they were only of smaller caliber. If they had equipped their ships with larger caliber naval rifles and had had gunners who knew how to use them, the Austrians would have been annihilated, long before they got anywhere near the Italian ships. 

I completely agree with you that attacking South Georgia was a strategic error. What you have to realize is that the people making these decisions are humans, not robots, and often the reason for an action has more to do with politics than what is militarily optimal. Since South Georgia was more or less unoccupied, the Argentinian leaders could immediately announce a success by invading it and their would be no countervailing factors; no civilian deaths, no occupation issues, no chance of resistance. It would appear to be a completely "safe" victory. It is hard to resist the lure of safe victory, even if it has no strategic value. 

coleopterist has made a good answer, but I will add a few details that are less obvious and not easy to glean from the literature. First of all, the fiction that Columbus had discovered the Indies was maintained for quite long time, up to about 1520 when it became patently obvious that the two places were different. This fiction was maintained not because people were fooled by it, but because it was politically expedient. As long as people thought that Spain had reached the spice-rich Indies, it was beneficial to the crown. In truth, among experts and experienced navigators it was well known secretely almost immediately that Columbus had found some new place because it was known that the Arabs were widespread in Southeast Asia and these people were not present in the new world. After the first voyage of Columbus there was some question, because there was the possibility he had somehow found some remote, outlying islands of the Indies. However, when ships from Columbus' massive second expedition began returning in 1495 and 1496 it rapidly became clear to experts that it was a new place because the inhabitants were much more primitive than India was known to be and there were no Arabs there or any other ships (such as those from China) at all for that matter. Since there were no Indian, Chinese or Arab ships anywhere and the people were all naked savages with no knowledge of bronze or other technology, it was clear it was a new place. 

You are asking about four different commodities: Cotton: the West Indies was never an important source of cotton. Currently Barbados has a grand total of 214 acres of cotton under cultivation. That would be the tiniest of a one family farm in the United States. In 1902 there were 1200 acres under cultivation in Barbados, a microscopic amount. In 1800 there were hundreds of thousands of acres of cotton in India and the United States. Tobacco: same story as cotton, the amount of acreage in the United States has always dwarfed the Caribbean. Sugar: Sugar grows very well in the Caribbean and so it has always been an important producer and still is. At one time it was the dominant producer of sugar but this changed around 1820 due to the development of beet sugar technology and the abolition of the global slave trade by the British. It is notable that at the same time there was a huge decline in the city of Bristol, which previously had been a very wealthy port due to the sugar trade. Coffee: Coffee grows in a very wide variety of places so the Caribbean was never a dominant producer, but it does grow well there so at one time the plantations in the Caribbean were big producers of coffee. The decline of the plantations around 1820 due to the abolition of the slave trade caused the production of coffee to decline. Note that places like Columbia and Mexico have much better economies and support structures than the West Indies, so they tend to be able to produce and sell coffee more cheaply. In the Caribbean Puerto Rico has been best able to maintain its coffee industry due to the support from the United States. 

The problem is, who is Amyrtaios? According to official Egyptian history he is Amyrtaeus, a Saitic rebel who resisted Persian rule for 5 years between 404 and 399 BC. The problem with this is that this Amyrtaeus would not have been born yet when Herodotus was writing about him. Now, Herodotus says Moeris lived 900 years before himself and Amyrtaeus lived 700 years after Anysis who lived approximately 150-200 years after Moeris, therefore, Herodotus must have considered Amyrtaeus to be roughly contemporaneous with himself. 

First of all, swords are made from steel and casting steel is an advanced technology not available in the 17th century. Swords and all other steel tools are forged, which means that the steel ingot is hammered into shape. The rapier was original to Toledo and at one time that city exported swords to all parts of Europe. Later, of course, their work was widely imitated and you can find rapiers made all over. Besides Toledo, Solingen in Germany became known as a good producer. The distinguishing characteristic of the rapier is its strength and flexibility which was tested by bending the sword around the waist. This is only possible if the steel is very good quality and has manganese and is well tempered. Original rapiers were broader than what we call a rapier today, being more similar to what we now call an epee. The technique for making a true Toledo is a complex art which varied from swordmaker to swordmaker. The general strategy was to first hammer the ingot into a long strip which was then divided into three pieces. The pieces would then be forged together, the central one forming a core. Sword specialists call this type of construction a "welded" blade. By varying temperature of the core and the cladding it is possible to give the two parts a different temper which is essential to the suppleness of the sword. Finally the sword would be given a final tempering to harden the edge. 

I guess I will weigh in here because the other answers do not fully explain the situation. First of all, the word pronounced byel-yih means "white" in Russian. Traditionally in Russia white is the color associated with what is noble and good, whereas black (chorny) is the color of what is low and mean. So, all things noble were described as white, and things brutish black. So, for example, a Czarist fief immune from taxes would be a "white estate" and a vassal estate subject to taxes would be a "black estate". Likewise, capital cities where the noble lived would be "white cities" like Belgrade, for example, but a ramshackle or occupied city would be a "black city". Thus, "white russia" simply means the good part of Russia and this part of the country has been called that for at least 500 years. Though the above is the ancient historical consensus, there are divergent explanations. For example, the geographer and antiquarian Simon Staravolski wrote the following (1734): 

The border changes between the Soviet Union and China between 1917 and 1945 seem to be very complicated. At the end, in 1945, the Soviet Union invaded Manchuria wholeheartedly, and in violation of their neutrality pact with Japan, seizing huge swaths of land. Did the Soviet Union later return this territory to China? What was the net change from 1917 to 1945? Did the Russia/Soviet Union end up even larger by 1945, or did China expand at the expense of the old Russia Empire? 

The ancient Romans did not use deeds, they used a registration system. The document cited by Semaphore is not a deed, it is a conveyance (everybody now run to the Wikipedia and find out what a conveyance is). Roman land was surveyed and divided by stone markers called limites. In some places the land was divided into regular squares called centuriae. In those cases the owner of each square was recorded. Other times, the land was in irregular bounds, in which case it was individually recorded. There were two main types of records: the subseciva (land owned by the empire/government) and beneficia (land owned by individuals). In well-established places these lists were recorded on bronze plaques, and in more temporary situations they were recorded on wood or other less permanent materials. The example you give would never happen because the ownership of land and its bounds were recorded, so the taxpayer would not have needed to prove anything. The most common source of problems concerning land ownership in ancient Roman involved the culinae, which were public commons located on the outskirts of towns in the margins between the town and regularly owned farmland. This land was supposed to be for the use of the poor in the town, but in many cases adjoining farmers appropriated this land unjustly, leading to disputes of various kinds. There is an ancient document called the Corpus Agrimensorum Romanorum which describes Roman surveying and recording practices in detail.
