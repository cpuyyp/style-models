Otherwise, message integrity is lost and the received message cannot be trusted to be the message you sent. 

I am not sure what XYZ is working on... Not sure how this decision was implemented... Recent race condition due to data not being in sync 

Also any communication to him showing you object to his behavior should also be in written form so later he cannot deny you wrote it. By keeping documentation, you create a paper trail that can only help you and avoids he said / she said. Do not editorialize, but simply stick to the fact of what was said / written by this harasser. 

If your company is using DLP the second point above is somewhat mitigated, but preventative policies to prevent such a situation is much better 

A good practice is to centralize access by tying all available access to Microsoft Active Directory (AD) for the machines that run Windows. Benefits of approach: 

After such an analysis, you can meet with the management team and present to them the impact and cost of not having adequate resources to maintain system uptime. An example of what you can say: 

The problems you mention here and in most of your previous posts seem to concern lack of support / over-competiveness / lack of a open work culture. Hence, next time I would ask questions to better understand the culture of the company at the interview such as: 

I work as an IT auditor. I am currently working on an risk assessment for PCI and testing evidence to prepare for filing the annual compliance report. A team member who I mentored in the past has asked me whether he can be assigned one of the more difficult / technically complex items to work on. Although his skills has improved during the time I have been working with him, I still do not feel they are sufficient. PCI certification report will be externally facing, so the consequence of false assurance are high and very visible. Professional guidelines on audit supervision - state I should ensure the people who perform an attestation function have the necessary skills to do the job reliably. I am glad he is taking initiative to help the team, so I do not want to discourage his efforts in the future. As he is diligent and hard working, perhaps next year his skills will have become sufficient for me to delegate this task to him. How do I tell that I must decline his request to take on this task this time due to inadequate experience in accordance with professional guidelines? 

What are the job roles of employees that have the ability to modify / remove code from repository? Are incompatible duties segregated such developers having direct access to production? Is testing and documentation of results required before deploying code to production? How reliable are the rollback / restore procedures in case a change made were to crash the system? 

I work as the team lead for my team. Today I received a gift of boxed wine from a fellow team lead of another team that I worked closely with for the past year, as a symbol of goodwill for the upcoming holidays. Last year, I lost my girlfriend to a DWI driver and as a result personally feel very uncomfortable accepting this gift. I do not drink, and the gift brings back painful memories. I simply said I do not drink and that personal for reasons, I cannot accept the gift. I also stressed I appreciated the show of goodwill and thanked him for his intentions. However, my coworker appeared embarrassed which I did not intend. This is an issue I am not willing to compromise on and want to remain firm. Could there be better ways of declining a gift from a coworker due to a personal reason? How could I have mitigated any discomfort for the coworker? 

As soon as the AD account is disabled, any subsequent requests to authenticate from the client to the domain controller via ticket granting ticket(TGT) will fail. This minimizes human error in forgetting to revoke some access. If your company users SQL server for databases, by setting authentication to Windows mode, as soon as AD is disabled, no access to SQL server and hence database is possible. As a bonus, security risks inherent in SQL Server implementation such as the default SA account is auto-disabled. To make sure, that the AD account is disabled timely, your mail application can be programmed to auto send a copy of all termination requests to you, minimizing human error of forgetting to revoke access. 

I urge you to be very cautious and to document fully the request in written form if feasible. Working as an IT auditor, timestamps are one key piece of information I rely on when conducting internal controls testing. It is entirely possible that the request is benign, but it is also possible that the request to you is in an attempt at collusion between business and IT as part of an illegal fraud. If you make the change, when the changes are audited, your name will be (or should be if change management controls are working) associated with the change. Albeit how unlikely the possibility, the possibility the motivation is unscrupulous exists. You should find out the reason for the request, and if you suspect its questionable, don't make the change. Ask yourself: "Do I want my name and reputation to be tainted as an accomplice to illegal / unethical activity? 

On several instances, at work reliability issues with applications have caused decreases productivity. The unavailability of a system have affected other members of the team. To give an example, I was trying to validate change documentation in our JIRA system today to make sure that code defects were documented and resolved prior to production deployment from sandbox. As a result of application downtime, I will be squeezed to complete the work by the end of the week. HelpDesk supported is contracted. One of my goals in discussion is to have application support / HelpDesk support become more efficient to minimize downtime in the future. How do I discuss this with my manager that lack of system reliability is affecting work? 

I am recent graduate student who have secured a stable position at a financial firm. I have posted my resumes on online sites such as Monster, Dice, Indeed etc to aid employer exposure during my job search. Is it advisable for me to take my resumes down or at least make it private so its invisible to recruiters / employers? Loyalty, given satisfaction with current role, is a very important part of professionalism and one's character. Leaving online resumes in public view goes against this loyalty concept. On the other hand, however, it is a good idea not to take one's job for granted and be open in case one's current job goes under. What is accepted view in regard to this matter? 

Several days ago, I interviewed a candidate as part of a team for a Info Sec. analyst position. I myself work in IT Audit. One of the questions I asked was: 

I think the key to answering this are whether anyone else knows about this email and to what extent prior experience for the role is a necessity. If there is anyone else who may have known about this email, and are involved in the hiring process, then I suggest you recuse yourself, because as you said, bias is a real concern. The others involved may feel the email unfairly influenced your assessment of the candidate, whether or not this is the case. The other point is that the candidate's sister mentioned that he does not have much prior experience in this role you are hiring for. Depending on how important prior experience is to the role under consideration, this factor may by itself disqualify further consideration of him from the hiring process. 

You need to show your boss the risks of not having a dedicated system administrator, as was hinted at in the answer from @ Gvo. I will take each of the points you made and outline the business risk I see. 

If the above is what is actually happening, this suggests weaknesses in the UAT testing / user training phase of the development process. It appears that end users are not provided with an opportunity to validate that what was developed is what actually wanted. Again, this ties in to my first point in that there may not have been a clear definition of what is wanted due to lack of requirements sign off before development. 

If I understand you correctly, the task you are given has an dependency that is unavailable ATM. My advice is to work on other related tasks that does not depend on the dependency such as drafting of the application documentation. High level aspects such as describing the business purpose, outlining the architecture..building example use cases seem to be tasks you can do and are good to include in the documentation to your application. To give you an example, I was evaluating some change management documentation for an recently launched application at my employer. Testing evidence by QA was missing for some changes migrated to PROD. Several developers who had worked on the programming were unavailable on PTO. Accepting there will be a delay in getting this information, I moved to other key aspects elements of the review such as checking SoD, proper approval, authorized access etc... If push comes to shove, you might need to escalate such as physically going over to his work station (assuming both of you are in the same office). Hope this helps and good luck! 

If your company has the robust technology to support it, passwords should be hashed using a strong algorithm. The email itself should be sent encrypted. Avoid using SSL and early version TLS as the encryption method as these are longer considered secure. AES can be used to encrypt symmetrically or a algorithm like RSA can be used to encrypt asymmetrically (2 keys) Secure emails with sensitive information should be digitally signed so that the recipient can verify the authenticity of the sender and to ensure non - repudiation by the sender. A one way hash function such as HMAC-SHA 256 is applied to transform email into a cryptographic message digest. Do not sign using the SHA 1 algorithm as such algorithm has been cryptographically broken and is no longer secure as a result. Using PKI, a private key only you know is used to encrypt. Once the receiver uses your public key to decrypt, the resulting message hash should be the same. The public key is protected from tampering by a certificate that binds the identity of the owner with his / her public key. The certificate is obtained via a CA upon validating the credentials you supplied in your certificate request. 

As an IT auditor myself this behavior is unprofessional and unethical. My job when doing internal audits or an external audit for a client is to help them improve, and not to harm the business I am auditing. The business would certainly want to know about serious risks or deficient processes that endanger the business. As an example, by reporting to management that privileged access control is weak, or software change management is is inadequate through tangible evidence gathered from testing, I am doing a valuable favor to my client. I am bound by my profession' guidelines regarding Evidence and per the guidelines, in the case I am not able to obtain sufficient evidence for the basis of my opinion due to non cooperation of the auditee, I must attempt to obtain evidence by other means if possible and disclose to management. Management should be reasonable to understand that by deliberately hindering my work, I will be digging deeper for the information I requested. It is a non - disputable fact that the business wants to survive. My goal is to assist them by bringing to light obstacles that hinder the business meeting their ultimate goal of survival. Non cooperation only hurts the management of the business - an irrational decision.
