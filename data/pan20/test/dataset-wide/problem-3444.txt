In economics, people usually use mathematics as an intermediary to understand some economic mechanisms that would be difficult to understand without maths. Economists usually focus more on mechanisms in an analytic way than some historical facts in these mechanisms. That's a little bit what it is said "homo economicus" Youtube Lecture Link This link could be interesting for you but I don't know really (and don't think) some mainstream orthodox economists interested in the link between anthropology and economics. 

There are several reasons from supply and demand side. From production side, for example, contrary to anouncement of cutting production (from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Qatar), Saudi Arabia continued to increase its production. (There are some political reasons behind like Saudi Arabia would like to make some pressure on Russia and USA but I don't enter into this discussion as it does not concern an economic mechanism.) Also, there are some other countries like Canada, Iraq and Iran where the oil production rises, which pushes prices to fall. (I think you can easily find some data about that, I have seen somewhere in web.) From demand side, there is a risk of deflation in Europe and contraction of demand in most of developping countries, which also affects production side and could make a downward pressure on energy prices. Another reason could be use of energy efficient technologies (like some cars or machines in some industries.) What theory says about this issue ? In fact, the existing literature on environmental economics says that price of exhaustible resources tends to increase as they become scarce. (it is the famous Hotelling rule) There is a relationship between the use of renewable energies and exhaustible resources. Normally, an economy starts with use of exhaustible resources. Theory says that when economy grows in time, the exhaustible resource becomes scarce and its price increases. In this case, economy will use exhaustible resources until the marginal benefit from its use is equal to price of backstop (solar, wind etc...) (A very interesting paper to see about subject is Withagen and Van der Ploeg (JEEM-2012)) In this current situation, it is sure that there are less incentives for economies to switch to clean technologies as price of exhaustible resources decreased to much. To respond to your question, the use of renewable energy is increasing in world but I don't think at all that the huge fall in oil prices is due to "increasing" use of renewables. This trend for renewables is always present since some decades but until now, oil prices have always increased. As I have tried to explain, I don't really think there are robust correlations between the drop of oil prices and renewable energy use. 

Imagine that the A pill immunizes you against malaria for a day and the B pill immunizes you for a year. Would you say a plant producing 100 A pills produces more than a plant producing a B pill? I would argue in some sense it does, in some sense it does not. There is no absolutely clear method of comparison. For reasons of international trade, value is used. Is the word size confusing? Perhaps. But not overly so. 

Similarly in the Solow model one assumes that consumers save a constant portion of their income, without any utility calculations. By simulating models with different behavioral rules one may find a model which is a good approximation of reality or one may find a simple rule which would make near optimal decisions. While ABM is more flexible, that flexibility is also a problem: There is a myriad of heuristics to chose from, and different heuristics frequently lead to wildly different outcomes. 

The statement is not true. Let $x_A + x_B = 1$, $y_A + y_B = 1$. Let $U_A(x_A,y_A) = x_A + \ln(y_A)$, $U_B(x_B,y_B) = x_B + \ln(y_B + 1)$. $f \neq g$ are both strictly increasing & concave. For all $z \in [0,1]$ the distributions $$ (x_A,y_A) = (z,1), \ (x_B,y_B) = (1-z,0). $$ are Pareto-efficient. This follows from $MRS_A(x_A,y_A) \geq MRS_B(x_B,y_B)$. In these cases $y_A \neq y_B$. 

Another interesting issue could be on intertemporal elasticity of substitution and risk aversion. There are lots of experimental studies that you can find easily on econbiz or in similar websites. Also some other interesting studies focus on time inconsistency. You can find some famous articles by Laibson and Hepburn. 

There are lots of good courses (economics, math etc.) on MIT OpenCourseware or interestingly, there are also very very good lectures in YouTube. But I think the web site for MIT opencourseware is a real treasure. (at least for me). 

I think I proved in a rigorous way that the system is autonomous for the model that I have written 3-4 days and I think it is useful for the community, especially for those who are working on macroeconomics of growth. Let's write the present-value Hamiltonian ; $$\mathcal{H}=e^{-\triangle}\left[ U\left( c\right)\right] +\lambda _{2}^{}\left[ f(k)-c\right] +\lambda _{2}\left[ \rho +h(k)\right] $$ We know that ; $$\dot{\lambda}_{1}=- \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial k}$$ $$\dot{\lambda}_{2}=- \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial \triangle}$$ When I differenciate Hamiltonian according to time $t$ ; $$\frac{d \mathcal{H}}{dt}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial t} + \mathcal{H}_k \dot{k} + \mathcal{H}_{\lambda_1} \dot{\lambda}_{1} + \mathcal{H}_\triangle \dot{\triangle} + \mathcal{H}_{\lambda_2} \dot{\lambda}_{2} $$ It is straightforward to see that this term reduces to the following one ; $$\frac{d \mathcal{H}}{dt}=\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial t}$$ From page 299, theorem 9.6.1 of LÃ©onard and Dockner (Optimal Control Theory and Static Optimization in Economics) about the transversality condition which shows that $$\underset{t\rightarrow\infty}{lim}\mathcal{H}\left(t\right)=0$$ when $\rho > 0$ In this case, it is obvious that along the optimal path, the Hamiltonian takes the value 0, which ensures a autonomous dynamical system. 

Buy and sell rates are different because the currency vendor wants to make a profit and is also taking some risk with the exchange. It is possible that she cannot unload all the CADs they buy from you immediately and then perhaps in the future they will depreciate. (Perhaps they will appreciate. It is uncertain, hence there is risk.) The same applies to buying and selling euros. Usually there is some middle rate $x$ EUR/CAD. The vendor will deviate 1-2% from this in the direction favorable to her, depending on the direction of the deal (buying EURs with CAD or the other way around). You can look up something close the middle rate on XE. Currently this is about 1.394 CAD/EUR. Your vendor seems to sell at a premium that seems higher than normal to me, so perhaps see if you can find another currency merchant. 

The two demand functions $D_1(p),D_2(p)$ cross at the point $(Q,p)$. Their respective elasticities at price $p$ are \begin{align*} \epsilon_1(p) & = \frac{\text{d}D_1(p)}{\text{d}p}\frac{p}{D_1(p)} \\ \\ \epsilon_2(p) & = \frac{\text{d}D_2(p)}{\text{d}p}\frac{p}{D_2(p)}. \end{align*} However since both function cross at the point $(Q,p)$ we know that $$ D_1(p) = D_2(p) = Q. $$ But then $$ \frac{p}{D_1(p)} = \frac{p}{Q} = \frac{p}{D_2(p)}. $$ Meaning the only difference between their elasticities is $\text{d}D_i(p)/\text{d}p$, which is their slopes. As for your 1. question, the conditions are not clear. Is the 'flatter' curve only 'flatter' locally, or for every price $p$? If you only mean locally, then no, the statement is only valid in the intersection point $(Q,p)$. 

You can find easily the effect of a decrease by making a comparative static analysis. First, I just write the steady state value of $k$. (Note that you have made a little mistake in your calculation for $k^{SS}$ and in your Euler equation for technical progress, there is no $\theta$ in front of $g$.) $$k^{SS}=\left(\frac{\alpha}{\rho+n+\delta+g}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ After, I plug into the steady state level of consumption and I find ; $$\left(\frac{\alpha}{\rho+n+\delta+g}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}}-n\left(\frac{\alpha}{\rho+n+\delta+g}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ Then, you can easily find the effect of a decrease in population growth by differentiating $k^{SS}$ abd $c^{SS}$ with respect to $n$ and find the effect. The effect of an increase in $n$ will surely decrease the steady state level of capital but this effect is ambiguous for consumption at steady state. 

I have hesitated to put my answer as an answer or comment. First of all, you could get interesting insights by looking at Thomas Pikkety's seminal work (even if he got some severe critics by a large group of economists.) To tell very succintly, he suggests to tax heavily ultra billionnaires as he thinks that inequality will finally cause social tensions etc. I think your question depends on how to spend. Spending on luxury goods or spending on investment ? If they stop to invest in real sector and put their wealth on financial equities etc, it will surely affect the whole economy. If these billionnaires have some big factories, it will also affect unemployment rate and so on. 

From the basic equation you get \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{e^E_{t+1}}{e_{t}} & = & \frac{1+i_t}{1+i^*_t} \\ \\ (1+i^*_t) \cdot e^E_{t+1} & = & (1+i_t) \cdot e_t \\ \\ e^E_{t+1} - e_t & = & i_t \cdot e_t - i^*_t \cdot e^E_{t+1}. \end{eqnarray*} Now comes the approximation. You divide either by $e_t$ or by $e_{t+1}^E$. First method $$ \frac{e^E_{t+1} - e_t}{e_t} = i_t - i^*_t \cdot \frac{e^E_{t+1}}{e_t} \approx i_t - i^*_t. $$ Second method $$ \frac{e^E_{t+1} - e_t}{e^E_{t+1}} = i_t \cdot \frac{e_t}{e^E_{t+1}} - i^*_t \approx i_t - i^*_t. $$ I would say there is no crucial difference, both of these just assume that the proportional change in the exchange rate multiplied by the interest rate is an order of magnitude lower than either the interest rate or the change in the exchange rate alone. 

An answer that meets all the current demands of the question: Let $(x_b,y_b)$ be the blisspoint. Let $$ U(x,y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & \mbox{ if } (x,y) = (x_b,y_b) \\ 0 & \mbox{ if } (x,y) \neq (x_b,y_b). \end{array}\right. $$ The demand function for $x$ in this case is $$ D_x(I,p_x,p_y) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} x_b & \mbox{ if } p_x \cdot x_b + p_y \cdot y_b \leq I \\ \left[0,\frac{I}{p_x}\right] & \mbox{ if } p_x \cdot x_b + p_y \cdot y_b > I. \end{array}\right. $$

If the steady state curve of consumption depends on the physical capital, then the $\dot{c}$ will not be equal to zero. Especially, in models with endogenous discount, the steady state curve of consumption is not a vertical line. Here is an example : $URL$ 

Normally, in the Solow model, there are not increasing marginal returns because by construction, Solow model assumes that marginal return of capital is decreasing. In fact this feature ensures the catch up between countries? which is the main insight of this model. There is another branch of literature on endogeneous growth models which has taken into account the constant and increasing marginal returns of capital due to different externalities coming from education, infrastructure, accumulation of knowledge etc. To reply to your question, technically the marginal return of capital is increasing if you assume $\alpha-1>0$. Because in this case, for each additional unit of capital that you have, the marginal productivity will increase. In the case with decrasing MPK (case with $\alpha-1<0$ ), you will see that when $lim_{k\rightarrow\infty}MPK=0$ 

If you intend to work on economic history, it could be not very useful but let's say, if you will work on macroeconomics, growth theory, you should have a good enough knowledge for optimal control theory, which could be considered as a branch of calculus of variation. Also, probability and statistics are very useful courses if you intend to work on uncertainty, finance or macroeconomics or stochastic calculus. As a nutshell, all these are tools that economists use for doing formal economics. There are some advices of Thomas Sargent on this topic that could be relevant for you. Here is the link ; $URL$ 

Here $$\not\exists\;x_i^\star\; s.t.\; u_i(\alpha x_i)\geq u_i(\alpha x_i^\star)\;\forall i\;\text{and}\;u_i((1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)\geq u_i((1-\alpha)x_i^\star)$$ $$\implies\not\exists\;x_i^\star\;s.t.\;u_i(\alpha x_i^\star+(1-\alpha)x_i^\star)\geq u_i(\alpha x_i+(1-\alpha)\hat{x}_i)$$ you assume that the function $u$ is linear. Unfortunately the statement is false for non-linear utility functions. Try $$ U_1(x_1,y_1) = x_1 \cdot y_1^2 \hskip 20pt U_2(x_2,y_2) = x_2^2 \cdot y_2. $$ Given 1 unit of $x$ and $y$ each, the allocations $$ (x_1,y_1) = (1,1) \hskip 20pt (x_2,y_2) = (0,0) $$ and $$ (x_1',y_1') = (0,0) \hskip 20pt (x_2',y_2') = (1,1) $$ are both Pareto-optimal. However the points on the connecting $x = y$ line are not. You can verify this by comparing $MRS_1$ and $MRS_2$ for points on the line. Hence the Pareto-set is not convex in this case. (It is a curve connecting the two extreme allocations given above.) 

I have not read this paper in full, I am merely guessing based on some parts. It seems to me that agent $ij$ is short for "agent $j$ for player $i$". A player's strategy assigns a move/choice of action to each information set $I^{ij}$. Depending on the story of the game you can think about this move as being executed by the player herself or maybe just agents of the player. Kind of like with subgame perfection you can assume that the strategy must fullfil some conditions in each information set $I^{ij}$. When explaining these conditions it is easier to assume that the player does not have independent but somehow 'logically restricted beliefs' in every information set, but that all her agents have 'logically restricted beliefs'. So an agent $ij$ is basically just a player's strategy in $I^{ij}$. By 'logically restricted beliefs' I mean the restrictions posed on conjectures. 

Applied Intertemporal Optimization by Klaus WÃ¤lde is a very very nice book, even for those who are not really familiar with mathematics. The book treats deterministic and stochastic models, both in discrete and continuous time. I would really say for this book "Dynamic Optimization for dummies". I was not familiar at all with dynamic optimization but this book let me to get through. 

There exists also a tendancy to treat growth models with heterogeneous agents. I think the question is not to use the right growth model but contribute to the theory by trying to change "representative agent" framework. That's why there exists so many growth models with heterogeneous agents in recent years. I don't think at all that endogenous growth models are better than Solow-Swan exogenous growth models. Using one of these models depends on what you are trying to show as an economic mechanism. For example, if you are interested by some economic questions as "how it could be possible to maintain a growth path in a developping country ?", sure that it will be more appropriate to use an endogenous model. 

In fact, saddle path equilibrium is one of the most common equilibrium in canonical growth models, mainly in dynamic optimization problems. It is possible that he makes a reference to a decentralized equilibrium without cycles around steady state. Otherwise, if there are cycles around a steady-state equilibrium. It means that there are oscillations (see indeterminacy and bifurcation issues for technical details), which means that your equilibrium is not a saddle path. (I skip the mathematical details for those technical terms, which is beyond the scoop of your question.) In which situation, you don't have a saddle path equilibrium and some cycles around steady state ? A decentralized market economy with externalities which are not taken into account by agents in the market can show indeterminate equilibrium. I think he makes reference to this kind of economy. A very good and illustrative paper to respond to your question is Benhabib and Farmer (1994) I quote one of their sentences from introduction. Then, you can look at references cited ; "...Previous work on indeterminate equilibria has shown that stable steady states are associated with rational expectations models in which there exists a continuum of self-fulfilling belief-driven equilibria each of which is stationnary..." Hope it answers to your question.
