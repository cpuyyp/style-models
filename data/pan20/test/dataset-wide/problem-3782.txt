So as a set, $\pi_2^{C_n}(S^2)=\mathbb{Z} \sqcup \mathbb{Z}$. For the second one, I have a 1-cell of fixed points at $(x,y,z)=(t,t,t)$, my three 2-cells are the half-planes through that 1-cell and one of the three axes, and my three 3-cells fill in the rest. The 1-cell needs to be sent to fixed points, and these are still just $0$ and $\infty$, so by continuity it's all sent to $\infty$. So the image of a 2-cell is just an element of $\pi_2(S^2)$. Once we choose that (which determines the images of the other 2-cells, of course) we can always extend to the 3-cells, since these are just homotopies from a map to itself. Once we've chosen one, any other gives an element of $\pi_3(S^2)=\mathbb{Z}$. So as a set, $\pi_3^{C_3}(S^2)=\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$. So, my first question is: Are these right? Also, I've learned to compute (usual) homotopy groups of spheres by making a Postnikov tower, and I'm wondering if there's a sufficiently easy example for the equivariant case where I can do the analogous calculations by hand without the full generality of slice cells or whatever's going on (those could be the wrong words -- I don't think I understand what these are well enough to know whether this is a decent request, either). In any case, I'd love suggestions of better/more instructive examples. Lastly, I'm wondering if there are actually group structures here. In the first example, it looks like I can reasonably hope to add guys that are both in the same copy of $\mathbb{Z}$, but not otherwise. I think it's easy to show that there's no $C_n$-equivariant coproduct on $S^2$. On the other hand, quotienting by the plane $x+y+z=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ looks like it gives a $C_3$-equivariant coproduct on $S^3$. If two elements came from the same choice of $\pi_2(S^2)$, then there's an obvious origin for the $\pi_3(S^2)$-torsor, namely using the trivial homotopy to extend the map over the 3-cells. I think this agrees with my equivariant coproduct, just because it matches up with the usual picture you draw of how to add elements of $\pi_2$ (two squares sitting on top of each other). However, I can't tell whether this makes any sense when the elements came from different choices of $\pi_2(S^2)$. It seems like if it does work at all, there might be something funnier than the obvious group structure... 

As for Lagrange multipliers (taking the geometric interpretation of the gradient as given), I think the best way to see what's going on is to consider the 2-variable case. The idea is that you're generally constrained to some curve g(x,y)=0 (which is just a particular level curve of the function g(x,y)). Consider the level curves of the objective function f(x,y). If, moving along the constraint curve, we happen to be crossing one of these level curves of f(x,y), then (subject to the constraint) we are either increasing or decreasing the value of f(x,y). Therefore, we cannot be at a local extremum. So, a local extremum must occur where g(x,y)=0 is tangent to a level curve of f(x,y). This is equivalent to the condition that vectors perpendicular to the curves point in the same direction: grad(f)=λgrad(g). 

I recently noticed that there are two senses in which colimits are functorial, and I'm curious about their interplay. Let $C$ be a cocomplete category. Then, on the one hand, for any diagram category $I$ we have a functor $\mathrm{colim} : \mathrm{Fun}(I,C) \to C$ (left adjoint to the "constant $I$-shaped diagram" functor). But then also, colimits are functorial for maps of categories over $C$: for any pair of composable arrows $$ I \xrightarrow{F} J \xrightarrow{G} C , $$ we obtain an induced map $$\mathrm{colim}_I(GF) \to \mathrm{colim}_J(G)$$ in $C$ (by the universal property of $\mathrm{colim}_I(GF)$). These two situations can be unified: ignoring set-theoretic issues (and I guess maybe coherence issues too), there is a functor $$ \mathrm{Cat}^{op} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Fun}(-,C)} \mathrm{Cat} , $$ whose corresponding Grothendieck fibration $$ X_C \to \mathrm{Cat} $$ has as its fiber over $I \in \mathrm{Cat}$ the functor category $\mathrm{Fun}(I,C)$, while its cartesian arrows select pullbacks. Thus, I would expect that "colimit" should assemble to a functor $$ X_C \xrightarrow{\mathrm{colim}} C $$ whose restriction to each fiber is a left adjoint. Has anyone studied this sort of thing? 

The universal coefficient theorem yields $H^n(L;\pi)\cong Hom(H_n(L),\pi)$. The Hurewicz homomorphism $h:\pi \rightarrow H_n(L)$ is an isomorphism, and its inverse $h^{-1}\in Hom(H_n(L),\pi)$ corresponds to $\iota_L\in H^n(L;\pi)$. We have a canonical bijection $H^n(L;\pi) \cong [L,K(\pi,n)]$. Any $[f]\in [L,K(\pi,n)]$ corresponds to $f^*\iota\in H^n(L;\pi)$, where $\iota\in H^n(K(\pi,n);\pi)$ is the fundamental class of $K(\pi,n)$ (which is associated to its identity map). This is actually a group isomorphism if we add maps on the right side by using the fact that $K(\pi,n)=\Omega K(\pi,n+1)$ (or at least $\simeq$, although what does $K(\pi,n)$ even mean really). I'd imagine that this is canonical too, but I don't know for sure. We have a map $[L,K(\pi,n)]\rightarrow Hom(\pi,\pi)$ given by $[f]\mapsto f_\#$. Presumably the idea is to show that the image of $\iota_L$ is an isomorphism, but I can't tell if I'm just complicating the question by phrasing it in these terms. 

I'd like to interpret this to mean that the objects of $Shv(\mathscr{M})$ are associated to 1-morphisms $\mathscr{M} \rightarrow \mbox{Sh}$, and that the morphisms of $Shv(\mathscr{M})$ are associated to 2-morphisms in $Hom_{Stacks}(\mathscr{M},\mbox{Sh})$, which in turn should be the same as 1-morphisms $\mathscr{M} \rightarrow \mbox{Sh-map}$. But there a number of problems with this. First, given a sheaf $\mathcal{F} \in Shv(\mathscr{M})$ I'm having trouble constructing a natural transformation $\mathscr{M} \rightarrow \mbox{Sh}$. Perhaps I shouldn't, but to check this I'm using a test object $X\in \mathcal{C}$. By Yoneda, an object of $\mathscr{M}(X)$ is the same as a 1-morphism of stacks $f:X\rightarrow \mathscr{M}$, and so I obtain an object of $Sh(X)$ (i.e. a sheaf on $\mathcal{C}/X$) via $(\alpha:Y\rightarrow X) \mapsto \mathcal{F}(f\alpha:Y \rightarrow X \rightarrow \mathscr{M})$. That's natural enough. Again by Yoneda, a morphism in $\mathscr{M}(X)$ is a 2-morphism between maps $f,g:X\rightarrow \mathscr{M}$ of stacks, i.e. a section $s:X\rightarrow X\times_\mathscr{M} X$ of the projection from the 2-category fiber product. Out of this, I'm supposed to construct a natural transformation from the sheaf $(\alpha:Y\rightarrow X) \mapsto \mathcal{F}(f\alpha:Y \rightarrow X \rightarrow \mathscr{M})$ to the sheaf $(\alpha:Y\rightarrow X) \mapsto \mathcal{F}(g\alpha:Y \rightarrow X \rightarrow \mathscr{M})$. But the only structure in place to give me such a thing is a morphism in $Stacks/\mathscr{M}$ between $f\alpha$ and $g\alpha$, and I don't see how to construct this. Second, a 2-morphism between 1-morphisms $f,g\in Hom_{Stacks}(\mathscr{M},\mbox{Sh})$ is a section $s:\mathscr{M} \rightarrow \mathscr{M} \times_{\mbox{Sh}} \mathscr{M}$. Thus for any $(\alpha:X\rightarrow \mathscr{M})\in \mathscr{M}(X)$, we get an object $(\alpha,\beta:X \rightarrow \mathscr{M},\varphi:f\alpha \stackrel{\sim}{\rightarrow} g\alpha)\in (\mathscr{M}\times_{\mbox{Sh}}\mathscr{M})(X)$. On the other hand, a 1-morphism $\mathscr{M} \rightarrow \mbox{Sh-map}$ is for each $\alpha:X \rightarrow \mathscr{M}$ an arbitrary morphism on sheaves on $\mathcal{C}/X$. These can't be the same. By the way, I've tried to do (what I think is) the right thing and work out the sheaf in $Shv(\mbox{Sh})$ associated to the 1-morphism $\mbox{Id}:\mbox{Sh} \rightarrow \mbox{Sh}$, following Yoneda and all. From the above, it's easy to see what this sheaf should do to morphisms $X\rightarrow \mbox{Sh}$ from a representable stack. But it appears that I need to make choices if I want to say what it does to arbitrary morphisms of stacks $\mathscr{N} \rightarrow \mbox{Sh}$. Perhaps instead I should take a limit or colimit over its application to the full subcategory of representable stacks over $\mathscr{N}$? 

(Here A is the Steenrod algebra.) I have it on good authority (p. 23) that this is true, but I can't quite make sense of it. The crux of the matter is something I've been wondering for a while: 

I'm reading J.P. May's Concise Course in Algebraic Topology, and I'm having a lot of trouble visualizing how things work in Chapter 8, "Based cofiber and fiber sequences". Of course this is pretty basic stuff, but it's really cool to me that there are such clear topological analogues to the usual exact sequences in homological algebra. Still, I can't even get a clear picture of what a smash product looks like for any but the most basic of spaces, and based cones/suspensions/loopspaces make my head hurt. a) Will I be alright if in my head I just sort think of a smash product as a usual product (for example), with the understanding that I need to tack on an extra condition that I really shouldn't think too hard about? b) Why all the fuss about based homotopy theory, anyways? c) While I'm at it, can anyone suggest a book that is less terse? I feel like this one rarely gives the motivation and visual intuition that I'd like... 

I recently heard the following puzzle: There are three nails in the wall, and you want to hang a picture by wrapping a wire attached to the picture around the nails so that if any one nail is removed the picture still stays but if any two nails are removed then the picture falls down. An answer, schematically, is given by abca-1b-1c-1 (i.e., wrap it clockwise around each of the three nails in some order, then counterclockwise around each of the three nails in the same order). This reminded me very much of the Borromean rings, where three rings are linked but when any one ring is removed the other two become unlinked. So I was trying to figure out if there might be some way to transform one situation into the other. My first instinct was to put the rings in S3 and have one of them pass through ∞, but that isn't really right. What seems to be tripping me up is that with the picture there's an extra object (the wire) that doesn't show up with the Borromean rings, but I have a vague idea that perhaps we could change the former situation by saying that we make the loop in the complement of three unlinked rings, and then perhaps "pulling really hard on the wire" would somehow thread the rings together. Maybe my issue is that what's really going on with the picture is just that we're making a loop in the complement of three points in plane, and I'm confounding phenomena of different dimensions... Does anyone have any ideas? 

There might be something tied up in the qualification that we're talking about algebraic categories, which are defined here. I've never heard of these before. Presumably their properties show up in GrVecSpaces as manifestations of actual things on the topological side, which makes it seem like we're only restricting ourselves to categories that are going to preserve some information that we obviously (?) want to preserve, but probably there's more to it than that. And in any case I don't understand why those should be exactly the properties of GrVecSpaces that we care about. (I'd love to hear about category theory stuff of course, but my main goal is to understand the boxed question.) 

Lubin and Tate show in their paper Formal moduli for one-parameter formal Lie groups that for any formal group over a field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$ with height $h<\infty$, the functor of deformations is represented by a formal scheme isomorphic to $\mbox{Spf } \mathbb{W}(k)[[u_1,\ldots,u_{h-1}]]$. Modulo lower terms, $u_i$ is the coefficient of $x^{p^i}$ in the $p$-series of the universal deformation. (We take $p=u_0$.) Does this carry over for the additive group? Certainly there is an evident deformation to $\mbox{Spf } \mathbb{W}(k)[[u_1,u_2,\ldots]]$. In the paper, the finite height assumption is present in various results that they cite from elsewhere, so without being intimately familiar with the whole theory it's kind of hard to tell if this assumption is essential. 

I would recommend Silverman & Tate's "Rational Points on Elliptic Curves", I'm pretty sure you'll find what you're looking for there. 

Define the lens space L(m,n) as the quotient of S2m+1 by the action of the cyclic group ℤn⊂S1⊂ℂ*. We can create the infinite lens space L(∞,n) by a telescoping construction on the lens spaces L(m,n) for fixed n, which has as an n-sheeted covering space S∞. The homotopy exact sequence is then ... --> π1(S∞) --> π1(L(∞,n)) --> π0(n points) --> π0(S∞) --> ... Here, π1(S∞) is the trivial group, and π0(S∞) is a set with one point. The sequence is still exact at the π0 portion, once we specify a basepoint for each set and call its preimage the kernel of the map, meaning that whatever π1(L(∞,n)) is, it definitely has n elements. It's a group, too, so if n is prime then we have no choice but to conclude that π1(L(∞,n))=ℤn. Of course, even when n isn't prime, the fact of the matter is that this statement is still true. But this is a little unsettling to me. It seems like we're only concluding that because the deck group of the universal cover happens to be ℤn (or, admitting the full extent of our complicity, because we're very nearly taking as a definition that L(∞,n)=S∞/ℤn). If we aren't working with the universal cover, then π1 of the cover isn't trivial, so even if the cover is connected it seems like we could run into the extension problem in trying to compute π1 of the base. Of course, this is all algebraic; perhaps there's something geometric that will save the day and tell us how to interpret this. Is that the case, or is there some other way to unambiguously determine π1 of the base here (perhaps from the definition of the connecting homomorphism via the covering homotopy property)? 

Of course, I'd also be happy if someone suggested an alternative way to prove this weak equivalence. In general, I don't think we should expect "spheres in $X'$" to be detectable by the fibers of the opfibration alone; a toy example illustrating this is the torus fibering over the circle by projection onto one coordinate. But then there's item 4: I'd really like it to be true that somehow the weak contractibility of $N(C)$ forces it to be the case that any map $K \to X'$ factors up to homotopy through the inclusion of some fiber $N(F(c)) \hookrightarrow X'$ (which would solve the problem). But this intuition is coming from the undirected case (i.e. the homotopy theory of spaces, not of categories), which means at the very least that it should be taken with a grain of salt. And unfortunately, $C$ isn't filtered (otherwise this would be easy), and so I don't think I have much control over "why" spheres in $N(C)$ are always nullhomotopic. 

Recently I've been reading J.P. May's A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology. In the section on the classification of covering groupoids, he mentions that sometimes a group G may have two conjugate subgroups H and H' such that H is properly contained in H' (on pp. 26-27, according to his numbering). This seems bizarre to me, and I'm pretty sure I've seen an example before, but I'm having trouble coming up with one now. Anyways, he continues by saying that it is possible to have an endomorphism of a covering groupoid which is not an isomorphism. I'd like to come up with an example of this, and I'm pretty sure that for me obstruction lies in failing to completely grasp the group-theoretic statement above. (Of course, when I think of a covering of groupoids I'm secretly thinking about a covering space, partly because this is his motivation for introducing groupoids and partly because it's just easier for me, so ideally but not necessarily the example would really just be a map of covering spaces over the same base space.)
