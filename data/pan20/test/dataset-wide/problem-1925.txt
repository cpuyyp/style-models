In the United States the rule of thumb is that salary pay rate that the employee sees only represents about half of the rate the employer has to charge a customer for their time. For example the employee sees that their hourly rate is $20 per hour. The see that they earn $20*40*52 or $41,600 per year. But they get 10 days of holidays, and two weeks for vacation, and a few more days for sick leave. Those hours their boss gets zero work, but they still get money in their paycheck. Then there are: 

We have many questions on this site regarding counter-offers when a employee tells management they are leaving. Employees want to know should I take the counter-offer. The general advice is that many times the terms of counter offer is either never fully met (that promised training never happens), or is just a delay. And the delay can be from other side: management uses the increase in pay to buy time to find a replacement, then terminates the current employee or forces them out; employees decide that the better offer hasn't solved the real problem and they start looking again. We have some questions from people who want to use a real or fake job offer to get a better pay or benefits from their current employer. You could be playing a dangerous game by attempting to game the system. They may decide that they don't want to make a counter offer, and now you have no job. They could decide that you have signaled that you are a short-timer and will now treat you as such. why does management make these types of counter offers? Some companies do this routinely, others never make a counter-offer. It depends on what their goals are regarding turnover and their ability to find replacements. It will also depend on their experience when they make these counter-offers. employees might be better off asking management what they need to do to get these better positions/benefits? That way they can decide what they need to do to get those positions. In your situation if it bothers you that others get these benefits, you may be starting on the road to leaving the company. You might not be ready yet, but you could be soon. You may think that threatening to leave is the way to a better situation, but you may find out that those benefits don't solve the problem. 

Yes prepare the letters of reference and make sure the contact information for them is good. HR won't even look at them until they get past a certain point in the process. Unless the letter of recommendation is from an awesome reference it is not even necessary to mention that you have them in either the resume or the cover letter. HR assumes you have some, and that they put you in the best light possible. If your work history is short, then the academic transcript might be required to prove that you have that degree. The unofficial one might be the only one you need. If they want an official one it will have to be generated by the university and sent to the employer. That will also mean that if they want to see it, it will be later in the process. References can can be both from work and college professors. For a BS degree there might not be very many professors that will remember you due to some class sizes being in the hundreds. For the MS and PHD programs pick one or two that remember you, and you did well in their class or with their project. You earned the BS and the MS so why worry about the PHD problems. That doesn't invalidate the earlier work unless the reason was because of cheating or some other fire-able offense. 

This is a follow up to Is it necessary to focus immediately when entering tech industry, and if so how? I've just graduated and a lot of people ask me what area I'm into. I do not know the answer to this question. Right now I'm into IT and development but often times they want me to be more specific. I just went to a couple networking events and everyone said "back end or front end" when I said I'm into development. In school we had to do everything for yourself, so that is back end and front end. I had a co-op where I wrote a program for scientists and it parsed an XML input file, so would this be front end? Is there a clear distinction between back end and front end? Also some people think developers are in the IT department; I always thought they were separate? I know different people use words differently and different companies have different structures, but in networking events and interviews it wasn't a good response "what do you consider a front end developer?" when they asked which area of development I'm into. 

I have been working with an external recruitment agency (they don't represent one company in particular). The other day a recruiter contacted me with a job opening they needed to fill quickly. He asked how much I make at my current job and I'm pretty sure he just added a small amount to it and say that's what the new company pays. I kind of thought the recruiter was "on my side" but I guess it's in their interest to find the lowest cost candidates to fill a position for a company? Should current pay or salary expectations be given to recruiters at all? I normally wouldn't give it to an internal recruiter of a particular company but I guess external is the same. In my area it seems the use of external recruitment agencies is very popular. On one hand they act like they are there to help you get a job, on the other hand they are assessing your skills to see if you would fit the position. I find it hard to tell whether to let recruiters know about my weaknesses so they can help prepare me for the interview, or if I should treat speaking to them like an interview itself and only highlight my strengths. 

A lot of jobs I have been applying to have a section in the form specifically for a link to your Github account. I think this is a good idea, do some coding, put it on Github, so prospective employers can see. The trouble is, sometimes I find what I'm coding is too small and not meaningful and just looks silly putting on displays. A specific example. One job requires knowledge of Bash scripting. I spent a week practicing bash scripting but can't really think of a good project I can do in Bash. I then realized Bash scripting isn't really intended for large projects. Should I put something small on Github anyways, as proof I know it, or would it look silly? Am I going about using Github for employment purposes, the wrong way? EDIT: none of the answers so far address the question, which is "should you showcase even small scripts, if the job posting mentions the language?". This job posting listed bash as a "nice to have", not "required" and I had used it in the passed though never put any to Github. I guess I didn't add this in the first place as I thought it was obvious the primary focus of a job wouldn't be bash scripting. 

Okay, that sounds a bit harsh. So let me add the advice to always lock your screen when leaving your desk - after all your PC has access to lots of 'protected' info as well. I'm sure your supervisor will notice and appreciate it. This will erase any negative impression, if any at all, your first day will have left. 

Clearly it is an important rule in this company, as you are reminded of it twice on your first day. Learn from it and don't let it happen again. 

There is one point the other answers don't really touch yet: for most jobs one doesn't just need to have knowledge of software engineering, but also Domain Knowledge. E.g. someone working on software for a chemical plant should have some knowledge of chemistry and chemical engineering: The requirements and thus the source code will be full of words from those domains. Of course, everyone prefers to hire the perfect candidate that has knowledge of both software engineering and the required domain. In practice, the real world is less than ideal (for employers). So employers have to settle for the best available candidate. The hiring manager might judge that it's easier to train a good chemical engineer with some programming experience in the finer point of software engineering than it is to train a software engineer in the finer points of chemistry. 

One should always follow the local customs, as a matter of courtesy. Ignoring the etiquette is always frowned upon, but could be excused if one doesn't know the etiquette. It is never polite to purposely ignore etiquette. In Europe and the USA, it's the etiquette to shake the hand of the people you meet, regardless of their gender. When two leaders of countries from those parts of the world meet, they always shake hands. Personally, I have shaken the hand of everyone I'm introduced to during work. If a new coworker is introduced while I'm sitting behind my computer, I get out of my chair and shake his or her hand. Not only I do so, but everyone here (The Netherlands) does so. I haven't encountered anyone who refused to shake my hand once I initiated a handshake. It is also an informal rule not to tell others what you believe, and be cautious on political standpoints as well. This avoids pointless and heated discussions, which makes it easier to concentrate on the business. Violating this informal rule by stating your religion during an introduction will be frowned upon. In all places I've worked, it is simple not possible to politely decline a handshake. From what I've gathered, my experience holds in most of the USA and Europe. I know many people don't like that answer, but it's the way it works in the real world. So basically, the only solution left to you, is to ask your religious leaders for an exception from the rule.
