In general, space in the Universe is expanding. However, this expansion can be locally retarded by high enough densities of mass-energy. On very large scales, the mean density is low enough that you can treat the whole universe as expanding. But if you look on smaller scales, you can find underdense regions (voids) where the expansion is actually faster than average, and overdense regions where the expansion is slower or has even ceased. Inside of clusters and galaxy groups (and of course inside galaxies themselves), the density is high enough that space is no longer expanding, and so it's perfectly possible for galaxies to move through local space towards each other and collide. So in your raisin-loaf model, the trick is that regions right around each raisin -- and in local regions containing several raisins close to each other -- aren't expanding. Note that j-g-faustus' argument is somewhat incorrect: if expansion only occurs in voids between superclusters, then Edwin Hubble would never have found it by looking at galaxies within the nearest 30 million light years. Space inside individual clusters and groups is not expanding, but space within superclusters is (just not as fast as space within voids). 

The apparently uniform style you refer to is probably a historical combination of IDL and SuperMongo. Matplotlib (and other Python packages that act as wrappers around it) is on a trajectory to displace the others; I strongly suspect it is already much more common than SuperMongo, and may be roughly as common as IDL by now. You will sometimes see figures produced by the PLplot library as output from programs written in Fortran, C/C++, etc. Plots produced using R are also starting to appear. 

If the question is "if I throw two planets to orbit a star at random direction, would they form an orbital resonance?" -- then in general, no. A resonance is an integral ratio (1/1, 2/1, 3/5, etc.) between the periods of motion of objects -- i.e., the ratio of their periods forms a rational number. Formally speaking the odds of getting a integral ratio (let alone a strong, low-order ratio, since those are the dynamically interesting ones) if you set the system up "randomly" should be infinitesimal, because irrational numbers are (infinitely) more abundant that rationals. However, if the orbits of one or both of the planets can change over time, then the ratio between their periods changes, and they can end up in a resonance. (Which is maybe answering the title question.) How often this happens depends on whether the planets happen to start near a strong resonance, and on how rapidly the orbits change. (If the orbit of a planet changes slowly, then it won't encounter new resonances very often; on the other hand, rapid orbital change can overwhelm the effect of weak resonances, so that the planet passes through the resonance without being caught.) For example, it's thought that Neptune and Pluto were originally not in resonance; but the gradual outward migrations of Neptune (due to various gravitational encounters between planetesimals and the giant planets) changed its orbital period and meant that eventually it reached 2/3 resonance with Pluto, and Pluto was "captured" by the resonance, after which it stayed in resonance with Neptune. The vast majority of objects in the Solar System are not in resonance with anything else, which is perhaps another way of answering your question. (I.e., in practice it doesn't happen very often.) 

Note the stronger visible pixelation in the WFPC2 images (top two panels), due to the fact that the WF pixels are larger in angular size. I suspect any other apparent differences in the press-release images are probably due to the processing used to create the color image. In particular, the side-by-side (WFPC2 vs WFC3/UVIS = "before and after") color image from the press release shows both images at the same spatial scale, as part of a single image file, which means that the same pixel density is present throughout the combined image. But since each original WF pixel is about 2.5 times the (angular) size of a WFC3 pixel, the WFPC2 image had to be rebinned to match WFC3 pixel scale (1 WF pixel = 6.25 WFC3 pixels) before the combined (JPEG/PNG/TIFF) color image could be made. The interpolation used for this rebinning process may be what introduced the extra smoothing in the WFPC2 image. [Edited to add comment about rebinning used to generate color press-release image.] 

You also want stable air with good "seeing", which rules out places with turbulent air and lots of wind (and is another reason mountaintops are good: they're usually above the most turbulent layers of the atmosphere). Quoting from this page (which has a good discussion of the general topic): 

This page -- $URL$ -- suggests that it's very unlikely to find cometary-origin meteorites, even though the majority of observed meteors are cometary in origin, because the latter are too fragile to survive all the way to the ground: 

Yes, they do. Bars in massive galaxies undergo a vertical "buckling" phase about one or two billion years after they form; when this settles down (after about a billion years), the result is that the inner 1/3-2/3 of the bar is vertically thick, with the outer part of the bar still as flat as the rest of the galaxy disk. When seen side-on, the thick part of the bar looks like a peanut (double-lobed), often with a hint of an X-shape; when seen at an intermediate angle, it looks more rectangular and "boxy". This is the situation for the Milky Way, in fact. (When seen with the bar end-on, the result looks very round, like a stereotypical spherical bulge.) You can also see this when the galaxy isn't perfectly edge-on: some bars in galaxies inclined at 45 or 60 degrees (where 90 degrees = edge-on) have rectangular interiors with thinner, offset outer regions; this corresponds to the vertically thick/peanut-shaped inner part of the bar and the vertically thin outer part. We've even seen the signature in a couple of galaxies of a bar in the middle of forming the peanut-shaped bulge (the "buckling phase"). (In principle, you could get a boxy bulge from some kinds of minor mergers, where a small galaxy has merged with a larger galaxy. But if these exist in real galaxies, they're much rarer than the boxy bulges that are part of bars.) 

An astronomical CCD is in principle sensitive across its entire active surface; there are no physical gaps between pixels. The pixels themselves are controlled and maintained by the underlying electronic circuitry, which sets up potential barriers between individual pixels. In practice, there are variations in the actual sensitivity within individual pixels: sensitivity is highest in the center and falls off towards the edges, although it never goes to zero anywhere within the pixel. This paper (PDF) is a recent analysis of a (frontside-illuminated) CCD; Figure 13 shows the measured pixel response functions (how sensitive an individual pixel is across its surface), and Figures 14 and 15 show the photometric sensitivity map (what the sensitivity is for uniform illumination). In the latter case, you can see that the sensitivity never varies more than about 20% or so, depending on the wavelength of the light. Some of the variation corresponds directly to wiring within the CCD absorbing some of the light, but this has a very minor effect on the sensitivity. The comparison made in Florin Andrei's answer to a consumer-camera-style CMOS sensor, as shown in the image, is misleading, both because CMOS pixels are physically somewhat more discrete in ways that CCD pixels are not, and because astronomical CCDs do not have per-pixel filters glued on top of them. (The argument that "there has to be a narrow slice of silicon in between pixels to prevent short-circuits" is not correct for CCDs; the electrical separation between pixels is maintained by the underlying electronics, not by any material barrier. In fact, you have to be able to create temporary "short-circuits" between adjacent pixels in a column in order to transfer the accumulated electrons during readout. That's what the "charger-transfer" in "charger-transfer device" means.)
