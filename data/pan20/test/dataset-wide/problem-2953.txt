What would happen is conceptually very simple. The paper proving "¬1+1=2" will be retitled "Zermelo–Fraenkel Set Theory is inconsistent" and published. From there, it gets harder. Depending on how the proof works, we should end up with a new, weaker set theorem resulting in consistency being restored. Or something worse; the Peano Axioms could be invalid with the consequence of, well, I frankly don't know. Some operation we're used to having goes away, but it won't be addition. Integer addition can't be disproved in the finite realm (thanks science!) so something else on the path to the counterproof is thrown out. Maybe the handling of infinity is wrong in all math. Maybe something else. I'm sorry if this sounds like speculation. The speculation is in fact in the question. It kinda depends on how big of a hole you want to punch. On the practical side, we already know what happens. 1+1=2 will still be true for any reasonable domain and use case so we will continue to use it. After awhile, the failure mode will be understood and carefully (or not so carefully) excluded like we do in Computer Science for overflow now. 

I ate one potato chip from the bag. I ate another potato chip from the bag. There are still more potato chips in the bag. Therefore there are INFINITE POTATO CHIPS! 

There's a bunch of leaps and logical fallacies in the original post, but I think this is the big one. 

I'd encourage you to watch these Numberphile videos where various charismatic mathematicians talk about infinity. They're delightful and will provide you with all sorts of insight into how important and practical infinity is. Also how bad most people's understand of infinity is. In particular... 

Another way to look at it, your argument is circular. Your inductive proof that there is an infinite set of cities assumes there is an infinite set of cities to draw from. 

The post presumes that infinity is some abstract concept that is a result of mathematicians faffing about. That it doesn't have any application to the real world. That's not true. In fact, without infinity math does not work. 

If Zeno seemed to prove our perceptions cannot be trusted, how, then, can/does an Empiricist justify faith in their perceptions? I'm looking for various solutions (or justifications in the face of the paradoxes to maintain Empiricism) of these issues. 

How do current (and traditional) materialists address the problems Kant provided with the separation of noumena and phenomena? It would seem a materialist wishes the phenomena to disappear and leave us with a solid, apodictic understanding of the noumena, for which Kant gives fair arguments against. How would a materialist argue this point, if at all? (If I am misunderstanding the common approach to materialism please provide reference to this as well) 

These last two quotes directly address the questionable nature of our judgment upon our fellow species, I believe. 

In the end, I would say if happiness and instinct are inter-related to agreeableness and therefore, by extension, emotion, then we cannot make judgments of beauty on fellow human beings, because of our base, animalistic instincts, or, as the introduction puts it, although not in addressing it from that perspective, we're "another being acting through nature". 

Your induction draws from a set of city names. However, you have failed to show a proof that there is an infinite number of city names (and that all those cities exist). This is like saying... 

Let's put these two together. The first seems assert that every concept which cannot be physically represented is false. The second builds on that by saying if you don't actually count to infinity, infinity is false. Ok, let's imagine a world without infinity. That means there has to be a biggest number. What's the biggest number? Here, I'll pick one. 1,000,000,000,000. There. I have just asserted the biggest number. What happens if I add one to it? 1,000,000,000,001. A new biggest number! Do it again: 1,000,000,000,002. A new biggest number! Do it again: 1,000,000,000,003. A new biggest number! Do it again: 1,000,000,000,004. A new biggest number! For any biggest number you can imagine, you can add one to it to get a bigger number. I don't actually need to keep at this task, it's enough to prove the potential of their existence were you to keep at the task. Same as I can add 10 + 20 without actually moving little groups of objects around. This is the great utility of mathematics, I don't need to move physical things around to do math. Concepts which don't have a physical form are not false, they just don't have physical form. If I have an idea to build a house slightly different from all other houses it's not a false concept on a house. We know houses work. This particular house just doesn't have physical form yet. But wait! It gets worse! (Or better depending on how you look at it) 

Capitalism is a natural progression (and possibly evolution) from the feudal system of Guild-master/apprentice to factory based, unskilled laborers which require no specific status or knowledge to operate and complete tasks. This evolution moves the slaver from Guild-master to, now called, owner, or what he calls, bourgeoisie (which is directly associated with the capitalist business owner). This is a mere structure change, but now there isn't a necessity to have ownership or castes. He hypothesised that a rise and revolt of the slave working class (slave to the "wage"), or proletariat, against the bourgeoisie due to the realization that they lacked purpose within society (due to the fact that all labors were being conducted by the proletariat, or working-man). 

Berkeley is often sited as the "ideal" of idealism. Most of the academic arguments attack his various points, but his finer points seems to escape the academic community. Kant gives some effort in being fair to Berkeley's idealism in his arguments. 

Sure you can! Infinitely! What happens when you mix red and green? Yellow! What if you mix yellow and red? And the result of that mixing with red again? And that with red again? And again? And again? And again? Each will be a slightly different color. This is similar to what you get when you try to find the smallest fraction. What's halfway between 1 and 2? 1.5. Between 1 and 1.5? 1.25. Between 1 and 1.25? 1.125. And so on. The difference is paint is made up of discrete molecules and eventually you'll have nothing but red left. Numbers don't have an end and you can just keep on dividing. Not only is there an infinity of numbers, there are infinities between every number! The infinite set of positive integers is countably infinite meaning you can potentially count them without leaving any gaps. The infinity between the real numbers is uncountably infinite meaning you can never list them all out (I realize this is not the formal definition). Every time you try to count them you create more gaps to fill in. This is the infinity of the very small. 

Are there other philosophers that have a similar take as that of Mill on the nature of speech (Freedom of speech that does not cause violence or violation/transgression of 'my' rights)? 

In CPJ, Kant seems to imply that rational gender-necessary-reproductive-species (humans) cannot claim other of the same species humans as beautiful based upon our base desires and inability to escape the a priori nature therein (a few of the quotes have been provided). Is this claim accurate in the depiction of humans, according to Kant? 

In the brief illustration provided by Camus we see a man pushing a stone and accepting his lot. As the stone rolls back down the hill it seems he is able to remove himself from this plight, much like a person applying the personal attributions given by Heidegger's Being and Time. Could Camus be seeing a similar dasein-like essence that Heidegger points out? 

Let us go with the example of a chair: 1) If I remember a chair being somewhere it is a perception through memory. 2) If I imagine a chair somewhere then it is a chair somewhere in imagination (or hallucination, which he does make reference to later). 3) If I see a chair, then I am perceiving a chair. Even without arguing the "reality beyond the perception", the only reality "I" am aware of is the perception. How is this not acceptable in the current academia? The "meat" of his arguments, if taken seriously, are soundly based. I don't know of anyone that takes idealism seriously (if there are any modern writing for or against if please give reference), why?
