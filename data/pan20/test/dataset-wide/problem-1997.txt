Being in the right or wrong job is conditional on what your expectations and objectives are. If you don't have one, then it would be hard to know whether this was true or not. I think it is about finding the right balance between what you WANT and what the company NEEDS from you. If you feel like you are getting what you want to providing what the company needs, then all is well. I think you realize that perhaps luck has more to do with skills in getting into these types of roles, so the important thing is to continue developing your skills (not just technical, but interpersonal as well) and set goals for what you want to achieve with your career and let that guide you rather than your feelings and assumptions. At the end of the day, no one is irreplaceable, and in the end people will leave either because they have had enough or they were proactive enough to want to find something better. I don't know of people who are perfectly happy with their job, but they usually have other motivations to keep them there. 

I guess if his actions (and some of them seem pretty bad) hasn't created the kind of reaction that would draw attention to your boss, then it means that people in the company don't care enough about customer relations. Your case is a good reason why there should be workplace performance reviews, and that people who don't cut it after a probation period should not continue to be hired. Perhaps this is something that needs to be introduced, otherwise you just have to give your boss the hard work and put something in front of him so he can see for himself what the person is doing to the reputation of the business. 

That part of the interview is not there as another manipulation opportunity. As an applicant you should ask question that you're genuinely interested in and need the information. Especially whatever is relevant to make a decision on accepting an offer. But "just curious" is also a fair game. I suggest NOT asking anything just for show. A good interviewer will not build any conclusion of that section, as candidates may be well prepared so not need to ask. Or what is usual, just be mentally exhausted at that point. Os just shy or anything. 

Yes, it is pretty common that growth makes the existing management forms not working well enough, making leaders overwhelmed. And a common response is to get some outsider. And as usually there's little experience on telling good from bad, it's easy to pick up a genuine bad apple with good fast-talking skills. Or one that would be good elsewhere, but not a good fit for that company. I heard stories in all directions, including where the new mid-manager was dropped after a few months and the team restored to good work. Also where he was kept and half the team left or got reorganized. If you really have good standing with the CEO, you may ask yourself out of that pyramid forming a separate branch -- maybe even with some team members. And until the dust settles you can use the 5 WHY method, make the manager explain everything not evident, recursively. That way you might dig out incompetency, or learn that he is right after all. It's quite fail-safe. (And if he just refuses or can't answer, that is sure indication of a douche.) 

A company that has a single point of failure is unfortunately not a good model of business operation. There is only so much a person can do, and the problem with the effort versus reward in companies is that the more effort you put in, the less reward to get (as your effort becomes taken for granted). At the end of the day, if you have raised a resourcing issue that impacts on the deadline and the manager/boss doesn't do anything about it, they only have themselves to blame. There is no real good or bad way to tell him that the deadline is not going to be met, only that you should do it as soon as possible because it will give them more time to work out how to deal with the situation. If you get blamed and fired then be thankful that you don't have to put up with the situation any more. If they end up hiring another person then your immediate problem is solved. Whatever you do, don't procrastinate because it is better to make a decision and spend the time focusing on problems that you can solve. 

In some ways this is almost like a credibility/reliability check on an employee, unless it is relevant to the work that you are doing. I guess it also depends on the type of social media they are referring to, since there are also professional groups or networks online like LinkedIn and StackExchange, even Deviant Art, Behance, Dribbble and others that are specific to particular professions. I would even consider KickStarter or CrowdSpring as social media related information that an employer would find of interest. 

I actually did leave a software development job before having another lined up, and it worked out well. Leaving a position early can be beneficial, but there are some nuances you should take care of first: 

It seems that the owner and other employees are content with the relaxed and slow-paced atmosphere. I don't recommend calling anyone out for not working hard enough. What you see as the employees taking advantage of the owner may simply be that their vision of the company is more comfortable, and less competitive, than you prefer. Rather, use the other employees' shortcomings to impress the owner with your own abilities. If the owner is used to everyone making small amounts of progress between meetings, work to make a lot of progress between meetings, and show off what you've done. In addition to getting credit for your own abilities, you'll likely inspire the others to work harder to avoid looking bad in comparison. If you feel that a tight-knit, slow-pace environment doesn't appeal to you as much as much as a fast-paced environment, you should start looking elsewhere. Be sure to ask questions about the work environment of any prospective employer to be certain that they encourage an environment with a pace and work ethic that are appropriate for you. If you do decide to leave, you should be fine mentioning that you're looking for a faster-paced environment, but don't imply that the company needs to change, and definitely don't point fingers. Your reason for leaving is a matter of your taste, and the others at the company have as much right to prefer their current environment as you have to prefer a more competitive one. 

Can someone provide an example of what the 'reasonable' amount of hours that was asked for, and how the employer justified the application of this clause? 

I think it depends on if the letter of recommendation was offered to you or if you requested it. Generally people are not going to write a bad one (and if they did you wouldn't use it). So I would consider it just another tick in the box, so if you had it and also a good resume then it just gives you another edge. The most important thing is to be able to demonstrate your skills, and if the letter of recommendation doesn't say much then there's not that much use other than the fact that you were not afraid to ask for one and the other party was at least willing to provide one. 

I understand that it is polite to say 'excuse me' after you sneeze, and to say 'bless you' to someone after they sneeze. In situations where someone (possibly) yourself seem to sneeze incessantly, do you need to keep saying 'excuse me' or to say 'bless you' to the other person? I assume that once is usually enough to indicate that you are aware of the etiquette. Is it less polite to say it just once or not to say it at all? 

Many organizations and teams try to organize something for a person's birthday as a sign of showing care and interest in their employees. If there is a particular reason that a person doesn't want their birthday to be celebrated (e.g. it might coincide with a sad event), is there an appropriate way to do so without offending or appearing to be unappreciative of this gesture? 

Don't ask about policy, that is futile. You won't get usable information. However you can construct a few stories with a conflict and can use that. Tell the story and ask what the company would do in the situation. If it sounds good, ask ahead, that what enforces it. Or switch to a variant where you discovered that some decision-maker failed to do that, and ask what can you do in the situation, where to turn, how to resolve, etc. Probably you get a better picture. Though still can hit a gap between theory and practice. 

For the technical side: I discovered that ear-bud type headphone is great for this. It kills noise pretty well even without anything going, and provides pretty good-sounding music. Without leaking to outside. And not really wearing on the head or ears. My only remaining problem is to pull them when I stand up or someone wants to talk... 

You signed the contract, so you're bound indeed. You can consider the difference as price for a good lesson: agents serve their pocket, not yours. And if you want something done well, do it yourself. (At least in the non-professional field. Leave doctoring to doctors, architecting to architects.) And at least do yourself a favor to verify things before signing, you could find the ad if you just looked, right? Certainly every contract can be canceled, renegotiated, etc following up on the original agreement and using the law framework, you can ask raise nicely, or you can call up some ultimatum. Any of those carry risk, obviously. I'd probably wait up the next regular time point of salary raise/renegotiation, if such thing exist. 

I think it really depends on the type of work and organization that you are targeting. With user experience being such a big deal these days, you might find it really easy to get into an online gambling company doing programming for them because you have good user insight/knowledge. It might work against you in organizations that are of a more commercial/corporate nature because they might think you like spending time doing things that are not considered to be in line with their image. Of course, these are all just assumptions, and you can go with either excluding the details or tailor the content so that it addresses the position description and company image better. 

Is this something that people have struggled with in the past? I find that when you look at a card and everyone is writing the same thing, or someone who knows the person well writes something very fitting and personal, it always makes the next person's job that much more difficult. Is there something that you have used in the past that is both simple and not too over the top, especially when you don't know the person very well? 

They will much prefer the 2 page version compared to the 9 page one, and it also shows your ability to summarize and present yourself well. Having said that, if you only have a limited amount of time, and if you still have lots of preparation for the interview then you might just want to do a quick summary for the 9 page interview instead, because it can take a lot of time to compress all that information (remember it is not necessary easier to write less). Think about how much time you have to spare and where you should put your effort into.
