List here why you think you have 'strong leadership'. Have you lead a team? Do you recall a specific instance where there was a difficult situation for you to navigate? How about detailing a project where your leadership led to a positive outcome. If you put it on there, you have to be willing to demonstrate that you you actually have this quality. 

It's really hard to say. They should have sent you some sort of reply. That's pretty common but I suppose they don't have to. They may not be in any hurry to hire someone. They could be fielding a large volume of qualified people. People can react very negatively to being corrected too, you can't control that. There is a possibility that you're overqualified. Recently a group of my classmates all applied for the same software job. We've all taken the same classes together and I've worked with each of them over the years and in my assessment the least qualified one among them got the job. The top two didn't even get an interview. Sometimes these software jobs are companies looking for people who can put code into the computer, without having to pay for a 'developer', I make that statement very cautiously and wish not to sound pretentious. You can keep politely following up but at some point you may have to face the music that you didn't get it and continue to look elsewhere. 

Probably not what you want to hear, but I'm confident in saying this because the same thing happened to me. The fact that you haven't been promoted...could be your fault. I for the longest time assumed that if I worked hard enough that someone would tap me on the shoulder and I would get that magical promotion I always wanted. That's not how business works all the time, for sure mine doesn't. I had to make some noise. Look at it from your company's perspective. Year after year they're getting good work out of you and they can't read your mind. They're not going to just give your more money because they're feeling generous right? I would, sit your new manager down and do some sort of career path charting. Gather some data on the market wage for your responsibilities put together a good summary of your work and go from there. Don't threaten to quit, but signal to them that you're not satisfied with your current situation, that you want to move up and why. Just be honest with your manager. Then it's documented, the next manager you get will have the information too. 

I can't speak for all companies, it is in my company. I suspect most companies that do not specialize in software are this way though. 

I would say not really. If you can speak to the passion about your hobbies, whatever they are, effectively a potential employer will be able to see that you have passion for what you're doing. Writing code, travel, golf, whatever. I think having other hobbies is a positive to being social too. Especially when you have to work with non developer business units. The best gauge of your technical acumen is of course going to be your work. 

I don't think there is anything unethical about asking. You're not trying to steal it or develop on the side without consent. Should he accept, you will need to get a contract of some sort drawn up. There sounds to be a bit of work done with company money to prepare so keep that in mind while negotiating. There may be royalties you would have to pay if you sell it, or he may just give it to you outright. You might be able to throw in licencing for free for his company when you finish it. Though this is conditional and dependent on you finishing. I've had enough 'this is going to be awesome' side projects lose momentum to know to approach a this with some trepidation. Another thing you could try is to get him to revive the project completely with you as the lead. You've explained that you feel that his idea is very valuable, so much so that you would go it alone. Get a presentation together and explain this. You might have to get a bit out of your comfort zone and explain the accounting side of it. Simply telling your boss that it's a good idea does not help him understand why it's a good idea, especially if he isn't technical. Businesses operate in dollars and cents so you would have to translate why it's a good idea into those terms. It gets increasingly hard the larger the sum. Furthermore with this approach you can use it as platform to explain to your boss that you aren't challenged with your current tasks, this would give you the opportunity to provide more value to his company. 

Colgate makes a waterless/rinsless brush system called the wisp. They're kind of pricey and more of an emergency type of thing, but it may help the situation. To expand a bit on @Stephan Kolassa's bit about gum. They do make a dentist recommended type that contains xylitol. It helps with enamel restoration too. I would do some research on those types of gums before choosing one and make sure you follow the directions. I'm not a dentist or a doctor as a caveat, but my dentist told me to use xylitol gum. 

It could be your manager is struggling with some personal issues. I would keep that in mind and tread lightly. I don't know if you or anyone else that reports to her are having similar issues. Seems like a simple piece of feedback should not have warranted the response. Maybe she was just having a bad day. I've snapped at a coworker before (and been snapped at myself). Though if your work has started to be affected then this may not be the case. I would look to seek help from HR. You could be in a very tough spot I think. You need the (assumed)unbiased 3rd party because this issue has already affected your work as she is not giving you your usual tasks. Today it's normal tasks tomorrow its a bad review. Then it's your word against hers and it may not end well for you. You could also try to clear the air with her if possible. Don't be defensive or confrontational but a followup with some clarification may be what you need. You appreciate that she is looking out for you in some way, making sure you look professional but the frequency was too much. 

I wouldn't bother. Though I would work to broaden your knowledge of internal systems if C++ is going to be the language you're tested on for an internal job posting. It would be one thing if you had some coding error but picking the wrong algorithm to implement is a very big flag to a technical review. Algorithm selection, by and large should not depend on the language (though there are some cases where it could). If you knew what one you were supposed to pick, but implemented poorly from lack of depth in the language, well that's different than picking the wrong one altogether. 

I'm not huge on the labels. I think calling someone a junior or a senior is a good way to falsely categorize the office and weight opinions where they need not be weighted. There can also be some flaring of egos for no good reason. Having said that, there are plenty of places who use the junior/senior tags well but not all of them do. We recently got a 'Senior Project Analyst', the qualifications? 23 years seniority, most of which was spent elsewhere. He hates the label too but this is what the company gave him. Absent from my email signature is the demarcation despite having spent over 5 years in supply chain related software development and going on 9 with the company so far. I recently listened to a hanselminutes podcast, that had a ton of information in it about what you're asking. I would give it a listen. Ideally, the J/S titles should denote levels of experience but as the industry changes, by the day if you're in the Javascript framework land the equation gets a bit hazy. Perhaps the best summary I can think of is a senior has made more mistakes than a junior (and learned from them). If you're fresh out of school doing a ton of work in open source and you get hired as junior under a 'senior' who's spent his career in non open source does the distinction really count when working on an open source project? There's some fundamental overlap sure, but the things I would look to a senior for...nuance and somewhat esoteric about a subject just wouldn't be there would it? I would say look carefully at the qualifications being asked for in the posting. If you can speak and work effectively through them just apply. The company knows what it's looking for and if you don't cut it for them with 0 years or 10 years they'll let you know.
