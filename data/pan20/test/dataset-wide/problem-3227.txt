In popular culture Christians were being killed in the Colosseum because they did not want to accept the Emperor as a god. An example can be Quo vadis novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz, who won the Nobel Prize for this. The Colosseum is Catholic sacred place, however not because it was used to kill Christians, but because many people died there. The Jews for example had never accepted Caesar to be a god and nothing happened. The Greeks had their own Pantheon, very similar, however different. How (in reality) did Roman Empire treat people who did not want to accept Roman gods? Were they killed or punished (eg. with a fine)? Or it was just not important to anyone? In Wikipedia an article (with a "citation needed" remark) states: 

This is not a peace treaty, so I looked for documents mentioned there. The treaty of Zgorzelec (the one between Poland and the DDR) 

Even if using the title "King of France" was only a part of some tradition, this should have been some problem for the French as after the Revolution they demanded to cancel using it. Of course it is clear that France and England (or Great Britain or United Kingdom) not always had good relations, but I understand that France somehow accepted this. Did she beg/ask/demand the English to cease it? I understand that when two kings met on some occasion (or an ambassador was introduced to a king) there was confusing presentation of two "kings of France". How did other countries take/recognise this title (the largest/most important, like Spain, Holy Roman Empire, Austria, Poland/Lithuania, the Pope, Ottoman Empire maybe)? Was it just taken "it's just a children's play, let the English perform it, if it's fun for them"? Has anyone tried to clear this situation? 

During the 16th and 17th centuries, there were many religious wars in Europe. In countries, were it was very close to Rome (like Spain, Portugal, Austria, Italian states), they did not occur. In Northern Europe (Scandinavia), were it was far from Rome, or it head also political reasons (the Netherlands), the Protestantism was accepted (relatively) quickly. However, in the "middle" countries, like German states, France, in some part Bohemia and Hungary, and of course England and Scotland, the Reformation was not quickly accepted/rejected, but some wars or fightings occurred. In Poland (and Lithuania), which is geographically in the same position as Germany, no wars happened. This is somehow strange, as many Polish people were protestant and many Catholic. Sources claim that "Poland was very tolerant", example (WHKMLA): 

Anyone can declare that he or she is running for president of the United States. That is essentially unrelated, however, to whether he or she will be placed on the ballot, much less have a chance of winning. To become president, one must win a majority in the Electoral College, and barring an extraordinary bout of collegiate faithlessness, that means you will need to get electors who support you selected. The selection of electors is largely a matter of state, not federal law, but at the very least, you'll need to qualify for the ballot in every state and the District of Columbia. If you're representing a party, you'll need to be certified as that party's candidate, a process which also depends on state law and party rules. So, determining the longest-running campaign has numerous answers depending on how you define a candidate: Anyone who declares? Anyone who won delegates? Anyone who got ballot access? Anyone nominated by a party with ballot access in XX% of the states? Anyone who received above XX% of the popular vote in a primary or the general? Anyone who won electoral votes? Anyone who had an actual chance of winning? Some possibilities include the following: Major party candidates

Kublai Khan could qualify, but the answer depends somewhat on how narrowly one defines rule. One should remember that neither city was a capital when his rule began. Supreme authority for the Mongol Empire lay in the Great Khan (Khagan), ostensibly elected from the chiefs in council (kurultai). In practice Genghis (Chinggis) Khan divided the empire among his sons and grandsons, with supreme authority to be vested in the khagan. In the west, his grandson Batu led the Golden Horde against the post-Kievan Rus. In 1237-38 he invaded the polity of Vladimir-Suzdal and razed Moscow, then little more than a trading outpost; it would not begin to prosper until late in the century, under Prince Daniel. In the east, the lands of northern China were already securely under Mongol rule. Genghis had razed the former Jurchen Jin capital of Zhongdu, on the site of modern-day Beijing, in 1215. In 1264, Kublai Khan defeated his brother Ariq Böke to become the de facto Great Khan, and moved his court from Karakorum to Zhongdu. Over the next several years, he would redevelop it into his grand capital of Dadu (Khanbalikh), proclaimed in 1271 with the founding of the Yuan Dynasty. As Great Khan, he would thus have claimed power over both Moscow and what is now Beijing. His younger brother Hulagu, who ruled as Il-Khan (subordinate khan) in Southwest Asia, and Batu's son and successor in the Golden Horde, Berke, did not challenge his claim as Great Khan. But neither did they attend the kurultai Kublai Khan called to legitimize his rule. For his part, Kublai was preoccupied with matters in China, both in administration and in invasions of Vietnam and Japan. By his death in 1294, the Golden Horde, Il-Khanate, and Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia more or less functioned independently of the Yuan emperor, and would not be subject to the Great Khan until the reign of Tamerlane. 

Now going back to the main subject. The last Austrian-Hungarian emperor Charles I wanted to sign peace: 

In Poland, where I live, there are also many streets that are named after fictional characters. Usually, this practice dates for about 30 years. The Winnie-the-Pooh St. in Warsaw (Ulica Kubusia Puchatka) dates 1950s. I can't find the source now, but I read that it was the first street in Poland to be named after a fictional character. There are now lots streets in Warsaw, in new districts, that are named after non existing or legendary persons. For example, in this region there are some streets after Henryk Sienkiewicz's characters: Jana Skrzetuskiego, Kmicica and Michała Wołodyjowskiego. Wernyhora is also not certainly authentic person. However, I've never found a street that was named after fictional eg. region, river etc. UPDATE There is a famous, semi-grotesque tv series, dated in 1980s., in fact anti-communist, but made with trick, so censorship allowed it, which is called "Alternatywy 4". This is some kind of wordplay, because the action takes place in residential building placed on the Alternative Street in Warsaw, building number 4. The address was fictional, but in 2006 the real building with the address Alternatywy 4 was erected in Warsaw (Google Maps). The building is modern-style, and does not however look similar in any way to the "original" one from the TV series. Probably some bars or cafes are named after places from fiction, where they were to exist, but I don't know any example of such practice for streets (but it does not mean there aren't any). 

In Poland it is always said that it is a White Eagle. This is mentioned in current Constitution (translated by me): 

Just to mention, as he was not from "great powers", the Pope Benedict XV made several attempts to make both sides sign peace. 

I don't know what the truth is but for me it seems that also Mr. Rosa does not states decisively that he was Polish -- this "fits him most".

I will provide a bit more detail on three factors: 1. Unpreparedness The British and French governments held Hitler to be a bully, willing to instigate border skirmishes and bark rhetoric, but not start a full-scale war over Poland. In fact, Lord Halifax, the British Foreign Minister, believed that Hitler was about to back down; on August 31, hours before the outbreak of war, he said he had seen in Hitler “the first view of the beaten fox.” So much for that. Both Britain and France had been re-arming in anticipation of future conflict, and the French had begun to mobilize their army as early as August 26, but the process was incomplete. French commanders reported that they would not have sufficient resources to mount an offensive until 1941–42, and even if that was an exaggeration, other papers have argued that early in the war, the British and French believed time was on their side because it would give them time to coordinate and mobilize the full strengths of their overseas empires. The calculation was not to defend Poland in the short term, but to defeat Germany in the long term. The British forces were inadequate for mounting a full-scale offensive. The air force was concerned about bombing, because it lacked the means to stop retaliatory raids; the navy could not operate freely in the Baltic Sea; the British Expeditionary Force was quite small compared to the French army. And even the last would take took several weeks to cross the Channel, by which time Poland was already doomed. Still, Germany had deployed most of its forces in the east, and at the Nuremburg trials, their generals testified that had France and Britain taken action early in September, the course of the war would have changed and Germany might well have been defeated. 2. Misunderstanding of modern warfare According to William Shirer's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, France was bound under treaty with Poland to attack Germany within three days of the order to mobilize, and to launch a major offensive within fifteen. Gen. Gamelin was not a timid general, but he believed that any attack required an artillery barrage, and made his offensive and defensive plans according. The French army waited in the field while fixed artillery could be brought out from storage, shipped to the front, and assembled, and wanted for planes and tanks. A direct attack on Germany in the north was not possible without violating the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands; in the south, the French army did invade the Saarland on September 7 to fulfill France's treaty obligation, but did not advance far into Germany, stopping short of the Siegfried Line fortifications. And shortly thereafter, the Supreme War Council decided not to proceed with invasion, and ordered the army to retreat back behind the Maginot Line. 3. Fear of wider war and hope for a peaceful settlement And why would the Supreme War Council do that? The horror of World War I was very much in the minds of European leaders. Fear and wishful thinking led them to hold out for what now seems like a foolish amount of time. At the outbreak of war, Germany was allied with the Soviet Union, something that became clear when Soviet forces joined the invasion two weeks later. Chamberlain and Daladier did not want to risk angering Stalin and widening the war. They might have been able to send forces to reinforce Poland from the Mediterranean, but were not yet at war with Italy, and did not want to risk provoking Mussolini. At the same time, Hitler was intimating with diplomats that Poland would at last appease him. On September 19 he declared in a speech that he had no war aims against Britain or France, and on the 28th Germany and the Soviet Union issued a statement that the matter of Poland having been "settled" (through their conquest and partition), there was no further cause for war. And the British were in contact with disaffected Germany military officers, hoping they would influence or overthrow Hitler. It did not come to pass. 

Well, this is not a good source, but you might want to read "Fall of Gigants" by Ken Follett, a novel based on sources, which refers to the subject you are interesting in. By logic, this (feminization of industry) could never drop to rate as of 1914. The main reason was than many men died or was much injured. Not only because of lack of male workers, but also lack of male heads-of-families. I can't find any numbers, but if I do, I'll update the answer. 

Why did Wilhelm I (or Bismarck) decide to perform official Germany unification in France? In my opinion, if the ceremonial was to honour the Prussian king and be a tribute or allegiance to him, it should be held in Berlin/Potsdam (like cardinals honour new pope in Rome). Of course, capturing Paris in 1870 war was a spectacular event showing the Prussian dominance, however (as it seems) the French capital was not considered to be kept by the Prussians (or Germans) forever. I performed some research, however I couldn't find any detailed information, nor any trustworthy sources. 

In Polish there are two words which can be translated to the same English "real socialism". The first, most commonly known, is "socrealizm", which in fact is "socialist realism", a trend in art (whatever "art" means). The second (the one you ask about) is "socjalizm realny". The Polish Wikipedia says the term was introduced in the USSR in 1970s. by propaganda. This 1970s. seems to be good beginning. The "real socialism" was created in the moment when it was clear that communism is no longer acceptable. First of all, consider the communist eras (since the end of WW2, as they are common in all Soviet Bloc): 

Time up to fall of the Roman Empire is called Ancient. The following 1000 years is "Medieval". Since Napoleonic times we can say it is "modern history". Is there a common name for the time between fall of Constantinople and French Revolution? The problem for me is that I don't want to say eg. "times of Renaissance, Baroque, Classicism" etc., but I'd like to use one single name. For example New World history could be divided in three main periods: "age of discovery", "colonialism" and "imperialism". I'm looking for something such general as "colonialism" but in relation to Europe.
