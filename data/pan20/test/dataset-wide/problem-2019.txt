I am going to be blunt here because it is important you learn this lesson well. Stop whining. Your colleague is now the boss. Of course, he will demonstrate his authority, as is his right (and to an extent, obligation) as the boss. Of course, he will try to change the old way of doing things. Maybe he did not like the way things were done before, but did not have the authority to change it then. Now he has the authority. If the boss' instructions are unclear, just ask for clarification. It is also not a great idea to call the boss as "plainly wrong". If the boss has made a mistake, explain your reasoning to him politely and help him fix it. It is also possible that ... surprise ... the boss was right and you were wrong. The fact that you both joined the company together, but he advanced to be the boss hurts you, I understand that. But that is of no relevance here. He is the boss now and you should treat him like one. The fact that you do not understand so many things as noted above and he does is probably a good indication of why he got promoted and you didn't. 

You found out your manager is trying to get you fired, so the only thing you should do is start looking for another job. The source of information being her private Facebook messages is irrelevant to what you do. From your perspective, the situation would be the same if you had found out through other means, such as eavesdropping on her phone call, or due to her wrongly forwarding you an email, etc. Your gut instinct is correct, nothing good will come out of going to HR. Making decisions to fire people is more or less a part of a manager's job, so complaining to HR that you found out your manager is doing her job (by unauthorized access to her private Facebook messages, no less) will not only make you look silly, but also give them evidence to support their decision. 

Just call your boss and ask. Don't assume the worst without solid evidence. For all you know, your boss may have been on vacation and hasn't read your mail. If you do not have the boss' number, you could contact the company's reception. They should (hopefully) connect you to the boss. If not and you haven't burned bridges, you can set up an appointment to visit the company to discuss the issue. Absolutely do not take legal route without hearing what the other party has to say. If it turns out that your paycheck was delayed due to some genuine reason, you will not only feel embarrassed but also burn bridges. 

As a result, I will have to convert bitcoins into my "home" currency anyway. Getting paid in "alternative" currency is thus a nuisance that I would keep out of my life at all costs. 

This sounds a lot more reasonable, and unless the interviewer is a complete jerk, I would expect they would accommodate this request. A couple of other alternatives I would suggest before the interview are: 1. Mock Interviews Get one of your friends to interview you. This person should be someone who is understanding of your problem, and you are comfortable having your panic attacks before them. Do this several times, perhaps with different people. 2. "Entertainment" Interviews A lot of the interview anxiety results from Analysis Paralysis. "What if I don't get this job?" "What if I answer this question wrong?" "What if they laugh at my solution?" I have myself been a "victim" of this, and to overcome this problem, I started attending what I like to call Entertainment Interviews. These are interviews I attend without any kind of expectation as to getting an offer, or in other words, interviews for entertainment. If I get an offer, that's a bonus, but the primary purpose is entertainment. Not worrying about the outcome of the interview means that I can focus entirely on the interview. After some practice, you start seeing the interview questions as some random stranger (such as, an undergrad student on an online forum) asking you a technical question, and then you can answer them much more freely. 

You should spend no more than 1 hour, 48 minutes on the test. On a more serious note, that is a decision entirely for you to make based on how much you value your time and how much getting to the next round of interview matters to you. 

For the issue of returning the company laptop, an easy practical solution that usually works is to just hand it over to your team leader (or senior colleague) who works at the same client location. Of course, you should inform your boss by mail with the team leader in copy, and get the team leader to reply to the email confirming that they have received the laptop. If there are no senior colleagues1 working at the same location or they are unwilling to cooperate, then you will have to follow the laborious "by the book" solution. Below is the order in which you would usually go about it in an Indian IT company. (You have already done some of these.) 

I would say you did the correct thing, by communicating upfront about your delayed joining date. This is an important factor that would influence the hiring decision. Hiding it from them to tilt the odds in your favour would be unprofessional. 

From my experience with the Indian culture1, there is no reason to worry about these wedding invitations from colleagues. You just need to handle the social interactions with some finesse, which is not too hard. I have received over 50 such invitations over the years, and have attended a grand total of ZERO weddings among them. This has had no impact at all on my career or relationships with colleagues. It is customary to give the invitation cards to every team member, but everyone understands this is done mostly out of courtesy. Unless you have a close friendship with the colleague, he2 does not really expect you to attend. If you do attend, however, you will be welcomed all the same. If you attend the wedding, you should give a gift. Not doing this brings a bigger social shame than just people thinking you are financially weak. You will be considered a freeloader, who attended only for the free food. The gift need not be something extravagant but also not too cheap. You should choose something proportional to your rank in the company and/or your social standing (there is usually a strong correlation between the two, but not always). Now, we come to handling the social aspects in the workplace if you don't want to attend. Don't decline the invitation right after the colleague hands you the invitation card because that is rude. Congratulate him, read the card and have some small talk regarding the wedding. For example, "what does the girl do?", "oh, the wedding is in Colombo. Do you go there by flight or train?", etc. You can even say that you may not be able to attend the wedding. As long as you can show you are happy for him, you won't hurt his feelings. No matter how much the invitation annoys you, don't say anything rude, and you will be fine. 

On job sites, I keep the resumes private rather than taking them down entirely. This is only for convenience, since the next time I need to actively seek jobs, I only need to upload updated resumes and update a few fields, not fill up entire forms from scratch. Moreover, many job sites don't allow creating multiple accounts with the same email or phone number (even if the previous account was deleted), another hassle easily avoided by not taking down the account entirely. Most job sites also provide a text field called Summary (or equivalent). I "cheat" to use it to leave a custom message for a potential recruiter (if the job site doesn't allow making the resume private or allows a "premium" recruiter to see private profiles anyway). 

Don't expect your current manager or HR to helpfully remind you of this policy or suggest you to use it. :) Read the company policy yourself. Be aware that the "basic salary" is not your full salary, but only one component of it. Also note that to seek reimbursement from your new employer, you need a written statement from your current employer mentioning the amount of notice period buyout paid by you. If you quit the company without this document in hand, you can pretty much forget about the reimbursement. You should avoid asking about the notice period buyout to your prospective employer in the initial rounds of interview. Discuss this only with the HR, and wait until they bring up the topic of notice period. If you know some other employees in the company on a personal level, you can also try to get this information from them, without jeopardizing your interview. 

Additionally, on a case-by-case basis, you can decide if you need to "fix" further use of the offensive word, and if so, whether the "fix" should be restricted to the ongoing discussion or be permanent. For example, let's say, you didn't know that "Negro" is an offensive word in US. When someone points that out the first time, you would do well to avoid using it "permanently" from then on. If instead, a specific gentleman objects to using "meat" as an example to illustrate some point for some religious reasons, but other people (following the same religion) have no such objections, it is not serious enough to warrant a permanent fix, you could just avoid using it around that gentleman. If people bend backwards to find ways to get fake offended, it is their problem, not yours. 

Don't overthink this. When you are ready with your "optimal" application, just submit a new one. Your application is highly unlikely to be the only junk application they receive with such a confusing UI. Don't draw any more attention to it. 

1 On a personal note, I find it extremely disconcerting when honest people commonly having a genuine issue allows others to get away with pretending that they too have the same issue. 

Don't do this. The "just enough BS" that you give could mislead someone into making a wrong decision, causing potential harm. Your false fear of appearing incompetent is of little importance in the bigger picture. 

Given that mergers and acquisitions are quite common in the industry (and not just in software/IT), any hiring manager qualified enough to read your resume should not be surprised that the "Foo" app doesn't exist any more, if you make it clear enough as above. I also think it is not necessary to explicitly point out the acquisition date, because (1) it is already clear that the Foo app is now known by the new name of Bar (2) it provides no useful information with regards to the decision to shortlist your resume. 

If your manager shares the details of your remuneration request with other managers (as a laughing matter or otherwise), do you think your "honest" feedback would be treated with any more respect? It sounds clear to me that nothing good is likely to come out of your honest feedback. If he remembers to ask you for the feedback again, just offer standard "diplomatic" feedback and be done with. I would also advise not to grow too fond of this role and certainly not to look up to taking his role. This management sounds messed up, you should try to get out of there as early as you can.
