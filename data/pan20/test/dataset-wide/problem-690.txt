spinning fast has to overcome resistance in muscles - if you are not lean fat embedded in muscles causes more resistance you need more fast twitch muscles which you can only develop with training 

As others have mentioned, some spare parts are hard to source. Shimano still makes rear sprockets but they are not the same quality as was available in the past. Some campag cones (a consumer item) are very hard to find. BB and headset are French thread on my bike, again hard to find although specialists like Velo Orange can help for a price. As far as performance, there is not a huge difference. Steel is comfortable. The 80s started to see some nice saddles. Geometry is nice. Performance hit on some of the alpine climbs I do is around 5%. Clipless pedals really are nice. Either ride clipless or in sneakers. Old style leather shoes with cleats are a poor solution. Gearing: hard to get the same range of gears without going for a triple. I changed the front rings for 38x50 and put a 14x28 on the back but it is hard work on steeper climbs. The Eroica has sections of 15% off road. Brakes: are rubbish, along with pedals another biggie. I changed the brake shoes for modern compounds which helped but the system is poor compared to modern calipers. Downtube shifters: honestly I thought this would be the worst thing about riding a retro bike but it really didn't bother me. You maybe change gear less and anticipate more - but you've only got 12 gears to play with anyway. 

There is no limit to safe downhill speed on your bike. The limit is when you come off your bike. In which case even a low speed crash of 20 to 30 mph can be pretty nasty on chip and seal type surfaces or where there are obstacles (oncoming traffic anyone?). You can ride a modern road bike up to 60 mph, even a little more but I would say that it is not safe to ride at that speed with nothing but spandex and a lightweight crash helmet. 

Overall everything is just a bit more fiddly to adjust and get setup right and goes out of adjustment quicker: pedals, pre-cartridge bottom brackets, headsets. Steel is a nice frame material though, better than today's mid range aluminium bikes. I've got another retro race bike which I fitted with fattish tires. It came from a dumpster and I use it to ride our bike thief infested streets. 

Get a frame builder to braze in a new dropout. That dropout is finished and dangerous to use, it has bent too far. 

If you have an elliptical bottom bracket you won't need a tensioner. Ditto for dropouts that allow horizontal movement. If you are very lucky even a vertical dropout frame won't need a tensioner but as chains stretch over time this probably won't hold true for long. When the chain is too short you will have parts of the crank rotation that are very stiff. When the chain is too long it risks coming off and jamming the wheel causing a dangerous skid. In this case a chain tensioner (which could be an old junk derailleur) is a good idea. 

There are other factors in play though. Force may do more damage to soft joint tissue leading to pain or even injury. 

I think the trainer Frederic Grappe (FDJ team) had a good answer. He would rather an uphill and downhill into the wind than a flat into the wind because you would waste more effort battling the wind compared to the hill. Otherwise on a circular course flat will be quicker due to frictional losses on the slow climb and increased wind losses on the descent. 

Just to add another answer. This year I rode the 210km Eroica Italia. That requires using a bike that is pre 1987. Mine was from 1980. A reasonably high level steel framed race bike with 12 sp gears. Campag wheels, Shimano 600 gears (similar to Ultegra today). cost me 100 bucks. 

At 10 o'clock there is a wedge that holds the handlebar. Taking off the plastic cap at the end of the stem reveals the bolts for tightening the stem and handlebar. 

The most practical approach we found for larger posters was trailers. Like this They're somewhat inclined to fall over in the wind so you have to be a little cautious, but the group who were using them lent them out to a range of people without any problems (other than getting the trailers back afterwards). You can attach the same A frames to a loadbike if you have one. Up to about A3 you can strap to your back, ideally to a backpack, or to the sides of a rear rack. I've either laminated posters or printed on coreflute, then stapled them to a wooden frame and cable tied them to the bike. The problem is that you have to print large for people to be able to read it, and that means "BIKES GOOD" rather than a paragraph. The graphic below I stole from a guy in Sydney because it's IMO good - simple, easy to grasp and direct. You could leave the "critical mass" off if you wanted to, obviously. 

To me it depends more on road and traffic conditions than age. If your roads are potholes linked by mounds of gravel and inhabited by mining trucks doing 100kph, 16 years old is too young. If you've got good roads with low speed limits and lots of bicycles, I'd be happy picking mother and child up from the hospital on a bakfiets. You should also be an experienced cyclist, used to the bike you'll be using to carry the baby. At the very least you should be long past the point where you ever accidentally drop the bicycle while stopping, for example. Your skill level should match where you're riding with the baby. There's two considerations for the bicycle: use a suitable baby-carrier designed for new babies (they usually have their own extra suspension, and the baby lies flat); I would run the fattest tyres I could get and keep the front one soft, just for a bit of extra padding on the bumps. Usual caveats about making sure the baby does not get cold/ hot/ wet/ dry/ hungry/ bored/ overstimulated etc apply :) In Australia I don't think there are any standards-approved newborn carriers for bikes, but I believe the Gazelle Cabby MaxiCosi was being considered so that may have happened (the problem is that the standard doesn't really have a "baby seat for bicycle" category, and the motor vehicle standard doesn't work). I have seen a baby less than 6 months old in a generic "baby basket" loose in the front of a bakfiets in town. Mother and baby were quite happy with that arrangement. But really, I think it's mostly about the road conditions. Smooth roads, well shared mean you can carry almost anything. 

I suggest taking it back to the shop you got it from, as it looks like a manufacturing defect. Since the bubble isn't visible on the inside it's clear that the layers of cloth inside the tyre have separated, and that's not supposed to happen. You should be able to get a warranty replacement. Sheldon Brown has an explanation of how the tyre is made that may help you picture what's going on: $URL$ 

My theory is endorphins. Our bodies generate them when we exercise. Or not, when we stop. All those days of steadily pumping out the good stuff makes the tour feel great but when I stop, ooops. I suggest you not try replacing them with synthetic endorphins as those are illegal and tend to be more addictive. There's also a body habit transition, where a bunch of the cycles in my body are set up for big exercise every day and suddenly I'm back behind a desk 8 hours a day. Half an hour each way does not cut it, I'm barely warmed up by then. So I bloat (very thirsty in the morning but then water retention), feel stiff but twitchy, and after the first couple of days tend to lose interest in food. This is my body saying "hey, you used to exercise, what happened to that?" What works for me is: 

The problem definitely been solved, and you probably see the solution in use every day. They're called "safety bicycles" because they're, well, safer. A suggested, once you have a safer frame design there are many brake designs to choose from, but on an ordinary your choices are basically air resistance and facial ablation. One cause of the confusion in naming is that when safety bicycles were introduced in the 1890's the existing bikes were called ordinaries because that's what an ordinary bicycle looked like. The new-fangled things with little wheels, low seats and pneumatic tyres were called safety bicycles as a marketing strategy to differentiate them from the other sort. These days it's the other way round - ordinaries are rare, and safety bicycles are ubiquitous. Since then we've gained recumbents (not invented until the 1930's) and the "safety" has split into a whole range of sub-types.
