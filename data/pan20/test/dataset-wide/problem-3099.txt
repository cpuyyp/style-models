Can anyone provide more convincing evidence about when and where tofu was invented? The Wilkinson passage implies but does not state directly that tofu originated as a food specifically for vegetarians. Is there any evidence that this is the case? 

I’m reading William Skinner’s “Chinese Society in Thailand” (1957). He notes that of the various speech-groups from different parts of south China that came to live in Siam, the Hainanese were one of the least prominent, yet they were also the first to strike out beyond Bangkok and the coastal areas to engage in petty trading along the northern riverways in the upcountry. Skinner postulates several reasons for people from Hainan taking this pioneering role, in place of the Teochius, Hokkiens, Cantonese or Hakkas, who tended to dominate in other areas of endeavor. One of them has to do with resistance to disease: 

Finally, a related question: Soy milk is now commonly consumed at breakfast along with fried doughnuts in China. When did this practice come about? 

The Wikipedia page on tofu states that this food was first produced in Han dynasty China. However, the source cited seems to me quite doubtful: 

It is well-known that Nietzsche’s sister, Elisabeth Foerster-Nietzsche, was a nationalist and anti-semite who took control of her brother’s papers on his death and propagated a distorted version of his thinking in tune with her own views. As a review of Ben Macintyre’s biography of her puts it, 

Subsistence farmers don’t need to read a calendar to go about their business. The knowledge they need can be passed down very effectively in oral form. If they practice shifting cultivation, as is still done in many parts of the world, they don’t actually own the land they farm, so inheritance in our terms isn’t an issue. What’s more, usually the “common spoken language” of such communities differs significantly from that which is represented in writing. In effect, learning to write means learning a new dialect/language, which requires people who speak that language to come to the community/village and set up a school. For widespread literacy, a whole infrastructure of schools manned by people who speak the central language is needed. Such projects must be carried out by states. Historians who have studied this (cf. “Peasants into Frenchmen” by Eugen Weber) argue that in bringing about widespread literacy, states in effect create “nations.” Actually, states can interact well enough with their subjects in the villages without widespread literacy. It helps to have someone literate who can read decrees to the peasants, demand their produce or labor etc. But that role can be filled by some intermediate class, effectively a tiny percentage of the population. Having too many literate people actually makes the system more difficult to manage.

Leary, Violence and the Dream People: The Orang Asli in the Malayan Emergency, 1948-1960. Leary fought on the British side during the Emergency, and his major thesis is that anthropologists who paint a picture of Senoi culture as inherently non-violent have it all wrong. He relates numerous cases of unprovoked violence, even massacres, on the part of the Senoi during the conflict (where both sides were attempting to secure their allegiance.) For example:

In other words, Austrians like Hitler liked to think they were “more German than the Germans,” and growing up in a state being torn apart by ethnic tensions was the context for (and first step in) the process (so perverse and distressing to contemplate) of Hitler’s development as a national radical. “Austrian nationalism” would be an oxymoron in this context. 

Elsewhere Wilkinson mentions that soybeans are indigenous to China and have been cultivated since the Zhou dynasty (so more than 2000 years ago.) The soy products from this earlier date are soy sauce and related fermented foods that have a strong, tangy taste, very different from the blandness of tofu. My questions: 

Endymion Wilkinson’s Chinese History: A Manual (rev. edition 2000) is a more reputable source. Here is what he states about the origins of tofu: 

My question: When and under what circumstances did Elisabeth Nietzsche meet Hitler? More generally, where could we find more examples of spoken statements by E. F-N. where she (mis)applies her brother’s thought to Hitler or to the Nazi regime more broadly? 

The picture referred to, an etching, was put up for auction in 2009, according to the New York Times,

According to one book about them (R. Jumper, Death Waits in the Dark: The Senoi Praaq, Malaysia's Killer Elite), they use blowguns as well as more conventional weapons. Wikipedia: 

This seems plausible, but can anyone corroborate it? Was Hainan known as an especially pestilential place? Presumably this would have delayed its settlement by Han Chinese earlier on. Also, has there been any confirmation in medical or genetic studies today? 

The Times article (link here) shows that there are many holes in the story. It quotes authoritative historians like Richard Evans and Richard Pipes, who judge the picture to be an obvious fake. 

In 1984, Margaret Thatcher and Deng Xiaoping negotiated the British handover of Hong Kong to China 15 years later. Recently released archival documents suggest that one of Thatcher’s prime concerns was to further British business interests in China. From a recent news report: 

Farmers in China, Japan and Korea use human waste as fertilizer. But farmers in other parts of Asia where the main crop is paddy rice, like Thailand and Malaysia, do not. Some sources (like King 1911) argue that this was necessary in order to maintain soil fertility and support large populations over centuries of continuous use of fields. But online sources are quite vague about when the practice started – the Wiki entry on night soil mentions the 9th century in Japan, and McGarry gives the Yuan dynasty (circa 13th century). Often it’s just “thousands of years.” Do we know anything about when precisely the use of night soil began? Presumably it originated in China. It would be interesting if we could show that this was an innovation that resulted from population pressure or some other change in the ecosystem. References from this page: $URL$ 

The Karaim and Tatar communities in the vicinity of Trakai date from the time of Vytautas. The Karaim spoke a similar language to the Tatars, but they weren’t Muslims, instead they professed a heterodox version of Judaism. These people may have worked as castle guards, and they seem to have regarded Vytautas as their patron and protector. There are a number of versions of the legend of Vytautas’s horse available on the internet, but none of them include this detail about women being banned from the castle. Women like Vytautas’s queen certainly lived there. If you look at a map of Trakai, there are many lakes, and the legend purports to explain how one of them came about. Here’s my translation of a rather elaborate version of the legend. The teller was an ethnic Karaim named S. Charčenko.
