Szemerédi’s theorem, that inside a positive-density set of naturals there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. To quote Terry Tao, "...the pieces of Szemerédi’s proof are highly interlocking, particularly with regard to all the epsilon-type parameters involved; it takes quite a bit of notational setup and foundational lemmas before the key steps of the proof can even be stated, let alone proved... Many years ago I tried to present the proof, but I was unable to find much of a simplification, and my exposition is probably not that much clearer than the original text." 

ADDED: The best references I have found are [Incitti] for classical groups and [Hultman] in general, but neither quite answers the above, as far as I can tell. 

In general, $V_{k\rho} \cong \bigotimes\limits_{\beta\in \Delta_+} (\mathbb C_{k\beta/2} \oplus \mathbb C_{(k-2)\beta/2} \oplus \ldots \oplus \mathbb C_{-k\beta/2})$ as $T$-representations, provable via WCF. Hence the dimension of the zero weight space, for $k=2$, is the number of labelings of $\Delta_+$ with coefficients $\{\pm 1,0\}$ and total vector sum zero, if you consider that an answer. 

If $\alpha$ is a long root (e.g. if $\mathfrak g$ is simply-laced), then $e_\alpha$ is in the $G$-orbit of the high weight vectors. Projectively, its orbit looks like $G/P_\Theta$ where $P_\theta$ is the parabolic using those simple roots that are perpendicular to the highest root. But you asked for the root vectors, not all the vectors. Then the answer is that you get all the root vectors for roots of the same length as $\alpha$. 

Here's two natural things to ask about any compact group action on a compact manifold: (1) what are the (finitely many) conjugacy classes of stabilizer groups? Assume our group is a torus, so we can omit "conjugacy classes of". (2) For each such stabilizer, what are the (finitely many) components of its fixed point set? So, we have a poset of such submanifolds, and a torus subgroup for each. Now comes the additional question in the Hamiltonian situation: (3) what's the moment polytope for each of these submanifolds? In actual examples, (1-3) are easy to figure out, and it's silly to answer (3) only for the whole manifold (or one might say, only for the fixed points). You ask if $H^*_T(X;\mathbb Q)$ can be computed from this sort of data alone. In the case that the minimal strata in (2) are all $S^2$s, $X$ is called a GKM space (for Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson), and indeed it can; it's easy to find references with that keyword. 

2-color your Dynkin diagram, black and white. Let $w$ be the product of the white simple reflections, $b$ the product of the black. Note that $w$ and $b$ are well-defined, as the reflections you're multiplying to make them, commute. You'll have to pick the order if you want an actual word, in what follows. If $G$ is not $A_{even}$: the affinization of the diagram is also 2-colorable, so you can choose the affine vertex to be white. Let $\chi = w b$, a Coxeter element. The Coxeter number $h$ is even, and $\chi^{h/2} = w_0$. So you get a reduced word $wbwbwb\ldots wb$, where the total number of letters is $h$ (and each letter is a product of commuting reflections). If $G$ is, unfortunately, $A_{even}$: you have to pick $w$ vs. $b$, and the diagram automorphism shows that the choice is unavoidable. The Coxeter number is odd. But you still get a reduced word, $wbwb\ldots bw$, again with $h$ letters. 

This is an idle question, but I give the example that motivated me below. Say $X \subseteq {\mathbb A}^n_k$ is irreducible and $k$ is infinite. Then by picking a regular point of $X$ and picking equations from $X$'s ideal that cut out $T_x X$, we get a scheme containing $X$ as a component. 

Obviously these maps aren't $\Gamma$-equivariant. The natural map is $V \otimes {\mathbb C}^2 \to W$, so maybe these other maps correspond to choosing a vector, or a list of vectors, in ${\mathbb C}^2$. So a more specific version of the question: 

I don't like this statement. I want this self-intersection to be (at least formally) zero-dimensional, not one-dimensional like the generic point of the curve. I regard Fulton's as the now-standard presentation of intersection theory. There, the intersection of $C$ and $D$ inside $X$ is defined for $C$ regularly embedded (which I think of as a cap product, $C$ in cohomology and $D$ in homology): one replaces $D$ by the normal cone $N_{D\cap C} D \subseteq N_C X$, and the intersection is the class $[N_{D\cap C} D] \in A(N_C X) \cong A(C) \to A(X)$, where the (Gysin) isomorphism used is only available because $C$ was regularly embedded (meaning, its normal cone is a vector bundle). That isomorphism changes degree by ${\mathrm {codim}}\ C$. The canonical, geometric object here representing the intersection is the scheme $N_{D\cap C} D$, defining an effective class on $N_C X$. But we want a cycle in $C$, and we may not be able to get one, because the Gysin isomorphism may take this effective class to a possibly ineffective one on $C$. That's life, of course -- your $C\cdot C$ may be negative. But anyway, under the standard presentation the resulting class is then a negative multiple of the ordinary, not generic, point class on $C$. 

Answerlet: it's either in ${\mathfrak so}(26)$ or ${\mathfrak sp}(13)$, that is to say, it's either a complexification of a real representation or forgetful from a quaternionic representation. Indeed, this is true of every irrep of $F_4$. I don't instantly know which one occurs for your particular irrep. Proof: $F_4$ has no Dynkin diagram symmetries, so the automorphism of the dominant Weyl chamber taking an irrep to its dual must be trivial. So $V \cong V^* $. Then the $F_4$-invariant inner product on $V$ lives either in $Sym^2 V$ or $Alt^2 V$, whence the dichotomy. 

We believe the rule for multiplying by a single box is $$ S_{\square} S_\lambda = \sum_{\nu \supset \lambda,\ \nu\ \subseteq \lambda_+} S_\nu $$ where $\lambda_+$ is defined as follows, for $\lambda$ an English partition: draw the $i=j$ line from the NW corner of the partition to where it meets $\lambda$ at $(p,p)$, push all the edges on the NE side of $(p,p)$ one step to the right, all edges on the SW side one step down, and push $(p,p)$ out to $(p+1,p+1)$. Examples: if $\lambda = (k)$, i.e. a single row, then $\lambda_+ = (k+1,2)$. $(3,1,1) \mapsto (4,2,1,1), (3,3,1) \mapsto (4,4,3,1)$. (There's a similar rule for the $K$-theory product, where $\lambda_+$ is $\lambda$ plus boxes at all its inner corners. That's not the $\lambda_+$ above.) 

Then the map $T\times G \to G\times G \to G$ is Poisson, likewise for $U$. What's more interesting is that $T$'s Poisson structure is trivial, but $U$'s isn't, so each $\{t\}\times G\to G$ is an ichthyomorphism, but most $\{u\} \times G \to G$ aren't. EDIT: I misread the action. See the comment below. 

What are other examples? Is there a general theory of these, that in particular would encompass Peter-Weyl? (So not just about actions on symmetric algebras.) 

Let $P$ be the convex hull of a finite set of points in $\mathbb Z^d$, and $p(n) = \#\{nP \cap \mathbb Z^d\}$ be its Ehrhart polynomial, which is also the Hilbert polynomial of the corresponding projective toric variety. If we write it as $\sum_{k=0}^d c_k {n \choose k}$, then since $p$ is $\mathbb Z$-valued, the $c_k$ are also in $\mathbb Z$; one can compute $c_k$ as $(\Delta^k p)(0)$ where $(\Delta q)(m) = q(m)-q(m-1)$. 

There are conjectural ones in the Berenstein-Zelevinsky paper referenced in that one. They have another paper with a general theorem, Tensor product multiplicities, canonical bases and totally positive varieties, that gives (many) polyhedral models for any Lie type. 

EDIT: "If it existed" was a lousy way to talk about that finite-dimensional irrep. As Ben points out, Borel-Weil-Bott makes clear that it does exist but is $0$. 

Certainly, if $G$ has a central extension, $G$ will act on the coadjoint orbits of the central extension. So I think your question might be "When can we be sure that our group has no central extensions?" The central extensions of the Lie algebra are given by elements of $H^2({\mathfrak g})$. So you want that to vanish, which it does for e.g. compact semisimple groups. The two cautionary examples to keep in mind are ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$ acting on $T^* {\mathbb R}^n$ by translation, which leads one to the Heisenberg group central extension of ${\mathbb R}^{2n}$, and the free loop group $LK$ acting on the based loop space $\Omega K \cong LK/K$, which leads one to the affine Lie group central extension of $LK$. There, $H^2(L{\mathfrak K}) = H^2(LK) = \pi_2(LK)^* = \pi_3(K)^* = H^3(K)$ which is one-dimensional for $K$ simple and simply-connected. There is an (in my opinion wrongheaded) definition of moment map that includes the composite ${\mathcal O} \hookrightarrow \widetilde{\mathfrak g}^* \twoheadrightarrow {\mathfrak g}^*$ where the first map is the inclusion of the coadjoint orbit, and the latter uses a noncanonical splitting of the central extension $\tilde{\mathfrak g}$. You can recognize this in the literature when people speak of "non-equivariant moment maps". Horrible. If a central extension is implicit I'd rather it be explicit. 

Parts 1 & 3 apply to any branching problem (and much further). Part 2 is special to your case that $L$ has the same rank as $G$ (I'm not actually using that it's a Levi). If all you want is an upper bound, as your comment to Jim suggests, then that's easy: the $L$-high weights that can occur are a subset of the $T$-weights that occur, which you already described. Probably you want something better than that though. In principle it wouldn't be too hard to figure out the local structure of your polytope nearby the regular vertices, but I expect that not all facets contain regular vertices. Littelmann describes (in the case of a Levi) the highest weights that occur and their multiplicities: one looks at all the Littelmann paths for the irrep $V_\lambda$ that lie entirely inside the closed $L$-chamber. 

Yes. Otherwise there would be an isolated ramification point in $Y$. A link of that point is $S^3$, which does not have a nontrivial double cover. So upstairs, $X$ looks near that point like two ${\mathbb C}^2$s glued at a point, which isn't smooth. 

This is another version of Reimundo Heluani's answer, avoiding perverse sheaves. In general, the $H$-orbits on $H/P \times H/Q$ are indexed by $W_P \backslash W_H/W_Q$. If $H = {}^L G(\mathcal K)$, so $W_H$ is the affine Weyl group $W_G \ltimes $[the weight lattice], and $P=Q={}^LG(\mathcal O)$, then $W_P \backslash W_H/W_Q =$ dominant weights. For $L,L' \in \mathcal Gr$, write $L \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} L'$ if $(L,L')$ is in the $\lambda$-orbit, for $\lambda$ a dominant weight. Now consider the space of "triangles" $$\mathcal V_{\lambda\mu\nu} := \{(L,L') : L,L' \in \mathcal Gr, base \stackrel{\lambda}{\to} L \stackrel{\mu}{\to} L' \stackrel{\nu}{\to} base \}$$ and I believe the statement is that $V_{\lambda\mu\nu} \cong H_{top}(\mathcal V_{\lambda\mu\nu})$. 

Let me answer the question, under a different interpretation of the word "why". First, what is the cohomology product [X] [Y] about, where X,Y are cycles and [X],[Y] their Poincar\'e duals? You could say it measures the inability to extricate X from Y. Now, let's try to extricate the origin from itself, where [pt] denotes the class of the origin in a vector space V. Pretty easy (if dim V > 0). So we'd say [pt]^2 = 0. Equivariantly, though, we may have trouble; there may be no nearby T-fixed points. This is exactly the question of whether there are any 0 weights in the action of T on V. So [pt]^2 should be some multiple of [pt], that vanishes iff there's a 0 weight. Moreover it should be homogeneous of degree = codim(pt in V). Plus it should behave well under shrinking T. These come pretty close to forcing it to be the product of the weights. 

In characteristic 2, $B_2$ and $F_4$ each have an outer automorphism, and in characteristic 3, so does $G_2$. This is relevant when you want to construct the twisted Chevalley groups, which use a Chevalley group over a finite field, and take the invariants under a field automorphism times an outer automorphism. 

In general if $T$ acts on a projective variety $X$ with moment polytope $\Phi(X)$, then a general point $x\in X$ will have $\Phi(\overline{T\cdot x}) = \Phi(X)$ i.e. be an abnormal toric variety with this same polytope. In the case of Grassmannians, Fink and Speyer prove that the variety is in fact normal, and I expect this works in other minuscule cases. The close relation you claim is a map: take $y\in G/B$, $\pi:G/B\to G/P$, and look at $\overline{T\cdot y} \twoheadrightarrow \overline{T\cdot \pi(y)}$, inducing maps between their moment polytopes and normalizations. 

I very nearly wrote my PhD thesis on this topic. Here's as much as I was able to figure out, though it's hardly a direct answer to your question. 1) Say your total space is K\"ahler, and your fibers are compact. Then you can define a Levi-Civita connection on any open set consisting of smooth fibers. It turns out that this connection generates symplectomorphisms between the fibers. 2) In toric degenerations, the torus acts on the total space of the family, mostly moving them around, but preserving the zero fiber (which is why it's toric). 1+2?) Now imagine you use (1) to give a map from your general fiber $F_1$ to your special fiber $F_0$. Map further, to ${\mathfrak t}^*$, using the moment map on the toric variety. Now you have an integrable system on $F_1$, stolen from $F_0$! There's a problem: since $F_0$ isn't smooth, we can't actually use (1) to make the map. The hope is to take limits along the horizontal vector field to define a continuous function $F_1 \to F_0$. 3) It turns out that this is the same as following the gradient flow for the norm square of the moment map. And limits of real-analytic gradient flows on smooth varieties are well-understood, by Lojasiewicz. So if your total space is smooth, you can use this to show that the map $F_1 \to F_0$ is well-defined, continuous, and smooth away from the singularities in $F_0$. I never got around to investigating how things change if the total space is singular (as in the Gel'fand-Cetlin-Sturmfels-Gonciulea-Lakshmibai degeneration motivating the questioner, and me too). Of course you can pick a resolution of singularities, and I guess you can ask that the metric on the exceptional fibers be very very small, and use that to generalize Lojasiewicz' results. But I never worked on this seriously. Example: Let the family be $det : C^{2\times 2} \to C$. Then the $0$ fiber is the cone over $P^1 \times P^1$, so a toric variety, but the fiber over $1$ is $SL(2)$. That has a $T^2$ action, by left and right multiplication by its maximal torus, but doesn't have the rescaling action that the $0$ fiber enjoys. One can actually solve the ODE defined by the Levi-Civita/gradient flow and write down the map $SL(2) \to det^{-1}(0)$. It collapses $SU(2)$ to the singular point $0$. What is the integrable system? Regard $SL(2)$ as $T^* S^3$, and the action variable as $(p,\vec v) \mapsto |\vec v|$. This generates unit-speed gradient flow on $T^* S^3$, which breaks down at zero vectors (the $SU(2) = S^3$) because they don't know which direction to go.
