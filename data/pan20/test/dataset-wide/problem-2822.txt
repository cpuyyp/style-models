A good place to start would be the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article Jacques Lacan as well as the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article Jacques Lacan (1901â€”1981). The SEP article has a very comprehensive bibliography listing both primary and secondary literature relating to Lacan's ideas. The IEP article has an entire section devoted to Lacan's ideas about "subject" which starts by asserting: 

The answer cannot be found within a logical argument alone. Metaphysical stances on time To quote the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: 

The neural networks proved to be able to cluster together semantically similar sentences with good probability, but proving their ability to separate the individual semantic components of the sentences into well defined clusters would be much more powerful. One other important question to ask is the question "do these results hold any implication for the objections to the language of thought hypothesis?" If these results could somehow answer some of the objections they would be much stronger support for the hypothesis. The IEP defines a potentially fatal problem for the language of thought hypothesis: 

The first four chapters of The Oxford Handbook of The History of Analytic Philosophy are available for free from that webpage. The four chapters are: 

These formulae obviously do not have the same form, one of them is a disjunction between two formulae and one of them is the negation of one formula. In the above example of our axiom scheme we state that there are infinitely many axioms of the same form, ones that have the form of an implication, P -> Q. Obviously A v B and ~A are not the same form as P -> Q. Yes, the form of an axiom and the axiom itself are different. Again, this is because with an axiom we are substituting in specifics. That is what is meant by "Let P, Q and S by any formulas" in the text you quoted, in those schema P, Q, and S are not actual formulae, they are dummy variables that we are using as placeholders. To get a real axiom you substitute in actual examples from the language. (A -> B), (B -> A), (A -> A) all have the same form and they are obviously not the same axiom, they are examples of substituting in different particulars. I can understand how this can be confusing if P is actually in the language but that's why the author clarifies with "let them by any", they are not saying only, P -> Q is an axiom, they are saying there is an infinite list of all formulae of the form P -> Q, e.g., again, (A -> B), (B -> A), etc. From Wikipedia's article Logical form: 

Modern definition of science doesn't pretend it is a method for finding the truth. At best it is a way to produce a unfalsified falsifiable theory, that is a theory for which you know what kind of experimental results would deny its validity but no experimental result did. Border cases like water memory, the sokal affair, epistemological anarchism and Anything Goes: Origins of the Cult of Scientific Irrationalism are some topics one interesting in the social aspect of Science may want to look at. 

You will probably want to document on constructionism. (Please try to put a question in your title and to use the description to specify your request.) 

First this question assume that you know that you are going to die. But you may attach different meaning to "knowing something", or awareness level if you prefer. You know that you are going to die may be a vague knowledge like "first known written texts are dated 5000BCE": you heard it, you retained it, most probably you didn't try to check it, and it have little impact on your daily decisions. At the extreme opposite there are visceral knowledge: you have to drink and eat. Probably not everybody have the same awareness of its own mortality, and with other factors, that may make considerable differences on how one is influenced by this knowledge. 

To answer such a question, you have to define a criteria on which you order and a way to finitely determine a rank in this order for each being you want to order. You can of course chose criteria that fit your initial expected result, for example here "I know I am going to die (don't) make me inferior/superior to all the other living creatures". What you may ask then is "is there some non-subjective/objective ordering I could use?". To my mind, the best you may expect is an univocal consensus, which in actual problems may seems next to impossible. 

Notice the difference between 1, 2, 3, and 4 when compared to 5 and 6. Yes it is common to use the word "philosophy" in a non strict sense that isn't referring to the academic discipline. As an example to illustrate the difference between 1 and 6: Personally, I am a physicalist as well as a scientific realist in regards to metaphysics, I am a logicist when it comes to the philosophy of mathematics and I'm an epistemic realist. But, none of those ideas are unique to me. You wouldn't say, using the 3rd definition, that "physicalism is the philosophy of Not_Here" because I didn't invent physicalism, I haven't contributed major theories to physicalism, etc. You would use it in the 1st definition to say that "the philosophy of Not_Here includes physicalism and logicism" because its describing my specific philosophical beliefs. That is completely different than the 3rd definition which describes the unique ideas philosophers have contributed to discussions and the study of those systems of ideas that were unique to them. 

Additionally, if you go to the disambiguation of the word "thesis" on wikipedia you see that in the subjects of mathematics and logic it links to "hypothesis" and "conjecture" as well. An example of a mathematical thesis is the Church-Turing thesis which, as you can see, is also sometimes called the Church-Turing conjecture and is described in that article as being a hypothesis. The reason that the Church-Turing thesis is a thesis is because it tries to take an informal idea (the idea of an algorithm) and give it a precise mathematical statement. Due to the fact that it starts with an informal idea, there isn't a purely deductive way to prove that the idea is true, therefore it's left open as a hypothesis and would be proven untrue if a counter example is shown. As such, mathematical conjectures, theses, and hypotheses are statements in mathematics that seem probable and no counter example has yet been shown. This means that conjectures have yet to be proven, which delineates them from theorems. A theorem is something that is not a conjecture, it is something that has been proven true. From Mathworld: 

The question may gain distinguishing what kind of validity you are seeking for. On the one hand, you may be "simply" interested in using the state of the art mathematical tools to ensure that your engineering project as a consistent specification and that the thing that you built map exactly that. If that's what you are interested for, proof assistant may be an interesting entry point. On the other hand you may be interested with more ontological concerns, like knowing if mathematical objects reveals eternal underlying truths or if their are just mere mental representations resulting from an ugly patchwork of cognitive biases. If that's what you are looking for, you may look up for realism, idealism, solipsism as entry points. 

You don't only act based on what you think about people, but also on what you think would happen if you acted in one manner or an other. You may think that no one is perfect, that to err is human, but that with encouragements, people have better chances to achieve goals. So I would say you can sincerely trust someone and still have some doubts on the result of their actions. From doubt to anxiety, there is only a little step, whether you consider that a mistrust step is up to you. You can even even wonder, aren't you mistrusting yourself? That is, your ability to live placidly whatever uncertain events may happen? 

Assuming you have ten fingers and that you begin to count at zero, using only fingers as an atomic information storage, you may count up to 210-1=1023. Now you may use your fingers as "non-atomic" information storage. For example there's a technique which use the three visible division of each finger and use the thumb to mark one of the other digit of the same hand. This way you can easily count to 12 on one hand. There are also other techniques which enable to count bigger number on one hand. Moreover in your example, the user must remember in his mind how many times he used each hand. So it's not a pure finger coding technique but a mix with mind memory. 

Quantum complexity theory exists and it is one of the fastest growing fields in computer science. The answer to how this occurs will come out of an elaboration on your first question, the question of how do we treat the ontological status of probability amplitudes. In quantum mechanics we deal with what are called probability amplitudes. Probability amplitudes differ from probability distributions; amplitudes can be negative and complex numbers while distributions cannot. The reason this works is because the absolute value of the amplitude is squared before it is treated like a normal probability; this assures us that we will never end up with a negative probability. All of the much discussed "weird" or "counterintuitive" aspects of quantum mechanics are due to the fact that probability amplitudes can cancel each other out. This is just how the formalism works, it's a property of complex numbers. The question you're asking is one of the most central questions in the philosophy of physics; it is the most central question in the philosophy of quantum mechanics without a doubt. The general discussion of the question "how should we understand the ontological status of probability amplitudes" falls under the label of interpretations of quantum mechanics. From the Wikipedia article on interpretations of quantum mechanics: 

Formalism, as studied today, is slightly different in content than Hilbert's, as is outlined in the SEP article. However, at its core formalism is the view that mathematical and logical content is nothing more than the effects of specific syntactical rules, i.e. string manipulation. As such, formalism is considered to be a form of mathematical anti-realism. Logicism Formalism can be, for conceptual and historical reasons, compared and contrasted with logicism. Logicism is the philosophical view that mathematics can be reduced to logic, and therefore mathematics is merely just a larger part of logic as a whole. Historically, logicism was defending and elaborated on by Frege, Dedekind, Peano, and Russell, among others. Frege's goal for logicism was to create a purely logical system that could provide all of the truths about arithmetic. He failed to do so, as his system was subject to Russell's paradox. Russell attempted himself to create a system that avoided this and a few other paradoxes, his system of Principia Mathematica which laid the foundation for type theory. Kurt GÃ¶del's metamathematical results about PM (and all other logical systems capable of Robinson arithmetic), his incompleteness theorems, seemed to many to be a final blow to logicism, in that no single logical system will ever be able to encompass all truths of mathematics and at the same time prove that itself is consistent. Some modern interest has been paid to a revival of logicism, called neo-logism, due to the work of Crispin Wright showing that Frege's original plan might be salvageable by replacing his Basic Law V (the cause of the failure of his system, besides the failure GÃ¶del's results would imply) with Hume's Principle. Current criticism of neo-logicism is that it still fails to address some philosophical issues raised by logicism such as the Julius Caesar problem. Logicism may be neutral on the ontological status of mathematical objects. What is important to note is that logicists agree that logical truths are just that, truths. More specifically, they agree that logical truths are analytic truths, truths that are guaranteed to be true by the very nature of their definitions, and are knowable a priori, knowable without direct experiences. An important note is the disagreements Frege and Hilbert had about the role logic and axioms play in mathematics. This debate was centered around the proper role that axioms play in logical systems and how we should interpret them. As such, this debate exemplifies many of the tenants that contrast formalism with logicism. From the SEP: 

Now, even in the last case, the problem is that even if it's true, as a human being you can't access absolute certitude that the entity which promise you the safe sandbox is really what he pretend to be. Believe it would be an act of faith completely drived by your hope it's true, ignoring your awareness that it may be false. And this awareness is provided precisely by your critical mind, the safeguard that you should abandon to check whether it was true or not. And once you abandon this safeguard, there's no guaranty you can have it back. So I would say that this category of problem rely on the false assumption that you may be in a situation of perfect certitude that you'll live the promised situation. To me it sounds exactly like "if you accord to someone that everything he may say is true, then for you everything he will say will be true". The reasoning may be valid, but to my mind premises are seriously doubtful. 

Don't you think you also tend to build continue representation of obviously discrete objects? Think how films are working: 27 pictures per seconds and there you think it's a continuous movement. Your mind even don't bother to inform your conciseness it's an illusion. Both discrete and continue approach are used in our everyday representations of the world, as well as in abstract theories. 

I think that your question may be related to the more general "being assured that you'll live in full happiness, why would you refuse to enter into a system where you abandon critical mind which is bind to worrisome, and so decrease your happiness potential?". Formulated this way, I think it become even more clear that anyone pretending that he can guaranty you a completely safe sandbox is either : 

You may say that self-mortality awareness is just a byproduct of a representation ability that allow one to adapt its behavior with a large range of evolving situation. In this view, it would be more that self-mortality awareness and improvement of your own life by mind simulated scenario selection have a common cause, but not that the second depend on the first.
