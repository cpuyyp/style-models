Good question, except that the answer is worth at least one or two doctoral theses. The question is way above my own amateur level, so perhaps this should just be a comment. However, as far as I understand it, there is fairly good agreement on the ways in which Merleau-Ponty (and nearly all later phenomenologists) broke from many characteristic (and, in my view, interesting) features of early Husserl. But whether or not one can defend a "break" in Husserl around the time of the Crisis is hotly debated, as you suggest. While "authorial intent" may be anathema to modern theory, I do not see that there is any other definitive way to settle this question of a Husserlian "break." And here the author is dead, literally. My understanding is that even now there is a huge amount of untranslated and unpublished Husserl. It would be quite a labor to map out a clear line of thinking diverging radically from his initial idealist trajectory. And given the fertile influence of that trajectory, would it even be fair to do so? Not to say it won't be done. All of which is to suggest that this is a good, interesting question, you sound as qualified as anyone to pursue it further, and while I hope we get good answers, it may not be properly answerable without more time,debate, and scholarship passing under the bridge. 

I am really only asking if a concept of "direct knowledge transfer" or perhaps "downloads" exists as a point of discussion or study in philosophy and cognitive sciences. In information theory, we have a well-defined physics for transferring enormous quantities of "information" across various media. But information with "meaning" or that can be characterized as "knowledge" moves extremely slowly across nervous systems and cannot be synthesized or directly combined. Is there some area of study that defines and addresses this issue? Perhaps in attempts to "quantify" meaning or to "compute" directly through cells or to theorize what a direct mind-mind synthesis might mean? I suppose this is also another way of approaching old issues concerning limits of the "self." 

I may need to refine this question, since I am mostly grappling with a murky intuition and haven't yet done the real work. When I encounter many of the well-known paradoxes, such as Zeno's dichotomy, Russell's set containing itself, problems of "zero" and "one," the concept of the infinitesimal in calculus or a "point" in time, Hegel's "identity of identity and difference," even aspects of quantum indeterminacy, they all seem tantalizingly similar. They all seem to arrive at a point-position, like the "origin" in Cartesian coordinates, that must be defined as both "inside" and "outside" the totality under consideration. Or something like that. Is there some reduction of these and other paradoxes that is "more fundamental" or best clarifies what they have in common, some sort of meta-paradox? As I say, this may be either too wooly or something everyone with a background in logic already knows, but I thought I'd toss it out there. 

You do not believe in God, yet believe in belief. I would describe that position as pragmatist. Perhaps "pragmatic agnosticism" or "agnostic pragmatism," if you want a glossier label. For Pierce, James, and other pragmatists there can be no necessary and certain truths, so one could neither "prove" nor "disprove" the existence of God. Thus we are left with social consensus and the utility of our various beliefs. The beliefs that "work best" are socially retained, evolving by "unnatural selection." One might then accept faith in God as a secular version of Pascal's wager. Or not. There is, however, an entirely different strain of atheism you have not mentioned. This is known as "double truth," and is nicely discussed in Terry Eagleton's "Culture and the Death of God." The idea is best captured in Voltaire's famous quip "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him." Many Enlightenment figures did not believe in God, or at least not the personal, law-giving God of the bible, yet forbore to discuss such ideas "in front of the servants," as the saying went. While the educated Kantian or Humean might have ways to arrive via the crooked path of skepticism back at moral values, comfort, and hope, the common folk would do better not to set out on that path in the first place. Thus religion, the "opium of the masses," as Marx called it, must be preserved at all cost to maintain society, moral practice, solace, and hope. One might thus "believe in belief" in a purely cynical way or with utmost sincerity. If God is "necessary" to human existence, then perhaps that is as true an "existence" as we can find. In general form, this idea of the "necessary myth" extends beyond Christianity as far back as Plato's Republic and forward to Comte's "Religion of Humanity." And there is yet another, somewhat Hegelian, position that I myself profess. God did not create us, but is real in the sense that we are creating God. We are, quite literally, creating the "stuff of dreams" out of our sciences and enclosing ourselves in a panoptic, omniscience, perhaps with capacities for eugenic storage and resurrection. So whether we end up in heaven or hell really does depend on how faithfully we heed word of God. The good news is that He need not be modeled on a bitter, paranoid Middle-Eastern patriarch suffering from incestuous urges and auditory hallucinations. I am not sure if this has a name. Perhaps "prognosticism" would do. I believe Meillassoux offers a version of this in "After Finitude," but I haven't finished it yet. So you might consider a hopeful "prognosticism," since you have to tithe for it anyway. 

Certainly, science is possible in a world where God acts. After all, God can create such a world. And if this God is well-disposed towards scientists He may, deus absconditus, leave it at that, the "spring-loaded" God of Aristotle or Leibniz. And if God insists upon acting in the world, contravening the laws of nature, it becomes largely a matter of aesthetic judgement whether we call such acts random events, singularities, or miracles. Science can only assign probabilities, whether to quantum measurements or instances of witnessed resurrections. If we admit a world of singular events and probabilistic measurements, there are infinitely many quantum gaps in which God might reside and be "mysteriously" acting. To decide if some event is a "divine miracle" is a bit like sifting the airwaves for messages from extraterrestrial intelligences. Hard to rule out echo effects. If God acts ceaselessly, how would you distinguish Him from the constant hum of being? If He acts spontaneously, how would you distinguish Him from randomness? If He acts periodically in an intelligible manner, how do you distinguish Him from a probabilistic scientific law or some Kantian framework of the observer? The real question is: Is science possible in a world where people insist that God acts? Here, the answer is no. Science is not possible without a suspension of "that hypothesis," as Laplace called it. Where such explanations can be introduced, the scientific method of explanation is completely subverted. Science works, for better or worse, by a strict division of explanatory labor and a conditional assignment of God to the inconsequential. The price is paid with finitude. 

The proponent of a Humean stance has a very simple, straightforward, and widely accepted response: science is probabilistic. That was Hume's point. He is not concerned with whether or not we can usefully talk about "causality," the orders of events, or the psychology of attribution. He is doing a reductio ad absurdum of empiricism, pointing out that "forces" are not themselves observables, nor can they be shown to have any metaphysical necessity. No matter how many times we observe something, we must always make the inductive leap to assume it continues that way. There is no final proof that this "law" will always be the case. At that time, the assumption that "true" scientific laws were absolutely secure, in theory, and that "causation" was essential to the whole scientific project was largely unchallenged, except by the possible interventions of God. Like Berkeley's attack on "matter," Hume's simple billiard-ball model of "causality" was meant to show just how much metaphysical stuff remained unaccountable in the most basic "laws" of science. It is all induction, statistical regularities, local phenomena. Which is not "truth" but "good enough." Until the black swan appears, or we attain speeds where Newtonian mechanics no longer holds, or the sun indeed fails to rise. Kant awakes in alarm, refutations pour forth.... Though the issue is still open, today most scientists and "pragmatic" philosophers would accept Hume's probabilistic account, which entered science proper with Boltzmann's explanation of entropy and became doctrinal with the stunning success of quantum theory. Your counter-examples may raise interesting questions about language or the ontology of "forces," but I can't really make out that they are refutations of Hume.
