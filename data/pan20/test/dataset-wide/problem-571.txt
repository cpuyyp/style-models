I like that MEC jackets in general. But as you note, you will often get pretty sweaty with anything that does not vent hugely. Even in the most expensive GoreTex jacket you are still going to get sweaty. I am not convinced there is any actual great solution. There are just a series of lesser evils. MEC used to have a jacket long discontinued, and I treasure my one remaining example, that was SuperMicroft on the front, over polar fleece, and similar put different outer feel polar fleece for the back half. I rode in this as a winter coat for a decade. The idea is the front blocks the wind, the back vents the heat/sweat. In the winter, if I stopped at a light, my back would be steaming as the heat flows out. This was the best bet, since literally half you upper body surface area is a vent. Alas they (and Europe Bound) no longer sell them (at least last I looked, nor can I find them in the online catalog). I loved how in Toronto, every time MEC moved, Europe Bound opened a store across the street. That was pretty funny as a business plan! (Like when Starbucks opened in Toronto the joke was they mapped out all the Second Cup stores and opened as close as they could find a spot. No clue if really true, but sure looked that way!) 

For packing, a box from a bike shop will do fine and you can chuck it in the recycling when you get to Tokyo and find another before flying out. Most bike shops will give these to you if you ask nicely and even if they charge you, it ain't going to be much. A much bigger issue is airline choice. Options for flying with a bike range from free to pay by the kilo in excess charges to some obscene special bike charge. Read up and check the baggage allowances for sporting goods very carefully. If you fly a lot, get a loyalty card, the extra 10kg you get on most airlines' lowest tier covers a bike in a box nicely. And if you get some special luggage tags, that can't hurt either. My bike has survived a few flights totally unharmed, this was in a bike box though. Though I do have friends who have shipped a lot of bikes all over the place in cardboard and I've never heard of any problems. Not that it can't happen, it's just unlikely. You can't move for bikes/bike shops in Tokyo so getting spares isn't going to be an issue. Getting your bike stolen is not going to happen. Walking out of the secure side of an airport with a bike up your jumper is going to raise eyebrows. 

A Twist Resist will let you hold the spoke and resist the twisting. They're designed for holing spokes to prevent windup and spinning on straight pulls. The internet says you can use a cable holder in a pinch, or even some smooth jawed pliers. I'd be tempted to try thread lock on the hub end as a quick and dirty solution. 

There are two main types of cycle wheel, cup and cone and cartridge bearing. Cup and cone bearings are fairly easy to service yourself with some simple tools, normal and cup and cone spanners and some grease. Cartridge bearing hubs need more specialist tools, presses to install and drifts to knock the old bearings out. You can tell which sort you have by looking at the axle, if it's got a nut and a thin lock nut then it's probably cup and cone, google some pictures to see what they look like. If it is cup and cone then taking it apart (only undo 1 side btw or you'll lose the centre of the axle), cleaning the loose ball bearings you'll find under the cones, then regrease and reassemble may sort the problem; however if its actually as bad as you sugest the ball bearings may need replaced and if the races that the ball bearings sit on are pitted then the wheel may be beyond help. There are lots of videos on the web showing this process. If it's a cartridge bearing hub then your local shop might be the way to go unless you want to invest in some tools. 

Creaks are always difficult to track down, where the sound seems to come from is often no guide to the source. What is often the cause is the rear wheel, especially if its qr. Take the wheel out, clean the dropouts and wheel axle, a smear of grease on the dropout and reassemble. 

This depends on where you are to some extent. I would start by asking either the local police or council and if they're not interested a locksmith. Going with someone official makes the job look a lot less sketchy. Might be worth while having the receipt or some photos of you and the bike handy incase you're challenged. That said, most cable locks are pretty worthless and if you're not worried about getting stopped, some quality cable cutters or small bolt cutters would do the trick. And, yours isn't, but for combination locks, you can usually decode them by pulling on the lock body and turning the barrels gently until you feel a click. 

Oil damped forks lock out by closing a valve and stopping the flow of oil through the damper. The amount of lockout is usually adjustable by changing just how closed this valve is. But I can't find this anywhere in the manuals for your forks. It is possible that it's factory set, how much force are you using to get the fork to move the 20mm you mentioned? There is also a blow off valve for big hits, you could be activating that if you're jumping on it. If you can pedal standing up without it bobbing around excessively then the lockout is working as expected, if not it could mean an oil leak or that the forks came under filled. 

Another option would be Islabikes, they are a UK company but now have a US operation based in Portland. They are a specialist children's bike manufacturer with an emphasis on low weight and child specific components. 

If the cables are ok the next thing to check is the derailer alignment. The shop should have a tool to do this. You remove the derailer and the tool screws into the hanger. You rotate it to see if the hanger us bent. 

One last thing to consider is tubeless, you can get a conversion kit that allows you to run the wheel with no tube but with a sealant that plugs holes; this is how I run all of my bikes. It does however bring it's own problems, you can get a cut in the tyre that's too big for the sealant to cope with and access to a compressor is helpful when setting up a tubeless system. 

Standard V brakes do not work well with STI levers, they don't pull enough cable to allow the V brake to be setup properly; you end up with the pads so close to the rim that they are always rubbing on it or needing to be adjusted and the braking can also be poor. I know of 2 options to get around this, you get a V brake Travel Adjuster or Travel Agent - essentially a pulley that increases the amount of cable that is pulled by the STI shifter or you get some 'Mini V Brakes' as these have a shorter arm and so work with the STI shifters.
