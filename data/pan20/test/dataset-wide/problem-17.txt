If the people have motivation and cooperation then an easy solution would be a march on the capital. Something similar to the MLKJ march on Washington. If the government is corrupt, it is likely they would use the army to prevent this from happening, even going so far as to kill citizens. Harmless protests such as the Hong Kong protests, where the Chinese government gassed its own citizens. In situations like this, if the population really believed in its dream, they would over power the government in sheer numbers. Generally, the army is not big enough to fight off thousands of people pushing their way -- without fear of death -- to the capital to fight the oligarchy. Generally speaking, a government would not want to slaughter its citizens, no matter how corrupt. Being in places of power over people is only useful if those people are around, so if they are dead it will be hard to have the power. In addition, there are many political problems with mass slaughtering citizens; if there were another country like America in your world, it would most likely go to war with this man-slaughtering government. I digress, if the people have a spokesman who can rally them, it is usually game over for the government. If some politicians aren't corrupt then those politicians could influence governmental decisions by voting for or against certain actions. This is assuming it is a democracy, or some form of dictatorship in which more than one person is in charge. If it is only one person, politicians could over throw the president/chancellor/general by disobeying orders, whatever that entails. Not passing on information, causing the Commander and Chief to fall into a trap, perhaps. If a company has money then the company could buy out the politicians. Assuming they are corrupt, more money would be welcome. If the tech giant did not completely control the government (directly make decisions, such as "I pledge allegiance to the United States of Walmart"), then they would be able to manipulate the politicians to cast votes, or to not pass on information to their Commander and Chief, etc. If you're thinking the government would shut the business down, you're wrong. The business would be sensible enough to hire its own mercenaries and fight its way to the capital if need be, or at least defend its operations, factories/plants, and HQ. If there are immigrants then the new population could influence the votes in just a generation or two. This may seem racist, but flooding a country with new citizens has a huge impact. Once those citizens' children are of voting age, they could easily be 20% of the voting group, which is a big deal in politics. Such groups could even make their way into political offices, and get voted up the chain of command. In this case it would be best for each family to have four or five children to adequately increase the votes. If necessities are held hostage, such as water sources, food sources, and power sources, then those can be used as bargaining chips. If these are controlled by a company, a mass of citizens, or armed troops opposed to the government they can threaten the government by limiting access. Taking out Hoover Dam or a nuclear reactor would certainly slow things down and get attention. Notes Most of these situations assume that the population of each group act as one entity, like an ant colony. This is dire for the operations to work. One person in the group with information could leave the cause and foil all the plans, even get people killed. There needs to be trust, motivation, and leadership in any of these overthrowing parties. 

This mostly covers non-stealth attacks, in the idea of military combat or an arena fighting match. Neil better covers stealth, which would likely be the way all rewinders prefer to fight. Editted to readdress the OP's question. The rewinder with the most mental stamina would win every fight. For example, Bob would slash at Alice with a knife, then Alice would rewind in order to block/parry, then Bob would rewind to change his attack. These exchanges would continue until both parties are out of mental stamina. This means that stamina would act like "a shield", meaning you would want to preserve it. After all mental stamina is gone, the combatants would start taking real damage, and possibly be killed or beaten. Because of this, combatants would most likely allow attacks to land before rewinding, to see how lethal they are, and decide whether they want to waste stamina for a little pain or if they really do need their arm back. This would pose an advantage for poison wielders. If the poison can stop the defender from rewinding all together, than any attack would be a huge benefit. After the shield/stamina is gone, it is either whoever can endure the most pain and still fight, or who has the most skill. When exchanging in a gun fight, it would be more difficult to see the threats coming, meaning the rewinders would not be able to rewind before the attack hits them, but rather after. When Bob snipes Alice, she would rewind after there's a bullet in her shoulder, unless she can magically see the bullet. However, in anticipation of being hit, if there is enough distance between the attackers, the defender could rewind as soon as they hear a gun shot. This would potentially save them from being killed or knocked unconscious, so it would be the best move. However, this would lower stamina, making it a risk; if the bullet would have missed, the defender still wasted stamina rewinding. This means whoever fires more bullets would likely win. In ranged combat, the attacker has the advantage of surprise, because the defender is unable to see the attack and react fast enough. However, in this case both parties are very equal. If a shot is lethal, brain or heart wound, it can either instantly kill the defender or prevent them from rewinding. Overall melee fights of equal stamina would result in an ordinary knife fight, except there is a bit more strategy with which hits to take and which to avoid. A gun fight would result in both parties spamming their guns, wasting all their stamina, and then it would be a normal gun fight. 

There is very detailed discussion about this issue in the field of Astrobiology. There is many constrains for "reasonable" life. I will try to go through most of them in short points. Let me use following approximate definition of life in my answer: 

Local features Mountains Apart from the global circulation of the atmosphere, there is lot of local features, that can create deserts, for example. In my opinion, one should roughly imagine where the clouds are coming from and where do they go. Clouds appear above oceans, the warmer the region, the more clouds appear. Then, they follow the prevailing direction of winds. (See the discussion above.) If there are high mountains between, there will be a lot of precipitation on the side from where the clouds go, and dry region, possibly desert, after that. Continents The water slowly rains away above the land. Hundreds or thousands of kilometers in the middle of large continent, there will be a dry region with big temperature differences between summer and winter. (Or even within one day for slowly rotating planets.) This might go to extremes for large continents. 

With these assumptions, we can calculate how does the portal behave now. If previously, we calculated the difference in potential $\Delta \Phi = g h$, now this difference is reduced by the potential gain inside the portal equal to $a_g L$. So we have $$ \Delta \Phi=gh - a_g L\;. $$ With this assumption, now have to update the formula for $m_f$ to $$ m_f=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G}\;, $$ which leads to $$ a_g=\frac{2d(gh-a_g L)}{G} \cdot \frac{G}{r_g^2}\;. $$ By solving these two equations, we obtain the final formulas $$ \begin{align} a_g &= \frac{2 d g h}{2 d L+r_g^2}\;,\\ m_f &= \frac{2 d g h r_g^2}{2 d G L+G r_g^2}\;. \end{align} $$ As we can see, with large inner length $L$, the forces near the portals can be made arbitrarily small. It is still true that if you are going from the lower portal mouth to the higher one, you are going "uphill" and you must exert work. How does it look inside the portal? Interestingly, there would be no walls. The space wraps into itself, so it looks like if you are standing between four mirrors: all around, there are images of yourself and of other things inside the portal, just they are not images, but they are really there. You could see your own back. Conservation of Momentum The solution above conserves the energy properly. However, the energy is not the only thing that should be conserved. There is also momentum. With momentum, I do not have any nice idea how to put it into equations. But similarly to the previous case, I guess there would be forces acting on any entering object that change its momentum as it is passing through the portal. The forces would act both on the passing object and on the portal gates. If it is easier to rotate the portal gate so that the object would not change its direction of motion (yes, it could be easy - the portal gates could have negligible inertial mass), they would rotate to a proper position. If they are somehow fixed, the passing object would get strong kick from the portal and its momentum would be transferred to the portal gates. This would definitely not be pleasant experience if you are entering quickly - probably like hitting a concrete wall. Note I do not know if this is the solution you wanted, but it seems quite self-consistent to me. I definitely do not guarantee that it is consistent with the general relativity - it is probably not. (On one side because the portal gates are curvature o space and require extreme exotic mass, which brings additional effects. On the other side because the proposed model is not the only one - I know at least about one more consistent possibility, that is probably the case for wormholes. If you want to go this deep, you should be asking about wormholes, not portals. 

Imagine a world in which technology we would probably call "technological singularity" is possible and already happened on few places of the galaxy. By the singularity I do not mean that anything is possible, but rather that original biological species transform themselves into extremely highly intelligent computer programs with big amount of control of their environment, and they completely transcend their biological nature. The post-singularity societies might rebuild planets to giant computers or even create Matrioshka brains, since the main scarce resources are computer time and memory. It would be relatively easy for such civilization to send spaceships that would transform all solar systems in our galaxy into computers and utilize them. It would be even easy for a small splinter faction inside such civilization, unless the "official forces" actively prevent it. The motivation is simply a lot of resources and freedom to gain. My question is: Are there plausible reasons that would prevent it and keep the civilizations bound to their home star systems? If there is such, the reason should be strong and valid for all such civilizations. If nine out of ten civilizations decide not to spread, and one does, the galaxy will still be transformed.
