I will add that this all depends on one's definition of "good". If by "good for a baby" we mean "will increase the baby's intelligence," then I think the answer is: No, listening to classical music probably won't permanently increase a baby's intelligence. It might still be good, though, if it is soothing to the pregnant mother. If the music reduces the mother's stress, this is definitely good since stressors are directly linked to complications in pregnancy. That could be true of any style of music, though. 

The authors summarize their results by concluding that lump-sum payments (e.g., lottery winnings) statistically significantly reduce the probability of bankruptcy in the first two years after winning, however, this reduction is followed by a statistically significant increase in the probability of bankruptcy of similar magnitude three to five years after winning. Note that this study only considered lump-sum winnings up to $150,000; I have not found any studies that track bankruptcies of larger cash payouts. I suspect this is due to the relatively small amount of data available on the large jackpot winners. Update: I read the abstracts of all of the articles cited by the Hankins/Hoekstra/Skiba paper, and none of them seem to specifically study bankruptcy frequency among lottery winners. One interesting theory arose from a paper by Thaler: He points out that one of the best predictors for one's level of consumption (i.e., spending) is one's income. Therefore, if one's income suddenly spikes due to a lump-sum lottery windfall, one might be very likely to increase one's spending, possibly taking on significant liabilities. The problem is: A lottery payout is only temporary, so once that money runs out one is unable to pay off one's debts. 

Did snow actually fall on the Reagan, and if so, how much? Was there enough for "snowball fights", or is this a mix of a lawyer's statement, severely misinterpreted photo, and fear of the invisible? 

While I would expect this number to be large, that seems extreme. I'm guessing it's padded by including sub(-sub-sub...)contractors, but even then, how pervasive is the spending of the DoD? 

CinemaSins often points out as a sin movies that 'instantly make themselves unavailable for in-flight viewing due to plane-crash sequence' (e.g. Fight Club). Is this true; are there guidelines that major carriers follow for entertainment selection? Are depicted incidents with private craft (e.g. a Cessna) OK? 

I was watching an interview with Spolsky and he mentioned some study that showed listening to music with headphones caused a drop in having "deep thoughts" $URL$ I can't find this anywhere; what was the study and where can I find it? 

The article attributes the high cost of the California state prison system to their prison guard union bargaining for some of the highest salaries in the nation, along with NJ ("The highest-paid prison guards in the nation (we battle it out with New Jersey)...") The figure looks like it came from the California Legislative Analyst's Office which has a rough break-down of: 

One of the commonly cited reasons for the ratcheting of defense spending in the United States is that it's an easily justifiable kickback (tugging on patriotic heart strings) to representatives' districts. A recent Howard Dean opinion piece has him claiming that: 

The answer is that, although there seems to be an association there is no clear scientific proof for it. Source: Adult and childhood leukemia near a high-power radio station in Rome, Italy. - Michelozzi, Am J Epidemiol, 2002 (bold is mine) 

This is a tricky question to answer, the main problem being that "inflammatory diseases" is one of those buzz-words that includes a vast and diverse range of illnesses. For any type of claim at this regard to be at least meaningful very precise distinctions have to be made and extreme care has to be made before doing any generalization (i.e.: if a compound helps relieving symptoms of arthritis, this does not imply it will help for inflammatory bowel syndrome). In summary: there seems to be a possible acute effect of Ï‰3 PUFA on certain inflammatory situations. Evidence of prevention of inflammatory diseases is scarce at least. In certain cases such as prostate cancer certain PUFA may however be a risk factor. Further studies are warranted before being able to give a precise answer on this. 

Now, although Simoncini's theory is pseudoscience, this does not mean that sodium bicarbonate could not have an effect on cancer. There has been some scientific research on the effect of bicarbonate on tumours. Due to their high metabolic rate tumours are, in fact, acidic (pH ~6.5 compared to ~7.2 in normal tissue), and bicarbonate can act by increasing the pH in the tumoral environment. This could be important because low pH seems to be an important factor in chemoresistance and could have some effect in promoting metastases. This study shows an important effect of bicarbonate in preventing metastases in a mouse model of breast cancer: Bicarbonate increases tumor pH and inhibits spontaneous metastases - Robey et al. - Cancer Res., 2009 However, the authors warn that: 

I've seen many articles online that talk about radioactive snow falling on the Reagan after the Tohoku tsunami and Fukushima disaster, from the NY Post and shakier sources like Liberty Voice. TYT had a newspiece on it as well, which sounded like it was thinly sourced from an article like the aforementioned (of which there are many clones). The picture often associated is of "sailors cleaning snow off the deck", because I guess white stuff is snow (like cancer and fungus), despite it looking suspiciously like foam. 

I'm not sure where the article's Stanford tuition fee comes from, the raw tuition is $15,777/quarter (3 quarters/year), after room, board, and other fees (variable) other sites cite it at about $64k ($URL$ I don't quite know how to compare the two, but I bet security isn't proportionally as high for a university than a prison. American students 26 years old or younger can also remain on their parent's insurance plan, so that cost isn't included. Also bear in mind that universities like Stanford have many other funding streams, such as government research grants and endowments. For FY'16, Stanford reported "Student Income" as only 15% of its operating revenue. They receive $1.3 billion in research funding from the federal government, so across 16k students that works out to about another $80k per student, or including the 14k staff, $43k per person. 

The Microsoft Kinect uses an IR source (laser or just diode?) to project a pattern in order to get 3D data on what it's looking at. As low-power IR is invisible and intangible, many people have concern about it, implicating it when they feel a sensation in their eyes (e.g. a feeling like eye strain), and some claim to have measured the output to be vastly higher than permitted. Has the Kinect IR source been soundly implicated to cause any sorts of health problems, or has it been measured to output more than permitted by applicable regulatory bodies?
