Put your gears to 1:1 position. This is the safest position to start with the optimum cable tension. Also, you will have less chances of messing things up. loosen the joint that is holding the derailleur cable for the front derailleur clutch. This is actually located near where your cassettes are (gear coggs). Clean the clutch joints and housings properly. If you have a thin-brissled brush, it is good. Otherwise, use a cleaning cloth. Clean as thoroughly as possible and make sure all the debris and small granules are not blocking any of the intersections/joints. Tighten the cable back in the joint, ideally and exactly where it was before. Check the up/down shifts for all the gear to ensure that you have got the correct tension level. 

I think I found the solution. I lost my cable crimps and need to fix it probably by duct taping it and also using anti-fray caps. 

My bike is only 7 months old, but the front derailleur cable fibres are becoming loose i.e. the individual thin metal fibres twised together to form the cable are loosing out. I think I have lost the metal cap which was holding the twisted end of the cable so that those fibres stay twisted. How can I fix this? Could anyone suggest? TA 

I would suggest that you strap it to your back ONLY if it is not distracting you when cycling. What I mean by distracting is the back sliding left or right and making you feel that it is moving around your body. This could be an annoying factor for just anybody. If you have this issue, try to fasten it around the protective rail at the front. Citi bikes are reasonably sturdy, so the weight distribution would not be affected I hope. We have similar bikes in London and I am sure I have seen people doing both; bags strapped around the body and fastened securely around the front area (where the protective rail is). Why not just try it? I would certainly do that. P.S. Make sure you secure it properly if placed around the protective rails at the front. You don't want your bag to be accidentally slipping away on a main road during rush hour, especially if you have a laptop or PDA inside :P 

My mother is 60+ years old and 200+ lbs. She never learned to ride a bicycle, so she rides a Schwinn Town & Country adult tricycle. She loves it and rides it everyday, 2-5 miles everyday. The spokes on the rear right wheel keep breaking. In the past year, since she's had the trike, she must have had 5-10 spokes replaced. The right wheel is also the "Drive" wheel, and the only wheel giving her problems. Could it be a shoddy wheel? a bad wheel builder? What could be done to fix this? Stronger spokes? Replace the whole wheel for a new one? I need help and I'm officially out of ideas... 

I'm speaking from personal experience here. Looking at the bicycle from the back. The drive train is on the right side, and when you use the kickstand it leans to the left. When I commute to work, I tend to put my messenger bag with rear rack attachments on the left side. Mostly because the bike is already leaning that way. Once, when I was getting ready to leave work. I placed the bag on the right, and proceed to begin to tie my pants so they wouldn't get caught in the chain. The whole bike, bag and all, fell right on top of me. The incline of that particular part of the parking lot and the weight of the bag were enough to throw the whole bike of balance and rendered the kickstand useless. Since then, I've always put my bag on the left side. The idea of my bike falling on the right side and bending or breaking a derailleur just freaks me out since I've yet to learn how to fix them or adjust them. 

FUTURE REFERENCE: Depending on how heavy your ride schedule is, you should do it ideally every 4 months or so. In this way, you keep your bike in good condition as well as the safety. You don't want to be in the middle of the traffic and bashing your head wondering why your gear is not shifting down :p I hope this helps. 

IF YOU ARE CYCLING ON A ROAD THAT HAS OMNI-DIRECTIONAL FLOW OF TRAFFIC You should simply signal to turn right if you need to or just carry on going forward. If the right-hand turn is into a road with bi-directional traffic flow, watch for any cars approaching from the right when you going straight forward. IF YOU ARE CYCLING ON A ROAD THAT HAS BI-DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC FLOW Same as before; signal right (if you want to turn right) or keep going forward. Also, keep an eye on the oncoming or waiting traffic at the junctions. A common factor in both cases is watching behind your left-shoulder to check for any oncoming traffic before changing lanes or making turns. This is a good gesture and pays off. What you must remember is that unless approaching a junction-turn to left, you should never position yourself unnecessarily in the left-hand lane as it may block heavy traffic flow from behind (car drivers may curse you and honk). Please stay on the rightmost side of your road (without hitting pedestrians yourself on the kerb) so that the cars can simply overtake you gently. This is exactly what we do in the UK (only on the LH-side). I hope this helps. You can find lots of videos on YouTube that may help you envisage your actions more practically. 

I currently have a Shimano 5700 10 speed double 53-39 t crankset with BCD of 130 mm ($URL$ Can I change to a Shimano 110 mm BCD cranks of 53-39 t ($URL$ That's 11 speed but I don't think that will matter. The reason to change is I want to try a 165 mm length crank instead of 170 mm on current. 

Got a brand new shimano 105 FD double. I put the chain on the small ring and when I adjust the limit screw the cage can't go towards the frame enough so that the chain can't go to the largest rear cog because of the cage stop it from moving further to the frame. Then I started inspecting the FD and found the cage won't move a bit at all. To prove it I removed the two limit screws and tried to move the cage by hand and it just won't move. I don't have experience in it but watched many videos on YouTube and saw people moving the cage easily by hand to adjust FD. So wondering if there is something wrong with my FD? Update: The FD is fine, the problem is my FD hanger is extending a little bit too much from the seat post which makes the FD too far away from the frame. And my chain and cassette is 9 speed, and the FD is 10 speed so the FD cage a little bit tight here for a 9 speed chain. I googled a lot and found a solution is to use a 8 speed FD, which got much bigger size cage and can move further to the frame somehow. This plus a one mm BB spacer on the drive side solve the problem. I was not sure where was the problem at first so thought it might be the problem of FD itself, but it's just not compatible.
