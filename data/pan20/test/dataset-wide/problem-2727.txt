Genesis describes a creation account. It can be argued that as author does not provide complete description of the creation and just quickly mentions them, he might be using terms to condense his views in small paras. It may be a simple account of a complex thing. God, has attributes that do not seem to simplify things. God may be used in some instances to simplify explanations (like in a teleological argument of sort) but in Bible he is not always presented as such. 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Are you the one of whom I spoke in former days through My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days for many years that I would bring you against them? (Ezekiel 38:17) Here God is not being used to explain or account an event that can happen without him. The main thing to notice is that author is not using God to explain an event but God apparently talks to Gog, and tells him that he is the one who has been prophesied by his will. Genesis is poetic according to some, a form of Hebrew Parallelism. God is not used in many contexts as a poetic aid. Considering God as a metaphor means that not only God is a metaphor but sacrifice of Jesus, story of Abraham and Job, and probably whole account of twelve apostles is a metaphor. But of what? It is surprising that author does not clear that anywhere. It is a metaphor that "metaphorises" something that is not known. Didn't early Christians who faced persecution know that the God is just a metaphor? If they didn't think that God was metaphor (because they faced a lot for him), it means either authors were unsuccessful in delivering their thoughts properly or wanted to troll people deliberately. There were several authors from different time periods and if they felt that people were getting wrong impression, why didn't they correct it later on? And the troll part is rather a stretch to believe. Some would say that it is essential to believe in God to be a "Christian" but not in truth of creation account. To believe people erred on fundamental belief is less obvious than to believe it was a lie. The Bible loses its whole purpose if God is considered a metaphor, many events lose importance. Like why Jew accused him of blasphemy and wanted to stone him? Was Jesus claiming to be a metaphor, nature or Universe? 

You can make a mistake in first premise or second. Either that can be because you do not know exceptions (ignorance) or you end up believing something to be true/dominant when it is not (bias). Other than that, you can make an honest mistake or make a wrong conclusion by justifying what you know or think to be true from current knowledge/belief. It is mostly a combination of these factors. Consider that in earlier times people believed in miasma theory. You can call it ignorance but it was partly true. There had to be a reason why people who were otherwise healthy would fell to diseases. As air could be felt but germs could neither be felt nor seen, the culprit was decided. It was a result of both ignorance and justification by current knowledge/belief. 

If Apple sells Iphone 6s, then unless proven otherwise, we should believe that Moon is made of cheese. Apple sells Iphone 6s. It is not proven that Moon is not made of cheese. Hence, we should believe that Moon is made of cheese. 

It does not seem to be as the argument relies on a person giving respect to this "natural heritage" or the process of evolution. But as the person who is committing suicide, thinks that the world is unfair (at least to him), there is no reason for him to offer respect to "natural heritage". Indeed by killing himself, he is actually freeing himself from being used/abused by these processes (consider a person who is thinking of suicide because of a failed marriage has enough reasons to blame evolution, at least partly, for example, for making him not good enough, for presence of hypergamy, or even the psychological processes which make him feel need love, or develop attachment, just so that he produces next generation). Actually, the idea that "we are all replicators" is anything but motivational and undermines humans, as they are reduced to just means to an end game of survival of species, which is not false from a purely naturalistic, evolutionary perspective. Any 'is' argument is thus, incapable of convincing him as it 'is' also true that he can kill himself, and offers no reason why he should not exercise his will against the designs of a world, which he perceives has been unfair to him. This is somewhat similar to "existential crisis'. 'We exist to be here' is also not a good argument, as if the man chooses to die, then maybe, he was meant to. It cuts both ways, and just looks like a fatalist argument. 

Kant's moral theory depends on there being an objective (end) and an action to fulfill it. Kant's first maxim flows from universality - 

As far as I know you are correct in thinking that established academic philosophers don't take non-Abrahamic Western religions in general and neopagan religions in particular seriously. Some religion fare better than other. However as you yourself show (by stats on Buddhism and Hinduism), some major eastern religions are do considered. There might be quite a few reasons why neo-pagans are not taken seriously - 1) Neo Paganism is actually a newer phenonmenon that claims to derive from earlier historical pagan beliefs. This means that a set of beliefs that was lost was given life by entirely different people, much later, who only developed their beliefs from the texts and other sources. The lack of continuity and tradition raises severe questions as to whether neo-pagans are actually following the same religion they claim to derive from. 2) Major religions that exist today are dependent on either a miraculous event or a person that is said to have possessed some supernatural powers or divine revelation. With Neo Paganism, the question of origin is simply not a question. Without an authoritative figure, they are rendered too plastic, and neo Pagans differ on many issues. Hence it is difficult to determine whether the beliefs that neo Pagan holds are a result of that person's prior beliefs or beliefs or experiences that he gained from Neo Paganism. 3) One feature of Neo Pagans that seem to unite them somewhat is that they believe in some sort of magic. The important point is that, as magic and rituals can alter reality, or are claimed generally, they can be actually tested. Hence such a religion can be proved by an actual test and thus is not of much significance in philosophical discussions, as a person who want to establish validity of that religion can actually demonstrate that by experiment. 4) The "core" beliefs and ideas of Neo Pagans are actually discussed (or have been discussed) by philosophers. Collective Consciousness, Idealism, are taken somewhat seriously. However they have are neither completely Neo Pagan beliefs nor they have necessarily been looked into because of Paganism. Hence some interesting parts of Neo Paganism are discussed but under other contexts. and 4. I do not think that Neo Pagans do present their beliefs in such a manner as can be critiqued by philosophers, or are interesting to them. However some philosophies that share some properties with Neo Pagan beliefs are considered. 

Free will is possible in our world. This is mostly related to religion/spirituality but not entirely. This is not just because it is a consequence of religious/spiritual views of world in most cases (though it is a consequence but that is not the only reason people believe in its existence) but actually opposite is also true in some cases. If it is true that our will is essentially deterministic then - Suppose I think that our reasoning is entirely determined. Hence it is also true it was determined that I would think that the previous and this very statement I am writing was predetermined by causes with no intentionality and purpose and intelligence. Hence I have reasons to doubt that whether such process is presenting truth (what is) to me. But now I'm doubting truth expressed in my very first statement. If this is also determined, then what reasons I have to consider that the process produced truth first time and falsehood next time, apart from my initial assumption. The very fact that people think they could have chosen differently makes them think that free will exists. A deterministic AI can never choose differently in similar circumstances. Can people do that? Turing tests are of no help here. 

Intelligible means able to be understood.To understand a particular being, you have to understand both its existence and essence, for that is what makes it different from other beings. For eg., a horse is different from boar because of different properties (essence) and is different from an imaginary horse because of its existence. Now, what is meant by understanding something? It means to have reasons why is something the way it is, and not the other way (which reflects Correspondence Theory of Truth). That is however, what we mean by explanation, for explanation means justification, and justification is an act of showing (via reasoning) why something is the way it is, and not the other way. 

Most philosophies assume one (or more) primal form of something, one of whose property is "existence". That thing(s) is(are) eternal or better uncaused. Rest of the things come into being when the rearrangement of that primal form (or derivatives thereof) into something that fulfills the definition of that thing. Like a fruit may come into being by transformation of a flower when the rearrangement of the constituents of the flower, lead to a thing that fits the definition of a fruit. The other way to look at it is to argue that "existence" itself always exists (for it is existence) and lends itself to other things so that they start existing. 

If an event or object is difficult to be described in normal words, that might be a good candidate for metaphor. For example, ice pick headaches. It can be checked whether the piece of text has been imbibed with some sort of poetic feel. Simple running sentences that are focused less on conveying of emotions, more on facts are often devoid of any imagery or literary device for the simple reason that author does not write those texts for enjoyment of reader but for passing on information. Both context and purpose are important tools for this distinction. For example, his soul was captured in the painting will probably be a metaphorical text, if appearing in a book of fiction, but a fact or factual claim if appearing in a book by a paranormal investigator. Similarly, his soul was captured in the painting, the colours aptly showing the suffering of a man, witness and victim of depravity of life is clearly a metaphor-laden attempt. Terseness, parallelism and imagery are indicators of a poetry or poetic prose. There are some objects that are specifically associated with certain properties such that either they uniquely identify those properties or properties uniquely identify them. These metaphors can also be identified by the culture and the imagery strong at the point of time of writing. This is because when an author writes a metaphorical statement, he intends that readers know the association and grasp the imagery. For example, I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life". Important thing to notice is that often the object being "metaphorised" is vastly different than the object it is being "metaphorised" into, so it can be easily seen that comparison is not a factual claim. This is perhaps hardest to distinguish. A piece of text may be written exclusively to set up a ground for the subsequent text (which not may be immediately subsequent). The aim is to draw a parallelism or analogy. Example may be the story of Abraham and Isaac. Parallelism can be identified if the two stories have a similarity (hidden or conspicuous) that is striking, appealing and suggestive of a parallel. Also if a piece of text is directly lifted off from one place and applied to another, then if it appears to have a deeper meaning and relates two portions, it might be a metaphor (analogy or parallel). 

No. The hypothesis of "infinite universes" is an attempt to solve an entirely different problem, which is "why some quantities and laws take specific values and form, that we observe". The answer proposed is a mixture of infinite universes (as there are potentially infinite possible real numbers and infinite possible forms) and Weak Anthropic Principle. "How scientific laws are grounded" is an entirely different question, which asks why/how these laws exist (or rather, why/how objects in our Universe follow these laws), and not why these laws are like they are. There is a difference of emphasis. Descartes wanted to answer questions like - 

As metaphor has some distinct qualities, not everything has an equal chance of being a metaphor. The text thus can be analysed in a following manner, in my opinion - 

I am surprised as to how the answers are about whether the argument (for God as first cause) is convincing, rather than whether it commits special pleading. No, the argument does not commit special pleading. Special pleading is a form of fallacious argument that involves an attempt to cite something as an exception to a generally accepted rule, principle, etc. without justifying the exception. This is not special pleading as both sides to the argument concede that God, if he exists, is different from the Universe and material objects therein, for the discussion is about some form of a spiritual entity. The objection is akin to arguing that if humans cannot regenerate their limbs, we should assume that Namekians (a race of green humanoids in Dragon Ball) cannot regenerate their limbs too. 

It is a question that pits two different principles against each other. For that you must ask whether there is a difference between value of life of an animal "commonly found" and one that is "rare". There can be two types of arguments that can be made to support saving an "endangered" animal over a "non-endangered" animal. One is from a pragmatic perspective that the extinction of a species negatively affects us (deteriorate delicate balance of nature, disturbs food chain, some species may contribute in development of medicines etc.). The other factor to be considered is just "aesthetics"- We won't get to see the animal again, animals are cute etc. Leaving pragmatism aside, as it would involve arguments beyond the scope of this forum, and be heavily dependent on animal under discussion, the question becomes whether aesthetics have any more value than life. If one agrees that it was not wrong to kill the animal to save child, if it was not endangered, then the reason he most probably is in doubt about the issue is because he is considering aesthetics (or pragmatism) to be almost of same order of value as human life. Now let us consider some moral frameworks. As the saving of an "endangered species" will be more beneficial to state (debatable) hence in State Utilitarianism, it is right to save the animal. In Ethical Egoism, zoo keepers should do what is best for them, and I think, that would probably be killing of animal, unless it is very costly to replace it (opportunity cost comes into play). In Utilitarianism, the decision would be based on what will make people happy most. However as in Kantian Utilitarianism, people are not to be treated as means, it could be argued that child should be saved. In all, it means that it depends. The main point is that you are not comparing two lives, but an aesthetic (if no other significant benefits are there) to a life. 

If the metaphor contradicts the belief of early propagators, believers, authorities on that matter, then probably the statement in question is a fact. If what is considered to be a metaphor is used widely in other contexts where the metaphor-justification does not apply and also in different text and writing styles, it probably is a fact because metaphor is used for special purposes and not common usage. If a statement has no purpose except to act as statement of fact and does not relate to anything else, then probably it along with object it talks about is not a metaphor. This is because that statement has no hidden meaning nor any poetic utility that justifies usage of a metaphor. 

The question is a tough one because it is very hard to know what Camus had in his mind while writing that. Many interpretations are possible. However, there is one way to look into it. Camus starts from presupposition that life is absurd and meaningless. This is important to remember. Camus also considers the philosophers that mitigate or eliminate the absurdity by turning to other concepts as having failed in the task - the task of presenting an absurdist's actual point of view accurately. The moment you try to somehow answer to life's absurdity (which according to Camus is a conflict between reason and unreasonable) by abandoning or elevating reason, you have just compromised on the absurdist's position/feelings. Sisyphus represents thus an ideal absurdist - one that has not failed like others. This is because he knows that he will never fulfill his goal and he accepts that. Thus, he is content - in a sense that he knows there is no life that is better than his that he should aspire because that is not possible (just like it is not possible for humans to have a better life though they might have more options than Sisyphus). However, according to Camus, after acceptance of the absurdity (that absurdity exists), it is important to live it without abandoning it and falling in some kind of hope. Sisyphus does that. And, that makes him happy. Sisyphus is happy because he has conquered his fate - not by changing it, but by accepting it and yet revolting against it. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn. He is not saddened by lack of meaning and hence he is happy because he realises that. Now, for answer to latter part of your question, consider the chain of events. A man who realises that there is absurdity in life, that there is a conflict between what he thinks to be rational (should be) and how the world is, is saddened by this knowledge. What Camus offers is a solution that arises from making peace with fate (with disdain). A man must accept that the world is unreasonable and that he looks for reason and thus there will always be a conflict between the two. Now, when he accepts that, he is no longer sad. Because the only reason (in this context) for unhappiness is removed, a man is now happy. Here, I must give you an example - You work in a 9 to 5 job and are happy. Suddenly you suffer the crisis that Camus is talking about. You realise that all this is meaningless. Getting up, going to office, succeeding some times and failing other times, coming back home, spending time with wife and children, going back to sleep, waking up next day again and so on. This realisation makes you sad. If somehow that sadness will be removed, you will be happy once again. If Sisyphus dislikes pushing rocks, he will be never happy with it. But, if he is sad just because he knows he will never make it to the top, then if this only reason for his unhappiness is taken care of, he will be happy again.
