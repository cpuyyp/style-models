You could probably think about the policy trilemma. It's the idea that a country can only have up to two of the following: free capital flow, a fixed exchange rate, and independent monetary policy. Right now it seems that Venezuela wants a stable currency exchange (so they control it) and they want reserve currency available to stabilize the economy if need be and have independent monetary policy. So if you got rid of currency exchange controls so people could buy foreign currency more readily, in the short run, you'd lose control of the exchange rate without gaining anything. Long term, since the money market is clearing, and assuming Walras' Law holds, then capital will be able to flow more freely and contribute to economic growth. It might force Venezuela to be serious about not causing hyperinflation for that to happen that. 

So here's a few ideas that have been floating around my head since undergraduate university. It seems that money owned by the highest net wealth owners is always moving around and making a return, but only in markets that don't particularly affect the lower classes (debt and equity trading for example). So might there be significantly different rates of inflation or expected rates of inflation for different income groups? As income inequality rises, would money demand also be lower for lower income groups and higher for high income groups, which would create inflation for luxury goods and such? If a central bank cares about population welfare and they know their policy may impact inflation differently for different income groups, couldn't this affect their planning/optimal policy? I know these are a lot of questions. I am mainly interested in whether there have been studies or theories about any of these sorts of questions before and whether these questions are actually interesting, empirically. Feel free to give me suggestions on how to hone in this post; it's a lot of speculative questions, I know. Edit: Otherwise, how might you guys approach this problem? How might you guys and gals try to model inflation for different income groups? 

I am currently reading this article. If you are unfamiliar with the game, "The Price is Right", at the beginning, four bidders are selected who have to guess the price of some consumer object. Whoever gets closest to the retail value (rounded to the dollar) without going over goes on to play a different pricing game. Play is sequential, so you can imagine bidding last provides an advantage. This article is studying whether or not players behave rationally in this first part of the game, or whether it is bounded by some simpler decision rule. The paper has a proposition: 

Consider it intuitively. If each agent is paid the marginal product of what they contribute, then supposedly, the firm will also provide some value to a good or service that they will find a return on. For someone like taxi cab drivers, they probably contribute most of the value of the service, (and pay for their own gas, upkeep, etc.). They end up getting paid close to the full value of the service, while the firm collects rents other ways. But if you are a car salesman, when you make a sale, you don't get paid the full value of the car that you sell. That's because sure, your labor contributed to the value of the sale, but so did the people keeping up the floor room, the advertising, etc. So everyone contributes some value to the firm, and presumably the firm itself will do so. The firm in this case may have put up financing for the dealership and taken on the cost of sifting through the labor market. So presumably the individuals in the firm will receive "profits" for these efforts as well. Keep in mind that when we talk about zero economic profit in neoclassical economics, this does not preclude accounting profits. 

At the optimal values, by duality, this Lagrangian problem is equivalent to maximizing mean score given a time budget, where $t_1 + t_2 = 46$ $$m = \max_{t_1, t_2} \frac{[{g}_{1}({t}_{1})+{g}_{2}({t}_{2})]}{2} - \lambda(t_1 + t_2 - 46) $$ Plug in the optimal values of $t_1, t_2$ into your original Lagrangian: $$V(m) = 46 + \lambda(m - 70)$$ Note that $$\frac{\partial V}{\partial m} = \lambda$$ I think the interpretation here is that the Lagrange multiplier is the rate of change of the optimal score as you gain more time. 

The above implies that $\exists \ p$ s.t. $\forall x,y$, then $x \succcurlyeq y \iff U(x) \geq U(y)$ This we have utility function representation, by definition. It is a basic proof from the beginning of your class probably that representation implies rationality. We can also say if $U(x)$ is continuous in $X$ and $U(x)$ represents $\succcurlyeq$ on $X$, this implies the preferences are continuous. $x \succcurlyeq y \iff p \cdot x \geq p \cdot y \iff p \cdot (x + z) \geq p \cdot (y + z) \iff x + z \succcurlyeq y + z \quad \forall x,y,z \in X$ So that shows additivity. Now suppose monotonicity does not hold. Suppose $x \succcurlyeq y \implies p \cdot x \geq p \cdot y$ but additionally, $x < y$ $\implies p \cdot x < p \cdot y$ which is a contradiction. Suppose non-triviality does not hold. Suppose $x \sim y \ \forall \ x, y$, where $x \neq y$, so $x$ and $y$ are unique. But we have monotonicity now. but $x > y \iff x \succ y$ and $y > x \iff y \succ x$ 

Gary Becker's work on Social Demand probably has something to do with the phenonmena. Becker basically asked why some popular places consistently seemed to underprice their goods. For example, concerts often sell out very quickly and fancy restaurants in the middle of a busy suburb might be often crowded. These venues could raise their prices, but the basic idea is that the demand for a good may not be independent of other agents' demands. So demand may be dependent on how much other people also demand the good; you might enjoy going out to eat at somewhere that always seems popular than somewhere that gets less traffic, or you might beg your mom that you just have to go to that popular concert by [insert cool band here], specifically because all your other friends are going. Additionally, social places like restaurants and concerts often have customers who usually or only go in groups, so you could see how that would incentivize fiercer competition among these venues. 

I have somehow managed to get myself stuck on the last part of this proof it seems. I am not using the fact that this set is a hyperplane and that hyperplanes are $n-1$ dimensions of the space they are in. It is easy to show that $\{x_1, \cdots x_n\}$ spans the set we are considering, since $\sum p \cdot x$ is a linear combination and all that. However, $x_n$ can be expressed as a linear combination of $\{x_1 \cdots x_{n-1}\}$: $$x_n = \frac{I - (p_1x_1 + \cdots p_{n-1}x_{n-1})}{p_n}$$ So we can remove $x_n$ from the span and the resulting set still spans. Now we want to show $\{x_1, \cdots n_{n-1}\}$ are linearly independent. That is, if $p_1x_1 + \cdots p_{n-1}x_{n-1} = 0$, all $p_i = 0$. If the set is spanning and linearly independent, then it is a basis. Since it would have $n-1$ vectors, it would be of dimension $n-1$ and we'd be done. So I note that $p_1x_1 + \cdots + p_{n-1}x_{n-1} = I - p_nx_n$, and that $I > 0$. So I assume there is a case where $I - p_nx_n = 0$ and where $I - p_nx_n \neq 0$. I am not sure how to finish off this proof, which makes me sad, because I think I'm just missing something obvious. Any assistance would be appreciated. 

Here was my attempt at a proof: First let us look at the "if" case. Assume $\succcurlyeq$ on $X$ is rational, continuous, additive, monotonic, and non-trivial. BUT Case 1: $x \succcurlyeq y$ and $p \cdot x < p \cdot y \ \forall p$ Suppose $p = \{\frac{1}{s} \cdots \frac{1}{s}\}$ $$p \cdot x < p \cdot y \implies \frac{1}{s} \sum^s_{i=1} x_i < \frac{1}{s} \sum^s_{i=1} y_i \implies \sum^s_{i=1} x_i < \sum^s_{i=1} y_i$$ So $x \succcurlyeq y \iff x \geq y$ by monotonicity $x \geq y \iff x_i \geq y_i \ \forall i$ by definition but then $\sum^s_{i=1} x_i \geq \sum^s_{i=1} y_i$ which is a contradiction.
