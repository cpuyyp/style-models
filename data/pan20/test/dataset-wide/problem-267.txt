If only simple questions are answered, the situation is not significantly different from today, where information of quality exist and is accessible. Only the cost (in time) and the scale would change. Not more than today will people stop to believe whatever they wish be the truth (even when proven false) : homeopathy, god, little green men in the White Office, etc. People may rely on this more and more over time and, like mentioned, get rid of doing the basic reasoning by themselves. In the past, tools replaced muscular force, machines replaced repetitive labor, computers started doing arithmetic. There is no need such creation will not replace basic reasoning. What is interesting is that even the question states that this will make us less capable, which sounds biased. At different point in time, the same was said for the fire that make us weak and less capable of resisting cold, for the tools that reduced our muscular mass, and of course for machines and computers. Is that bad ? Or is that only our fear speaking ? Maybe such change will open a new era where mankind will free itself from basic activities and reach another step in its evolution, like for example a global consciousness, or full understanding of reality. No opinion here, but the simple remark that we see this through the lens of the present. 

Answer is, as most often is the case with "what if" questions, complicated. But in short it can be said: no problem understanding the theory, Replicating the machinery is a different matter. Simple steam engine was known in 1st Century AD - look up - and Romans had excellent understanding of parts of hydrodynamics - dams, pipes, aqueducts, pumps. So they would have no problems grasping the concept. But building a working engine requires more than just knowledge. I would say that it's possible to build very simple steam engine using Roman tech, but it would be very heavy and unreliable. As sphennings points out it requires high quality of metal alloy and a degree of precision manufacture not available to Roman tech base. I believe they would quickly found out that and after maybe several decades (on the fast end) to maybe a century at least (on the slow end) to be able to produce stable output. But the issue is not the tech, but the culture. Romans were uninterested in such things simply because they had enormous excess of power (slavery). Steam engine gained in popularity after it became light and small enough to build locomotive, for example, thus Romans would not have any use for their version. You would have to put this "discovery" in proper context (warship, i.e. ironclad maybe?). Industrial revolution in England began as a attempt to address the labor shortage that plagued (no pun intended) the Europe since.. well, the plague. Add wars (most notably the 100-years war, 30 Years War and 1000 Years Muslim Invasion) and the labor shortages are a fact of life until end of 19th century. In fact, the wars were mainly why the Europe was so poor for so long, as they sucked away lives needed to improve livelihood across the continent. What Roman need would a steam engine address? Most of the Roman trade is water-borne. Mediterranean is rather small sea, there is no economic nor political reason to invest huge capital to shorten the travel times by half - it sounds impressive until you realize that it means 3 days from Alexandria to rome instead of 7 or so (admit, I'm guessing here), and there are huge grain ships plying this route already. Sail ships, cheapest possible type. Rome-Londinium route? Again - current tech is enough and speed is not economically explainable. Raw materials needed to equip Roman legions and address needs of the population are there in sufficient numbers... The only way to improve average roman life is to increase supply of raw materials, but there is no way to do it. Last thing - for widespread use of steam engine supply of coal is needed. Wood is not good source of fuel. 

In a nutshell, what are the pre-requisites for having sailing ships fire nuclear cannonballs? The setting is entirely alternate-universe, so the available material can be a lot more naturally "primed" for military use, but not so much as to create a high likelihood of a nuclear natural disaster. Also, a running theme of the entire setting is that (conventional) explosive devices were invented very early (by cavepeople, essentially) and have ever since been culturally shrouded in occult/"alchemical" theories, so the preferable path for developing tactical nukes would be an accidental success amid a mass of pseudo-science. Eventually, nuclear weapons would be banned around the time steampower is common, so they never get as far as strategic nukes. 

Energy is energy, but the origin matters. Kinetic energy of a projectile comes from somewhere, that is: there needs to be energy expenditure in the first place. However, in contrast to projectiles laser cannot be easily deflected nor absorbed. Plasma energy is much harder to achieve, and is - at least theoretically - much easier to defend against (simplifying: strong enough e-m shield can dissipate it). SO in conclusion: d.e.w. actually needs only reliable high-capacity power storage to be technologically viable as of now. And, thinking on it, if one wants to trade some of the combat readiness time for power levels, capacitors+batteries setup is possible even now for something reasonable. Kilowatt laser (equivalent to roughly 2x45.ACP)? There are capacitors now available allowing for 8 shots, in the size of two shotgun shells and weighing much less than that (I know; simplification). 

If you consider a radio signal as the electromagnetic spectrum, then you already have an answer with "visible" light. What human perceive through our eyes is nothing more than a specific range of the spectrum, the one the sun emits light in. Other species are able to perceive outside the human range : bees see in the ultraviolet range to spot flowers, and some predators can see in the infrared. So you can imagine evolution that led to other wavelengths use if it give an advantage (being social is an advantage). On the emitter part, bio-luminescence exist. You can imagine other chemical or physical reactions to emit in other ranges. Storing specific isotopes and releasing small amounts of them, or maybe moving iron organs to generate magnetic fields. Note that torpedoes and other fishes have the ability to deliver electric shocks. Such organs could be suitable for lighter electric emissions as well. 

What would be the best way to send energy that is generated outside the Earth's atmosphere, possibly in the asteroid belt (nevermind the means), so that it can be used on the surface of the planet? Let's say solar power generation. With enough mirrors you can get really high output. The energy thus "gathered" can be "transmitted" down to Earth's surface, but it will be, in essence, a laser beam (i know, it will be concentrated sunlight, but I mean effect, not the naming details), that will be dangerous to anything in it's path, including the atmosphere. Assuming level tech of today but include current experiments in all stages of advance, what would be the best - that means safest, cheapest and most efficient - way to supply energy to the grid on the Earth's surface? Additionally: what would be the upper limit of the power levels to be transmitted? To clarify after some very good comments: 

I don't know if you'd care to hear a nationalist's input on the subject, but here goes. First of all, the principal objection to pacifism applies here: either everyone becomes a pacifist at once, or the non-pacifists win without contest. Similarly, you will have to put a lot of resources and effort (and by "effort" I mean a degree of ideological coercion that will sometimes appear controversial to say the least) not only into initially establishing your nationless world, but also into maintaining it. A world like that won't run itself without constantly trying to spiral back to its original state. And the catalysts for neo-nationalism will come from two opposite ends of the spectrum: on the one hand, those who straight-up refuse to be affected by the ideology; and on the other hand, those who create a narrative successfully rationalising effective nationalism while seemingly not contradicting the ideology. And a single pocket of nationalism is enough for a domino effect combining opposition and imitation. Secondly, I have doubts about your "lack of education" hypothesis, and those doubts stem from my personal experience. My multicultural, multi-lingual education, and the corresponding general environment of my formative years, is what eventually made me a nationalist; it's not something I would have contemplated earlier. It's not that it was a negative experience — it wasn't; it's not that I have a problem being equally cordial and tolerant to everyone; but I discovered at some point that my national identity is a core part of who I am, and there's little I could or would want to do about it. No offence, but "human" is just a bland thing to be — unless and until we're invaded by space aliens. In fact, not necessarily invaded; contact would be enough. For now, being human is just a trivial given, and you can't make it into anything greater than that without artificial indoctrination that's as intrusive as it is brittle. A nation is basically a super-extended family. Very few people would believe that their parents, spouse, or child are literally better than anyone else in the world; but the vast majority of people certainly feels this way. Or to be more precise: most people would enjoy the occasions when reality accidentally seems to confirm this illusion of superiority (which most people would recognise for an illusion even if they don't admit it, which however does nothing to dispel it). Then again, like I said, this is the ultimate extended family, and as such, it's virtually guaranteed to include people you dislike and don't particularly respect, but whom you nonetheless continue to think of as your kin, and to whom you would accordingly extend some degree of preferential treatment. Now I do agree that this model is dysfunctional on many levels, but would abolishing families really accomplish anything? Not to mention that it would certainly be dishonest to reduce all family ties to "hating" other families — even though we have Romeo and Juliet and a myriad of lesser dramas playing out in our everyday life. Admittedly, in an urbanised society, the importance of familial identity has faded a lot; it's worth to note that this happened without any guidance — what's more, in spite of numerous attempts to reaffirm "family values". At some point in the future, nations may be succeeded by some even more abstract identity constructs — perhaps with barely any potention for divisiveness. I don't think we're there yet, or that rushing into post-nationalism would get us anywhere. 

Hereunder is the initial unfortunate attempt to connect Earth and Mars, resulting in Earth's atmosphere leakage to Mars. By regulation, next gates were enforced to be located in outer space and limited gravitation/magnetic fields. 

Lava is a "hot fluid" [citation needed]. The technology to handle the "liquid" part is obviously available during medieval era, as irrigation is already known for centuries. For example, the first dutch polder was build from 1609 to 1612 with windmills. Digging a hole somewhere so that it can thereafter be filled with liquid is really not a challenge. Organizing the liquid flow is not a complex issue either. That said, the "hot" part is more tricky. The area where the lava flows must resist the high temperatures, and no technology is available to protect people once the lava is in place. So this may lead to some adaptations : 

All answers missing very crucial point: there is a fundamental difference in approach to building exoatmospheric vessels compared to endoatmospheric. Spaceships need to have reinforced hulls to prevent EX-plosion, while air- and sea- borne vessels are reinforced to prevent IM-plosion. One atmosphere of atmospheric pressure seems like not much, but in space it's actually a tremendous force just on it's own. Those two goals can be jointly pursued in construction, but that means excess mass. Space shuttle is not big because why? There is also a world of difference in power requirements to move spaceship in space and to move it up (and down) gravity well. I know mass is mass, but for the purposes of the question it's suffice to say there is a difference. So that means high power requirements, which also means size of the PGU (Power Generating Unit), which cuts into capacity of a spaceship's hull, as is extra reinforcements and quite possibly some aerodynamic requirements. Space combat vessel needs to be armored in some way. If you elect atmospheric braking it means that outer layer - i.e. armor - is exposed to extreme conditions not unlike combat (depending on weapons used in warfare, of course), thus weakening it enormously. Armor in spaceships has dual-purpose: prevent/absorb combat damage and shield from all sorts of radiation encountered in space. Current space tech relies on E-M shield of Earth to work in space, but spacegoing vessels have to have this sort of protection. Weakening that every time you enter atmosphere sort of defeats the purpose. Thus we get to a bottom line: I recommend dropping the idea unless you give your civ enormous power source(s) (or other techs like force fields reinforcing hull or reactionless drive of some sort) to accommodate for all the requirements of the concept.
