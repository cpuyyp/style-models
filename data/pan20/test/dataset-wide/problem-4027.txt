Let $n$ be a positive integer, and $p$ a prime number. Let $K_i$ be the cyclotomic field containing exactly the $np^i$th roots of unity. Let $H$ be the inverse limit of $p$-power torsion of the class groups of the $K_i$. Let $V$ be the $\mathbb{Q}_p$ - vector space $H \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}_p} \mathbb{Q}_p$. It is a result of Iwasawa theory that $V$ is finite-dimensional. For any integer $q$ that is relatively prime to $np$, we have an automorphism $f_q$ of $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\infty} K_i$ which, for each root of unity $\omega$, brings $\omega^q$ to $\omega$. This induces an automorphism of $H$ and thus an automorphism of $V$, say $f^*_q$. What I'm interested in is whether $\mathrm{Tr}(f^*_q) \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ is rational, and related questions. Are there situations where we know this is the case, besides obvious cases like $q = 1$ or $V$ is trivial etc.? Are there situations where we know this isn't the case? Are there related operators on $V$ that nontrivially have rational trace? Can we ever say something weaker like $\mathrm{Tr}(f_q)$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{Q}$? The reason I ask: Given a smooth projective curve $C$ over a finite field $K$ with algebraic closure $\overline{K}$, the $q$th power Frobenius morphism on $C$ induces the $\overline{K}$-linear Frobenius morphism on $\overline{C} = C \otimes_{K} \overline{K}$, which induces an endomorphism of the $\ell$-adic cohomology vector space $H^1(\overline{C}, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$. The traces of powers of this morphism yield information about the zeta function of the curve, but the only reason this works is that these traces are rational numbers (more specifically, integers) so they can be seen as both $\ell$-adic numbers or as real numbers, the latter being what we need for applications to the zeta function. To relate this to the original question, I don't think these $f_q$ morphisms are analogous to powers of the $\overline{K}$-linear Frobenius, but rather a closely related morphism, which could be briefly described as the "inverse Frobenius on coefficients", and whose powers still induce endomorphisms of the $\ell$-adic cohomology vector spaces which have rational traces which give us essentially the same information as the $\overline{K}$-linear Frobenius. So basically I want to know if a similar thing holds in the number field setting, with $V$ playing the role of $H^1(\overline{C}, \mathbb{Q}_{\ell})$, in hopes that it might yield interesting information pertaining to non-p-adic L-functions (although I don't expect anything nearly as straightforward as in the function field case). 

For what it's worth, the motivation is that this colimit is the usual definition of the sheaf on a not-necessarily-open subset $K$ (or if you like, the global sections of the inverse image sheaf under the inclusion $K\hookrightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$), and so it would be nice if this colimit had a relatively concrete description. 

For $K\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ compact, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)$ denote the space of smooth functions on (an open neighborhood of) $K$ with compact support contained in $K$ with the usual Fréchet space subspace topology inherited from $C^{\infty}(K)$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$ the dual with the Mackey topology (or, equivalently, the strong polar topology). For $U\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ open, let $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$ denote the LF-space of smooth functions with compact support contained in $U$, and denote by $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*$ the space of generalized-functions on $U$, again, with the Mackey topology (or equivalently the strong polar topology). If $K\subseteq U$, we have extension-by-zero maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)$, and we thereby obtain restriction maps $C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(U)^*\rightarrow C_{\mathrm{c}}^{\infty}(K)^*$. 

In what follows, $x$ is always taken to commute with the coefficient ring. This means that for any given polynomial, you can put the coefficients to the right or the left of $x$ as you please. This doesn't make a difference to the ring itself, but it will make a difference for the roots: a right root is an element that yields zero upon evaluation when you write $x$ to the right of the coefficients. (Similarly for left root. I suppose a two-sided root would be an element that is both a right and a left root.) For example, $\mathrm{j}$ is a right root but not a left root of the following polynomial (working in the quaternions). $$ \mathrm{i}x-\mathrm{k}. $$ 

So we have a splitting field $K_n$, explicitly constructed as a quotient of $K_0[r_1, \ldots r_n]$. Let $I$ be the kernel of the obvious map from $K_0[r_1, ... r_n]$ to $K_n$. The algorithm above also gives us a Gröbner basis for $I$: for each of the polynomials $q_i$, with $2 \leq i \leq n$ let $q'_i$ be a lift of $q_i$ to a monic polynomial with coefficients in the polynomial ring $K_0[r_1, ... r_{i - 1}]$. Then it is easy to see that $B:=\{q_1(r_1), q'_2(r_2), ... q'_n(r_n)\}$ is a Gröbner basis for $I$ with the lexicographic monomial ordering with $r_n > r_{n-1} > ... > r_1$. In general, if we have a ring $R$ with an ideal $J$, an automorphism $f: R \rightarrow R$ will induce an automorphism of $R/J$ iff $J$ is $f$-invariant, i.e. $f(x) \in J$ whenever $x \in J$. In particular, if $\sigma$ is a permutation of $\{ r_1 \ldots r_n \}$, and $f_\sigma$ is the corresponding automorphism of $K_0[r_1, ... r_n]$, we have that $f_\sigma$ induces an automorphism of $K_n$ iff $I$ is $f_\sigma$-invariant, or equivalently, $f_\sigma(b) \in I$ for each $b \in B$. Furthermore, we can test if $f_\sigma(b) \in I$ with multivariate division, which is convenient as $B$ is already a Gröbner basis for $I$. In summary, we can check if a permutation $\sigma$ of the roots of $p$ is in the Galois group by checking if $f_\sigma(b) \in I$ for each $b \in B$, and this can be done with multivariate division. 

Yes, a classical result says that every 2-dimensional (real) normed space embeds into L^1. Alternatively, if we assume that the unit ball is a $2n$-gon (the general case then follows by approximation), the corresponding space embeds into $\ell_1^n$. The dual picture is maybe even more transparent : any symmetric $2n$-gon is the Minkoswki sum of $n$ segments, and therefore is a projection of the $n$-cube. (key word : zonoid) 

This question has been studied here (but no characterization is given) Marcus, Marvin; Kidman, Kent; Sandy, Markus. Products of elementary doubly stochastic matrices. Linear and Multilinear Algebra 15 (1984), no. 3-4, 331–340. Note also that if we consider the family of matrices with rows and columns adding up to 1 (but allow negative entries) and $\alpha \in \mathbf{R}$, the corresponding result is true, see Johnsen, E. C. Essentially doubly stochastic matrices. III. Products of elementary matrices. Linear and Multilinear Algebra 1 (1973), no. 1, 33–45. 

The inequality is true for $2 \times 2$ self-adjoint matrices, because of the following formula, which is reminiscent of $\max(|a|,|b|)=\frac{1}{2}|a+b|+\frac{1}{2}|a-b|$ $$ \|A\| = \frac{1}{2} | \mathrm{tr} A | + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \| P(A) \|_2 $$ where $\|\cdot\|_2$ is the Hilbert-Schmidt (or Frobenius) norm and $P(A)= A - \frac{\mathrm{tr} A}{2} \mathrm{Id}$ is the orthogonal projection onto the subspace of trace $0$ matrices. Both terms in this sum satisfy Hlawka's inequality (the Hilbert--Schmidt norm is a Euclidean norm). Geometrically the unit ball of $2 \times 2$ self-adjoint matrices looks like a tridimensional double-cone over a disk (extreme points are reflections and $\pm \mathrm{Id}$), which is a geometric way to interpret the formula above. In the non-self-adjoint case I don't have such a clear picture. 

If $x:\Lambda \rightarrow X$ is a net in a topological space $X$ and $\Lambda '\subseteq \Lambda$ is a cofinal subset of the directed set $\Lambda$, then $x|_{\Lambda '}$ is a subnet of $x$. We call subnets of this form strict subnets. Of course, not all subnets are of this form, and indeed, the definition of a subnet is chosen the way it is in part so that certain theorems we would like to be true are in fact true. I am in particular curious about the following standard theorem. 

but yet does not provide a counter-example either. Also, I doubt this will make too much of a difference, but I would prefer the counter-example to be $T_0$. Finding an example of a highly pathological space that is, uhh, pathological, isn't exactly what I'm looking for. 

The version of the Baire Category Theorem I have in mind is the statement that a countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete metric space is dense. The question is: is it likewise true that the countable intersection of dense open subsets of a complete uniform space is dense? A look at the proof suggests that the answer should be no---it makes crucial use of the fact that the canonical uniform structure on a metric space is generated by the $\varepsilon$-balls of radius $\frac{1}{m}$ for $m\ \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. I thus started looking at complete topological groups that were not first-countable for a counter-example, with no luck (topological groups because they provide easy examples of uniform spaces, and not first-countable because first-countable topological groups have uniformities generated by a countable collection of covers (and also because (I think?) first-countable topological groups are metrizable).) Surprisingly, a quick Google search only pulled up one source that seems to mention this at all---Joshi in his Introduction to General Topology states (pg. 363)
