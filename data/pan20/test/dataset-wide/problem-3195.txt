The other large temperate areas available are in the United States, Southern China, the East Coast of Australia + New Zealand, and southern Africa. Of those, the USA also experienced a large amount of Italian immigration in this same period. The British controlled South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, and Dutch the rest of southern Africa, which may have served to deter other nationalities from settling in those places. China already had more than enough Chinese people living there. According to the link above, a large number of the people emigrating from Italy during this period were rural folk from south Italy, so being able to carry out their agriculture would have been a huge deal. 

As an American, this is a tough one, because I have a lot of respect for what that man did. According to Navy records, he earned a silver star and three bronze stars. I know one silver star veteran personally, and he's frankly a better man than I'll ever be. There have been books (plural) written about the action where he earned it. They don't give those stars out in cereal boxes. That being said, its a matter of record that in his book he claimed to have earned two silver stars and five bronze stars. So either there are somehow secret classified medals, which seems unlikely, or he lied. We also know one other incident in the book was likely not true, because Kyle lost a defamation lawsuit over it, and the gist of the suit was that the entire incident never happened. This and a couple of other unlikely incidents he reported are the subject of a very interesting Snopes article, the verdict of which was "Mostly False"*. If he exaggerated his medal count, which is easily traceable, and we know one other account in the book was at least partially made up, and a couple more outside of the book, it seems incredibly naïve to maintain that the rest of his account in that book, which would be less traceable, was entirely truthful. * - h/t to Steve Bird in the comments 

Malaria I'd actually leave it at that, if the posting software let me. But to elaborate, Europeans actually did actively try to colonize Africa continuously during the Age of Discovery. The problem was that Malaria killed them off quicker than more could be sent. The only place it really worked was in South Africa, which was too temparate for Malaria to be a big problem. Native Africans tend to have a better resistance to malaria (in part due to the same genetic trait that causes sickle-cell anemia). 

They are depicted in exaggerated form in some of the earliest representational artwork we've found, way back in the Paleolithic era. Their size on human females is far larger than is either necessary for milk production, or found in our closest relatives (the other Great Apes). The presumption has been that they have been selected for in our species due entirely to male preference for them. 

Han Chinese is of course a language with its own proud history, but it is quite unrelated to Austronesian. Its language family is Sino-Tibetian, almost all of the speakers of which have historically lived on mainland Asia. Where Chinese history and Taiwan really start to intersect wasn't until 1682, when Ming loyalist forces, seeking refuge from the victorious Qing on the mainland, kicked out the Dutch colonists on the island. The Qing themselves soon followed. Since then the aboriginal Austroneasian component of the population has been on a steady decline, replaced by Han. Today, they are only about 2% of the population. 

* - unlike the terms high church and low church, and many other English high/low couplets relating to social things, which are totally a commentary on their perceived quality. 

Well, first off, it isn't totally true that they weren't used. There were a couple of incidents during the invasion of Poland. One would imagine that the main reason they weren't used though was that they had been outlawed for (first) use in warfare by the Geneva Protocols of 1929, which Germany was a signatory to. However, in order to back this up, it appears every major combatant ammased a huge stockpile of chemical weapons, so as to create an early variant of the MAD principle. 

Ancient Greece's energies were generally oriented towards their older civilized neighbors to the east. As such, nearly all the people they traded with or conquered already had an established writing system. The colonies and trade ties they established in the uncivilized west were almost entirely usurped by Rome in the runup and aftermath of the Second Punic war. That being said, the Latin alphabet, which as a result of that is used by nearly all Western Indo-Europeans, was ultimately derived from the Greek alphabet. Much more recently the Cyrillic Script used for most Slavic languages (and several that aren't even Indo-European) uses Greek-inspired glyphs. If you combine these two scripts, it would be fair to say that Greek-derived alphabets are in use as the primary script in close to the majority of the land area of all inhabited continents on earth. 

Bulgarians: The current Wikipedia entry diplomatically lists 3 cultural ancestral components for Bulgarians: 

There are also several passages from Otway's play The Orphan reproduced, some of which are not very complimentary to women, some not very complimentary to men. It was apparently a quite popular play at the time. So I can't speak to more than the half or so in English, but from that I think its fair to say that he seemed to not be logging particularly unusual feelings toward women at the time (which is still quite bad enough, given the time in question). Perhaps some of the Latin poetry is juicier. Sadly, no Catullus though. 

It neither contradicts commons sense, nor basic economics. In classic (micro) economics, every good can be represented by two curves: A supply curve and a demand curve, plotted against price for the good and amount sold. The point where the two curves intersect defines the natural market price for that good. 

First off, there are no depictions of Jesus made by contemporaries. That means any depiction you find, anywhere, is more a representation of how the artist felt like viewing Jesus than an attempt at an accurate reconstruction of the man's features. Complicating this was the iconophobic views of early Jews (backed up by the "graven image" prohibition in the 10 Commandments) The first exemplars we have are both from 2 centuries later, and are the following: 

There were undoubtably numerous plots that made it to various stages. Where such a plot progresses to qualifying as an "attempt" is probably mostly up to the speaker. For example if it was the security services speaking, they'd have incentive to make themselves look good by being a bit generous as to what qualifies as an attempt. On the other hand, someone speaking for Mubarak himself might want to downplay how little he was liked, and thus might be more stingy in what qualifies. So to answer this question precisely, you'd really have to go to the person who gave wikipedia that number of six and ask them. 

The Mongols were pastoralists. Livestock herders. As such, their culture naturally thrived on steppe (or grassland) territory. A pastoral nation is not tied to any one place, but rather moves around with its herds to find the best grazing. A militarily dominant pastoralist society will naturally attempt to take over all good grassland territory for itself. Given that, I think a look at a map of the Eurasian steppe may prove enlightening. The green areas on the map below indicate good pasture land in Asia. Altaic pastoralists like the Mongols and Turks will naturally desire to take over all this territory possible. 

That appears to be the survey of LA drawn out by Lieutenant Edward Ord in 1849. If so, then the Fort Street in the grid-like area in the upper left area of the map later became Broadway street. Hill Street, the next over from Fort Street on the survey, is still the next street NW from Broadway today. As for where on Broadway that is, I'd say its almost certainly centered around 1'st St. For one thing, LA's grid bends a bit there much like the bend on this map. But more importantly, cities tend to grow outward, with the center of their downtowns typically occupying the area of original settlement. 

The general idea behind the Electoral College is that the states pick , they get 1 each for each congressmen and senator they have (iow: at least 3 for every state, more for bigger ones), and the Electoral College decides, based on majoriy vote, who is President. Nits: 

But again, these are the only two surviving examples of his writing. We know of more from his biographers, plus many speeches and sermons that did not get written down at the time. There is even some known early third-party biographical material that has been lost (eg: The Book of Ultán). This material is all inferior to the above two first-hand accounts of course, but in History, particularly Medieval history, you have to do the best you can with what little you have. 

Bulgarians and Hungarians actually have very different histories. Neither one of them really could be said to have ever been Turks, although they may have borrowed some things from Medieval Turkic-speakers. 

Note that there was a breif time in the late 1960's when more people were against it than for it. 30 years later, people were in favor of it 4 to one. Today, as in 1939, its more like two to one. So you could say, on this issue at least, we are exactly as "liberal" as we were duing the Depression. So I guess my answer is the old Facebook cop-out: It's complicated. 

That blog post is presenting the argument of Albion's Seed. However, he's presenting it in a somewhat twisted way. It looks like he's trying to make political points as much as he is historical ones, and that's causing him to both simplify and outright misrepresent some of his history. For that reason, I'd suggest reading the original book, if you are interested in its thesis. There certainly is evidence of cultural differences between the Northeast, the Midlands, the South, and the border areas, that persisted as the USA spread west. This has been noted from several different quarters. Let's take one example: the "border area". Historians such as Jim Webb have pointed out the cultural contribution of the Scotts-Irish, who moved into the upper south and highland areas west of there. Linguists have noted a distinctive American accent that covers this exact area: South Midland (it actually goes by many names, perhaps due to it being the lowest prestige dialect in American English). Nate Silver, in analyzing voting patterns, independently placed pretty much this same region in a grouping he refers to as "Highlands" When all these different disciplines are telling you there are real cultural differences in the same area, its a pretty good bet there are real cultural differences in that area. This doesn't just go for the Scotts-Irish either. There are major American English dialects corresponding to all of the supposed "seed" populations: New England, Midland, Southern Midland, and Southern. That these separate cultures can be traced back to fairly early in the Republic's history is well documented. The thesis that the root of this difference goes back to all the separate immigrant groups going to different areas in the USA, and further that it corresponds directly to the culture they brought with them from their original homes, seems quite plausible, but I'm not sure how well proven it is. There are certainly holes in the theory. For example, if the entire source of each group's culture came from regional English differences, you'd expect the American regional dialects to be nearly as dissimilar as those dialects are in the mother country. Instead, American speech is quite homogeneous by English standards, more like they started from a common source with influences and local separate developments, rather than like they started from wildly different sources and merged toward a set of common denominators. 

There don't really appear to be any. Let's go through a list of major US conflicts since WWII, and list how their nationals were treated during and after. Korean War - This was a Civil War where the US was helping the non-Communist side. In other words, Koreans were our allies too. No mass incarceration or deportations. Vietnam War - Same as above. After the war, there was a decade-long refugee crisis involving around 2 million people. The US took in over 100,000 initially, and many thousands thereafter1. Lebanese Civil War - No mass internements or deportations. The US took in about 60,000 Lebanese war refugees 2. First Gulf War - Similar to Korea, in that the goal was helping one Gulf state against another. There were (and are) a fair number of Iraqi-Americans at the time3. No mass internments or deportations. All indications at the time were that, Republican Guard aside, most Iraqis didn't even want to fight, and "surrendered" at the first opportunity. Probably the worst effects were (as usual for the region) felt by the Palestinians. In Kuwait they got a double-whammy; 200,000 fled harassment from their Iraqi conquerors, then another 200,000 had to flee when Kuwait's government was restored, due to their anger at the support Palestinians abroad had shown Iraq during the conflict. Probably some of these refugees ended up in the US, but I'm not aware of large numbers of them doing so. Afghanistan - The goal of this war was essentially to remove a government that was enabling the terrorist group that carried out the 9/11 attacks. Again, we had lots of Afghan allies. There were no mass deportations or internments in the US, although the US did "intern" the Taliban's money. Perhaps that counts? Second Gulf War - Situation here was similar to the First Gulf war, although this conflict did end up being far messier. Still, no mass internments or deportations in the US. So in general, I don't believe the experience of mass internments from WWII has been repeated since. To the contrary, the US has a history of taking in large amounts of refugees fleeing such conflicts. 

I don't think it is the sheer number of deaths that is the issue, but how they happened. That's just the way we think as humans. For instance, far far more people die in car accidents than airplane accidents. Even accounting for deaths per-capita (or per-trip), car accidents are a far bigger problem. However, we put way more effort into preventing airline accidents. This is because people consider that a far more horrifying way to die. I think the same principle can be applied to border crossing deaths. It could be that there are more sheer numerical deaths in a couple of bad years from US border crossings. However, those are almost entirely by people who went out into the desert to avoid patrols, and through some misadventure or the other, expired in the heat. On the other hand, the East German border crossing deaths were generally people who were shot to death by human beings explicitly paid and equipped by the state to kill such people. That's appalling pretty much however you look at it. The numbers involved are pretty much beside the point.
