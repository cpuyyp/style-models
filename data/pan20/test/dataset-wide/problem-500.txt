This 7-minute video gives an explanation of bicycle stability, discussing gyroscopic, caster, and steering effects. In particular, it shows examples of (riderless) bicycles that can balance even when one or more of the sources of stability are canceled out. Thus, there are several design features that enable stability -- including the rider. 

The plot above compares the Flow to itself. Similar to what zenbiker has noted above for the Tacx Fortius, when compared against an on-bike power meter the Flow tends to underreport -- though as one might expect from the plot above it underreports consistently. In my own case, with my own tires, a better agreement between the Flow and a Power Tap (which had been statically-checked for accuracy) could be achieved with a coast down calibration of 4 and a scale factor of 120, though I suspect that could differ from tire to tire. A greater problem for the Flow is its ability to adjust load while in "ergo" mode. In that case, one sets the power level and then, in theory at least, one can pedal at different cadences and speeds while the Flow adjusts the load to keep power constant. Sadly, here the Flow was overmatched. The plot below shows the percent error for three different scale factors (80, 100, and 120) when plotted against the ratio of "ergo power" to speed. That is, suppose you set the Flow to hold its power in ergo mode at 250 watts and pedaled at 20 km/h, then 30 km/h, then 40 km/h, and so on. The ratio of ergo power to speed (in km/h) would be 12.5, 8.3, 6.25, and so on. If the Flow were able to adjust its load at different wheel speeds, each group of points would be horizontal and parallel, and, in an ideal world one could adjust the scale factor to move some group of points up or down until it hovered over the zero error line. Why look at the ratio of power to speed? Power is the product of wheel speed and wheel torque (and a constant) so dividing the ergo power setting by wheel speed gives the torque at the Flow's roller. 

This is not an answer to your question but rather an update. Racermate has announced a recall for all "blue" flywheels, and they are replacing them. Here is the announcement and a form to get the replacement: $URL$ 

Except for the steepest of hill climbs, aero wheels will almost always improve speed; however, the choice among race wheels will depend on the types of races you do, your strengths as a racer, how important small improvements in aerodynamic drag are to your goals, and the size of your bank account. For short individual time trials, .0025 m^2 savings in CdA (roughly, one-sixth the size of the difference between a very aerodynamic front trispoke wheel and a "standard" box rim) is worth 10 seconds in 40km and can mean the difference between standing on a podium or grinding your teeth on the long drive home. For citizen-level crit races where crashes are common, you may not want to risk expensive wheels unless your riding style is so dominant that you spend the entire race off the front and turn the crit into an ITT. For a long TTT like the Styrkeproven, aero wheels certainly won't hurt but the benefit of a deep set of rims may not be worth the cost if your team time is determined by the 10th rider to cross the line (in fact, in that case, a cheaper and potentially more effective strategy is to have everyone of the team use tight clothing and low rolling resistance tubes and tires). Purely from an aerodynamic drag point of view, several of the larger wheel manufacturers (such as Zipp or Hed) provide information on aerodynamic drag differences (in grams of drag "force") between their various models and standard box rims. Most of these differences in grams "force" are measured at either 30 mph or 50 km/h. You'll want to convert this to the average speed you expect to maintain in your various types of races (the aero drag varies with the square of air speed) to make a rough estimate of the benefit you'll reap from switching to better rims. Exact calculations will depend on yaw angle but a handy rule of thumb is that a savings of 50 g of drag "force" at 40 km/h is roughly equivalent to a savings of 0.5 seconds/km at the same power output. Thus, the difference between a box rim and a trispoke front wheel could be around 1.5 sec/km, or about 1 minute in a 40km ITT. 

There's a short answer to your question and a longer fuller answer. The short answer is that a common standard for road cranksets is 130mm BCD (bolt circle diameter). The smallest inner chainring you can use with 130 BCD is a 39 (as Kibbee has said, technically you can get a 38 tooth 130 BCD chainring although that doesn't leave much metal between the lower edge of the teeth and the mounting holes). Front derailleurs and rear derailleurs can handle a change in chainring size of perhaps 13 or 14 teeth smoothly and reliably without a problem; larger differences than that can be handled but usually not quite as crisply or reliably. That's why larger front chainrings are often 52 or 53. Some bikes with triple chainrings can use a much smaller BCD. The old TA Cyclotourist crankset favored by randonneurs could use a small chainring of 24 teeth. However, when the BCD is very small the chainrings must be stronger to prevent warping since there is so much distance from the teeth to the mounting holes at the crank. Track bikes use a 144 BCD because track riders often use large chainrings (and, of course, only a single ring in a fixed gear set-up). A relatively recent standard is 110 BCD cranksets that permit a small chainring of 34 teeth. This is often paired with a larger chainring of 50. That is a difference of 16 teeth, which is right on the edge of smooth and reliable shifting with current chainring and derailleur designs. As Rider_X has noted, this recent standard was enabled by new designs that allow for stiff chainrings. So the BCD determines the smallest chainring that can be used, while the derailleurs put a limit on the largest increase in teeth from small to large chainring that can be handled smoothly and reliably. Note that two different chainring-cog combinations may have the same gear ratio (for example, a 48-24 and a 36-18 both would have a gear ratio of 2.0). If they have the same gear ratio, then at the same bike speed, your cadence would be the same. Since the bike speed is the same, the power reaching the ground must be the same. So gear ratio is the same, speed is the same, cadence is the same, power is the same -- but chain tension will be different. At the same cadence, say 60 rpm for simplicity, the chainring will make one complete revolution per second. That means that a 48 tooth chainring will move the chain 48 links (or 24 inches) per second, while a 36 tooth chainring will move the chain 36 teeth (or 18 inches) per second. Since the same power must travel from the crank to the rear wheel, the force transmitted through the chain must be higher for the slower moving chain. As an aside, this happens to have been the way that one bicycle power meter worked (the Polar chain speed and tension power meter): it had a sensor to measure chain speed, and another to measure chain tension. 

Then, using power data, you can calculate crank torque and examine the combinations of cadence and torque used to see whether you "bogged down" or were "lugging". Here is an example, with each point in the plot keyed to the numbered 30-second intervals identified in the previous plot: All of these latter uses, however, require high quality data from your power meter over a wide range of power, cadence, and torque. Because changing bilateral asymmetry in pedaling is common, especially with cadence, torque, and fatigue, the Stages is not an ideal platform for these latter analyses. However, you may be able to get an indication (though not conclusive proof) from your race data whether this is a likely problem. Since you're using Golden Cheetah, you can click on the "Aerolab" tab and see whether the virtual elevation estimated from your speed and power matches up well with the elevation recorded from the altimeter. You may have to "zoom in" on certain parts of the Aerolab plot to see areas of fit and misfit. 

There are, but measurements typically will be protocol-dependent (and vary slightly between different wind tunnels). For example: Here is a link to a comparison done at the A2 Wind Tunnel in North Carolina almost a decade ago, on bicycles standardized to frame and wheels, but without saddle or handlebars. Other protocols may include saddles, handlebars, and the standard wheels and tires provided with the bike. Here is a link to a comparison done in 2012-2013 by Trek on their Madone in the San Diego Low Speed Wind Tunnel. Note the differences in protocol. Here is a link to a Trek whitepaper on their Speed Concept. 

Depending on what you're looking for, a site like trainingpeaks.com might meet your needs. You can often find power meter data files for riders collected during both the Grand Tours (the Tour de France, the Giro d'Italia, and the Vuelta a Espana) as well as many one-day classics (like the Ronde van Vlaanderen (the Tour of Flanders) or Paris-Roubaix). From these data you can extract speed, power, cadence, gear ratios, pedal force, heart rate, and slope over different segments of a race. In certain circumstances you can estimate aerodynamic drag and other parameters of performance.
