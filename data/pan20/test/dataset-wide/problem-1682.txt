Try PS. should be loaded, installed PPS. Trust me, thermal monitoring is one of the lamest things ipmi can do - explore the power of Serial-over-LAN, System-Event-Log, PEF-traps, remote power control, boot device manipulation and KVM-over-LAN! 

and much more. You can access SEL (if it's available on your hardware) via or commands, see: ipmiutil sel - show firmware System Event Log records 

Each connection we make requires an ephemeral port, and thus a file descriptor, and by default this is limited to 1024. To avoid the Too many open files problem you’ll need to modify the ulimit for your shell. This can be changed in , but requires a logout/login. For now you can just sudo and modify the current shell (su back to your non-priv’ed user after calling ulimit if you don’t want to run as root): 

Judging by your output raising and lowering both and may slightly help. I assumed you are using somewhat recent kernel e.g. . You can see 's source code here: $URL$ 

Did you considered switching to FreeBSD? OpenBSD can't fully utilize modern SMP systems (i.e Core2Quad). FreeBSD has pf and ipfw that you can use simultaneously and also has non-GIANT networking layer. We've been running software FreeBSD routers as ISP gateways for years, this saved us a lot of $$ 

The problem is you don't have any files to build. Start with obtaining the kernel source codes. Then use link petre provided or use this one 

By Cisco router. It can do everything above and does this very good but costs $$ Do it yourself. Buy 1U server, put in NICs and setup BSD/Linux. It can do everything above + much more (i.e loadbalansing) 

It's stable, easy to expand, has a lot of documentation and integration features, so I recommend it. 

By default kernel does not output anything to serial ports. You should explictly mention it. To solve this add following to 

And even lower level hardware tunings accessible via . PS. Read kernel the docs, especially Documentation/networking/scaling.txt PPS. While tuning TCP performance you may want to consult with RFC6349 PPPS. D-Link is not the best network hardware. Try Intel hardware with pci-x or pci-64 

Just remember - don't touch if it works. So, unless system hasn't got any vulnerabilities, let it be. If it has - update it to the latest release/patchlevel or update port with recursive rebuilding of dependencies. Of course careful reading of and is a MUST. PS. Tools you'll use are doesn't really matter i think. I prefer: 

PS. Do you really need all-in-one? May be separating router and switch is acceptable? PPS. added to favorites in case you will find cheap 'n cool hardware. 

Since August 2009 flash 10 works with out problems on FreeBSD. You can use either linux-f10-flashplugin10 with f10 linuxulator or linux-f8-flashplugin10 with f8. After port instalation there is some black magic with nspluginwrapper and symlinks 

I think for load-balancing you should use specialized tools like HAProxy / nginx that have small footprint and very good performance. 

I guess that "server's control panel" software can be rewritten to be more efficient and not to degrade performance over time. NB! Do not copy/paste s from production servers - there could be some sensitive information inside that JSON e.g. logins/passwords/session/API-keys/etc. 

Frame arrives at NIC's rx descriptor ring. Through DMA it gets transferred to RX ring in RAM. Driver converts device specific descriptors in RX ring to some kind of general network kernel structure (e.g. / or ). Also here packet gets copied to bpf device. In depending on protocol and address families of the frame it gets processed by corresponding (protocol switch) array entry. Then after or / datagram arrives at socket layer to the corresponding routing daemon's (socket receive buffer). From this point routing daemon usually gets notified about pending data on socket via some kind of I/O notification facility (select(2) / poll(2) / epoll(7) / kqueue(2)) and uses recv(3) on that socket to extract packets' payload. Here / / takes it's place. Routing daemon does it's magic and alters kernels' routing table(s) via routing sockets (PF_ROUTE in BSD derivatives or PF_NETLINK's NETLINK_ROUTE in Linux) 

I have a site which is a combination of WordPress, phpBB forum and a PHP based shopping cart system. I have SSL running, and have always had it for the shopping cart, but would now like to simply redirect the entire site to https. As a test, I simply went to my browser and typed And behold, every page is being served over SSL - regardless of where I navigate. Seems perfectly normal. So, does this simple test mean I can safely do a .htaccess redirect like this? 

I'm at the mercy of a sys admin who handles middleware config for an application I'm working on. Long story short I asked for SSL to be enabled for the application. The app is split up between a PHP layer being served from Apache httpd, and a set of REST services in Java, being served by Tomcat 8.5 (standalone) on port 8443. After the sys admin told me "your SSL is fully configured", I hit the base app at: 

Does this method seem reasonable? Is there a better way to handle this, given the issue I am seeing? If I wanted to make this re-write generic to handle any incoming domain (as long as that domain does not include my base multisite domain name!) -- could someone show me how to form the condition/rule? 

Seems like there are no TXT records. Given this, does it seem like I have all the information I need and my plan is sound? I will set a low TTL at first, even though it probably doesn't matter since the MX target is not changing. (edit: I think I also have to consider and -- how do I know all the possible subdomains I need to check for DNS records?) Thanks for any advice you may have so I can complete this successfully. 

I have one lingering issue with DNS for my domain, which sits at a static IP address on a server at my hosting company which has a few other domains sharing another IP address. When I check my DNS at dnsstuff.com I get one error: 

Also, am I correct in saying that if I want one domain to map to another via CNAME then the format must have the dot at the end, to avoid ambiguity? E.g.: 

still gives a warning on SSL. So, is there a hint of some sort or guidance, link to a good how-to, or anything I can share with this person to get her some help to understand how to get this SSL working on that Tomcat/port ? 

since mod_userdir is disabled at the new host -- and I'm told that enabling it is not exactly simple. So that IP address and account name will not resolve. Great - so at the new host let's put the site at a dedicated IP address. Nope,that won't work either because the .htaccess rule that rewrites all traffic to "www." means it will break - you get this: 

My hosted zone at AWS seem to be working fine so I am a little nervous about changing it -- but I noticed that my CNAME record for my white-label DNS looks like this right now (no trailing dot): 

Running WP multisite with client's able to use their own domain name. Works great - except the case where client does not use my nameservers and simply has an A record pointing to the WP static IP address. This happens sometimes when the client DNS has a ton of service records (e.g. Office 365), it is just safer to leave DNS there. When I control DNS, I can alias non-WWW to WWW, which makes WP multisite happy. When client is just using the A record pointer, the WP multisite trips on the incoming non-WWW request and lands at the sign-up page for the multisite. It really needs the 'www', to work right (unfortunately). I solve for each client by doing this in .htaccess: 

If I understood correctly one is for input drops other for output drops (i.e ). PS. For additional information refer to Section 3.3 " structure" of the TCP/IP Illustrated Volume 2, Stevens & Wright. Or source code of you OS. 

You can probably workaround that problem by changing your docker's network settings (e.g. disable IPv6). Or if you have some time to spare you can try resolving to a LOC and try figuring out what could've caused GPF there. PS. Also you you probably haven't posted your first Oops here, since you already have and in your 

Don't assume - check! To debug your problem further you should probably look into directory for list of available kernels and check loader configuration. Also check output. 

I'm not sure that I'll be heard this time but I'll try anyway: switching to is not as hard as you think it is. But I guess you still need some kind of explanation. I propose that if you'd have only 4G of memory then a would equal to ~850mb, for 16G it would be around ~750mb and for 64G it would be ~378mb. Let me cite Linux Torvalds: 

in your case you should have with and . Also note that I set MAC of same as my wifi card. As another solution you can set up an IGP between host and guest OS (e.g., OSPF). 

I think the best solution is to drop all IPv6 traffic via firewall. There is manual how to use ip6tables in Linux: ip6tables: IPv6 Firewall For Linux 

What you think is good notebook for sysadmin? May be you can list specific models; What hardware extensions(i.e. USB devices) you think should be added to "sysadmin must-have" list; 

Install software from packages!!! Say No to source code compilation. It's 2010 now, you know? If there is no package for your software then you should build it yourself. Error message clearly says that you should run You also can try running if above doesn't work out. 

For those of you who still not tired of "XYZ for sysadmin" questions: This subject is bothering me for a long time. I had number of problems selecting notebook for job. For example: 

Also you try turning off Transparent Huge Pages (aka THP) and/or disable swap(or decrease ). Userspace To reduce userspace fragmentation you may want to try different allocator, e.g. (it has great introspection capabilities, which will give you an inside into allocator internal fragmentation). You can switch to custom malloc by recompiling your program with it or just by running your program with : (beware of interactions between THP and memory memory allocators) Although, slightly unrelated to memory fragmentation(but connected to memory compaction/migration), you probably want to run multiple instances of your service, one for each NUMA node and bind them using . 

I suppose applying that patch to your kernel should fix the problem. Also you may try to increase default rcv buffer size in both OS and application ( ) And your second question about - Linux increments that stat inside [3]. That function is usually called when socket goes over it's rcv limits. So yet again you can either increase your / and/or tune your application to make read() calls more frequently (I assume your drops are closely correlated with Java's Stop-The-World GC pauses. So, tune your GC). [0] $URL$ [1] $URL$ [2] $URL$ [3] $URL$ 

Are those servers have very different ? My guess is that your running and installed kernels are out of sync. After installation of new kernel you should generally reboot the system for changes to take effect. 

Issue looks more like a bug than bumping into a limit. Only suggestion is to update to latest stable MySQL version, or even to FreeBSD 7.2 (they higher almost all limits on FreeBSD 7.2 amd64) 

Also descriptor count can be tuned via in some NICs Regarding your question "idrops vs. drops" you should look sources for
