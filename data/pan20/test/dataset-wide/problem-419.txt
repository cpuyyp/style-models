They could meet in the "new world" the same way that colonial powers did in the Americas. Just saying that you don't necessarily need a cataclysmic event. Your races could just be looking to expand by colonizing a newly discovered land. Once they arrive they fight it out much the same way colonial powers did in the Americas and Africa. If a cataclysm is really necessary consider that they may have exhausted their natural resources. Overpopulation is an easy reason to strike out looking for new lands and resources. Things like blight, plague, and polution are all tied to population density. 

I think the only major difference you would see is a significant reduction in "biological clock marriages." Biological clock marriages here being marriages that were timed around biological issues, such as: 

The only problem I could see with your calorie system, is that you're implementing it in a post apocalyptic world... Basically I can picture people squabbling over the true vale of their foodstuffs and it's also easy to guess that in a post apocalyptic world where food and resources may be scarce that people would be inclined to barter and haggle based on perceived need. People who are starving are likely going to be willing to pay a little extra, call it gouging, but it's an unfortunate reallity. Without a governing body, or people who are really inclined to work cooperatively, establishing standard values for goods is going to be really difficult. 

I sort of like the idea of an infinite train circling the planet that never stops though, so I thought up an alternative system. Rather than having 200 circumnavigating trains you could try 1, with several "feeder" trains. Basically you have your mainline (red), traveling at a reasonably fast and constant speed. Then you have secondary or feeder trains (blue) like so: 

I suspect that the scale you're talking about would run into the square cube issue. Using the Green Anaconda as a model, our girtheist​ living snake, at 29 feet you only get a foot of diameter. Your snake would be approximately 174 feet long... That's big. If we handwave that we still have the issue that as far as we know all very large snakes have been semi-aquatic. Being huge it helps to displace your weight in water. Handwaving that we still have some issues to address. Heat being the first that comes up. A very large reptile will have problems maintaining body temperature. Some reptiles have limited reproductive endothermy, but that's still a stretch for one that's a full six feet thick and one hundred and seventy four feet long. So it'll need to be hot, like really really hot, all the time. The next issue is food. Now surprisingly this may not be as big a problem as you might think. The Green Anaconda can go weeks without a good meal, so with a slow metabolism your snake may only need a cow every week or so... But how would this monster sneak up on a cow? This leads me to the point of all this. I suspect that the only way such a creature could exist on Earth would be in captivity. Some snakes really do get significantly larger in captivity... Some even seem to match their enclosures. Now if your giant snake was carefully maintained by studious herpetologists, who very carefully cared for it, you may be able to get your monster. Unfortunately it would​n't survive long on it's own. This arrangement would require some handwavium, but a little less. These snakes exist in the wild, they're just significantly smaller. 

Isolation isn't just a matter of physical distance. Two groups can live in the same town and still have very separate communities. As unfortunate as it is racism may be the answer. For instance segregation in the American South led to distinct accents, jargon, and slang. It's not hard to imagine that if the system had continued* on a long enough timeline that a distinctly different language could emerge. * I'm aware that many communities are still heavily segregated and I hope that someday this can be remedied. 

Specificity seems like an easy solution. "I will meet you later in your timeline" "I will meet you on July, 4th 1776" I would guess that cronops agents would be agents in the typical sense of the word, so it's probably fair to assume that they're trained like military officers, or have some sort of rigid special agent schooling, so specificity seems like a reasonable fit. Possessive timelines would also make sense, as noted above. Talking about the general/historical timeline: "I will meet you later in our time" Implies the "present", for the agents. As in "once we jump back I'll see you" Talking about one's own experienced timeline: "I saw him before in my time" Works better in the past tense, but still makes sense. Admittedly the possessive timelines can get a little murky: "We will meet again in your past time" May be confusing to the listener, but there isn't really a good way to tell people that you're jumping about in time and telling them that you'll see them before you have told them wouldn't help the listener anyway.... Bad form for an agent from start to finish and should be avoided. 

I'm thinking very strict "space traffic control" would be required within solar systems. Much like our current air traffic control systems here on Earth... Pilots would be required to send in flight plans and follow commands from space traffic controllers. With crafts moving this fast, following pre-approved flight plans would be essential, you're simply going too fast to see and avoid other crafts. On approach to a planet or high traffic area the pilots would be in close communication with traffic controllers​ that would issue orders on how to safely navigate the area or when and where to land/dock. With all this pre-planning and communication it becomes a bit easier to spot errant crafts. This is the fun part... Speed limits and air traffic control orders are strictly enforced. Any unidentified craft or craft that deviates from it's flight path can and will be fired upon. First think flying a large jet, not driving a car. Then think military air base rules, not commercial airport rules. 

There have been experiments with giving squirrel monkeys color vision through gene therapy, so that part may not be as far fetched as it sounds on the surface. $URL$ Xenotransplantation is also a thing, believe it or not. But it's really limited at this point. $URL$ Xenotransplantation requires compatibly between species though. See the 'Potential animal organ donors' section of the wiki page above. I think that's going to be your biggest hurdle. Transplants between similar mammals are difficult, I suspect transplants between crustaceans and humans will be impossible. Things like blood type, size, and compatible function matter quite a bit. Blood type matching isn't possible in this case. The eye will require Hemocyanin, while the body uses hemoglobin. $URL$
