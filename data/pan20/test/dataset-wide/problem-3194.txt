Other than over-hunting, several other causes have been advocated. Climate change This is ruled out both by the bigger and clearer picture that we have (which includes extinctions over 50.000 years) and by several examples were extinctions did not occur necessarily with climate change (the best example being the survival, until mid Holocene, of a Mammoth in an Alaskan island, see. Guthrie R. D., 2004, Nature, 429, 746). Indicators of global climate change do not show any correlation with extinction patterns. Over-hunting Over hunting is the other hypothesis, and currently the most accepted one. The survival of megafauna in Eurasia and Africa to present day is explained by the fact that these animals co-evolved with our ancestors over 2 million years, and had time to develop means to defend themselves. On the other hand, megafauna in the other landmasses was naive to unknown and relatively small sized humans, which might have proved fatal. The lack of killing sites is explained with the exceptional rapidity of the extinctions. In New Zealand, for instance, the extinction of Moas was more rapid in the North than in the South Island, because of different human population densities. Accordingly, in the North it's more difficult to find butchery sites, whereas in the South more than 100 have been found already. Other causes are summarized in Burney and Flannery 2005. Burney D. A. and Flannery T. F., 2005, TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution, 20, 395 In their recent study, Turvey and Fritz 2011 claim that their results: 

One cannot be literate without books to read, and regardless on one's religious beliefs The Bible is one of the great works of literature of Western civilization. The invention of the printing press by Gutenberg, accompanied by the widespread printing of The Bible in the vulgar tongues of Europe, would put copies of The Bible in most [Northern] European middle class homes within a century. By 1610 German publishers are printing roughly 28,000 distinct titles per decade; English printers would start to catch up about thirty years later. Contrariwise, the Ottoman Empire forbid the use of printing presses by Muslims in its domain until the 18 century, roughly 300 years after Gutenberg. 

In his diary and again in his memoirs (Infantry Attacks), a certain Lt. Erwin Rommel notes during the 1915 attack on Verdun "although the most extreme command measures were necessary, although the men were properly dug into fox holes by nightfall." So just what is a junior officer's "most extreme command measure" you might ask? Presumably something along the lines of holding a pistol to the head of the soldier accompanied by words to the effect "Dig now; or I squeeze the trigger now." Possibly accompanied by much profanity to assist the soldier's hearing, and add emphasis. In the aftermath, after grumbling at twilight about the lucky adjacent company that was sheltered in a wood and didn't have to dig in, Rommel's company woke up the following morning with one dead and two wounded. The lucky adjacent company in the wood had ceased to exist as a fighting unit; the French knew well the devastating effects of tree burst artillery fire. This is why officers in line units are never issued a rifle - the time spent using one is always time spent not managing the survival of the whole unit. In this way it must always be an officer's explicit decision to pick up another man's rifle, and join the fighting line, when that is necessary to improve the unit's survival chance; but it is never to happen accidentally. 

If we instead strictly limit ourselves to documents thought as written documents only, I would like to cite: 

We know how several (hundreds?) migrations brought people from Central and East Asia towards Europe and the Middle East. Most of these people established their own rule over some land, but it seems to me that invaders either survived to date as an ethnic and/or cultural majority (Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria, ...) or disappeared as a group - leaving genetic and/or cultural heritage to different degrees (Huns, Lombards, Vikings, ...). However, when we look at the ethnic map of Europe, there is considerable less fragmentation than in the Caucasus only, especially if one considers the difference in overall extension and population, and that Europe itself contains a fair amount of impervious regions (Alps, Pyrenees, ...) The question: why so many groups survived (at least culturally) in the Caucasus compared to nearby regions? I'm interested both in geographical reasons and in historical developments (e.g. national states vs empires, political fragmentation vs centralization, ...). 

I take your question as "just before the advent of Muhammad." Therefore I will not delve into ancient history, and limit the answer to late-antiquity and early Middle Ages. First of all we have to note that people in the Arabic Peninsula could (and can) be divided geographically between the (mostly) arid North (notwithstanding oases and narrow coastal regions) and the prosperous South, with its Sabaean-Yemenite people. The South was dominated by sedentary kingdoms, and was the Arabia Felix of Roman sources, thanks to prosperous trade and local production of spices. This land became object of a struggle between Jewish and Christan preachers, with alternate phases. Judaism penetrated in the Arabian Peninsula as earlier, and became a crucial region after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. Christianity arrived later, but its universalism demanded conversion of the local people. The apex of Judaism was reached with the conversion of the King Dhu Nuwas and the subsequent massacre of Christians of Najraan. Immediately afterwards, with the approval of Byzantium, an expedition of Ethiopians, who were Christians, conquered the Kingdom and brought its independence to an end. Judaism however survived until the advent of Islam. The other areas of Arabia were instead populated by a complex marriage of sedentary people and nomadic Bedouins. The latter did not leave written records, but we know that the Arabic Hijaz was divided by the Christian zone of influence to the North (centred around Najraan) and the Jewish one to the South (gravitating Yathrib). These areas met in Mecca, which was to become the most important centre in the region, following the fall of the Sabaean South to the Ethiopians and the stalemate in the North between the Sasanid and Byzantine Empires. The religion in Mecca was complex. Reportedly, at the time of the Quraysh domination, besides Christianity and Judaism a triad of goddesses was venerated: al-Laat, al-Uzzaa and Manaat. These were daughter of Allaah, which was interpreted as either the God of the Bible or another Semitic deity. In these days, Arabia became haeresium ferax, a cradle of heresy. The importance of Judaism/Christianity was evident in that the people of Mecca, and Arabs in general, considered themselves descendents of Abraham and Ismail, which are Biblical characters. In the Sacred Months, the Arabs from far and wide would flock to the Holy City of Mecca and its Haram, the sacred precinct, and the Kaaba. They would gather for the Ukaaz, a fair which was also a scene of poetic contests, and climb the Holy Mountain of Arafaat for the pilgrimage. In the sixth century, a new concept of Arabia Sacra was emerging, alongside with the rise of the Arabs, finally aware of being a nation. Muhammad was born in AD 570 circa.

As for the promulgation of these new laws, Parish Life in Medieval England notes (Thank you sempaiscuba): 

At least one error in the preceding quote - Ulman Stromer was not the founder of an Mainz papermill in 1320, because: he was born in 1329, in Nuremberg, and kept a diary chronicling the founding of his Papermill in Nuremberg in 1390. From Scribes, Script, and Books: The Book Arts from Antiquity to the Renaissance, by Leila Avrin [1991]: 

There are international agreements on the definition of POW dating back to the Lieber Code declared by Lincoln in 1862 

HMS Victory was laid down in 1759, launched in 1765, converted to a troopship in about 1811, decommissioned militarily in 1824 into a harbour ship, and converted into a floating museum in 1924. Her hull is essentially unchanged since her reconstruction in 1796, though additional repairs were done in the 20th century. Victory's longevity is thought possibly due to the extended delay in her construction, effectively providing additional seasoning to her hull timbers. Update: Note that the restoration of the 1920's was primarily to restore the appearance that she had as Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar. This would have entailed substantial internal rework, but less so to the hull. If the hull had been substantially rebuilt at that time, it would likely NOT be in as bad shape as it currently is. Likewise note that the stern of a three-master is NOT a true structural element of the hull. It is predominantly functional and decorative, designed to let light into the middle and lower decks during battle. That is why stern rakes were so devastating in battle. 

Premise: I do not have Buxton's book, so my objections are based on other sources. The origin of this claim are to be traced in a series of references. These include: 

The ancient Seleucia was founded along the Tigris river around the year 305 BC, and abandoned in 165 AD, due to the river mutating its course (Wikipedia). However in 780 AD the Catholicos (=Patriarch) of Seleucia was the most important Christian authority, overseeing over a quarter of the world's Christians [2]. This fact alone suggests that the city was far from an abandoned site, and rather thriving. Some sources refer to Middle Ages Seleucia as Seleucia-Ctesiphon. So let's assume that the Catholicos was based in Ctesiphon; the destruction of Ctesiphon was perpetrated by the invading Arabs, who later founded Baghdad. However Again there is an inconsistency, as the Arabs burned Ctesiphon (or Seleucia-Ctesiphon) in the VII century, and founded Baghdad one hundred years later. Where were the Catholicoi(?) based meanwhile? All this is in disagreement with the most common view that Seleucia was abandoned because of Roman attacks and replaced by Ctesiphon in the II century. The neighboring Ctesiphon, was in turn abandoned in the VII century after the Arab invasion, while Baghdad was founded in the VIII century. Everything appears like a giant naming mismatch.

Rather than speculate from ignorance, I looked up one interesting chapter title on the relevant period from Gibbons: History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, to wit: Chapter XXXI: Invasion Of Italy, Occupation Of Territories By Barbarians.—Part I., and found this [my emphasis]: 

If Lee had truly understood these lessons from a half century earlier, he would have heeded Longstreet's advice for the second day at Gettysburg: 

Almost certainly. For example Admiral Bruce Fraser, the British signatory to the surrender document, hosted "notable allied leaders" on his flagship, HMS Duke of York, in ceremonies ancillary and supplementary to the surrender itself.

It is worth noting that in 1917, in the midst of The Great War (as it was then commonly known) both the French and Russian armies mutinied. That the French mutiny ultimately amounted to little was in no small measure due to both a massive assault by British forces (the Battle of Passchendaele) that occupied German forces on the Western Front, and a declaration of War by the U.S. However the Russian Amy mutiny led ultimately to the formation of the communist government in Russia that Stalin led. With a repeat conflict against Germany on the horizon in 1936, it is likely that Stalin wanted to so terrorize and cow the officers of the army that none daring enough to organize any such mutiny again would be left . Despite the fact that the Soviet army in 1941 and 1942 was much less successful against the Germans than the Russian Army had been in 1914-1916, no threat of such a mutiny ever materialized during the Second World War. 

Another thing to take into account is that, in the archaic age particularly, armies would often meet on the field of battle and then agree to settle the differences by having one warrior from each side meet. This form of battle would have been more akin to the gladiatorial matches of later periods. Since the Greeks, and even the Romans to some extent, had a romanticized concept of naked warriors it is quite possible some of these matches might have taken place naked. By the classical age, these one-on-one contests were not as common. Soldiers would have wanted to wear as little as possible, especially if the weather was hot, but they would also want protection. Hoplites usually wore greaves, vambraces, and a chest-plate. They would also carry a shield and spear, with some carrying a short sword as a secondary weapon. I have read accounts that the Spartans would occasionally cast aside their clothing and fight naked if they wanted to show total scorn to an enemy that they did not fear. Maybe there is something to that, but I have yet to see anything conclusive from primary sources that indicates this ever happened. On the other hand, while art is usually just art, sometimes it is a window on the society. Some ancient pottery art I have seen depicting the Spartans, while showing them with shields, helmets, and spears, shows them with nothing else on except a garment that covers about as much as the loincloths in 300, though of a different design. $URL$ I came across a reference in Plutarch's writings (Life of Lycurgus) which seemed to indicate that Spartan men wore only one garment on a regular basis, and that this garment left them bare above the waist. The only references made to their complete nudity was during their exercises and their games, during the latter of which the young women and girls would strip themselves and join the young men and boys. Plutarch also mentions that Spartan boys learned how to march barefoot and go naked during their training. Plutarch mentions that at the age of twelve their undergarment would be taken away and only one upper garment given them each year. This garment was a red cloak, which they would wear as Spartan soldiers once their training was complete, along with whatever armor was issued to them. The cloak itself, however, was not worn during battle, as it would be a hindrance to movement. Plutarch does not mention whether or not the Spartans wore any other clothing, so it is possible the Spartan soldiers may well have been naked in battle other than their armor. I have seen it pointed out that they would not have wanted to wear metal armor on their bare skin, yet we know that they would line the inside of their armor with a layer of leather. Keep in mind, also, that their shields offered a great deal of protection. 

I have recently written an answer to the question you have linked. There I explain in detail how, alongside preexisting polytheistic religions, the Arabic Peninsula was largely monopolized by Judaism and Christianity by the 5th century. The structure of religious belief was then not different from that of other countries of the time. By the 6th century, Mecca was emerging as the most important centre in the peninsula. It became known as the Holy City, and there were Sacred Months during which the Arabs from every corner would gather there. Already before the advent of Islam, the Kaaba was a temple. It was believed that Abraham had built it, and pilgrims would circumambulate it much like modern Muslims. Before the prevalence of monotheism, the land was divided between a mostly nomadic north and a sedentary South. The latter was a pragmatic society, that did not leave many writings concerning religion and philosophy. In fact, we do not know very much about the structure of ancient religons, when compared with the Greek one, so your comparison is somewhat unfair. Source: The Cambridge History of Islam 

Here things are complicated, because of the repeated pillage of Rome, because of the diffuse looting during decadence times and perhaps most importantly, because of the edict that made Christianity the Roman State Religion under Theodosius. However, in the thesis I linked, there is a passage that reads: 

Lee's entire Pennsylvania campaign was predicated on the notion that the Army of the Potomac could be destroyed in a single massive battle, a Pennsylvania Cannae if you will. And that if this battle was fought to a successful conclusion, any number of Confederate casualties was acceptable for such a victory. But this was no more possible for Lee in 1863 than it was for Grant in 1864-5. Only a long series of battles could destroy either the Army of the Potomac or of Northern Virginia because, just as for Napoleon's Grande Armee in 1813-4: 

The Canal is 8400 miles from Tokyo, compared to 4000 miles for Pearl Harbour. The Japanese carriers are stated of having a range of 10,000 miles at a cruising speed of about 16 knots, but remember that drag varies as the square of speed. Under battle conditions at speeds approaching 30 knots range would have shrunk to barely a quarter of that. For a mission that far east of Pearl one must consider the entire sail back as being under battle conditions, potentially requiring not only a refuel upon approaching the target but 3, 4, or even 5 refuels on the way back, depending on how close to Pearl one dares venture. (Note that the great circle route from Panama to Tokyo goes right over Pearl.) Those tankers barely achieve 16 knots, so must be wandering around in the Eastern Pacific for a long time before and after the attack. To destroy this carrier force all that is necessary is to destroy one of the refueling flotillas. Plus, the entire return mission probably needs to be performed under radio silence - note how a single poorly timed radio message ended the Bismarck's career earlier that year. Couple the dangers of the mission with the difficulties of destroying, or even significantly damaging, the locks and gates of the canal, and the chances of the attack being successful are very low. One note - it is probably better to sink vessels in the canal locks, turning them into sunken hulks, rather that the locks themselves. Several such sinkings would disable the locks for some time with a far better success rate than directly attacking the canal infrastructure. This map of the North Pacific from Tokyo to Panama (red x's) shows a likely route from Japan to Panama that attempts to stay away from U.S. (and friendly)possessions. The busy sea and air routes from Vancouver and San Diego (and thus also San Francisco and Los Angeles) to Pearl are enclosed by the black lines. Note the distance, and thus time, spent east of Pearl. Any attempt to approach Panama through the South Pacific is almost 3,000 miles longer, with consequent additional fuel requirements, plus the additional danger of being spotted wandering through Polynesia and Micro-/Mela-nesia while being hunted. The actual attack on Pearl was launched while the Japanese carriers were somewhat west of the northernmost black line, about half way between its intersection with the blue line and Pearl.

If the meaning of 4. seems obscure, you are in good company. Perhaps it refers to the futility of Ireland's politics. Arguably the Catholic Irish did not approve the Italian conquest of the Papal States (1870). 

Incidentally, it might be interesting to know for western ignorant folk (like me) that this book was "pivotal in reviving Persian language after the Arabic infulence". Back on topic, because I do not have a copy of it at hand, I relied on a random website for the translation of the relevant passage, as reported in Yalom's book [7] (pages 4-5): 

While investigating on Albania, I kept finding peoples I never heard of before. Notwithstanding my vast ignorance, this was systematic to the point that I started investigating. Take a look at this map: it does not even reproduce all of the ethnic groups. The overabundance is so evident that this question is asked elsewhere on the internet (with no answer, spare that click for later). This website has a comprehensive list of ethnicity, but offers no answers. I was impressed reading: 

Most lower class Romans and slaves wore only a knee length tunic, if they even had that much clothing. Many in modern times have indicated that wearing an undergarment was considered being naked, yet the Greek word that was usually used in the period to refer to someone who was naked was gymnos, which means a complete lack of clothing. Those who try to say otherwise often do so because the idea of public nudity makes them uncomfortable, so they use modern cultural mores to influence one's interpretation of history. Historical studies of the culture of the time indicate that public nudity was not at all unusual for fishermen, or for those working in the fields or in mines, even in cases when there were women present. Nudity in public was also not uncommon during athletic events. The author of the book of Hebrews makes reference to this in Hebrews 12 verse 1, in which he uses the analogy of a runner laying aside the garments and running naked to represent stripping off sin that weighs down the Christian. This is not an analogy that many people in modern Christianity are comfortable with, but the early Christians would have understood the analogy just fine. I have seen many insist that the Romans couldn't have crucified people naked or that Peter couldn't have been naked on his boat because they "can't imagine" complete nudity in front of passers-by including women and children could have been acceptable. I would say that how we imagine the past to be does not determine that is how it was. Nudity has been used in punishment throughout history, and has also been common for those working in physical and dirty jobs (fishermen, miners, etc.). Defeated people throughout history had their clothing taken away to shame them. This shame was not the shame we have in modern times due to the mores that originated in the Victorian era, it was because to be denied clothing was the mark of a slave, though the same people who would have been shamed by having their clothing forcibly taken would willingly lay it aside to work or exercise if it was their choice. The shame, then, was due to forced nudity, not the state of nudity in and of itself. A modern analogy might be that a person would likely feel embarrassed and shamed if they were attacked and had their clothing stripped off of them leaving them in just their underwear, yet when they go to the beach they might be perfectly willing to wear a bathing suit that covers no more than the underwear would. The problem with many people today is that things like this in history don't make them feel all warm and fuzzy and so they dismiss it due to their FEELINGS. Well, feelings don't define the historical record, and if someone thinks they do they are dabbling in the wrong field.
