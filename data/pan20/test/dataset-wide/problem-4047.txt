For any category $B$ with small hom-sets one can form the yoneda embedding $y:B\to[B^{op},Set]$ (although if $B$ is not small, $[B^{op},Set]$ may not itself have small hom-sets). Rosebrugh and Wood showed link text here that if $B$ is itself the category of of sets then there is an adjoint string $u\dashv v\dashv w\dashv x\dashv y$, and that this characterizes $Set$. The adjunctions $\pi_0\dashv Dis\dashv U\dashv CoDis$s also work if we replace Top by any of the categories SSet of simplicial sets, Cat of categories, Gpd of groupoids, or Preord of preorders. 

which describes the sense in which the construction you call Spec is analogous to the symmetric algebra construction. Bunge and Carboni give a biadjunction between the bicategory R, which is the opposite of the bicategory of Grothendieck toposes, and the bicategory A of locally presentable categories and cocontinuous functors (equivalently, left adjoints). 

Hi Jim, not sure if this is the sort of thing you are after, but here is one possibility. Let $K$ be a category and $F=(f_i:A_i\to B_i)_{i\in I}$ a family of morphisms in $K$. Say that an object $X$ is injective to $F$ if for each $i\in I$ and each $a:A_i\to X$ there exists a morphism $b:B_i\to X$ whose restriction along $f_i$ is $a$. The collection of all such objects $X$ (for given $F$) is called an injectivity class in $K$. Any injectivity class in $[C^{op},Set]$ defines a property of objects of $C$: those objects $c$ for which the representable functor $C(-,c)$ lies in the injectivity class. Your various examples arise in this way: 

Regarding the specific example, the construction of $C'$ can be tightened up as follows. The first functor, from $C$ to $C'$ is not just hom-preserving (closed) but bijective on objects. The second functor, from $C'$ to $D$, has the property that it is fully faithful on maps out of the monoidal unit. (This is enough to determine $C'$ uniquely. As is implicit in Scott's comment, you need more than just the fact that the first leg is closed, otherwise you could take the first map to be the identity.) So you could consider the (2-)category of symmetric monoidal closed categories, and (strong) symmetric monoidal functors. Any such morphism $F:C\to D$ comes with a canonical comparison $F[c,d]\to[Fc,Fd]$, and we can call it (strongly) closed if these comparisons are invertible. There's a class E of morphisms consisting of those which are bijective on objects and closed, and a class M of morphisms consisting of those for which $F$ induces a bijection between maps $i\to c$ and maps $Fi\to Fc$, for all $c$, where $i$ is the monoidal unit. (You might call these maps pre-fully-faithful, or something like that.) These classes E and M are closed under composition. I haven't checked in detail, but it looks like they have a reasonable chance of being orthogonal to each other, and so you would have a factorization system. I don't see a way of doing something similar with mere functors between monoidal categories. But perhaps this is too much to expect. In the other example, although the internal hom is not preserved, there is a canonical comparison. So perhaps rather than looking at plain functors you should look at the lax monoidal ones (often just called monoidal, with the word strong being added to mean preservation up to isomorphism). Now it is true that every lax monoidal functor $C\to D$ factorizes as a lax monoidal $C\to C'$ followed by a strict monoidal $C'\to D$, moreover in a universal (initial) way. For any monoidal category $C$ there is a lax monoidal $p:C\to C'$ with the property that composition with $p$ induces a bijection between lax monoidal $C\to D$ and strict monoidal $C'\to D$, for any $D$. (Notice that the order is opposite to that in your example: the strict map comes second.) This situation is quite common, and holds for many different types of structure. It is much less common, but does sometimes happen that there's a universal factorization $C\to D'\to D$ with the map $C\to D'$ strict and the map $D'\to D$ non-strict. Your example involves an extra ingredient involving the bijective-on-objects and pre-fully-faithful conditions. 

Let R be the reflection and r the unit of the reflection. Semi-left-exactness says that R preserves each pullback of a component rX:X->RX of the unit along a map A->RX with A in the subcategory. Stable units says the same thing, but without the requirement that A be in the subcategory. This turns out to be equivalent to R preserving all pullbacks over an object of the subcategory. 

A. This is really just an aspect of Mike Shulman's answer, but could be of some use in particular cases. There's a 2-categorical limit called the power (or cotensor) of an object $B$ by the arrow-category $2$. This is an object $B^2$ with the property that morphisms from $A$ to $B^2$ are in bijection with pairs of morphism from A to B with a 2-cell between them. For example if B is a category then $B^2$ is the functor category $[2,B]$. If $B$ is a monoidal category then $B^2$ is $[2,B]$ with the evident (pointwise) monoidal structure. In each of your examples, and more generally in Mike's setting, this limit exists in the structured 2-category, and is preserved by the forgetful 2-functor into Cat. Normally you would prove this given the definition of 2-cell. But you can also turn this around. Given a structure on B, if you know how to make $B^2$ into a structured object, then you can use this to define the structured 2-cells. In examples where the structure is given by a 2-monad, and in particular in examples which involve structure described by operations $B^n\to B$, natural transformations between these, and equations, then you can always do this in a "pointwise way". (But if you choose a strange way to make $B^2$ into a structured object you will get a strange notion of 2-cell.) Suppose, for example, that $B$ is a monoidal category. Once you agree to make $[2,B]$ monoidal in the pointwise way, then you can define a monoidal transformation to be a monoidal functor with codomain $[2,B]$, and this will agree with the standard definition which you referred to. In the case of a cocomplete category $B$, you don't need to choose how to make $[2,B]$ cocomplete, it just is. And then you can consider cocontinuous functors with codomain $[2,B]$; once again this will give no extra condition to be satisfied by a natural transformation between cocontinuous functors The case of symmetric monoidal categories can be treated in the same way. B. Regarding the case of symmetric monoidal categories, there is a general phenomenon here. As you add structure to your objects in the form of operations $B^n\to B$ (like a tensor product) you generally introduce preservation conditions on both morphisms and 2-cells (although there are special cases, as in your Example 2, where the 2-cell part is automatic). But if you introduce structure in the form of natural transformations between the operations $B^n\to B$ (such as a symmetry), this results in new preservation conditions for the morphisms but not for the 2-cells. C. Despite all this, there can be more than one choice for the 2-cells. The general principles described by Mike (and by me) would suggest that if our structure is categories with pullback, so that our morphisms are pullback-preserving functors, the 2-cells should be all natural transformations between these. But sometimes it's good to consider only those natural transformations for which the naturality squares are pullbacks. (These are sometimes called cartesian natural transformations.) See this paper for example. 

a category $C$ with an action $V\times C\to C$ of the monoidal category $V$ on $C$, which we may write as $(v,c)\mapsto v*c$, for which $-*c:V\to C$ has a right adjoint for each $c\in C$ (here the action amounts to a strong monoidal functor $V\to [C,C]$. a $V$-category $C$ for which the $V$-functor $C(c,-):C\to V$ has a left adjoint for each $c\in C$. (such a $V$-category is said to be "tensored'' or "copowered'') 

The category of all monads on Set (often this is called $Mnd$, and $Mon$ means the category of monoids) is not just large, but has large hom-sets. But if you restrict it to the full subcategory $Mnd_f$ of all finitary monads, then you get a beautiful category: it is not just complete and cocomplete but locally finitely presentable. It is even monadic over the category $Set^N$ of families of sets indexed by the natural numbers. The finitary monads are the ones that correspond to finitary (one-sorted) algebraic theories, and so include the monads for monoids, commutative monoids, groups, rings, Lie algebras (over a given field), and so on. More formally, a monad is finitary when its endofunctor part $T:Set\to Set$ preserves filtered colimits, or equivalently when $T$ is the left Kan extension of its restriction to finite sets. An example of a monad which is not finitary is the ultrafilter monad, whose algberas are compact Hausdorff spaces. Instead of finitary monads, you can take monads of rank $\alpha$, for some regular cardinal $\alpha$ - these are the ones whose endofunctors preserve $\alpha$-filtered colimits, and which can be described in terms of $\alpha$-small operations and equations. The full subcategory $Mnd_\alpha$ of $Mnd$ consisting of the monads of rank $\alpha$ is also locally finitely presentable. For example $Mnd_f$ is just the case where $\alpha=\aleph_0$. The inclusion $Mnd_\alpha\to Mnd$ does preserve colimits (in fact it has a right adjoint), and so $Mnd$ does have colimits of diagrams of monads with bounded rank. An example of a monad which does not have a rank is the powerset monad, whose algebras are the complete semilattices. 

This should probably be a comment but I don't know how to include links in comments. Results of this type are often called adjoint triangle theorems. There are many such: see John Power's paper A unified approach to the lifting of adjoints for a summary (and a unified approach). A sufficient condition for $H$ to admit a left adjoint is that $C$ has coequalizers and that $G$ is ``of descent type''. (This means that if we form the monad $S$ on $A$ induced by $G$ and its left adjoint, then the induced functor $B\to A^S$ is fully faithful.) This includes the important examples of the type considered in Todd's answer. for a summary. 

Question 2: this does not really depend on line bundles. If $\phi:\mathcal {L\to L}$ is a non-invertible epimorphism, then $\phi\otimes 1:\mathcal{ L\otimes L'\to L\otimes L'}$ is epi, since $-\otimes\mathcal L'$ is exact, and non-invertible, since otherwise $\phi\otimes 1\otimes 1:\mathcal{L\otimes L'\otimes L\to L\otimes L'\otimes L}$ would be invertible. Thus there is a non-invertible epimorphism $\mathcal {O\to O}$. Question 3: this has the same answer as Question 2. If the answer to Q2 is yes, then we can take $\psi$ to be the identity and get a positive answer to Q3. If the answer to Q2 is no, then (as above) if $\phi:\mathcal{ L\to L}$ is a non-invertible epimorphism, also $\phi\otimes 1:\mathcal{ L\otimes L'\to L\otimes L'}$ is a non-invertible epimorphism. But now if $\psi:\mathcal {L'\to L'}$ is any map, then $\phi\otimes\psi=(1\otimes\psi)\circ(\phi\otimes 1)$ and if this is invertible then $\phi\otimes 1$ is split monic and so invertible (since it is already known to be epi). 

Think about the sheaves on some site as a full subcategory of presheaves: $Sh(C)\to PSh(C)$. This has a left adjoint, called sheafification. There are various ways to construct the sheafification, but one of them uses something called the plus-construction. For any presheaf $F$ it gives an associated presheaf $F^+$, which is always separated but may not be a sheaf. (Being separated means that there is at most one way to glue local bits of data, as opposed to exactly one way for a sheaf.) If you do this a second time, to get $F^{++}$, you do get a sheaf, and if you do it a third time it has no further effect. Thus $sss=ss$ if $s$ is this plus-construction. There is a higher-dimensional version involving Cat-enriched presheaves and stacks, where you have to do the analogous construction three times. This would give an example of $ssss=sss$. I don't know if this continues in still higher dimensions. 

there is a topology j and a larger topology k for which E consists of the objects which are sheaves for j and separated for k the reflection preserves finite products and monomorphisms and is semi-left-exact the reflection preserves monomorphisms and has stable units 

As I mentioned in the comment above, "weak limit" is normally defined as for limit, but with the universal property modified to ask only for existence not uniqueness. The 2-dimensional limit notion in which all equations between 1-cells are replaced by suitably coherent invertible 2-cells is usually given the prefix "bi". Any 2-category with finite limits (in the strict 2-categorical sense) also has isocomma objects (defined like comma objects but with an invertible 2-cell), pseudopullbacks, and bipullbacks. If V has finite limits (in the ordinary sense) then V-Cat has finite limits (in the strict 2-categorical sense). (The parts of this that relate to the original version of your question are dealt with in Finn's answer.) 

The fact that codiscrete cofibrations and discrete fibrations are equivalent is a very special exactness property of the 2-category Cat. I can't, off the top of my head, think of any other interesting examples. It's not true, for example in the 2-category 2-Cat of 2-categories, 2-functors, and 2-natural transformations you refer to, or in most (all?) other 2-categories of the form V-Cat. Consider, for example, the case where V=Cat and A=B=1. Then CodCofib(1,1) is just (the underlying ordinary category of) Cat. On the other hand, Fib(1,1) is 2-Cat, but discreteness of a fibration says that the 2-category A has an underlying ordinary category which is discrete. If you want to move from 2-Cat to Bicat, you'd first have to decide how you want to make Bicat into a 2-category (or decide what you mean by internal discrete fibrations or codiscrete cofibrations in a tricategory). But I wouldn't hold out too much hope .... 

According to Mac Lane (see p19 of this paper) they were introduced by Eilenberg-Zilber in 1950 under the name complete semisimplicial complexes. 

You can see this, for example, in the appendix to this paper. In your case, unless I've misunderstood, the centre $Z(C)$ plays little role. The point is that your functor $z:V\to C$ induces an action via $v*c=z(v)\otimes c$, and $-*c$ has a right adjoint by assumption, so you get the $V$-enrichment. (There is an analogous characterization of $V$-categories $C$ which are cotensored/powered: this means that each $C(-,d):C^{op}\to V$ has a left adjoint.) 

It's not hard to show that this is true in the category Set, and proofs have been written down in many places. But all the ones I know are a bit fiddly. Question 1: is there a soft proof of this fact? For example, here's a soft proof of the fact that filtered colimits in Set commute with binary products. If $J$ is a filtered category, and $R,S:J\to$ Set are functors, then $$colim_{j\in J} R(j)\times colim_{k\in J} S(k) \cong colim_{j\in J} colim_{k\in J} R(j)\times S(k)$$ $$\cong colim_{(j,k)\in J\times J} R(j)\times S(k) \cong colim_{j\in J} R(j)\times S(j) $$ where the first isomorphism uses the fact that Set is cartesian closed, so that the functors $X\times-$ and $-\times X$ are cocontinuous; the second isomorphism is the "Fubini theorem"; and the third isomorphism follows from the fact that the diagonal functor $\Delta:J\to J\times J$ is final. Is there some way to extend this to deal with equalizers and/or pullbacks? (The case of the terminal object is easy.) For the sort of person who'd rather just prove the fact directly (which after all is not that hard), it's worth pointing out that this proof works not just in Set but for any cartesian closed category with filtered colimits. It works without knowing how to construct colimits in Set. So another way to ask my question might be Question 2: what is a class of categories in which you can prove that filtered colimits commute with finite limits (without first proving that this is true in Set)? So yes, I know that the commutativity holds in any locally finitely presentable category, but the only proofs of this I know depend on the fact that it is true in Set.
