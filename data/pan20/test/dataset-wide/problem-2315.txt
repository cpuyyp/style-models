All of your situations look like emergencies, especially if you are alone. I read an article where the National Park Service was angry at use of PLBs because someone climbed a mountain and did not want to down-climb, or they were "tired" but seemed to not have nay other condition that would negatively affect their ability to walk out of the wilderness, or they had a single 1-liter canteen and ran out of water in the desert. I believe misuse of the PLB is when you didn't do your due diligence or continue trying to solve the problem until you were out of options. I think as long as you are able to walk/self rescue, then do so. You may be asked to foot the bill for any sort of rescue, and that will likely be several thousand dollars. If it's worth 5000 bucks to get help, then you are likely ready to flip the switch. 

Tent: A 2 person tent divides up really well between Tent/rainfly, and poles/groundcloth, a 4 person tent breaks down each component even more. Share with a bigger tent and you should be good to go Sleeping Bag: Go in the summer months, when the temperature will be warm. I live in the Mid-Atlantic, and typically take an Army Surplus Poncho liner as my sleeping bag on trips in the late spring-early fall. In the height of summer, I bring a cotton sheet (I know, cotton is bad, but it's all I got). Sleeping Pad: If you are careful about your sleeping spot you don't need one of these. However, it's always the first "luxury" item that I pack. I won't camp without my mattress. If you can, however, I'd loan mine to the newbie friend, or use a spare/borrow one from a friend. Stove: Most backpacking food reads like: Boil X volume water. Add powder. Stir. Let sit Y minutes. Plan to share food/utensils, and you should be good to go. Food: Again, double up and plan to cook/eat 2 person meals instead of 2-1 person meals. Eating Utensils: All the friend would need is the bowl and spoon. Bowls can be repurposed from frozen dessert topping containers, large butter/margarine tubs, etc. Sure, it will fall apart after a few uses, but you can't beat the price Water Bottles: If you know anyone who beverages out of plastic bottles, collect and reuse them. Wash them out and use as water bottles. I've personally used 1 liter soda bottles for months before they wear out. Best part, it's free (assuming you'd drink the soda/water/juice to begin with). Backpack: Either borrow a full pack from a friend, or pack as much as you can in your pack and have him bring along the biggest backpack (daypack) he has. Alternate days. One final note: You can rent almost all the gear needed from a local REI. I'm not sure if you need to be a member (recommended if you will be buying a lot of gear), or if they will rent to Joe Public, but worth looking into. 

Both my fiancee and myself bought some climbing gear recently and we're planning our first trip to an indoor rock gym this weekend. We decided to practice our knots and belay technique before we went so we rigged some rope to a chin-up bar to practice letting one person hang while the other person held the "brake" position to get used to how it would feel. The problem is, while I could hold my fiancee just fine, she weighs about 70 lbs less than me and had a really hard time holding my weight, in fact she could barely hold it at all. I'm worried that she won't be able to hold me if I were to fall while climbing. Surely, we can't be the first climbing pair to have different weights...is there a way to fix this? Is there any mechanical advantage of having the "lever" of the top rope much higher than the practice chin-up bar is? EDIT: From some research, it seems like there may be a difference when top-roping vs. lead climbing? For reference, we will only be doing top-roping for the foreseeable future. FOLLOW-UP: We just got back from climbing for the first time today at an indoor gym and we didn't have any trouble at all. My partner anchored herself to the ground as mentioned in the answers and the weight wasn't even an issue. Thanks for any insights! 

Is there any special effective technique (parkour or something similar) for crossing very high and dense mountain pine? Those ones can be really dense, and sometimes the only possibility to cross them is to walk on the top of them, and crossing it is usually very slow and tiring, especially with big backpack that likes to hook the branches. 

When hiding something in the forest on the surface, there's a great practice called UPS (Unusual Pile of Sticks, the German version is very sweet: Hasengrill). They prevent people from boaring a few acres of land and are great replacement for spoiler photos. However, snow makes them invisible. How should I build my UPS to make it visible even in winter? Well, for 2-meter thick snow nothing would help, but it's usual, at least in Central Europe, that snow has 10-20 cm. 

Wearing gloves constantly is quite normal in the temperatures below -10 C, and on the high altitudes, the temperatures are much lower. Additionally, metal has high warm conductivity, which means, touching it will quickly drawn warmth from you. There are anecdotes about stupid guys tricked by mean girls to lick the axe by the low temperatures, which causes the tongue to immediately freeze to the axe. You can try at home, cooling some metal item in the fridge, and touching it (but not with your tongue!). But the freezing temperature is enough reason to wear gloves, even if you don't have to touch anything. Answering your question, when to wear gloves when touching metal surfaces. It's quite dependent on the person, some people may get extreme uncomforable already at +5 C. But with temperatures below -10 C, I would in any case recommend wearing gloves, because of the freezing effect. 

Obviously safety is usually a relative concept, what seems safe for you might not be for others, so answers here may vary. I don't have experience with geocaching, but I do have a lot of experience with reptiles. I'm a hobbyist wildlife photographer specializing in reptiles, amphibians and insects. When reaching into an unknown area, the safest thing that I do is first use a long stick to sweep the area. In your case, if you thought a cache was in a tree hole, you could use a long stick to sweep around inside. This is usually good enough to scare away snakes, any mammals and lizards. Most reptiles are not territorial in the way that mammals are so it's fairly easy to scare them off. As far as spiders or other dangerous insects, usually the stick is enough, but I would still recommend wearing thick gloves if you're worried. There are even kevlar reinforced gloves that make venomous snake handling safer, but they are fairly expensive. Other visually observing the hole, or using another tool (such as a stick) to clear the hole, I don't know of any foolproof methods of making sure a cache area would be 100% safe. 

I prefer taking light trekking shoes and sandals. Sandals are very light and take little place, and they are perfect when it's very hot and terrain is light. I often get blisters when my feet are sweating and it's hot, especially when walking on asphalt. In the winter, however, I take heavy trekking shoes. But I have also running shoes - but I use them exclusively for running. If I would have to decide for only one pair, I would choose light trekking shoes. 

I've registered some caches in Poland. It strike me that reviewer from GeoCaching was asking how I'm supposed to service caches far from my home location. In the meantime I moved to Germany, which made caches registered near my 'home' location less serviceable than those register 'far from', but near my family location. I'd like to register some caches here in Germany, but I know, that it is quite probable I will change my location in a few years, and probably I will never have permanent 'home' location. What should I do? I would like to register some caches, but I know I could service them no longer that a few years. Am I expected not to registered any caches at all, or I could create mountain caches, which are normally community-services? What proceeding will be accepted by geocaching community? To be clear, I'm not asking for personal advice, but for general guidelines to obey in such cases. 

Personally you don't need to go for any of the name-brands, unless that is important to you. Some things to look for: 

I found this with a quick google, but since I think you want more: Find a local chapter of the Appalachian Trail Club. Here near DC, it's the PATC. They typically do walks on various nearby trails (in addition to maintennance). Second, go to your local outdoors store. Around here, there's a book called Circuit Hikes in Shenandoah park. I'm sure any local park near you would have a similar book. 

If you want an exact answer, there is not and will not be one until about 15 seconds after you finish walking the walk. For a decent ballpark, I was taught in scouts: day hiking: 3 miles per hour, + 1 hour for every 1000 feet of elevation climb. backpacking: 2 miles per hour, +1 hour for every 1000 feet of elevation climb. Use the formula, and then take a few walks. You should get a rough idea how your pace measures up to the formula and be able to adjust the formula accordingly. 

From my experience, I would recommend getting a larger pack, especially if you're planning to do longer trips. Also, if you ever go on a trip in the winter, it will usually require more clothing and possibly larger sleeping bags/mats. For reference, I have a 48L pack and that is enough room (for me) for about a weekend trip. If I'm sharing gear with others, I can extend that. To me, a 55L pack sounds pretty small for a 10 day long trip, so I would recommend something at least 65L. 

Absorption - Try to absorb as much water as possible by stuffing them with old newspaper or dry towels. Ventilation/Circulation - You want warm (but not hot), dry air to be able to reach the wet surfaces of the gloves. I've turned mine inside out and they seemed to dry faster, but it depends on how rigid and easily inside-out-able your gloves are. If you can prop them up, get them next to a warm air vent if you've got one. 

I've always either used 3-in-1 oil or the gun oil, the kind used for cleaning and caring for firearms. These both have always worked fine for me for years and years of use. Usually I just wipe a small coating of the oil on with a shop rag before leaving it for a while. Make sure it's clean and dry before applying the oil. EDIT: AFAIK the type of oil or ingredients shouldn't make too much of a difference. As mentioned in another answer, the oil is there to repel water (which causes rust and ruins the blade) and protect against dirt. So any type of basic household oil should work fine. 

know if you will be going through marshy areas. If you are hiking in the Everglades, pack more socks than if you will be hiking through the Sahara. If you have to cross a river, try to not cross in your boots. There is a favorite trail in my area, and it ends with crossing a waist-deep river. I'll drop pack, change into my trail-sandals, stuff the socks into my boots and tie them onto my pack. After that crossing, I typically don't change back as the car is less than 1/4 mile away, but otherwise I would change back to boots on the other side of the river. In wet areas (lots of stream crossings, or squishy trails), every rest stop starts with taking off the boots, removing the insoles and taking off socks. Everything goes into the sun, while I'm resting in the shady. If my feet are still wet towards the end of the break, I'll wipe down my feet with a bandana before getting put back together. In general conditions, I'll 2 pairs of liners, 2 pairs of outer socks, and will alternate between days. However, if there will be a day 7 of walking, I'll bring an extra pair of liners and outer socks which will then enter the rotation somewhere around day 5. Hang yesterday/tomorrow's socks on the outside of your pack to help them dry. You could easily skip the extra liners since they tend to dry as quickly as you can pull them out of wash-water. if all else fails, you could take a day with short miles and hike in your "in camp" shoes which should be dry and will help your boots/socks dry. 

Baby sling may be a much better option, because it weights less and is easier to pack when not used. It would be also easier to adapt to the size of the dog, and with a bit of skill, you can make it yourself from a bit of an old sheet or something similar. 

The wolf, the wild ancestor of the dog, has extreme running endurance. According to this article, many wolfs travel more than 50 miles daily searching for food. I've read somewhere, that wolfs can chase moose for a few days, but I can't find that now. Wolf is very similar to us in that domain, human hunters can also run for days. This can be another reason that two species have formed so special relationship so early. Looking for great dog runners, look on dogs that are the most similar to their ancestors, such as the German Shepherd (in my country, this race is called Wolfie). If you choose Husky, you can even count for sleight transport if you are tired. Probably it would be you who would have problems to cope with the distance. 

Another tip (although this wasn't asked in the question) is to keep the smell from neoprene things like this (they often start to smell pretty bad if sweat is allowed to sit in them for too long) is to dry them out thoroughly every time. If you've sweated pretty heavily in them, gently rinse them with cool water and possibly mild soap depending on the material and then let them dry. This will prolong the life of your gear and make them not stink like a sock. EDIT: To answer the addition to your question: I think silica gel could certainly help, and I've got a friend who has used it successfully on hiking boots, but it definitely took a lot longer than the absorption/air drying method. 

1.) I would be hesitant to advise you to put them in the dryer. I've never tried or experienced it myself, and my evidence is completely anecdotal, but I've heard that the neoprene has the potential to turn brittle if exposed to forced heating. 2.) The two main things to consider when drying out gloves like this (as well as other things like boots, socks, etc) is this: 

I'm not sure what you are afraid to destroy with you fire. You should remove any plants around the fireplace anyway. The bigger problems are the remains of the fireplace, such as partially charred logs, which can stay there for months. They are more an aesthetic problem, and they will be eventually utilized by the nature, but it takes much time. From my experience, if you let the logs burn completely, and you'll scatter the ashes, the remains of the fire will disappear very quickly. If you extinguish fire with water, they will hold log. Of course, you can scatter the ashes only when they are cold, for example the day after (in winter you can do that quicker, since you can throw them into snow, reducing fire risk to null). 

Generally the far from the civilization you go, the safer your things are. Thiefs are operating there where people live or where there are a lot of people. Distant rocks, caves etc. are not their target. I have not heard of something being stolen from someone's luggage in mountains, for example. If some point is at least a few km far from the place where you can go with car, you can trust people there. However, you may consider masking your luggage with some wood or leaves, or hide at least the most valuable things under a rock, in not so obvious place. I have experience from geocaching, that even if you know exactly (with ~10m precision) that something is there, it is often very difficult to find it, especially when it's something small. You should only be sure you'll remember where you have hidden it!
