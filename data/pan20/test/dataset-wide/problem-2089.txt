It's not your job to win SME over, or make him a champion of the process. At the end of the day, you just need the work done, or for his manager to assign someone else. Get it in writing, be polite, and don't involve his boss until it is apparent that he cannot or will not meet the deadline. Chances are, once he does it a few times, he will realize it's not so bad -- or maybe he'll suggest some genuinely helpful improvements on the next committee meeting. But at this point, you just need to get him (or someone) started. 

I know this probably isn't the outcome you were expecting, and you have disappointed expectations. However, moving forward, I see only upside to accepting their offer. True they may merge your teams, and possibly may bring in someone from outside. But refusing their offer will not prevent that; in fact, it will probably make it more likely. Their offer shows that they are undecided, and are willing to let you take the lead for a little while and try things out. It sounds like it is not impossible that they will make promotion permanent. And if they do merge teams and bring in a new manager, then at least you got management experience for a while, which will be an invaluable resume line-item if you ever apply for a management position in the future. And if you say no? I would say that sends a message, and excludes you from consideration for promotion for at least a few years (or longer). Also, you miss out on gaining a management perspective and experience. 

From one programmer to another: Don't overthink situations like this. It sounds like he was on a tight deadline (had probably promised to get back to someone) that's why he delegated. The fact that deadline was so tight means that he was just looking for a recommendation on MVP (minimum viable product), not looking for an intense market analysis of the perfect intersection of features and value. Asking questions made him load a lot of information into his brain -- the exact thing he was trying to avoid. To answer your question: 

Grow your "soft skills". Don't worry about the technical stuff. You've already got that. Get a degree in business management, leadership, finance, etc. something with a business heavy emphasis, and organizational administration skills. Bachelors degree is fine, doesn't have to be MBA. You can even start with Associate degree in business from local community college for like $100 per credit hour, and go from there. Seriously. If you want to be CTO of anything larger than a very small start up, then this is the path. If you want to remain a technician, then what you really want to be is an architect (solutions architect, software architect, etc), or an IT manager, software manager, IT Director, etc. But if you want to be CTO -- a business executive -- then you need soft skills. Or, alternately, spend 15-30 years in industry, have good luck, grow your people skills, read a lot of books, and maybe you'll get there. 

I would have the same inclination. This scheme is your baby. You thought about this for a year, researched it, learned enough about it to create documentation, and just dumped it in his lap. 

Based on your question and title, you are acting on some large assumptions. In reality, you don't know what ex-manager knows, if he is truly "potentially vengeful", nor do you know what he will ask you to do, or that he will require you to repeat your exit interview. In general, I don't like airing grievances in exit interview because it burns a bridge and can often complicate things for you in the future (ex: this whole situation). However, it's done. Close that chapter and move on. You do not have any duty to repeat your HR exit interview performance to ex-manager (and if he requires it, I would report that to HR as well). You can do so if a) you want the satisfaction of (finally) looking him in the eye and reciting his flaws, and b) you don't care if you get the job. A job interview is not the time to rehash this topic. My approach would be to avoid the exit interview topic altogether. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Don't lie, but don't confirm (or deny) anything relating to the exit interview. If he asks what you said in exit interview, simply say, "In my exit interview, I shared some candid reflections on my experience here in an overall positive conversation. I was not accusatory, nor did I directly seek to undermine you nor any other individual. I cannot begin to speculate on whether any of the things I said influenced HR in any way. I liked working here in the past, love my former colleagues, and enjoyed our working relationship. I would enjoy working together again." If he presses for details, I would simply say, "I am uncomfortable repeating anything I said in a confidential exit interview. I'd rather not talk about it." Maybe he will be satisfied, maybe he won't. But, personally, there is simply no-way I would rehash a confidential exit interview during a hiring interview with the same company. Especially not if you care (at all) about getting this job and / or avoiding burning bridges. 

I can see some value in sending these email blasts once a week, especially if it meets a diversity requirement. However, make sure you send in such a way that people can easily manage messages using rules. For example: 

Next time just accept his requirements at face value, and make 2-3 (max) recommendations based solely on those requirements. For example, If he's looking for a phone for salesmen, where they can access the company CRM, then recommend a couple of nice looking models with large screens (and who cares if the camera sucks; those guys don't need to take pictures (unless it's of themselves doing shots with clients)). If it is for building inspectors, then recommend something that is very sturdy, has a decent camera to document violations, and has a great antenna for remote locations, and don't worry about SD card reader or fast processor. If it's for a traveling exec, get something simple with a good FaceTime / Skype camera, and a leather case. I guess my point is, just take the requirements, make 2-3 (max) different recommendations at different price points that meet those requirements, and move on. Don't overthink.
