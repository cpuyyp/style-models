As late as WW1 there was very little literature surrounding PTSD/'shellshock'. In fact, the term was not coined until the 1980's. Considering the fact that warfare has been a part of human life since time immemorial, why is PTSD only being discussed about now? Did people of earlier eras not suffer PTSD as much since violence and death was a big part of their daily lives? 

I.e. equipment will be made in the satellites, shipped over to the USSR and become the property of the USSR without any chance to negotiate licenses or leases. Lastly, it seems that COMECON was involved in outright robbery through price gouging of fellow Warsaw Pact states: 

Through archives and doctrinal publications, was there any bias towards attacking NATO through the North German Plain, the Fulda Gap, or something else? 

Some sources mention Gordon running into the Austrian consulate to save himself from the Mahdi, which implies that there were other Europeans in Khartoum during the siege. What happened to them? 

Soldiers seem to be split into their respective companies or battalions but on the battlefield instead of presenting a complete front line they split up and leave gaps in the line between each battalion or company. Was it therefore not possible for a group of men to force themselves between this gap? I imagine this would be even easier in a pike formation where it is quite unwieldy to swing your pike around. Like this: 

I was always under the impression that the USSR had the advantage over NATO for much of the cold war until the 80's, when the stagnating Soviet economy hurt their weapons programs whist Reagan's militarization programs (M1 Abrams, Apache helicopters, Bradleys, Humvees, etc.) started getting deployed in Europe. However, reading this thread, especially posts by a user called 'ikalugin', suggests to me that the USSR has parity over NATO in pure technical terms anyway. Are there any truth to his claims, or is it just the almost universal Russian superiority complex? Some examples of superiority of USSR equipment outlined in the thread: -Late T-80 models being superior to M1A1 tanks and, by extension, other NATO MBT's -Late model T-64 being the same as T-80's therefore by extension they're better than NATO MBT's as well -Superiority of MIG-29 and SU-27 over F-15 as well as the Soviet pioneering of data links 

The Weygand Line I am referring to is the line established by Maxime Weygand in the aftermath of the hugely successful Fall Gelb. Immediately after the evacuation of Dunkirk, French soldiers were being repatriated back to France and presumably bringing back with them knowledge and expertise on the German's tactics. French military technology was also on a parity with the Germans, with better tanks (such as the Somua S.35) and artillery. Their lines were also anchored on the rivers Somme and Aisne. The advantages the Germans had was the number of divisions (142 vs Weygand's ~60) and the qualitative superiority of the Luftwaffe. Significant advantages, yet, it only took 3 weeks for the French army to utterly collapse. How did the French army collapse so quickly? Were the German advantages in numbers and air superiority that decisive? 

The answer is absolutely zero. The Belgae people of 50 BC and the Belgians of today are in all likelihood completely genetically different - the area was resettled by Romans, as you say, but also suffered (and most likely bred with) various different Germans, Goths, Huns, Magyars and finally Vikings before we reach somewhere resembling today's modern Belgians. If your question is "What have the people who have lived in the area conquered throughout history" then you could say the whole world (you did mention recursively) because the people in the region became French, Normans and Dutch, who then became other states like the UK, the USA, etc. Although by the 1400's no French, Norman English or Flemish king has ever sat on the throne of: 

Throughout history, Jews have almost always been persecuted in every culture they try to co-exist with. The act is so common that we even have a term for it - anti-semitism - even though semites aren't all Jewish. In other words, what did the Jews ever do throughout history to deserve all the hate? Of course, there is no simple answer which can be typed up in a few paragraphs. So I'm just looking for some broad, greatly summarized reasons to help me get a basic understanding of all the hatred. Note: I am not talking about Zionism or the actions of the state of Israel. Persecution of Jews go way back before the 20th century. 

Even if we account for the argument that it is much more tedious to train a man to use a bow than a musket, why then did the arbalest not make a comeback? Its effective range - reportedly at 300m, is still much better than a smoothbore musket from the 18th century and is probably more accurate as well. An army composed of 14th century arbalesters seem to have much more tactical options than an army of fusiliers, so why did the crossbow not make a comeback? 

The side effect, of course, was that these satellite states became heavily indebted to the USSR. Bulgaria for example had a -2 billion ruble account to the USSR by the time of the article's writing (I think 1981). COMECON also regularly pushed expenses off the USSR's accounts to their satellites: 

In the Battle of Crete in 1941, the numbers were around equal but the British have supremacy in the sea and in land equipment. The only advantage the Germans had was air supremacy. So why did the British surrender their forces? 

Now in the modern days, the phrase "lets settle this like men" would imply a fist fight. Yet as little as 200 years ago, "settling it like men" would either involve swords or pistols; the fist was the tool of the peasants and the lower class. When and how did it become socially unacceptable to use weapons to 'settle' accounts? 

I am looking for the Longbow itself being the decisive weapon, not the Longbow men, as was the case in Agincourt. This could mean some significant disadvantages to the enemy, including things like: the Longbows inflicted a high number of casualties or the Longbows being a strong force multiplier that it helped the English army win. I didn't include Agincourt because the Longbow was not the decisive factor IMO; it was the mud and the battlefield as a whole. 

I remember during the early-middle days of the Iraq War there were growing concerns on the need to reinstate conscription to shore up US troop numbers. Was there any legitimate concern behind this or was it just political/media fear-mongering? 

In his book "Tigers in the Mud", Otto Carius talks about his experiences in the western front (mostly spent inside the Ruhr Pocket) with great disdain. Some quotes: 

And besides British immigration, did the thirteen colonies see alot of immigration from other European states? 

I have heard the claim many times that most soldiers shoot to miss their enemy rather than kill. The most recent claim of this was on the TV show Black Mirror. Except for exceptional circumstances of fraternization such as the 1914 Christmas truce, did soldiers actually try to miss their shots, or are such claims apocryphal? 

To clarify the above answer: Siam ceased to be an absolute monarchy in 1932 and adopted a constitution in a (relatively) bloodless coup. The immediate effect of the coup was to give extraordinary amounts of power to the aristocracy and ranking officers, leading the country to be dominated by the military for the next 60 years. The country was renamed from 'Siam' to 'Thailand' in 1948, partly to appear more 'modernized', and partly because 'Siam' in the west is associated as a Japanese ally. Sources: I'm Thai and this is the history we were taught. 

It is fairly well documented that Napoleon's retreat from Moscow in 1812 was somewhat slowed by the large amounts of civilians following the army. My question is - where did these civilians come from and why did the Grand Army accommodate them? What happened to them when they were captured by the Russians? 

There are other disparaging remarks on the effectiveness of the American troops as well, in addition to sarcastic quotations of how fearful the American troops were. My question is, is this assessment fair? Was Otto's experience of Americans due to the fact that the units around the Ruhr pocket 1) did not expect much resistance due to the aforementioned "nobody was fighting anymore" and so was very casual with their pace, and 2) were of a lower quality as Bradley sent his crack units to race to the Elbe and Austria? 

This newspaper clipping from 1895 gives more information to the whereabouts of the Europeans in Khartoum. It states that "in 1887, the prisoners include four Italian sisters, 2 priests and 2 laymen".
