It's definitely not normal practice here in London for an employer to require an employee to pay anything at all before starting a new job. This is so unusual that you have either come across a remarkably stingy employer, or (more likely) this is a scam. Also, the thing they're asking you to pay for sounds like a load of nonsense: ISO 9001 is an accreditation which applies to organisations, not individual employees: 

This probably varies by region and culture, but here in the UK, you should leave out that statement. The normal assumption is that you have some referees - it's not something that needs to be stated. Stating it could make you look naive. 

By the way, I'd consider this kind of asserting of status by managers and senior team members fairly unusual - and somewhat dysfunctional - in a software engineering setting. For me it would be a red flag for an organisation that's maybe more bureaucratic and status-conscious and less delivery-focussed and meritocratic than it should be. That does vary by culture (around the world) though, and anyway it's essentially the CEO's problem rather than yours. 

Many companies - particularly in the tech sector - use puzzles of various kinds (including riddles, lateral-thinking questions, and guesstimation questions) in job interviews for potential new recruits. To what extent is this practice effective or ineffective? Is there any correlation between puzzle-solving performance and job effectiveness? If there is evidence of correlation, then for what types of roles? And what types of puzzles? And if (as I currently understand to be the case) there is little or no evidence to support the effectiveness of puzzle-based job interviews, then why do companies persist with this practice? Update: Thank you to everyone who has posted answers so far. Mostly what we have at the moment though is opinion, personal experience and anecdote - are there any actual data on this? I.e. studies? 

Instead, best to deal with the idea that they want to pay you to do nothing for 20 minutes once a week, simply in order to flatter their egos. It's not mature behaviour and it's not effective management, but you're not in a position to be able to point this out without doing yourself a disservice with the people in charge of you. And nobody likes a smartarse. So here's some options: 

"the sender knows I saw the letter almost immediately" - not true. Most productivity advice is about not checking emails all the time, but doing so only a few times per day, because email can seriously interrupt your "flow". And in fact, doing just this could solve your problem. As you note correctly, answering immediately will train your colleagues to expect immediate answers. So stop checking emails in real time, and people will learn to only contact you via email with stuff that is not completely time-critical. (Make sure you still get back to everyone within one business day, of course.) However, there of course still are time-critical things, and the productivity gurus who recommend checking emails only a few times per day argue correctly that anyone who really needs something urgent from you can pick up his phone and call you. So if you do go down that route, be prepared for people to call you. Think about turning your phone off if you need some uninterrupted time. 

This would really burn any remaining bridges. If you do decide to fight for this, then perhaps you might just as well tell people. However, check your employment contract first and see whether you promised not to share "sensitive information" or "company policy" unless there is a clear need-to-know. Be careful of giving the company additional legal ammunition they can use to neutralize your ammo. The company may not even be consciously screwing you over - possibly they think they made it abundantly clear that this was an incentive bonus, not a milestone bonus. There may be differences in interpreting communications on both sides. Bottom line: go see your lawyer, and think long and hard about whether the cash involved justifies burning bridges. 

The bad Well, it certainly can backfire. If you have previously interviewed with a firm, they will probably have that in your files, and if you rejected their offer, they will remember. They may believe that you interviewed just for practice (as here) or possibly even shared their offer with your current employer to negotiate salaries. The same goes double if you are extended an offer and start negotiating (maybe you also want to practice negotiating?), only to turn them down. The "target" firm will keep their final rejected offer in their files. Two years later, you might be happy to work under the offered conditions, but they know that you already turned that down once, so they will be less keen on spending more resources on you a second time, arguing that you will probably demand at least as much as you rejected last time. Also, your current employer may get wind of your interviewing. It's a small world, after all. I'd rather not explain to my manager that "it was all for practice, honest, I'm staying here." Will he believe me? Finally, this takes time. Tailoring your cover letter and resume is not instantaneous. Is the time spent worth it? The good Of course interviewing is a skill, so it makes sense to stay in shape. The "practice" argument is certainly valid. More importantly, during this practice, you may just be offered a position and/or salary/benefits package that simply is too good to pass on, even if you are happy where you are. You wouldn't have heard of this position/package without your practice interviews. Finally, you are making it known that you are on the market. So even if you are not offered something at a firm or reject the offer, people there will remember you (see above), and that can certainly be for the good. The next time an interesting position opens up, they may recall your stellar interview performance (due to all the practice ;-) and email you. The bottom line I personally don't like spending the time. With a job and a family, I'd honestly rather spend my little spare time at the gym than going to interviews. But your mileage may vary. EDIT: the ethics Other answers have addressed the ethical issue, and I should have, too. My bad. Here goes. Yes, wasting the interviewers' time is unethical, no doubt about that. But I don't think this is totally clear-cut. On the one hand, you would be "practice-interviewing" for positions that are not completely, utterly irrelevant to you, your situation in life and your career aspirations. Otherwise, either the firm won't invite you if you are an obvious mismatch to the position, or you wouldn't go to the interview or apply in the first place, because you couldn't learn anything from that interview. Therefore, even if you are happy in your current situation, there is a non-negligible chance that either of the cases under "The good" above occurs: you may get an offer that is honestly too good to pass up, or you at least make valuable contacts for later on (and contacts are always valuable for both sides). In either case, you wouldn't have completely wasted the interviewers' time. Conversely, even if you are searching for a job and go into an interview leaning towards accepting an (eventual) offer, you may learn during the interview that the firm and you are not a good match, and you may end up declining an offer. Would you say that you wasted the interviewers' time? I wouldn't. So: your propensity to accept an offer prior to an interview is rarely a 100% yes or no. How badly you really waste anyone's time is really a function of this a priori propensity. And yes, I do suggest keeping this in mind. "Is the nonzero chance of actually getting an offer I might seriously consider accepting, or of making mutually beneficial contacts worth everyone's time?" (Don't get me started on employers wasting people's time, because HR had a quota of number of interviews to fill for each position, either because of internal targets or because of backfiring legal requirements.) 

But if they're just going out for a drink and nobody is socially pressured to drink alcohol if they don't want to, then in most British workplaces this would be considered a good team-bonding thing to do. Be warned that if the employer is a foreign company then the implicit rules may be different - in particular, American firms can be a lot more puritan about this kind of thing. Whereas at a French firm (for example) the quality of the food and wine might be considered more significant than the alcohol content. 

BATNA Explained, The Negotiation Academy While you remain completely committed to staying with your current employer, your BATNA is worth exactly $0. Worth noting that developing a BATNA doesn't mean you have to actually leave the company, it just means you need to develop some other options, so you find out what you would be worth to other employers if you did decide to leave. 

Depends on what country/culture you and the person you're talking to are in. In an international business context where you don't know what festival the person you're talking to might be celebrating, "Happy Holidays" is a pretty safe bet. Or if you want to be less formulaic, something like "Enjoy the holidays, speak to you in the New Year!" It's generally safest to avoid the assumption that the person you're talking to is or ought to be a member of any specific religion - and certainly avoid giving the impression that you think their religious festivals are inferior or invalid compared to yours - and for those reasons I'd generally avoid the mention of a specific religious festival until I know which one they celebrate (or until I know they're just not bothered about that kind of thing). 

"Hi - any decision yet from last month's interview? Or any idea when you'll be letting me know? Thanks!" 

First discuss it (in private) with the Chair. It should be part of their role to ensure that 'airtime' in the meetings isn't dominated by one person. If there's a discriminatory aspect to this - if person X is dominating the meeting because they perceive themselves to be superior to the other participants or more entitled to speak because of their gender, race, etc versus that of the other participants - then this applies even more. On the other hand, it is possible for people to do this - dominate the 'airtime' of a meeting - without really intending to, particularly if they're very enthusiastic about their contribution. They might (perhaps) not realise that they're denying other people the opportunity to speak - so a good first option might be for the Chair to have a quiet word with them in private (outside of the meetings). 

Basically, going the freelancer way may be the thing for you if you have a strong network and are recognized as an expert in your field. If there are clients calling you specifically, and if you can actually tell them to wait for four weeks while you recuperate on Hawaii and they actually wait for you, you are probably all set for this type of career. 

So, also taking @Spehro's points into account, I would advise you to not use company resources, go to your manager rather earlier than later, and making it clear that you are not committing to anything, nor are you responsible for the quality of the end product. Clarify what you will and what you won't do. If there are aspects you won't enjoy (QA, documentation, support, bugfixing), be clear upfront what you won't do but offer to do those things on company time if requested. 

Talk to your manager. Explain that you love working at that company but that you recently moved and that the commute may impact your productivity. Lay the facts on the table - showing that you did your homework will make a very good impression. Don't be aggressive and threaten to resign if you can't telecommute. First, nobody likes to be pressured, and least of all probably your manager. Second, you can always up the ante if your first polite request is turned down. Third, they may agree to your request... but you will likely be labeled as a "troublemaker". Add this to the fact that your network will definitely suffer from telecommuting, and then imagine what happens to unconnected troublemakers if the company decides to cut costs. Better strategy: be nice and cooperative. If you don't get what you want, update your CV and look for an alternative closer to your new home. If you have an offer, you can still go back to your manager and negotiate from a position of strength. 

No matter how you spin this, it will leave a bad feeling. You need to both do damage control and address underlying issues. 

On the other hand, if you are an important employee, putting your manager on notice that you are thinking of leaving might even get him to think about how he could retain you. So in this case, requesting a Zwischenzeugnis might even be beneficial. (Maybe not in your specific situation.)
