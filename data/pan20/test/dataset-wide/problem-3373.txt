Campbell (2004: 36) gives the OE form of 'thunder' as þunrian (though whether this OE form or the other is considered shouldn't affect the explanation), and indicates the addition of the stop consonant to be an example of excrescence, along with þy:mel > thimble. Note that in both examples the excrescent stop follows a nasal consonant and precedes an oral sonorant. The transition from a nasal consonant to an oral sonorant requires a velum-raising gesture and an obstruction-releasing gesture to happen more or less at the same time. The production of a voiced stop following a nasal consonant happens naturally and spontaneously if the obstruction-releasing gesture lags the velum-lowering gesture just a little bit. It may also be of anecdotal interest to note that in a number of languages (e.g., Korean, some Amazonian languages) what are described as nasal consonants may be pronounced as either nasals, voiced stops or prenasalized voiced stops.

3a should be read as follows: a constituent C' (a "complementizer phrase", e.g., English ...that I should come home.) may be rewritten as C0 (a "complementizer", e.g., English that), followed by IP ("inflectional phrase", i.e., a finite clause, e.g., I should come home.). 3b states that the order of the complementizer and the finite clause are reversed. Just to give one or two possibly relevant references: see Kornai & Pullum (1990) for a sort of technical, but thorough introduction to different versions phrase structure grammar. See Dryer (2008) on the issue of branching direction theory. 

I think that source-filter theory is the major theory in the field of acoustic phonetics. Current textbooks on voice production and phonetics (e.g. Stevens 1998; Titze 2000) make use of the theory, and do not mention any radically different alternatives. Source-filter theory is based on the same general mathematical framework that is used in signal processing research and control theory, fields which are highly developed with numerous practical applications. The method is more or less as follows [contributors with better math/engineering background feel free to edit this part]: the Laplace transform of an observed signal is treated as the product of a Laplace-transformed (actually occurring or ideal) input signal and one or more transfer functions (see the Wikipedia article for details). i.e., 

In the accompanying text to chapter 81, Dryer notes that some languages are treated as lacking a dominant order because two different word orders are conditioned by syntactic factors. German and Dutch are thus treated as lacking a dominant word order because main clauses containing an auxiliary have SOV order, while main clauses without an auxiliary have SVO order. (In languages where two different word orders are conditioned by the main/subordinate clause distinction, the language is assigned the value found in main clauses) To take another example, Idoma (Nigeria) is treated as lacking a dominant order because (according Dryer's source, Abraham 1951: 18) in the past tense the object may come either before or after the verb. I suspect that a modern-day analyst might try to investigate whether the word order difference in terms of information structure (where the form with the object before the verb would show focus on the verb rather than on the object). When certain word orders can be tied to focus-like properties, Dryer does not treat these as competing for dominant order (they are said to be "pragmatically marked"). Aghem (Cameroon), for example, is treated as SVO because even though various word orders are attested, Dryer's source (Watters 1979) gives detailed arguments for why word order changes are tied to focus. Since the non-SVO orders are all "pragmatically marked," they are treated as non-dominant orders, and the language is treated as being SVO-dominant. Like a main clause/subordinate clause split, word order changes conditioned by a polarity split also do not appear to cause a language to be treated as lacking a dominant order. Leggbo (Nigeria), Bafut and Mbili (both Cameroon) are treated as SVO-dominant, even though they have non-SVO word orders in negated clauses (see chapter 144C). Apparently, negated clauses are also treated as "pragmatically marked." 

I am looking for any recent studies dealing substantially with "broken vowels," or vocoid elements which have a noticeably nonstable formant trajectory, yet for which there are no good phonological arguments that they are diphthongs. "Broken vowels" might alternately be referred to as vowels with an "offglide" or "onglide". To give an example, in the dialect of Vietnamese spoken around Cần Thơ, open syllables whose vowel is represented by an orthographic i or y are pronounced approximately with a vowel sounding like [ɨi], so mì 'wheat noodles' is pronounced approximately [mɨi]. Orthographic o, on the other hand, is pronounced more or less like [ɑ], so mỏ 'snout' is pronounced [mɑ]. It is difficult to argue that [ɨi] is really a combination of [ɨ] and [i], because there are no open-syllable words having nuclear vowel [ɨ], and none having [i]; there is also no difference in vowel length between mì and mỏ. Anyways, let's try not to quibble over the this specific example more than necessary... 

Insofar as the status of head directionality as a binary parameter is considered to be an empirical hypothesis, it is false as an absolute universal. So you are not missing anything. Uniform head directionality, however, is a bidirectional statistical universal. VO word order is highly predictive of prepositions, and prepositions are highly predictive of VO word order. And vice versa. For data on the correlations between verb-object and noun-adposition word orders in 1142 languages, see Dryer 2011. If, however, you would rather not reject the parametric head directionality hypothesis, you can claim that something else is going on in the languages which fail to adhere to the word order correlations. Baker and Kramer 2011, for example, argue that prepositions in Amharic (which has OV word order) are not really prepositions, but case markers. But the more you indulge in the "it's not really a post/preposition" gambit, the more strict head directionality turns into an analytical principle rather than a testable hypothesis. 

It is possible to find categories corresponding to nouns and verbs in different languages, but the approach will be a sophisticated version of the traditional grammar view. The prototypical noun is a referring expression (whence "person, place, thing"), and the prototypical verb is a predicating expression (whence "action"). It is then usually possible to pick out morphosyntactic properties associated with referring constructions and predicating constructions. But there are many languages where predicating and referring constructions do not always clearly distinguish two classes of words (i.e. "nouns" can also predicate, "verbs" can also refer). (Van Valin 2008 gives examples of this type of behavior from Nootka and Tagalog) However, it will be possible to find other types of constructions which can assist with the sorting. For example, I might find a language where an intransitive predicating construction does not make the distinction between nouns and verbs, but a transitive predicating construction does. Therefore, if you know roughly which types of word classes you are looking for, it is usually possible to pick out the right constructions that will give you the formal basis for distinguishing the desired number of word classes. Since the procedure is somewhat subjective, linguists will end up disagreeing on, say, whether a language has adjectives, since those who want adjectives can keep looking until they find the construction that distinguishes adjectives from intransitive verbs. 

As for (1), Heine & Kuteva (2002: 333) name seven frequent grammaticalization sources for the concept of OBLIGATION. These are COPULA, DO, GET, NEED, OWE, H-POSSESSIVE, SUITABLE. (An H-possessive is "a marker of predicative possession expressed, for example, in English by have". (ibid.: 163)). So let's take it on their authority that it is frequent cross-linguistically for have-like verbs to end up expressing obligation. The fact that ter is, or is related to, a verb helps us to explain why this particular construction has to involved two linked clauses: a matrix clause containing the verb ter, and an embedded clause describing the obliged action. On a side note, use of Latin habere does actually show up in this sense. (See towards the bottom of the CNRTL entry for avoir). The quote from Varro that is cited is "rogas ut id mihi habeam curare" So, why is an infinitive used in the embedded clause? Here we can note that cross-linguistically, constructions involving two linked clauses often have a pivot-controller relation (see Van Valin 2005: ch.4) holding between arguments of the two clauses. An argument of one clause which is expressed (the "controller") is understood to be coreferential with an unexpressed argument (the "pivot") of another clause. Since the person who is obliged to do an action is normally the one who is doing the action, it makes sense for this construction to have a pivot--controller relation where the subject of the matrix clause will be the same as the subject of the embedded clause. The relevant property of the infinitive is that it is not marked for its subject; this is fine since it is unnecessary to indicate the subject. (I don't speak Portuguese, but I am guessing that you couldn't use one of the personal infinitives in place of the regular infinitive in this construction) Why que instead of some other subordinator? My partial guess is that because the construction probably developed from one with similar meaning, but where ter has an object, e.g. "Tenho trabalho que fazer", it will just take the subordinator from that construction. Note that in French, for example, which has a similar construction avoir à + INF, the relevant form with an object for avoir uses à to introduce the infinitive: "j'ai ce travaille à faire".
