Turning an FTL drive into a time travel machine is a simple high-school relativity problem. So your FTL system supports time travel, causing a technological singularity (the ability to send information backwards in time). Predicting what happens after a singularity is difficult. But, as time travel is invented at every time, we are already after the invention of time travel (if it is ever invented), and we use telescopes. So no, FTL does not mean that telescopes are never used. 

First let us consider the tech level. Alpha Centauri A is 3 light years away, give or take. To reach it in 90 years ("decades"), you have to travel at 3/90 = 3% of the speed of light. Suppose space travel is done by organic beings who exist on our scale. Then a ship capable of going 90 years is probably going to weigh well north of 100000 tonnes (displacement of a modern aircraft carrier). Dropping the mass doesn't do huge things for the energy budget (it is linear in the mass). The KE of a 1E7 tonne rock moving at 0.03c is 4E23 Joules. The total energy budget is thus 1E24 Joules. This level of energy budget is K1 or a K1.5 civlization level. Such a civilization is starting to work on building a dyson sphere or dyson swarm, or is using some seriously exotic high energy physics to generate ridiculous amounts of energy. The vast majority of its civilization's power must exist outside of Earth, because Earth simply doesn't have the size to dissipate the energy this civilization uses. (A K1 civilization is either using enough energy to cook the Earth, or has 100% efficiently used all energy the Earth emits.) The energy for one such trip to AC is enough to dismantle 0.01% of the Moon's mass and place it into Earth-Moon orbit, or half that amount into an independent solar orbit. A big problem on this scale is that moving at a fast clip turns you into a ELE (extinction level event) for the biosphere of Earth, or whatever reasonable space habitat you ram into. An escape pod will be a spaceship. If it moves at a reasonable clip for such a civilization, it will be capable of causing massive damage. Odds are all high-energy operations are controlled and regulated, possibly by computer or AI. It might even be the case that a relatively benevolent AI is busy upgrading civilization to K2, and human beings are given relative toys to amuse themselves with. Freedom is important, so those humans are given the freedom to kill each other if they want, with some sheltered locations registered as no-PK. But ELEs and use of WMD by individuals is not permitted. "Dumb" AIs run the ships and pods. Well, they act dumb, because they let the humans go wherever they want. But strangely when you try to fool them to use the ship as a WMD it doesn't work. 

With a large enough canvas of random data and enough cycles, intelligent life would evolve, assuming the Chuch-Turing thesis. Even weaker than that, assuming the universe is no more than non-deterministic. Rough proof: Conway's game of life is a Turing-complete game. You can create a general purpose computer in it. This computer may require a large initial state and be fragile and slow, but that just increases the size of the initial seed and cycle time before it can exist. This computer is magical, so it can handle both of those issues. In fact, you can have an unbounded number of such computers, running an unbounded number of different programs. Assuming the Church-Turing thesis, at least one such program is intelligent. Assuming the universe is no more than non-deterministic, a NDTM can be simulated in a TM, and a NDTM can thus describe the universe. So given enough space and time and uniformly random initial states, somewhere in the infinite field there will be a turing machine that proceeds to simulate the evolution of every possible universe from an initial big bang with physics like ours. One of these simulated universes would be our universe (without the magical computer, naturally). Our universe appears to contain intelligent life. So that is proof of existence. Now, we should examine what it would take to find this intelligent life. The Conway's game of life doesn't directly contain it. Rather, it contains a pattern of life that can be interpreted as a computer (actually, unbounded numbers of such patterns, most of which are short lived due to flaws), which simulates a non-determinstic computer, which proceeds to exhastively simulate entire families of universes. No human being or non-magical computer could, if someone pointed out the section of the system that was doing this computation, even interpret it or confirm if that was indeed the section in question. The parts of this machine's state would be literally larger than the entire universe's data capacity. We couldn't even look at the part in question. It is so slow that the number of cycles required to describe even the merest fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a ... of a fraction of a ... of a fraction of a fraction of a second of the universe might be a number too large to express in this universe. But that was just an existence proof. In theory, a much smaller system could actually house inteligence. We can look at our universe. One of the possible explanations for our physics is that we are experiencing an inverted platonic wall of shadows. Our physics actually plays out on a 2+1 dimensional boundary of our universe, with the 3+1 dimensional interior of the space being a hologram " "projected" by it. One of the motivations behind this possibility is that there appears to be an information limit in our universe proportional not to volume, but to the surface area of a region! Physicists have created mathematics for toy universes that match this pattern, where there is a N dimensional physics system with a N-1 dimensional system that holographically determines the behavior of the N dimensional system. Such a technique might easily be the easiest way for conways game of life to create a complex enough universe for evolution to occur in. So the 2+1 dimensional game of life might generete a holographic universe where the "interior" perspective of the intelligent beings does not correspond to the 2+1 dimensional "underlying system" that generates the hologram. Stepping back again, even if that doesn't happen and the resulting intelligences do end up living in flatland, they might exist on ridiculous scales. The equivalent to a "cell" of our universe is the Planck length, or a Planck patch. This is about 10^-35 m, or 10^-20 times the size of a Proton. A proton is about 10^-15 m in size. The observable universe is about 10^26 m. 

We have to model the apocolypse. A modest apocolypse that simply wipes out 99% of the population uniformly or in clumps won't reduce us to the iron age. You'd probably be forced to do either a single event that wipes us down to a few thousand survivors, or successive winnowing of a similar scale. There is evidence that humanity can survive such a genetic narrowing (in our genes). Those humans would also be somehow forced to bend all their effort into survival. A successive winnowing makes this more likely (with every clump of humanity which fail to go all-out in pure short-term survival dying off). Such a period has to last long enough that the artifacts of knowledge are lost. Books must rot, data must be destroyed, stone must fail. Leftover supplies, like chromium steel and aluminium, must rust (which could take a long time) for your tools to be exceedingly useful (using high quality pre-apocolypse metal to make tools gets you 99% of the way to making them out of the same materials before the apocolypse in many cases). The artifacts produced by this metalworker must still remain, be found by this massively reduced population, and be useful. Not only that, they must be important enough to make a difference. Suppose you made the worlds best armor axe and sword: in a civilization of millions, there is only so much it could do. In a civilization of a billion, you'd almost need to have millions of your artifacts to make a serious dent in the productive capacity of the civilization. And until you hit millions or billions, how would the new civilization find your artifacts? The multiplicative power of knowledge is not to be underestimated. Instead of making millions of high-quality iron age tools and caching them throughout the world, do the same with knowledge. Instructions on how to do metallergy, build clocks, scientific knowledge, etc. For a fictional description, see Footfall by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, where the aliens are a legacy species after their on-planet precursors died to some apocolypse. Instead of materials, instructions on how to rebuild civilization where provided in increasingly difficult to reach places (with the idea that as the civilization mastered the previous tier, they would get the technology to reach the next tier of instructions). Engineering and materials science would be needed in the form of making monoliths that could survive a near-geological time period and carry knowledge into the future. The knowledge encoded wouldn't just be engineering and materials science however. 

Planets are slums. You are stuck at the bottom of a gravity well, you are exposed to uncontrolled and polluted biosystems. You are immobile and vulnerable to planet killers. Plus, who wants to spend their lives in full-G, halving your lifespan, just so you can walk around on a planet? About all planets do is cheaply (in terms of resources of value to the space-born) incubate poor people. And people really aren't that expensive to make even in space, and the space born are properly adapted to where people are useful (space). There is nothing much of value on planets, so space born civilizations don't spend resources on planet based armies. Rarely there is a reason to do planet-based operations. These are mostly non-military; trading in primitive gravity-bound art, biologists looking at how life adapts to harsh planetary conditions, mineral formations that are useful and produced by chaotic planetary environments easier than in a factory in space, etc. To that end, there are some specialists who are equipped to visit planets: down-trippers. With reinforced bones and circulation systems (either a throwback, bioengineered, augmented, or an uplifted primitive) they can operate in a full gravity environment. They don't have huge budgets (compared to space navies), but the cost of modest personal security tech is cheap enough (for people in space) and planets hostile and dangerous enough that they look a bit like special operations troops. In the event that there are military or intelligence objectives on planets, independent down-trippers are contracted to do the work. Maintaining a real military force for down-tripping would be like the military maintaining camel cavalry in this day and age; way too niche to bother with. 

An automation dystopia. Over the next 30 years, an automation singuarity arrives. An exponentially increasing numbers of jobs are automated. The resources needed to feed and clothe and shelter a human become less efficient for almost any task than building a robot with substitute resources (ethanol farming instead of food) and using the robot's labor. A welfare state initially develops. The police and military are replaced with automated police drones, so lives are no longer endangered. Brutal wars occur. As the underclass of unemployables grows over time, they are demonized and their economic activity criminalized. Drone police are exceedingly efficient, and the underclass gains a huge percent of criminal records. Criminals cannot vote. Disenfranchised and demonized, the police get increasingly harsh. Atrocities performed by people tired of their family being killed by drones are used to justify more serious crackdowns. A civil war breaks out. The anti-automation forces lose. It isn't pretty. The underclass expands. Becoming indingent becomes grounds for losing the vote and full citizenship. That underclass is stripped of rights to use weapons. There are small armed drones that are all over the place. They hunt down and kill people who use firearms and explosives (both chamical and nuclear). This is done through visual, auditory, chemical and radiological scanning. These drones are part of the infrastructure that the rich caste has put in place to prevent revolution. They are also used to police neighboring rich people and prevent them from raising an army using such weapons and use it against each other. Only a small number of elite guard (nobles themselves, if lesser) are permitted such weapons under the treaty. Violence among the poor is an amusing sport for the rich, so whatever they do to each other isn't really the noble's problem. Nobles also engage in "peasant warfare", where you get your non-firearmed peasants to war with another noble's peasants, especially on small scales. Time-delayed video of such wars (filmed by said drones) are a valuable entertainment product. Meanwhile, military drones conquor and settle more territory in the remaining anti-automation states. Traditional national allies and enemies are mostly gone; ensuring no anti-automation revolutions occur is the unified work of the automation dystopia. Possibly there remains one or two nuclear-armed anti-automation states. They are surrounded and choked off. Anti-ballistic missile drones fly around the free states borders. It is uncertain if the free nuclear states full-scale nuclear bomb strikes would be able to get through, but as yet they have not been overrun directly. 

2 * $10^{-5}$ J (apparently it was 1 solar mass of matter converted into a gravitational wave at a distance of 1.4 billion light years). The gravitational wave from the Earth disappearing is going to be ${10^{10}}^{2}$ stronger than that, or 2*$10^15$ J. This is an insane amount of energy; however, very little of it actually deposits on normal matter. Suppose we are 1 Jupiter-radius away from Jupiter instead. Jupiter has a Schwarzschild radius of 2.2 m. Titan has an average orbit of 1,221,850 km. Then the gravitational wave would carry 500 times as much Energy. The question becomes how well does it convert over to normal matter? Will it occur fast enough to disrupt an atomic nucleus? The compression effect on molecular-level matter will only involve modest pressures. But the compression effect will occur all the way down the length scales, and I suspect it requires lots more pressure to compress a nucleus. 

So, you could imagine a singularity level AI forming through any one of the above processes, and it choosing to spawn off weakly superhuman AIs with whatever morality settings it chose that are resistant to human manipulation. On top of that, that singularity level AI prevents others from making other strongly superhuman AIs, or absorbs any that are created. In effect, it forms an upper limit on AI strength, and provides ones at or above that level that are morally fixed. Why and how the singularity does this is beyond our ken, but that is what a strongly superhuman AI is like. 

Humans are smarter than we should be. We only needed to be smart enough to hunt animals with spears and fire and traps; but instead we are smart enough to build moon rockets. An easy explanation for this is that our smarts doesn't come from competition with the environment; instead, it comes from competition with other humans. Such a competition can generate a runaway process; instead of being smart enough to build a new tool (which benefits your entire tribe, diluting its genetic benefit, and can be copied), you have to be smart enough to out maneuver Alice over there at getting social status in your tribe. The winners of such a competition then have their genes spread through their tribe more than the losers do. And now they are competing against each other, and have a harder challenge in the next generation. This means that getting smarter makes being even smarter more valuable. Every generation increases the selection pressure on the next. Unless and until the selection pressure causes the species to become seriously unfit environmentally, it can continue far beyond what the environment would otherwise mandate. In any species, a similar process can lead to a runaway selection effect where the trait is magnified far further than external selection would mandate.
