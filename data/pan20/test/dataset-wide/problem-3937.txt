For every $m\in\mathbb{N}_+$, $k=0,\dots,m-1$, denote $I_{m,k}:=(\frac{k}{m},\frac{k+1}{m})$. Denote $W = H^1(S^1,\mathbb R^{2n})$ = The Hilbert space of $C^1$ maps maps $v(t)$ from the circle to $\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v$ and $\dot v$ in $L^2$. We will think of those maps as maps $v\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v(0)=v(1)$. Consider the spaces: \begin{eqnarray*} W_m &:=& W\cap\{v\in H^1([0,1],\mathbb R^{2n}):\text{$v|_{I_{m,k}}$ is linear}\} \end{eqnarray*} Consider the projection $P$ from $W$ to $W_m$. Does $P$ have a kernel in the sense of convolution operator or Hilbert-Schmidt operator? Is there a closed formula? (This is reminiscent of the situation in Fourier series, where the projection onto the space of truncated Fourier sums is a convolution with Dirichlet Kernel) Thanks 

I have a sequence $X_0,X_1,\ldots$ of Abelian groups, along with face maps $d_0,\ldots, d_n: X_{n-1}\to X_n$ which satisfy the standard cosimplicial identities EXCEPT at the very bottom, where in $\mathrm{Hom}(X_0, X_2)$, I have $$d_2d_0 \ne d_0d_1$$ However, I have one extra map $d_\infty:X_1\to X_2$ which satisfies the following relations in $\mathrm{Hom}(X_0,X_2)$ $$ d_\infty d_0 = d_2d_0 $$ $$ d_\infty d_1 = d_0d_1 $$ and the following relations in $\mathrm{Hom}(X_1,X_3)$ $$ d_0d_\infty = d_1d_\infty $$ $$ d_2d_\infty = d_3d_\infty $$ By hand, I can build a chain complex out of $X_\cdot$, adding a $d_\infty$ to the usual cosimplicial differential. The relations above imply that $d^2=0$. 

To answer Chris' (and maybe Ian's) question: The map that Charles describes is nontrivial for q=3 in the cases $G=Z^3, M=Z$ and $G=(Z/2)^3, M=Z/2$, the latter answering the original question (if Charles is right). The proof is easy since the cohomology rings are polynomial, respectively exterior, algebras. 

There is a simple way to understand the implication "geometric implies algebraic homotopy" if you remember that $\Omega^*(M \times I)$ is the (projective) tensor product of $\Omega^*(M)$ and $\Omega^*(I)$ of chain-complexes. Take the chain map $Int:\Omega^*(I) \to C^*(I)$ given by integration, where $C^*(I)$ is the simplicial cochain complex of the 1-simplex $I$ (of total dimension 3). Then a geometric homotopy, composed with $Int$ gives a chain map $$ \Omega^*(N) \to \Omega^*(M) \otimes C^*(I)$$ Unravelling this map into its 3 components, corresponding to the two 0-simplices and the 1-simplex of $I$, you get a triple $(f^*,g^*,\eta)$ which is precisely an algebraic homotopy. It's very hard to go back since an algebraic homotopy is very weak information, it exists if and only if $f$ and $g$ induce the same map on de Rham cohomology (since these are chain complexes over a field). One thing to do is to pull back the dga structure on $\Omega^*(I)$ to an $A_\infty$-structure on $C^*(I)$ via $Int$ (and a choice of a homotopy inverse). Instead of just an algebraic homotopy, you could then require an $A_\infty$ map $$ \Omega^*(N) \to \Omega^*(M) \otimes C^*(I)$$ which extends your given pair $(f^*,g^*)$ on the boundary (note that by construction, an example comes from a geometric homotopy). If $M$ and $N$ are nilpotent, this should guarantee a homotopy on the "realifications" by rational (or better: real) homotopy theory. For example, this should detect the Hopf maps between spheres but none of their suspensions (since these are torsion). 

For an $A_\infty$-category $\mathcal A$, one defines the group $K_0(\mathcal A)$ by $$K_0(\mathcal A) := \mathbb Z \operatorname{Ob} \operatorname{Tw} \mathcal A / \left<[A]+[B]-[C]\right>$$ Where 1) $Tw$ is the twisted complexes category (a way of formally adding all cones, see, $URL$ section 3.2 for an exposition by Auroux.) 2) The relations are $[A]+[B]-[C]=0$ when $C$ is quasi-isomorphic to a cone of a closed degree 1 morphism $A\to B$ Can one somehow relate $K_0(\mathcal A)$ to $K_0(Fun_{A_\infty}(\mathcal A, \mathcal A))$, i.e. the $K_0$ of the $A_\infty$-category of $A_\infty$-endofunctors? Thanks 

$\mathbb Z$ acts on the lattice $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ by adding an element to itself n times. I am studying some function arising from symplectic geometry which happens in my case to be naturally defined on $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ and is constant on each orbit of the $\mathbb Z$-action, thus it lives ob the orbit space. I am curious what kinds of algebraic/geometric/arithmetic structures does this set or orbits has, to compare with the behaviour of my function. Thanks 

Here are two answers, depending on what you mean by $\times$, which was not clear to me from your wording. 

Here are two answers to this question based on different interpretations of the meaning of ``Koszul.'' One reasonable way to define things is that Koszul duality depends not only on algebraic data (operad, modular operad, algebra, whatever) but also on a presentation of the algebraic data. This is both elegant and a bit of a cheat. For example, in algebras, operads, or properads (let me just say operad for simplicity), take the "maximal" presentation of your operad. That is, take all operations as generators and then all relations of the form [(infinitesimal) composition of two generators] = [first generator] composed with [second generator]. Then the Koszul dual is precisely the bar construction. So you've totally diluted the meaning of Koszul duality by allowing every operad to have a "Koszul" presentation which doesn't tell you anything new. But I think if you're a homotopy theorist, this is a pretty reasonable definition. On the other hand, maybe you want something more rigid or more amenable to calculation. So let's start over. One motivation for Koszul duality for an operad $P$ is that you have a canonical (large) resolution of $P$, the cobar bar resolution $\Omega B P\to P$ but you'd like something smaller if you can get it without losing the simplicity of the differential. Typically you hope that your resolution will be of the form $\Omega P^!$ for some cooperad $P^{!}$ (these exclamation points should be upside down but I can't figure out how). If $P^!$ has no differential of its own, this will be the unique-up-to-isomorphism minimal model for $P$. So one natural candidate is for $P^!$ to be the homology of $BP$. This inherits cooperadic structure from $BP$ and as such lives in the right category to apply the cobar functor $\Omega$. However, there are three problems. The first one, which is serious, is that we don't know that $BP$ is formal, i.e., quasi-isomorphic to its homology not just linearly but as a cooperad. Typically the homology will have to be given higher homotopy cooperations and then there's no hope for $\Omega H_*(BP)$ to be a resolution of $P$. But maybe you get lucky and you can construct this quasi-isomorphism. The second problem is computing this homology. In the classical definition of Koszul duality for operads, you don't take $H_*(BP)$ as a definition, you take one particular linear summand of $H_*(BP)$ which is easy to compute, based on a grading that comes from a quadratic presentation. Then you cross your fingers and hope this summand exhausts the homology. So say it does. The third problem, which is not such a big deal, is that $\Omega$ doesn't preserve all quasi-isomorphisms. In practice you can use the same grading on $BP$ that passes to its homology to ensure that this is one of the good quasi-isomorphisms preserved by $\Omega$. So let's try to mimic this in modular operads. Define $P^!$ as the homology of the Feynman transform (in this paragraph the exclamation point should not be upside down because of the dual involved in the Feynman transform), and call P Koszul if $P^!$ and the Feynman transform of $P$ are weakly equivalent as modular operads. As you point out, it's not obvious what quadratic means in this context, so let's skip the second problem altogether. Then it should be an exercise to ensure that even though you haven't used the grading of a homogeneous presentation, in most (all?) cases of interest, the Feynman transform preserves quasi-isomorphisms so we get the desired behavior from $P^!$, that it generates the minimal model for $P$. 

Hello, I am looking for a source that discusses and teaches hyperbolic geometry from a synthetic approach (As opposed to the common analytinc approach in the poincare disk). I am looking for something more in spirit with eucld's elements or hilbert's geometry book. Thank you 

I will present my question in the specifics I encountered it, so maybe some of the details are irrelevant for the desired conclusion. Consider $(S^2\times S^2,\omega_{std})$ the product of two spheres with standard product symplectic structure. $L\subset M$ is a Lagrangian torus in M. Given a family $\omega_s$ of forms, such that $\omega_0=\omega_{std}$ Choose $J_s$ an almost complex structure compatible with $\omega_s$. (which we are allowed to choose generically). Let $u_s$ be a family of Maslov 2 discs with boundary on $L$, converging to some bubbled curve $v$. Is there something I can say about the shape of the limit curve? The best case scenario would be a statement "If $J_s$ is generic, then the limit consists of two discs, one of Maslov 2 and the other of Maslov 0" I think I can rule out sphere bubbles by area considerations (A sphere in $S^2\times S^2$ has more area than the original disc), But as for discs I don't know how this works. Can I get in the limit discs with negative Maslov? Discs with Maslov $\ge 4$? a lot of Maslov 0 discs? Thank you very much 

The natural starting point of this story are E-orientations on, say closed, manifolds M. That's just a fundamental class $[M^n] \in E_n(M)$ such that cap product induces a (Poincare duality) isomorphism. Given E, the question becomes which M are E-orientable. In many cases it happens that this follows if the stable normal bundle of M admits a lift through a fibration $X\to BO$. For example, if E=HZ is ordinary Z-cohomology then X=BSO works, if E=KO then X=BSpin works, if E=KU then X=BU or X=BSpin$^c$ works etc. To formalize the idea that every X-manifold has an E-orientation, form the bordism groups $\Omega^X_n$ of X-manifolds and observe that the fundamental classes lead to natural maps $\Omega^X_n(Y) \to E_n(Y)$ for any space Y. In other words, there are natural transformations of cohomology theories $\Omega^X \to E$, or even better, maps of spectra $MX \to E$, where $MX$ is the Thom spectrum associated to the fibration $X\to BO$. In the case X=BU this is called a complex orientation of E and has been studied extensively because it simplifies computations of E-cohomology tremendously. The original and still relevant reference is Adams' little blue book. 

Let $X$ be a semisimplicial set (face maps but no degeneracy maps). Fix a positive integer $k$. Let $Y_n$ be $X_{(n+1)k}$ and then define $\partial^Y_i:Y_n\to Y_{n-1}$ by $$\partial^Y_i = (\partial^X_{ik})^k.$$ These maps give $Y$ the structure of a semisimplicial set. There are many variations possible on this theme, changing the indexing numbers around. I'm not only interested in this particular example, but in any similar semisimplicial set created using iterated face maps of a semisimplicial set. Has this construction or similar ones been studied? Does it have a name? Any obvious properties? Is there a variation with a straightforward or canonical extension to simplicial sets? Are there interesting variations where $\partial_0$ and $\partial_n$ are perturbed or different in some way? If there is something interesting that can only be said in a linear category that would also be of interest. 

Hambleton and I found topological 4-manifolds N for which the intersection form is not extended from the integers, in particular 2 doesn't hold. With Friedl and Melvin we showed later that our examples don't have a smooth structure. But now I remember a discussion with Fintushel and Stern who mentioned that they constructed a smooth counterexample to 2 (and hence to the conjecture). 

S is null homotopic in M via Poincare duality and the exact sequence of the pair. S bounds an embedded 3-ball in M if and only if N can be decomposed into $S^1 \times S^3$, connected sum with a simply connected manifold.
