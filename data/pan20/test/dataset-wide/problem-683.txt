But I'm not sure quite how you could make an error mixing sugar, salt and water. If you can't get it all to dissolve, add more water. If you can't taste it, add more powder. It's not rocket surgery. Also, I often get my salt from hot chips, because when I'm cycle touring I generally have lunch in town and buy take-away chips (they're called fries in the US, I believe). That gets me cheap fat, starch and salt in one tasty package (because on long tours I also burn a lot of energy so cheap calories are all good). I would rather each junk food than buy energy drinks, even in town. 

Yes, it's common. Many low rider racks come with oversize U bolts specifically for this purpose, and the better ones bolt on to the brake posts like the Old Man Mountain rack shown below. If you're really lucky your suspension fork will have mounts for standard low-rider racks already (that's very rare though). 

You should only need to replace the sprocket, nothing else. If you put on a smaller sprocket to get higher gearing/slower pedalling you need a smaller sprocket, not a larger one. You may need to remove a chain link. Those parts should be standard, the same as on an adult bike, and any bike shop should be able to make the switch. Coaster brakes are common in Europe on adult commuter bikes and in the US on "beach cruiser" type bikes. You're looking at a cog like this: 

Swapping chainrings would definitely help on climbs. Your current 30-32 bottom gear is reasonably low by touring standards, with a development of 30/32*Ï€*0.68 = 2.0m, where the 24T chainring will give you ... 1.6m (20% reduction). You'll really notice that. 26T will shift easier and still be significantly lower. Really the only reliable way to find out whether the rest of the components will work with it is to try. At worst you'll find that the front derailleur isn't really long enough to cope with the small chainring and the chain runs on the bottom of it for some of the smaller cogs on the cassette. Which is workable for many people - you end up with the granny ring only working with the biggest 3 or 4 cogs on the rear cassette. Shifting will likely be more difficult than you expect, especially getting out of that chainring back into the middle. Doing that shift while climbing will be tricky, and that's what kills it for many people. You only get one chance, and if you don't make the shift you have to drop back, recover the bike, speed up and try again. Which is annoying. To mitigate that it can help to change front derailleurs (basically buy the front triple derailleur with the widest range you can find), and drop a few teeth on the middle chainring to make the shift easier. That is at the cost, obviously, of harder shifts from the middle to big chainring since you've increased that gap. If you can afford it, I think it's well worth buying a 26T cog and seeing what happens. Other options You can get some benefit from a bigger cog on the cassette, but the jump from 32T to 36T is not particularly large and you will probably struggle to shift that with your current rear derailleur. The obvious fix is a Rohloff hub :) 

I can't find a useful answer because of that. I couldn't find statistics that answer "of the less than 1% of utility cyclists who wear helmets, how many were killed or injured"? Of course, having so many people riding bikes on the roads also means that of the people killed on the roads, a high proportion are cyclists (about one third). The Netherlands is also the safest place in Europe to use the roads (45 deaths/million pop, cf 145 in Greece which is the worst in Europe and 147 in the USA). What that means is that in The Netherlands about 185 cyclists die every year compared to 700-odd in the USA (~4x as many, thanks whatsisname). There are more than twenty times as many people in the USA... but more trips by bicycle in the Netherlands. You're still safer there than any inhabited part of the USA. You're safer on a bike in The Netherlands than in a car in the USA, even just looking at immediate crash danger rather than life expectancy (the lifetime risk of death remains 100%, obviously). There are some amusing results of that: 

You seem to be looking for a puncture resistant semi slick mountain bike tyre. That's a whole set of compromises, and they're not intercompatible. For a mountain bike tyre you want big knobbly sections and a thin tyre casing so it flexes easily when you run it at low pressure. But on the road you want high pressure, and for puncture resistance you need a thick casing. The problem with getting both big knobs and a slick tyre is obvious, but that's the most easily solved part - a semi slick tyre - and there are lots of them available. 

Caliper brakes attach differently to V brakes, they have one pivot bolt in the centre rather than one each side. In your first photo there's a bolt that is in the right place although it's there for a mudguard/fender not a brake: 

(this is more of a supplemental answer to Pete's one) The answer is somewhat different if you already have back pain vs if you don't. Simply, if you already have pain it's much easier to make it worse, but if you don't an upright bike is fairly unlikely to cause it. The main factor is likely to be how far forward you lean while stilling on the bike, with a racing bike putting you further forward. One reason cheap mountain bikes are so popular is that the more upright seating position is more comfortable. But the main area these bikes cause pain is your upper back and shoulders, from the extra weight resting on that area. But I'm not a medical professional, this is just opinion. You've left a few options off the list, though. Dutch Bikes are commonly even more upright and comfortable than mountain bikes. They're not fast, but they're comfortable and they're designed to be ridden in everyday clothing, and have luggage space.

One possible mechanism that occurs to me is that the larger tyre may hit fewer small pieces of glass because it rides higher over corrugations on the road. Using my well-renowned skills with paint.net I give you the following conceptual diagram: 

costThese will cost more to design, test, manufacture and assemble at point of sale than conventional handlebars. They're more complex, so I can't see any way around the extra cost. The benefit seems to be slim outside of some fairly specialised scanarios, and for many of those a conventional folding bike is probably a better choice - in a house where bikes are left in the hallway, for example, a folding bike might be able to be stored elsewhere, freeing up even more space in the hallway.Since most bikes are built to a price point, especially at the commodity end which the picture suggests is the target for this model, the extra cost of the folding bars has to come from other parts of the bike. weightFor equivalent materials and design, these will be heavier. On cheap bikes and BSO's this isn't an issue, but for a bike where an extra $20 for folding bars isn't an issue, weight usually is. Again, this just means the folding bars have to be useful enough to overcome the disadvantage, but it will serve to somewhat limit the market. failure modesObviously two pivots and a join mean there are more ways for this to fail. As well, since it's a new design we don't have 200-odd years if history to look back on. So it's going to require more testing and more experimentation to work out how it fails and how to minimise the extra failure modes. aesthetics/customer perceptionThis is possibly more "sales engineering", but they look odd. Most people like to fit in, and looking odd means less of that. Again, shrinking the market for the product. complexity of operationIt's a couple more steps every time you have to fold them. It likely takes as long to fold the bars as it does to fold a decent folding bike (I used to ride a Birdy and would often half-fold it just to park it). Even if they're not being folded or unfolded, that lockring in the centre should be checked every time the bike is ridden. legal liabilityAgain, not a factor everywhere, and not a factor at all if you're buying from a Chinese website. But the extra failure modes, extra operator checks required, and unusual design would make lawyers in a country like the US unhappy. Or excited, depending on which side of the case they're on. 

Put your lock through the wheel so the bike isn't rideable. It's harder to run carrying a bike than not, making it easier to catch the thief. Sure, they may break or bend a spoke if they try to jump on and pedal away, but if they do try that they'll come to an abrupt halt and be much easier to catch. The other advantage of that is that other cyclists can easily move your bike to remove theirs. You can also lock the bike before the bus arrives, speeding up the loading process. Adding your own tie-down to the bike may be enough, since whoever steals it has to discover and remove that as well, giving you more time to get out and grab them. I suggest using it as the lock above - wrap an ocky strap through a wheel and the frame, hooking one end where you can get to it easily, then when the bike is on the rack attach that end to the rack. That way it's fast and easy for you while the bus is waiting, but slow and annoying for someone trying to steal your bike. I use locking QR skewers on my bike, so I can lock my wheel to the rack and the wheel is already locked to the bike. But that takes time, and can mean I have to unlock and remove my bike in order for someone else to get their bike off, then I have to put my bike back on and re-lock it. I only do this at night or when it's a long trip, and after I've asked the driver. Usually they say yes, and often shuffle bikes so mine is on the bus side of the rack and won't need to be moved. I've had a driver wake me at my stop when we arrived because I was exhausted and had gone to sleep on the hour-ish bus ride. I made a note of that driver's name and rang the bus company to tell them how great the driver was, because Australia doesn't do tipping and positive feedback is rare enough that it's likely to count. You could use a cable lock looped through the rack, and that's one of the few places a cable lock might actually work - the bus driver isn't likely to stop while someone cuts the lock off... unless they stop specifically so someone can because you're not supposed to lock your bike to the rack. But without locking the wheels to the bike it's usually difficult to lock the bike to the rack with a D lock.
