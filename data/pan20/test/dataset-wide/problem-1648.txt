Again, we have no idea. A cat literally might be spacing out. We anthropomorphize and pattern-seek out a "contemplative look" on their faces and thus assume they must actually be contemplating. Until we rig up some better inter-species communication or analysis techniques for lower animals, we just won't know what a cat/dog is "thinking." Now, onto the potential truth. First of all, I think this area has been clouded with woo. Note the results for the google phrase, "using sound waves for healing". Lots of hinting at "deeper levels," spiritual refreshment, the bringing about of "oneness" and the like. See THIS for an example of what I'm talking about. I did find some references that indicate that audio frequencies may be beneficial for bone growth. 

Now THIS is a video of the durability test for the Chevy Volt. They record the local roads and then use the hydraulic simulator to recreate those conditions. The interviewee stated that the the "car life" is 100,000 miles and they run "three lives" worth of tests (300k total miles). He didn't mention train tracks, but did mention simulating "block" roads (in the video, the part where the car is driving over that uneven brick material). HERE are similar videos for VW and Audi tests, though I find the Audi one more believable. If the VW video is actually part of a [probably older] durability test, then I think it can stand up to train tracks. While these new simulators are pretty impressive, I wondered about taking into account weather aging factors. Audi mentions artificial aging (from the video looks like this includes salt, moisture, and heat/cold cycles). Not sure if the vehicle re-undergoes impact tests after the car has been artificially aged 10-12 years or not. THIS paper was quite fantastic in terms of a presentation of how, exactly, one simulates road conditions artificially. It also revealed some values used by the industry for roads. For example, it appears that road roughness values are conveyed in meters of accumulated suspension travel per kilometer of driving distance (m/km). The paper states: 

No, it doesn't. It maintains a better lumbar curvature, but that couldn't be correlated with back pain.

I was actually forwarded this study a few weeks ago and list it here to show that while the literature suggests that religion does have a positive effect on health and psychological states, so does mindfulness/meditation. Davidson also gives a talk entitled, "Be Happy Like a Monk" -- one can watch it or request the transcript HERE, if interested. 

They have quite a list of sources at the bottom of the page, but without footnotes, I don't particularly want to figure out which one might contain this information. I'm thinking it might be the "U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook" listed above, as this appears in the list of references. The webpage linked above for the sourcebook does have the following in it's list of figures provided (LINK) 

A recent CommonSenseAtheism post featured a picture in which St. Bernard of Corleone was named. Curious about the reference to "kill a few guys," I looked him upon on Wikipedia. Among the fact that he might have killed someone in a duel prior to entering a Capuchin monestary, something else caught my attention:

After you start eating, blood is redistributed to the gastro-intestinal tract to increase nutrients absorption. After a meal the blood pressure decreases a little and the heart rate increases. This is more common to the elders [1]. Food volume and caloric load are important determinants of gastric emptying and postprandial splanchnic hyperaemia, which appears to be a major contributor to hypotension [2]. It seems that postprandial changes in blood pressure are due to the nutrient composition of the meal rather than the actual energy load [3]. So, in a patient with ischemic cardiopathy or angina a square meal can trigger an infarction due to the increased oxygen needs of the miocardial muscle (increased heart rate) and hypotension. But this has nothing to do with bananas. Magnesium absorption is not dependent on the stomach. Most studies suggest that Mg is absorbed predominantly in the distal intestine. At usual Mg intakes, Mg absorption occurs primarily by intercellular diffusional and solvent drag mechanisms. There is evidence for a saturable component of Mg absorption in the small intestine and the descending colon that is important at low dietary Mg intakes [4]. A study made on rats suggest that bananas have protective properties on the gastric mucosa not only because of their phosphatidylcholine and pectin content [5]. But bananas contain dopamine at high levels in both the peel and pulp. Dopamine levels ranged from 80-560 mg per 100 g in peel and 2.5-10 mg in pulp, even in ripened bananas ready to eat. Banana is thus one of the antioxidative foods [6]. Dopamine induces acid secretion via activation of the dopamine D1 receptor, located on the cholinergic neurons and on some nonneuronal cells (study was made on rats) [7]. In this way, a banana on an empty stomach may trigger acute episodes of peptic ulcer over chronic lesions. References: 

The Mintel paper referenced is titled, "The U.S. Pet Food & Supplies Market," but I can't find a link to an abstract or something similar. 

The paper simulates person-to-person interactions in a social "network" by creating a system of nodes governed by something called binary agreement model, summarized by the paper this way: 

The same link discusses claims regarding better tasting coffee, the water's enhanced ability to draw out flavors in soups/stews which reduces the need for condiments and salt, and "giving freshness" to plants. There's a bunch more discussion about Kangen water at kangen.net. Just to add some meat to the discussion, here was an interesting, specific claim mentioned there (emphasis mine): 

So, we can see that late shifting results in a decrease in fuel economy. In automatic transmission cars, "flooring it" will result in the car being kept in as low of a gear as possible, thus bypassing the optimum shift point for maximum fuel economy. I wish the sources had been as simple as "faster acceleration yields lower fuel economy," but it wasn't quite that simple. For instance, I was quite surprised to find that more powerful cars did not suffer as badly from aggressive acceleration in the second source! The overall convergence of the sources is that faster acceleration (or at the very least, not shifting as speed increases) yields lower fuel economies.

Page 5 of the main report features a breakdown by world region. Check the report for all the region names and included countries, but the European region averages 12.18 liters/capita compared to the world average of 6.13. In pictures, that looks like this: 

I offer this simply to illustrate that (as Levin's paper about causality also aims at), it might not be merely religion that improves psychological conditions, but the aspects of social bonding, support, being accepted, having an important goal, a common purpose, etc. 

I'm curious if tests have been conducted to verify these claims. Perhaps the best and most practical/useful way to go about the question is: For the average house (# of windows, type, size, heating costs, etc.) in the northern US, is the cost of the window film (ideally more) regained in energy savings? 

The recorked bottle overflowed the condom, the open bottle inflated it, but the silver chain bottle would not inflate it, regardless of how much they shook the bottle. The Wine Lover's Page tested this HERE as well and found that both an open bottle and one with a silver spoon in the mouth maintained their carbonation overnight (makes one wonder about Straight Dope's test). You already found the Stanford writeup (which was quite narrative and inconclusive), and @warren linked to the Mythbusters "busted" rating. Then, just to complicate things, we have THIS writeup in which some folks took pictures of champagne that had been left open and been kept with a spoon and then digitally examined the poured glasses for bubble count and size... and they conclude that the spoon method did preserve more bubbles! That's about all I can find on the "myth." In terms of how to store it, it seems that the recommended method is an air-tight special stopper for carbonated wines, like are mentioned HERE and HERE. Don't know what "experts" to turn to regarding champagne storage, as there's not really scientific literature on this... but they at least do make such stoppers specifically for champagne, so I'm assuming people really do use them. 

Sunscreens absorb both UV-A (the radiation that can lead to cancer) and UV-B (the radiation that leads to sunburns) and transforms them into heat [2]. 

Although moderate alcohol consumption may protect against atherosclerosis, it promotes other cardiovascular diseases. Other factors should be taken into account too: 

However, more recent studies and reviews (although after surgery - when the etiological agent has been removed/suppressed, misalignments have been corrected) fail to confirm that on humans:

So, high stress and high caffeine have been shown to lead to a higher incidence of auditory hallucination after being directly primed for the "hallucination" -- hearing fragments of a song "embedded" in what was really white noise. As far as those concerned with such results, my suggestion would be to wait until replication that controls for other factors as well as another test method which does not prime. In other words, I assume that anyone wishing to translate this study into action would do so on the basis of safety or health concerns. I don't personally consider hearing song fragments after being primed to hear them in that category. Thus, if another study comes along and finds that subjects hear things on their own, without priming, and that such occurrences could be unsafe or unhealthy, then I'd act on such studies. 

Those would be the statistics to know, but I'm not paying $264 for the book! Nevertheless, the rest of the sources above seem to indicate that pet ownership is actually quite high among families with children, or at least higher for families with more than one child than with married/no-kid families.
