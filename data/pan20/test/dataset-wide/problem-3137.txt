The 1290 Expulsion of the Jews involved a fairly small number of people, about 2,000. only some of which were moneylenders. Their places were easily taken up by the Lombards, whose laws allowed moneylending. By the mid 14th century, there were complaints or at least suspicions that some of the "Lombards" were actually returned Jews. 

Nazi Germany had a program called Lebensborn that encouraged unwed (German) mothers to produce "Aryan" children. These would be from "begetters" who were high-ranking members of the Nazi party, or members of the SS. Because of the war, there was a shortage of "family" (read military) aged men at home, and a surplus of women of that age. The times when "unwed motherhood" was not stigmatized were usually when it was "state-sanctioned," as above. Another example put forth by another poster was with "sacred prostitutes." 

It appears to be the early 18th century. Peter the Great was the first Russian monarch to have a strong interest in naval affairs. According to Wikipedia, 

In 1492, the Ottoman Empire's Bayezid II sneered at Spain's Ferdinand of Aragon: "you call him a wise ruler, he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine," with the expulsion of Jews and Moors. Bayezid sent warships to Spain to pick them up and take them to his lands, forcing his governors to accept them on pain of death. They contributed heavily to the finance and commerce of his lands. Things had not changed much a century later, in 1609. The Ottoman Empire was "between" wars with the Hapsburgs. During the truces, their best "unofficial" weapon was the pirates of the Barbary Coast (modern Morocco and Algeria) that harassed commerce, particularly Spanish commerce, going through the Strait of Gibraltar. Many of these pirates were European Christians called "renegades" that converted to Islam for the privilege of living off the Spaniards. Expelled Moriscos (not all of them were) fit right in, if not as pirates themselves, traders and artisans that supported them. 

In 1860, the (Republican) "Party of Lincoln" was predominantly a "left" party, and even after a large infusion of conservatives such as McKinley and Taft around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, many Republicans were liberal. Senior party members became the "Establishment" because of the (mostly) Republican rule from 1860-1932, and even after the rise of the Democrats' FDR, liberal Republicans joined the liberal "New Dealers" to become the Establishment in the middle of the 20th century. Such Republicans could be either left or right of center, but were mostly "moderates." (The post Civil War Democrats included an unlikely mix of extreme right and left (e.g. George Wallace and George McGovern), basically people who weren't Republicans.) The "Establishment Republicans" of Reagan's time were otherwise known as the "Rockefeller Republicans," named after New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, a direct descendant of John D. These were often liberal, sometimes moderate Republicans that were "anti-Conservative." That is, they were Republican in the socio-economic sense of being well off, (and usually well born), as opposed being ideologically conservative, like most of today's Republicans. As such, Reagan, a conservative former Democrat, was no favorite of the "Establishment" Republicans. The "Reagan Revolution" largely re-aligned the Republican and Democratic parties as conservative and liberal, with liberal "Establishment" Republicans leaving the party and joining the Democrats (e.g. Mrs. Theresa Heinz-Kerry), and conservative Democrats realigning with the Republican Party. That is to say, the pre 1960s Republicans and Democrats were defined mainly by social class (high or low) while the post 1980 Republicans were defined mainly by ideology (conservative or liberal). Reagan was a catalyst of this ideological realignment, and therefore disliked by liberal "Establishment" Republicans. 

Lincoln changed his views on a number of issues over time. For instance, he started out "pro business," and later became the "prairie populist" defending people against business interests. But the greatest change in Lincoln's philosophy came on the issue of slavery. Up to about 1850, he believed that "I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery." That's because the Louisiana Purchase had given the free states more room for expansion than the slave states. As shown in this map, the free states could expand into the area in the dark green, while the slave states were restricted to the southern light blue area (Arkansas, Oklahoma) plus Louisiana and Missouri. These parameters were drawn by the Missouri Compromise of 1820. But the acquisition of Texas and California, and the land in between changed that. First, the South beat back the so-called Wilmot Proviso, that would have outlawed slavery in the new territories. Then Douglas proposed the Kansas Nebraska Act that rolled "back" (northward), the Missouri Compromise line of 36' 30, meaning that a whole tier of states including Kansas, Colorado, Utah and Nevada were eligible for slavery; even California, which had elected to enter the Union as a free state. Now it seemed that slavery could not be "contained." So during the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Lincoln gave the so-called "House Divided" Speech, which read in part: "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." By that time, he had become an "abolitionist," who wanted slavery ended altogether. 

That appears to be the case. Maybe they didn't "have to" do this, but lapel buttons were issued to e.g Chinese-Americans. At the very least, it was highly advisable for other Asian-Americans to distance themselves from the Japanese-Americans. Probably a few Japanese-Americans passed themselves off as non-Japanese, just as a few Jews did so in Nazi-controlled Europe. 

This is a compendium of what I've learned from the other answer and the comments. There were several natural advantages of the Pilsen location, pointed out in detail by Vector; abundant raw materials and suitable labor nearby, and the presence of enterpreneur Emil Skoda, a "native son." Mark C. Wallace asked an important question in a comment (since deleted) about how far the Skoda Works matched Austria-Hungary's needs. The answer was, "pretty closely," which meant that there wasn't a need for a second plant. One important consideration was that this project was undertaken at the initiative of Mr. Skoda, who put forth, and got his terms. It's not like the Austro-Hungarian government put out an RFP ((Request for proposal) and said, "let's take the top two," as the American government might, given its concerns about anti-trust issues. On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarian government didn't "push back" on Mr. Skoda to diversify by building a second plant elsewhere. 

In the 19th century U.S., there were basically two types of "gentlemen." The first was the landed gentry. Obvious enough, the idea came from England and Europe generally. This may have represented 1% of the population. The second type was "professional" men; doctor, lawyer, scientist, all with university degrees. These were expensive in terms of money and "time spent" that could have been used to earn money. Perhaps 2% of the population had such a degree., like Judge Thatcher in Tom Sawyer. Basically, we're talking about 3% of the population; 5% tops. Apart from the fact that e.g. a successful gold miner in California or oil driller in Texas might be considered a gentleman "locally" (but not elsewhere until the second generation, because it was "new" money), the definition didn't vary much from region to region, but the mix did. For instance, there were more professional men in New England, and a larger proportion of landowners in the South. So one would become a gentlemen by acquiring either a university degree and a profession, or land. "Once a gentleman, always a gentlemen," (that is professional or landowner) so this status was hard to lose, except by the next generation, or by a nouveaux riche (it was possible to lose all your gold, but not all your land).
