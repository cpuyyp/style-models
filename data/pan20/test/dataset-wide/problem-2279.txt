It might be surprising that this question is not as "simple" as it seems. As already stated a field tip is of course there to do target shooting. The crux is that not every "target arrowhead" is automatically a field tip. However, this kind of tip is defined through it's form. It has a pretty pointy conical shape: It's often preferred to practice for the hunt. The reasons for this are pretty subjective in my opinion (and I doubt them) and that's why I don't cover them here. Overview 

Source: Anglerhut von www.anglerhut.com Google Translate: Most of these hats are a good protection against rain, because they are virtually waterproof. There are also fishing hats that protect a very high sun protection factor and against sunburn and sunstroke. For very cold regions or winter anglers can also get very warm Angler hats, which are made for example of fleece. The materials for fishermen hats are generally breathable. 

From Wikipedia - Ice Circle Your Ice Circle This particular ice disk (from your video), was formed because there was a certain climate which is perfect for such phenomenon to build. 

It is more about style than routes. The term "Sport climbing" generally (traditionally) refers to climbing (routes longer than boulder problems) in such a way that the climber only have to focus on overcoming technical difficulty, not risk management. This differs from trad[itional] climbing where the climber always must consider if the protection available is sufficient (depending on the climbers skill and risk acceptance) "Sport climbing" is thus more about a style of climbing than a classification of routes. There are bolted routes that definitely are not "Sport" and naturally protected routes that can be climbed in a "sport" manner with todays equipment. However, many use "Sport climbing" as equivalent to "Climbing on fully bolted routes". The "Sport climbing" that is now an olympic sport would rather be called "Competition climbing" by those who care about the difference. "Competition climbing" is sport climbing (or bouldering) arranged in such a way that you have a fair competition. (similar conditions for participants etc) 

I've been to Sarek twice and hiked other parts of the swedish and norwegian mountain range (some "wilder" than sarek) more than a dozen times. Here is my view: Sarek is wild, beautiful, but far from deserted during the peak hiking season. If you choose one of the more common paths, you will certainly meet other hikers. There are marked paths with huts that see less traffic than the main valleys of Sarek. That being said, in the middle of Sarek, You are on you own. Outside help is not to be counted on if something goes wrong. Cell phone coverage is almost zero. A sat phone works of course, but see it as a back up, not something you rely on. So to your question, what can go wrong? First we have the general hazards of hiking in the mountains. You might get sick. You might hurt yourself, sprain an ankle or break a leg. You might run into bad weather (Freezing temeratures possible even in summer) Those things might just as well happen on Kungsleden (or at home), but the consequences in Sarek are more serious since you're off-trail two days hike from help. So take that boy scout motto to heart: be prepared. Make sure to have some extra rations and days so you can stay put if the weather turns foul, or if you need to rest. Then there two specific dangers that makes Sarek more serious than Kungsleden: 1) Navigation. Though Sarek is quite easy to navigate in good visibility (simply follow the valleys) it is another matter if it gets foggy. And though the certainly are paths to follow, they are not marked. Be confident with map and compass. 2) Fording. On a marked trail like Kungsleden, there are bridges over the streams. With a bit of luck with the weather you'll even keep your feet dry. In Sarek, there are only a few bridges. You won't be able to cross it or get into the central parts without fording minor and major streams. Don't take this lightly. Loosing footing in a rapid stream is really bad news. Read up on the route you're plannning so you don't end up on the wrong side of a stream you cannot cross... Apart from those two, more alpine hazards face you if you fancy climbing the summits, but peaks and glaciers are an option on a sarek trip, not a necessity. Naturally You also need to be fit and motivated enough for a ten day unsupported hike. 

From icwdm So, it's more important that you even make sound in the first place than what sound it is. But as you've the choice with your speaker setup, you should either use Wolf, Mountain Lion, Bear or Cougar sounds as they are the most dangerous predators (in this order) for coyotes.

I'm wondering if one has to be careful while hiking through historical significant areas. Let's say there is a Celtic grave which is pretty good excavated. Am I allowed to walk over it? I'm asking for the UK (other regions would be interesting, too of course). 

I swam in Mediterranean in Italy quite often. There often were white (not spectacular looking) jellyfish around - and quite a lot of them. I tried not to touch them because I was afraid to get burned (even though I don't think that this species stings) and that I'll harm these animals. However, I am a little surprised that I've managed to never get in contact with one. You can't see them quite good and there a really a lot of them sometimes. Do they actively try to avoid contact? 

Create a common challenge, a group purpose Backpacking (for me) is a lot about the adventure, excitement and challenges that naturally come along if you try to navigate through unknown situations - whether that would be hiking through nature or experiencing other cultures. If you agree on a common group goal, something that is at least difficult to achieve, the group feeling will emerge very naturally. Some personal examples I have gone through over the years: When a friend and I found ourselves with little money in an overly expensive city abroad, we tried to get a job. It was not easy because, at the time, we were not fluent in the local language at all and needing to find a job was somewhat of a burden for us but in the end we managed and this experience tied us together for the rest of the trip. Another time, two friends of mine and I were mountaineering and got caught in rain. While passively hiking in a line, each of use developed his or her own fears of hypothermia (it was cold, we were wet). Being experienced trail-runners we decided to speed things a bit up and run rather than walk. While such a decision is not always recommendable, everything turned out well for us: the running kept us warm and it also sparked some sense of group identity. All our bad feelings (misery from the rain first, anxiety, being passive) got washed away and were replaced with positive ones (a common plan to evade the situation, the happiness hormones, the team spirit running at the same pace creates) and because it was us three against the weather, all good feeling were somehow projected onto the group. That was also very beneficial for the rest of the trip. 

Based on survival series, films etc. most of the people stranded on a lonely island (not necessarily restricted to this situation of course) over a long period start with agriculture at some point. While I understand that it gives you great benefits, it also consumes resources (water, energy etc.). When do I know that the benefits outweigh the "waste" of resource (my daily routine is that stable, that it can handle the additional expense), so that I should start with agriculture? Which precedence does it have (like "Don't start with agriculture before you haven't ...")? 

From Brainfacts backed up with this study Animals in the wilderness aren't in the luxurious position to choose between a served zebra, hippo or antelope (and humans shouldn't be either if you ask me). They get hungry, they hunt, they eat - simple as that. They choose whatever is the most efficient way to reduce their hunger. Imagine the lion would hunt the an antelope down, kills it and invest a huge amount of energy overall. He wouldn't do that twice just because he thinks that the zebra over there is a bit more tasty. Don't get me wrong. This works the other way around, too. Animals are picky if they can. A common house cat may for example prefer tuna wet above dry food. This pickiness seems to be gone after a few days with the dry food only. Also don't think that wild animals aren't picky at all. This is only true for pure taste-pickiness. Several animals don't eat specific plants or other species because it's bad for them. 

Climbing shoes don't wear out from age alone (in any realistic time frame that is). However, the rubber in the soles do age (probably because it "dries" and oxidizes over time) which affects the shoes performance negatively. You can fresh up old but not worn out soles with sand paper or a steel brush to get some of the original stickiness back. And of course you can always resole. Good fit and sticky rubber is what makes a good allround climbing shoe. 

The theory is that (sport) grades should reflect the technical skill, strength and stamina required to redpoint the route. Therefore the definition of, say a 8a route is that "a climber that consistently climbs 8a routes will succeed while a 7a+ climber will struggle" When climbers talk about grades on sections of routes, they actually mean "if this section was an isolated route, it would be graded 8c". Naturally, climbing a hard crux after a sustained section of hard moves is not the same as if the same crux comes after a good rest position. One must remember that grading is complex and subjective, and that an individual climbers will "achieve" higher grades on routes that suits their style and strenghts and "underperform" on routes that targets their weaknesses. 

I'm absolutely harsh when it comes to littering in the woods. After a break I take an extra turn to check if everything was picked up. Someone accidentally left a tissue on the last tour and I put it in my pocket. As we randomly chatted about this "incident", he told me not to care so much about handkerchiefs cause they are perfectly biodegradable. Is this true? Extra kudos: What about cotton handkerchiefs? 

You don't need a specific trailer. Just make sure that it's a 2,7 tons trailer with a keel tub. An example would be the "Wick braked tandem trailer 2700 kg": 

There are a few benefits why this has evolved as a good choice for fishermen. These benefits apply to other outdoor activities also! That's why the hat is popular among all kinds of outdoorsmen. However, I'll explain the advantages based on fishing but it's mostly common sense to figure out similar circumstances for other activities. First of all, fishing often means to be a lot in the bright sun (on a boat, near the river with no trees etc.). That's why a good fisherman hat provides UV protection of 40+. 

I used to think this question was a bit ridiculous. The volume of air that we take in while breathing may be high but the lungs only consume 25% of the oxygen for any breath and the rest is returned. Closing the windows while sleeping in a room or sleeping in a closed tent does not affect one's breathing. (At least, it never did for me and I have never heard of such a case.) However, when I tried my new bivouac sack (measures 2.1 m long, 66 cm wide, 50 cm high) last weekend there was a point during the night where I experienced some unrest. I could not sleep (which is not that unusual when it is cold) but also my breathing became very heavy and shallow. More surprisingly, when I opened the bivouac sack's door, the breathing relaxed immediately. I did some background research on this and from this calculation, it seems that humans consume one cubic meter of air in half a day. So if we break this down to a quarter cubic meter for 6 hours of sleep, it might come close to the volume of air that was available in the sack. (But then again I still can't believe it.) In the end, I left the door a bit opened for the whole night. However, I do not think this is solution will always work. Now I wonder, was what I experienced mainly psychological or are oxygen shortages while sleeping in a bivouac a real thing? Additional background that may or may not inform answers to the question: The temperature was about 0 °C (32 °F), the air was humid (rather foggy, close to a river) and the elevation was at 500 meters above sea level. I went to stay in the bivouac at 7 pm, the breath shortages occurred, I think, around midnight. 

Ice Disk That phenomenon is called an ice disc or ice circle. It occurs in slow moving water in cold climates. 

Do we have to be additional carefully in areas where a Geyser is quite common? Can their water reach dangerous temperatures? Is it possible that one just "randomly" pops out of the ground? Are there any other threads to consider? 

I've had a fracture in my left leg about twelve years ago. However, if I do a lot of stuff, like let's say Mo: 3D-archery, Tu: jogging, Wed: hiking, Th: jogging, this old fracture hurts a lot. Especially when my body starts to come down again. While I run (etc.) I don't feel anything but when my body starts to relax. Is there a way to get rid of this?
