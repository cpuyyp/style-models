I have come-up with a hand-run sketch, may or may not be accurate. But I have tried to translate the local terms we use, and I have pick-up the terms in English that came closest in terms of meaning. 

A shoe like the one shown above, usually come with a longer shoelace. I usually, leave alone the upper two Eyelets and instead encircle the laces around the shoe, passing them through the sling you are referring to and tie a knot in front. This ensures that my leg/shin don't rub strongly against the hard topline of the shoe, specially when I am descending. By passing the through the sling makes sure that the laces don't shift up and get loosen up. But I agree, the most useful feature of those slings is for pulling the shoes and tieing them up when needed. 

Assuming that you have the right kind of a backpack according to your requirements. First, you need to separate things that you need frequently and things you'll need less often. The way I camp/trek and plan things, I am okay to pack everything all over again in the morning. Generally, it is best suited to pack lighter items in the bottom of the pack and heavier stuff toward the top, the idea is to keep heavier stuff closer to your back and not on bum. This keeps your center of gravity relatively high. Center of gravity plays a very important role in balancing your body when in motion. Higher Center of gravity tends to make it easy to haul the backpack easily while your performance with balance is hampered. Women naturally have a lower center of gravity, so the women I know and trek with, they pack heavier stuff at the bottom, that further increases their stability. Remember, The lower your center of gravity is , the easier it is to keep yourself balanced, pack feels heavier. The higher your center of gravity is, the easier it is to haul the pack but chances are more to dwell/tip off or go off-balance. 

As you proceed to polish it, all the ink should go off. Once the ink is gone, you can take a look at the knife with the blade edge in line with light and tilt the knife around a bit, slowly. If you see any glint on the edge, that part needs some work with the finer side of the stone. Once done, clean off the stone! 

(May be not entirely needed for this answer, but interesting: Why would lungs exert, its because you don't warm your lungs enough, Mucus around the Lung Fibers and tissues isn't enough, the bronchial muscles get dry, resulting in constriction.) 

The title may itself sound a little weird, indeed it does. But this I have observed over the time, when I take a look at my shoes. I think I have a strange walking style, in which I probably land a bit banked on the right part of the feet of my left leg. That is why I can see my left shoe more worn out on the right part of it than the left. Eventually such a shoe become a little uncomfortable to use because it doesn't have a uniform bottom. And, this again make me land my left foot on right part of it. This is somehow making my left leg to over-exert. And, I may end up twisting my ankle someday. Its not specific for a pair of shoe either. I was thinking if I can add some sort of an additional padding/cushion in the socks. But I think I want to root out the cause for it, rather than getting used to with some such cushion. Can anyone suggest some exercise? 

I have never used a Mummy type sleeping bag, rather I have hardly used a sleeping bag. I am afraid, I am more of a carry-mat, sleeping-pad and a blanket guy. It never occurred to my mind that What must be the advantage of a Mummy type sleeping bag over a Blanket type? over even vice-versa if it is so? 

I loved and appreciate the concept of Mountain Huts. Though I have never visited one, this really sounds appealing. In my country, India, we don't have Mountain Huts, so we have to manage it all on our own. But, I wonder if a local organization clears out the necessary obligations and does finish formalities for that, what should a Mountain Hut be equipped with? P.S. I am not referring to higher altitudes. I am typically speaking about Indian subcontinental weather, where it rains heavy during June to September and rest of the season is pretty much hot, ambient temperature is at about 38 oC. 

You can use something like a Bike Handle cover, the one that has a cap on the other end. You can get it of the size that your axe-blade fits in. I assume that the main blade will be a bit hard to fit in, but then you can always give a try towards getting the handle cover which is a bit flexible(probably made of vulcanized rubber?) You could get a leather packet sewed/tailored to fit the blade in. Provide some kind of a sling-thread thing to wrap around it? 

As Ben said above that your hip belt may need be used the way it should be. I struggled with heavy packs, so I started following a way to adjust my pack this way: Loosen all the straps, Adjust the hip belt, over the hip bones. If the belt sits too high, it might constrict the stomach. If the position is too low, the fins might chafe. Now tighten the shoulder straps, but not too tight. The main weight should be on the hip belt. Once you have found the perfect back length, fix and close the height adjustable sternum strap. Not too tight, since it could hinder breathing. The strap stabilizes the shoulder straps and is a standard feature of almost all packs. If you wear a shirt/T-shirt that doesn't fit neat, it may cause chafing after a long walk with a heavy backpack. Wear synthetic fabrics. Clothing that wicks moisture away from the skin significantly reduces chafing. When you are without a shirt, then probably some anti-friction lotions might help, but with a heavy pack I'd never go without a shirt. Try out different kinds of anti-friction products. You can often buy trial packs of different kinds to help you find one you like. When you do find one that works, buy several so youâ€™re never stuck without it. (Please reconsider if you have a skin pattern which is too hypersensitive to lotions) 

How to tie up a tent to a sack in order to carry it over a long distance? I recently bought this sack, and I carried it over this weekend with my 4-men tent, and it was damn bad a day to have it along. Its a large tent, so it doesn't fit into my pack, I have to pack it separate. And the bag/pack they have provided with tent doesn't really have anything that makes it easy to carry. The only way I see is to attach it to my backpack. The pack would definitely lean on the side the tent was attached. And I had to tighten up the same shoulder strap so the it doesn't swing my back around, that killed my shoulder. How would you tie-up such a tent and managing the load distribution with that?
