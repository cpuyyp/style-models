Do we have any record of the reaction of the average British person to the Boston Tea Party? Would the proverbial man on the street have been aware of the event? If so, what was their perception of it immediately following news of the event reaching Britain? I have found a lot of material about the state's reaction to the event, but not much about the average person. T.E.D. says in a comment: 

The quote is by Harold Geneen from his 1984 book Managing. I first found evidence of this from Wikiquote: 

The catch-all term is "the Alpine Celts". This is divided into two major groups: the Cisalpine Celts and the Transalpine Celts (which also includes the Celts in what are today France and Belgium). The Cisalpine Celts are those that are on the Italian side of the Alps, including the Lepontic and the Cisalpine Gauls. The Transalpine Celts are those on the other side of the Alps from Italy. The Transalpine Celts are predominantly Gauls (Transalpine Gauls). The major tribe in the Swiss plateau at the time of contact with the Roman Republic was the Helvetii tribe. 

Note: I have discovered papers such as this, but I am unable to ascertain whether the paper is reputable (I'm unfamiliar with the scholars in this field) or whether it contains much in the way of an answer to my question. It would be nice to know that before purchasing access to a paper at random. In this case, the paper seems to be freely accessible and at a glance appears scholarly, yet I still cannot verify if it represents the current state of research. 

To verify, I did a Google Books search. It does appear to be original text and not a quote within that work. 

emphasis added It wasn't until the advent of the Air Force that hearing protection really became significant: 

According to Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many* by Erik Hornung, this is a foreign idea that has been projected upon the ancient Egyptians, due to their frequent blending of gods: 

The Irish (Gaelic) culture and Vedic culture are generally understood to have a common origin in the Proto-Indo-European culture. Gaelic and Sanskrit are both Indo-European languages. Some linguists have reconstructed Proto-Indo-European deities, from which some of the Irish and Hindu deities are believed to be derived, with varying levels of confidence. Among these are *Dehnu- (proposed origin of Vedic goddess Dānu and Irish goddess Danu) and *Neptonos or *Hepom Nepōts (proposed origin of Vedic god Apám Nápát and Irish god Nechtain). There are also similarities between the practices and beliefs of the Gaelic druids and the Hindu Brahmins, that may share a common origin as well. However, these are not understood to have come from India. The Proto-Indo-Europeans are generally understood to have come from an eastern European or central Asian location, their descendants having migrated to both the British Isles and the Indian subcontinent, among other locations. 

After some searching, I cannot find an older succinct expression of the concept than that in the book Ecclesiastes from the Hebrew Tanakh, which has become the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. Ecclesiastes (Koheleth in Hebrew) is a piece of wisdom literature on the topic of futility, which dates to somewhere between 450-180 BCE. In Ecclesiastes 1:9 it is expressed:

According to the Wikipedia article on the Abacus, Ettore Carruccio stated in Mathematics and Logic In History and In Contemporary Thought that the Old Babylonians: 

From A Dictionary of the Roman Empire by Matthew Bunson, in the section on Augustus, we learn that he suffered from health problems his whole life. While it does not mention specifically what he suffered from in 23 B.C., it is possible that it was a strain of influenza, which he might have been more susceptible too, being so sickly. He had previously suffered from influenza before. 

So, for the United States at least, it wasn't until 1948 that preventative measures against the hearing loss of soldiers were really taken seriously. Source: 

Prior to the successful launch of Sputnik 1, there were some who believed that space travel was impossible. I would like to know how widespread this notion was, particularly "in scientific and engineering circles" (as Goddard said) but also throughout academia and in the public (if record exists). I'm primarily interested in three time periods: 1945 (when Goddard said the subject was still to be avoided) to 1957 (the launch of Sputnik 1), 1923 (when Oberth first proposed space travel with rockets) to 1945, and 1865 (the publication of From the Earth to the Moon) to 1923. Before 1865, I'm pretty sure most people perceived space travel to be a fanciful notion, at best. 

To answer this question, you first have to answer another complex question: Who are the English? This question turns out to be quite complex indeed because to this day scholars are unsure whether to subscribe to an invasionist/migrationist view or a diffusionist view in regards to the Britons, the Celtic people of Great Britain (excluding Scotland) which are one of the early peoples which preceded the English. To give a rough explanation, the former would mean that the Briton culture came to Great Britain from the continent with its people, whereas the latter would mean that contact with the continent transformed the existing people on the island into the Briton culture. So, who were these people that were already in Great Britain? Modern humans first reached Britain around 42,000 years ago, but during the last glacial maximum between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago, the island is generally believed to have been unoccupied again. People may have begun occupying the island immediately after the last glacial maximum, but by 9600 BC there was certainly an established population. To give these people some context, some Mesolithic postholes were dug in the Stonehenge area around 8000 BC, so ritual activity had certainly begun. Over the years prior to the Britons, the cultural changes are generally believed to have happened within a more or less consistent population. For example, 4000 BC brought the Neolithic culture, and the Bronze Age culture arrived about 2300 BC. By 800 BC, the Briton Iron Age had begun in Britain, and this population expanded to about three or four million by the first century BC, mostly concentrated in the south. Update 4/23/2018: It looks like the Neolithic culture that built Stonehenge may have been replaced by a Bronze Age invasion, after all. See Ancient-genome study finds Bronze Age ‘Beaker culture’ invaded Britain - Ewen Callaway in Nature. One possible argument for the diffusionist theory is that the Briton druids are understood to have made use of Stonehenge, which was built prior to the Britons. It is certainly possible that invaders made use of the existing religious monument, but it is perhaps somewhat more likely that there existed at least a strain of continuity between the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age peoples of the island. Some of the Iron Age Britons may have been the first to call themselves British, or Pretanoi. The Greek Pytheas "discovered" Britain in c. 325 BC. This event marked the beginning of the expansion of the Greco-Roman world northward in Europe. Between 200 BC and AD 43, the Germanic-Celtic refugees from Gaul began migrating to Britain, as the Romans expanded into Gaul. The southern tribes started to become more Romanized, and it is this influence of Germanic and Roman culture which began the transition of the Britons into the English. By AD 40, the Roman Empire had conquered southern Britain, and the period known as Roman Britain began. It is the Romano-British culture which gave rise to the early legends which would later be transformed into the Arthur myth. After the Romans withdrew from Britain in about AD 410, the Germanic Anglo-Saxons began their series of invasions of the island. As Wikipedia puts it: 

I arrived at this type of conjecture myself, but I'm interested in evidence, if there is any. In response to further comments questioning the newsworthiness of the Boston Tea Party at the time, here is a piece from the "London Magazine" in 1774: 

(NIV) This concept is repeated throughout the book to reinforce the theme of the futility of human effort. The philosophy is not original. As has been pointed out in the comments, it bears resemblance to the notion of eternal return: the idea that in an infinite universe there must be a cycle of time in which the same events repeat over and over. This idea has been discussed in ancient cultures around the world. The book of Ecclesiastes does not go as far as declaring a concept of eternal return, which would have gone directly against the traditional Jewish belief in a linear timeline with a defined beginning and end. Perhaps the idea is expressed so succinctly because it was a somewhat novel idea in Jewish culture. The phrase has taken on a life of its own, and is often quoted. It is so common that it has been used as the title of numerous papers across various disciplines. Further reference: 

Abel Stearns emigrated to Mexico in 1826 and naturalized in 1828. In 1829 he moved out to Monterey, California, and he eventually settled in Pueblo de los Ángeles, which would become the Los Angeles that we know today. The RootsWeb biography says: 

The position of "Limited" in relation to "Smallman &" does resemble the "Smallman and Ingram" logo, for example on their catalog. While John Smallman and Lemuel Ingram started their retail store with a specialty in clothing, they quickly expanded to carry other dry goods, as both had experience working in the market. The business was based out of London, Ontario. The original location was at 147 Dundas Street in 1877. Smallman created Smallman & Ingram Limited in 1908, after the death of Ingram in 1901. He did bring Ingram's family into the business. In 1944, Simpson's of Toronto bought them out, but Gordon Ingram (son of Lemuel) remained as chairman. The store is now known as Market Tower. The most I can tell you about the Keuroglouians is that the Armenian Catholic Church of Toronto was established in 1972. At the least we can say that they donated this book well after Smallman & Ingram Limited was bought out. Sources: 

However, recent genetic studies show that there was not really a mass displacement at all. Rather, the relatively small groups of Anglo-Saxon invaders had a large cultural impact on the existing British population. The most notable theory to explain why the Anglo-Saxon culture had such a profound effect on the indigenous people is that the political and economic dominance of the Anglo-Saxons made their culture more desirable. Of course, what exactly gave the Anglo-Saxons an advantage is more complex, and I'll leave that up to the reader to pursue further (more information is available in the linked Wikipedia articles). By 1066, when William the Conqueror took the English throne, the English culture was already well established, and William's advancements--such as new castles and a census--served only to strengthen the fledgling nation. The answer to your question, then, is that the English are likely dominant because they are probably composed of the steadily growing population sprung from the more or less original inhabitants of the island. Wales and Scotland, then, are the exceptions, and they deserve further scrutiny. Some of the Welsh tribes made peace with the Romans, and thus were able to maintain some of their identity through the Roman period. The Anglo-Saxons were not able to penetrate all the way into Wales, possibly because the Romans had not built as much infrastructure there. The Romans were never able to invade much of Scotland, possibly because it was hard to fight the tribes in the Highlands. Eventually the Romans gave up their land in southern Scotland, and the territory was dominated by native tribes, such as the Picts in the north. After the Romans withdrew from Britain, the Gaels from Ireland invaded Scotland in the west, and the Picts withdrew to the east. Eventually, gaelicization (the influence of the Gaels), transformed Scotland, and the Gaelic and Pictish crowns merged. The strength of this new kingdom is what kept Scotland independent from the English in the south, and that is another topic that deserves further study by the reader. Wikipedia References:
