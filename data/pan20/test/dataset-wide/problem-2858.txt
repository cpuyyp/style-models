But in the other room the other being sees the and thinks the teleportation has worked. He leaves the room and is happy to be one of the first humans to experience teleportation and continues to live the life he knows. You are still in the first room and wondering if the teleportation has already happened. Your future life is in room A and you will experience whatever the living being in room A experiences and not the other one. So if they kill you you will die. You wont have any future experiences / wake up. Scenario Teleportation ('instant kill') You are a pile of atoms that is somewhere in space and time. If someone pushes you you are still a pile of atoms in space and time. Nothing special connects the two instances of you. Only that you identify as the same person because of memories (your brain or whatever). You go to room and close your eyes, then get measured and killed in the process (or afterwards like in the first scenario) and build in room . Both instances of you (the previous one in room and the current in room ) are the same pile of atoms. The being in room B identifies as 'you' because thats what it is. Its not different then someone pushing you. You are just in an other place but still identify as you. Question Im confused. I described the same process in 2 different ways. Will wake up after teleportation? What are some other opinions on this matter? 

Your presentation of Pascal's wager takes there to be two states the world could be in relevant to the utility of taking the wager: "God exists" or "God doesn't exist." But we should probably break each of these into many sub-states. "God exists" becomes "The Christian god exists"; "The Jewish god exists"; ... and many other possibilities, each of which has its own sub-possibilities. That won't sink your argument, even if some of these don't take God to reward followers. But the "God doesn't exist" state should be broken into states like "an evil demon exists who will punish people for believing in God." And depending on the credences we assign to these states attaining, Pascal's wager might have negative utility. 

It's not clear that it's to cause yourself to believe in God as a result of Pascal's wager. Many people think you can only believe what you take the evidence to support, and you don't (by hypothesis) take the evidence to support the existence of God. So Pascal's wager might just be an argument that you should take steps to change your cognitive dispositions, exposure yourself to biased evidence, etc. to increase your willingness to believe in God's existence. (But these steps might have significant disutility). 

One big problem with the mathematical equal is that the frame is pure logical. An LGBT person can marry as many people as a normal (I want to use this word) person but they don't value it the same way. No one has the right to marry someone from their own sex no matter what how you feel. I quite honestly get angry when they come out with their propaganda of equal rights like we are talking about women suffrage. The demanded thing is to extend the law so that they feel comfortable with it. The problem is that the law would need to be adjusted for the benefits of LGBT(2.5% - 5%) against the non secular believes of a part of the population and the traditions we hold as a society.. source lgbt population 

If god is omniscience he would know how we(he / universe) became and why. What purpose there is in live. What his 'duty' is. If he has to pray or not. All that he would know. But the thing about the idea that a god exists is that you dont want to know. If you ask yourself if god knows everything you are allready questioning religion and you cant be a true Christian (what you already stated). No one who seriously believes in god would even consider that god doesn't know everything and therefore has to believe in a god. If god would have to believe in other gods is he really a god? Since he cant be omniscience or omnipotent what basically would degrade him from being a god. At the end of the day, if there is a god and he would belive in other gods. But the only knowledge we have about him is: He is the only god there is plus omniscience and omnipotent. Then we have to come to the conclusion that he does not believe in other gods because of the 'knowledge' we have. Even when in our hypothetical he was believing in other god. 

Perhaps you mean: "Can there be undemonstratively true truths?" Aristotle, when resolving the infinite regress problem, shows, against those who believed no or all truths are demonstrable, that there are some truths which cannot be demonstrated to be true. Thus, Aristotle could be considered a precursor to Gödel. See 

(source) Note: Some of his commentaries are only partial (e.g., he didn't commentate on Books 13—Μ & 14—Ν of Aristotle's Metaphysics). Also, "Let No One Ignorant of Geometry Enter" was allegedly written above the door of Plato's Academy. Whether this is true or a legend, it does show the importance of logic and mathematics for Plato (and certainly for his student, too).

Many organized religions don't take God to reward those who believe in God for pragmatic reasons only. So it's not clear that belief in God should be assigned high utility. 

Let's rephrase the doctrine a bit, because Geometry is a tricky case due to the study of consistent non-Euclidean geometries. For example, in spherical geometry you can construct a triangle with two right angles. Since the doctrine in question was espoused before the advent of non-Euclidean geometry, let's give them the benefit of the doubt and rephrase it. Suppose the idea is that even God can't change logical facts. Then you might say that even God could not make a claim simultaneously true and false (unless you go in for paraconsistent logics). Suppose the idea is that even God can't change mathematical facts. Then you might say that even God could not make induction false over the natural numbers, or true over the reals. Or maybe that even God couldn't make it the case that 2+2=5. (This is hairier, since as in the case of geometry this can be false in some arithmetic-like models, i.e. the integers mod 2, but here we take ourselves to have good reason to say that those aren't the natural numbers.) The justification for these claims is that it's unclear what it could even be for God to change such facts. What would it be for God to make it both true and false that I have two hands? Or to make it false that (p and q) entails p? Or that a mathematical property could be had by 0, and passed up from each number to the next, but not be true of all natural numbers? (we have a good understanding of how this property can fail, but not how it can fail over the natural numbers). Edit: Realized I didn't directly address the questions at the bottom. Most (not all) philosophical views about mathematics don't take geometry to be describing physical objects or tie the truth of propositions about triangles and the like to the existence of suitably related structures in the world. They could think there are real shapes corresponding to geometrical objects (one example of this view would be Platonism), but think this in the same sense that there's a real object corresponding to, say, any given function, algebra, splitting field, or the like. So they definitely don't think the subject matter of geometry is visible things (any more than the subject of arithmetic is collections of pebbles). Depending on your ontological views you might think there are objects (i.e. collections of spacetime points) corresponding to particular geometrical objects, but the truth of mathematical propositions is not taken to depend on their existence. A notable exception is nominalism, which holds that for propositions about triangles, well-ordered sets and the like to be true there must be concrete physical objects (broadly understood) in the world corresponding to them. And here geometry plays a major role, i.e. Field's famous nominalization of Newtonian gravitational theory cashed-out notions from mathematical physics in terms of the geometry of points, regarded as concrete objects. 

Possibility and necessity in St. Thomas's sense cannot be understood without Aristotle's doctrine of matter and form (hylemorphism). Possibility (or necessity) in the modern philosophical sense (the Humean sense) is more about whether we can conceive another world in which something can be (or must be). Regarding how "All the objects collectively have a tendency to go out of existence simultaneously at some point." follows from "Every object has a tendency to stop existing at some point or the other.": Perhaps rephrasing it as the following would help: Every object can potentially stop existing at any time (including at, say, the particular time t₁). All objects collectively can potentially stop existing at the same time (at t₁ in this case). 

Is epistemology—the study of knowledge, how knowledge is acquired—really the same as logic? If not, what are the differences between epistemology and logic? By logic, I mean the art by which we order or thoughts or the "science of reason", as St. Thomas Aquinas calls it in the proem of his commentary on Aristotle's Posterior Analytics. 

Aristotle's Peri Hermeneias (On Interpretation), part of his Organon or logical works, is what today would probably be classified as grammar, linguistics, or even semiotics. He discusses what a "name" is: 

Provability logic will probably do the trick. Basically, provability logic takes the box in modal logic to represent provability in some system S. So you'd read S as the strongest foundational system you accept (ZFC or whatever). And you'd read "p is true" as "Box p" and "p is false" as "Box ~p." I don't know if this is a terribly principled way of going about things, but I'll leave the motivation up to you. Edit: I do want to encourage you to relax the requirement that "undecidable statements are neither true nor false." If there's one thing we've learned over the past century, it's that truth and proof can come apart. And it's no better to tie (truth-or-falsity) to provability. 

Good question! Nothing too deep here ... it's just that counterfactuals with true antecedents are rather boring. On most semantics, counterfactuals with true antecedents just collapse into material conditionals, so there's usually no point in writing them as counterfactuals. But you can write out any counterfactuals that you'd like if the fancy strikes you. 

Let's start lower down. By the incompleteness theorems, PA (first-order arithmetic) can't prove its own consistency. Do we have to worry that PA is inconsistent? Fortunately not: we have a stronger system (ZFC) which proves the consistency of PA. But that's not much help -- if you doubt the consistency of PA, this just means you should doubt the consistency of ZFC as well. What we really want to say is: we have very good reason to believe that PA is consistent. Namely, we've been working with PA for many years and uncovered no inconsistency. And the axioms seem to be saying pretty common-sense things about a class of objects (the natural numbers) whose existence most of us take for granted. Now move up to someone who doubts the consistency of ZFC. I could point to some higher system (say, ZFC + "there exists a strongly inaccessible cardinal") which proves the consistency of ZFC. But again, that wouldn't help, since if you doubt the consistency of ZFC you doubt the consistency of the second system. It's much better to say: we've been working with ZFC for a long time and uncovered no inconsistency. And ZFC seems to be saying some pretty common-sense thing about a class of objects (sets) whose existence most mathematicians now take for granted.
