Nowadays, most people seem to think of philosophy as an academic discipline that you study in university and that to be a philosopher is to be a professor of philosophy. However, according to eg. French philosopher and historian of ancient philosophy Pierre Hadot, that is not always how it as been : in ancient philosophy, it was perfectly normal be a considered a great philosopher without ever having written anything of significance and/or without having had any formal training in philosophy, for what mattered was not the discourse of philosophy in itself, but living philosophically. For those who live philosophically, philosophy is something that comes as spontaneously and natural as breathing. For those who live philosophically, philosophy is not an academic discipline involving the study of philosophical theories, but the organic trans-generational enterprise of making sense of the universe that they engage in on an almost daily basis. For those who live philosophically, the act of philosophizing is not something consciously started or stopped, and thus not something one can consciously take a break from. This is in dire contrast with those treat philosophy as just an academic discipline. They see philosophy as just the study of what people wiser than them wrote in the past, distinct from the living experience of themselves and their peers. In my opinion, they fail to grasp the true nature, the true depth and the true value of philosophy. In my opinion, they fail to grasp what makes the great philosophers of the past such great philosophers! For an introduction to living philosophically, I'd recommend Jostein Gaarder's Sophie's World, which follows the (fictional) events of a teenage girl living in Norway and a middle-aged philosopher who introduces her to both the very nature philosophical thinking and the history of philosophy. So, to summarize my position : I believe the answer is "no". I believe that being a great philosopher requires one to live philosophically, and thus never really take a conscious break from philosophy. 

Faith & reason To understand the difference between religion, ideology, philosophy and science, it is important to first distinguish between two fundamentally different approaches towards the interpretation and analysis of information : faith & reason. Faith Wikipedia uses the following definition : 

Now, there are no objective, culturally independent standards for good and evil whatsoever. To some degree, all morality is arbitrary. So neither the racist position nor the anti-racist position are inherently (= objectively) evil or good. Neither Liberals nor Marxists nor Neo-Conservatives nor Zionists nor Nazis nor Jews nor Christians nor Muslims are inherently (= objectively) evil or good. All judgements on good or evil are inherently subjective. See eg. my article on Discordianism or this excerpt from Hogfather for some arguments for that. So you can't argue that racism is objectively wrong from a moral point of view, since morality is fundamentally subjective. You CAN, however, argue that racism is factually wrong. There are two ways to approach this : 

In a country ruled by plutocrats, voting gives us little people the illusion of control. It gives the masses the illusion that there is someone is charge who takes care of their opinions, their wants and their needs. "Voting" is a form of pacification that works by convincing people they have the power to get rid of poor leadership by coloring a little circle every few years, instead of starting a revolution, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson did a couple of centures ago. 

Stirner proposed that most commonly accepted social institutions – including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society – were mere illusions. He refered to them as "spooks" and defined "spooks" as abstract concepts / social constructs that people act as though really existed. They're essentially "ghosts of the mind" that nevertheless feel so real to an individual that they control the way that person acts and that can spread from one person to another. Dawkins defined a "meme" as an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Memes, according to Dawkins, are concepts that exist only in our minds, but that spread and mutate in ways similar to the way viruses spread and mutate: they infect a host and get passed on from one host to another, in a symbiotic or parasitic relationship with that host. Religions and ideologies are both described as meme complexes, which are collections of memes often found together. To me, both concepts seem to be just different names for the same phenomenon. However, I can't say I've ever done any in depth analysis on the different characteristics of respectively a "spook" and a "meme". Hence my question... Are there any differences / incompatibilities to consider between Stirner's "spooks" and Dawkins' "memes" or are they really just different names for what's basically the same concept? 

Brahma Hinduism has three primary Gods, known as the Trimurti. These Gods are references to the three primary forces in nature that hold the universe together : 

Personal freedoms are constrained by society, as they must be. The stronger that technology makes society, the less freedoms. Technology destroys nature, which strengthens technology further. This ratchet of technological self-amplification is stronger than politics. Any attempt to use technology or politics to tame the system only strengthens it. Therefore technological civilization must be destroyed, rather than reformed. Since it cannot be destroyed by tech or politics, humans must push industrial society towards its inevitable end of self-collapse. Then pounce on it when it is down and kill it before it rises again. 

Explain how the notion of race superiority is essentially a form of of collective narcissism and in-group favoritism, which can be based on objective criteria but often is based on highly subjective, irrational preferences. The following image is a perfect illustration of this : . Explain how each race has its own unique combination of strengths and weaknesses, and that there is no objective way to determine superiority because - especially at the level of groups - the strengths always come with corresponding weaknesses, making the notion that one race is superior to the other impossible to determine objectively! source : Thirty years of research on race differences in Cognitive Ability 

No matter which criteria (gender, race, nationality, religion, ideology, hobby, ...) humans apply to associate themselves with others, any such association inevitably results in a division between members of that group (the ingroup) and everyone else (outgroups). Typically, this results in biases favoring the ingroup over the outgroup, known as In-group favoritism. This phenomenon has been well-researched and well-understood by scientists in the fields of social psychology and sociology. For more details, I suggest you do some research on crowd psychology, social identity and how they correlate with each other. This cartoon perfectly captures the phenomenon perfectly:
