Another example from real analysis would be the question of the pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a continuous function (defined on a closed interval). Many people, including Dirichlet and even the master rigorist Weierstrass himself, believed that the Fourier series of such a function converges pointwise everywhere to the function itself. Some clung on to this belief so strongly that they even viewed it as an infallible axiom. Hence, one can imagine the great upset when, in 1876, Paul du Bois-Reymond proved the existence of a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at a point. His proof is non-constructive and uses a method called the principle of condensation of singularities. I have absolutely no idea how the method works, but I do know of a very common proof that uses the Baire Category Theorem (using the Baire Category Theorem, one can also prove the existence of continuous functions that are not differentiable at any point). After the dust had settled in the wake of du Bois-Reymond's seismic discovery, people started fervently believing that there should exist a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere - an opinion that lay on the other extreme! Andrei Kolmogorov inadvertently lent support to this claim by exhibiting, in 1926, an $ {L^{1}}([- \pi,\pi]) $-function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere. However, there was great upheaval once more in Fourier-land when the combined efforts of Lennart Carleson and Richard Hunt in the late 1960's showed that the Fourier series of any $ f \in {L^{p}}([- \pi,\pi]) $ converges almost everywhere to $ f $, for all $ p > 1 $ (this result subsumes the case of continuous functions). During an interview with the AMS, Carleson revealed that he had originally tried to disprove his result (pertaining to $ p = 2 $), but in the end, his failure to produce a counterexample convinced him that he should be working in the other direction instead. Therefore, in the field of Fourier analysis, viewpoints have changed and cherished beliefs have been destroyed - twice. 

Proof. The equivalence between (i),(ii),(iii),(iv) is trivial (although that iii/iv implies i/ii is specific to dimension 2). For a finite group in dimension 2 in characteristic zero, non-irreducibility implies that the action is diagonalizable; hence (a) implies (i). The only fixed points by the group of diagonal matrices with determinant 1 are the two coordinate axes; then are switched by the monomial group, hence (b) implies (iv), and (c) implies (iv) follows (and is clear anyway). Conversely, suppose that none of (a),(b),(c) holds. If $G$ is finite, this means that $G$ is abelian, its irreducible representations have dimension 1 and the negation of (i) follows. Otherwise, we discuss on the Lie algebra of $H$. If it is conjugate to the upper unipotent or upper triangular subalgebra, then the corresponding connected group fixes a unique point, which is then fixed by $H$ and we obtain the negation of (ii). Since (c) does not hold, it is then conjugate to the subalgebra of diagonal matrices. Hence the Zariski connected component of $H$ consists of the group $D$ diagonal matrices with determinant 1; it has index two in its normalizer (monomial matrices). Since (b) does not hold, we deduce that $H=D$, and again is abelian and does not act irreducibly. $\Box$ 

This problem was posed on Math StackExchange some time ago, but it did not garner any solutions there. I think that it is interesting enough to be posed here on Math Overflow, so here it goes. Let $ \mathcal{A} $ be a unital Banach algebra over $ \mathbb{C} $, with $ \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ denoting the identity of $ \mathcal{A} $. For each $ a \in \mathcal{A} $, define the spectrum of $ a $ to be the following subset of $ \mathbb{C} $: $$ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \lbrace \lambda \in \mathbb{C} ~|~ \text{$ a - \lambda \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\mathcal{A}} $ is not invertible} \rbrace. $$ With the aid of the Hahn-Banach Theorem and Liouville's Theorem from complex analysis, one can prove the well-known result that $ {\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}}(a) \neq \varnothing $ for every $ a \in \mathcal{A} $. All proofs that I have seen of this result use the Hahn-Banach Theorem in one way or another (a typical proof may be found in Walter Rudin's Real and Complex Analysis). Hence, a natural question to ask would be: Can we remove the dependence of this result on the Hahn-Banach Theorem? Is it a consequence of ZF only? Otherwise, if it is equivalent to some weak variant of the Axiom of Choice (possibly weaker than the Hahn-Banach Theorem itself), has anyone managed to construct a model of ZF containing a Banach algebra that has an element with empty spectrum? 

Here is a proof that $K=\mathbf{F}_q((t))$ admits only countably many extensions in each finite degree. Here $q$ is a power of a prime $p$. It is enough to prove this countability result for minimal extensions $K'\subset K$, i.e., those with no intermediate field between $K'$ and $K$. Indeed, suppose the result is proved for minimal extensions and let $d$ be minimal such that for some $q$, $K$ admits uncountably many non-isomorphic extensions $(K_i)$ of degree $d$. Then all but countably of those admit a minimal subextension $L_i$ of some degree $1<d'<d$, which, by the minimal case have to form countably many classes, and by induction there are only countably many extensions of degree $d/d'$ for $L_i$, which yields a contradiction. Now let us prove the countability result in the minimal case. Given $K'\supset K$, we have $K'=K[x]$ for some $x$ (because $K'$ is minimal), say with $x$ of degree $d\ge 2$ over $k$, with monic minimal polynomial $P$. If $P$ has the form $Q(X^p)$, then $K[x^p]$ generates a subfield of degree $d/p$ and hence by minimality $d/p=1$, so $K'=\mathbf{F}_q((t^{1/p}))$. Now suppose that $P$ does not have the form $Q(X^p)$. Hence $P'\neq 0$. Therefore since $P$ is the minimal polynomial of $x$, we deduce that $P'(x)\neq 0$ and hence $K'\supset K$ is separable. Given $d\ge 0$, let $\mathcal{P}_d$ be the affine space of monic polynomials of degree $d$ in $K[X]$. Now I want to prove the following: (*) given any separable irreducible $P\in\mathcal{P}_d$, there exists a neighborhood $\Omega_P$ of $P$ in $\mathcal{P}_d$ such that for every $Q\in\Omega_P$ is irreducible and satisfies $K[X]/Q\simeq K[X]/P$. This is enough: indeed it shows that the subset $\mathcal{P}_d^{m,s}$ of monic separable polynomials is open and that the map on $\mathcal{P}_d^{m,s}$ defined by $Q\mapsto K[X]/Q$, valued in isomorphism classes of extensions of $K$, is locally constant, and hence has at most countably many values (because an open subset of $\mathcal{P}_d$ cannot have uncountably many disjoint nonempty open subsets). So we have to prove (*). Write $K'=K[X]/P$, $\hat{K}$ and algebraic closure of $K'$ and let $x=x_1,\dots,x_d$ be the distinct conjugates of $x$ in $\hat{K}$, and $r=\inf_{1\le i<j\le k}|x_i-x_j|$. Let $\Omega_P$ be the set of $Q\in\mathcal{P}_d$ such that $|Q(x_i)|<r^d$ for all $i$; this is a neighborhood of $P$. I claim that every $Q\in\Omega_P$ has a root in the open $r$-ball around $x_i$ for every $i$. Indeed, write $Q=\prod(X-x'_i)$ in $\hat{K}[X]$. Then if we fix $i$ and we assume by contradiction that $|x_i-x'_j|\ge r$ for all $j$, we deduce that $|Q(x_i)|\ge r^d$, a contradiction. Hence $Q$ has a root $x'_i$ with $|x'_i-x_i|<r$, and these roots have to be pairwise distinct, and hence unique because $Q$ has at most $d$ roots. Krasner's lemma (thanks to Vesselin Dimitrov for the link) implies that $K[x_1]\subset K[x'_1]$. This first proves that $K[x'_1]$ has dimension (at least) $d$, which proves that $Q$ is irreducible for every $Q\in\Omega_P$. Since they have the same dimension, this is an equality: $K[x_1]=K[x'_1]$. Thus $K[X]/P$ and $K[X]/Q$ are isomorphic as $K$-fields for all $Q\in\Omega_P$. 

On the first page of Chapter 1 of Rieffel's Deformation Quantization for Actions of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $, Rieffel defines a family of seminorms on the space $ A^{\infty} $ of smooth vectors of a Fréchet space $ A $, for some action $ \alpha $ of the Lie group $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ on $ A $, as follows. Suppose we already have a family $ (\| \cdot \|_{i})_{i \in \mathbb{N}} $ of seminorms on $ A $ that determine its topology. Choose a basis $ \lbrace X_{1},\ldots,X_{d} \rbrace $ of $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $. Then for each $ k \in \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace $, let $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ denote the operator of partial differentiation on $ A^{\infty} $ in the direction of $ X_{k} $; we thus identify $ \mathbb{R}^{d} $ with its Lie algebra in the usual way. For convenience, denote $ \alpha_{X_{k}} $ simply by $ \partial_{k} $. Next, for any multi-index $ \mu = (\mu_{1},\ldots,\mu_{d}) \in \mathbb{N}_{0}^{d} $, let $ \partial^{\mu} $ denote the higher-order partial derivative $ \partial_{1}^{\mu_{1}} \cdots \partial_{d}^{\mu_{d}} $. Then equip $ A^{\infty} $ with the seminorms $$ \forall (j,k) \in \mathbb{N} \times \lbrace 1,\ldots,d \rbrace ~~ \& ~~ \forall a \in A^{\infty}: \quad \| a \|_{j,k} \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \sup_{1 \leq i \leq j} \sum_{|\mu| \leq k} \frac{\| \partial^{\mu} a \|_{i}}{\mu!}, $$ where $ |\mu| \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1} + \cdots + \mu_{d} $ and $ \mu! \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \mu_{1}! \cdots \mu_{d}! $. My question is: As we are applying partial derivatives to $ a \in A^{\infty} $, are we identifying $ a $ with the function $ f_{a}: \mathbb{R}^{d} \rightarrow A $ defined by $ {f_{a}}(\mathbf{x}) \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \alpha(\mathbf{x},a) $? Thank you very much in advance! 

Every locally compact group topology on $G$ makes the constants $\mathbf{C}^*$ an open subgroup. Indeed, as observed in Fetisov's answer, $G$ is a direct product $\mathbf{C}^*\times A$ with $A$ free abelian. So $\mathbf{C}^*$ is the intersection of all kernels of homomorphisms $G\to\mathbf{Z}$. R. Alperin (1980) proved that every homomorphism from a locally compact group into $\mathbf{Z}$ is continuous. It follows that $\mathbf{C}^*$ is closed in $G$. So, working in the quotient, it is enough to prove: the only locally compact group topology $T$ on a free abelian group $A$ is the discrete one. Indeed, every subgroup of $A$ is free abelian. So $(A,T)$ cannot have a non-trivial compact subgroup (e.g., using again Alperin's result). It follows (by Hilbert's fifth problem, but which was previously known, probably due to Pontryagin) that the zero component $(A,T)^\circ$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{R}^k$, and again this forces $k=0$, so $A$ is discrete. Now $\mathbf{C}^*$ admits plenty of exotic locally compact group topologies, but any reasonable assumption (e.g., $\sigma$-compact + evaluation at some point is continuous) will force the topology to be the canonical one.

(Beware that this reference is stated for arbitrary nondiscrete locally compact fields, but has a flaw in the case of positive characteristic.

The mathematical economist Kenneth Arrow showed in a landmark paper (stemming from his PhD thesis) that one obtains a contradiction if all five assumptions are assumed to hold. In fact, Assumptions (1) - (4) imply the existence of a dictator. However, these assumptions seem fairly reasonable and consistent, so the fact that they are contradictory is why Arrow named his paper “A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare”. His result is known nowadays as Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. 

In the mathematical theory of social welfare, it is possible to create a list of axioms that lead to a contradiction. For example, in voting theory, the following axioms for a voting system are considered reasonable in order for the system to qualify as being fair: 

Each voter can have any set of rational preferences. This requirement is called “universal admissibility”. If a voter prefers Candidate A to Candidate B, and Candidate B to Candidate C, then he/she prefers A to C. This requirement is called “transitivity”. If every voter prefers A to B, then the group prefers A to B. This is sometimes called the “unanimity” condition. If every voter prefers A to B, then any change in preferences that does not affect this relationship must not affect the group preference for A over B. For example, if a set of historians unanimously decides that Abraham Lincoln was a better president than Chester A. Arthur, a changing opinion of Bill Clinton should not affect this decision. This more subtle requirement is called “independence from irrelevant alternatives”. There are no dictators. In other words, no voter exists whose preferences determine the preferences of the whole group. 

(Also from my comment, when the question was closed) From Robert Israel's single example $2p+1=5907$ I found in Sloane Encyclopaedia the general picture: A Catalan pseudoprime is an odd non-prime $2q+1$ satisfying $$2q+1\;\big|\;(-1)^qC_q-2,$$ where $C_m$ is the Catalan number $\frac1{m+1}\begin{pmatrix}2m \\ m\end{pmatrix}$. Using that $q+1$ and $2q+1$ are coprime and $2(q+1)\equiv 1[2q+1]$, we see that the above divisibility condition is equivalent to the initial condition $(2q+1)\mid\binom{2q}{q}+(-1)^{q-1}$. So the Catalan pseudoprimes are precisely those odd non-primes $2q+1$ satisfying $(2q+1)\mid\binom{2q}{q}+(-1)^{q-1}$. There are only 3 known Catalan pseudoprimes; they form Sloane's sequence A163209; here are their prime factorization 

Let $T$ be a tree admitting a cocompact proper action of a discrete group $G$. Then $G$ has a finite index subgroup $F$ free of finite rank. Let $(F_n)$ be a sequence of finite index subgroups such that $\limsup F_n=\{1\}$ (i.e. for every $g\neq 1$, eventually $g\notin F_n$); for instance $(F_n)$ is decreasing and $\bigcap F_n=\{1\}$; these exist because free groups are residually finite. Then the quotients $F_n\backslash T$ is a family of graphs covered by $T$ of girth tending to $\infty$. On the other hand, for a leafless tree $T$ of bounded valency, to have a cocompact automorphism group is not enough: precisely a necessary and sufficient condition for $T$ to cover a finite graph is that the automorphism group of $T$ is cocompact and unimodular (necessity is due to Bass and Kulkarni 1990).
