My bike is only 7 months old, but the front derailleur cable fibres are becoming loose i.e. the individual thin metal fibres twised together to form the cable are loosing out. I think I have lost the metal cap which was holding the twisted end of the cable so that those fibres stay twisted. How can I fix this? Could anyone suggest? TA 

Put your gears to 1:1 position. This is the safest position to start with the optimum cable tension. Also, you will have less chances of messing things up. loosen the joint that is holding the derailleur cable for the front derailleur clutch. This is actually located near where your cassettes are (gear coggs). Clean the clutch joints and housings properly. If you have a thin-brissled brush, it is good. Otherwise, use a cleaning cloth. Clean as thoroughly as possible and make sure all the debris and small granules are not blocking any of the intersections/joints. Tighten the cable back in the joint, ideally and exactly where it was before. Check the up/down shifts for all the gear to ensure that you have got the correct tension level. 

It would have been slightly helpful if you told us from what front and back gear ratio (e.g. 2:3 or 2:4) the problem starts occurring. I had similar problems and it was even the case when I was changing to higher front gear but the cassettes (or clogs) did not change or they changed after a long time when it received external shocks from my ride. Did you check how the shifts are happening from 1(front):1(rear) onwards i.e. if you were to use the gear ratio from 1:1 to upwards? If you do this, then you will come to the point where you feel exactly from which gear ratio it is taking longer to switch cogs. Also, you might even find out once in a while changing to a higher gear actually does not change to the new cassette at all and gets stuck. One of the cable (front/rear derailleur) tension would not feel right to you. For me it was some dirt and blockage in the front derailleur lever area (i.e. the allen key-based connnector with wire clenched around) which is universally near pedals. Usually, this is a minor problem and the way to fix it was to make sure first your gear ratio is 1:1. Then, loosen the allen key just enough so that the wire comes out. Now clean around the allen key are well enough and then use a little bit of wet lube around it to finalise. Then, put the wire back in and tighten the allen key as it was before. Reccheck the gear shifting from 1:1 upwards and see if the problem is solved. This could happen even to the rear derailleur too. The key problem originator is the derailleur lever (i.e. the allen key based moving area). What happens normally is that dirt and blockage occur there and the cable tension feels higher than it should normally feel. Also, please update your question by saying for how long and where (i.e. what type of tarmac) you have used your MTB until the problem started manifesting. Also, I am assuming that you know NEVER to change both gears at the same time? If you don't know and have done this already, please don't do this again. For the investigation I mentioned above, make sure you change the gears down or up appropriately. Let us know :)....Don't forget to add the additional information to your original question :) UPDATE If these are of any help see This one And also this Hope this helps 

FUTURE REFERENCE: Depending on how heavy your ride schedule is, you should do it ideally every 4 months or so. In this way, you keep your bike in good condition as well as the safety. You don't want to be in the middle of the traffic and bashing your head wondering why your gear is not shifting down :p I hope this helps. 

I was wondering whether 20" wheels can get away with smaller rotors than 28" wheels, and if there is a correlation, if it is linear. If it was linear, then 140mm discs on a 20" wheel would be equivalent to 200mm discs on a 28" wheel (and it would be unnecessary to mount anything bigger for pretty much any application). At a given forward speed, the circular speed of the rotor scales up linearly with decreasing wheel size, which on smaller wheels should help with the cooling and should provide higher friction power and thus higher braking power. But I can't find any source confirming this, so I'm asking here. 

I don't know about your area, but here around it's quite common to see bikes locked up with some carrier bags attached (not locked) to them. I wouldn't ever do this because my bags are high-quality bags (water-proof, durable, etc.) which are expensive even without content. But this leads me to the following idea: Get a cheap looking bag for your bike, handlebar, saddle, rack, whereever. Then discretely lock that bag shut and to your bike. 

Go to your dealer. Ask them to verify it's aligned properly and works in general. Test whether it still skips. If yes, demonstrate it in front of the dealer. Insist you need a replacement. 

(in short: best solution is in the first bullet point) There are quite a lot of possibilities, as reflected by the myriad of different answers. Here is an attempt at summing them up together with my experiences with them (where available). The problem appears when there is cold wind blowing on the scrotum+perineum and when they are wet and cooled by evaporation. If you are a women who wants to warm your corresponding area: I don't think this answer is actually too gender-specific if you mentally replace any references to male body parts. Should probably work for you too. Just dressing other parts of the body warmer doesn't help. I tested this a couple of times and it really seems to be true. And it makes sense: heating the testicles (and torso in general) is a priority for the body, if that stops working then you have much bigger problems because you definitely have hypothermia. So the solutions need to be about keeping the wind away from this specific area and keeping it dry. The obvious luxury solution is the answer by Criggie: Get a fairing. This keeps the wind away and if it's good the rain too (also: speeeeeeed :). Other solutions work like an additional layer of clothing: Inner layers: 

So they are interpreting it in a careful way: You should not ride side by side (to switch to the back of the riding formation) if there is any (motorized) traffic overtaking you. Probably there is some other law somewhere defining what exactly is meant by hindering traffic, but I couldn't find it on the spot. Basically I think this boils down to: Only do it on official cycling roads (marked by brown/red signs, no or little motor traffic) and in large groups. That large group should have someone more experienced who can tell when it's okay and when not. 

I have an Alfine 11 (so very similar) and I had the hub replaced 2 times on warranty because of this skipping problem. The third one is fine so far (~15000km on it). So based on my experience: Have it replaced a second time. It also does skip when misaligned as mentioned in the other answer and yes it's tricky to get right and tends to misalign over time. Also it can freeze in the winter (still works, but need to change gears by hand on the lever on the hub) and this could also cause skipping because it would stick between gears. But your bike dealer should be able to fix/diagnose this within seconds. So my suggestion: 

I think I found the solution. I lost my cable crimps and need to fix it probably by duct taping it and also using anti-fray caps. 

I would suggest that you strap it to your back ONLY if it is not distracting you when cycling. What I mean by distracting is the back sliding left or right and making you feel that it is moving around your body. This could be an annoying factor for just anybody. If you have this issue, try to fasten it around the protective rail at the front. Citi bikes are reasonably sturdy, so the weight distribution would not be affected I hope. We have similar bikes in London and I am sure I have seen people doing both; bags strapped around the body and fastened securely around the front area (where the protective rail is). Why not just try it? I would certainly do that. P.S. Make sure you secure it properly if placed around the protective rails at the front. You don't want your bag to be accidentally slipping away on a main road during rush hour, especially if you have a laptop or PDA inside :P 

From your question above, i would only suggest the following (doesn't mean I don't know about the other bikes): Folding bike - for work and city/cycle lane/fairly normal surfaces only. You can also get away with usual city road hazards such as potholes and cracks (but not too extreme), also good weight support (e.g. laptop, clothes, etc.). You might find it a bit weird to suddenly switch to a folding from a normal road/hybrid/MTB. But overall, it is really great as my gf bought a Tern C8 last month(she is 5'4") and even I find it nice to ride (I am 6'3"). You can also carry it on the train and even on the aeroplane if you want. Some folding bike tyres are quite sturdy compared to hybrids so the bumps and holes can be ignored a lot more. I would still give a trial ride if I was you in order to be sure about the comfort. THIS IS QUITE PRACTICAL if you are just living a professional life and city-side commute with occasional shopping bags (about 6 kgs) behind you. MTB (Mountain Bikes) - If you want it to use on a rougher surface as well as in the cities. They are a bit heavy, but can take poundings like no other. You could even go over some road kerbs that are raised by appx. 3-4 inches. I apologise to be mean, but if you are not young enough to handle the bike weight, you might feel it difficult to go around the hills with these heavy bikes. But if you think you can, Go for this one. My suspicion based on UK prices is that you can probably get a very good MTB compared even when you double the price (if you are lucky, you might get one with suspension springs too, COOOL). It is also possible to attach some rack or similar thing behind your MTB so that you can carry weight such as your laptop and clothes to work. I never saw anybody doing it for MTB, but that really does not mean you cannot. Short answer is, if you are happy to sacrifice outdoor activity, folding bike is the answer. Otherwise, get an MTB, get rack, and voi la. Bear in mind that no matter what bike you buy, there is a maximum weight for that. I would recommend staying about 6-7 Kgs under the prescribed weight by the manufacturer/seller. It was never an issue for me anyway as I carried shopping on my folding and hybrid, about 6-7 kgs of shopping. I am really sorry but cannot guide you about the US price. If any other user finds this answer suitable, but want to edit it to put the price information, be my guest. Normally, I would put the UK prices but this would be confusing as you said yourself that the prices and the types of bike vary in the US shops. Hope this helps. If you were interested in the brands at all: Folding - Dahon, Tern, Raleigh, Brompton (around $800 sometimes due to the high demand) MTB - Jamis, Trek, Pinnacle, Raleigh (Off-road series), Fuji, Bianchi The choice is now yours, If you think I can give you more information please post follow-up comments :)
