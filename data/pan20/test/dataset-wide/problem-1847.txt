Using notes indcates that you did prepare. It also indicates that you intend to say something beyond what is on the Power Point slides. It also indicates you have points you don't want to forget to mention. All those are good things. 

Don't say you can't go because you have an appointment. Tell them honestly that you have class at that time and that you cannot skip it. They may find having a class more imporatnat than just an appointment. They may not remeber that you take classes. When they say your presence is important, they generally mean that. Even if they don't fire you over that (and whether they can will depend on the laws in your country), that will make an unfavorable impression of you and that will carry over into how they assign work, how they reward performance and how they perceive you in general. You wil be perceived as someone who is not a team player and that can be a very hard perception to overcome. You have to make the call as to whether you are planning to move up in this company or if your education is more important. If this job is just tiding you over until you get a degree in a completely differnt field and look for a totally different job (like working as a waitress while you get your medical degree), then you may not care as much as if this were company where your new degree will allow you to move up to a better job in the same field or with the same company (such as getting a computer science degree in place where you are junior programmer). How bad is it really to skip one class? If you aren't having a test, can you make arrangements with another student to share notes? Can you talk to the professor about the issue and see if he can give you some outside help to catch up if you have to do this for your job? 

You are a guest in his turf. You don't have to understand why his rules exist or even agree with them, you have to understand that he has the right to make them. If it makes things harder for you, then that is the price of doing business on someone else's property. The very best way to get this guy on your side is to cooperate with him fully. To follow his rules no matter how silly you think they are. You need to have an attitude of cooperation. No eye rolling, no sarcasm, no objecting. You can ask respectfully how to do something. Ask him for guidance before you start setting up. Show him some respect. Your suspicions of his motives need to be turned off. Why he does what he does is none of your business. It is his place and therefore his rules. Perhaps instead of him being bored, he feels the antagonism you have have for him and his "unimportant' job and is pushing back. Or maybe some other organizations have done things that made him have to tighten the rules. Or maybe he is just having a bad time in his personal life. Who cares. None of your business. 

Personally I make it a policy to never bad mouth past employers in writing anywhere. I have run into past colleagues at new workplaces many times. It makes no sense to do something that might mean I am unable to get a job at a place I wanted to work at because ten years ago I insulted the person who is now friends with the hiring manager. Write the review, pour your heart out into into and then don't post. I personally also would be wary of giving any credence at all to anything posted on Glassdoor. I have seen plenty of places where most people were happy but there was someone who felt put upon who posted this sort of garbage but if you knew the situation from outside, you would know he wasn't treated unfairly and the the company wasn't a horrible to place to work. Good reviews are also suspect because they could be from people who are trying to make the company look better as part of their job. 

Some of this may be cultural (both cultural to the country you are in or to the organization) and some may be that you are new and have not yet developed a reputation as someone who can provide answers. The first step is to talk to your manager about the workplace culture and determine if the reason why they are going to him directly is simply the way that company/country does business. If this is the case, then you need to simply accept that this indirect approach is the way things are done and work with your boss to make sure he has the information at his fingertips to answer their questions. It never harms you in the workplace to make sure your boss looks good. Also in this case, take notes about how he answers questions and which ones he defers for later. You can still learn how things are handled even if you are not the one answering the questions. Work out a method with him where you can pass information on to him quietly if he appears to be going in a wrong direction. Some bosses might want you to pass them a note with the further information, some might want to let it wait until after the meeting and some might expect you to jump in the discussion with the additional information. If the boss thinks there is a problem with how you are presenting the information or with your work, then this discussion will likely bring that out too. This is good to know as you can't fix a problem until you know what it is. If he is answering because he does not trust you to have the answer or trust that you know how to deal with the politics of the situation, you need to find out exactly what actions you need to take to improve your performance and build trust with your supervisor. These actions are likely to be workplace specific. When I was young, I sat down with my boss and had a few training sessions where he pretended to be the person who would ask questions in a meeting (eventually getting quite aggressive or hostile) and let me answer them and get tips on better ways to respond. Once he was sure I could handle the questions, he was able to let me handle more things in a group setting. You could ask to get this type of training if he is not sure you can handle yourself if things get heated. You could also clarify with him what type of questions he should start giving you to handle and what he needs to to keep at his level. If you can get his reasoning on this, you will be learning more about how that workplace works and the politics of the situation which is critical for anyone who deals with data analysis (this is my professional specialty so I know). If, as seems most likely since you are new, the issue is simply that they don't trust your well enough to ask you directly, then you need to work with your boss to help gain their trust. First, start by delivering excellent work on time. Getting a reputation for delivering the goods is the fastest way to becoming respected and to them then going to you. You could consider asking about when you can start to handle some of the less controversial meetings without his presence. They will be more likely to ask you questions directly if he is not there. Work out with your boss what types of questions are your responsibility to answer under these circumstances and which (generally those relating to policy changes and schedule and priority) you will need to refer to him. If he does let you handle some less important meetings, be sure to let him know in an email what questions were asked and how you handled them and any questions that you deferred to him (As they may not get around to asking the of him directly). You can consider asking your boss, to verbally pass the question to you in the presence of these people. Having the support of your boss and his trust that you can handle the question is another good way for people to realize that you are to be trusted. Be aware though that some supervisors are not willing to give up their perceived power by passing things to you publicly. In this case, making sure he has the information he needs to make both of you look good is your best choice. If he looks good enough, he will likely get promoted out of your hair. If you have given him the support he needs to look good, He may well recommend you for promotion to his position when he leaves. Even an overly micromanagement boss can be someone you can learn from. Again take notes as to how he answers questions and how he deflects things he is not ready to answer at that moment. Even if you are no doing the answering, you can learn how more senior people deal with questions. 

A noise cancelling headset work for many people who are bothered by ambient noise in an office environment. You can play music or not while wearing them. A white noise generator could help as well. Any music that you like should be fine. You might experiment with vocal and non-vocal music to see which you find less distracting. 

When someone is not doing well, the best thing you can do for them is to tell them what is wrong and what needs to be fixed. Don't fix things behind their back (they will never know that what they do is unacceptable), don't pretend everything is fine. Be honest about the problem, ask them for solutions but point them to the solution you want if need be. You don't need to be nasty or personally attack them, but you need to set clear expectations of what is acceptable and what is not. I once had two employees and I promoted one and did not promote the other and I had to sit down with her and tell her exactly what she needed to do to get that promotion. She had a specific list of things that needed improvement and that she had to show me she could accomplish before being a senior person. She eventually got that promotion becasue she knew what standard she had to meet and that I would promote her as soon as she had met that standard. Those conversations are hard, they aren't fun for the manager, but you can't manage well unless you are willing to have those conversations. In the software development world, code reviews are a good place to start. You aren't attacking the person, just seeing what the code does and how it can be improved. Getting the developers to not think they own the code and no one else should see it or touch it, is also a part of code review making it even more important to do in any software shop. And don't just review the poorer performers, if everyone has code reviewed, then the criticisms will be taken better. In the non-software world, you can also take the time to do checks of someone's work on a regular basis especially if the person is new or very junior. It is easier to catch a problem in the first weeks they work for you, than to get upset over a long-standing problem after they have been doing it that way for a year and you never said anything. Give positive feedback when warranted. If you see improvement in a specific area of concern, make sure the person knows you noticed. And be fair. Don't reserve all your praise for one person and all your criticism for another. And don't criticize publically. Praise is given in public, but criticism is given in private. 

OK, those political beliefs may be getting in the way (for instance few companies want to hire a Nazi even if it is legal to be one), but what you have to do first is prove they were told by the HR rep as opposed to finding it some other way such as searching your name in Google. I would suggest contacting a labor lawyer and asking for him/her to help you out. No matter what your political beliefs, the ACLU might be willing to help out. Probably you will need a legal person pose as someone getting reference to see what they say about you and then , the lawyer might send a cease and desist letter. Another avenue for you is to look at the companies that employ others sharing your beliefs. 

First talk to your boss about your hours and find out if indeed they are acceptable. There is a difference between flexible hours and coming in too late. I have worked in lots of places with flex time. In none of them would 11 am or later have been acceptable unless you worked after midnight the day before. I can recall at least one person who got fired for coming in consistently after 10:30 am even though we had some flex in our work hours. There is such a thing as taking too much flex. Your co-workers may be trying to tell you that you are violating the organizational culture and that your late hours are annoying to them because they have to wait for you to get in and that you are not being a team player by working such odd hours. They may actually be trying to help you in your career by getting you to move closer to the organizational norms. You may be causing delays to them that you don't know about. You may be making it so all meetings have to be in the afternoon when they would rather have concentrated work time or that you you get to escape attending when they don't. Just because you like those hours and feel productive does not mean that your co-workers feel the same way. Next you may feel you are more productive then, but do you coworkers really know that you are staying to work all the hours expected? Sometimes emails at 8 pm will help the perception that you don't work as hard because you come in late. You need to learn to manage your teammates' and boss's perceptions of what you do in order to succeed. You could be perceived as a slacker for coming in late. In my experience, morning people especially feel that way because they are not productive in the late afternoon or later. Think what you can do to make sure you are not perceived that way. Another thing you could do is sit down privately with the worst offenders and ask them straight up why they have a problem with you coming in later if your boss does not. If they have a real problem, it might come out in this conversation and you can suggest a fix. If they say they are just joking, tell that the joke is no longer funny and and to stop. How you handle people will depend on your assessment of their personality though. Some people are just jokesters and the best thing to do with them is to joke back and let all they things you say just roll off your back. Other people are trying to get you to conform to organizational norms and they won't stop until you do. Some people uses jokes as a way to bond and some use them as a way to put people down and make you look bad. You need to understand what they are trying to do with the joking before you can respond effectively. It will help to get a training course on dealing with difficult people or read some books on this topic. Bullies need to be handled differently than jokers or people who just want you to work correctly (in their eyes). You need to do some analysis and ask some questions before you decide what to do.
