I don't think it's the best argument for someone on the pro choice side (apart from being useful at persuading others perhaps). The reason I don't think it's a very strong argument (and I'm pro-choice) is that it doesn't actually engage with the reasons pro-life people have concerns about abortion. Pro-life people are concerned because they believe (or want to be cautious about) that the fetus should be viewed on the same terms as human beings who are born. Thus, saying something like "that argument doesn't hold because women have a right to bodily autonomy" is just sidestepping the main concern. Pro-life feel that all human beings have a right to life. A lot of them would probably agree that in general women should have a right to their body, although when two rights come in to conflict, they'd probably go with the former right, the right to life. It's easy enough to see how the autonomy thing can lead to bizarre suggestions if it's an absolute right. Autonomy implies a woman should be able to disconnect herself from the fetus at 39 weeks, a couple of hours before birth. Most people consider that once a baby is born, it automatically has those rights to life. So it seems odd that a couple of hours difference could alter the morality of letting the fetus/baby die. Another place where most people abandon the bodily autonomy thing is just after the birth. If a mother left the newborn at home, never fed, and the baby died,most people would agree the mother was not acting morally. If she said "well I have a right to what I do with my body, you can't force me to use it to feed the baby" people would say they are misusing the idea of the right to bodily autonomy. One of the reasons people have that reaction is that they think that the baby's right to life trumps any apparent right not to have to do anything with your body to keep the born baby alive. Coming back to abortion, can you see now how the bodily autonomy right argument is not going to convince pro-life people, because the bodily rights argument is, to a lot of people, trumped by the right of the fetus? The real issue is whether or not the fetus deserves the status pro-life people believe it does. People who use the bodily autonomy argument have mostly already decided the answer to that question. Pro-lifers, who are either unsure about the status of the fetus, or believe it has a sacrosanct right to life, will not be convinced by the bodily right argument because of the general hierarchy of rights. As said above, I'm not against abortion being offered to women, although I do think the body argument is not very useful to bring in to the discussion as it bypasses the issue pro-life people have by presupposing the fact that fetuses do not have deserve the same rights newborns do. I think if pro-choice want to debate pro-life, they really need to see why pro-life people view it differently and try to address those issues. For example, come up with reasons that the 12 week old fetus isn't the same as a newborn - it doesn't have the capacity for suffering, it has no conscious interests, etc. I think that would go a lot more towards convincing others. Of course, there are many pro-life people who are pro-life based on religious reasons - "once the sperm has fused with the egg, it is a person". That is less amenable to debate 

Wittgenstein was not arguing against the type of language you are talking about in his private language arguments. At length in various notebooks, Wittgenstein wrote about various possible people who speak a language without a social setting. He discusses Robinson Cruesoe in his notebooks and is completely ok with the idea of Robinson Cruesoe living by himself and using words, or coming up with his own language to describe how he goes about his daily tasks. What is important to Wittgenstein is for it to be a language, it must be in principle possible for you to observe him or interact with him, and get a sense of what he means. For example, maybe he leaves signs on the ground to help him remember where to find various natural resources, or to help him remember melodies of songs he writes, etc. Wittgenstein is also not trying to put forward the argument that language has to be learned in a community. He discussed the possibility (again in his notebooks) of Martians who are born with an innate ability to speak. He doesn't believe that that is impossible or incoherent. How the person comes to develop language is not important. What he is arguing against is the possibility of a language which is necessarily private, ie not reducible in principle to any public notions. For example, someone who tries to privately ostensively define certain sensations he or she has. Or philosophers who claim that language is essentially private (ie the definition of pain is that private sensation you have, which leads to people saying things like ("I don't know if other people's pain is real, as I only know with certainty that my pain is real"). EDIT: Check out the Analytical commentaries on the Philosophical Investigations by PMS Hacker if you really want to delve deeper into some of exegesis of PI. The idea of Robinson Cruesoe, the Martians, etc, is discussed at length 

One of the things he was famous for in the Tractatus is the idea about certain things that you can show but not say e.g. ethics. He rejects the reasoning he used in the Tractatus and rejects the idea of holding philosophical theses at all, and rejects theory-building. But his position on ethics didn't really change as far as I can tell. He also always rejected solipsism as solipsists see it. Also, he always seemed to dislike worship of the scientific method being used outside of science. I would say that there is more continuity between early and later Wittgenstein than is usually stated. His method did entirely change though. 

Why are you more sure about 5+5 = 10 than say, "killing innocent people for fun is bad"? I don't think you can prove existence for something like that the way you want. It's not like you can point to a physical object. Why do you need a proof? Any proof is going to rely on other unfounded assertions, so I'm not sure what you think an absolute proof would be, as each statement of the proof cannot be absolute - you'll eventually reach statements you have to take as true on faith. I don't need anything fancy to show what morality is, and that it has a meaning for people. Say if I ask someone how they feel about people who bully in the work place, or people who torture animals for fun, etc, I can guarantee most people will have strong feelings about how bad those actions are morally. That's just to say that words like " bad" and "good" have meaning in a language. I think a question like "does goodness exist", in the philosophical metaphysical sense, is a question a bit like " what time is it on the sun" (to borrow from Wittgenstein) in that it seems to present a puzzle to us, but when we look closer we see that the expectation that there'd be a suitable meaningful answer is mistaken. 

I don't think you'll necessarily agree with this answer, but in the spirit of Wittgenstein, he'd probably view this as a confusion over language. Take an adjective like colour. We know adjectives can be used to describe nouns. We know the basic adjective noun relationship is "X is y" where "X" is a noun and "y' is an adjective. Knowing that colour adjectives describe nouns, we can say things like "tigers are striped" or "polar bears are white". These are all fine. You could then get confused, wondering what happens when you apply colours to other nouns. " The singer's voice was purple" or "London was indigo". These sentences are excluded from the language by the grammar of colour words. These sentences do not have a use within the language. When you look at your question, you're asking why can't you apply "pretend" in situations like "he pretended to move his feet". I don't really think there is an explanation out there for this kind of question. It's really one of those things that you see or you don't. You understand English so you know the exact situations in which it is acceptable to use the word "pretend". So what purpose would an explanation serve? Perhaps you are looking to see, what is common to all the cases in which you use the word " pretend". The thing is, there may not be one thing in common to all the uses of pretend. As for why the falsehood of x precludes the appearance that x is true? There is no answer to this question apart from restating the same thing in different words. I think it might be easier to see in the colour example - do you think it is a difficult problem to get over, how do we know when to apply colour words correctly? What are the set of criteria that mean you can use one? I think the answer to this problem is not in finding a solution, but reaching a point where you realize where the problem came from and seeing it no longer is confusing. It's really right in front of you all along, assuming you know English. 

In relation to Witrgenstein's comment on the proof, I think this is what he was getting at: Between two finite sets, we say they have the same number of elements if we can put them in one-to-one correspondence. Cantor's proof is interpreted as meaning that there are cardinalities of infinities, with the reals being of a greater kind of infinity. It is deemed to represent an important discovery in the nature of infinite sets. What I think Wittgenstein is saying is that it's not really a discovery about sets so much as a mathematical creation. In using terms like "cardinality" and "set" and "one-to-one correspondence" we're making it sound like we have discovered something about them, as opposed to constructing new forms of these terms with different properties than their usual ones. In his eyes, the problem may be that you're using the term "set" when you say "set of all irrational numbers" in a way that is an extension of the idea of the set. Wittgenstein is possibly saying he doesn't like that extension of the idea, or he is just saying we should be aware that it is an extension of the term. I don't think he's necessarily denying the proof itself, maybe more somebody taking something very metaphysical out of it, thinking they've discovered something new about sets instead of inventing a new set of rules in set theory. 

Similar to this is the family resemblance concept - this is directed primarily against Augustinian notions of language and essentialism. "We find that what connects all the cases of comparing [i.e. the use we make of the word 'comparing' (p. 86)] is a vast number of overlapping similarities, and as soon as we see this, we feel no longer compelled to say that there must be some one feature common to them all. What ties the ship to the wharf is a rope, and the rope consists of fibres, but it does not get its strength from any fibre which runs through it from one end to the other, but from the fact that there is a vast number of fibres overlapping. "(Wittgenstein, The Brown Book p. 87)
