If single cells or populations highly dependent of sensory input can often be modeled with so called receptive fields. For neurons and populations close to some motor output, they can be modeled with limb positions, trajectories or muscle activities. But how can we model what other neurons/populations do if their response is dependent on a highly dimensional input-space which we cannot visualize or grasp? My question is therefore: what does it mean to understand the brain? Do we understand the brain when we have 10000 formulas that describe the mayor functions of populations in the brain but nobody gets their meaning? What if we can reproduce a working brain by copying the main principles without the possibility to illustrate or explain what exactly it does - do we understand it? 

To cope with world-1, evolution equipped behaving animals with the possibility to sense the world. Smart interaction with this world-1 (aka behavior) requires to map a high dimensional sensory input space to a low dimensional motor output space. This mapping requires generalization and abstraction which are implemented as cognitive processes. E.g. a animal has to realize that an apple is an apple independent of the light conditions, its exact shape and a variety of different colors,... i.e. the animal has a notion of an apple. Smart social behavior is an evolutionary advantage but it requires a possibility to exchange such internal generalized notions. This exchange is achieved through the communication of symbolic representations. E.g. an animal warns other animals through a distinct call (symbol for predator) The evolution of such symbolic representations led to the human language and highly sophisticated models of the world-1 (the set of these models is what you call world-2). Part of these models is a set of rules that allows to treat symbols in a consistent fashion aka. mathematics. If we apply mathematics to symbols which originate from abstractions of the world aka science, we can predict reactions in the world aka explain it. It is important to note that a sentence on the world-2 can be proven (e.g. logic/mathematics) by checking whether it is consistent with a set of other sentences in world-2. This is not possible for sentences on the world-1 (science) since our access to the world-1 is restricted through our senses, cognitive processes and our limited possibilities to manipulate the world. So the only thing we can do to have good models of world-1 is to reject the contradictory ones i.e. the ones that predict wrong observations. Even tough we can describe the regularities in the world-1 we cannot explain them. The regularities of world-1 are a necessity for any description - from the cognitive process to the symbolic representation and the communication. So if we would come up with an explanation of the regularities, it would not be falsifiable. The creation of world-2 depends on the regularities in world-1 and therefore the regularities in world-2 are deduced from the ones in world-1 as everything in world-2. The sentence on the regularities in world-2 (point 6) might be considered a sentence of world-3 because it is a statement on the nature of world-2 but this is not true because the cognitive processes of animals and the communication in the human society are processes in the world-1, all sentences on their content are sentences on the content of world-1 and therefore they belong to world-2. In short: Explaining something is a process in the world-1 that requires consistency of world-1. Explanations of the consistency of world-1 are not falsifiable and therefore not valid. 

I think it was Richard Feynman that said the final arbiter of science is observation - aka, it's nothing magical or mystical. Honestly, I do the same thing when I cook dinner ("Hmmm. This didn't turn out very well - it might have been because I cooked the chicken on too high of a temperature. If that's the case, cooking on Medium-Low would solve the problem. I'll try that next time, and see if it comes out better - if not, the problem must be something else.") And once you think about it that way, that it's simply a methodology for figuring out how the world works, it's pretty clear that Science has nothing to do with Religion. (The idea that it does is relatively modern; like another answer said, many famous scientists of the past viewed their works as a way of examining the beauty of creation.) 

Noticing a facet of reality Coming up with an explanation as to why it occurs Devising a test that could prove the explanation wrong Observing the results of your test. 

If some random guy on the street sees a person wearing an "I Love Jesus" shirt and mocks them, the person thinks, "Geez, that guy was a jerk." If a biochemist sees someone wearing an "I Love Jesus" shirt and mocks them, the person thinks, "Geez, scientists can be jerks." (semi-related $URL$ So, right off the bat, be careful you don't equate "What Person X Does" with "What People In Group Y That Include Person X Do". Now that that's said, I think half the problem is the large constructs we've put around the concept of science, or of scientists. Science is simply: 

I think part of the problem is: Science doesn't prove anything. Science, at its core, is simply a method of generating testable hypothesis that explain events, which are valued because of their use in predicting future results. Let me give an example. Based on observations, science came up with a theory for an orbital period, correlating orbital speed and distance. But it didn't prove this - it's simply the best mechanism for predicting an orbit that science knew at the time. Science could compile evidence that would lend credence to the theory - the more observations that matched the theory, the more likely the theory was sound. But science could never say, "We know this for a fact." Sure enough, we observed small perturbations in Mercury's orbit around the sun - deviations that the orbital theory couldn't explain. Then we came up with Relativity, which neatly patched those holes. So now we have a predictive theory for an orbit that's better - but we still can't prove that it's absolutely 100% correct. There could by any number of phenomenon that we haven't run into that would tear holes in the theory. Science never proves anything - the best it can do is say, "Well, this theory is our best explanation for prior events and is the best predictor for future events." So, let's say there's a God - and not only that, he's completely 100% interactive. Dude just pops in every saturday at NIST headquarters via shining beam of light - even buys coffee for the front desk clerk each week. Science still can't prove him. Because there could always be some unexplained phenomenon that's contributing or even causing our observations. 

Human being is freedom. The external world is filled with in-itself being. Consciousness is the only anomaly, and consciousness only manifests itself through human being, insofar as we are aware of it. So, the starting point for an account of human being is in the account of the being of consciousness. We know that the being of consciousness is the consciousness of being, and it will follow that the being of consciousness of humans is the consciousness of being human. This consciousness of being human entails a consciousness of consciousness, and the immediately apparent features of consciousness. Conscious is infinite which means that the options for manifestations of human consciousness are infinite. The feature of having an infinite amount of options for the manifestation of one’s consciousness is what Sartre calls freedom. So, we have determined that the human being is freedom and that humans must be aware that their being is freedom. This does not mean that human beings have an essence of freedom. “Man does not exist first in order to be free subsequently; there is no difference between the being of man and his being-free” (BN: 60). Freedom is the reason that human beings do not have an essence. “Human freedom precedes essence in man and makes it possible; the essence of the human being is suspended in freedom” (BN: 60). The freedom of human being manifests itself as the limitless choice of human action. No matter what the situation is, a human being can always choose to act and his action will define his being. Even in extreme situations of coercion (such as being threatened with death), a human being still has the ability to choose his action and to choose the conscious attitude with which he apprehends the world. This ability to choose is actually an inability not to choose. Sartre tells us that “we are a freedom which chooses, but we do not choose to be free” (BN: 623). We are not free beings. We are freedom itself. Citations refer to this translation of Being and Nothingness 

This is a heavily debated issue and you are not likely to receive a conclusive answer. The question as phrased amounts to "Which view is correct?", but there are strong arguments from either side. I think you will benefit from doing a little research on the topics of Paternalism and Consequentialist Libertarianism, which are the general terms used in philosophy to refer to either standpoint. I have included descriptions of these views and links to places to start below: 

The answer is (B) all sensuous mental processes are sensuous contents. At this point in Ideas, Husserl has qualified his expression as phenomenological description. In the context of apprehending a phenomenon, the content of consciousness is equivalent to act of consciousness. This is because: 

If a sensuous mental process were to contain sensuous contents, then they would have to be distinct. The sensuous contents would have to be a separate experience which preceded the sensuous mental process, which means that the sensuous mental process would not be a sensuous mental process, but a reflective intentional mental process. This is clearly a contradiction, so it must not be the case that sensuous mental processes contain sensuous contents. This stuff can get confusing and just to make sure that this is not misunderstood... According to Husserl's phenomenology as expressed in Ideas, sensuous mental processes ≡ sensuous contents
