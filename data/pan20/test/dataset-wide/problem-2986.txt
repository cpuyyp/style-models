Note that point 3 and 5 are easily questionable. For point 3: Why wouldn't an infinite regress of movers be possible? For point 5: this proof only proves the existence of an unmoved mover, however, God (whether that's the Christian or another God) is more than only an unmoved mover. Therefore, this doesn't prove Gods existence, but merely the existence of an unmoved mover. In Thomas' defense: he didn't intend this as a proof, but as a way to God (remember "quinque viae"). This is a way to get to the idea of God, not to prove God. 

The formulation is a little unclear. What is meant is that Jennifer has always left for school at 7am until now, and has always been on time until now. It is no premise that Jennifer is always on time, nor that she always leaves at 7am. Formally we write arguments down as a set of premises P1, P2, ..., Pn and a conclusion C. In this example, the implicit argument could be formalised as: 

Now it becomes more clear what the author means: the first formulation (the one I quoted) can easily be used in some kind of (perfect) world model: it's very technical and focuses on logical soundness. The second formulation however is geared more toward 'daily use' and gives a somewhat more practical idea, something we can actually try to use. The word 'humanistic' is not used in the strict sense of the word you looked up here. What is meant is more 'human-oriented' or something like this. This formulation of the Categorical Imperative is actually called the Humanity Formula: 

The person making the argument picks a case which supports his point, ignoring the cases that don't support his point. 

There is an answer talking about the speedometer in a car. However, the speedometer always slips a little bit and is therefore not accurate. Also, the speedometer essentially measures voltage, and they have a formula for velocity depending on voltage. This formula is not derived from the definition of velocity but from an earlier measurement of... distance and time. The doppler effect which is used by GPS tracking systems mentioned in the other answer is based on a phase difference in the received GPS signals which is caused by a different distance to the satellites on different moments. So essentially this method uses distance and speed as well. The highway patrolmen mentioned in the comments measure time over a predetermined (short) distance. 

You just need some experience. After you have seen a lot, you will recognise others more easily. If your conversation partners don't know the terms, it's indeed better to explain them. It's most important to be absolutely clear - definitely more important than using the correct terms. Often, you don't even need to tell them they have committed a fallacy. With constructions like "So then you would also say that [something ridiculous]". 

All these proofs are a bit outdated and there are criticisms on them. Especially the proof of God (and thereby also the proof of the res extensa) isn't accepted. However, in his time that was probably all very clear. The real problem he had, was the Mind-body problem (how can mind and body interact if they're separated?). 

These two sentences simply state a (possible) interpretation of the two verses Hebrews 8:10 and John 4:26. 

In the beginning I said that to counter your argument, someone will have to claim that one or more of the premises is untrue. I'd say that premise 5, "Nothing imperfect can come from something that is perfect" is particularly debatable. The line of thought exposed there seems to assume that only the 'final product' (perfect/imperfect man) is what matters. Instead, consider for a moment that also the process to a final product matters: the process of development, possibly both physically and mentally, or even socially or more... In that case one could argue that the development process is perfect when it starts with imperfectness and finishes with perfectness. God would have created man in his imperfectness so that he can grow towards perfectness, making that process perfect. Note: these are not my personal ideas. 

We all intuitively know that Joe is right, but we don't know that formally. We are talking about formal logic here. Formally we just don't know, and, based merely on the fact we don't have either proof, we can't say anything about probabilities. Both arguments are equally unsound and weak. However, using other evidence (for example that nobody has ever seen a unicorn), we can say something about the probability of Alice's and Joe's conclusions: given the evidence that nobody has ever seen a unicorn, it is likelier that Joe is right than that Alice is right. This does not say anything about the weakness of their arguments though, only about the truth of their conclusions. 

Are crimes immoral per definition? I don't think so. A law is made to represent morality, but often fails and is rather a thin shadow of justice itself. Anyway, the question still stands. Is it moral to make someone sick or kill someone in order to reproduce myself? 

We make a case distinction over C. Suppose C is true. Then if (C &rightarrow; A) we know A, so the statement holds. Suppose C is false. Then, following the premise, (A &rightarrow; B) must be false (otherwise C would have been true). Now, recall the truth table of implication. (A &rightarrow; B) is false iff A is true(, but B not). Therefore, the statement holds for C is false as well. Since the statement holds for both C being true and C being false, the statement holds in any case. 

I will not give you the full answer as this looks like homework, but I will show you how to do it instead: You need to show that from P ∧ (P &rightarrow; Q) logically follows that Q - this is what the modus ponens says. Therefore, you need to prove (P ∧ (P &rightarrow; Q)) &rightarrow; Q is always true, that is, independently of P and Q. To do this, you can indeed use a truth table: 

If we're talking about a god who is not omniscient, that may change things, because the above argument doesn't hold anymore. Then it also gets rather unanswerable, because typical notions of god include omniscience - taking it out leaves little of the intuitive idea of a god, making it impossible to argue about it. 

No, this is not possible, because velocity is defined as distance divided by speed. In the SI system there are some non-derived base units, like time, distance, etc., but velocity is not one of these: 

Now as expressions you can take first (A &rightarrow; B), which is a part of your theorem. Then you take ¬ (A &rightarrow; B), which you can, because you know the truth table for (A &rightarrow; B) - you just wrote it down. Like this, you proceed, until you have the full expression in the rightmost column. If this column contains only 1, that means that the theorem is true for any values of A and B. Thus, the theorem would be proven. 

Is the author just being overly explicit in this last sentence, or should we from this conclude that "the facts being all the facts" is not a fact, and is not part of the world? 

You can't evaluate moral rules to true or false Religious rules like "do A, B, C, don't do X, Y, Z" belong to ethics, which questions whether something is right or wrong. You are looking at them from an epistemological point of view, which causes misunderstanding. The question for these rules isn't whether they're true, but whether they're good. So, you can't really "evaluate the statement to true" or false, especially not when the argument is that it has effect on your heart. Assuming we can't prove whether a God exists or not, the question arises what we should do with books like the bible or the Qur'an. Should we follow them, or should we leave them alone and don't bother about a possible life hereafter? To you, it seems clear that it's best to do A, B and C and don't do X, Y, and Z: it's such a little effort, why wouldn't you do it when it can cost you your life hereafter? That is a valid reasoning, but it doesn't say a thing about whether what you believe is true or not. Others might not want to be bounded to rules when they aren't sure about the profit they'll gain from it, which can be the base for non-believing. Also this is a valid reasoning, but this doesn't say a thing about the truth of belief either. There's something else with your reasoning... You say the quoted text has property #3, with this argument: 

You are right that if argument X uses circular reasoning, it is not a valid argument according to the common interpretation, and surely not very convincing. Most theologians therefore do not argue the Bible's correctness by the Bible's correctness. As an example, let's take Gerald O'Collins, who makes a case for the resurrection in his Rethinking Fundamental Theology (p. 155)*: 

A key point in the generally accepted notion of 'language' is communication. So you can't really say it doesn't matter if society around you speaks the same language or not. Imperative vs. informational The language family you used as an example, Assembly, is an imperative language: it gives instructions to a processor. It is not able to hold information, even in the very simple form of propositional logic. True, you may set or clear bits depending on the truth of a statement, but then the language still doesn't convey information: interpretation is needed. In natural languages, information is very important. Exchanging information is one of the main functions of language. Other programming languages like prolog or functional languages may be better suited to convey information, however, it is complicated to work with uncertainty in these languages (for example, "It may be raining"). Don't underestimate your ability to speak natural language You're saying you may as well put Assembly as your native language. Please consider for a moment writing your above question in Assembly. Then reconsider claiming Assembly could've been your mother tongue. 

Modern science does not make any part of philosophy redundant. Science builds on a certain set of assumptions and we need philosophy to understand that: take for example Hume who showed that the existence causality cannot be shown. In fact, modern science needs non-ethical disciplines from philosophy to continue. Popper is widely taught in science study programmes. So, I would say that science is a new discipline which needs philosophy, and that science and philosophy operate in different areas of the academical spectrum: they attempt to answer different questions. Where science tries to find knowledge, philosophy tries to find wisdom. The fields are relevant to each other: consider the philosophical question "What can we know?" There may of course be some overlap between science and philosophy. However, at least with the current state of science, ethics is not an area in which this overlap exists. With the current developments in areas as artificial intelligence, more and more people start to say, like you, that we should think about the direction where we are going. However, this is not something philosophy can solve. If philosophers think more about ethics, that is not necessarily going to change whether AI specialists work on speech recognition to help disabled people or on robot warfare. To solve that problem (if you are to call it a problem), study programmes in science should focus more on ethics. 

In other words, ask your partner to precisely define his notion of worthlessness, and then ask him to show that the work you're discussing is worthless in a way irrelevant of who wrote it (to avoid the ad hominem). 

Yes, in propositional logic you could use ¬ A ∧ ¬ B where A = 'no cats are black' and B = 'all cats are black', but that's hardly an improvement from C = 'some cats are black', which is an atomic sentence (can't be split up) as well. For things like this it's much easier to use first-order predicate logic and quantifiers: ∃c &in; C [B(c)], where C is the set of all cats and B(c) &iff; c is black. You can read this as 'there exists at least one element c in the set C of all cats for which B(c), that is, the cat being black, holds'. Abstract: ∃v&in;V [P(v)] &iff; there exists an (at least one) v in V such that P(v). Other quantifiers are ∃! (there exists exactly one ... such that ...) and ∀ (for all ... holds ...). 

But this argument isn't really sound. if people would follow God merely because what He's asking is good, then in fact they're not following Him, it's just that the behaviour is largely comparable with the case that they would follow Him. It's just a coincidence. The answer here therefore depends on your idea of loyalty. 

1: Why there? According to Descartes that is the only part of the body that does not exist as two identical halves and doesn't have an identical twin. For example, it can't be the eye, because you have two, and it can't be your nose, because it has two nostrils. 

Then of course we cannot formalise "If X is a man" with "For every element X of the set of human beings, if X is a man ...". This is because X is a free variable (i.e., not bound by a quantifier). If X isn't specified however, we should formalise the sentence with a universal quantifier in order to introduce X ourselves. D As said above, the equivalence of the above two statements follows from basic set theory. 

Another response is of course to claim that while we can't prove the Bible's correctness, we cannot falsify [some points from] it either, and that therefore we should rely on faith. That some argument claiming P isn't valid, doesn't mean P isn't true. 

In Cartesian dualism, there is contact between mind and body in the 'homunculus' (Latin for 'little man', but also the Latin name for the epiphysis), a little part of the brain1. The body sends information from the senses to the mind. The mind 'processes' those signals and returns commandos to the body. The mind can also do something without getting information from the senses, i.e. when it just thinks, and it can command the body in that case as well. In this image, you can see the body-part of a human: eyes give information to the epiphysis, the mind processes the information, and sends a command to the arm, which moves.
