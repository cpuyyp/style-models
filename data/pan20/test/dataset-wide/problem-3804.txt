The group $D$ is the preimage of $E$ in $N(F)$, so it is as you expect. The finiteness hypothesis can be weakened, which is important for many applications. Things become clearer if one thinks categorically in terms of the universal properties. Say an arbitrary group $G$ acts freely and properly discontinuously and isometrically on $X$ and $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Then $G/H$ acts freely and properly discontinuously and isometrically on $X/H$ with $X \rightarrow (X/H)(G/H)$ a $G$-invariant map. The induced map $f:X/G \rightarrow (X/H)(G/H)$ is an isomorphism. Indeed, both sides composed back with the natural map from $X$ satisfy the same universal property, and $f$ respects the maps from $X$, so $f$ is an isomorphism. QED In fact, with more work this can all be done more generally with $G$ and Lie group and $H$ a closed normal Lie subgroup, under suitable "niceness" hypotheses for the orbit maps (which are satisfied in the above situation): see Proposition 13 in section 1.6 of Chapter III of Bourbaki LIE. 

Indeed since the map on the base is not an isomorphism (apart from silly cases such as when $X$ is empty: the Frobenius endomporphism of a locally finite type $\mathbb{F}_p$-scheme is an isomorphism if and only if the scheme is etale), the pullback cannot be universal. Functorially, $F$ carries a family of closed subschemes of projective space to the family defined (locally over the base) by the equations with coefficients raised to the $p$-power. Concretely, a hypersurface with some coefficient of 1 and another not a $p$-power in the base ring does not occur in the pullback family. 

Yes. Inject $f_ {!}$ into $f_ {\ast}$ to convert it into a claim concerning equality among "base change morphisms" (not generally isomorphisms) relating topological pushforward and pullback. Then it is a matter of just looking at the definitions (and how pullback is built as a sheafification of a certain presheaf). 

I give an argument using the correct definition of isotriviality (relating it to the weak definition), and the reader who is familiar with Deligne-Mumford stacks can see that the method is actually applicable quite generally to separated Deligne-Mumford stacks locally of finite presentation over an algebraically closed field (these hypotheses ensure the existence of a coarse moduli space; perhaps it can all be done more generally). Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and $E \rightarrow S$ an elliptic curve over a reduced $k$-scheme $S$ such that $j:S \rightarrow \mathbb{A}^1_k$ is a constant map to some $j_0 \in k$. Let $E_0$ be an elliptic curve over $k$ with $j$-invariant $j_0$. We claim there is an etale cover $S' \rightarrow S$ such that $E_{S'} \simeq (E_0)_{S'} := (E_0) \times_{{\rm{Spec}}(k)} S'$. In other words, the weak notion of isotriviality implies the right notion when $S$ is reduced. This will proceed by "standard" EGA-style reduction steps (and the proof will show by conceptual reasons that the reducedness hypothesis on $S$ cannot be dropped when $j_0 = 0, 1728$). Consider the functor on $S$-schemes ${\rm{Isom}}(E,(E_0)_S)$ whose $T$-points are ${\rm{Isom}}_T(E_T, (E_0)_T)$ for an $S$-scheme $T$. This is represented by a finite type unramified $S$-scheme, and we just need to check that it is etale surjective over $S$ (so then we can take it to be $S'$, over which there is a "universal isomorphism"). We can assume $S$ is affine, then by limit arguments we can assume it is finite type over $k$, and then local (and essentially finite type over $k$) with residue field $k$ provided we prove the etale property for the Isom-scheme over the closed point. We can pass to the completion, so now the problem is rather concrete: if $R$ is a reduced complete local noetherian $k$-algebra with residue field $k$ and if $E$ is an elliptic curve over $R$ with special fiber $E_0$ such that $j(E) \in R$ is equal to $j_0 := j(E_0)$ then we claim that $E \simeq (E_0)_R$ (so the Isom-scheme of interest is the base change to $R$ of the Aut-scheme of $E_0$, so it is etale over $R$ as desired). Let $A$ denote the universal deformation ring of $E_0$, so $E$ corresponds to a local $k$-algebra map $A \rightarrow R$ which we want to show kills the maximal ideal of $A$. Since $R$ is reduced, it suffices to show that some power of the maximal ideal of $A$ dies in $R$. Let $G_0 = {\rm{Aut}}_k(E_0)$ be the finite automorphism group of $E_0$, so the completed local ring $O$ at $j_0$ on the coarse moduli space $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ is the ring $A^{G_0}$. (I am omitting the rigorous proof of the "well-known" fact that $\mathbb{A}^1_k$ is the coarse moduli space for the moduli stack of elliptic curves in a good sense which includes this description of the completed local ring at geometric points. If such a proof is unclear then someone can always post an MO query about it. This link with deformation rings is the heart of the argument, as will soon become clear.) The map $A^{G_0} \rightarrow A$ is finite and local (since $G_0$ is a finite group), so the maximal ideal of $A^{G_0}$ generates a max-primary ideal of $A$. By hypothesis $A^{G_0} \rightarrow R$ kills the maximal ideal, whence $A \rightarrow R$ kills a power of the maximal ideal. We have seen that this suffices for our needs (due to the reducedness of $R$). QED 

The reference is "Auslander-Buchsbaum formula". What matters is that $X$ and $Y$ are smooth of some common pure dimension $n$ (which forces flatness due to the quasi-finiteness, by the way), not that one has global affine spaces. Then every coherent sheaf on $X$ has stalks with finite projective dimension, and so all of projective dimension zero (= locally free) precisely when the depth of each stalk is equal to the dimension of its support on the local ring. A length-$n$ regular sequence at $p(x) \in Y$ exists by the local freeness on the base, and that's such a sequence at $x$ provided that the successive quotients arising in the definition of "regular sequence" really remain nonzero when localizing upstairs. The completion of the $p(x)$-stalk of the pushforward is the product of the completions at the points of $p^{-1}(p(x))$, so each factor module is free and hence we're OK as long as such factor modules are all nonzero since we can use a regular sequence in the completed local ring at $p(x)$. So we have to rule out the possibility of a vanishing completed stalk, or equivalently a vanishing stalk, upstairs. In such cases, upon passing to connected=irreducible components, the coherent sheaf $F$ would vanish on a Zariski-dense open upstairs, and hence on some $p^{-1}(U)$ for a dense open $U$ in the base. Then $p_ {\ast}(F)$ would vanish on $U$ and hence vanish by local freeness, so $F = 0$. The case $F = 0$ is easy to handle directly. 

Etale cohomology, whose definition and study would be inconceivable without the use of categorical methods, underlies the construction of many interesting Galois representations as well as the entire context for Deligne's work on the Riemann Hypothesis for varieties over finite fields and its various generalizations, and work of Taylor et al. on Sato-Tate. The concept of moduli schemes and the study of their non-trivial properties (and reasons for their existence) would likewise be impossible without the systematic use of categorical reasoning, and these underlie Faltings' work on the Mordell conjecture, the work of Drinfeld/Lafforgue on global Langlands correspondence for function fields, the work of Wiles et al. on modularity of Galois representations, the work of Mazur/Merel on torsion in elliptic curves over number fields, the use of Heegner points by Gross-Zagier...and the role of Galois cohomology in all of these matters (informed through homological reasoning) is utterly pervasive. There's so much more which could be said, but I think the above is quite sufficient to make it clear that categorical and homological methods are ubiquitous throughout the deepest parts of modern algebraic number theory. 

To be honest, I have never in my life paid any attention to this stuff (except for its sieving application when reading postdoc job applications). I read papers because of the title/abstract, or knowing what the content is about. I pick a couple when forced to by journals, and didn't think anyone actually cares. It's like the "Keyword" stuff I am forced to create (which again I never look at for papers I read). Are those actually used for something? I agree that for NSF logistics and job applications it is useful. But the question is focused on its role in research papers, and that is where I don't get it, and is what my puzzlement is about. I never look for papers in my areas of interest by searching for MSC numbers, and I never look for papers by searching for a "Keyword". I am really baffled by the tradition of putting these things in research papers. 

Serre introduced a notion of "thin set" in the $k$-rational points of a $k$-variety (such as $k^n$ viewed as the $k$-rational points of affine $n$-space, or likewise for a Zariski-dense open locus in affine $n$-space over $k$, depending on denominators in the coefficients of $f$ in your motivating example) as a mild generalization of "nowhere Zariski-dense" precisely to quantify issues related to Hilbert irreducibility, exactly as in your question. So the answer to your question is the concept of thin sets in the $k$-rational points of $k$-varieties (with $k$ an infinite field). See the Wikipedia entry on "thin set" for more specific information and references to the literature. 

It all works out as well as you could want in every possible sense because of the freeness of the action. As you know, you can make a cover by $G$-stable affine opens, so the real work is in that case. So we focus on the affine case, and then all hypotheses on the affine can be removed: let $A$ be any ring whatsoever and $G$ a finite group acting freely on $X = $ Spec($A$) in the sense of acting freely on the set of geometric points valued in any algebraically closed field, which forces the strongest sense of acting freely on points valued in any ring at all. Thus, $G \times X := \coprod_{g \in G} X \rightarrow X \times X$ as functors via $(g,x) \mapsto (x, g.x)$ is a subfunctor inclusion and thus an equivalence relation on $X$ in the sense of functors. Now for the real content: that equivalence relation condition, coupled with $G \times X \rightrightarrows X$ being finite locally free (even finite etale) implies that SGA3, Expose V, 4.1(iv) applies, so $X := {\rm{Spec}}(A)$ is a finite etale cover of $Y := {\rm{Spec}}(A^G)$ and the natural map $$\coprod_ {g \in G} X \rightarrow X \times_ Y X$$ via $x_g \mapsto (x, g.x)$ on the $g$th copy of $X$ is an isomorphism. This is a deep result of Grothendieck in such generality. In particular, if $A^G$ is a $B$-algebra and $B \rightarrow B'$ is any map of rings then the natural map $$B' \otimes_B A^G \rightarrow (B' \otimes_B A)^G$$ is an isomorphism. So the $G$-invariant map $\pi:X \rightarrow Y$ is a $G$-torsor for the etale topology and hence $Y$ is a quotient of $X$ by the $G$-action in all good senses (quotient sheaf, good behavior under base change, universal mapping property, etc.). In particular, by etale descent theory (see the example of "Galois covers" in section 6.2 or so of the book "Neron Models") it follows that $\pi_{\ast}^G$ and $\pi^{\ast}$ induce inverse equivalence between the category of quasi-coherent $O_Y$-modules and $G$-equivariant quasi-coherent $O_X$-modules. In particular, for $G$-equivariant quasi-coherent $O_X$-modules $F$, the formation of $\pi_{\ast}(F)$ and $\pi_{\ast}(F)^G$ commute with any base change on the quotient (e.g., passing to a fiber there). Hence, the geometric fibers of $\pi_{\ast}(F)$ are the $G$-invariants on the fibers, as you desired, and more vividly the fiber of $\pi_{\ast}(F)$ at a geometric point $y$ of $Y$ is the direct sum of the fibers at the points in the $G$-orbit fiber of geometric points on $X$ over $y$, with $G$ acting simply transitively on this collection of fibers at points of $X_y$. Edit: As t3suji points out, the situation is much simpler (without needing freeness conditions) if $|G|$ is a unit on the schemes in question. 

Here are some remarks on the answers of Charles Matthews, Kevin Buzzard, and Victor Protsak. For justification of Kevin Buzzard's claim, see G. Prasad, "An elementary proof of a theorem of Bruhat-Tits-Rousseau and of a theorem of Tits" from Bull. Soc. Math. France 110 (1982), pp. 197--202, for an incredibly elegant and short proof that over any henselian valued field $F$, a connected reductive $F$-group $G$ is $F$-anisotropic if and only if $G(F)$ is "bounded" (a property defined in terms of a choice of closed immersion of $G$ into an affine space over $F$, the choice of which doesn't matter; this is meaningful for any affine $F$-scheme of finite type and equivalent to compactness when $F$ is locally compact). Platanov-Rapinchuk has a universal assumption that all fields of characteristic 0 (except when they're finite), so unfortunately that reference is insufficient for uniform arguments over all non-archimedean local fields. I suppose (near?-)circularity (suggested by Victor Protsak) is a more serious issue. :) There remains the matter of determining, for locally compact non-archimedean $F$ and connected reductive $F$-groups, precisely when the $F$-anisotropic case can actually occur. As Victor Protsak mentioned, via Bruhat-Tits theory one sees that for connected semisimple $F$-groups which are absolutely simple and simply connected over a non-archimedean local field $F$ (i.e., $G$ a simply connected $F$-form of a Chevalley group), such forms never exist away from type A, and in type A the $F$-anisotropic examples are precisely the $F$-groups of norm-1 units of central simple algebras over $F$. (Note the contrast with the case $F = \mathbb{R}$, for which there's always a "compact form" of any Chevalley type.) Let me now briefly explain why this handles the general connected reductive case, by a standard kind of argument with central isogenies and separable Weil restriction. (This is explained also in the article [2] of Tits referenced in Charles Matthews' answer.) If $f:G' \rightarrow G$ is a (possibly inseparable) central $F$-isogeny between connected reductive $F$-groups then the preimage of an $F$-torus of $G$ is an $F$-torus of $G'$ (since maximal tori in $G'$ are their own functorial centralizers, so $\ker f$ is of multiplicative type, nothing funny happens when $f$ is not separable). Since $F$-anisotropcity of an $F$-torus is invariant under $F$-isogenies (as we see using the $F$-rational character group, or more direct arguments), it follows that $G$ is $F$-anisotropic if and only if $G'$ is. (This argument has the advantage of working over any field $F$, in contrast with a direct attack on the topology of rational points by using finiteness theorems for Galois cohomology of connected reductive groups.) Thus, by considering an arbitrary connected reductive $F$-group $G$ and letting $G'$ denote the product of its maximal central $F$-torus and the simply connected central cover of the derived group $D(G)$, we see that the problem comes down to the simply connected case. But in the simply connected semisimple case, the general structure of connected semisimple groups over fields (in terms of central isogenous quotient of direct product of commuting simple "factors") implies that $G$ is uniquely a direct product of commuting $F$-simple connected semisimple $F$-groups, each of which is simply connected, so we may assume $G$ is $F$-simple. Then by an elementary result of Borel and Tits (6.21 in "Groupes reductif", IHES), $G = {\rm{Res}}_ {F'/F}(G')$ for a finite separable extension $F'/F$ and a connected semisimple $F'$-group $G'$ that is absolutely simple and simply connected. By the good behavior of Weil restriction with respect to the formation of the topological group of rational points, it follows that the equality ${\rm{Res}}_ {F'/F}(G')(F) = G'(F')$ of abstract groups is a homeomorphism, so we can replace $(G,F)$ with $(G',F')$ to reduce to the case when $G$ is also absolutely simple, the case addressed by Victor Protsak above. (A more algebraic argument with Galois descent relating maximal $F'$-tori in $G'$ and maximal $F$-tori in its Weil restriction to $F$ shows the equivalence of anisotropicity for $G'$ and its Weil restriction through the finite separable $F'/F$, where $F$ can be taken to be any field at all.) Conclusion: for non-archimedean local $F$, the $F$-anisotropic connected reductive $F$-groups are precisely the central quotients of products of an $F$-anisotropic torus and groups of norm-1 units of central division algebras over finite separable extensions of $F$.
