For bhikkhus, Some vegetables are not allowable. Better to do juice and mix with cool water. The BMC says boiled juices are sugar. This is only Thai Tradition. BMC will list the vegetables and fruits allowable. Cucumber is not allowable. Boiled juices are prohibited by paauk Tea is actually not allowable as a "drink" for this reason of heating. Leaf juice is allowable, but you cannot add boiling water. Hence the rule of only warming by the sun's heat. You should be "sick and have a reason" for any medicine. This would outlaw, cold green tea. Aka Snapple. Juice drinks or sugar mixed with water can be taken for any reason, including thirst. 

BMC I, 2009 ed. pdf Monks must also practice right livelihood according to not doing things from the list below: 

I see the original question as been modified when I went online again. The original question included "hinting/asking" I have included this under wrong livelihood. Monks need to follow all of the rules 227 rules and also the rules in the Culavagga and Mahavagga. Likewise, they need to follow according to the commentaries as well in most cases. Most Western Bhikkhus do not like the commentaries. That is where "interpretations" can come. Most of the information below, is from the BMC The Buddhist Monastic Code Summary: A Bhikkhu cannot use money. A Bhikkhu cannot point out a kappiya without someone asking, "Who is you kappiya?" A Bhikkhu cannot accept envelopes presumably with money inside. It is an asannya offence (in the root text). Which means, no perception is necessary for it to be unallowable. That means the monks should not be intentionally ignorant. The BMC debates and allows the modern use of "checks." A Bhikkhu cannot ask for things from "Just anyone". He needs an invitation from a non-family member ( blood relation) A Bhikkhu cannot hint to "Just anyone" (as above) A Bhikkhu cannot do the above for another bhikkhu(s) either. The BMC says checks are not money but a "promise to pay." Sri Lanka and Myanmar Vinaya traditions call this money. Money is defined as anything accepted as used in trade. A US dollar is a mere bank note too. Google "A Life Free From Money pdf" The same as above is judged with signing checks. A bhikkhu can ask for a bowl from anyone if it is broken or stolen. A bhikkhu can ask for a single robe from anyone if he is left with only one (of three). A bhikkhu can go for alms in the evening for "extra items," usually medicine or oil for light. The donors will offer food and he will refuse. Then the person may ask, "what do you need?" Then he can say. Lay people or committees can ask "just anyone" for things or money, etc. for monks if it is their own idea. This might be what you are seeing on brochures and websites, etc. A Bhikkhu cannot ask his helper, committee etc, to ask others for money for himself. A bhikkhu must be invited by a committee or kappiya before he asks them for things. The above list is followed correctly unfortunately by a small minority of monks, known as vinaya monks, or forest monks. Often the other (majority) monks do not know what proper behavior is. They may memorize the rules, but do not think it is something to be practiced since corruption is so wide spread. One of my monastic friends told me he cried when he found out that he was never supposed to touch money. A monk may purify himself at any time. Often, they just do not know. Traditions often have interpretations which makes items seem "allowable.". Sometimes this is allowed and sometimes one can just be fooling oneself. In the end it is up to them. Often bhikkhus do not reflect or question questionable practices in a tradition because of the wide spread use. Money and medicines are often such topics. 

Isn't the question really asking is science and Buddhism compatible or are they like oil and water, never finding common ground? Buddhism teaches that all sentient beings can eventually be free. This process called evolution has led to self-conscious beings with the potential to evolve and awaken into what Buddhists call awakened consciousness. What science also says is that 4% of the universe is visible. And 96% is dark matter or energy that is not visible and is unknowable with the mind. The problem is that science is a theoretical field and Buddhism has many certainties in its teachings. However some branches of Buddhism introduce the concept of uncertainty. This very much corresponds to the 96% unseen part of the universe. So if we use the intellect we are only capable of describing the visible universe. Buddhism seems to imply that the seen is not the power of the universe, but the unknown is the source of uncertainty and power. Getting back to evolution, it describes the visual universe. Buddhism does not deny evolution as the Dalai Lama tries to reconcile religion and Buddhism, but Buddhism goes far beyond the theory of evolution because it infers the existence of awareness not subject to the laws of form. Science and Buddhism look at existence and non-existence with different lens, but one does not exclude the other. 

According to the Fifth Method of Dependent Origination, there are five causes and five results. The five results are the five khandas. The five causes are ignorance, craving, clinging, formations, kamma force. This is listed in the Vissudhimagga. Path Of Purification (2011 PDF, p601) These are broken up into two consciousness wholesome and unwholesome for humans who are lucky to have a wholesome factor in their near death moment of the immediate past life. Humans always have wholesome kamma force and sankhara (formations) The unwholesome is the craving consciousness. It includes the ignorance mental factor which is part of craving. Clinging is repeated craving. So all three are nearly the same type of unwholesome mind. Got that? Wholesome with unwholesome do not mix together, but the unwholesome mind can "surround" the wholesome mind. So when you did something good in a past life, like something of generosity, you wished to do something (that requires a body) or you wished to become someone (ignorantly). So someone who is male previously wished for becoming male. Someone who is female previously wished to be female. Whether or not one has enough kamma to get that wish is another story. It is like a raffle ticket. Buy more raffle tickets and you have better odds. Do something once that is really big and many raffle tickets get put into the pot. Habitual kamma is a good way to get that wish. Heavy kamma like what Bill Gates did, will also help. (His is both because of his continued involvement, but he may wish other things). Bill Gates probably did something similar in a past life and kept wishing to help other people (to do that with a male body). Then the opportunities (supporting kamma) from other kammas helped support that wish. Read "Outliers" and you will see it was not chance for him to become so rich. Often people switch sexes and species, but I imagine that most people wish with the same sex perception because they do not imagine otherwise. I suspect most sex changes happen via the animal realm. For instance, a dog may want the conditions to have food and whoever feeds him may be the gender resultant next life gender. There are of course humans who wish for sex changes and even do so even in their current life too! So it does happen as humans for future births as well. There is a wheel publication by Venerable Nyantiloka called "Fundamental Themes". It is not easy to read, but it is correct. "The Workings of Kamma" by Venerable Pa-Auk Sayadaw explains this too. There is a chapter on kamma in Ven. Narada's book.. "The Buddha and His Teachings". I think a pamphlet was made from that chapter too. This is a great book for newbies. You might be able to find a meditation manual on dependent origination by Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadaw. It is called "The Fifth Method". It is not readable for the average person. However the first section might be interesting. It is posted it to my website..unlisted. The rest should be easy to find for free. 

I have never seen a zombie. Is this an invention of human fear? If I told you that I have dreams about flying cows, would flying cows have a Buddha nature? What keeps us from seeing Buddha nature is the concept of self that we entertain in our hearts and mind. If the cup is empty, it can be filled. If the cup is full of muddy water, you can put nothing in it till you empty out the muddy water and wash the glass. A koan in Zen is "Does a dog have Buddha nature?" Some masters say yes and some say no. It is unanswerable unless one uses it as a koan. More on this here. $URL$ 

It seems that one can enter the Bodhisattva way more easily than trying to attain the bhumis. Too much can be made of attaining, while not enough of serving others. I find the Dalai Lama's Book THE OPEN HEART to be a wonderful introduction to the Bodhisattva way. It is a book not only of words but pointing to action to free all sentient beings. If you want more info on bhumis you will find it in this article that even describes the bhumis as "hyperbolic". Perhaps that is a hint that we should stick more to basics and keep things simple. The Buddha gave us an example of a simple life. Some of those that followed tried to make it more complicated than it was. Remember the Flower Sermon. The Buddha holds up a flower and smiles. That is the whole sermon. $URL$ 

"Medicines" There are some things in the BMC which I think are very misleading, especially concerning, "medicines" and how "Any Reason" is defined (p232). I could not find any pƒÅli evidence that mentions "hunger and fatigue" as a valid medical reason. I could be wrong, but I asked a couple of knowledgeable monks to verify this and they also agreed with my findings. This would exclude many things which are considered medicines. I will not cover further with lists of the "medicines." Only that there should be a valid reason for taking them and justifying their use after Noon. The reflection and criteria are below. It is in every monastery chanting book and should be chanted every day. (Nauyana chanting book source) "Medicine Reflection" 

If they support you then it is OK. You should ask for support according to their faith and ability. Normally supporters and family are the same words in pali. It is listed in the Metta sutta as family "kulesu", often translated as donors. However, one should live a modest life and ask for only what one needs. Asking for sangha needs is much better. It depends on your family's desire. There could be a problem with receiving donations from your parents if you gave them money beforehand. I am not sure of the exact details. While I do not know the exact rule for this, I do remember asking about this with a monk who gave his parents money and then asked for a computer specifically saying, "Use the money I gave you.". The teacher (Sayadaw U Kovida, paauk) said this would be unallowable. (This transaction never went through, by the way) To avoid a situation like this, if you do give your parents your money, you should say, "This is yours, use as you wish." Or "Do not use this for me or to monks." Then when you ask them for things, whatever they do, it is their money and donations are from their own doings. It is actually legal for them or even a bank to have money for you as long as you do not use it. This is how one ordains temporary in a vinaya tradition. If you decide to stay full time, things can get complicated with bank accounts (if you are one who cares about vinaya). Some need to temporarily disrobe to handle their affairs. According to ratapala sutta, he told his parents to throw the money in the river. 

Dogen tried to demystify the practice of meditation and put things in an experiential reference point. One must choose a path that is inclined to the ways that are your own inner orientation. Both of these examples offer evidence of the Buddha and Dogen being free of being firebrand preaching in favor of sticking to the plain, essentials of the path. This question remains open to various interpretation as long as no reliable sources exist directly from the time of Buddha. However, Dogen's life is well documented and may give us clues to the Buddha's style and intensity. 

In searching for choosing inhospitable or uncomfortable environments, I discovered many practices that, at least for beginners, involve choosing a safe comfortable environment. $URL$ Here people are practicing in a natural environment that may not be a monastery: 

My own approach toward pain is to meditate. If I have pain sitting up I lay down. If I fall asleep I must need sleep. What is meditation? "a state of consciousness in which the observer detaches from several qualities of the mind." One of these qualities is pain. $URL$ 

I like the neutral tone of the ideas by "the hermit". We are in this world and we can use technology as we are doing now to awaken ourselves to our real nature or we can use it to increase our sense of personal self. What seems apparent is that we cannot make someone practice that feels in their bones the calling to live out their personal sense of life. Nor can we, or would we want to, tear a bikhu from the practice of awakening to the Buddha nature. Technology is a tool. We can use it to enhance our understanding and practice, or we can use it to crystallize our self-conceptions and self-deceptions. What we cannot change is the inner drive a person feels to reach their destiny in whatever form that is, be it worldly or spiritual. If they feel the spiritual fire nothing will stand in their way. Let us not demonize technology or idealize Buddhism. Is this not what having compassion for all is about, acceptance without judgement?
