To be honest, at first I was upset with your question. I mean, every child in Poland is taught that Christopher Columbus discovered America. How would it be possible if America would be precisely synonymous with United States, as it was written by you. Also my Brasilian friend Rodrigo, who stays at my place for few days, asked me to write it here that he defines himself as an American. But indeed, I cannot deny that there are plenties of situations where people use words such as America or American speaking particularly about United States and Polish language dictionaries mention it as one of common use of those words or even the main one. I've started to check it by myself. There's no mention of Americans in Declaration of Independence nor the Constitution. But I've found it in few first inaugural speeches of US Presidents. 1st inaugural speech by George Washington 

This way first, European (Christian) international trade wasn't well developed until 11th century, mainly due to the fall of ancient culture. It took European civilization a lot of time to get up after that. But there were some smart merchants who made a fine business by initiating contacts between both worlds. They were, of course, Jews. 

As my favorite ice hockey team became the champion of Poland today, I reminded famous Battle of the Ice that took place in 1242. During the fights, forces of Alexander Nevsky managed to draw Teutonic Knights at the frozen lake Peipus, where they started to slip and in consequence, many of them drowned under the ice. The question is, where there any other battles in history, in which the ice took such an important role? I don't mean the usual influence of winter conditions like during Napoleon campaign or Eastern Front during World War II, but the particular case of a battle taking place on the frozen river, lake or sea. Both land and navy battles counts. 

My knowledge about the topic is rather narrow, but I know about at least of one such situation. So called "Gypsy revolt" happened in Gypsy Family Camp in Auschwitz II-Birkenau. It's known as the unique act of resistance inside of the camp. Official website of the Museum writes about it in the following words: 

In February of 1942, the mentioned Executive Order 9066 was signed. Month later certain groups of enemy aliens were excluded from that order. The list of them contained such conditions as e.g. old age, poor health or close family members of US Army soldiers. It was clearly stated that all those exclusions could apply only to aliens of German or Italian origins, not to Japanese, except for the poor health condition (deaf, blind or hospital residents). Around the same time Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War, stated that Italians are "potentially less dangerous, as a whole, than those of other enemy nationalities" and that "the size of Italian population and the number of troops and facilities which would have to be employed to deal with them, their inclusion in the general plan would greatly overtax our strength". Similar conclusions were brought up by House Select Committee investigating the evacuation of enemy aliens. The linked material is the full text of Comitee hearings with many paragraphs speaking of Germans and Italians situation. From the reasons mentioned above it stated that "Indeed, this committee is prepared to say that any such proposal is out of the question if we intend to win this war". From this reasons it was decided by General Hugh A. Drum, commanding general of the Eastern Defense Command, that "Mass evacuation is not contemplated. Instead thereof, such evacuations as may be considered necessary will be by selective processes applicable to enemy aliens, or to other persons deemed dangerous to remain at large within the area or within its zones". General John L. DeWitt, commanding general of the Western Defense Command, disagreed with that, finding the mass evacuation a "military necessity". He demanded "definite instructions to the contrary that would exempt him from all responsibility for the consequences". On May 15, 1942, he was informed that there was to be no "collective evacuation of German and Italian aliens from the West coast or from anywhere else in the United States", but that the War Department will authorize individual exclusion orders "against both aliens and citizens under the authority of Executive Order 9066". As for Italians, in November 1942 it was announced that they were no longer considered "aliens of enemy nationality". Jacobs provides the following map of interment camps for German-Americans. 

Yes, there was such a bill, known as Indiana Pi Bill, but it was never approved by the State. You can find a very interesting article on the matter, written by Arthur E. Hallerburg, in the text of Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science. Search for the phrase House Bill No. 246 Revisited. The whole affair started in 1894, when American Mathematical Monthly released an article "Quadrature of the circle" by Edward J. Goodwin in number 1(7): 246â€“248. Then it was introduced to the Indiana House of Representatives by Representative Taylor I. Record, under the following title: 

Polish language version of the post is a bit more detailed. We can read there that according to the memories of Tadeusz Joachimowski, Polish prisoner who was a writer in the Gypsy Camp, a day before Georg Bonigut came to him and told about the upcoming extermination. He also told him to warn the Gypsies and order them "not to go to the slaughter like rams", but to gather all possible weapon (spades, crowbars, rocks, even knives), stay in the barracks and fight. 

During Partitions of Poland, Zbaraz was a part of Austro-Hungarian Empire and there weren't good railway connections between Galician towns and those at Russian side, also because of different breadth of rails. This way I believe your grandmother could use the railway connection between Tarnopol and Krakow, which was part of Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis. And from there she could take another train going through Kielce to Warsaw, as from what I know, that was the easiest way. You can see the possible route on the linked map, which shows the state of connections in 1897. Here's its smaller version: 

This way, your man is called Balthasar Brandmayer. But it turns out that he's not just "some random soldier sitting next to Hitler" as we could think. In fact, he's an author of a book called "Two messengers" which was released in 1932. It speaks about the times of his war service and frequently refers to Hitler. I don't know if it was translated into English, but... I recommend you the linked book "Corporal Hitler and the Great War 1914-1918, The List Regiment" by John F. Williams, as there's a lot about Brandmayer, with quotes from his memoirs. Unfortunately many important pages are not included in the online preview, but there's still a lot to read about him. Below there's another photo from the same session, with Brandmayer lying at the grass.
