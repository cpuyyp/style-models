There is a FAR GRAVER concern here: Traveling to the future or the past can have severe impacts primarily because of conjugation and other similar processes. Simple quarantine is moronic and primitive potentially resulting in HUGE repercussions. Quarantining for space missions and epidemics are effective because their mission is simply to prove the absence of their existence. That the immune system has done its job and no harmful pathogens exist. Time Travel is a whole different beast when you consider pharmacological and bacteriological history. Today, both good and bad bacteria are evolving resistance to antibiotics. Bacteria through processes like conjugation can pass traits like antibiotic resistance to completely different bacteria. Why is this a HUGE threat to time travel? If your time traveler contained antibiotic resistant good bacteria, there is no amount of quarantine that can be performed to eliminate it. If they go back to the 1920s and spread their bacteria they could potentially destroy the onset/proliferation of penicillin which would have huge historical ramifications including a major set back to medical technological advancement. If you go forward in time you run the inverse which is bring back a bug that contains resistance to all modern and future drugs resulting in an equivalent blow to technological advancement. Make no mistake, we are currently in a endless arms race against the microbial world and the microbial world advances with every act of ignorance with this being the potential equivalent of giving the Egyptians Google. The only way I can see avoiding walking around in a full fledged hazmat suit is if you had a nanomachine enhanced immune system that can identify and eliminate all undesirable microbes. 

this isn't that different from many castle design layouts through Europe, middle East, and even asia. In that sense sure it would Is it particularly more effective than other layouts and or unbeatable then no it isn't. open castles like these not in difficult terrain were usually surrounded with large armies and eventually taken. the river system reminds me a lot of medieval Paris which was sacked a few times 

does not represent the amount of neutrinos received by Earth but is the amount of Neutrinos emitted by the source spherically outwards. Thus the first largest factor is the distance between the source and the detector. As this limits the total possible neutrinos a detector can receive. The next obvious factor is the cross section surface area of the detector with respect to the emission source. As this also impacts how many neutrinos can possibly be collected. Now the way most these detectors work is by the simple fact that IF a neutrino collides with a hydrogen atom it releases an electron which can be sensed with a sensor. This is why most neutrino arrays are surrounded by water containing electron sensing sensors. Even then this is dependent on the energy of the neutrino with low energy neutrinos being harder to detect with plenty passing through the Earth every day. So the question of: 

Aside from conventional means of killing something from a distance, the added vulnerability of flight generally increases the amount of potentially lethal options as it is usually easier to disable a flying thing than out right killing it (especially since impact can often finish the job). Another possible solution is conditioning Mine their territory with floating balloons that when destroyed some how damage or kill the attacker (be it an explosion or some kind of kinetic trap like a net that ensnares them causing them to plummet to the ground with the wreckage). Eventually the species will learn not to be aggressive towards passive human crafts passing through their terrain. Any animal only attacks as a means of defense, securing a mate, or acquiring food. Territorial instincts are a derivative of that. If you make it so human crafts offer none of those when killed but also add the risk of injury or death then most species learn to avoid you. It's similar to how porcupines defenses work on a psychological level. We recently have been employing this same tactic against lions. 

NOOO, There is no point in exporting "goods" to the planet, it's incredibly expensive. The real value in making things in space is so you dont have to spend the energy getting it there. So a space station near an asteroid belt that could make more space crafts would be invaluable. Anything you could make in space you could more easily make on a planet. With exception to certain technological research. But fundamentally, the sole value of making anything in space is to reduce the extremely high importation cost of bringing in that thing. EDIT- An off the deep end answer: It can be an interstellar space port which would effectively act as customs between planets and stars. Thus the goods that would be passed to the planet from the station would be foreign trade goods (exotic species in particular) that could not be made there. 

If by development you mean from birth, then not much difference. Sure he would have faster reaction speeds but he would still learn how to communicate based on his environment. Since we all communicate essentially the same he would have to learn to do so as well. Babies are great at this. It's a lot like this: how do you know I perceive blue the same way you perceive blue(same shade)? We both know its blue because we learned to call that color blue but that doesn't mean you see it the same way I do. This difference in perspective doesn't really impact our understanding because that understanding is agreed upon communally and accepted by us at some point as a fact. If you mean more like some adult suddenly woke up like that then yes there would be significant challenges. They would have to relearn how to communicate. They would have to relearn fine motor control. It would have similar symptoms as the after effects of a stroke except for higher memory loss. PS this is all under the assumption that mind is working 3X faster. Note: There is some biological precedence for this in humans. When we are encountered with a dire situation our bodies can trigger an adrenal response. When this happens; time can appear to move slowly, this is because our brains have kicked into high gear diverting focus to the processing of stimuli. Our reaction time increases as well. There is a lot more to this then just the change in perception of time. here's a starting point 

Depressor: Scientists announce a world destroying meteorite will collide with Earth in 1 year and the human race will be annihilated. Reverser: Governments announce they have destroyed the meteor 

Thermonuclear warheads do this unlike old atomic bombs hydrogen bombs produce more thermal energy than radiation. orbital launch is a non issue 

Answer #1: Play with these variable driving some to extremes to generate your desired seasonal system. Recently, a planetoid was discovered with winds so strong that its tidally locked solar generated hot spot was actually shifted from its face. So nothing is unreasonable when playing with these. Answer #2 - My favorite answer: Your own personal Night king to drive the world's seasons for you. 

There is no such thing, yet to even make something like this would require there to be some way to format/organize this. As far as I know Ive never heard of a standardized structure to world building and if there is it must be annoyingly complicated and overly rigid. Thus at this point you gotta use some kind of generic collaborative document generation tool.......like google docs. Great thing about google docs is it has version history so if someone flips the table on your project you can just revert their changes. 

There is none, robots are more effective at scientific data collection down there than humans so there is no value at sending humans. The premise of this plot is flawed conceptually. 30 days is way to short to acclimate to the pressure differences. Deep sea divers on oil rigs spend months in pressure chambers before and after their operational stint. It is also extremely risky where an accident can result in fatality or long term injury. Sending scientists is infeasible when scientists are better used analyzing data instead of doing dangerous hands on work. What would more likely be the case is you have a dozen technicians sent down there to maintain equipment and do detail work machines cant yet do. However, at these pressures the human body cannot be acclimated to survive without an external vehicle (like a futuristic mech dive suit). 

in this case, since local fauna is small and limited, if D cannot eat V then V will prevail as it is smaller allowing it to need less food and survive off smaller food sources. If D can eat V then they system would eventually reach a balance with D as an apex predator. This would likely follow the progression between dire wolves and gray wolves. Note: if this is a comparative question asking which species would essentially thrive better in the environment without the other present. I would say the answer is negligible as you are essentially releasing apex predators into a new ecosystem. The only factor that would determine its success is its ability to control its population (like wolves) and not over predate its ecosystem. There isn't enough data about these creatures to answer this perspective. 

Since its not technically over coastal waters technically it has no or virtually no effect. Algae wouldn't be able to thrive in that spot but at the same time that doesn't matter because algae have the whole ocean to live in. If the saucer were closer to coastal waters it would kill off corals but that is limited to such a tiny area that it is negligible to mans ability to kill off marine life. 

As you can tell, the skeletal structure of bats wings and birds wings is quite similar with 3 bones following roughly the same pattern, of course with differences in length. The real difference here comes down to the composition of the rest of the wing. Bats have fingers supporting a skin like carapace which provides enough surface area for lift. Birds on the other hand have feathers. Each feather has a support column much like the finger in the bat wing. Because the bird has more of these individual support structures it has greater control over the shape of its wing. That isn't to say a bat has no control over its shape, it just doesn't anatomically have near the capacity as a bird. Also note: im talking about the pronunciation of the wings apparent change in shape not their capability in flight. 

google docs is a google product, just about one of the few companies with a significant track record on ease of use. 

NO This is Madness I'm going to simplify your fundamental problem. A colony is like any other human communal or organizational structure: IT NEEDS UNIQUENESS AND INDIVIDUALITY Throughout history whenever man has attempted to homogenize a society it has resulted in failure. Forcing everyone to be this or think that inevitably gets crushed by the "out of the box" thinker that turns the table. In this case your collective of autists would be hammered by a normally composited society of socialites and autists. Normally I would try and explain my point further listing facts however you have now broached the incredibly enormous topic of what makes a society as well as human social patterns. There are plenty of text books, courses, and thesis you can read to enhance your understanding on this subject. Suffice it to say, what happens when your incredibly focused autist astronaut encounters a problem outside his comfort zone. Autists are generally not known for their adaptability. No one wants their nuclear core technician rocking back and forwards against a wall while the siren are blaring.
