Principle of Excluded Middle: "A proposition p and its negation ~p cannot be false together." Principle of Non-Contradiction: "A proposition p and its negation ~p cannot be true together. Principle of Bi-Valence: "A proposition is either true or false." PEM and PNC forbid a proposition and its negation having the same truth value. PB forbids a proposition being both true and false or neither true nor false. 

This question appears to be somewhat based on the premise that the source of morality is the whim of the majority. But, it is not the case that the source of morality is the whim of the majority. The source of morality is man's nature as a rational being. Thinking is your means of survival. Use it. 

Different representations of reality are no more or less objective for there are always invariants. In the physical sciences, we see this clearly. For example, in the Special Theory of Relativity, elapsed time and distance are relative to the observer's frame of reference. However, the proper time and proper distance are objective, they are the same for all inertial observers. The fact that the "human perspective" might be a different representation of reality from the representation of some hypothetical other rational being does not make these representations less objective. The goal of philosophy and the philosopher is (should be) to find the invariants of reality. 

Within Existence where, by Existence, I mean the totality of all that is, was, and will be. ... It is, I'm afraid, easy to ask questions that reveal a misconception of the terms used. One such question is "Where is the Universe?" Why not also ask "When is the Universe?" The point is that notions of "where" and "when" genetically depend on the concept of Universe which refers to all there is. To ask where or when is the Universe is to attempt to relieve those notions of the context on which they crucially depend. But, you can't do that. Those notions don't stand alone without any other context. 

Is there anything like a satire or serious response to Alvin Plantinga's Warranted Christian Belief for Naturalism / atheism / agnosticism..... something along the flavor of the title? 

In my basic logic course if I want to prove A ⊃ B then I would do the following: 1 Show A ⊃ B 2 A Assumption for Conditional derivation. 3 Stuff..... 4 Show B 5 More stuff.... 6 B [or some contradiction] Then because B [ or some contradiction] appeared in line 6 then this closes a box around lines 5 and 6, then I can cross out the word "Show" in line 4 and I get to now use B in the general part of my proof. But because B is now available then I have proven A ⊃ B and can box lines 2 through 6 and cross out "Show" on line 1. 

Both the affirmation of the AC and its denial are consistent in set theory, but is there in any way that one can say it must be the case that one of them is actually true? I understand what it means for AC and its denial to be consistent; but is there a sense in which truth is more than merely avoiding contradictions. Perhaps it is the case that the denial of AC is the "truth of the matter" but we won't run into any contradictions if we assume AC is true and do mathematics using Zorn's lemma (which is equivalent) etc. This question is prompted as I'm reading "Metaphysics: An Anthology" edited by Kim, Korman, and Sosa. In it, there is an article by Plantinga "Modalities: Basic Concepts and Distinctions", it is stated that "The axiom of choice and the continuum hypothesis are either necessarily true or necessarily false...." 

In modal logic, we have the Rule of Necessitation (N): If A is a theorem, so is □A. So I'm quite surprised that 4 is an axiom that needs to be added. S4 is the system based off of K plus the addition axioms T and 4. But if I can do proofs in modal logic like I did them in ordinary logic, then why isn't it immediate that 4 is a theorem? "Proof" 1 Show □A ⊃ □□A 2 □ A assumption for Conditional Derivation 3 □(□A). by N Yeah, obviously this isn't cool. I can construct a frame that proves 4 isn't a theorem of T. Let 1,2,3 be three different worlds such that 1R1, 2R2, 3R3, 1R2, and 2R3 with A true at 1 and 2 and false at 3. Then □A is true at 1 and false at 2, therefore □□A is false at 1 (hence 4 could not be a theorem for if it were then because □A is true at 1, Modus Ponens would give us □□A true at 1 but it's also false, a contradiction). 

And without logical rules, no reasoning exist anymore, everything is possible. Only a system following logical rules may be labelled as consistent or not consistent. Here the system does not follow any logic. 

The atheists are the philosophers arguing against the existence of god(s). Among this list of people some are inevitable: Nietsche, Russel, Camus. I would also cite other well known atheists (but not really philosophers): Linus Pauling, Alan Turing and Richard Dawkins. There was also atheists in antiquity; Leucippus and Democritus who first imagined the atomic theory of matter. This list of 'brilliant' atheists is a good one. David Mills book 'Atheist Universe' presents most of modern atheists arguments. Our ancestors mainly needed supernatural explanations to account for bizarre empirical phenomena (thunders, earthquakes, but also the sun's heat, or why it does rain) or to answer ontological questions (why do I exist, where did the Earth comes from). Following that, most of the atheist arguments are that as we understand more and more deeply the World, there is less and less need for god(s) to explain our Universe. Common responses are, yes we know increasingly about our Universe, but we don't (and we won't) understand 100% of it, hence, god is still needed to explain the rest (for instance in Evolution vs Creationism, god is still needed to account for the lack of some transitional fossils). 

Nothing written in a book could convince anyone that it has been written by god. 3 reasons: Because any extraordinary written stuff could have been coincidentally written. A book with thousands (or more) of different ideas (not necessarily predictions) has a good chance that some of them could later be interpreted as real predictions or as ahead of its time impossible scientific discoveries. Because any book can be written randomly by a computer. A book is only a combination of limited letters (or symbols, ideogram etc. depending of the language) and any powerful machine can randomly create all possible books (if the book is not unlimited). So if you showed me a particular book and you told me it has been written by god, then I'd respond that a machine could have written this book or similarly that a human could have randomly created the book. The designer of the ideas in that book would then be chaos/chance/randomness which is far away from any god definition. Because we could live in a simulated reality in which any data could be produced by a super intelligent being in order to manipulate us. In this case, any extraordinary content displayed in the book (as predictions) could be explained as manipulations from the super-intelligent designers of this "matrix".
