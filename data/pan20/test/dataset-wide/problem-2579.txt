What you ware does not effect your path or your practice. In Lord Buddha's time people reached Nirvana while wearing nothing,While working and etc. Focus on your path do not take concerns about these minor things. 

Faith and Shraddha are two concepts people often get confused. Faith is more of a blind belief that encourage following without question. 

According to Buddhism someone who reach a higher level of Meditation (Samadhi) would be born in the Brahma realm. These beings are not sexually attracted to female gender (They don't have a female gender), They are with or without a Physical appearance. But when Buddhism describe the destruction of a universe it says that beings from almost all the realms are born in this "Ä€bhassara World" which is a Brahma world. 

There is a connection, If there was no suffering there is no nirodha. Let me give an explain from a famous teaching from Lord Buddha (The Four Noble Truths).... 

So what actually happens? There is a Bad Habit among some people, they dump unwanted Cats & Dogs near temples. Sadly some children got so called "Bad horoscopes" with predictions like This child is a lethal danger to the father or mother or something like that. As some people are obsessed with this so called "scientific practice" they tend to go to extremes. You would be surprised to know people walk away from marriages & relationships based on these predictions too. So now the "Puppy situation" comes into play. They take children to temples and make them become monks. The temple has no choice here because the temple can't send someone away when the situation is like that. There is another side to this.... Some parents can't take care of their children. So they would take boys to the temple to become monks. As the temple take care of their education and every other need.The parents are happy that their children are going to have what they would not have if they stay home. Knowing that some children would not stay in monkhood after they are old enough, the temple still to all that needs to be done for them. There is no bind keeping them from going back. Temples finance the learning of these new monks until they get a "Bachelor's degree". 

It will depend on the individual attentiveness on Dhamma. And what Buddha taught is volition depend on this one will have kusala or akusala. And mind(either kusala or akusala) is occurring once at a specific moment. If it is akusala, it can be called kusala. So in your action of every day activity interspersed every fine moment with dhamma, you will be getting kusala but not uninterrupted ones(sometimes it is better while there is absolutely not). Even animals listening attentively (though not knowingly the meaning), get kusala leading to higher abode. It is not brain washing. With these knowledge, contemplate the arising piti on what has done, will surely lead to higher nana stage. Mind matter most. 

Please refer to www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html If the meditation master is able to teach detail, one will be able to know which stage of nana is. If a person not yet attain enlightenment i.e. not yet got through all nana stages, he/she has to begin from the first nana stage and step by step going up to higher nana stage depending on individual sila and Samadhi. If one once got enlightened i.e., passed through all 16 nana stages, then next time meditation, begin from knowledge of arising and passing stage. If not trained and taught detail like that it cannot be easily distinguishable. But the most important thing is just to put much effort in meditation with sila and Samadhi, just like try to make fire by rubbing the two sticks or stone. Dhamma will show its characteristics in time. 

Whenever Buddha or Arahant said something, it is only for Nibanna. "Have you done this war with your own will to kill the enemy?" " Did you do that killing by your own will or because of the king ordered you to do so?" When these questions when heard by the king Dutugamunu of Sri Lanka, and the executioner, they felt like relax and had chance to listen to Dhamma and finally got better afterlife. This is just the questions not proving it is right. No one is spared for consequences of Karma even Buddha, sometimes having low back pain because of deliberately injuring the opponent in previous life. So there is NO JUST WAR. When Buddha time all the Ariya of Buddha relative got killed without any defense. So every body can do what one like only the consequence of Karma will have to be suffered later in the very life or afterlife. 

If I see the clinging and the stress going on at the five clinging aggregates can that propel me into stream entry? Like say I see that clinging is going on at the five clinging aggregates and I see that it's causing stress can that take me to enlightenment or is another method needed like seeing the rise and fall of the aggregates, or practicing the silavant: $URL$ sutta. Is it just a good overall practice anyway? 

Can insight into impermanence suffering and not-self be gained at any point in insight practice or do you have to go through all 7 purifications of insight? 

Do we focus on suffering as the suffering we're experiencing in the present moment or do we focus on suffering how the Buddha and Sariputta put forth and analyzed the four noble truths like: "Now what, friends, is the noble truth of stress? Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair are stressful; not getting what is wanted is stressful.[2] In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful." Do we just have to notice the actual mental experience of suffering as cause by craving or can we notice all its different manifestations, like the stress of the body or the stress of impatience? 

I know karma matures with the right conditions but does it ever force things to happen with the certainty that it will happen? Like for example can earning a specific karma say that it's going to force an effect, like when somebody does something good that means they'll become a private buddha in the future. Does it sort of "force" or push things in the direction of the karma to happen or is it still just waiting for the right conditions. 

Like say that someone gets cancer which is caused by karma. Now is that cancer staying on that person also sustained by karma, so that if the karma ran out then they would lose the cancer. Or someone wins the lottery, is them having that money also sustained by karma so that if the karma was depleted they would lose the money. When something bad happens does it go away when the karma causing it is depleted? Is the effect sustained by the initial karma or is the effect sustained by other karma. As soon as a karma runs out are you free from its effects or can other karma continue it effects. 

Clear and short as needed Buddha said, not to take verbatim. Just to praise the benefit of sotapanna. Sometimes one universe metaphorically said like one palm tree, just like that, suffering in long samsara(long, long duration) just compared to seven lifetime(just like a wink of eye) at the most of sotapanna. 

It so happened in progressing to higher stage of knowledge. Out of sixteen stage of knowledge regarding insight meditation, in the third stage it used to happen in somebody depending on the past merit. "intense emotional explosion in my chest" and "overwhelming bliss" if you note "know it" repeatedly or if you cannot concentrate any more just remember Arahan (one of the qualities of Buddha) until you can concentrate again. By doing so you can attain higher stage of knowledge. If you dare not do by yourself alone, go to one of the retreat and in front of the meditation master you can try again. Surely there will be no problem. 

Due to not knowing the true dhamma, those ordinary people are submerged in this rounds of birth and rebirth. To get to know the true Dhamma, one need to see things as they are, how these things come and go naturally. If you feel sad, you have to know it is so. All our deeds, bodily action, verbal or mental all should be clear of akusala but should be full of kusala. If once at a time if no kusala surely it is akusala. If you feel sad and you cannot get rid of this mental akusala as it is, then if you try to divert to other means which also lead to akusala will end in no good. So if you feel sad and you cannot concentrate on your meditation, then you can divert to the true nature of kamma result or focus on your attention on true characteristics of triple gems which will lead to your great relief and even more concentration leading to higher steps towards insight knowledge. 

Especially the stream-enterer in some cases if not fully guided by the meditation master will not be identify clearly which stage he/she achieve. Only with the help of the meditation master who can teach how magga and phala was achieved during practice will know exactly what is what. Once in Buddha time, one upathaka didn't know his afterlife whether might be in lower realm although he already entered sotapanna stage which I heard from one of my venerable sayadaw highlighting the importance of meditation master.
