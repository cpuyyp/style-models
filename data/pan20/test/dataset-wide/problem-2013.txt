It is obviously okay to talk to your manager and discuss your anxiousness but please take my advice and do not drop out on this presentation opportunity. This will always haunt you and you will always be scared about it. You can talk to your manager and clearly tell why you are scared and what would you like to make this experience easier on you. May be they can help in giving you some demo opportunities in front of smaller audience first. Or you can yourself ask your colleagues to sit in a presentation with you for practice. It is okay if your English is not perfect during the presentation as long as you have a great content. I have seen some excellent presentations in English by people who could barely speak the language. It is also okay to be little nervous but it is only experiences like this will make you comfortable for your next presentation. 

Talk to your manager and inform her that after 4 years in this team you are looking for a different role. Do not complain about your involvement. Whether they truly care for you or they really do not value your work, in either case she should support your decision to move and in fact help you in your lateral move. (Her intentions might be different but you do not have to worry about it) Start applying for other internal jobs after this initial discussion. Since you have already informed your manager about your intentions, it should be okay to apply to other positions in other teams. Start applying externally as well. Depending on the company size and politics, it may be easier for you to get a job you like outside than inside. 

I do not think any points you highlighted would "mislead" recruiter in anyway irrespective of level of your technical experience. So I think you can include these points in your cover letter. However, reading closely the points you have mentioned, you essentially have two major points to describe yourself. 

However confident you are about you getting another internship, if it is a good career opportunity at a good company, you should take it. Some opportunities do not come again. Slogging for sometime at an undergrad level balancing your internship and courses does not sound like a terrible thing and does not sound like a reason enough to drop the internship. 

Again, you answered this yourself that this MAY be perceived negatively and I do not think you should send such emails. Your interview call itself may be at risk if you already declare you are just exploring. (Unless you have exceptional credentials and very well known in research community and in the area which the company is interested in). Your entire purpose of interview is give the company a chance to understand you and also you get a chance to understand the role, company and the working culture. I do not think you will be misleading anyone if you do not disclose you are not sure of joining. Summing up, go ahead and make a full application and then decide with more information with you. 

I think in lot of eastern countries like where you are and where I am, importance is high on formal degree. That according to me could be your biggest problem in your own words. If you can still work on getting some credits to complete graduation, it may help to show on resume and get some more traction. Although, I wouldn't worry too much about not getting any response. I think it is very usual to not hear from anyone for hundreds of jobs. 

You sound more convincing and confident if you are telling the truth instead of making up a reason you yourself do not believe in. This is also fair in the company that they exactly know what makes you happy and can make an informed decision. Otherwise you yourself are in the risk of having the situation repeated. 

Let them do what they are doing and you do what you are most comfortable with (occasionally smile as you mentioned). If you come across as unfriendly then so be it. It should be not important to you and they would eventually stop expecting that from you. They do not like your personal attitude and you do not like theirs. You all can still be professional with this personal dislike and not fight with each other. This may not be perfect situation but I think this as best "good relations" you can maintain. As long as it does not effect any productivity or your career growth, then just go along with it. 

I was once like a milder version of your coworker! Not that creepy, bossy or old but just 2 years in my job I enjoyed delegating work to my junior colleagues. It took just couple of subtle hints from them that they did not appreciate me asking them to do something. Point is that this has to be communicated to your coworker somehow. Either directly by you or through your manager. You can first try to give hints yourself like referring to your boss every time he tries to be your boss like or first. (X being your boss). If these type of hints do not work, then you can be more direct and say If you still face the issue then best is to directly speak to your manager and express your concerns. You have to handle this carefully though because this escalation may result in some unnecessary confrontation and miscommunication. So make sure you do not accuse him of anything but just express concern about you are not clear what is his role. However way you decide, your coworker needs to know in a gentle way that you do not like his behavior around you. 

So my question is how do I handle this? Should I mind my own business and let my boss figure out the problem and solution on his own; Or go and talk to him explain the situation and risk low productivity for the company along with facing angry people. My day-to-day work does not get affected either ways. Edit: Just to clarify based on the answers and comments, no one is using pirated software. It is just that using personal laptop is easier than office issued Linux desktop(long story of why they decided to do that but it is valid reason) Also, I do not have authority to change policy or provide hardware/software. Also, my work and my responsibilities are not effected by this policy or people following it or not following it. 

I do not think you should ask for more compensation 90 days into the job even if you are doing more than you think you should be doing at this level. Sometimes the specific job duties you do are very difficult to categorize into one role or other. You may think you are at advanced role but very likely someone can make a very good counter argument to that. These things are usually are in grey area. Unless the line between the two roles is extremely clear and you are beyond any doubt and argument on the other side, I suggest let it go. You would not expect your company to deduct your salary in 90 days if you did not do the job you are currently assigned correctly. This will all go in your performance review and the compensation will be decided accordingly. If you are rated "exceeding expectations", it will surely influence your compensation review whenever it is due. 

I know lot of students in this situation every year and lot of them would just join the company knowing they will leave soon and just leave when they are ready to leave. However, that is never my suggestion and I do think it is unprofessional. 

Companies/Universities are (usually) well known and if you can, you should capitalize on the fame of the company first. That is your first identity. If you think about it, more often than not, you would introduce yourself as "I work for XYZ". If that company is well known, then that remains as your identify. Very few times, you get to talk about what your is designation in that company. Designations/Positions are very subjective and broadly varies from company to company. Senior Engineer at some place may be someone with 20 years of experience and at some places with 2 years of experience. Also in start-ups (and even in some big companies I know), these titles are just made up to impress the customer. (Like senior vice president, etc.) 

Just talk straight to your boss and ask her how you should plan your career in this company. Ask what your priorities should be this year and next year. Your boss will know you are serious about this role (assuming you are and she already does not know about it). Also, you will know how serious is your boss about keeping you in this company. Depending on the response you get and the confidence you have on her response, you can take a call on the other job offer which you already have. 

I think you should answer exactly what the question is and it is only about the children not about the dependents. 

This is very similar to my situation last year in the last company and I can tell you it will be a very emotional 1 month. Here are few things which I did and might help. 

I just got out of a pretty similar situation where the role and direction company promised me changed significantly because people who interviewed and offered me the role moved away. For all my interviews after that I made it clear why it did not work out in last company. I did not bad mouth them but I was very vocal that there are somethings (like the technology I work on) which I am very particular about and want to make sure it does not happen again. I do not think any company took it negatively and I got my next role fairly quickly. 

I understand this is not part of your job description but depending on how uncomfortable you are with the entire situation, you can at least give a fight to change things here rather than turning away directly. If you fail, you know you at least tried before you left. 

Not use rude or offensive language or complain about an individual by name or title. Answer very specific to the question being asked in the interview. Talk about the salary or compensation only if they specifically ask if you were happy with your salary and not when they something else like 'do you have any suggestions for the team/manager you are leaving?'. Also include some positive things (if any) you liked about the company and you would look forward to in your next role as well. 

Like I said, these things do need some convincing to management (even though there is no cost) and then making people read blog or watch videos. If it is really planned well, it can happen and if it does, I do think it will help improve companies morale without you travelling. 

Write an internal blog. Just your thoughts on the product you guys are building, related news in media, or just about business or personality development like some new team working strategy. Your colleagues should still read and frequently comment on it to make it meaningful but if that happens it would certainly make you and others feel more involved in company's success. There are several commercial tools which does that (like Yammer ) and there are several open-source ones also available like Slack. Make an internal video series of any technology which is needed for your product and the specific aspects of the technology which your employees in your team should learn. Any other DIY self-learning material and with benefit to your company would be a great motivation for you and for your team as well. If your management allows, it can be simply be a youtube private channel accessible only with accounts registered with email domain of your company. 

You do not. You gave your feedback but you do not know what criteria the hiring manager had in mind. May be they were looking for at least 1 positive feedback and does not matter who does that come from. May be HR gave good feedback as well. May be manager thought the candidate is overall good but could learn and pick up skills "on-the-job" which you thought they do not have. There are just so many possibilities. If your job description includes providing feedback based on technical interview and not be involved in final hiring decision, then this is exactly what you need to do. BTW, few years back I was myself hired even though a senior colleague of me gave negative feedback about me after my interview with him. My manager went by her gut feelings and I did very well in that role. My manager told me my hiring story few years later. 

It doesn't say anything about the culture of the company. It says exactly what it looks like. Executive assistant replied on Sunday. Nothing more or nothing less. Do not over-read the situation. Also, unless there is a reason you did not mention in the post, it does not make sense why you were not expecting a reply before Wednesday. Replying to emails is one the jobs EAs have. Whether they chose to reply on their holiday or during the workday is their business. 

Absolutely not and this can fireback on you if you attempted. You are hired for doing a particular job which I assume does not include making hiring decisions. (Worse yet, influencing hiring based on your personal attitude conflicts) Just focus on your job. You will have to work with all kinds of people throughout your career. You will never know about them before you (or they) join and you just have to deal with it. Why do you want to make it different now just because you know them already?
