In “Nausea” (“La Nausée”), a novel in the form of a fictional diary, Sartre makes the main character, the diarist, Roquentin, realize how baseless our assumptions about what is possible, what can happen in our world, or what gives the world its regularity, really are. For example: 

– roughly one quarter are wins and it seems intuitively the ratio would converge to 0.25. So obviously, just any and all infinite sequences, which converge “correctly” (like the first very regular one), will not do. They may in some sense not be “random” and so not admissible. But if we want to base our concept of probability on infinite sequences, we would at least need an exact grasp what infinite sequences are random and therefore admissible. Mises failed to give such a criterion. And so his analogy with the concept of velocity in physics breaks down, similar problems don't occur in the calculus machinery used there. It's still, by itself, a non-argument to just say that infinite sequences do not exist in observable reality. 

– can we interpret “The Stadium” so that it is not trivially fallacious? That it reaches a paradoxical conclusion with the same implicit metaphysical assumptions as his other paradoxes? PS: Okay this question keeps getting misunderstood. Again, please note: The question is NOT if Zeno assumed atomistic time and space here (there is no evidence for that, anyway!). The question is, how “The Stadium” can reach a paradoxical conclusion WITHOUT assuming atomistic time and space. 

On the other hand, I believe that "spiritual materialism (physicalism)" rests on a confusion. If we accept materialism, we have broadly two options. 

I think I can contribute some points even though I have to admit limited knowledge about Nietzsches philosophy. What I do know from biographical information ("Godess of the market" by Jennifer Burns) is that she was familiar and quite sympathetic to Nietzsche in her younger years. From that biography I also have the following quotation: 

(From beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche.) Rand tells us that she decided against using the quotation because it "proclaims psychological determinism" - something she abhorred. I believe that the quotation might be a key commonality between Nietzsche and Rand in contrast to most philosophers and intellectuals: To give one's own life importance rather than sacrifice it to something or someone else. In the foreword she goes on to say about the quotation: 

(The text before the double quotes is by Burns and she gives the sources as Journals, 291, 281 and 285.) As someone who is extremely appreciative of Rand and at least superficially familiar with Nietzsche I venture to guess that they indeed both understood by that the same (and to me rather obvious) idea: That only very few people achieve great things while a majority likes telenovelas. A more well-known connection to Nietzsche can be found in the foreword of "The Fountainhead", where Rand admits to have considered putting the following quotation in her novel: 

This view might be one of the crucial intersection of Nietzsche with Rand and thus give the impression of her being a blend of Nietzsche with something else. These points of contact nonwithstanding, the claim of Rand's philosophy being a blend of Nietzsche with American individualism is wrong. Since American individualism isn't an actual philosophy, it suffices to show philosophical work that has no precedence in Nietzsche. I've picked three articles that together spread over a range of fields in philosophy and should be comprehensible and intriguing. They should show that there are numerous gems of ideas in Rand's philosophical work - gems that (to my knowledge) are not of Nietzschean origin. I also made sure to pick unusual ones (as opposed to writings dealing with selfishness, capitalism and reason, which are the usual suspects when it comes to Rand). 

Was there some criticism of the "aether theory" along those lines by Aristotle's contemporaries? Did Aristotle try to give justifications how this counter-evidence is reconcilable with his theory? 

Assumption as in blind faith? No. But “assumption” that we need rational insight beyond formal proofs, yes. The “assumption” that the axiom systems lack internal contradiction (= one is able to derive both a theorem and its negation from the axioms) is usually necessary for mathematics. That would be the easy answer. More difficult is the question of applied mathematics, because mathematics is obviously applied directly in many cases, not just as a tool of a clearly empirical science like physics. If we put together 1 l of a blue chemical and 1 l of a red chemical and create a purple mixture, mathematics can't tell us, of course, that we will get 2 l of purple mixture. But the curious thing is that if we do get, say, 1.8 l of purple mixture, we don't shrug it off like “Well, mathematics doesn't have anything to do with reality anyway!”, no, we look for an explanation, like a chemical reaction or physical causes, for this “abnormal behavior”. The usual mathematical operations, from +, -, /, * to differentiation & integration, seem to mirror an abstract “ideal behavior” of the real world, and that's something that can't be justified empirically. But for somebody to call this blind faith he must have developed a strong allergy to anything that looks a bit like rationalism. 

Those issues are connected to the foundational crisis of mathematics in the early 20th century. Russell, Frege and Gödel were mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics; it's nearly impossible to imagine they could have done their important (for mathematics) work if they lacked the “philosopher of mathematics”-part. At the very least it was the motivation for their research. Why should one even be interested in logicism, for example, if one thinks the analytic-synthetic distinction is just some totally useless philosophical ivory-tower-theory? Similar issues arise in modern theoretical physics, like the interpretation of quantum mechanics – as David J. Griffiths remarked:
