Yes they absolutely did. I know this because I've been in several of them. However it was only in the most dangerous places - the criticality labs, where there was enough nuclear materials that, if mishandled, they could generate a fatal radiation dose in a matter of seconds. Most nuclear power stations would not have had a criticality lab and hence not an alarm of this kind. Only places like a research establishment (where I heard them) or a fuel rod assembly facility would have had them. The sound was a short electronic bip every few seconds, not a 'ha' or anything else that could be mistaken for a human voice. I suppose different places may have used different sounds, but the ones I visited were all the same. The sound played 24/7 and stopping indicated a criticality. The action if it stopped was to run as quickly as possible towards the nearest exit until you were a safe distance away. I was only ever a visitor, but I was told by the people who worked there regularly that you got used to it quickly and really noticed if it stopped. I will try to look out references, but I thought I'd post this until I found them. 

Yes, tanks of gasoline can explode, given the right conditions. The Quebec town of lac Megantic was recently flattened by a number of huge explosions from derailed cars carrying light crude. (And not big-flamey-Hollywood explosions but kill-hundreds-of-people explosions). One of the reasons given for the explosions was that the "oil was more volatile than previously thought, having characteristics similar to unleaded gas". On a smaller scale, there have been warnings published about the explosive capabilities of ordinary gas cannisters. Other incidents include this, this, number 4 here and this. As to whether the traditional Hollywood method of ignition, firing a small calibre handgun at an inches-thick metal tank would cause such an explosion, I'll leave that for another question. 

The evidence for this is in fact remarkably sparse. The only reputable work that claims Newton as a homosexual is the book Sir Isaac Newton: Brilliant Mathematician and Scientist: (by Natalie M. Rosinsky) Even this book admits that there is no hard evidence - it simply says "their letters suggest that their affection for one another was romantic." There are a number of newspaper reports that cite the claim, but all of them are essentially quoting this one book. 

Apparently not In The American West: A New Interpretive History by Robert V. Hine, John Mack Faragher, they quote the annual homicide rate of Dodge City (one of the towns mentioned by Ridley) as 50 per 100,000 people. That would make it higher than any modern day US city except New Orleans and Detroit. The book Homicide: A Sociological Explanation by Leonard Beeghley gives a table of homicide rates for cattle towns in the period. Abilene, Wichita and Dodge had homicide rates of 76, 91 and 160 (per 100,000 residents) respectively, much higher than any modern day US city. The Bodie Daily Free Press reported in 1881 "Bodie is becoming a quiet summer resort - no-one was killed here last week" The book Rethinking Homicide by Meithe, Regoeczi and Drass quote McKenna 1997 as saying that Abilene had a murder rate of about 80 per 100,000, Dodge City peaked at 160, and Bodie CA at around 116. This is not incompatible with the statement of 1.5 murders per town - the population of Dodge City in 1876 was 1,200, meaning that 1.5 murders would be the equivalent of a 125 homicide rate per hundred thousand population. However it does mean that the conclusion that this figure is "lower than the murder rate today" is completely false. A homicide rate of 125 would be much higher than any city in the modern US. This level was not universal, however, Douglas County, Nebraska (where Omaha City is located) reported a homicide rate of 3.7 per 100,000 in the 1880s, similar to the homicide rate of northern towns of the time and low for modern US cities.. It is conceivable that some towns in the 'Wild West' had low murder rates - but that was not the norm for the cattle towns. Research on the subject turns up a number of anti-gun-control websites claiming a low level of violence in the West. One of the most widely quoted makes this claim: 

It's hard to prove a first, because you have to prove that it has never happened before. However the preponderance of evidence seems to be in favour of it. The evidence comes in two kinds. 

The document in which the actions mentioned were proposed is named, dated and given an author in reputable publications, including the New York Times and Evan Thomas' life of Robert Kennedy and the Associated Press. All quote it as a 'recently declassified memo' The Wikipedia article gives other references. It is pretty inconceivable that the memo is a hoax. However we should beware of excessive outrage on this subject. It's clear from all the sources that the 'proposals' were never acted on, and we have no records of the context. The writers may have been asked to submit all ideas, no matter how outrageous. Or they may have been proposed seriously. We don't have that information. 

The numbers may not be right, but the tendency is. The fact that men are more likely to be struck by lightning than women is backed up by several scientific studies. NASA backs this up but says that it is four times as many men as women. NOAA has a very detailed breakdown of lightning strikes: 

Gladstone did not say this or anything like it in the House of Commons as claimed. It is a simple matter to check every time Gladstone said the word 'book' in the House of Commons, and none of them are anything like the claim. Since Tommy Robinson's claim is explicitly that he said this in the Commons we know that it is false. We also know that at the very least that the authors quoted in other answers have not done their research properly. Because something is written in a published book does not automatically mean it is correct. Please also see and vote up DavePhD's excellent well-researched answer. It is conceivable that he made a similar claim outside the Commons, or that it was not recorded in Hansard (Hansard was not an exhaustive record that far back) but the absence of times or dates, the inconsistency of the statement with Gladstone's other verified statements, and the absence of any mentions of this statement prior to the 1950s cast serious doubt on that. 

Several points to answer here. First is that the whole physics basis of your friend's scheme is fundamentally flawed. Electrolysis creates hydrogen and oxygen from water by breaking chemical bonds, using the energy from electricity. Combustion of hydrogen creates water from hydrogen and oxygen by reforming the bonds, releasing the bond energy as heat. If you performed these actions with perfect efficiency you would get back in the combustion the energy you put in with the electroysis. Since the processes are (much) less than perfect, you end up getting considerably less back. In other words the electrolysis to generate the hydrogen will always take more energy than you get back from the combustion. If your friend has a source of hydrogen other than electroysis that is a different matter. One of the scenarios in which Ballard Power recommends fuel cells is for chemical plants that already produce hydrogen. (Thanks to Randolf Richardson for that link) To move on to the legal question, most jurisdictions have no laws about generating your own electricity. I can't speak for the various US states, but in Canada plenty of off-grid homes have their own generating equipment. However there certainly are regulations about what you can connect to the grid, and you need some kind of approval in order to put power into the grid. Another aspect is that storage and use of flammable gasses in any quantity requires permits (for what I hope are obvious reasons if you think about the consequences of untrained and irresponsible people handling them) and there are rules governing them. Your friend would have to abide by them in order to get his scheme working. See here. If the farmer in the story was arrested because he had lots of hydrogen stored in an unsafe way, then that was nothing to do with 'free energy', and was probably a good thing for his neighbours. Finally, as Randolf Richardson points out, there are certainly installations of fuel cells which have been approved. See the Ballard link above. The Men in Black have so far not come to arrest any of the installers for reducing the profits of Big Power. 

Since domestic violence is logically a subset of assaults, there cannot have been more reported injuries due to domestic violence than due to traffic accidents. Reasons why these might not be the truth Domestic abuse is very much an under-reported crime. For example where a partner is 'persuaded' not to go to a hospital or report their injury, if it's 'only' a severe bruise or a black eye, or a cut (or maybe it's worse). Or where the injury is reported as 'walked into a door' or some other lie. There are plenty of papers that attempt to give estimates of the degree of under-reporting, or to estimate injury rates by other means than reporting statistics. 

The Confectionary Industry's own newsletters acknowledge the problem. The BBC has repeated stories. New organizations from the UK and Canada have picked up the stories. The US Department of Labor considers it an issue. In short there is an abundance of evidence for this. 

The article also points out reasons why use of Hitler's name is not as taboo as it is in the West. Fewer Indians are aware of The Holocaust, or Hitler's role in World War II. There is also a significant body of opinion that viewed the British colonialists as evil oppressors of India, and were inclined to look more favourably on anyone who opposed them. Even during World War II there was a substantial body of opinion that favoured allying with the Axis in order to free India from Colonialism. 

In short that does not mean "we did controlled tests on all medical procedures, and only 10-20% were found to be effective", it means "we have only done enough controlled tests to show that 10-20% of procedures were effective". That is very different from what FreedomHealthCanada is claiming. Note first that this is from 1978, and things have changed a lot since then. Second the OTA did NOT think this was a good state of affairs, even then, and wanted more clinical trials. Quite a lot of procedures are of course known to be effective without the benefit of controlled trials. There are also a large number of procedures where it would be unethical to do a controlled trial - such as performing CPR on only half the patients with a stopped heart to see how many recovered. 

Ridley is cherry-picking to an enormous extent, such that even if his statements are technically true they are without meaning. Analysis of fibrous materials using X-ray crystallography did indeed contribute to the study of DNA structure, and the techniques may well have been used in the wool industry. However those studies themselves were dependent on earlier work, including the X-ray crystallography of crystals. There were also studies of and other inorganic materials, the theoretical development of X-ray crystallography, and the study of non-fibrous organic molecules (such as cholestrol, penicillin and vitamin B12), none of which area in any way related to the wool industry. These are in turn dependent on basic studies of refraction, such as the development of Bragg's Law. Use of X-rays in the textile industry was dependent on the basic science contributed by Scherrer, Herzog and Jancke. All of these contributed to the analysis of DNA, yet Ridley chooses not to mention them for reasons of his own. References: 

Data from GovTrack. Resolutions are what GovTrack calls "simple resolutions". What I've called Bills is anything that was signed by the President. I believe this is necessary for anything that actually changes, even if its for renaming a post office. Simple resolutions are the sort where "The House resolves that...". The summary seems to be that where it counts (bills signed by the President) Ryan is about on the average for his contemporaries. However the numbers are so low that it is not fair to draw any meaningful conclusions. He is much lower on resolutions passed and lower for bills introduced. I have to add that I am deeply skeptical that this tells us anything useful about Ryan or anyone else. 

These countries typically have a larger field of candidates for electors to choose from than the US. 

This is completely untrue. Several news sources debunk the claims. The New York Times lays out the relevant facts: 

That's not to say the bill isn't controversial. Many people are opposing it on the grounds of increased regulatory burden on small food producers and sellers. Many people are supporting it since it holds food producers responsible for contaminated food, and makes it easier to track the source of such food. But in the specifics of this question, no. As one article puts it, Grandma's home grown pickles are safe. 

There are a huge number of studies that do indicate that exercise is good for you, in that it reduces your chance of getting various serous diseases, and hence causes you to live longer. The link is widely recognised. Having said that, these things are always a statistical likelihood. If they have a genetic problem, or are just plain unlucky, some people will get a serious disease and peg out when they are forty, no matter how much they exercise. Some people who don't exercise get lucky and live to be a hundred. It's a statistical thing. Professional athletes are a bad example because they also push their bodies to, or sometimes past, the limits and will give themselves health problems because of it. (It's also true that extreme exercise isn't necessarily better for you than moderate exercise.) With genetics there are sometimes many people in a family who die early despite exercise, or die late despite lack of it. If you're going to get cancer when you're fifty, exercise probably won't make much difference to your lifespan. But in general if you want to live as long as you can, your chances are much greater if you do your exercise. Some studies that show up easily on the internet are here. There are hundreds more.
