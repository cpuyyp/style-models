I imagine a world like Earth, only without easy mineable copper (say, where copper was as rare as gold). That means no brass nor bronze too (they are copper alloys). I presume prehistoric humans could discover metallurgy using other easily melted metals (tin, lead). So they would pass directly from stone age to iron age. I don't know if steam engines would be feasible. Do they require any significant amount of copper, brass or bronze? Electricity could be discovered using batteries based on zinc or lead, but without copper wiring it would remain little more than a scientific curiosity. Electric motors and generators require large amount of wiring, so they are impossible to build on large scale in this world. Some small units could perhaps be made using silver wiring in place of the copper ones. Possibly, wiring in internal combustion engines could also be made out of silver. That would make them very expensive, though. Aluminum, which requires large amount of electricity to be refined from ore, would be a rare metal, therefore airplanes, if ever developed, would be made out of wood. In sum, that would mean a world fixed at a tech level of the late 1800, gaslit and with very few cars, with very expensive air travel, no telegraphs nor phones, nor radio, with only mechanical computing machines. Edison would be mainly known for the phonograph. Any other thoughts ? UPDATE: if there is no economical way to produce and distribute electricity, a lot of conseguences would follow for the organization of society. Instead of huge power plants that serve millions of users located perhaps hundreds of miles away, there would be small plants serving a single building or city block, distributing energy in form of steam or compressed air. There would probably be no "NIMBY" movements, given that there would be no alternative to a plant in each backyard. I wonder if this would lead to a more or a lesser "green" society. Also living "off the grid" would be the norm, not the exception. 

Not All 4 Need to be Blades A body morphology like the one used for one of the invasive alien species in the half life spin-off Opposing Force would work. 

Sterling Engines The ship once contained at its blazing heart a massive reactor that blazed like a burning star. The knowledge and ability to run and maintain it at full light has long since faded and now it simply smolders on its lowest idle level. But even so it still produces a fair amount of heat. Stirling engines have been attached to it (which have existed since the 1800's). The heated side of a cylinder causes air to expand and drive a piston, which compresses the air on the unheated side rendering it hotter, which then drives the piston back. This turns a crankshaft and as long as equilibrium between the unheated and heated side is maintained the piston will continue to drive it's crankshaft. They are generating electricity, but at a low level, on par with the 1800's level of power generation. They use very simple low voltage circuits to accomplish what tasks require electricity (in space you will always need at least SOME electricity). 

If you are in a world of SkyNet and Terminators, it could be technologically possible. The fastest ones in Greenland move 10 miles a year. A city under a glacier would be transported away at that speed in it's entirety except for the basements, it could be similar to searching for bullion from a ship in the deep ocean. SkyNet has large energy capabilities, and it could blast large access holes through 2km of ice, maintain them, and then mine for debri in the rock bed. if you use nuclear and TNT or major heat sources you can completely get through a glacier and divert it. They could literally just put in black substrate and lazer it using the sun. The gold would not move fast if it was protected by overlying material, and it would always tend to sink under other rocks. If you got there within a some years and you said that the vault was on a protected hillsidre or in a basement it would be ok. A glacier doesn't dig that fast vertically every year. 

Even cows and goats aren't peaceful animals. peace is a human imaginary ideal. Peace from uniformity, on earth is due to herd structures like bees and ants, and this would have to keep huge intelligence structures available to organize the society. similarity can be due to lack of partiality in the brain, so perceived facial equality, wether emotional or monotonous, actual physical equality, by miosis or genetic engineering, clades of workers and nurses and things. An evolutionary logical adaption towards equal beings, is unlikely, because survival requires change and flexibility and improvement, so equality reduces survival and flexibility. superintelligent beings coudl have just a chip in their head that overrides their antisocial instincts. 

I currently work in corrections. The Denver Jail would suffice. Jails that are decades old are often still in use today. A county lockup nearby where I live was built in the 60's, aside from the occasional new coat of paint and some new doors installed it is still in full use housing about 50 inmates. Jails are already built like fortresses, and wouldn't be looted since jails contain very little in the way of anything valuable, and are also pretty hard to get into. Best part, the entire layout and infrastructure of the building is totally designed for holding unwilling captives and deterring nosy outsiders. I suggest the Denver department of corrections prison building. Its big enough to hold all the merchandise but also fortress-like enough for your aspiring indentured servitude merchants to protect themselves and their profits. A prison after the apocalypse would basically be a free castle for whomever has the manpower and gumption to take it and use it as such. 

Weaponized MRSA MRSA is an antibiotic resistant form of staph infection. In extreme cases it becomes a flesh eating disease that causes hideous sores and necrosis in it's victims. It is transmitted via skin to skin contact, or contact with items recently in contact with an infected individual. I think you need to dial down your expectations for what a disease can do though. The idea that something is crazy virulent enough to be transmitted via water, air, touch and bodily fluid AND linger as a lethal strain outside of its host within the surrounding environment for decades is basically a planetary extinction level event. Its also not very possible due to some factors I will detail here. Diseases actually trend towards evolving to become less lethal rather than more lethal. The longer a disease can exist within a host while contagious without killing them the more it can reproduce, in addition organisms develop immunity to the disease over time. It is a dance between natural selection factors, every so often a new strain emerges from a mutation and causes periodic outbreaks that are less severe than the original but still dangerous. Decades after the war symptom-less carriers exist within the human and animal populations. People are by and large immune by this point but children, the elderly, and people with poor immune systems still occasionally catch it and die. Every once in a blue moon a more virulent strain might mutate and cause localized outbreaks within regions. The ultimate pinnacle of bacterial and viral evolution is not to kill as many hosts as quickly as possible, but to hit a point of equilibrium within its host population. You can brew up very virulent plagues, but keeping them that way long term is not possible, nor is it prudent to use such organisms as a weapon. 

A missing parameter in the question is: are robots legally people, or only machines? If they are machines, then everything they produce belongs to their human owners, so humans interact with the economy. If robots are people, then they have full rights and they own what they produce. Much of what is produced (not everything, because of the comparative advantage, as many pointed out) is by robots, and probably for robots too. This scenario is similar to others: - if genial people from the past (Einstein, Shakespeare, Mozart, Raphael) could be cloned, what would become of normally-talented people ? - if by genetic manipulation some kind of superhumans (an order of magnitude better than the average human) could be created, what would happen to the ordinary people ? At the beginning, everything is owned by humans; as robots/cloned geniuses/superhumans begin to produce, the fraction of wealth owned by humans is doomed to be by and by reduced. In the long term robots/etc. own almost everything, and humans are pushed to the sides of the economy. Look at what happened to the Neanderthals. It's also conceviable that not all robots would be able at the same level: some among them would be obsolete, or defective, or faulty. What would happen to them ? They cannot simply be shut down and discarded (they are people after all, with right to life, liberty and property). 

My great grandfather was a survivor of the soviet gulags, in his various stories about how bad it was he often stated that they could be worked as much as 14-16 hours a day. Thing is, the gulags goal wasn't really economic profit so much as extermination of undesirables through labor and starvation. What you describe in your setting isn't really slavery so much as genocide. In situations where the captors goals are profit they typically take better care of their slaves, since a beaten and starving wretch cant really accomplish much of any real value and is prone to revolt and acts of sabotage. 

Nuclear Powered Snowmen "Renewable" energy kinda sucks- Solar is only viable when you have the panels made in near slave labor conditions in china where the toxic byproducts of the manufacture can be legally dumped into a river, then heavily subsidize their sale once they arrive in the wealthier nation. If the panels were made in a developed nation with adequate environmental controls and well paid workers and the government didn't use taxes to subsidize their sale they would cost more than they would ever produce in electrical output during their entire lifetime. Did I mention that solar panels require lots of fossil fuels and massive amounts of energy to manufacture? IF a solar panel produces at optimum output for its entire lifespan it might, MIGHT break even on how much energy was required to produce, transport, install and maintain it. No system will ever operate at optimum output at all times, thus most solar panels you see haven't even made up the deficit created by their construction yet and wont for another 15 to 20 years, by which time they will need to be replaced. Wind is an unpredictable source of power and only works to supplement a power grid's output. A grid ran entirely off of wind power would not be a reliable and viable option, wind turbines are how power companies convince you to ignore the coal powered steam turbines that perform the majority of the workload. They are also only really viable to build cost effectively when using cheap 3rd world slave labor and massive government subsidies. Geothermal is cost prohibitive anywhere that geothermal activity is not occurring close to the surface. This means you really can't choose where you are building them, and the locations where geothermal activity is accessible is not going to necessarily be where you want to build a city or power plant. Tidal is periodic output, it only produces power during tidal activity. Like wind, it is only going to useful to augment an existing grid, not replacing it entirely. Also you have all that ice stopping you from using it for long periods of the year. Nuclear reactors kinda don't- Nuclear reactors are actually quite safe and efficient now days. The old fashioned reactors were more dangerous due to possessing more primitive computers and were based on older theories of nuclear physics. Why not thorium reactors? Thorium is a lot more common than uranium or plutonium, more stable and easier to control, less expensive to refine, and cannot be weaponized into nuclear bombs. The best part of a nuclear reactor using thorium is that it does not have complicated control rods as saftey measures. The idea that a computer could fail or something could get stuck and cause a meltdown doesn't exist. Thorium reactors keep the thorium suspended in a pool of molten salt. Pull the plug and drain the molten salt and thorium into a series of sub-critical mass tanks and that's it. Fission stops. No melt down. Stopping a thorium reactor is basically just as simple as pulling the plug on a giant bathtub. Nuclear power being depicted as "that crazy thing we can't believe we were into back in the 50's" is kinda mostly due to petroleum company lobbyists trying to justify why we ought to keep burning their products like we have been since the 1800's. Also apparently coal miners are heroic blue collar patriotic figures that require constant protection from evil communists. Said coal miners could just be used to mine thorium instead. "green" energy lobbyists also attack nuclear power to serve their own goals and hide their own shortcomings and schemes. I'm all or renewable energy, but the people aren't really renewable, aren't really producing much energy, cant make profits without being given our tax money, and are actively obstructing more viable clean power options. Your more pragmatic snow-men see this and develop measures that don't just politically advertise well, but work well too. 

It's an animal behaviour question. Ants and bees and to some extent cows do this. Can humans have no territorial, sexual, racial, criminal, adventurous instincts, and no fear of death in service of it's community? Primates typically don't. It's the same as news reports about racist and sexist issues, they bypass the human rational system because they act on primate self defence instincts that act in the periphery of your concious vision and make you react emotinally faster than you have actually visually identified the subject, through a primitive fast neural pathway. It means that you have to re-program the brain significantly to make the individuals less carnivorous and tribal and more like ungulates like cows. Cows don't have tribal wars and they are settle their ownership disputes once a year and are relatively peaceful, the female cows are not very agressive. Indian Sadhus are supposed to live selflessly, but they have to defend themselves because most of the population still acts with ownership. Legal structures to turn primate instincts into a benign society are very complex in our own society. You have an idealist argument of a utopic nature which sidelines the human behavioural aspect. Everything in the human sphere today is about crowd control and primate emotions, personal thirst for blood, racism, sex, socialising, playing, thrills, and territory. The communist doctrine was written at a time with very low workers rights and worker pay in factories and was relatively good, except that it didn't give a mechanism of action, Ghandi did, and if communism and Ghandhism had some kind of combination of fervor and method, perhaps communism could have survived a bit long in spite of it's flaws. 

Your concoction is Literal Madness in a bottle In Afghanistan I was routinely awake for days on end, a state achieved by drinking Monster, coffee, and red-bull like it was water. Its been years since I served and my circadian rhythm is still screwed up. Hell, a recent study by the military states that I and my brethren probably have permanent "circadian scarring" from such practices. On top of that, I was once awake for 4 days repelling a major attack from our area of operations. By the time day 3 had ended I and my comrades were actually attempting to open fire at hallucinated phantom enemies, some guys would suffer random outbursts of hysterical screaming. We spent 2 days after sleeping and waking up to eat and not much else, none of us were anywhere near being mentally mission capable for another 2 weeks after that. Caffeine just doesn't work like magic no-sleep juice. When you go more than a few days without sleep by using stimulants you begin causing severe (possibly even permanent) damage to your mind, organs, and nervous system. In any case, you can buy 100% clinically pure powdered caffeine by the pound online that does not posses any appreciable flavor or scent what so ever. You can add as much as you like to whatever you want if you are looking to overdose and induce cardiac arrest and seizures. There is no plausible reason to synthesize a strain of toxic coffee bean to do so. 

I am working on a story where ballistic weapons are completely banned across the entire planet in favor of smell, sound, and drug-weapons. For example, the police are equipped with somnambulizers and hilaritazers, depending on the situation... somnambulizers make someone sleep instantly, and hilaritazers have a LSD related substance, which makes people laugh and forget where they are. A huge metropolis in Texas has become rebellious and has 3D printed guns and ballistic weapons and has walled off the city, and the big brother has to make everyone flee from the city safely, using only smell, sound, and drug based weapons, so they can attend citizen-responsibility classes to read the little red book. What kinds of sensory and drug based tactics can the government use, from rotten fish, tranquilizers, LSD, fluffy toys that sing, to make the city completely docile and make people flee from it, without killing anybody? 

The Question has minor flaws. Earth is too near to the sun, and it's only saved by it's moon which provides a large magnetic disruption in the earth. So, the first thing to ask is: how do you create an earth and moon. It's a reason why habitable planets can be alot rarer than scientific extrasolar dreamers say it is, the chances of having a moon able to make so much magnetic shield, in a habitable zone is small. The habitable zone is wide and can be optimized using CO2 and atmospheric greenhouse, you could be 15 million miles and be ok, half way between the earth and mars. Two planets in the same orbit is naturally unstable and doesn't occur in practice. you would have to place a planet further or closer for more safety. If you had the same orbit and needed to adjust it, it would likely create earthquakes and by counterproductive to the colony. You can have one planet nearer to the sun, and one further away, by 15million miles. It should be possible to hurl ice at mars and move it's orbit inwards, if you double it's size, you can provide a certain amount of momentum to send it 15,000,000 kilometers from earth. mars is 30mn away and the moon is 1/4million away.
