So, the answer to the question, is no. The message being passed around Facebook doesn't understand the cause of common blindness and the treatment. [1] $URL$ [2] Whitcher et al Corneal blindness: a global perspective $URL$ 

The question above is a little confused mixing claims about Ancel Keys' 7 countries study which he organised, and his 6 (22) countries study. These studies are commonly confused. The 6 (22) countries study was one he authored himself and presented in 1953 at a symposium at Mt. Sinai Hospital, New York City. Some of the work came from field work done in Europe 1951-1952 when he was a Senior Fullbright Fellow headquartered at Magdalen College, Oxford, and other data came from research grants from the National Heart Institute, and the National Dairy Council, Chicago. In the paper he describes his methods and he discusses the validity of death certification. He excludes 

There are two questions. One is whether it's possible to diagnose malaria with a non-invasive device, and two whether that device could involve a smartphone with software. It's clearly possible to non-invasively diagnose cerebral malaria by examining the retina using either direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy [1]

Although methotrexate has been used for years now to treat psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with the impression of good effectiveness in both treating physicians, and patients, there has been scant proof of such effectiveness. The latest and most comprehensive data we have is from the 2012 MIPA trial [1]

I've gotten an e-mail to this effect a couple of times now, mainly centering around the story behind the song "Amazing Grace". The basic idea is that old Negro spirituals were based on the black keys of the piano because slaves weren't permitted to touch the white keys. Amazing Grace was written by a former slaver, and the assertion is that he heard the tune from his slaves. This sounds like total BS. First off, there's no piano out on the cotton plantation, and the slaves' quarters were very unlikely to have had one either. Second, a house slave might be trained to play piano for the enjoyment of the household, but in that case, it seems equally unlikely that the tutor would only teach the student the black keys. Lastly, the black keys, when played in sequence, form a pentatonic scale (not the only one but the easiest one), and this scale is common not only in certain African tribal forms, but in numerous European and Asian cultures. Anyone have any proof or disproof of this thesis? 

Artificial banana flavor was derived from natural banana flavor; bananas, both Gros Michel and Cavendish, as well as other varieties including "wild" bananas, contain isoamyl acetate, amyl acetate and related compounds which result in their smell and taste. The synthesis of isoamyl acetate from other sources (namely the reaction of isopentanol aka amyl alcohol with acetic acid as found in vinegar; the acid deprotonates the alcohol to form an ester) allowed for the replication of banana flavoring on a mass-producible scale without the need for natural banana extracts; however, because it's only one such compound in the full palette of "banana oil", it produces a one-note flavor. That flavor is recognizable as banana, by taste and smell, but it was never meant to be an accurate reproduction of any one variety of banana; merely a cheap reproduction of the species in general. Other similar synthetics that have come to dominate use of the natural flavoring include methyl salicylate (the key ingredient of oil of wintergreen, and so close that hardly anybody bothers with the natural stuff anymore), and hydroxymethoxybenzaldehyde aka vanillin, used in place of natural vanilla extract in most brands of vanilla ice cream (and other flavors; it adds a creamier flavor to chocolate, for instance).

The short answer is not really. The longer answer is that, while a silencer (aka suppressor) does dramatically reduce the report of a handgun, the sound of the pistol doesn't universally transform into the audio clip that has become a movie standard (some would say cliche). The Mythbusters tried this one as part of their "Sounds Bogus" episode dealing with movie audio versus real-world sounds. They called their results "plausible" due to the reduction in sound level, but did state that the sounds they recorded did not match the movie sounds. Here's the digest of that myth including what silencers really sound like on "defense-caliber" pistols. $URL$ The trademark "silenced pistol shot" sound in most movies is usually some variant on a suppressed .22 target pistol. That pistol is stereotypically common in the hands of close-in assassins (another movie myth; anyone who could get close enough to be lethal with a 22 has many better options) and therefore the sound it makes has become associated with all silenced pistols. 

The main benefit from flossing appears to be to reduce gingivitis or gum inflammation. Presumably it does this by removing food from the interdental spaces because there is only weak evidence it removes plaque which might be causing gingivitis. This Cochrane review concludes [1] 

That article doesn't provide references, and so is suspect. Any drug needs to have the effect replicated in multiple independent laboratories to verify efficacy. We do have some experimental evidence that beetroot juice has some cytotoxicity for several tumour lines but the effect is much less than a standard chemotherapeutic drug such as Adriamycin [1]

I don't think the viruses responsible for the common cold can hide in the bone, though CMV can hide in the bone marrow. You mentioned rhinoviruses, and these infect epithelial cells. As to the question as to whether some of the viruses responsible for the common cold can hide, and then emerge to reinfect people, then the evidence seems to be yes where adenovirus persists inside lymphoid tissue eg tonsils.[1] 

There seems to be a little confusion in the original statements quoted from the Mirror. First they say they use sheep placental tissue, and then they say they use amniotic fluid derived stem cells. The latter is taken from the sheep uterus under ultrasound guided aspiration. As to the efficacy of these treatments, I guess once we see wool growing over Victoria Beckham's eyes, we will know it worked. In the meantime, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS) and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) released a position statement on the use of stem cells ( from humans I would imagine ) in aesthetic surgery: 

Not only is there a fear of losing part of the penetrating object, but barbed objects might also cause more damage as they are removed. In this report of a spear gun penetrating the skull of a 9 year old child, they advise that [2] 

However, the authors conclude that surgery is not cost-effective way of treatment, and most cases are actually preventable. Note also that corneal transplant requires the use of eye banks, and other sophisticated medico-surgical infrastructure. 

The cause of diabetes appears to be a combination of a high fat diet in conjunction with reduced exercise. Populations that have had historically high carbohydrate intake have not been prone to diabetes so this theory of a high white rice diet is likely incorrect without other factors being present. The prevalence of diabetes in China in 1980 was estimated at < 1%, 2.5% in 1994, 5.5% in 2001, and 11.6% in 2013 [0] illustrating how dietary changes have impacted on disease prevalence. If we look at animal studies where rats are fed high fat diets, we see:[1] 

No official recognition of a slave by the name Jenkins is made. Any further claim that the true/hidden reason has to do with a slave would be a question of motivation, and therefore off-topic here. 

Now whether the nutrients studied here constitute "important vitamins" is an exercise left to the reader. According to another study from the Journal of Food Science (paywall), summarized here: 

Smith has also talked about the incident in other places, including with Charlie Rose. If you're doubting whether Smith lied about the gamble, I doubt casino records exist which could prove that he won $27,000 on such a bet--and if they did, they would probably require a court order to reveal them. 

The article speaks in broad generalizations, and uses scary but vague phrases like "standard protocol" and "drench" to support its claims. To what extent, if any, is the claim true that roundup is applied to non-GMO crops (specifically wheat) shortly before harvest? And for bonus points, if this is common in the US, is it uncommon elsewhere (as implied by the claim)? 

There is no citation, and my attempts to find relevant studies on Google have only resulted in similarly unsourced claims, but usually in praise of team-building exercises. Are there actually studies that show that HR-style "team-bonding" exercises promote distrust? 

These assumptions ought to lead to artificially high workforce figures for my following estimate, but should provide us with a useful upper-bound to weigh Mr. Limbaugh's claim against. 1992 had a natural population growth of 1,889,401, so this many new workers will be entering the workforce this year, given our assumptions. In 2010, 1,042,626 legal immigrants came to the U.S. (We'll use the same number for 2012, since it's the latest data available). This gives us 2,932,026 new workers in 2012. So to maintian our current employment rate, we'd need to create, on average, 244,336 jobs every month. I'd say Mr. Limbaugh was off by at least a factor of 2-3. Unless, of course, he's pining for the rights of illegal immigrants who don't get counted in these numbers, and who cannot file for unemployment benefits. :) 

It doesn't seem to cite any source, although I've heard similar claims before. I've also experienced first-hand anecdotal evidence that holding my nose reduces the sensation of taste when eating. But I've also heard (I can't find sources now) that these claims are largely exaggerated. What do actual studies say the relationship is between a human's sense of smell and taste?

So, modifying the extra-cellular pH around tumors, and also tumor cells intracellular pH are lines of active enquiry in treating cancer at this time. 

So, this has shown that IER has health benefits with the need only to fast 2 days a week. Furthermore, fasting insulin and insulin resistance falls were greater in the IER group, though modest in both. If lipid levels are related to risk for dementia, then falls in LDL and total cholesterol were seen in both groups. [1] Johnson JB, Laub DR, John S.

It would be logical to assume that further entry criteria were that they shared similar diagnostic criteria, and the countries were stable enough to support such a long term study. It is absurd for Taubes to write that Keys 7 countries study was invalid as he was somehow able to predict the results 29 years in advance, and that each population would show the same relationship of diet with heart disease both between countries and also inside each study population. (Keys published in 1986 on this study [4])
