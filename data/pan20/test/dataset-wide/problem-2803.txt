If politics are to be morally just, then there can be no gap between what morals demand and what politics demand. While the individual is obligated by the moral principle, the categorical imperative, it doesn't apply to the government, which is an artificial person. Even if the government consists of only one person, the monarch acts not as an individual, but as the executive authority (ideally speaking, in theory), and as such, other demands are made to their actions. Right concerns only with external actions, that means the actions between individuals. An action is right if it can exist with everybody's freedom as a universal law (Metaphysics of Morals). While the categorical imperative demands that you apply it to your actions out of duty, right does no such thing - you can act right or not, but you must be prepared that others will coerce you, if you don't (which is impossible for internal actions). What I'm trying to show is that the actions of the government, even if it consists of only one individual, are external actions, therefore they are evaluated in aspect of legality, not of morality (in the narrower sense), and as the execution of a state, the government doesn't necessarily have to be following the categorical imperative to be executing right. We then have to ask what kind of government Kant advocated. He wrote a lot on that, and again, the Perpetual Peace gives insight (First Definitive Article): 

One possible answer to this is given by Rousseau. You can read the part on Democracy here (the following chapters are at least as relevant, so don't skip them). Little extract: 

I am stuck in a vast amount of papers concerning Marx's view of justice, written in the 70s, 80s and 90s, disputing and contradicting each other. With my current knowledge of Marx, it is sometimes difficult, sometimes impossible, to decide whose interpretation is the closest to the truth or whose speculation (as Marx didn't write a lot about his notion of justice, at least not explicitly) is more coherent. The question my professor made me answer in my term paper is "If Marx's notion of justice is not a egalitarian one, why is the absorption of surplus value by the capitalist unjust?" Now, I am not exactly sure where that idea (for he does think that Marx's theory of justice is nothing more than a egalitarian theory of justice) came from, but no matter what I read, it always seems to contradict his conclusion or the premise. Also I don't want to only explain why this is not the case, but at least give some answers on the question what a Marxist theory of justice could be. What would help immensely is a book that takes into account all previous positions (i.e. these old papers), and, if possible, reflects the latest state of research (if for no other reason, it looks better if not all my sources can be dismissed as obsolete/out of date). What I do have so far are the papers by Wood, Husami and Nielsen (as well as others) and the Oxford book by Buchanan, Marx and Justice: The Radical Critique of Liberalism. 

There is a thought that can be traced back to thinkers as Marx and Rousseau (though I am sure that this is not their root) that the human being, at a certain point in history, stops just using nature to fulfil the most basic and actual needs. Instead, humans come together and split the production that is necessary to fulfil these needs. By fulfilling basic needs, more advanced ones arise. The further the progress of needs and division of labour, the further man estranges from nature, herself and others, becoming more and more "unnatural". You can check out Marx's Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, especially the part on "Estranged Labour". For Rousseau, check the Discourse on Inequality. This thought is often used to criticise the greedy, short-sighted life nowadays. The argument, roughly, is that people would be somehow happier, if they stuck to a more "natural" life, or that it would be "better" to do that in another sense. Though not everyone subscribing to that thought is advocating a return to the Stone Age, a certain pessimism of progress is a common denominator. 

It is not just that empiricism works, and in 300 years has brought us from semaphore lines to global high speed interconnects, or that non-empiricism is a fervent breeding ground for falsehoods and mysticism; those are true and more than justify aversion to the magical, but they don't explain why that should be the case. Rather, it is that in the modern day we come further and further to irrefutable evidence that people are empirical. I will not go into detail on the evidence, but it suffices to say that if you agree to this much you also understand that there is nothing that you can do, even in theory, that a machine cannot. There is no mental magic that lets you probe beyond the veil. There is no mystical wand to wave that lets your knowledge constitute more than a map to the territory. Even if there was such a contortion of reason it would be nothing that could not in principle be done by another appropriate arrangement of gears and lasers. There is no higher level of knowledge than empirical knowledge because that is all that can be known. No matter how smart you are, Solomonoff induction is smarter. No matter how wise you are, your mind can only be causally related to causal objects. A devotion to a "higher level of truth" leads to epistemic voids like zombies or the ontological argument, arguments that seem appealing on the outset but do nought but waste time. In contrast empirical work is why we can now talk about the consciousness of brains under fully homomorphic encryption, or the measurement problem, real problems that represent huge leaps in the boundaries of philosophical discussion. Even when talking about the mind, or issues like free will, actual progress is made through empirical study. If you want to say that empirical arguments do not stand at the same height as the rest of philosophy, I would not disagree, but it is certainly not because it is lower. Until brute philosophy can make a single step forward in its own field the way Copernicus, or Turing, or Darwin, or Everett, did upon it, I hardly see much competition. 

If the story wasn't clear enough, I am saying that NA is right to treat this scenario asymmetrically. One's tools of rationality are designed precisely so that you are able to talk about areas of uncertainty. These are not a mere matter of convention, they are facts about the way the world works, and the further you stray from them the more wrong you will be. 

You have five people, and properties A, B and C. Your people respectively have properties AB, AB, BC, BC, AC. P(B|A) = 2/3 P(B|C) = 2/3 P(B|A,C) = 0 

Humans are a coherent process born of noise, formed by an incoherent filter over billions of years of jitter, and millenia of social development. At one point we figured out how to speak and to write. Some humans even told stories and wrote books that told others what to think, and a few of those even replicated wildly. Over time we have discovered systems of values, in which we encode what we have learnt. If we were conscious states in an ever-forgetful beast, we may have been born indifferent of continuity. If we were all facets of a single mind, far too large to have a coherent self but at no point separate from the rest, we may not even experience a sense of self, never mind value it. Had we neither need nor want to reproduce, it seems no stretch to believe it would have no place in our moral landscape. You ask for a universal coherent narrative on which to hang your thoughts, as if the hanger by itself would make others agree, the same way you view mathematics as true and others bound by your deductions. Yet though there is no such narrative, you can still see what is true, you want people to know what is good, you value a productive society, you see others believing the same. If God handed you the truth on a plate, you would still only take what you already believe; no offer would make you butcher children, no demand would make you stop caring about your own sadness. As long as you can feel these things you feel, you have a handle to the truth. You can wait to be passed the Mythical One True Handle so you can grab it should it compare identical to your own, or you can take the one you have already and move forward now. If you care so much about truth, look it straight in the eye and do the things that would be right if only you had a God to tell you so. More generally, on a societal level it seems very strange to pin modern zeitgeists on modern atheism. The religious past was not more productive, nor did they really love thy neighbor. Many other effects are much easier targets, like how huge global networks tend to polarize and how modern economics doesn't work like it used to. But regardless of whether this is to blame or that, it is your actions that shape society, and if you think an action is good you need not lie to yourself about why in order to take it. 

Interestingly I don't think Kant & Darwin are incompatible. In fact, I am begining to think they are actually two components of a much larger model on the development of 'success.' Darwin's idea that attributes are random is not really relevant to Kant's point. I would submit there is a slight missreasing. Darwin posits that features are random in their development or that nature does not develop features purposefully. But in a sense nature does. Features develop in a particular environment and support the continuation of both a feature and creature. Evolution selects the features which lead to reproductive success. Evoltion is the process of nature. Therefore nature is not random it is experimental. And like in the concept of brainstorming it doesn't matter where 'ideas' about a problem come from, each is put on the table and reviewed. In a sense Darwin was stating features, like ideas, appear and there source is not important in the evaluation process. The feature's reproductive success is critical. And this leads to Kant. All 'organs' fill a specific purpose. Meaning the existence of the 'organ' implies, by its existence, that it has supported reproductive success and therefore is fullfilling some purpose. Of course this ideas maybe filled with extaneous blather that will be filtered out as it's reproductive success is refined. 

Time is a physical factor and the term used to capture this concept is the word 'TIME'. You attempt to give 3 different definitions that appear to need reconcilation. I would submit these are not equal definitions of the 'concept' time which has an experiential factor. Time, is a term that captures the concept of change, and can include a measure for reference. Time as a 'consciousness' is - sorry to say - mumbo jumbo. This is mixing concepts in an imprecise way to capture some separate 'emotional state'. History is not relevant to the concept of time. History is by-product of the 'passage' of time. Edit: To expand my use of 'mumbo jumbo' I will say that 'time' is a term with a more precise or concrete definition and usage. Humans mix metaphors like 'I felt time slow down...' but here the concept of time is trying to share a feeling. Time is the anchor to hang the feeling on. Like 'cold as ice.' Consciousness is the more subjective term which includes less concrete usage and clarity. Consciousness can be used to describe the act of awakening my mind and body, or my mind only like Descartes great leap of reason driven by consciousness. Only then consciousness is used loosely in medical terminology or when describing the interaction with an animal that 'feels' human like or touching. One might say the animal felt conscious. Then you have collective conscious, higher conscious, stream-of-conscious that all use conscious in a slightly different way. So 'mumbo-jumbo', used here, is what I would call the new age practice of using more precise terms to lend legitimacy to less precise terms and ideas. [ I read a lot of philosphy so this is not my idea... but I cannot site reference ] Time is relative - is saying that time exists and that it is experienced differently. Two of your definitions capture and refine the definition of time and answer the question in the affirmative that Time is both a concept and physical. 

I think there is a point or two to pull out of the original question and supporting expansion of the question. First, you state, 'suppose there are people who like...' If we take part 1 of Kant and apply a universal rule evaluation, we could say it is good to give people what they like. So satisfying part 1 eliminates the negative of part 2. In other words you are not treating those people like 'means', your treating them like ends. Second, 'treating someone' like a mean versus and end is a rather complicated by the more imprtant fact of allowing the other party to participate in the decision. Sadly, I am not more well schooled in Kant, but I do enjoy pondering his universal rule. 

The last comment by LordScree points to the heart of the original question and the appropriate philosophical answer. Geneic changes take place randomly and support the survival of individual ( families over time ), species in varying environments. This is the common association of evolution with genes. But Richard Dawkins broke this link with his idea of a meme. Certain ideas are more effective - reproducable - and therefore fitter and reproduce. Combining these concepts, like any good philosopher, and you can concieve of 'evolution' meaning change over time; survival of the fittest meaning 'things = genes, ideas, culture, spending habits, cleaning habits' leading to reproductive success. In other words, evolution has brought humans to the point of decoupling evolution from strictly genetic change and incorporated 'self created' environments into the 'random' changes that lead to reproductive success.
