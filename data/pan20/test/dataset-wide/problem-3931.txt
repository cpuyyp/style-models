Let $h:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$ be a bounded multiplicative function with $h(p)=0$. The motivation for this question is just a general enquiry and, since I suppose it has already been considered, it seems worthwhile asking it here. 

I think these answers may be elaborated upon together. Assuming $\sum |a_n| n^{-c}$ converges, the formula to which BR refers explains the sense in which the "traditional" form of Perron's formula is a Fourier integral. By a change of variables, you have $$\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-T}^{T}\left(\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{a_n}{n^{c+iy}}\right)\frac{e^{ixy}dy}{c+iy}=e^{-cx}\sum_{n< e^x}a_n+O\left(\frac{1}{T}\sum_{1}^{\infty}\frac{|a_n|}{n^c|x-\log n|}\right)$$ (see Titchmarsch for a generalization that leads to PNT, p61-63). As $T\rightarrow\infty$, the (sharp) estimate on the r.h.s. shows that the convergence is not uniform, even though the interchange of limits on the l.h.s. is justified because the Dirichlet series converges absolutely (hence uniformly). This is obviously where the Schwartz function $\phi$ to which Ben refers justifies appeal to Fourier duality, instead of having to justify interchanging limits beyond the scope of dominated convergence. It also gives you more parameters to tweak for other purposes, if required. Yet, without introducing a further limit, the resulting formula is not Perron's so that doesn't resolve your question (but perhaps Perron's formula is obsolete?). As I understand it, this was the precisely the controversy with Riemann's statement of the Fourier expansion of the prime counting function $J(x)$ - he just appealed to Fourier duality and left it there, but that was ultimately verified by Von-Mangoldt, so perhaps there is a proof. Certainly Fourier-Stieltjes applies when the coefficients are positive, so maybe that can be deployed by someone who knows more about measure than me. 

I think the following argument settles the conjecture that $\inf |\rho_{\zeta}-\rho_{\zeta'}|=0$, assuming RH. Basically, it follows because the zeros can be arbitrarily close. Littlewood proved that $$\inf \gamma_n-\gamma_{n-1}=0.$$ On RH this implies that $$\inf \rho_n-\rho_{n-1}=0.$$ So, for every $\epsilon>0$ one can find a pair of zeros between which $$\max\{|\zeta(1/2+it)|:\gamma_{n(\epsilon)-1}<t<\gamma_{n(\epsilon)}\}=\epsilon.$$ By the theorem of Macdonald (cited in my question above) and the inverse mapping theorem, the derivative must vanish somewhere on the boundary of the closed curve enclosing $\rho_{n(\epsilon)}$ defined by the condition that $|\zeta(s)|=\epsilon$, and not inside it. By the maximum principle, as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ the modulus on and throughout the interior of the curve tends to zero, so such a curve must tend to a point as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. Since the derivative vanishes on the boundary, the result follows. EDIT. This argument is not quite right. Actually the curves described above are not necessarily closed, and therefore need not tend to a point. However, the derivative certainly vanishes on the boundary of the largest closed curve enclosing $\rho$ and on which $|\zeta(s)|=c$, and $c$ is less than or equal to $\epsilon$. The conclusion is the same, because these curves are closed. 

I prefer to proceed with a concrete example if I may. I appreciate that the answer might well be better explained with group theory, geometry and/or notions from probability theory, which I welcome. Let $\{x\}$ denote the fractional part of $x$, $(p,q)=1$ and $p\leq q$. If $n\in\mathbb{Z}_q$, then the set of $\phi(q)$ functions defined by $$f_p(n)=q\{pn/q\}$$ form the complete set of automorphisms of $\mathbb{Z}_q$. As we vary $p$ through $\mathbb{Z}_q^{\times}$, it is not apparent to me that there is prescribed order in which the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_q$ reappear, neither do I see a rule not involving the function $\{x\}$. Say we choose some large $q$, then is it the case that order in which the elements reappear exhibits some sense of randomness, and in what sense if so? 

Specifically, I find it appealing to count only squarefree numbers having $k$ prime factors, so I define $$\pi_k(x)=\#\{n\leq x: \omega(n)=k;\mu(n)\neq0 \}$$ and consider the generating functions \begin{eqnarray}f(z,x)&=&\sum_{k=0}^{m(x)}\pi_k(x) z^k\\ &=&\sum_{n\leq x}|\mu(n)|z^{\omega(n)}. \end{eqnarray} On one hand, these generating functions are polynomials in $z$ of degree $$m(x)=\max \{\omega(n): n\leq x;\mu(n)\neq 0\}\sim\log x/\log\log x.$$ On the other, they are the inverse Mellin transform of $$F(z,s)=\prod_p1+zp^{-s}=H(z,s)\zeta^z(s)$$ where $H(z,s)$ is an analytic function of $s$ for fixed $z$ which is bounded above and away from zero in any half plane $\sigma\geq\sigma_0>1/2$. 

You can't have a convolution of two functions in $L_1(0,c)$ that is not in $L_1(0,c)$, else you violate Young's inequality, or the fact that $L_1(0,c)$ (i.e. the space you refer to as $L^{+}$) is a Banach algebra under convolution, so the answer is no. I assume you are taking $a < c$ and $b < c$ (otherwise you can't work in $L_1(\mathbb{R})$ because $f_a$ and $f_b$ don't belong there). EDIT: Excuse me, Arc. I do apologize. I did not make the relevant distinction between an everywhere discontinuous function and a function defined only on a set of measure zero. I now understand the definition, so my answer is largely unhelpful. However, if you are trying to construct a function that is discontinuous on a dense set, I do get the feeling that your construction wont do because the output of your convolution is (as you would expect) better behaved than the inputs, it is locally in $L_{2-\epsilon}$ and still has only one point of discontinuity. Perhaps I am missing the point here, though. Can you explain a bit more about what you want to achieve and your approach? 

There are some qualitative theorems of Bohr, Jessen and Titchmarsh (e.g. The Theory of the Riemann zeta function, E.C. Titchmarsh, pages 306-308) proving that there is a $K=K(a,\alpha,\beta)$ such that the number of solutions to $\zeta(s)=a$, $a\neq 0$, in the rectangle $1/2<\alpha<\beta<1$, $0<t<T$, is greater than $KT$. However, there doesn't seem to be an obvious way of using the method described in Titchmarsh to determine the size of $K$ as a function of the variable $a$. I am interested in a similar quantitative question: 

For any sequence of complex numbers $(a_n)$, an application of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives $$\left|\sum_{m=1}^{n}a_m\right|\leq \sqrt {n\sum_{m=1}^{n}|a_m|^2}.$$ Putting $a_n=\mu(n)/\sqrt n$, one (trivially) finds that $$\sum_{m=1}^{n}\frac{\mu(m)}{\sqrt m}= O(\sqrt{n\log n}).$$ Is a better unconditional estimate known to hold for this sequence? In other words, is Cauchy -Schwarz the most we know about this sequence? 

The answer is no, on both counts. Certainly I was hasty to post this question based on the observation that the zeros have negative real parts and the coefficients are positive in the observed ranges. Here's a simple explanation of why: First note that $D_k(x)$ may be written as $$D_k(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}\prod_{p|n}{\alpha_p+k-1\choose \alpha_p}$$ where $\alpha_p$ is the exponent of $p$ in the canonical factorisation of $n$. $D_k(x)$ is thus a polynomial in $k$ of degree $m(x)$, so $$\sum_{k=0}^{m+1}{m+1\choose k}(-1)^kD_{m+1-k-j}(x)=0.$$ Therefore $$c(j,x)=-\sum_{k=m-j+1}^{m+1}{m+1 \choose k} (-1)^{m-k-j}D_{m+1-k-j}(x).$$ For example then, $$c(1,x)=m(x)+1-D_{-1}(x)$$ where $D_{-1}(x)=M(x)$ is Mertens' function. It follows from known results that $M(x)$ is $\Omega_{\pm}(x^{1/2})$, so $c(1,x)$ will eventually be negative of square root order. As for the zeros, by virtue of the fact that the coefficients are real and $c(0,x)=1$, we have $$c(1,x)=-\sum_{\rho:P(\rho,x)=0}\frac{1}{\rho}=-\sum_{\rho:P(\rho,x)=0}\frac{\Re{\rho}}{|\rho|^2},$$ so the same argument applies. On the other hand, from the linear relation above, it is easy to see that $c(m(x),x)=x$, so it is certainly not so obvious that $c(m(x)-1,x)$, $c(m(x)-2,x)$, etc, will also change sign eventually. These questions are tied up with the Riemann hypothesis. 

Let $D(s)$ be a Dirichlet series with abscissa of convergence $\sigma_c=\sigma_a$. Does it follow that the Dirichlet series defined by $P(s)=D(s)\bar D(\bar s)$ has the same abscissa of convergence? In light of Noam D. Elkies answer below, I would like to know about conditions on the coefficients that also lead to the divergence of the square? What if the coefficients are completely multiplicative? 

In other words, the rate of approach of $(Ms,b_n)\rightarrow \pi/2$ is completely determined if $s$ has property $P$, and this rate is optimal. My questions are as follows: 

A special case of a well known result of Ingham is that $$\sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n+1)=\frac{6}{\pi^2}x(\log x)^2+O(x\log x)$$ where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Ingham's results, which are arrived at by a long but elementary calculation, may be combined with a further long and non-elementary (i.e. involving some complex analysis) calculation, but which does not use any properties of non-principal characters or $L$-functions, to arrive at the conclusion that the following average over all $q$ less than $x $ of all non-principal character sums: $$\frac{1}{x}\sum_{q\leq x}\frac{1}{\phi(q)}\sum_{\chi\neq \chi_0}\left(\sum_{n\leq x}\chi(n)d(n)\right)=O(\log x).$$ In fact, it can be shown that this statement is also sufficient for the truth of Ingham's result. It seems to me that statements like this would have more direct proofs, perhaps analytical using known or hypothetical properties of $L^2(s,\chi)$, or perhaps using properties of character sums. Is this so? 

Let $\rho$ denote a non-trivial zero of $\zeta(s)$ and $l_n(\rho)$ the $n$th coefficient in the Laurent expansion of $1/\zeta(s)$ about $\rho$. For example, if the pole is simple then we have $l_{-1}(\rho)=1/\zeta'(\rho)$. My motivation is to understand the asymptotics of these sequences, the reasons for which I will briefly explain: Firstly, on intuitive grounds, these sequences encode the radii of convergence of the expansions at each $\rho$ and thus the vertical distribution of poles. However, I believe that a lot more can be said in connection with the horizontal distribution of zeros by considering the sequence $s:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, defined by $$s(n)=\sum_{\rho}\frac{l_{n}(1-\rho)}{\rho\zeta'(\rho)},$$ assuming all the poles are simple (one would have to modify $s(n)$ otherwise). The quantity $l$ in $$\frac{1}{l}=\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\sqrt[n]{|s(n)|}$$(if it exists) is the radius of convergence of a certain power series, and measures twice the horizontal distance from the critical line to a zero of $\zeta(s)$ off the line, if any exist. Thus, establishing that $l>0$ establishes that there is a strip of non-zero width about the critical line containing no zeros off the line, and establishing that $l\geq 1$ is the Riemann Hypothesis. One might like to think of this as attacking the strip from the inside, rather than out. I would be very interested to know if anything is known about $l_n(\rho)$, or indeed $s(n)$, and where I can find the details if so? If anyone would like me to explain how this series is derived, I will happily do so. Thanks!
