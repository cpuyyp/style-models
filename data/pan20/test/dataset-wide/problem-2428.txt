The lute (vina) is a stringed musical instrument similar to a cello, that you can play by plucking. From it comes music. The different parts of the lute are like the five aggregates. Music is like the self. One might think that the music is located somewhere in the lute or pervades the lute. However, if you break it apart and burn it down completely, music cannot be found. Why? It's because music arises dependent on the inter-working of the different parts of the lute. Similarly, the self arises dependent on the inter-working of the five aggregates. If you break it apart and burn it down completely, you won't find a self or soul anywhere. And that is a very nice and simple way to think about anatta. 

Almost all religions says give a part of money to god and that will be honoured after death. What is Buddhism's stand on that? Buddhism encourages Dana, the practice of giving. You can read the essay, Dana: The Practice of Giving for details. Here, giving is not to the gods, but to monks, guests, travellers, the sick and the needy. The manner and attitude of giving is very important. The essay will tell you much more. There is a whole sutta for this, the Dana Sutta. I quote from it here: 

From your quote, it sounds like the lack of uplifted energy is the hindrance of sloth and torpor, one of the five hindrances to practice. To quote Ajahn Brahmavamso: 

In Theravada, there is faith and preferably verified confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. One who has faith is called a faith follower. There is faith, but there is no (Hindu style of) devotion in Theravada. There is however, reverence in Theravada Buddhism for example, through the act of prostration, as pointed out by ChrisW in the comments. In Mahayana, some schools like Pure Land Buddhism, have devotion to Avalokiteshvara or Amitabha Buddha, with mantras to chant. There is a belief that one can be reborn in the Pure Land, the realm where the Amitabha Buddha resides, in order to continue the journey towards Buddhahood, with the guidance of Amitabha Buddha. The Hindu style of devotion (bhakti) involve chanting the deity's names, remembering the deity's forms and glories, as well as having a close personal relationship with the deity. There are similar types of devotions in the Abrahamic religions. This is not found in Theravada Buddhism which does not have a Supreme God. Also in Theravada, the Buddha is no longer reborn after Nirvana. I am not sure if the Mahayana devotion in certains schools like Pure Land Buddhism is the same as the Hindu style of devotion. 

To all your questions, the answer is to respond with the mindfulness of Metta as outlined in the Karaniya Metta Sutta. There's more in Metta Sutta. If you are mindful at all waking times with Metta, then the benefits include sleeping and waking in comfort, as well as becoming dear to other human beings. Although these Suttas do not describe this detail, I believe that by this practice, you will begin to understand the deep-seated true motives of people who wish to do harm to others. For e.g. they may crave attention or praise, or they may want to hold on to their power or position, or they have greed or envy. When you practise Metta, you don't set your self up as the victim or the receiving end of these people. Instead, with your mind not preoccupied with fighting or reacting back, it has the space to understand the true motives of people and deal with it in such a way that it will cease or be avoided. And for those people, without a receptive victim to attack, they may cease or take their harmful tendencies elsewhere. From the Karaniya Metta Sutta: 

Buddhist scriptures are not as sacrosanct as in the way the Quran is where the Quran is divinely guaranteed to be incorruptible till the end of time and cannot be questioned. However, at the same time, there is a distinction between what is Buddhavacana (words of the Buddha) and what isn't. The Buddha's own stand on this matter is reflected in the Kalama Sutta where he says about discerning teachings: 

The third concept usually mistaken for Brahman is the concept of the Eternal Buddha. This comes from the notion that the Buddha's dharmakaya or Dharma Body is Eternal. This does not mean that the Buddha is an eternal being or entity. Rather, it means that the Buddha's teachings (called the Dharma or Dhamma) is eternal. This originates from the Vakkali Sutta where the Buddha told Vakkali: 

Here's what I have learned since asking this question ... Some Theravadins accuse Mahayana Buddhism of eternalism or introducing God or Soul into Buddhism, where there is none. Interestingly, some Hindu scholars have tried to use concepts that seem like eternalism in Mahayana Buddhism, to say that Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism is the same, and therefore, Buddhism is just a sect of Hinduism. In his book "Indian Philosophy: A Critical Survey" on page 63, Professor Chandradhar Sharma wrote about Mahayana Buddhism: 

@Lanka answered from the perspective of the Theravada tradition. From the Mahayana and Vajrayana perspective, you can find the answer here from Lama Zopa Rinpoche: 

The Buddha quote from the sutta says that anyone with some passion, aversion or delusion, reinforces it by watching the actor's performance. The actor too is intoxicated with emotions due to getting into character to play the role. And by acting out the role on stage, the actor has the intention of getting the audience to experience the same emotions. This intention is karma. So, this is a question about Right Livelihood. The butcher had the intention and actions to take the life of the animals he slaughtered. And in this case, the actor had the intention and actions to reinforce emotions in the audience that are filled with passion, aversion or delusion. So, it stands to reason that such an acting career is not following Right Livelihood. This surprises me too, but it makes sense. However, if the acting role results in reinforcement of thoughts and emotions that are conducive to the dhamma, then that can't be wrong in any way, can it? 

In the YouTube video entitled "Characteristics of a Sotapanna", Ven. Dhammavuddho Mahathera stated (with some paraphrasing): 

You can also find this in AN 11.11, AN 11.12, AN 5.179, AN 10.92 and AN 3.70. From this essay by Ajahn Sumedo: 

But does this cross into other lifetimes? From the Nakhasikha Sutta, Samudda Sutta and Pokkharani Sutta: 

Please see this answer about a video by Yuttadhammo Bhikkhu on addiction to pornography and addiction in general. That answer also states: 

My first two suggestions are similar to others. Firstly, avoid leaving exposed food or food crumbs, that might attract insects or rodents. Secondly, use agents that repel rather than kill insects or rodents. Please also consider the safety of your pets and children too. For e.g. I have successfully used powdered white pepper to repel ants. Ants lose their scent of the trail when they encounter pepper. Pepper is also safe for your pets and children. Pepper is organic too. Thirdly, in many countries, if you run a restaurant, you could get shut down if there is an infestation of rats or cockroaches. So, what do you do when all else fails? You can try rat traps. Then release the rats elsewhere. But that might be against the law too, if you release them in populated areas. So, the only remaining way to comply with the law, is to use methods that kill the rats or cockroaches. Fourthly, what if you really need to kill the pests in order to prevent certain diseases that affect humans? For e.g. in countries where dengue or malaria is endemic, they need to control the breeding of mosquitoes and, repel and kill mosquitoes by fogging. And in some places, the urine of rats can cause leptospirosis. So, in these cases, the only way left is to kill the mosquitoes and rats. In my opinion, if the intention is to comply with the law and/or prevent human diseases, then it is perfectly alright. Remember the "middle way" in all things. Please also see this answer. 

Should you then blame yourself instead? Of course not. Instead, we should strive to seek a correct understanding based on the teachings. 

The term dhamma has multiple meanings in Buddhism. Dhamma is defined in the accesstoinsight.org glossary page as: 

Later, householder Nakulapita got more detailed advice from Ven. Sariputta the Arahant, elaborating the Buddha's advice: 

Despite this, SN25 does have a provision for "faith followers" to meet a good end simply by having conviction and belief in the teachings of the Buddha, because it would lead them down the right track. 

And the essay continues to explain how deep reflection on kammic retribution leads to development of equanimity: 

In the Vitakkasanthana Sutta, we find that unskillful thoughts "imbued with desire, aversion, or delusion" have to be removed. In the Vina Sutta: 

It means that both pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow are part of suffering (dukkha). Pain causes suffering when you encounter it. Pleasure causes suffering when you lose it or if you're denied it. From SN56.11: 

Ananda Sutta (SN22.83) paraphrased here, tells that the self ("I am") is also very natural, as long as one clings to the five aggregates. 

A similar question was asked here on History Stack Exchange. There also appears to be some info here and here. 

Providing the services of a medical practitioner or pharmacist to lay people is not allowed for monks according to DN2: 

The Buddha did teach emptiness in the Pali Suttas, but it is restricted to the nature of the self i.e. all phenomena is empty of a self (see Shunya Sutta). The Buddha did not comment on the nature of all non-sentient things like the universe, besides noting them as being conditioned, compounded and impermanent. The Buddha was not interested in commenting on the nature or origin of the universe, because he considered it to be unimportant to the path to liberation from suffering - see the Parable of the Poisoned Arrow (from MN63). The Buddha was not interested in metaphysical speculations (also see Simsapa Sutta). This is also the stand of Theravada Buddhism today. While the Buddha (of the Pali Suttas) stopped at describing the "middle way" (between eternalism and annihilationism) and emptiness with respect to the nature of the self, Mahayana philosopher Nagarjuna expanded these concepts to cover the nature of the universe and all reality. Rather than the annihilationism that nothing exists or the eternalism that something exists eternally, Nagarjuna taught the "middle way" that all phenomena is empty of its own "inherent existence" or "substance" or "essence" (what he called svabhāva). If nothing has inherent substance, then nothing can depend on something else for substance, so there is no other inherent substance (para-bhāva). A key concept of Madhyamaka is that even this emptiness is empty i.e. this emptiness does not have its own inherent substance. This means that there is no transcendental reality beyond phenomenal reality. This is what is implied by ultimate reality not being absolute reality. A very nice and simplified explanation of the Madhyamaka emptiness can be found in Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh's writing, "The Fullness of Emptiness". I quote some parts of it below: 

The knowledge of kamma (cause and effect due to volition) leads to us having the courage to build up wholesome and skillful thoughts and actions. From Thanissaro Bhikkhu's essay "Freedom from Fear": 

In the Janussonin Sutta, the Buddha states that food offerings to the dead cannot reach them if they are reborn in hell, as animal, as human or as devas (heavanly beings). However, food offerings to the dead would reach them or other ancestors who are born as hungry ghosts or petas. Those who offer this, would not go unrewarded for their generosity, according to the sutta. This appears to be the practice described in the Tirokudda Kanda. Ven. Nanda Mahathera writes here: 

Where there is a group of people, there will be politics and organizational dynamics. This should be no different with the Sangha. For example, monks trying to cause dissent or schism, monks who disobey instructions, monks trying to gain power over others, monks who are envious of others, monks trying to get the attention of the Buddha or their abbot etc. How did the Buddha handle such situations in his time? How are such situations handled within the Sangha today? 

The same sutta has plenty more advice for the lay life. In the Maha-vacchagottasutta, the Buddha tells that there have indeed been lay male and female followers of his who had become enlightened. So, that's not impossible. Also see this answer. 

For lay persons and others, the Buddha prescribed the minimum set of training rules, which is the five precepts. These are not commandments or prohibitions. Rather, they are training rules. It is up to you whether to undertake the prescribed training or not. For example, you may not be forced to join the army. But if you join the army voluntarily, you would have to observe the army's training rules. There's a purpose to those training rules, towards achieving the goals of the army. Similarly, you are not forced to practise Buddhism. If you choose to do so, the minimum training rules would be the five precepts, towards achieving the goals of Buddhism. Whether you practise the five precepts or not, you are still subject to cause and effect. No matter what you choose to believe or practise, there is still cause and effect in this world and in this life. To me, the phrase "at the dissolution of the body after death, a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly world" clearly refers to rebirth. But as a secular Buddhist or even non-Buddhist, you may interpret it as a metaphorical mental reappearance from moment to moment, into another state of mind. Regardless of how you interpret that, cause and effect definitely affects you in this life itself. It's up to you to choose to accept or reject the voluntary training rules of the five precepts, towards the Buddhist goal of ending suffering.
