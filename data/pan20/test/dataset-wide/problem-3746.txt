In the case of a shedding vertex $v$, $\operatorname{reg} I(G) = \max \{ \operatorname{reg} I(G \setminus N[v]) + 1, \operatorname{reg} I(G\setminus v) \}$, by a theorem of myself and Tài Hà. So your inequality is true. See Theorem 1.5 of the following. Hà, Huy Tài; Woodroofe, Russ, Results on the regularity of square-free monomial ideals, Adv. Appl. Math. 58, 21-36 (2014). ZBL1299.13017. 

As far as Question 1 goes, I guess that if I restricted the situation further, I could compute the Chevallay group. But I'd like to be able to deal with an arbitrary (finite) Lie algebra. 

As is alluded to in the article linked in the previous answer, the Dehn-Sommerville equations are a powerful generalization of the Euler-Poincare formula for a homology sphere. These say that, for a homology $d$-sphere, the relation $h_i = h_{d-i}$ holds for every $i \in {0,\dots, d}$. This simple $h$-vector relation can be expanded out into a rather more complicated (but equivalent) relation on the $f$-vector. In particular, the relation $h_d = h_0$ recovers the Euler-Poincare formula. There's a nice Wikipedia article on the Dehn-Sommerville equations. In particular, you can look here if you want to see the $f$-vector formulation of the equations. The Wikipedia article only mentions simplicial polytopes. If you want a reference for the statement on homology spheres, see the Kalai article (informally), or, in somewhat different language, Stanley's book Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra. 

(Building on Goldstern's comment:) If fields are ok, (and if you allow infinite algebras -- see comment by Mariano Suárez-Alvarez below) then the distributivity certainly does not hold. Take e.g. a finite degree extension $F$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ with Galois group $G$. Subalgebras of $F$ are subfields, by undergraduate field theory, so the subalgebra lattice over $\mathbb{Q}$ is the field extension lattice of $F:\mathbb{Q}$. (I'm assuming that you're taking all your algebras over a fixed field, here $\mathbb{Q}$.) By the Galois correspondence, the field extension lattice is anti-isomorphic to the subgroup lattice of the Galois group. And subgroup lattices certainly need not be distributive. Indeed, by a theorem of Ore, the subgroup lattice $L(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is distributive iff $G$ is cyclic. 

The first open case is $PSL_2(8)$, which has order $504 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7$, and maximal subgroups with indices 9, 28, and 36. Since every subgroup satisfies $P(*,*)$, the possible places where $PSL_2(8)$ could fail $P(*,*)$ are $P(12, 42)$ and $P(21, 24)$. 

One more comment: When I'm explaining discrete Morse Theory shortly to non-geometric combinatorics people, I explain homology as a way to do linear-algebraic matchings in a way that is often helpful to inclusion-exclusion problems. The discrete Morse matchings go back and use plain old matchings to do the linear-algebraic matching. (Of course, discrete Morse matchings also give a stronger homotopy equivalence statement, which is pleasing.) 

I think that the answer to your question ought to be "not always". There are examples of non-shellable balls and spheres. A very readable account of these, together with some of the history, can be found at this blog entry. Now if you take the face lattice of a sphere, that is an Eulerian lattice. Passing from a complex $\Delta$ to the order complex of the face lattice of $\Delta$ yields the barycentric subdivision of $\Delta$. So to find a negative answer to your question, find a non-shellable sphere whose barycentric subdivision also fails to be shellable. The construction of such spheres is briefly discussed in this paper. There is likely a source somewhere that constructs such a sphere more explicitly. Update: Also, the answer to your pre-question is "yes". Indeed, the barycentric subdivision of any shellable complex is vertex-decomposable, a somewhat stronger property. 

A complex that is shellable usually has lots of shellings, and it's often quick to find them by recursively trying to extend a partial shelling. The above-mentioned answer mentions some ways that this can be made more efficient. A (pure) complex that is not shellable often has a negative component in its $h$-vector, a certain re-encoding of the $f$-vector. See $URL$ For non-pure complexes, you can check the so-called $h$-triangle -- see Björner and Wachs, "Shellable nonpure complexes and posets I". Since shellable complexes (more generally sequentially Cohen-Macaulay complexes) have positive $h$-triangles, this gives a quick way of eliminating some complexes that are not shellable. 

Sperner's Lemma. Let me start by talking through the implications for topology of Sperner's Lemma. The point is a map $S^1 \rightarrow S^1$ is null-homotopic exactly if it extends to a map $D^1 \rightarrow S^1$. Then the 3 coloring of Sperner's Lemma gives a map from the boundary of the triangulated triangle, to the boundary of a triangle (with the vertices corresponding to the three colors). The condition on the coloring amounts to requiring the map to be degree 1. Since a map from a simplicial disc to a triangle maps only to its boundary if and only if no 2-simplex maps to the entire triangle, the conclusion follows. Null-homotopic maps. Now, as Vidit Nanda has noted, a map from $S^3 \rightarrow S^2$ is similarly null-homotopic if and only if it extends to a map $D^4 \rightarrow S^2$. Thus, to show a simplicial map $f$ from the boundary of a triangulated 4-simplex $\Delta$ to the boundary of a tetrahedron is not null-homotopic, it suffices to show that some 3-simplex $\sigma$ in $\Delta$ is "rainbow" -- that is, that the 4 vertices of $\sigma$ map to the 4 vertices of the tetrahedron. (Rainbow being a good word if you think of the 4 vertices as being named Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow.) The Hopf invariant. At this point, I can answer Jim's question: Yes, there exists a combinatorial analogue of Sperner's Lemma showing that a map with Hopf invariant 1 is not null-homotopic. The definition of simplicial cohomology is purely combinatorial, and the above allows us to translate "null-homotopic" into combinatorics. There surely exists a (possibly complicated) encoding of "Hopf invariant 1" into statements about colors. Towards a concrete answer According to P Hilton's "An introduction to homotopy theory" Chapter 6, we can define the Hopf invariant for $f:S^3 -> S^2$ as follows: take a point $x$ of $S^2$. The inverse image of $x$ under $f$ is a (homology 1-) cycle $C$, and so there is a homology 2-chain $D$ which has $C$ as its boundary. Since $f$ collapses the boundary of $D$ (and leaves the rest alone), we get that $f(D)$ is a homology 2-cycle in $S^2$. If $f(D)$ is the fundamental cycle, then we say $f$ has Hopf invariant 1. Thus, a map has Hopf invariant 1 if we can find $D$ and $C$ as above such that the induced map from $D/C \rightarrow S^2$ has degree 1. Hilton's formulation of the Hopf invariant however does seem to be somewhat more tractable to turning into a combinatorial condition than the standard one from e.g. Wikipedia -- Hilton's is easier to work with simplicially! Incidentally, Hilton seems to say that his formulation is closer than the standard to Hopf's original statements. Let me try to translate Hopf-invariant-one into a coloring condition: A theorem: Let $f$ be a 4-coloring of the vertices of a triangulated 5-simplex $\Delta$, such that there is a subcomplex $D \subseteq \partial \Delta$ which is a triangulated polygon (i.e., 2-disc) satisfying the following coloring properties: i) The boundary of $D$ is monochromatic (say, Red), ii) No interior vertices of $D$ are colored Red, and iii) The subcomplex of $D$ induced by the interior vertices of $D$ satisfies the Sperner condition on Green, Blue, and Yellow -- that is, there are boundary vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3$ colored Green, Blue, and Yellow, such that the outside path from $v_1$ to $v_2$ has all vertices Green or Blue, etc. Then $\Delta$ has a rainbow (Red-Green-Blue-Yellow) simplex. An illustration of the conditions on $D$ follows: 

UPDATE: The conjecture is true for all finite solvable groups. Proof: Let $G$ be a solvable group. Then $G$ has a normal subgroup $N$ of prime index, and some element of prime-power order $g \notin N$. Since $N$ is maximal in $G$, we have $\langle g,N \rangle = G$, and since $N$ is normal we have $\langle g,N \rangle = \langle g \rangle N$. Then by Dedekind's identity, we get that $\langle g \rangle (H \cap N) = H \cap G = H$ for any $H$ containing $\langle g \rangle$. The last tells us that the map from the interval $[\langle g \rangle,G] \rightarrow [1,N]$ given by $H \mapsto H \cap N$ is an injection. Since $N$ doesn't contain $g$, we get the conjectured statement. $\square$ Indeed, the above works whenever $G$ has a maximal normal subgroup of prime index. (E.g., for symmetric groups.) (Thanks to John Shareshian for several useful comments and discussion.) 

I brought this thread to the attention of Eran Nevo, who gave some more references, and pointed out that the answer to the converse of your question (2) is "no". In his thesis, which I gave the arXiv link to above, and in the paper version of this "Higher minors and Van Kampen's obstruction", Nevo defines a strongly edge decomposable sphere to be a sphere which can be reduced to the simplex by edge contractions. He shows that in any PL-manifold (in any dimension), an edge is contractible if and only if it satisfies the link condition. Then Satoshi Murai in "Algebraic shifting of strongly edge decomposable spheres" shows that any squeezed sphere is strongly edge decomposable. (Murai also has an earlier paper which is related, "Generic initial ideals and squeezed spheres".) Since there are more squeezed $d$-spheres than polytopes for $d \geq 5$, there are non-polytopal spheres where an edge contraction leaves a polytopal sphere. Though I didn't see $d=4$ settled explicitly one way or the other in the papers I looked at, I suspect that there are non-polytopal squeezed 4-spheres as well (and probably this is known). Every squeezed $3$-sphere is polytopal. Another paper which is somewhat relevant is Babson and Nevo "Lefschetz properties and basic constructions on simplicial spheres". I also thought a bit about the forward direction of your question (2). If $vw$ is a contractible edge in the boundary of the convex hull of $V$, it looks plausible to me that the edge contraction should correspond to passing to (boundary of) the convex hull of $V \setminus \lbrace v,w \rbrace \cup x$, where $x$ is a point on $vw$. For as you 'slide' $v$ and $w$ together, the link condition seems to prevent new faces from being created. (Obviously, there is a lot to be checked with this idea!) 

Is there any possibility that this is right, and the group of inner automorphisms of $sl(3,3)$ really has order 9285337152? If so, the group seems like it must be too big to be interesting -- what should I be computing instead? Is there a good place to read about inner automorphisms and similar topics for finite Lie algebras? (Preferably something on the textbook level, or otherwise aimed at nonexperts.)
