Personally, I would argue that anyone who ponders the nature of the universe and the nature of the human condition not only qualifies as a philosopher but is an authority no more or less reliable than anyone else in the field of philosophy. Or to quote Terrence McKenna: 

So basically, everyone qualifies as a philosopher and even an authority in philosophy, but great philosophers are nevetheless few and far between, simply because geniuses are few and far between. Neither having a degree in philosophy nor having studied the writings of classic Greco-Roman philosophers makes someone a better philosopher. 

This would actually be a correct assumption of being born into money automatically results to being rich. However, it doesn't. You can be born into money and not being rich. Suppose that you are not rich. Does that mean that you were not born into money? Well, no. Maybe you were born into money, but you lost it all with bad investments or gambling. Or does that mean that you don't have the right connections? Well, no. Maybe you have the right connections, but you prefer to be an employee rather than starting your own business. etc. etc. So if B is caused by A, the lack of B does not imply a lack of A per se, because there might actually be a C that prevents A from leading to B... or a C + D + E... Real life is far, far, far more complex than every single event being directly caused by an individual previous event or prevented by the lack of an individual previous event. Real life is multi-dimensional, and everything that happens is literally the consequence of an intricate convergence trillions upon trillions of other events that happened before it and that are all entangled and entwined with each other! I don't think the issue here is a logical fallacy, but merely an oversimplification on how causality works! 

Interestingly, the Big Bang theory (introduced by Belgian priest Georges Lema√Ætre in 1927) is questioned by physicists today, as new studies increasingly confirm the ancient notion that time is eternal 

As a Discordian, I would argue that the very distinction between order and chaos is by definition subjective and mostly arbitrary : 

In short, Kaczynski claims that civilization is the disease and not the cure. "Industrial Society and its Future" has been influential among radical movements that emphasize either Radical Environmentalism, Neo-Luddite notions of Tribalism or a combination of both (which includes but is not exclusive to Anarcho-Primitivists, Green Anarchists, Post-Left Anarchists, National-Anarchists and Neotribalists). "Industrial Society and its Future" is barely known outside of these movements, however, which makes it rather difficult to find sources that approach Kaczinski's manifesto in a critical manner. So, basically, what I'm asking for is this : If we ignore the obvious moral implications of his killing spree and focus exclusively on the theory Kaczynski expressed in his "Industrial Society and its Future", can you point out any flaws in this theory and/or reference quality sources that attempt to expose those flaws?! (click me for the unabridged text of "Industrial Society and its Future") 

If we're to use other animals as an example of what comes natural for humans, there's no way to generalize fatherhood across different species. Among animals, there are many fatherhood strategies, with some males not caring at all about their offspring, while others (like the alligator pipefish or the marsupial frog) going as far as carrying the offspring instead of the mother. As such, it's better to restrict our investigation to those species closest to humans : chimps and bonobos : 

For an in depth analysis of the relationship between perception, language and objective reality, I can highly recommend Olga Bogdashina's Autism and the Edges of the Known World: Sensitivities, Language and Constructed Reality. In this impressive study, mss Bogdashina compares the way different languages correlate with different perceptions in different cultures as well as how Autistic people and "neurotypical" people with the same cultural background differ in their application of language to exchange their perception of the objective reality and culture they share. 

Philosophers tend to be divided on the answer to that question, because they are divided on another, more fundamental question : 

While belief is a mental state, knowledge is not. To really know something requires both that you believe in something and that whatever you believe in is truthful. While belief is something that you are aware of yourself and that can be verified just by looking inward (without any external sources of verification), verifying the truthfulness of that something you believe in requires external information. Consider the notion that extraterrestrial aliens have come to earth and abducted humans several times in the past. You may or not believe that notion and you can verify that (dis)belief just by looking inward. However, the knowledge of whether extraterrestrial aliens have indeed come to earth and done those things cannot be verified by looking inward. While you may think you are 100% certain that that statement is either true or false, that being truthful knowledge requires external verification. You can be 100% truthful in expressing what you believe and still be 100% inaccurate in expressing what is true. 

Thus, my approach deals with objective facts, not subjective morality. IMO, this is the only meaningful approach, for the very reasons you pointed out yourself : you need objective standards for "right" and "wrong" to be meaningful concepts. 

The lines we draw between "animate" and "inanimate" or between "conscious" and "not conscious" are entirely arbitrary. At this stage of human development, we simply don't know enough about the very nature of life and consciousness to make such distinctions in a non-arbitrary fashion. See also my answer to Does consciousness depend on our five senses? where I address how consciousness can be modeled in a layered fashion, like a Matryoshka doll. The lowers layer of consciousness would be the smallest particles imaginable and the highest layer of consciousness would be the universe itself. Individual humans and human collectives would both be somewhere at the intermediate level, along with all other life on this planet. It is mostly a mixture of genetic and cultural prejudices that makes us empathize more with some forms of consciousness and less with others. That's why abortion is sacrilege in some cultures and normal in others... or why some people eat cats while others treat them like children. 

The logical conclusion of propositions (1) and (2) would be that Sven has a mustache. Now, Sven indeed does happen to have a mustache. However, not all men have mustaches. In this example, proposition (2) is wrong, yet the conclusion based on both propositions happens to be correct. 

Others would argue that faith and reason are complementary. They would argue that faith can (and should) be used wherever reason does not provide us with answers : 

Scientists have proven that there is an objective reality each and every one of us plays a part in, but they have also proven that our perception of that objective reality is subjective and flawed in many ways. Currently, there is growing evidence that our universe is a giant hologram. Does that mean that our universe isn't real? Or should we reassess what it means to be real? Personally, I would argue for the latter, as our objective reality is the only reasonable reference we have for what constitutes as real or not.
