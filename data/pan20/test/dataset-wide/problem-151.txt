For some reason I watch this snake bot quest line with interest... and finally I thing I found its lethal weakness: heat. Airborne Laser Or frome space... anyway, while a short shot will do nothing, you could melt away any form of armor with ease if you manage to heat it up. Even better - microwave it. No need for any optical energy loss, just keep Terawatts of microwaves firing upon it. After you didn't mention a Faraday's cage, this will roast any electronics inside... buuuut at least tungsten and uranium are metals, so it will shield the interns. And they are fine heat conductors and heat capacitors, if I recall right. Your outer hull does have a melting point of about 3000 Kelvin, that next layer might come around 3500 Kelvin... that are peanuts for a laser. To be honest, you would need to do this for a long time, and the "eat a tsar" from Murphy is probably the faster solution, but it would be a pain in the ass getting that bomb inside it. Even more - it does not need to eat anything, just keep on moving to destroy something. So I recommend a combined action: insert a fusion power plant inside a 747, and let it aim for the railguns, wait for snakes maintenance stop, keep on heating it up until something starts glowing red, than drop that cute nuke at this location. Hole in the wall. Now you can melt anything inside. That does sound easy in theory... most difficult part would be creating a laser / maser that is powerful enough. EMP So while I'm unsure what a dozend meter of superheavy metals can do against an emp, it something you could try at least and look whats happening. At least the railguns will provide a point of attack for any form of em shock therapy... EDIT: Ou, someone did mention the emp-idea while I was typing already. credits for him if this is the solution. 

Sci-fi setting where cargo is being shipped to colony worlds. If a spaceship has to land and take off again, that costs a lot of money, so that mode of transport is reserved for people and urgent, high-value cargo; the plan is to get bulk cargo the last lousy few hundred kilometers in drop capsules, which aerobrake, parachute, splash into the ocean and get towed to shore by boat. The maximum speed at which a capsule will hit atmosphere is 5 kilometers per second. (This is very hypersonic, but still slower than standard orbital velocity.) Their size will be on the order of a few meters, and they will be made of ordinary materials like steel and composites. What shape should the capsules be? Aerodynamic considerations suggest they should be round, perhaps ideally the quasi-teardrop shape (lens with short trailing cone) of the early space capsules. On the other hand, that's a terrible shape for efficient packing aboard a freighter. Efficient packing would much prefer rectangular boxes like today's cargo containers. But sharp corners would probably melt when the capsule hits atmosphere. Would it be viable to at least compromise on something like a cylinder shape? 

Good Day, Thinking about this, you could look up what real monks did in their... freetime (when they did not ora, but labora) When your civilization doesn't know the... uh, whats the name... letter press (?), than your monks could copy books the old way. Seriously, thats a task that takes real long time if you want your books to look pretty. In Germany something that does like a prime task for (male) monks seems to be brewing beer. There are dozens or monastery - breweries that still sell beer, and this isn't just a phenomena from Germany... all that once was holy roman empire or a hold of the knights from the german order (black cross at white ground) seems to embrace the idea of delegating the beer-production to some kind of monasteries. At least in the past. They could take care of childs... well... uhm... how does an undead population make kids? Take them from other civilizations graveyards? Anyway, schooling siblings might something they could do. Some monks actually did pretty well when researching stuff. At all, they did have the time for studies other might find to time-consuming. Mostly they discovered stuff that was themed around healing others. What plant does cure what disease. But whats a disease for an undead? Coming back to life? Well, to cure this not much research is necessary after all... And taking a look to the far east, you could have your undead lerning how to maximize the power of their bodies. They wont feel any pain maybe, so its time to develop Bone-Fu, which is performed by using your other monks loose limbs and... ehm... no. Its better I do not plot more about this topic... I wonder if someone did answer the same stuff while I was typing this. 

A setting where we still have the rest of our technology, but for reasons - alien space bats, basically - there are no longer any stable orbits around Earth with an altitude higher than about 1000 km. Could we build a replacement GPS based on satellites in low orbit? I know the existing system is based on geosynchronous orbit, but is that an absolutely necessary quality of any such system, or would using LEO just make the engineering more expensive? 

In a futuristic setting where people are worried about enemy spacecraft doing things like dropping bombs from orbit, and are building ground-based lasers to shoot back, Given that such weapons have the disadvantage of having to shoot up through atmosphere (putting them on high ground ~2 km helps a bit, but only a bit), What is the optimum wavelength to minimize absorption and scattering by air (and preferably by clouds)? It's definitely going to be some way into the infrared, but what exact wavelength would be best? 

While still not totally clear if the question ask for an inclined orbit or an inclined rotation, I will offer my two bits for both questions possible. Orbit First, Pluto for example - while no one yet was able to reconstruct what happened after all as far as I know - can have several major options to get his orbit after all. I can think of the possibility that he didn't start his carrier as a planet(like object) after all, but was a giant moon of one of our gas giants for some time, until... good question. But if he had a huge altitude every time his parent planet hat its closest approach to another gas giant, a tiny momentum of pull might have happened. I have to admin that this scenario is pretty unlikely, but still... At one point he might just got the notch to make him escape his parent planet after all and went off for adventures of his own. Maybe he would dwell around between Jupiter and Saturn for some time, until he get a random gravity assist (break or accelerate) that would change his orbit once more. And because its unlikely that he went in exactly at the same plane as the pushing random gas giant, he got a free of charge lift away from the planets plane after all. A wild theory, I know. Other options were named here already: a "small" celestial body like Pluto could get thrown off course by an impact, especially if this happens at his descending or ascending node (where its effect would be most effective). He could have met a rouge planet aeons ago, that stole some orbital speed away so orbit became eccentric and/or inclined. And last but not least, it could be a huge alien structure hauled to this place a long time ago; as soon as it detects ftl travel from earth, it will call in a huge artillery strike at this location because the aliens don't want us fooling around in that peaceful galaxy. Rotation To be honest, I can't offer much to this topic. Still, a huge impact may have the ability to add a minor vector to the spin, but that wont work with huge planets. Further what I will call "bowling ball effect" because I cant recall the scientific name may. A minor or major spot of heavy whatever located way outside the rotational center will cause some... well, it wont rotate as good as before. Can be supplied by random impact encounters. Now add some moons and a non circular spin and... well, maybe not. For Uranus I can offer a theory someone who claimed to be studying astronomy told me years ago. After all, even we on earth are afraid that our magnet field will shift some day. Some say this is caused by the core who think it might be a good time to change its rotation. However, because we are sitting on a pile of heavy molten stone and metal, the magnetic field alone wont be enough to have a huge impact on rotation direction. BUT if you are a piece of gas (in different forms), sudden change of the cores rotation direction may be able to pull the light stuff at the outside hard enough to make it copy your new way of spinning, just by applying magnetic forces. Chances are good that below the surface metallic hydrogen still is spinning the way it did some aeons ago. But this should cause atmospheric trouble beyond imagination... Up to this day I never heard this last theory again, so use with caution. So... happy planet spinning. Oh, you might use the universal sandbox to find out if the "from moon to planetoid with shitty orbit" explanation from me can be true; I do no have this toy sadly. 

I got to thinking a simple throwaway thought on this video where this dude flushes mercury in a toilet (in a closed loop) For one thing, it's easy to think about the properties of mercury (mostly its density) but actually seeing it is really mind blowing. But the imagery of a silver fluid flowing into a toilet bowl instead of something mundane like water gave me that initial thought. Then it stuck with me. I know it's probably unlikely that it'll be used in a similar function to blood, though given the sheer scale of the universe, you never know, but if elemental mercury were to be in a given alien's physiology, what kind of materials would their bodies be made of to allow for such dense fluid to be able to flow. And would gravity on the planet have to be lower or something? Would it even be plausible for living creatures or would it be more likely for something artificial? I'm not even worried about why it'd be used analogously to blood. I'm just wondering what would have to happen for it to be used in the first place. Although for the artificial argument, there are numerous electrical applications for mercury, though I'm not sure it's for the liquid form. 

I'm trying to figure out whether spacecraft could see explosions occurring on the surface of a planet, or under what conditions they could. To be specific: Given a spacecraft equipped with a duplicate of the Keck telescope, using visible light only, watching a planet similar to Earth, at what distance could it see the explosion of one ton of TNT, occurring at sea level at night under a clear sky? 

Sci-fi scenario with flights to a colony planet. Tech level is otherwise close to today (e.g. no androids or desktop nanofactories). Planet is quite similar to Earth, so e.g. agriculture works, you can grow wheat and raise cattle. What would be the likely/optimal ratio of passengers to cargo transported to said planet? Let's say it costs as much to transport one passenger as five tons of cargo, and available transport resources could per year bring 10,000 colonists and 50,000 tons of cargo - that would be splitting the available resources equally. At one extreme, clearly there would be no point hauling 100,000 tons of cargo and nobody to make use of it. At the other extreme, you don't want to put 20,000 colonists on another planet with nothing more than carry-on luggage; even though it's a nice habitable planet, they will still need tools and supplies. Does the above even split of one colonist per five tons of cargo make sense, or can we reasonably say each person would need more cargo, or less? The closest analogy I can think of is the colonization of the Americas. (The main difference being that in the sci-fi scenario, there are no natives.) What was the overall ratio of people to cargo transported from Europe to America during that time period? 

So... these are vague estimates. Like said before, it depends where that space ship (and the pod) did land at the end. If you want an agency to pop up and take things in their hands, you should crash that ship somewhere you know a superior intelligence service is working and a big budget is available to spend to such agencies. Russia, China and the USA of course, Europe, India, Japan, British Commonwealth as secondaries... A global working group... oh dear, just claim Illuminates are active again. At all, they even made it into Deus Ex as a group of global rich people, so just throw together some of the more influential companies which may share a common goal and give them a Joint-Venture private security force. And for some goodwill, all your crash-events did happen close to one of their companies. Or better: right on the parking spots for their employees. But if you are after a government agency that may get in charge of the crash-site anywhere, UN and NATO may be your group of choice. Otherwise you will spend most time doing diplomacy, which can get pretty boring. If I could choose the landing-sites... I would place the pod at Antarctica and the UFO somewhere halfway between Europe and the USA - maybe at Iceland (which is not halfway, but... well) - so that every big player get the chance to be there first, while the local authorities are unlikely to be prepared for such a happening. Some of the Oceania-Islands (Java!) may be a good spot too: quite big cities available and most big players within two hours recon-plane-range. At the end... when no evidence of dead alien creatures from the inside made it to the internet, a country or company will try to claim that this is in fact an earth-bound plane which happens to... well, they shouldn't have updated their flight-computer to windows 10. Otherwise it will be a matter of hours before to much evidence is around to conceal this any more. Just take group of students with smartphones and a nearby 4G Phone Transmitter Station... I feel like I did miss something, but maybe it pop up in my mind later... or somebody else does name it. 

For a science fiction story involving time travel, where the protagonists can go back exactly 33 years from 2013 to 1980, and are looking for a way to make a lot of money quickly: Is there any way today (well, in 2013, close enough) to find a list of winning lottery numbers (in any country) from 1980? I've been checking such lottery records as I can find on Google, and none of them seem to go back further than the 90s or thereabouts. (Granted, other forms of information are available back that far like lists of winners of the Grand National and the FA Cup, but I'm curious about the situation with lottery numbers.) 

On a timescale of 1e11 years, all uranium and thorium will have decayed, but planets will still exist, orbiting red dwarf stars. Would it be possible to use lead as a nuclear fuel? In principle, the curve of binding energy says lead fission is an exothermic reaction. Is there a way to do this while getting out more energy than you put in? (Getting out more money than you put in, is of course a bigger challenge, but we are talking about a scenario where there is no competition from uranium or thorium let alone fossil fuels. I'm assuming the minimum size for a viable fusion reactor remains large compared to a few gigawatts.) 

As others have mentioned, solve the storage problem first. If you don't want to necessarily store the energy and there are multiple stars in question, since my reading comprehension is impaired a la sickness, Steven Hawking has speculated, albeit in a simplified manner and through a television program, that should a civilization be able to harness the entire power of a star, they could possibly open wormholes (which if I'm not mistaken, pop in and out of existence at the quantum level). Assuming these wormholes could be captured and stabilized, it might be a convenient mode of transportation. As to collection, others have mentioned Dyson Spheres, but you definitely don't want it to be contiguous. A large array of satellites (perhaps self-replicating to cut down on work required) with very efficient solar panels can possibly form a network. Since they're so close to the star, perhaps the beams will be bent via gravity. Regardless, they can dump the energy to a collection point, and there should probably be six collection points for all the directions. "Up", "down", "left", "right", "front" and "back", all relative to the center of the star. Assuming I didn't misunderstand your question and what Hawking said in that TV program (which is Into The Universe With Steven Hawking, the Aliens episode), and if that was him and not some writer's imagination, the wormhole can allow for a quick transit of energy. So if a smaller division of those already allocated stars can generate wormholes, they can create wormholes to link all the other purely energy "generating" stars, and then that can be redirected by changing the wormhole exit (somehow) to planets that need it in the form of a beam. The aiming has to be correct cause then it goes from power supply to doomsday weapon. This is pretty speculative, but not more than any of the other answers here. 

I'm working on a science fiction story which includes the following premise: Tony Stark invents an unobtainium reactionless engine, and the protagonists want to build a spaceship around it, big enough to carry a nontrivial amount of cargo. They have a company similar to SpaceX, enough money, political authority to bypass red tape and a mandate to waste anything but time. The current idea is to basically take the design of the C5 Galaxy, cut the wings a lot shorter and replace the landing gear with helicopter style skis (the unobtainium engine is VTOL-capable), make a few other tweaks and that should be pretty much it. (Planned flight times are only a day or two, so no worries about extended life support.) How long would it take to build the first model?
