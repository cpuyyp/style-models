Our good friends at the Cochrane Collaboration, who do high-quality meta-analyses, looked at over-the-counter cough medicines: 

Summary: The survey this article was based on was biased, poorly designed and poorly implemented. The conclusions cannot be trusted. 

Also, this Spanish site about the 2015 Mexico Elections explains that voting card is required, and only people issued with them will appear on the electoral rolls. (I am not sure of the page's provenance though.) I think it is reasonable to conclude that the troublesome sentence was mistranslated. 

But this doesn't mean what they claim is wrong, just that you should have your skepticism hat firmly fastened before continuing. 

(That statement was last updated November 2013.) This is inconsistent with my doctor's advice (from two decades ago) and my anecdotal experience that triclosan-based antibacterial hand-washes are efficacious at clearing minor skin infections. Is the use of Triclosan to treat skin infections evidence-based? Have I been treating myself with a placebo? [For completeness, the US EPA also has concerns.] 

Complementary and alternative medicines: use in skin diseases, Magin, Parker; Adams, Jon, Expert Review of Dermatology, Volume 2, Number 1, February 2007 , pp. 41-49(9) I looked for a Cochrane Review (see below for what they are) to see if, perhaps, one of the oils used is considered a conventional, topical treatment for alopecia areata. I found that there are no known good treatments: 

I couldn't even find an abstract of these two papers not hidden behind a paywall. Shame. Anyone with access want to summarise? 

The UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has a 2003 report titled Review of international research literature regarding the effectiveness of auditory bird scaring techniques and potential alternatives by J. Bishop, H. McKay, D. Parrott and J. Allan. It reviews the evidence from a number of reports about bird-scaring and concludes: 

Note: This was just a letter, and probably did not pass a full peer-review. They took three dogs that had already been trained by an organisation, and whose owners and trainers believed were capable of detecting hypoglycemic skin swabs. 

The authors also report that another study reported low correlation between sense of humor and intelligence. 

Before we can point to the evidence that covers help, we need some evidence that there is any problem to solve. In a Salon article, Mary Roach investigated this claim. She spoke to experts from: 

A Radio Lab episode was recently published on this very topic. They debunk a reader's letter to Ann Landers - see Snopes for more. They retell an interesting tale about an Indian election that was initially lost by a single vote. As Mental Floss describe it: 

Conclusion The new vault technology explains much of the difference in audience appeal of vaulting gymnastics over the years. 

I was ready to dismiss that evidence, when I found the equivalent reference on Broken Rites Australia's new web-site: 

Robert Krulwich of NPR claims that Professor Stephen Greenblatt claims that Lucretius (around 99-55BC) said: 

If the question is "Do the grades achieved correlate with salary in the United States?", the answer is murkier, but Yes. 

In short: No, it is not possible to give a hypnotic suggestion (post-hypnotic or during the hypnosis session) to convince someone to kill another person... except to the extent that it is possible to convince people to perform remarkably antisocial, dangerous or objectionable activities stuff even without hypnosis. 

I can't prove that this video is not faked. What I can do is show that boxing matches between humans and kangaroos are not at all extraordinary, and hence the evidence we require to accept that this video is genuine is relatively low, and we can provisionally accept it as probably genuine. Boxing matches between humans and kangaroos used to be a fairly common side-show event. The Early Sports and Pop Culture History Blog attributes the first occurrence to around 1891 in Philadelphia. Soon, in New South Wales in Australia it became entertainment: 

This is not peer-reviewed, and it is about ocean currents, not atmospheric conditions, which I would have though would be closely related but, it says: 

So a journal article in Alternative and Complementary Therapies concludes there is no clinical research to defend the use of this alternative therapy, and this backs up my personal searches, including in the Cochrane database. The closest I found was an abstract for a dissertation for a Naturopath. 

If the second concern was to come about, it would show women's porn-viewing rate as lower-than-actual, which would reinforce our initial expectations. If our expectations are broken despite this bias, we can be confident that our initial expectations of male dominance in porn-watching are incorrect. 

The Reverend Fred Nile MLC is leader of the Christian Democratic Party in Australia. In a letter to a major Australian newspaper on the subject of ethics classes as an alternative to Special Religious Instruction in Australia schools, he wrote of the opponents to his proposed bill: 

Their references seem to be largely based on newspaper articles, which isn't reassuring. (They also cite Food Reference but they aren't terribly wedded to the claim, prefixing it with "supposedly".) The Straight Dope tried an ad hoc experiment, showing that even ignoring the cost of digestion, over a period of an hour eating celery, the total calories consumed were outweighed by the base rate of calorie-burning by a person eating (or even resting) 

Diagnoses of Fluoride Toxicity is documented by Medscape It discusses patient presentation, and differential diagnoses, so other poisonings are not confused with it. It suggests the following tests when fluoride poisoning is suspected: 

While they are vague about how many people are included in a "large" population movement, they quote another researcher with a similar, more precise figure. 

i.e. while weather may have a small affect on sales, it only changed when people spent their money - not how much people spent in a month. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the paper to confirm the following: 

The question has been recently clarified to be whether shuriken could kill, rather than whether they were historically used to kill. This issue was looked at in a German study that was looking for evidence on whether to support a ban on modern variants. 

Yes, tobacco companies add additives to cigarettes, and those additives have an effect.

So, we can't give a single, simple answer. Some Data Points Here are some data-points from individual studies: 

(This chart has been turned into an infographic which I find doesn't help very much, but you may prefer it.) From this chart, you can see that Jews have the highest proportion of household income of greater than $US100,000. Similarly, they are the second-least-likely to have household incomes of less than $US30,000, after Hindus. 

The story is slightly less dramatic than it sounds. The runways themselves are not being "shifted" (i.e. construction crews getting out and laying tarmac), but just renamed and signposted. From a Livescience report
