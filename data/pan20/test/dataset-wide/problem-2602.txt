While this answer might be controversial on this site I myself have struggled with this question for a long time. This is my perspective, nothing more. The answer is no, currently, there is not a proof of karma or reincarnation that I have found to be convincing. However, the inverse is also true... there is not a proof that eliminates the possibility of karma or reincarnation that I have found to be convincing. The conclusion I came to was that the timetables involved of lifetimes of rebirth made it impossible to set up an experiment that proved the issue one way or another. Believe me, I tried, for ~3 years I made myself the experiment. It was an existential adventure I do not regret. Now it is said that some people after a certain point in the path remember all their past lives, and to them, that would be a personal proof. But to me it is anecdotal, and I could not accept it as proof unless I myself experienced it. Even if I experienced it myself, I would not consider it a proof for other people for the same reasons. 

Nine times out of ten the action or event is inconsequential and effects us only in a minor fashion if we can find the comedy in the situation to focus on our drives will be much more relaxed. 

Yes, killing a human generates far more karma then crushing an ant. However the size of the seed does not determine the outcome of the seed. One teacher once noted that the karma of swatting a fly grows exponentially. That after a few days, especially if it is a repeated action, it can be grown to the size of the initial seed of killing a human. However the initial human killing seed grows similarly as fast. The thing is we have all these seeds or "karmic imprints" if you will, that are all maturing and ripening. Both good an bad, and they are coming in at a rate of around 60 imprints a second. I once let a mosquito eat its fill from my arm back when I was more seriously into Buddhism, the thought process was along the lines of sure, I have plenty of blood... eat up. The bite was magnificently itchy, and I will never do such again. Now I crush mosquitoes, I don't enjoy killing them, I don't seek it out, but if one is buzzing around in my apartment it is off to the bardo with it. However, squirrels raiding your garden, that is a slightly different scenario. Have you researched other options? Is there another way to protect your garden? It would be worth it to explore these questions from a karmic standpoint. Better to plant as few of those kinds of seeds as possible, or plant the opposite kind of seed... maybe out of compassion put out some food that squirrels eat and enjoy nearby, if the squirrel is hungry you will get the karma of feeding a being of lesser sentience. A full squirrel is less likely to raid your garden. Another thing to consider is the attachment to the garden, and the outcome of the harvest. If you lose one or two tomatoes, but harvest 12, really I'd say let the squirrel do its thing. I don't know the full extent of the raiding though, perhaps this squirrel ate all of your tomatoes. It still is not after your blood though, so there is that. 

It is true that there is no permanent identity of self and there is no identity of self which doesn't result in suffering. Nirvana is permanent , full of blessings, and is unchangeable. We humans can reach to the state of Nirvana by following the Buddha and his Dhamma. So my question is : Why can not we call Nirvana the true self of ours? (As an example I can say that I am not form,feelings,perceptions,volition,consciousness but I am the permanent , pleasant and unchangeable state of Nirvana) 

I think violation of five precepts constitute bad action and keeping of five precepts constitute good action. 

Buddha says if you follow the teachings exactly then you will be free of suffering. There is no time limit. It may happen in this life or it may happen after few lives. 

Namo Buddhaya. Buddha talks about walking meditation at several places in the suttas for example here. However he doesn't mention it in the Long discourse about the ways of attending to mindfulness. There are 4 ways of attending to mindfulness but none of them mention walking or walking meditation. My questions are : Why doesn't Buddha mention about the walking or walking meditation in the long discourse about the ways of attending to mindfulness? Is there any sutta where Buddha talks about the technique of walking meditation? 

There are five clinging aggregates. Here it states that one's self clings to the five aggregates. To quote: 

I have found hard to get stories and teachings of Buddha in the book Manual of Buddhism by Hardy Spence. Is Manual of Buddhism by Hardy Spence, a good book to study Buddhism? 

In Mudita meditation or Joy Meditation I am supposed to experience Joy for all beings. But I don't know which aspect of living beings is worth celebrating. My question is : How should I express Mudita or Joy for all beings? EDIT: To support my mental dilemma I quote Maiterya. 

In the quote " Sabbe Sankhara Anicca", what is the meaning of word Sankhara? Is the word "Sankhara" derived from Sanskrit word "Sanskara"? 

Gautama Buddha died and had attained final Nirvana. His cleaving to existing objects had ceased. His ignorance was destroyed. He had no upadana or karma left. Yet Buddha said that he will take rebirth as Metteyya. 

Anxiety is a kind of suffering. If we follow the path leading to cessation of suffering then all kinds of suffering will end. You should not be feeling any anxiety because there is no You or Me. I think you are (or rather we are) lacking loving-kindness. If we develop loving-kindness then it will definitely help reduce your anxiety. Cultivate the following mindfulness : 

I am riddled by this question lately and it necessary for my progress on path of Dhamma. My question is, why is it that in this life time I have became obsessively bent to attain nibbana while everyone around me is living in total oblivion. Society is by and large enslaved by Mara the evil one. This answer explains in detail. Don't go by the society. I mean if I had so many rebirths in past lives exactly what was I doing all these quantillion lives, was I never told the dhamma. If I was told, then why am I not already enlightened. Was I dumb or something all these lives not to have awaken to the truth of suffering? You were and are under the influence of Mara as is almost everyone. Do you think Steve Jobs was dumb , Bill Gates is dumb or Einstein was dumb ? No. Even the smartest of people fail to get the insight. What must have been my mistake all these lives? How can I rectify that mistake so that I can felicitate my nibbana in this life? Yours and everyone's mistake is that they haven't renounced the self and the world. They still think that the eyes is theirs. They still still think ears is theirs. They still think body is theirs. They still think Mind is theirs. When in actuality it all belongs to Mara. To rectify the mistake ,I guess the best way would be to, renounce the world and walk the path which Buddha laid.
