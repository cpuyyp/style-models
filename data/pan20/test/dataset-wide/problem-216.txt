Bear in mind that if you really accelerated to light speed on a trip to Mars, circa 150 millions miles, the acceleration would be awesome. Assume you accelerate so that you reach light speed half way there, and then decelerate for the rest of the trip. That would require an acceleration of 230 miles per second per second, or 1.2 million feet per second per second, or 38,000 g's! Everyone and everything on board would be crushed the instant you turned on the engines. Well, maybe you're assuming that if we had the means to travel at light speed, we'd also have some way to cancel the effects of the acceleration. My first question is: Why do you need to be able to travel around the solar system in minutes? Slow it down to days and it's still a trip that people could make routinely, but it would be painfully slow for interstellar travel. Like if it takes, say, 2 days to get to Mars, that's an average speed of 3.1 million miles per hour. Incredible speed! But at that rate it would take you over 200 years to reach Alpha Centauri. I think the easy answer to your problem is to just slow the ships down to the point that interplanetary travel takes reasonable amounts of time but interstellar is multiple lifetimes. If you really need your ships to reach another planet in minutes for your story to work, I guess you'd have to posit some reason why they either, (a) can't travel far from the Sun or a planet; or (b) can't travel more than x distance. RE (a) Maybe they are solar powered. Too far from the Sun, not enough energy, they don't work. Hmm, but why couldn't you put a nuclear reactor on board to supply energy instead? Maybe some hand-waving there. Maybe they need a solar wind for some reason? (b) is easier: They require huge amounts of fuel. The longer the trip, the more fuel, of course, But it doesn't go up linearly, it goes up exponentially, because for a long trip, you have to carry enough fuel to propel all the fuel for the rest of the trip. Just like present-day rockets require huge amounts of fuel because you have to burn enough fuel in the first few seconds to get the fuel for the entire rest of the trip off the launch pad, etc. You could say that the fuel requirements rise such that for a trip of light-years, the equation becomes unsolvable, an infinite amount of fuel would be required. Ok, I haven't worked out the math if that's actually possible, but at least, an amount of fuel so large that it would take all the fuel you could possibly produce for hundreds of years. 

What do you mean when you ask "can I"? If you mean, is this scientifically possible, the answer is no. The periodic table isn't just a random collection of elements put together in an arbitrary order. An element's position in the periodic table determines all sorts of attributes of that element. When Mendeleev proposed the periodic table, he arranged elements to fit the available spaces, and he noticed a number of gaps. He then theorized that these gaps represented elements that had not yet been discovered. He described what the properties of these elements would be, things like what other elements they would combine with, density, freezing and boiling points, etc. When other chemists found these elements and they fit Mendeleev's predictions, that was strong evidence that his theory was correct. Thus, any element appearing at a certain location in the periodic table MUST have certain properties. But if you mean, if I need a new element with certain properties to make my story work, can I pretend it exists? At which point one can only say, or what? The Novel Writing Police will not arrest you for inventing a fictitious element. I doubt that a horde of chemists will form a mob and attack you in the street. The nature of fiction is that as long as you state your premises up front, and make the rest of the story follow logically from that, the reader will generally go along. You only alienate the reader if you wait to introduce made-up facts until the time when they're needed to make the story work. Like, if at the beginning of a mystery story you mention that the victim always wore red socks, and then at the end the brilliant detective refers to this crucial clue to solve the case, all fair. But if you never mentioned it before and suddenly at the climax of the story the detective says, "And as the victim always wore red socks, therefore ..." and this solves the case, the reader is going to feel cheated because you brought this in out of nowhere. 

If these people are all trying to communication, I don't think the process would be particularly difficult. Tedious, but not difficult. They could surely teach each other nouns by pointing to objects and saying their word for it. Like, if I was trying to communicate and the other person pointed at a banana and said "frangbar", I'd take it that "frangbar" means "banana". Etc. Similarly one could mimic simple actions. like jump up and down and say your word for "jump". Etc. Once we'd established those we could start working on adjectives. Like take a big banana and a small banana and say "big banana" and "small banana", etc. Of course there would be ambiguities and mistakes, but you work through them. I'm reminded of a lecture I once heard from a missionary explaining how he learned the language of a previously unknown tribe. He mentioned that on one occasion he pointed to a hut and asked "what is that?", and the other person gave the word for "finger", because he thought he was holding up a finger rather than pointing at something. Etc. 

What is on the other side of the wall? If there are hostile people or dangerous animals there, then someone who swims or builds a boat to go around the wall would have no safe place to go. The water could be full of sharks or other dangerous sea creatures to prevent people from swimming. People could have the engineering skill to build houses and tools but have no idea how to build a boat. But this gets weak if we're talking about simply getting around a wall across an isthmus. I could easily believe that people can't leave an island because they don't know how to build boats capable of travelling hundreds or thousands of miles. Tougher to believe they can't figure out how to build a simple raft that would take them past a wall. How thick can this wall be? A few feet? Strapping a few logs together so you can sail ten feet doesn't seem all that tough, you'd think someone would think of it sooner or later. How about something cultural? These people have just never thought of the idea of travelling by water. Or they have a superstition about water, they think ghosts inhabit it or something. Seems to me that sooner or later someone would test such beliefs, but it might be plausible. Can there be people actively patrolling the waters around the peninsula? Powerful warships quickly sink any boat these people can build and massacre the survivors? Oh, or how about: the shoreline is steep cliffs. Sure, they could build a boat. But then they'd have to lower it 100 feet to the water and climb down. Then they sail around the wall but to get ashore, they would somehow have to climb from the boat up a 100 foot cliff. It would be possible, of course, but very difficult, the few who try it fail and everyone else just accepts it as impossible.
