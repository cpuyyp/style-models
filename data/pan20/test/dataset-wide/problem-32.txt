Smiling may be misinterpreted by an alien culture - the difference between a smile and the aggressive baring of teeth might not be clear (if the latter is indeed something the aliens would assume). However, I would expect that the possibility of misunderstandings will occur to both parties, and so each side will be correspondingly cautious about reacting prematurely. When humans need to communicate and lack a common language, or have any other communicative difficulty, we tend to default to nonverbal interpretation (body language, crude gestures, facial expressions). These are treated as more basic, and more translatable than verbal language. This tends to be true for dealing with animals, as well as other human cultures, since body language and especially aggression and threat tend to be fairly intuitive, and reading them (for those on our own planet) are a survival mechanism. So, even though we know, really really know, that aliens might not share body language or nonverbal signals, we will probably be trying to fit whatever they are doing into our expectations, as they will be trying to translate our own signals. It is a survival mechanism, to try and figure out the threat level as best we can. I would expect this kind of thing to be a possible problem mostly during first contact, when both sides are trying to figure out how to communicate and if the other side is hostile or friendly. Once there is some common ground for communicating, it would make more sense to ask before taking a gesture as a threat, although miscommunications may still occur. Smiling is an easy point to pick at, since it is already close to an aggressive signal (baring one's teeth). There might be other signals that translate poorly, though - showing hands is a peaceful move for us (look, no weapons), but may be an aggressive one to a species that uses their hands to fight with directly - ironically, something that occasionally comes up in fantasy in reference to mages. Something I read a long time ago had a species try to signal non-aggression by showing their unarmored bellies - which backfired a bit, since they did so by rearing up, not rolling over, and so scared the people they were trying to communicate with. Eye contact is sometimes aggressive, something like a challenge, and sometimes a friendly connection. Crouching down might mean non-aggressively trying to seem smaller, or a prelude to pouncing. There are a lot of ways to misunderstand body language and gestures, even when we have previous experience to guess from - and with aliens, we won't. So where does that leave us? We should probably not try to anticipate how body language will be received, it's too hard to anticipate without more knowledge. It's probably better to act as normally as we can, and adjust our behavior depending on how it is received. We will probably also try any signals we know of from a species that looks similar to said aliens (if there are any that look even vaguely similar). Pausing, or backing away are rarely seen as aggressive moves, and moving slowly and stopping any gesture that's received poorly (or reacted to strongly) may also help diffuse tensions. Mimicking is probably also a possible avenue of communication, indicating that someone is paying attention and wants to communicate. As long as both sides keep the possibility of miscommunication in mind, any accidental mistranslation can probably be worked out peaceably. 

Maybe, if you're willing to have a strong eugenic culture. And a strong stomach. a lot of forward planning, stability, and ideas that will let them work with genetics (doesn't have to be right ideas, mind, just close enough to let them function). So, what your dynasty needs, is to generally practice having as many kids as possible. All the kids, really a dozen per individual or more is ideal - include any born out of wedlock or wrong side of the sheets, it will only help. Then, kill any kid that shows a negative genetic trait (madness, physical deformity, hemophilia, whatever) - and possibly even their kids, if it wasn't caught before they grew up and had kids of their own. That's why you need so many kids to start with, so that you can get rid of any who look like they've got unhealthy genes. So, breeding too closely is a problem primarily because it increases the chance poor recessives come to the surface. Killing off anyone who shows these recessive traits will, over time, weed them out of the bloodline. Especially if anyone suspected of being a carrier is also discouraged from breeding. A lot of people would be killed for non-heritable problems, as well, since there would hard to tell if a problem that develops is actually environmental or heritable unless you've got a good genetic testing setup, or several generations to track and correlate. You will need a strongly planned family - every now and then the family can pick a negative trait and spend several generations trying to eliminate it (the madness, or weak eyes, or something) - since trying to fix them all at once might depopulate the family too much, and leave no one to breed it back up. Eventually, your family line will hit a point where all the recessives are clean (because any who weren't got killed or banned from reproduction for so long). If this happens, everyone in the family will have virtually identical genetics, family characteristics will be very strong, variation will be very shallow. If something happens that the genetics don't have an answer for, like a new disease, they all die - but they will be very strong within those traits they do have, specialized. It's actually something like an artificially created genetic bottleneck, with the occasional infusions fresh genes from out-of-family marriages and bastard children possibly helping to keep the family line from self-destructing before then (and better yet if some of those fresh genes were chosen for traits they desired to breed into the line). If it goes far enough, it will result in a breed apart - and I mean like a dog breed, with characteristic physical features (and problems), and their attendant tradeoffs. The occasional infusion of fresh genes should keep them from drifting into a new species - but it's on the horizon once they reach this point, and depending on the genetic drift of their surrounding population.
