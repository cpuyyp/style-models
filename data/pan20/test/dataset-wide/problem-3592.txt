I would like to lose some body fat and get stronger. I've always tried to stay active, but due to a bad diet (result of stress) I haven't managed to lose weight as much as I would like. But I think I have found a routine which would work for me (i.e. I would enjoy it): Joyful Routine Mon/Wed/Fri - early mornings - Strength Training (5x5 by Mark Rippetoe). No cardio. Mon/Wed - evenings - 2 hours active dance (similar to Zumba but more intense). Tue/Thu - evenings - 1.5 hours Muay Thai. Sunday - 2 hours volleyball. Very light. Me I'm 5'9" (175cm), 185lbs (84kg), 26 y.o. Reasonably active with some previous weightlifting, martial arts and Zumba experience. Also I cycle daily 16km (10 miles) to work 4 days per week (but I will probably give up cycling if I continue with my plan) Question I have checked similar questions on this site and google, and I know about sleeping requirements and I have created my diet plan. But given my specific workout plan and my health in general, would it be too much stress for the body? I am aware that due to my weight and intense routine I might need to take extra care with my joints, proper warm up and stretching. I would appreciate your views on this subject. 

Exercise will not increase intelligence. However, I can tell you from my own expierience that if you are a consistent exerciser that it definitely increases the conditioner's focus. When I started lifting in high school, I noticed my grades increased drastically and my attention span during class was much longer. Sure, some could call it coincidental but I noticed when I took a 2 month break my grades dropped a little lower. Is that a coincidence? Not only that, but side effects of exercise consist of: Longer life span(extends it 5-10 years) Optimism Self-Confidence and courage Self-respect Respect from others Strengthens bones Strengthens muscles Improves fitness level Sense of self-accomplishment Lets you contact your inner self(better meditation) Opens new doors 

So whenever I do standing military press with any weight, it seems to kind of tear at my back. Not my lower back, but maybe my upper or middle. Anyone with similar experiences?How do I avoid this? Am I using proper form? 

It probably maximizes hand strength and works the same as regular push ups(chest, triceps, etc.) But why would you do push ups on your thumbs? You'll end up with 2 broken thumbs and even more serious, 2 broken wrists. Also, not only that, but your traps(upper back) muscles are worked with regular push ups anyway. 

The more calories you consume, and carbohydrates are calories in their simplest form, the less quickly you will lose weight. Example : If you were to consume 1400 calories/day and burning 1750 calories/day you will lose 1 pound in 10 days. Adding 175 calories in carbohydrates/day to your diet you will lose that same pound in 20 days. This assumes that the only changing variable in your body was calories in and calories out. From the math standpoint, yes you should cut out the carbs on the weekend if your goal is to lose weight at your current rate. There are many other factors that one could argue about leaving in the weekend carbs. To add another point in here, protein is the food source that will help you build and maintain muscle mass. However, consuming more than 2g protein/1kg body weight, even for elite athletes is mostly wasted. Your body also processes real protein (fish, chicken, tuna, eggs, etc.) better than whey powder. Yet, if you feel you can not meet your protein intake with real food, supplements are what you should look at. 

You need to focus on the weak arm. I am so right handed I can't stand it. When I am in the gym I have to make a very concerted effort to isolate my left arm. I have also noticed that my left arm has naturally formed bad habits from being my non-dominant hand. So when you focus on it, also concentrate on proper form. Don't shy away from doing tricep-dips, French-bar curls, etc. Just be extra conscious of the weaker arm. Also be aware that everyone's body is different. My right deltoid muscles seem to have a noticeably shorter muscle belly than my left. Therefore my shoulders look asymmetrical. Even though my right shoulder is a little stronger than my left. Nothing I can do about it but try and accept the results. 

If your question is strictly referring to just gaining muscle mass, then of course the steroid user shall make gains in mass whether they work out or not. However, where these gains are and how much gains they get shall depend on if they are lifting or not. You may have heard that steroid usage will enhance one's performance at powerlifting, but this will not be the case if the user doesn't work out, due to the fact that steroids prioritize deltoid, traps, and lat muscles, which none of are the main muscle used for powerlifting. That being stated, if a sedentary person has broad shoulders and a wide back, but the rest of their body is weak, they are probably using steroids. Also, the muscle mass gained would not be as much as an active steroid user. But why would you want to take steroids? The negative effects definitely outweigh the positive effects. 

I am really eager to know how to achieve those coconut shoulders! Could someone who has them that isn't a drug user please say how they got them?! 

So I have noticed a considerable amount of guys in my gym will not do any leg work(as much as 50% on some days).... All they do is bench and do bicep curls... Why don't a lot of guys wanna do leg work? 

The more repetitions you can do, the more you are moving towards endurance training. That is to say, you will develop muscles that can perform the same motion over and over without tiring as easily. Heavier weight with fewer repetitions is more for building muscle mass. That being said, just performing 10 sets of push-ups for 5 repetitions will not build muscle mass unless your body perceives your body weight as "heavy". If you can perform 5 push ups and feel like you've done nothing, you would not build muscle or move toward that endurance state. So really, it is relative to how your body responds to the stress placed upon it. For comparison sake, look at endurance runner's legs (think 1 set of 50 repetitions) versus a sprinter's legs (think 1 set of 5 reps). 

Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise will increase the pressure inside your body. Aerobic exercise speeds up your heart rate (baring the use of rate limiting drugs). Stroke volume (the volume of blood ejected from the heart with each beat) is also increased with aerobic exercise. For both reasons, since the vascular system is a closed pathway, blood pressure goes up. Anaerobic exercise is more apt to increase your inner thoracic cavity pressure (pressure inside your chest/stomach) than your blood pressure. An exception might be doing dynamic-anaerobic weight lifting movements (walking lunges) where the movement is still classified as anaerobic but still taxes your body enough your heart rate increases. Working in a hospital setting our limitations for blood pressures that we don't allow patients to exercise are over 180/106 or below 90/60. Those limitations also change if a patient is symptomatic (light headed, dizzy, nauseous, chest pain, etc.). If your blood pressure has started becoming gradually higher you should probably go talk to your primary care physician to discuss if anything needs to be pursued. If it was a one time deal you should be fine (exceptions being symptomatic). All different things can affect your blood pressure: Stress, Sleep, Fluid retention, even body position (laying down, seated, standing). 

The answer usually varies, but if we are talking about exercises such as swimming, running, walking, and biking(cardio, more commonly known as) then the answer is no as long as you are not doing an insane aerobic workout. For example, say that you are running 3 miles every other day. Will this hurt you in the long run? No. But now say that your friend is running 10 miles every single day. Assuming your friend is not extraordinary genetically gifted or is squatting for 8 hours every other day, eventually his/her leg muscles would shrink in size. This is because the muscles require more oxygen to be circulated through them so they shrink down to be able to push the oxygen cells closer together. So in other words, say this: If someone is reading 150 pages out of a book every day without eye breaks, they are more likely to develop blurred vision then someone reading 20 pages a day with no eye breaks(assuming these people are reading about 40 pages an hour). So, to make a long story short, yes if you are taking cardio or pilates to an extreme level it will kill your gains. But doing it moderately, or even at a somewhat advanced level, it will not as long as you say you won't swim over 5 miles a day or bike over 50, etc. When they tell you to "sit still," they mean to not lift weights. 

From get-rich-quick perspective, I picked up skiing very quickly thanks to two exercises: roller-blading and squats. Few more useful links: Building up your skiing muscles and The Best Stretches And Exercices For Skiing And Snowboarding. 

If you would like to develop flexibility while continuing to burn body fat, I can highly recommend Hot (Bikram) yoga. I have tried gymnastics for adults and capoeira to develop flexibility, but the fastest results I have achieved were while doing Bikram yoga. (I've heard that due to the heat you can push your body to the limits, but it can be dangerous). I have also burnt a lot of fat while doing Bikram because you sweat continuously. 

Cycling, roller-blading - fun, similar to skiing experience. Also perfect exercises for improving joint mobility and stamina. If you do some uphill cycling, you could also work on your muscle strength. Squats, deadlifts - I'm personally following Starting Strength program. Very good exercises for developing your legs and your body overall. Abs - any abs exercise will do. Pull-ups, bench presses - for developing your arms. Jogging - just to stay fit and develop your stamina. 

There are varying ranges of educational levels for trainers. They could be non-high school graduates that sat for one of the 4-6 hour personal training courses to those having a Bachelor's in Exercise Science with a Master's of Exercise Physiology. Some of the time trainers will not know the reasoning behind a method (keeping the muscles warm in this case); and rather that it is a widely accepted norm. That being said, keeping muscles warm post heavy lifting is a viable technique for most lifters. The article that Kate posted addresses everything you would need to know about your original question. Keeping your muscles warm and doing some light stretching will also help you keep the same (if not improve) muscle flexibility. 

You can also go see a vascular specialist. Peripheral Artery Disease can cause those symptoms; but, so can many other things. Our facility performs free screenings for PAD. Look and see if there is someplace you can get a free screening before seeking other medical help. If for no other reason, than to rule out something like PAD. 

Your hamstrings attach on your Ischial Tuberosity (your "sit bones", like when you tell someone they have a boney butt if they sit in your lap). Your Erector Spinae muscles are a group of muscles that run up your spine. Part of this group is the Iliocostalis that originates along your Sacrum (tail bone) and Iliac crest (your hip bone). I am assuming that when you stretch for your hamstrings you are letting your back round out. This would allow the lower part of your back to stretch as well. Adding a 60 pound pack while doing PT is a lot of change for your body. If the pain is mildly uncomfortable but just "sore" your pain could be a few things. If your pain is hindering your range of motion or sends sharp pains anywhere you should go see a doctor as soon as you can. If you don't normally feel a lot of pain you should go regardless because your body might not be able to sense how hurt it really is. If it is a muscle imbalance I would be willing to bet your lower abdominal muscles are under-developed compared to your back and your hip flexors are tight. Any of the exercises here should do the job for the lower abs. As a side note, I did not notice them tell you in the videos but your hands should be on the hamstring side of your hips (not in your lower back). This help keep your lower back in the floor, relieving the stress place upon it. You can stretch your hip flexors by performing this stretch. If you do not feel comfortable doing this on your own, ask a trainer or someone in your unit that is more familiar with having "perfect" form while doing exercise. 

So I live in Wisconsin, and I take my motor boat out on Lake Michigan every week or so during this Summer, usually about 30 or 40 miles out. I am literally the only one out there. It's water as far as the eye can see. Anyway, I have a built on ladder and stabilizers I have been using to get back on the boat when I'm done swimming. I get out, with a life jacket on and swim around and enjoy the peace and quiet for about 20 minutes. My only concern is what happens if my boat sinks or I can't get back on it or something. I am a male of age 27,height 5"10, weigh 155 and used to swim for my high school team. Is this okay? 

So I have noticed that I am doing far beyond 20 reps of push ups and still, after I have done about 50 of them, or even 2 sets of 25 my arms feel like they're expanding and growing muscle, both the biceps and triceps. This is confusing to me because I thought that over 20 reps only builds stamina and endurance, not stronger muscles. If this is the case, why do my arms feel like they're growing? Are they?
