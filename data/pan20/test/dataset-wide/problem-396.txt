So the trick is to create a separate space for the chlorine and the fluoride in the dragon. Set up the dragon's system so that it separates fluorine from the atmosphere (there are tons of fluoride compounds floating around up there) and stores it in a specialized air sack along one side. The same system is necessary for the chlorine, which will be gotten from sea-water. The dragon can separate the chlorine from the sodium and will store both. The chlorine will be stored in another air sack on the other side of its body, which will need to be coated in strong mucus because Cl2 will form hydrochloric acid if it comes into contact with water, the sodium will be stored in a special oil gland. When the dragon wishes to breath ClF3, it simply expels both fluorine and chlorine at the same time. The fluorine will coat the dragon's mouth, preventing ClF3 from hurting it. The gases will mix, yielding ClF3 and excess chlorine gas, which is also toxic. The fluorine that coats the dragon's mouth can be reused. The sodium the dragon extracts from the sea water can be used as a separate attack. The dragon can expel clumps of sodium, which reacts violently with water. These bombs could be spat out with force, or simply dropped down on people or ships. 

Save Sergey Pavlovich Korolyov. He was the mastermind of basically all of the U.S.S.R.'s space equipment, and he was flying circles around the U.S. scientists until he died in 1966. We don't really know exactly what happened to him. He might have had cancer in his abdomen, he might have had a botched surgery. Either way, on January 14, 1966 in Moscow, Russia, Sergey Korolyov went into the hospital for a fairly routine operation and did not come out. If you want the Soviets to win the space race, interrupt this event. One thing that we do know is that Sergey was getting sick, hence the operation, and either his cancer was too advanced or his doctor was bad, so your best bet is to get him into the hospital sooner. Part of the reason he died was his time spent in concentration camps, but you can't mess with that without risking him never getting into rockets, so it's best to just keep him alive after he's already in. Now, a man goes to the doc. when he feels sick, except Sergey didn't listen to his doc. for a long time because he was so devoted to his space toys. I recommend lightly poisoning him at some prior time so he has to go to the doctor and they can find the cancer/ulcers sooner and either get the cancer or get a better doctor to operate. Naturally, the government kept a pretty close watch on this guy, but there was plenty of time for him to get poisoned. Just pick your moment, slip him something freaky enough to get him to the hospital but not so freaky as to kill him. I recommend Rifampicin, an antibacterial commonly used to treat tuberculosis. Sergey didn't have TB, but an antibacterial can't hurt. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, and, best of all, red or orange sweat, urine, and tears. That should certainly get him to a doctor. Also, another cause of orange urine is spinal abscesses, so the doc. will surely give him a thorough inspection. Additionally, Rifampicin wasn't used as a medicine until 1971, well after it would be used to save Sergey, so the doctors wouldn't jump to it's use in creating these symptoms. Rifampicin comes in tablet form and can be easily crushed and added to food or drink. A small amount should do, so it's no trouble to take it with you, or, since it was invented in 1957, you could try to find some "in situ". 

I really don't think diffusion will do it for you. Our lungs work because of their vast surface area, and unless you plan to have a bowl-shaped city (basically just a hole) you're not going to have enough surface area for adequate air exchange. Tunnels are problematic if they collapse, but with a few simple precautions, the risk of collapse is minimal. First, make your air tunnels as vertical as possible. Don't slant, don't slope, just go straight down. That way, if there is an earthquake, the weight above the tunnel won't collapse it because there is little to no real weight pressing down on the tunnel. Second, wall the tunnels in concrete. If your society is not that advanced, use anything. Even resin or baked clay, just something to keep dirt from falling off the walls and into the tunnel. If the city is build into bedrock, this isn't really a problem. These shafts can be dug to any depth you need, so your city can go down as far as you like without too much degrade in air quality as long as you have enough shafts. With several, large, vertical shafts in place throughout the city, install fans. Set up some shafts with fans pulling fresh air down, and some with fans blowing old air up and out. Keep canaries around the updraft shafts. The air quality will be the worst there, so if the birds are fine, you should be too. If the birds die, move the cages farther away. Establish barriers to danger zones based on bird tests. All the fans should be alarmed. If any one stops working, a loud alarm will sound, warning people that there is a problem and that they should seek better air. I also recommend CO2 and CO monitors, much like the ones we have today. These should be installed around the city and should be linked to a central server so that people can be warned that an area is unsafe. I wouldn't count on plants to oxygenate your city, but if you really want to use them, you have some real-world examples to draw from. $URL$ If nothing else, you could have a plant room for emergencies, just in case the fans stop or the shafts collapse or something. 

A fully prehensile tail, a beaver tail, or a stiff tail might be helpful. The beaver or stiff tail could be used as a weapon, particularly in a spinning kick sort of situation. Another blunt instrument attached to your body seems useful, even if it can't grab or wield things. It could be used to trip the opponent as well, assuming the tail were stiff enough to swipe out a person's legs. A prehensile tail could possibly hold a shield to protect the person's back, or maybe hold a blade to cut the opponent as you spin. Fluffy, thin, or rattling tails would probably be neutral. There's not much you can do with that sort of tail, other than maybe whap the other person's face and hope it stuns them. In the heat of battle, I don't think a rattle would distract your opponent, nor would a flashy peacock tail. The best strategy for those with this sort of tail would probably be to tie the tail to one leg, keeping it out of the way. It wouldn't hamper them too much, and it would be unlikely to get cut off or stomped on. A peacock tail would be bad. I don't know about a longer, bright tail, but I'm picturing a full-on peacock tail, and it isn't good. The feathers, or possibly big fur tufts, would get in the way and would not help at all. Maybe as camouflage the tail could help, but in battle it would just get in the way, and there's really no good way to tie down a big, fat peacock tail. You might be able to gather all the feathers together and band them together into a long, stiff bundle, which could maybe be used as a stiff tail, but it would probably be uncomfortable and clumsy. It would also take extensive preparation as you'd probably need someone to help you. 

I don't know about any others. Most things that can hurt you by contact are relieved simply by removing contact, and most cures are specifically designed not to become the next problem. Personally, I would say that "artificial poison" and "venom" aren't opposite because they are basically the same thing, but that's not really my call. If you count such things, you could do venom and antivenom because most antivenom is made from venom. I recommend using two types in this case, IE viper venom, mamba antivenom. I would also not count things like "bacteria" and "nanobots" if they both bring about the same result because they are basically the same thing. I would also recommend giving whoever contacts these chests a cut of some sort to expedite the effects of the substances. 

Life span directly relates to body mass and metabolism. Each creature (I'll attach conditions in a moment) gets about a billion heart beats in its life. For smaller creatures with high metabolism, like sparrows and rabbits, this means a very short lifespan, sometimes only a few years. For larger animals with slower metabolisms, like tortoises and elephants, this means a longer lifespan, sometimes over 100 years. Interestingly, chickens and humans are big exceptions, each of them having double the average number of heartbeats per lifetime. So the question is: How big and how fast? If your species is small and moves rapidly, then their lifespans will probably be in the two-to-five year range. If your species is big and slow, look in the 70-to-120 year range. With that in mind, remember that age does not the species make. With a shorter life, the individual has a higher rate of living, by which I mean that everything happens faster. A rabbit matures much more quickly than does an elephant, but both have comparable percentages of infancy- the percent of the individual's life that it spends in infancy is comparable betwixt the two. You might have a species that lives only a year, but you can still write a coming-of-age story. Likewise, you might have a species that lives for a century and a half, but you can still cover all its life in one book. The trouble arises when you try to apply human time scales to non-human creatures. Take an extreme example, a species with a lifespan of ten minutes. Within ten minutes, an individual is born, lives, breeds, and dies. You could write a novel about the individual, just as you might about a human. There could be legends of a time, many many generations ago, so long ago that it is almost forgotten, when the world was dark, and there was no light anywhere (night-time) or when all the world was blazing with light (day-time). It all depends on the time scale, which I assume will be on the scale of the species whose lifespan you are trying to calculate. As long as your time scale matches your species lifespan, it really doesn't matter, other than stuff like seasons passing or the landscape changing. It's all about percentages and perceptions.
