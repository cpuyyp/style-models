If there were uncountably many real numbers, then almost all of them would be undefinable because the set of finite strings, including the set of definitions as its subset, is countable. But the set of real numbers is not uncountable (and therefore there are no undefinable real numbers). If it were uncountable, then the set of paths of the Binary Tree representing all real numbers of the unit interval [0, 1) would be uncountable too. This can be contradicted however by the fact that the nodes are undisputedly countable and when fixing three paths (here shown in red) to every node (which do not further cross any node, like lametta) we get a countable set of lametta paths that for every level is larger than the set of distinct paths in the original Binary Tree. This proves, in classical mathematics, that the limit of paths in the original Binary Tree cannot be larger. 

Perhaps it is helpful to emphasize the aspect of set theory. The set of dogs is a subset of the set of mammals. If there is an element of some basic universal set (that has its well-known problems which do not interfere with the present topic however) that has the property dog, then this element has the property mammal too. That means "if dog then mammal" or in short D → M. In the form "every dog is a mammal" and "if a dog, then a mammal" the statements are nearly identical. Here and also in form used in the original question they express exactly the same information. 

Of course there are objects like an electric field or a phonograph that were inconceivable to primitive humans of Stone Age. And there are modern devices like micro chips or lasers or cell phones that were inconceivable to people 200 years ago because the effects they are based upon were far out of reach even for advanced physicists of that time. It is inconceivable that this series will stop. (And if it would then this very fact is inconceivable today.) 

I agree that to define metaphysics as the study of the "nature of reality" is completely inadequate. It is a shallow definition, misleading, arguably circular. You leave us with a very complicated mission, though, if you expect the answer to this question to be given in pragmatic ("black and white") terms. The first thing that comes to my mind is that the answer would have to be like a confusion-killing bullet, a short, almost poetic formula. Fearless as I feel today of the occasional downvote, I'll give it a shot. 

I'll assume you are talking about Philosophy as a singular object, not as an ordinary activity. To differentiate, I'll capitalize the first, and not the second. What "is" Philosophy is – and arguably always will be – an open question. Books are still being written about it, and every original work in Philosophy (a rare thing, but that still happens nonetheless) will be implicitly giving a new answer to this question. In fact, this is one question that should be allowed to be repeated here, from time to time, if we are not to become just a persistent quiz show. My bite is inspired by one of these books (Deleuze & Guattari's "What is Philosophy?"). Philosophy is about creating concepts. Creating concepts is obviously not the same as creating entries in a dictionary. It is also not what scientists do when they need a label to index some thing, to create consensus about some new observable or definable (yet never before observed, or defined) thing. Philosophy could be confused with poetry, then, but there is an important distinction, which is that a concept is not primarily about sensation, or about the memory of sensations. A concept is not about anything, it is that which is not about something else. To answer your question more directly, philosophers care about problems, not... questions. They'll obviously look for good problems, legitimate problems, problems that resist solution. They then explore these problems, and the trail of these explorations is the corpus of philosophical literature. So Philosophy is a process, but it does not necessarily advance towards a future state of "satisfaction" (answer). A philosophical problem is not a disease, that has to be cured. That these things exist, is what the Greeks discovered, thousands of years ago. 

Existence, for instance of a human being, need not be restricted to the material body. Also the influence exerted on the environment can be considered a part of their existence. A discussion with Conifold has made me think that there are at least three kinds of existence: (a) Material things like particles, substances, bodies, liquids, gases, creatures with or without labels or names stored in memories but exerting some physical influence on their environment. As an example the gravitational force of a body, the electromegnetic fileld of a particle, a picture of a human or a letter written by him/her belongs to his/her existence. (b) Ideas with representations like "electron" or "number three". Every electron and every triple are representations of these notions and belong to the existence of these notions. But also a picture or a symbol standing for them belong to their existence. (c) Ideas with only representations like unicorns. There are no material representations of unicorns but plenty of pictures. But there are also bones which (for instance by Leibniz) had been attributed to unicorns. And there are organic molecules which would belong to unicorns if they were bred. My question: Are there philosophers who have thought along these lines already? In particular have the influence exerted on the environment and the representation been considered part of existence? And if so, could the blurred border between (b) and (c) be cleared? 

In the biginning there was only energy / radiation. After 10^(-35) seconds quarks and leptons were formed. After 10^(-10) seconds protons and neutrons were formed. After 1 second hydrogen and and helium and perhaps a bit of lithium were formed and after 3 minutes the constitution of matter was finished (Steven Weinberg: The first three minutes). There were no heavy elements. in order to syntheticise heavier elements than iron you have to add energy. So these elements had to wait until in supernova explosions plenty of surplus energy was available. And in these furnaces there were also with certainty all elements like plutoniom and heavier formed that ever can be created by humans (and also elements like technetium that are missing (or seemed to be missing) in our terrestrial environment). Therefore the question "Are artificially synthesized chemical elements natural?" has to be answered by a clear yes. And finally: Since humans are as natural as supernovas, all they do is natural too. 

In this account, qualities of things do not stand on their own, and are also not memories of sensations, but are those elements of reality that can be traced back to sensations, but only as they are abstracted from them, and then rearranged in units of existence that we synthetically call objects of the world, thanks to the presence of signs of reality, which are paradoxically those that cannot be seen, or remembered, by themselves. Interestingly, it is exactly because they are not directly based on sensations that experiences can endure. It is because we have an involuntary (and largely unconscious) theory of reality that we can add coherence to our sensations. 

The thing is, one doesn't need to assume that these are different levels of abstraction, that are intrinsic to the thing being observed. As it happens, my nervous system is a computational machine, but in the same right it can be identified as a biological machine, a chemical machine, or a physical machine (in the specific sense of being describable using only concepts from the physical science). These different levels of observation belong to the mind that does the observation, not to the thing. Now, the crucial observation, one that Brian Cantwell Smith makes here, is that because there are machines that do computational things - possibly quite intelligent ones - the fact that these machines were created by humans does not entail that the final cause of those artifacts is known to those humans, or even controlled by them in any objective way. That's why you can say, quite confidently, that identification involves at least a choice of perspective. It is thus, at least primarily, in the eye of the beholder. 

Without science far less lives would have been possible. Of course all these will die again, but that cannot be blamed on science. Consider the development of mankind. Two thousand years ago there were about 200 million people. Now we are more than 7 billions. That would not have been possible without modern science in agriculture and medicine. It can be observed that always when the agricultural and medical technologies were improved, the population has grown (see the second diagram). Source de.Wikipedia. 

This is not a fallacy, it is clever behaviour. It can be observed frequently with politicians. I know of a very famous one who said in public: What should I bother about my yesterday prattle? Or look at the current US president who meanwhile turned many of his views by 180 degrees. The list of these examples could be extended infinitely. But in most cases the proponents are not as honest as that one of my first example. 

Amazingly (for me) the Golden Rule, as it seems, has always and ever been the same. In Germany it is taught as a well known rhyme: Was du nichts willst, dass man dir tu', das füg auch keinem andern zu. (What you don't want to suffer, you must not do to others.) In the following some excerpts from Wikipedia. 

So the belief in the axiom of choice is comparable with the belief in something that with absolute certainty cannot be accomplished, like the axiom: In Euclidean space a straight line can be found to cover every triple of points. The belief in this axiom is as justified as the belief in the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice would have been disposed of long ago - at least after Feferman's proof - but with it large parts of set theory would vanish - and that has to be prevented by all means. If you see only a 1 % chance for the existence of God, then I would strongly recommend to revise your point of view. The belief in God is overwhelmingly more reasonable than the belief in the axiom of choice. His existence has not yet been disproved. 

In defense of what is sometimes called "obscurantism", particularly in philosophy, it can be said that reason proceeds sometimes by disruption, radical irreverence, noise. It is easy to see that not all said obscurantists are of the same caliber. The same can be said of the defenders of clarity. That said, this is not what the authors you collectively refer to as "postmodern" (a denomination that is, itself, quite... obscuring), particularly Baudrillard, are advancing in their work. They are writing at a time when their readership has largely assumed that consensus in philosophy has already failed as a project, so it can be said that criticism of their work as "hard to read" largely misses the point. Poetry was never a stranger to philosophical thinking. 

In many, many works in linguistics, psychology, cognitive science, philosophy, and obviously in most of what is applied computer science, a more or less conscious leap is made from thought-meaning-behavior... to computable to Turing-computable. It is to this last step that I am referring in this question. This way of thinking, while not necessarily reflective of our better understanding, still enjoys significant popularity within the scientific community (and yes, this is just my perception). The Church-Turing's thesis, not being entirely objective, can still be debated, objected to, even discredited and eventually considered useless (which I believe is what is going to happen, some day), but not strictly falsified. 

I do not dispute Conifold's answer, but would like to add a different perspective. As I see it, and according to what could be understood as a fundamental tenet of structuralist and post-structuralist conceptions of language, it is not just that what constitutes language is how people speak, but also that the human condition itself is created in and through speech. What still intrigues me about your question is the conjugation of objectivity and independence of manifestation. As was conjectured by the comment from David H, only in pure mathematical terms can these two demands be met. In other words, "facts or features of language that exist independent of anyone's actual speech" are a matter of logic, or, if you include virtual manifestations of language (as Peirce has proposed) of theoretical semiotics. In any case, linguistic realism is perfectly compatible with an empirical study of language, it actually would benefit greatly from the absence of Plato from the scene. 

If God exists and if Cantor is right, then God cannot know every real number, because there are uncountably many and hence there is no memory that can store and no intelligence that can define all. God would be overtaxed in the same way as when he had to name an even prime number beyond 2. This means, under the given constraints, God would know that he does not know everything. 

Probably no. The proton decay, not yet proven but rather probable, will destroy all structures of atoms, i.e., of what we call matter. There will remain particles like leptons and structures like positron-electron pairs. 

Some of the most prominent supporters of a recommendation of Adolf Hitler are: Eugen Fischer, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Martin Heidegger, Emanuel Hirsch, Wilhelm Pinder, Ferdinand Sauerbruch, Eberhard Schmidt, Friedrich Karl Schumann. A rather complete list of the signatories including many famous philosophers and mathematicians can be found here 

"Mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging." This sentence is pure religion or "matheology". Everything that can interact with part of reality (like a brain or a computer memory) has spatio-temporal properties. This is true for every philosophical variety including Platonism. A simple example: The number 3 has lots of representations, for instance one on this screen, another one in the holy trinity. (Without any representation the number 3 could not appear in mathematical discourse and therefore would not exist in mathematics as far as mathematics is accessible to mathematicians.) Every representation is therefore an important part of this number 3. We can say the number consists of a value and its representations, some of which may be as feeble as chemo-electrical processes in a brain. And every representations covers spatio-temporal co-ordinates. Further every variable is a mathematical entity. As its name says, a variable can vary in value or other properties. A math book is certainly a mathematical entity. It can vary by writing notes into the book and by having new editions. A rope or its shape is a mathematical entity. Both can vary. The representation of a number is a mathematical entity. It can vary according to the system where it is expressed. With respect to eternity, there are differing opinions. Those Platonists who believe with Cantor that God has created the numbers will insist that they are eternal. There are others however, who accept Dedekind's standpoint: "Every time when there is a cut (A1, A2) which is not created by a rational number, we create a new, an irrational number a which we consider to be completely defined by this cut (A1, A2)". They will not believe in eternal numbers, because "we" can't have created numbers more than some millenia ago.
