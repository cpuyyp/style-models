Finite, surjective, and unramified does not imply etale. E.g. suppose that $Y$ is a proper closed subscheme of $X$, and we consider the map $X \coprod Y \to X$ defined as the disjoint union of the identity on $X$, and the given closed immersion $Y \to X$ on $Y$. Then this map is finite, unramified, and surjective, but not etale. (See Sandor's answer for the missing condition, which is flatness!) Added: A more interesting example is given by letting $X$ be a nodal cubic, letting $\tilde{X}$ be the normalization, and considering the natural map $\tilde{X} \to X.$ This map is not flat and certainly not etale, but it is unramified. (Formally, each branch through the node maps by a closed immersion into the nodal curve.) 

Let me give an answer in the opposite direction of the ones already given. It may that be you can't get a precise classification, but nevertheless, you can say something, and it may be enough for the situation you are considering, or at least helpful. Let's suppose first that your module $M$ is torsion; then it is a product of its $p$-power torsion parts for each prime $p$, so you an suppose it is $p$-power torsion. It is then a module over $\mathbb Z_p[G]$. You may write $G$ as a product $G_1\times G_2,$ where $G_1$ is of prime-to-$p$ order and $G_2$ is of $p$-power order. The group ring $\mathbb F_p[G_1]$ is a product of finite fields $k$, and the ring $\mathbb Z_p[G_1]$ is isomorphic to a corresponding product of rings of Witt vectors $W(k)$. So one is left with $p$-power torsion modules over $W(k)[G_2]$. This may be something of a mess, but one can say something: for example, any Jordan--H\"older factor of such a module is the trivial representation of $G_2$ over $k$, and so your module is a successive extension of copies of the trivial representation. Now suppose that you have an $M$ which is not necessarily torsion. Then one can consider the map $M \to \mathbb Q\otimes_{\mathbb Z} M$. The kernel is torsion, and so one can get some handle on its structure as above. The image is a $G$-invariant lattice in the $G$-representation $\mathbb Q \otimes_{\mathbb Z} M.$ The possibilities for this latter representation (of $\mathbb Q$ over $G$) can be described pretty easily, since $\mathbb Q[G]$ is just a product of fields $K$; it will break up into a product of copies of these various fields $K$. The biggest complication with the image of $M$ is that it typically won't break up as a product. A useful way to think is to consider Spec $\mathbb Z[G]$, which is an affine scheme mapping finitely to Spec $\mathbb Z$, and then to think of $M$ as quasi-coherent sheaf over Spec $\mathbb Z[G]$. Then tensoring with $\mathbb Q$ corresponds to looking at this sheaf at the generic points; looking at the torsion part of $M$ corresponds to looking at sections supported at closed points; and the possible failure of $M$ to decompose as a product corresponds to the fact that although Spec $\mathbb Z[G]$ will have several irreducible components (if $G$ is non-trivial) --- these correspond to the various factors in the decomposition of $\mathbb Q[G]$ into a product of fields --- it will be connected (the components meet at various closed points, corresponding to the primes dividing the order of $G$). Number theorists frequently work with rings like $\mathbb Z[G]$, and modules over them. Depending on what you want to do, it is not necessary to have a complete classification; a somewhat coarser understanding of the type described above can be quite useful by itself. 

Let me sketch a proof of the result (which I would guess is the one Lang gives) with some motivation that I hope resonates with your question. There is a general adjunction, if $A \to B$ is a ring homomorphism and $M$ and $N$ are $A$- and $B$-modules respectively, of the form $Hom_A(N,M) = Hom_B(N,Hom_A(B,M)).$ This shows that if $M$ is injective over $A$, then $Hom_A(B,M)$ is injective as a $B$-module, and also that if $N \hookrightarrow M$ is an embedding of $A$-modules, then the induced map $N \to Hom_A(B,M)$ is also an embedding. Thus it suffices to construct enough injectives in the category of $\mathbb Z$-modules; the above considerations then produce enough injectives for modules over any ring. Now $I$ is injective if and only if $Hom(\text{--},I)$ is exact, which is already a kind of Pontrjagin duality property: it gives an exact functor reversing arrows. Furthermore, we always have a double duality map $M \to Hom(Hom(M,I))$, and another feature of Pontrjagin duality is that this map should be an isomorphism. Let's here consider the weaker property that it is injective (so we at least have a non-degenarate duality, although not necessarily perfect). Suppose then that $I$ is some injective module over $\mathbb Z$, with the property that the double duality map $M \to Hom(Hom(M,I),I)$ is injective for all $M$ (i.e. with the property that it gives rise to some kind of Pontrjagin duality). Then given this $I$, if we take a free module surjecting onto $Hom(M,I),$ and then apply $Hom(\text{--},I)$ and compose with the double duality map, we get an embedding from $M$ into a product of copies of $I$, and hence an embedding of $M$ into an injective. Thus constructing enough injectives is reduced to finding such $I$, and here we are guided by the idea that we are looking for an object that establishes some kind of (at least weak form of) Pontrjagin duality. Now in order for the double duality to be injective, one needs that for any $m \in M$, there is a map from $\langle m \rangle$ to $I$ that is non-zero on $m$ (since this will extend to all of $M$ by injectivity of $I$). So we need $I$ to be injective, i.e. divisible, and to contain torsion elements of arbitrary order. Thus we could take $I = {\mathbb Q}/{\mathbb Z}$, as in Lang, or also the circle group $S^1$. (But the latter has infinite order elements which are not necessary, so ${\mathbb Q}/{\mathbb Z}$ is more economical. Since it also has a more algebraic/less analytic feel than the circle, this is probably why it is more commonly used in such arguments.) 

There is a paper of Ogus for 1975, "The cohomology of the infinitesimal site", in which he shows that if $X$ is proper over an algebraically closed field $k$ of char. $p$, and embeds into a smooth scheme over $k$, then the infinitesimal cohomology of $X$ coincides with etale cohomology with coefficients in $k$ (or more generally $W_n(k)$ if we work with the infinitesimal site of $X$ over $W_n(k)$). Note that, since $k$ has char. $p$, we are talking about etale cohomology with mod $p^n$ coefficients, so this is "smaller" than the usual etale cohomology; it just picks up the "unit roots" of Frobenius. So the infinitesimal cohomology gives the unit root part of the crystalline cohomology. 

Probably you know this, but just to be sure: they receive cycle class maps from codimension $k$ cycles. More precisely, if $Z$ is a cycle on $X$ of codimension $k$ that is cohomologically trivial, then it gives an element in $J^k(X)$. This map, from cohomologically trivial cycles to $J^k(X)$, is a (generalized) Abel-Jacobia map. If we let $CH^k(X)$ be the Chow group of codimension $k$ cycles on $X$, then we get a filtration on $CH^k(X)$, namely $CH^k(X) \supset \text{ cohomologically trivial cycles} \supset \text{ Albanese trivial cycles}.$ (Albanese trivial means "has trivial image in $J^k(X)$.) It is conjectured that this filtration can be further extended; this is part of the Bloch--Beilinson series of conjectures on Chow groups and motives. On the other other hand, if $X$ is defined over a number field $K$, and we look just at cycles defined over $K$, then it is conjectured that Albanese trivial implies rationally trivial (i.e. any cohomologically trivial cycle that is also is in the kernel of themap to $J^k(X)$ (and is defined over a number field ) is in fact rationally equivalent to zero). I believe this conjecture is extremely wide open at the moment. 

Dear Kwan, Let $N$ be the submodule of $M$ generated by $S$. Then by assumption $M = N +\mathfrak m M.$ Iterating this, we find that $$M = N + \mathfrak m (N + \mathfrak m M) = N + \mathfrak m^2 M = \cdots = N + \mathfrak m^n M$$ for any $n > 0.$ If we take $n$ large enough then $\mathfrak m^n = 0$ (by hypothesis). Thus $M = N,$ as desired. P.S. I've found this to be quite a useful fact! 

A motive is a chunk of a variety cut out by correspondences. (If you like, it is something of which we can take cohomology.) Artin motives are what one gets by restricting to zero-dimensional varieties. If the ground field is algebraically closed then zero-dimensional varieties are simply finite unions of points, so there is not much to say; the only invariant is the number of points. But if the ground field $K$ is not algebraically closed (but is perfect, e.g. char $0$, so that we can describe all finite extensions by Galois theory), then there are many interesting $0$-dimensional motives, and in fact the category of Artin motives (with coefficients in a field $F$ of characteristic $0$, say) is equal to the category of continuous representations of $Gal(\overline{K}/K)$ on $F$-vector spaces (where the $F$-vector spaces are given their discrete topoogy; in other words, the representation must factor through $Gal(E/K)$ for some finite extension $E$ of $K$). Perhaps from a geometric perspective, these motives seem less interesting than others. On the other hand, number theoretically, they are very challenging to understand. The Artin conjecture about the holomorphicity of $L$-functions of Artin motives, which is the basic reciprocity conjecture regarding such motives, remains very wide open, with very few non-abelian cases known. (Of course, for representations with abelian image, these conjectures amount to class field theory, which is already quite non-trivial.) 

If you haven't, you should first think about these questions just for modular curves, which are the simplest Shimura varieties. Then there are only finitely many $N$ for which the modular curve of level $N$ has genus $< 2$. Once the genus is at least $2$, there are only finitely many points over any fixed number field (by Mordell's conjecture/Faltings theorem). For higher dimensional Shimura varieties, once the level gets large enough the variety will become of general type, and Lang's conjecture will (presumably) apply, so as to give restrictions on the rational points. In particular, the answer to (ii) will presumably be never if the level is large enough. The $\overline{\mathbb Q}$-points are Zariski dense by the Nullstellensatz, and most of them won't be CM points (unless the Shimura variety is associated to a torus, so that every point is CM!), so eventually (i.e. if you make $k$ large enough) you will get points that are not CM. 

There is another way to think about this question, which is not typically how people learned it when I was a student, but might be a better way to proceed nowadays. Namely, $J_0(N)$ or $J_1(N)$ is (up to isogeny) a product of abelian varieties $A_f$ attached to Hecke eigenforms $A_f$. Now the reduction of $A_f$ is (more-or-less) determined by the amount of ramification at $p$ in the $\ell$-adic Tate module of $A_f$, which is to say, in the ramification at $p$ of the $\ell$-adic Galois representation $\rho_f$ attached to $f$. (Here $\ell$ can be any prime distinct from $p$.) Now the restriction to a decomposition group at $p$ of $\rho_f$, and so, in particular, the ramification at $p$ in $\rho_f$, is determined by the the local factor at $p$ of the automorphic representation generated by $f$. (This is the celebrated local-global compatibility theorem of Langlands--Deligne--Carayol.) This local factor encodes information such as the power of $p$ dividing the level of $f$ and the eigenvalue of $U_p$ acting on $f$ (but in general it contains more information than just these facts). A typical concrete consequence of this analysis is that if $p$ is prime to $N$, and if we write $J_1(N;p)$ to denote the Jacobian of the modular curve of level $\Gamma_1(N)\cap \Gamma_0(p)$, then $J_1(Np)/J_1(N;p)$ has good reduction over $\mathbb Q_p(\mu_p)$. 

Not knowing anything else about your situation, the approach that comes to mind is to use the long exact sequence: $$\cdots \to H^i_Z(\overline{X},\mathcal O_{\overline{X}}) \to H^i(\overline{X}, \mathcal O_{\overline{X}}) \to H^i(X,\mathcal O_X) \to \cdots $$ (described somewhere in a Hartshorne exercise). This requires knowing the local cohomology $H^i_Z(\overline{X},\mathcal O_{\overline{X}})$, which you can hopefully get a handle on, if you know enough about $Z$ and its embedding in $\overline{X}$. 

A slightly more theoretical answer: there is an algorithm of Tate, called (unremarkably) Tate's algorithm, which allows one to compute the minimal model over any local field. I have a vague memory that it's not proved that this algorithm terminates in general, although it is expected to. (Perhaps someone else can say something definitive about this.) I would guess that this is what is implemented in Pari. 

Look at Def. 4.7 of Deligne--Mumford for the definition when $X$ is DM: they define $X$ to be separated if $X \to X \times X$ is proper (or equivalently, finite). 

As far as I can tell, the Galois action that you assert exists doesn't in fact exist. First of all, to define the motivic Galois group, you have to choose a realization; it seems that you are choosing the Betti realization, so the motivic Galois group is a pro-algebraic group $G$ over $\mathbb Q$ which acts on $H^i(X(\mathbb C),\mathbb Q)$ for every smooth projective variety $X$ over $\mathbb K$. If we consider the $\mathbb Q_{\ell}$ points of $G$, then we get a map $\rho_{\ell}:Gal(\overline{K}/K) \to G(\mathbb Q_{\ell})$, corresponding precisely to the Galois action on $\ell$-adic cohomology (and using the canonical isomorphism of $\ell$-adic cohomology with $H^i(X(\mathbb C),\mathbb Q_{\ell})$). This just encodes Galois actions on $\ell$-adic cohomology, by its construction. There is also a map of pro-algebraic groups $G \to Gal(\overline{K}/K)$, given by the action of $G$ on $H^0$s. (This is the map that Donu refers to in his comment.) The maps $\rho_{\ell}$ are sections to this map (after passing to $\mathbb Q_{\ell}$-valued points), again by construction. There is nothing in this formalism (and it is just formalism) which suggests a natural action of the Galois group on $H^i(X(\mathbb C),\mathbb Q)$ for $i > 0$.
