Here is one additional data point. The standard reference for symmetric function is Macdonald's "Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials". Most of the content of this book is in the exercises; each section of the book contains many pages of useful results and formulas stated without proof. According to Google Scholar, this book has been cited 7735 times, and it seems likely that many (most?) of these citations are references to exercises in the book. 

The short answer is no. The best you can say is the following: there is a functor rat from mixed Hodge modules to perverse sheaves, and for smooth $X$, $\mathrm{rat}(\mathscr M)$ is a local system iff $\mathscr M$ is smooth. But a smooth mixed Hodge module contains more information than its underlying local system (think about the case when $X$ is a point!). The precise extra data you need on a local system to define a mixed Hodge module is that of an admissible variation of mixed Hodge structure, see Steenbrink and Zucker: Variation of mixed Hodge structure I. Edit: On second thought, maybe I want to change my answer in a different direction. The category of smooth mixed Hodge modules on $X$ is neutral tannakian, with the basepoint you wisely fixed providing the fiber functor. Then such mixed Hodge modules are in fact the same as representations of some horribly complicated pro-algebraic group. Maybe this is not the kind of answer you were after, but there it is. 

The cotangent bundle of $\overline M_{g,n}$ is never ample. You can see this for instance by restricting it to the hyperelliptic locus. There has been a lot of work in the last 5-10 years on running the (log) minimal model program on the moduli space of curves. You can read about this to get a feeling for how far from true it is that $K_{\overline M_{g,n}}$ is ample. There's a survey of Fedorchuk-Smyth in the Handbook of Moduli, for instance. 

$\newcommand{\p}{\mathcal{P}}$Let G be a group, and let $G_n$ denote the wreath product $G^n \rtimes \Sigma_n$. There seems to be a notion of a PROP $\p$ where the role of the symmetric groups $\Sigma_n$ is instead played by the groups $G_n$. An example would be $G=SO(N)$ and $\p$ the PROP associated to the framed little N-disc operad. Here $\p(1,n)$ has an action of $G_1^{op} \times G_n$ -- the copy of $G_1^{op}$ rotates the entire disc "counterclockwise" (i.e. an element $g \in SO(N)$ acts via $g^{-1}$), and the action of $G_n$ on $\p(1,n)$ is the evident one. The gluing maps are then suitably equivariant under this simultaneous action of $G$ on the input/output legs, so to speak. Is there a standard name for this kind of PROP/operad? Cf. how one calls an operad where $\Sigma_n$ has been replaced by $B_n$ a braided operad. I would also be happy to hear of any paper where this kind of gadget has been defined and/or studied. 

The coefficients of these polynomials are top intersection numbers of psi-classes and the class $\kappa_1$ on $\overline M_{g,n}$. That's how Mirzakhani obtained a new proof of the Witten conjecture, by studying the leading coefficients. The constant term is the top intersection number of $\kappa_1$. Carel Faber has written MAPLE program for computing top intersection numbers in the tautological ring, and in particular all these coefficients. $URL$ 

The answer is no, it is not smooth for any $g \geq 2$. For $g \geq 3$ the singular locus is precisely the locus of PPAVs with automorphism group greater than $\pm \mathrm{id}$, as proven in Oort, Frans: "Singularities of coarse moduli schemes". For $g=2$ there is IIRC a unique singular point which is in $M_2$ (the open subvariety of $A_2$ of Jacobians), I think this is in Igusa's paper "Arithmetic variety of moduli for genus two". 

Yes: there are generically two choices when lifting a point on the rational curve to the genus two curve. But the two choices are interchanged by the hyperelliptic involution, and Jim only claims an isomorphism of coarse moduli spaces. 

I think Alex is using some terminology from moduli spaces without mentioning it and that the question should be interpreted as follows. We are interested in counting trees such that each internal vertex has degree at least three. A "marked point" on the graph means an extremal vertex. The marked points should be labeled, but the internal vertices are not. Finally we assign a weight to each internal vertex by $(\mathrm{valence} - 3)!$ and take the product of all weights. For example when $N=5$: 

The argument given in Elkik, Le théorème de Manin-Drinfelʹd, seems to generalize also to nontrivial coefficient systems. The "usual" Manin-Drinfel'd theorem claims that the difference of two cusps has finite order in the Jacobian of the modular curve. Elkik reformulates this as asserting that the mixed Hodge structure on $H^1$ of the open modular curve is the direct sum of pure Hodge structures. It is this fact that she then proves by realizing the weight spaces as eigenspaces for the action of the Hecke operators. 

I am asking this question on behalf of a senior faculty member who is sometimes intimidated by computers. It is motivated by a problem in invariant theory. Unfortunately the question is a bit vague. 

This should fail already in the simplest case when $X = \mathbb A^1$ and $U$ is the complement of a point. Namely, the trivial local system on $U$ and the point admits several different gluings to a perverse sheaf on $X$. The precise gluing data you need is explained in Beilinson's "Gluing perverse sheaves", see also $URL$ 

If $S \colon \mathcal A \to \mathcal B$ is a functor, let $\newcommand{\op}{\mathrm{op}}S^\op \colon \mathcal A^\op \to \mathcal B^\op$ be its opposite. Then $(S \downarrow T)^\op \cong T^\op \downarrow S^\op$. Combine this with the equality $NF = NF^\op$ (if you identify $N\mathcal C = N\mathcal C^\op$, etc.) 

To add to Aşağı Güzdək's nice answer, there is something you can do also when the genus is greater than zero which is also in some sense an exact formula. Namely, if $\Gamma$ is one of $\Gamma_0(N), \Gamma_1(N)$ or $\Gamma(N)$ [or probably some other congruence subgroups as well, but I am not familiar with this story], and $Y_\Gamma$ (resp. $X_\Gamma$) is the corresponding open (resp. compact) modular curve, then one has $$ |Y_\Gamma(\mathbf{F}_p)| = p+1-\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{Frob}_p|E_2(\Gamma))-\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{Frob}_p|S_2(\Gamma)),$$ where $E_k(\Gamma)$ (resp. $S_k(\Gamma)$) is the Galois representation attached to Eisenstein series (resp. cusp forms) of weight $k$ for $\Gamma$. The Galois representation $E_2(\Gamma)$ is given by the $\ell$-adic cohomology of $X^\infty_\Gamma = X_\Gamma \setminus Y_\Gamma$, hence the appearance of the number of cusps in the previous answer. In general one can for a given $\Gamma$ and p figure out which of the cusps are defined over what fields by looking explicitly at the modular interpretation of $X_\Gamma^\infty$ described in the paper by Deligne & Rapoport. The trace of Frobenius on the space of cusp forms is the really interesting one. In many cases this can be computed for a given $\Gamma$ and $p$ by looking in tables like the Modular Forms Database of William Stein, or asking SAGE to spit them out for you (see e.g. $URL$ -- for a prime p, the trace of $\mathrm{Frob_p}$ coincides with the trace of the Hecke operator $T_p$, which can be read off from the pth Fourier coefficients of a basis of normalized eigenforms for the space of cusp forms you are looking at. It seems the only built-in functionality in SAGE is for the groups $\Gamma_0(N)$ and $\Gamma_1(N)$. But perhaps one can still do something for small N, e.g. using that conjugation by the matrix with entries $(0,-1;N,0)$ takes $\Gamma(N)$ to $\Gamma_0(N^2) \cap \Gamma_1(N)$ -- this tells you how to get cusp forms for $\Gamma(N)$ both from $\Gamma_0(N^2)$ and $\Gamma_1(N)$, and by the genus formula for $\Gamma(N)$ you can tell if this has produced all of them. 

As Matthias Wendt says, the general problem is hard. However, if $K$ has characteristic zero, the problem is completely solved by Sullivan's approach to rational homotopy theory: such a topological space always exists. See his paper "Infinitesimal computations in topology". Briefly you should take your algebra $S$, consider it as a commutative differential graded algebra and choose a cofibrant replacement, i.e. a Sullivan model. Then plug this model into the "spatial realization" functor to get a topological space whose Sullivan cochains are quasi-isomorphic to the algebra you started with. In particular the cohomology ring of this space is $S$. This would work more generally also if $S$ had elements of odd degree - but for simplicity I think you should assume that it vanishes in degree one. 

A general point on $D_1 \cap D_2$ is given by smoothing the third node, which produces an irreducible curve with two nodes. 

I'm far from an expert, but here is a comment. In the case of a Shimura variety, the Matsushima-Murakami formula and the (proof of the) Zucker conjecture shows that cohomological representations are precisely the ones that contribute to the intersection cohomology of the Shimura variety with coefficients in some local system. This "piece" of the intersection cohomology is a candidate for a compatible system of $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to the representation (or a "motive"). Thus cohomological representations are precisely the ones for which Deligne's original construction of Galois representations attached to Hecke eigenforms of weight $\geq 2$ could be optimistically hoped to generalize. For instance, Weissauer has constructed 4-dimensional Galois representations attached to Siegel cusp forms of genus 2 in the cohomological case, using this strategy. But e.g. for the interesting case of Siegel cusp forms of weight $(2,2)$, which are expected to have Galois representations given by $H^1$ of an abelian surface, such a construction is wide open. 

If $U$ is a smooth algebraic variety, then one can give a simple description of the lowest weight part of its cohomology: if $X$ is a smooth compactification and $j \colon U \to X$ the inclusion, then $$ W_k H^k(U,\mathbf Q) = \mathrm{Im} \left( j^\ast \colon H^k(X,\mathbf Q) \to H^k(U,\mathbf Q)\right). $$ Is there a similar direct description of the second lowest weight part, i.e. $$ \mathrm{Gr}^W_{k+1} H^k(U,\mathbf Q)?$$ 

Hi Peter! I just checked in Mumford's book and there is an assumption in the theorem that G acts freely. If you don't assume this, it might be easier to instead work with the stack quotient $[X/G]$. Then the statement you are trying to show fits into the general framework of descent along torsors. See for instance Vistoli's notes from Fundamental algebraic geometry for a nice treatment. All of this amounts to a very general set-up for showing that G-equivariant sheaves on X are equivalent to sheaves on the quotient. This will for instance work for locally constant sheaves in the étale topology. Maybe you can also do it directly without invoking any general theory by imitating Mumford's proof: he passes to a completion to assume that the covering is trivial, but it seems that you could take an étale cover instead. Depending on what you want to do with your sheaf, having a sheaf on the quotient stack might be just as good as having a sheaf on the scheme quotient. For instance, if you want to compute its cohomology you can apply Leray to the projection to the coarse moduli space. In any nice situation all higher derived functors of the pushforward will vanish so you get the cohomology on the scheme quotient as well. Hope this helps. 

It's well known that chain complexes are an abelian category, and in particular we can consider chain complexes of chain complexes, i.e. double complexes. Given a double complex $A^{\bullet\bullet} \in \mathrm{Kom}(\mathrm{Kom}(\mathcal A))$ we can form the total complex $\newcommand{\tot}{\mathrm{Tot}}\tot(A^{\bullet\bullet})$ which now lies "one level lower", in $\mathrm{Kom}(\mathcal A)$. I can also try to consider chain complexes in the derived category of $\mathcal A$, but it is no longer clear (at least to me) how to build a total complex in the best way, since $d \circ d=0$ only has to hold up to homotopy in $D(\mathcal A)$. But let me now consider more generally a triangulated category $\newcommand{\T}{\mathcal T}\T$ and a sequence of objects $A^0, \ldots, A^n$ with $d_i \colon A^i \to A^{i+1}$ such that $d_{i+1} \circ d_i = 0$. It seems to me that one can define a total complex $\tot(A^\bullet) \in \T$ as an iterated mapping cone: for instance, if $n=2$, then one can first consider $B = \mathrm{Cone}(d_0)$. Then we consider the diagram $$ \begin{matrix} A^0 & \to & A^1 & \to & B \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow & & \\ 0 & \to & A^2 & \to & A^2 & \end{matrix}$$ where both rows are distinguished triangles; by one of the axioms of triangulated categories there is a map $f \colon B \to A^2$ completing this to a map of triangles, and we define $\tot(A^\bullet)=\mathrm{Cone}(f)$. However, this has a the drawback of not being functorial. For instance, I think that one would like to say that a map $A^\bullet \to B^\bullet$ of chain complexes in $\T$ is a quasi-isomorphism if $\tot(A^\bullet) \to \tot(B^\bullet)$ is an isomorphism, but this makes no sense unless $\tot$ is a functor. And one would like to say that if $f \colon \T \to \T'$ is a triangulated functor, then there is a natural equivalence between $f \circ \tot$ and $\tot \circ f$ as functors $\mathrm{Kom}(\T) \to \T'$ (am I right?), and again $\tot$ needs to be functorial. First of all, I would like to know if what I've said so far is correct. Maybe there is a better way to set things up than this? Secondly, I've heard the slogan that stable $\infty$-categories solve all problems arising from the fact that triangulated categories don't have functorial mapping cones. Is there a better behaved notion of a chain complex in a stable $\infty$-category? I suspect that I could answer these questions myself if I started reading Lurie's work, but it's a slightly intimidating amount of text and I thought I'd ask here first. 

The easiest definition is via the Pontrjagin--Thom construction (I think). Let $N$ be a tubular neighbourhood of $Y$, isomorphic to the normal bundle. Let $X'$ be the space obtained from $X$ by collapsing the complement of $N$ to a point. Then $X'$ is isomorphic to the Thom space of the normal bundle, and if the normal bundle is oriented then there is the Thom isomorphism: $$ H^\bullet(Y,\mathbf Z) \cong H^{\bullet+\dim X - \dim Y}(X',\mathbf Z).$$ Composing with the natural $H^\bullet(X',\mathbf Z) \to H^\bullet(X, \mathbf Z)$ gives the map you want. 

No, this is false in general. I quote the Mathematical Review of Dade, Everett C. Localization of injective modules. J. Algebra 69 (1981), no. 2, 416–425. 

(Quoted from GIT) The most important work in this area is the slightly intimidating GIT (Geometric Invariant Theory) by David Mumford. The main construction of the book shows that when the group is reductive and acts linearly on a projective variety $X$, there are canonically defined open dense subsets traditionally denotes $X^s$ and $X^{ss}$ such that the $X^s$ has a geometric quotient and $X^{ss}$ has a good quotient which is projective. When X is not projective one has to work with so called L-linear actions where L is a line bundle on X. This reduces to the case X projective by taking $L = O(1)$. GIT is written like a textbook so in principle you can start reading on page one, but there are friendlier introductions out there. I like Dolgachev's Lectures on Invariant Theory. 

A general form of Lefschetz duality is that if $X$ is a compact topological space, $A \subset X$ is a closed subset (which needs some very mild point-set assumptions, maybe a neighborhood retract or something), and $X \setminus A$ is an oriented $n$-manifold, then $$ H^k(X,A) \cong H_{n-k}(X \setminus A).$$ I find it easiest to think of this as the conjunction of two assertions: firstly that $H^k(X,A) \cong H^k_c(X \setminus A)$, which is an isomorphism having nothing to do with manifolds: for any "reasonable" topological space, compact support cohomology can be defined as relative cohomology for an arbitrary compactification. Secondly, Poincaré duality on an oriented manifold, in the form of an isomorphism between homology and compact support cohomology. The dual form of Lefschetz duality $H_k(X,A) \cong H^{n-k}(X \setminus A)$ can be understood similarly in terms of Borel--Moore homology. 

This result can also be found as Theorem 3.3.9 in Ginzburg-Kapranov: "Koszul duality for operads" (Duke Math J 1994). Set $r=1$ in their result and rescale so that $a_1=1$. They had discovered it independently, but thank D. Wright for informing them that the result was known before due to J. Towber. They also give a reference to Wright: "The tree formulas for reversion of power series" (JPAA 1989), where this result appears as Theorem 3.10. The context of this result in the setting of operads is that any dg operad $P = \{P(n)\}$, say with $P(0)=0$ and $P(1)$ a copy of the base field, has a generating series which encodes the Euler characteristics of the chain complexes $P(n)$. The generating series of $P$ is the compositional inverse of the generating series for the "bar construction" on the operad $P$. The bar construction of operads is defined by a sum over trees whose internal vertices are decorated by the chain complexes of the operad $P$; in fact, the trees involved are exactly those that you call phylogenetic trees.
