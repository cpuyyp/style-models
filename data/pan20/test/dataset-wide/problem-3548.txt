If you need to improve off the floor, rack pulls definitely help when you set the height just below the knee. Using chains, bands & other tools can definitely help as well. As Berin mentioned, taking a video would definitely give some more visual as to how you are pulling. 

This is a matter of personal preference but I train without a belt on lighter sets and use one on heavier sets. Most lifters tend to use belts all the time, everytime. That ends up lessening core strength due to over-reliance on the belt. If your core is weak, I would advise to train without it and start implementing more core work to build up a stronger base. 

What grip style are you using? I would focus on grip training and avoid using any straps, they hinder grip development. For grip training, I would include pull-up bar hangs, heavy farmer walks, plate pinches, standard barbell training using thicker barbells. If your gym doesn't have thicker barbells, try wrapping a towel around it, squat pads or even using something like Fat Gripz. 

The only thing I have been able to find is that the squat depth could affect your vertical jump ability - but I have no idea if you even remotely care about that. Anyway, this study ($URL$ proved that parallel squat has a higher postactivation potentiation (PAP) than a quarter squat - meaning that less-than-parallel squats could negatively affect your vertical jumping ability. And while the study did prove a significant advantage of doing parallel squats when they are done right before preforming the jumps - the evidence on long term connection between PAP and enhanced athletic performance seems to be limited ($URL$ 

You basically fast, except you only get in around 1.2-1.4 gm of protein per kilogram of your "ideal body weight" ($URL$ This is called protein sparing modified fasting and it represents the fastest science-backed method that allows you to reach high fat burn rates without causing major destruction of your muscle mass (apart from what you'll lose from being inactive). You avoid any cardio exercise (strength training could help you out even under "fasting" conditions, but that's a story for another day), because every hour of exercise in a glycogen deprived state can destroy upwards of 100 grams of your lean body mass (at least according to this nitrogen balance study: $URL$ 

In both cases West-to-East and East-to-West jet lag does apply (not north and south / south and north). Basically your body and brain are completely out of sync due to the departure time and arrival time when travelling through different time zones. I strongly suggest arriving a few days (atleast 3, some people prefer 1 week) earlier before your marathon. This will get your body adjusted to sleeping at the correct American / European times respectively. 

I have used C4 quite a bit along side with Creatine as well. Depending on your creatine, C4 won't be giving you that much creatine (I believe it was 1g per scoop). Some people claimed creatine needed a "loading phase" but that hasn't been proven. In fact, the "loading phase" was popularized by companies who wanted to sell more of their product. They would suggest a loading phase and the consumer would be using more during the first weeks (without any added results). 

Before training (age 18) I was a scrawny 18 year old. My friends were for the most part, the same age as me. It was very intimidating for me to start training (being very weak) with my best buddies who have been working out for 2 years and getting a nice physique as well as strength. It was very hard for my ego, this can be different for each person. Of course, when I did start, they were very helpful (as anyone would be) and added just the right amount of teasing to push me harder. Important note: I started seriously when I was out there to prove to myself what I could acheive and not to my friends. This is often the cause for people quitting working out. Now I encourage everyone I can if they have the will power. This is a key factor because not everyone will start with the same motivation. You almost can't make someone start at the same level of intensity as you (unless they have a huge ego). Many people will be discouraged before they even start to see results. For added motivation, I suggest everyone I know to take progress pictures so that they can really see their achievement. This helps them stay motivated and push even harder. 

Ok, that's it. I've read about how dehydration can "slow down" our metabolism one time too many, so I decided to conduct my own research - and find out once and for all, whether or not that's just another one of the many weight loss myths in existence. If you do a quick search on Google, you can find plenty of weight loss articles explaining how proper hydration of the body is a must - which is something I definitely agree with for health reasons - but when it comes to the effect of dehydration on our energy expenditure, I have yet to find any scientific proof that dehydration does indeed cause our bodies to start burning less calories. I will keep searching for conclusive evidence, but in the meanwhile, I'd like to ask all the incredibly smart people here if one of you already knows the answer to my burning question (pun intended)? 

I'd definitely need to read the whole article to be 100% this proves bigger muscles are more resistant to stretching, but judging only from the abstract of this review ($URL$ this seems to be the case: "...passive extensibility is influenced by the size (mass) and length of muscle fibers...resistance to passive lengthening is influenced by the readily adaptable amount of muscle tissue..." 

Agree 100% on the answers above. Number one issue I definitely face is sweating palms & hands in general. This can definitely put your grip in a compromised situation when you are looking to pull an illusive 500 lb deadlift. One thing to also implement as mentioned already is to avoid straps. Straps limit your grip strength if you become to over-reliant on them. Start incorporating more grip training like using those nutcracker devices, heavy farmer walks and deadlifts without straps, pull-up bar hangs and also plate pinches. You can use thicker bars or if your gym doesn't have one, use those squat pads around the bar or even a towel. Fat gripz is another tool which pretty much accomplishes the same thing. 

If you having sticking points, do what Greg suggested. Working on getting the lower back stronger and overall core. Otherwise, you are just setting yourself up for disaster on that. Implement more heavy bar holds without straps and some specialized grip training. You can try wrapping a towel, squat pad or anything that can increase the thickness of the bar to get some good grip training in. 

Measure the circumference of your waist at a horizontal level around the navel for men, and at the level with the least width for women. Don't pull your stomach in. Measure the circumference of the neck. Start below the larynx with the tape sloping slightly downward to the front. Avoid flaring your neck out. For women only: Measure the circumference of the hips, at the largest horizontal measure. 

As your level of fitness increases, the cardiovascular system gets more and more efficient at delivering oxygen and necessary nutrients to the muscles throughout the body - so the fitter you get, the more "effort" (as in physical work) you can put in at the same heart rate. If you get a heart rate monitor and always run at exactly your "optimal fat burning" heart rate (let's say at about 110 bpm), you'd be able to run faster and faster at that same heart rate over time (because the efficiency of your cardiovascular system would keep improving). That being said - effort, or should I say perceived effort is a completely subjective thing. What might feel like an all-out-sprint to an untrained person, might feel like an easy warm up to a trained professional - even though they're putting in the exact same amount of "effort". 

There are many different variations out there. It depends on your goals, how your body works, what kind of training program you're doing. For example, some people can go straight to their repitition weight whereas people like me, need to warm-up to it. This is where the variation of the weights come into play. Since I am unsure of your goal, I'll take my goals as an example. My goal is to gain strength and mass. Therefore I warm up for two sets. One set with light weight at first for 15 reps (60kg) and another with more moderate weight for 12 reps (84kg). Once I get into my real sets (aka no more warm ups) then I will put on 100kg and and go for 6-8. 

Switch up your diet if needed. Paleo diet is great, but have you tried anything else? If you're looking to burn fat through your cardio, try to stay in a rythme where you'll be able to hold a conversation with someone without being out of breath. When you find that fine line, you'll get better results from the fat loss department. As for the weights, if you've only been doing weights maybe it's time to try plyometric exercises. I suggest talking to a personal trainer. Remember ... Even if you're not losing weight, perhaps your losing fat but building muscle at the same time which won't change your current weight. 

I'd say because most of the (non-scientific) advice I've seen around the web is "endurance" stuff. So start with x squeezes every day and build up to 600 per day or whatever. If you exercise like that you're not really gaining strength (at least after a certain point), but simply building up endurance. So it's kinda like running longer and longer every day (at roughly the same pace) instead of weight lifting with progressing difficulty for strength/mass gains. To bring my point home, the way most people exercise their PC muscle can be done on a daily basis. But if you truly trained your PC muscle to reach peak strength (which is definitely what you need if you're after the male multi-orgasm thing), then you'd get better results with longer recovery periods. Because, at least to my knowledge, the PC muscle responds to training no differently than any other muscle in our body. 

While I can't provide you with a sortable "fullness factor" database - here's exactly how I would get a list of the foods you're looking for... First, you need a sortable list - and you can download the USDA nutrient database in excel here: $URL$ You can begin with sorting all the foods ascending by calories - and you'll quickly realize you can chew through pound after pound of different vegetables & fruits every day (while easily staying well within your calorie limits). Now, since fiber ($URL$ and proteins ($URL$ have been proven to increase satiety... You could also try sorting by fiber or protein columns or even make a calculated column, like fiber/calories or protein/calories and sort by those columns - to come up with a list of "highly-filling foods" (that only bring a few calories to the table). 

Without a video of your form, really difficult to give you a straight answer. Assuming your form is on par, try what Derek mentioned. I tend to use some long soccer socks or thick, long socks so the bar doesn't rub to much against the shins. You can also try wrapping some type of padding around the bar where it meets your shins. 

Dave has it right on. Resistance band deadlifts will not replace straight heavy deads on their on. They are just merely a supplemental exercise for building a stronger deadlift. Dumbbells would be a good alternative if you can get some heavy ones that can provide maximum benefits. 

Deadlifts on their own would not add muscle even though they are often attributed to it. In order for you to pack on muscle, you would have to eat more to sustain enough energy to warrant muscle group. If you deadlift and your nutrition is off point and your not eating enough, you won't build muscle. 

If you're trying to get a muscular physique in your home gym than you might encounter several problems. The most common being: 

Home Exercise Training Here are some (beginner) exercises that I provide some of my clients with who train at home. The following will include links of how-to's, videos, and images that show you which body part you will train. The descriptions in the links provided help a lot. They explain thoroughly and have helped me complete some of my exercises. Note: I wasn't sure if you had a bench so I tried including exercises which didn't have any benches 

How important is condition in such an event? Spartan Sprint A 5-7km race with 12 obstacles can take between 1-2 hours with average conditioning. Super Spartan A 12-15km race with 20 obstacles can take about 2-4 hours with average conditioning. It all depends on what kind of results you're expecting for the race ... Do you wish to finish first or simply finish for the sake of completing the race? The people who finish first in these races are very well conditioned with multiple years of training for this specific type of race. In any case, good luck on the race, AROO! 

I've seen professional Muay Thai fighters complete 2hour+ morning sessions that included running, sparring/bag work and strength training - so yes, it's quite possible to do what you described - or even endure much longer training sessions on a daily basis...but like other people mentioned, your level of fitness will decide whether you're over-training or not. 

body fat calculator formula for man: 495/(1.0324-0.19077(LOG(waist-neck))+0.15456(LOG(height)))-450 body fat calculator formula for woman: 495/(1.29579-0.35004(LOG(waist+hip-neck))+0.22100(LOG(height)))-450 All you'd have to do, is convert centimeters into inches (inches = centimeters / 2.54) and use those values in those equations...or just use the calculator here (just switch it over to the "metric" tab) Hope this is what you're looking for. 

If anything, I'd definitely avoid cardio in your case. Here's a study ($URL$ where people, who exercised after their glycogen reserves were already wiped out, burned away 13.7 grams of proteins per hour of exercise (that was measured through sweat alone), which is an equivalent of a little below 70 grams of muscle mass. Your training performance will also drop once your glycogen reserves are depleted ($URL$ As far as muscle preservation (or even hypertrophy) is concerned, strength training shouldn't be as much of a problem IF you keep your protein intake high enough and don't interrupt ketosis with carbs. But studies on nitrogen balance while strength training in ketosis (especially with powerlifting) aren't exactly plentiful...at least not to my knowledge.
