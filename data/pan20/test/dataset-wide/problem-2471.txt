why doesn't everyone become a Buddhist to attain supreme bliss? I think that a "true" Christian may have beliefs which (may) help them to find some peace or solace, and which have some similarities at least in their effect (if not in their form) to Buddhist beliefs. I guess for example, faith that "It's God's will" or "This is part of God's plan", and the "Lord's Prayer" that, "Let thy will (not my will) be done", might help to alleviate a personal craving for something to be other than it is (and therefore, alleviate that type of dukkha). Similarly the virtue of Charity (which is Christianity's "greatest" virtue, and the second of the two "great commandments") remind me of some things which the Dalai Lama has written, about caring for other people to avoid being trapped in your own "self". I know less about Hinduism; but a while ago I asked about this story which I half remembered, Self like a diamond, because I assumed its moral was Buddhist: I recently discovered that story is from a Shivaite tradition ... which I haven't been taught, but of which I get the impression that the principal doctrine, attitude, or action seems to be something like, "Everything is God, let me lose my self in order to find or be with God" ... so again there's some kind of non-self doctrine happening there. I'm not trying to say that these other traditions are as good as Buddhism, nor the same as Buddhism ... but perhaps they address or attempt to address some of the same human frailties ... and people's needs are at least partly addressed by the religion they have. Another answer to your question is that there are historical reasons. The Buddhadharma has existed in the West for only about the last 100 years or so ... if you learned any religion from your parents, it probably wasn't Buddhism. Sometimes people who have any existing religion might be averse to learning or practicing a new one: Islam may penalize apostates; Judaism (and Christianity) have the first commandment; see also Meditating and including buddhist philosophy in your life without abandoning previous religious beliefs? Then again, maybe your premise ("why doesn't everyone become a Buddhist") is wrong ... maybe everyone does become Buddhist! I discovered that "zen" has become a well-known, everyday or "current" adjective in France ... a synonym for cool or calm, detached, unstressed. So everyone has some idea of what it means, what its values are. People who are interested can find more ... there are many centres (e.g. in Paris), there's Plum Village, there are books in a large local book store, etc. Also, as I said in How to explain what Buddhism is?, I've found that not everyone seems to feel the need for what Buddhism has to offer ... and/or that Buddhism isn't sufficiently well taught, well explained to people ... so that's another reason that not everyone is interested. I won't say "there aren't enough good Buddhist role models for people emulate" because maybe that's not true, however maybe those good role models (who other people might meet every day in society) aren't people who preach, or teach that Buddhism is essential -- How are Buddhists supposed to spread Buddhism? Finally the answer I accepted to that question suggests that there are different forms of Buddhism ("each branch has a slightly different take on what the problem is that Buddhism is meant to solve"). If you think there's "one true form" of Buddhism which results in "getting Nirvana", you might note that not even all "Buddhists" will become that type of Buddhist. 

does OM have an ordinary meaning Although it's hard to prove a negative, people don't explain its "ordinary meaning" when they explain it, so I assume the answer is "no". I guess it has two actual meanings. The first "actual meaning" IMO is that people explain that it has three syllables (or four if you count the silence afterwards); and, that each of the three syllables refers to different things ... but, there are diverse explanations of what those three things are. 

There are various discussions of how to use it and whether or not there's any reason it seems likely to be helpful, for example here. Someone suggested for example that the (non-Buddhist) Iberians in Roman times used it like toothpaste for bleeding gums. Also this suggests why it's allowable -- it's not a luxury: 

Identity view (sakkāya-diṭṭhi) is the first of the ten fetters. The "eradication" of identity-view is important towards enlightenment. Presumably, "eradication of identity-view" is more than simply claiming, "Yes, there's no self anywhere!!" So, how should one understand what "identity-view" is, and whether it's eradicated? If "eradication" of identity-view marks an important step or stage, can that eradication be analyzed into smaller substeps (e.g. is there an 80-step lesson plan or set of tests towards eradicating it)? Can you give some of important examples of the practical consequence of identity-view: how it affects belief and behaviour? So that it might be possible to use the presence or absence of these beliefs and behaviours to test whether identify-view exists or has been eradicated? Is "eradication of identity-view" synonymous with having no habits? Can you recommend any competent English-language literature on this topic? If there are not good questions to be asking about identity-view please suggest better ones! 

I think you mean "legally allowed", which isn't really a question about Buddhism (for example maybe it would be more on-topic at writers.se). Anyway my understanding is that copyright laws vary from country to country. Ancient works might not be copyright, but modern translations of those works might be copyright. You might find "copyleft" or "public domain" translations, for example here. You might assume (correctly or incorrectly) that quoting a small portion counts as "fair use" and use it (possibly with attribution and without prior permission). Or, getting copyright permission might be a job for your publisher (unless you self-publish). Otherwise I think you get copyright by contacting the copyright-holder (who is usually identified, in a publication) and asking for permission. 

If a dog is (immediately/already) not a cat, or if the moon is not a finger (or if a chariot is not an axle and an axle is not a chariot), then I think you can say that "it is not" -- without trying to say, "a dog is like the eventual non existence, annihilation of a cat" (but maybe whether or not you call it "eventual" depends on whether you believe in "sudden enlightenment"). 

So are there any single word? In summary I agree with "goodwill" or "benevolence" as the best single-word translation. If there is not single word, what the reason? I think there are two reasons: 

I remember the TV news reporting the 9/11 attacks in New York. Two or three weeks later the TV was still replaying or showing the same photos of the infamous footage, and I switched off the TV news and I haven't watched American TV since then. The subsequent invasion of Iraq by the Coalition of the willing (not to mention the invasion of Afghanistan) seems to me related to that kind of propaganda. 

What it is I guess a problem with the kinds of descriptions in the Milinda Pañha is that, so far as I know, Nirvana is a not-thing -- for example an absence of craving and attachment, and unconditioned (not a caused thing). What it isn't If there's a feeling of spaciousness or limitlessness associated with an absence of form/contraint, that (limitlessness) might remind you of an ocean; however, saying that it's like an ocean implies that (like an ocean) it is substantial. So I'd start by saying it's not like any "thing", no thing which has a form. Saying it's "like something" is a weak description because you're likely to want to seize that thing, to examine its form etc. Why it's described in both ways But as well as being described using negative attributes (e.g. "deathless"), it's also described using positives. For example it is also described as "an Island" and so on ... I guess the "strength" of that description is that it would be "weak", misleading, unattractive, perhaps incomprehensible to only describe it as "non-existent" ... so it's described in terms of its effect rather than its form (it provides the same effect as an island, i.e. like a rescue from a flood). 

More generally I think it's a category of knowledge. Here's a (slightly rude or brusque or plainspoken) quote from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance -- this quote is talking about Aristotle's "dialectic" but it could IMO equally be talking about "mathematics": 

"Awareness of the flow" doesn't seem to be a standard phrase (if you Google for it). So I tried two Google searches to try to find out how he (Stephen Levine) uses the phrase (I haven't read his book): 

Sorry I don't have much spare time so I'm going to write this answer mostly using hyperlinks. I haven't heard the phrase "Everything is lust and mirage" before (is it a quote?), but it sounds like it's talking about the main two of the Three Poisons. Also "not giving a damn" (in the title) sounds to me like the third poison, i.e. "aversion" or "hatred". 

There's a chapter about the Brahmaviharas in the Visuddhimagga -- chapter IX, which starts on page 291 of this PDF: Path of Purification (Visuddhimagga). The section on Equanimity starts on page 310. The Visuddhimagga is a Theravada text, I'm not sure whether it's "canonical" (Wikipedia says, "It is considered the most important Theravada text outside of the Tipitaka canon of scriptures"). 

Apparently the earliest phase of Buddhism was aniconic: see Aniconism in Buddhism. I'd treat the above as an orthodox answer but it's possible that the answer (personal beliefs, people's hopes for answered prayer) may vary from person to person and/or from school to school. 

... and that's just classical mechanics, ignoring relativistic and quantum mechanics. Something like the weather (how strong the wind is going to be, whether it will rain, what the temperature will be) is arguably "part of nature". There too there are "lots of variables" involved. In order to predict tomorrow's weather, "an equation" isn't enough: they need to use many, many equations, and a supercomputer on which to run simulations, and even then it's only limited accuracy and range. Similarly I think it's possible to say that Karma exists and is a "natural law", just as it's possible to say that weather exists. Perhaps you'd think it might be easy, but in practice it isn't easy, to describe weather even using several equations, let alone just "an equation". You needs laws describing temperature, pressure, density, fluid dynamics, Coriolis because the earth is spinning, differential heating, and then local weather caused by the existence of land and sea and mountains and ocean currents etc. etc. etc. Again I suggest you stop trying to see a link between Buddhism and Physics. Physics is useful as far as it goes, but it cannot even describe the relationship between a boy and his dog (or perhaps "between a child and a teacher" if you don't have any relationships with dogs). 

Even only the (collections of) suttas are long (see also Why isn't there a Buddhist Bible?), though IMO it's beneficial to study even one sutta. So, an alternative is to read a modern introduction, perhaps one which is structured as an anthology or summary of selected suttas, for example: 

I don't know whether this quote (therefore this answer) addresses the "metaphor" and "upaya" and "supernatural" parts of your question, but I think it's partially relevant given your mention of cosmology. This speech was composed for "the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience". 

Is the Tipitaka arranged in useful sequence? I feel like I'm walking into a library, looking at the Dewey Decimal Classification and wondering which I should read first. I take it that the Tipitaka is not chronological! Am I right in think that the Dhammacakkappavattana is the first and most important sutta? If so is it sensible that, there, it is "SN 56.11" (i.e. not the first sutta)? What other "important" suttas should I read "first"? Is more known about the sequence in which the Buddha himself delivered them (e.g. if the Sermon at Benares was the first, was the Fire Sermon the second, and which then was the third, etc.)? Please answer any or all questions above. Or you could answer this question by commenting on what it says at Which suttas should I read? Do you agree with what it says there, do you have anything to add to what it says there, or to take away? 

You didn't say exactly what kind of "untamed words and actions" you're worried about, but talking about yourself might be a general solution. For example I met a married couple recently, of whom one seemed to criticize the other a bit more than I thought was healthy. I considered telling them not to do that, and decided that it wasn't my business and that they wouldn't accept it from me. So instead (without mentioning them) I told them about my experience with my relationship with my wife, how we learned to stop our arguing; and I hope that was a more successful/informative/hopeful conversation. In summary, maybe talk out of your own experience. Also consider getting expert/specialized help or advice (e.g. ask a doctor or a teacher). 

The last item, "his life even he sacrifices for one's sake" -- can that be reconciled with the answers to the question, How to be compassionate to a friend in need? Those answers seem to suggest that you can only help yourself. Apparently the question in the OP was mistaking the purpose of a "friend": if you are wise your friend isn't there to help you (i.e. doesn't exist only to help you), although, they do help you; instead your friend is there (i.e. is with you) so you can help them. 

I assume they have a body (i.e. a form) but whether it's a "physical" body I can't tell you. It might be hard to distinguish between "Buddhism" and local folk beliefs or traditions -- whether ghosts are "real". I think that Buddhism doesn't say very much about them ... and says that they characterize excessive greed, deceit and so on ... that they arise from being insatiably greedy. 

I think that "non-duality" as a teaching will be found more in scriptures that are later than the Pali canon, so maybe there isn't exactly a Pali word for that philosophy. If there is such a word though then it might be advaya ... Dvaya means "two-fold" or "dual"; so advaya means "not two-fold", "non-dual", or "single". Maybe the Vimalakirti Sutra de-emphasizes the "outside world" by talking about "emptiness" ... the Pali word for that is suññatā. 

It might be better to ask this question on Biology.SE or Fitness.SE or somewhere like that. My theory on the subject is as follows: 

Finally, you maybe try to avoid getting get the reputation of saying that Vipassana courses are the only solution to all of everyone's pains (even if you find it a solution to yours).
