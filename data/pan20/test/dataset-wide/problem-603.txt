Could I buy such a wheel, or would I just have to build it? I've heard disc-wheels won't take the punishment from normal brakes. Edit: I want to get new wheels, and I want to be able to swap them between frames. I don't want to convert all my frames to disc brakes, but I do want parts compatible between all my bikes. 

I feel dumb asking this, but how should the chain be routed around the cogs on this deraillier? I had to split the chain and then put it back on. I didn't pay attention to how it went round. This is not the right way (below) as the chain is extremely slack. 

I weigh about 120 kilos. Saddle rails bend. I don't care about the weight of the saddle, just how strong the rails are and how comfy it is (I admire but have no desire to emulate people who cycle standing up. I have a bmi over 30, give me some credit for voluntarily cycling 20 miles a day) 

Should be perfectly safe. I actually did a similar thing on my road bike to allow a little more cushion in the rear, for my rear. The only hassle I can see is if you have to carry two different tubes. Can't remember off the top of my head if you can get some that span those two sizes. 

Make sure the tension is low at first (should be a little screwn on face of pedal). Generally you will get to a point of looseness where you are popping out unintentionally, go just tigher than that. Cleat placement also can be a factor. The closer to the toe it is, the easier it tends to be to get out. Be careful about moving too far from the balls of your feet, it could end up with achy toes! Lastly, see if the sole of your shoe is interferring with the pedal. If it is dragging, you can get little spacers that go between sole and cleat. Don't worry about damaging the cleat, you will do more walking around on concrete. Also, you will probably fall at least once while getting used to them. It is almost a rite of passage. 

Normally if everything is going right: you shouldn't have this problem. I was having this problem: The bike shifted great on the stand but performed horribly under load. The solution was the frame was failing near the bottom bracket, causing the frame to flex when I was pedaling. I've also seen posts where a rear hub failure was the culprit. 

My road bike is aluminum with a carbon rear triangle. The carbon rear slides into the aluminum, and I believe was bonded with some sort of epoxy. The pieces have begun to separate after 2.5 years and the company will not warranty the frame. Is it possible to repair this by inserting epoxy into the gap and sliding the carbon back in place? What sort of precautions should I take, and epoxy should I use? If I can pull the carbon out further, should I sand the two surfaces before re-bonding? 

I am buying a second hand frame (Dawes 201 hybrid) build up (first time doing that, so exciting). I'm paying cash on collection, so can back out if anything looks wrong. What should I look for on the frame to make sure it's up to scratch?. 

About 4 miles away from me, there is a bike hire shop that has tandems. I'm trying to work out the logistics of getting the tandem to my house to pick up the other rider. I'm an experienced cyclist, but have never ridden a tandem before. It's not convenient for both of us to go to the shop. Is riding a tandem particularly difficult for one person? I suppose I'll get the bus there... 

$URL$ I asked the company that manufactures them, they said they didn't know. Idiots. Does anyone know the sizes? I ask because the set is not available in the UK. Flying it over the Atlantic seems ridonkulous when I could just buy some o rings here. 

Do you have access to an elevation map of the area? I believe on that type of map, the closer together the lines are, the steeper the grade. 

I believe one pro of canti's are that they tend to have more mud clearance. I think that is one of the reasons that cyclocross bikes run them, at least until they started allowing discs. 

First, in the front they are called chainrings, god knows why they need to have a different name, but they do. The fronts can be sold as a set, but can just as easily be gotten individually. I actually purchased a 26T chainring in the front for something like $10. For chainrings you will need to know the diameter (in millimeters) of an imaginary circle that would pass through all the bolts that hold the ring on and also the number of bolts that hold it on. Often there is one diameter that holds that smallest ring and another that holds the two larger ones. In the rear, you don't need to know the diameter, just the number of gears. Cassettes are often sold as a group and the two big names are SRAM and Shimano and for 9 speeds they are compatible with each other. At the small end of the cassette, your current setup is about as small as you will find (11T), but if you are wanting more climbing ability they make big cogs up to 36T (or bigger if you want custom). There is currently an option to go with 10 speeds but that will require replacing your entire drivetrain, not a cheap option. Before you go replacing the chainrings, try the cassette first and see if that resolves you skipping issue. 

I ride pretty aggressively cross country and trail in colorado, and occasionally will go to the bike park and do some jumps. I recently bought a specialized hardrock 29er for my wife, who's a novice rider. The price was right, and the bike is great for her. The problem is I want to ride it sometimes, but the fork sketches me out. First: it sucks compared to my fox fork on my 26" bike and second: I'm afraid it's going to break on me. The fork is an 80mm SR suntour. Does anybody have any suggestions for reasonably priced replacements? I don't want to change the geometry too much. I think the idea is if i put some money into the fork, we could put it on her next bike if/when she decides to upgrade. 

If this is a stem... ... what's this? I'm asking because I need to buy a taller one so I don't have to bend over as far. It's not convenient to buy a new bike, and I already have an adjustable stem which just doesn't quite get me there. 

I have a wheel with a puncture. It seems to be a pinch flat (the air is shooting out in the direction of the rim) but I can't get the tyre off to investigate. This is an ex-tubeless tyre that I put a tube in once. Guess I should have cleaned up the sealant first. Now I can't even move the tyre, let alone remove it. The rim is aluminium. Is there a powerful solvent that is safe to use, that would weaken the old Stan's + muck glue? I googled around this, and most answers are 'be a man! use tyre levers! No, they're for girls, use your thumbs!'. Well, I'm beat. I have poor muscle tone and bad motor skills for medical reasons, so I accept the possibility that 'normal' people could just pull it off. I, however, can't. The suggestion here was use a credit card but that didn't work. I could take it to the bike shop, but something tells me this isn't the last time something like this will happen. I'd like a solution for next time. I need a solvent that won't attack the aluminium. Ideally I'd like to save the tyre/tube, but that's a bonus. Edit: whoever suggested a vice, that worked. It unstuck the tyre and I could remove it normally with tyre levers. 

I had this trouble, and after checking the usual suspects (Replaced chain, cassette, cables, housing, and derailleur), it turned out my frame was failing near the bottom bracket. Although it's the most expensive to fix: before you start replacing components, do a quick visual inspection of the frame. Look for cracks/separations around the rear triangle. This is a rare problem, but could be the most serious. If you determine your frame is fine: 

I've spent hours with my bike on the stand. On the stand: it performs great. When I ride, I can cause the rear gears to shift just by changing how hard I pedal (the harder i pedal, the higher up on the cassette the chain will jump. If i let up, the chain will drop into a harder gear) I've replaced almost everything: Cables/Housing Cassette and Chain, even the rear deraillure hanger and deraillure. Any ideas would be helpful. 

I mostly mountain bike (or maybe mountain crash) and one thing I always try and remember is to NOT stick my arm out to break my fall. Many a friend has snapped a collar bone doing that. I often end up almost balling up, and while it is more out of fear of impending doom than any thought of protection I have been pretty lucky so far. She can also wear long sleeve wicking shirts and tights, would give some protection from road rash and also help with sunburns. 

Pushing pins out and then jamming them back in are bound to cause a certain amount of strain on the links. Buy a connector link and replace one of your links with it, creating a "quick release" chain. Make sure that you get a link that is the same width as your chain. Even better, buy a few of them. I actually keep one with me, that way if I break a chain it makes repairs so much easier.
