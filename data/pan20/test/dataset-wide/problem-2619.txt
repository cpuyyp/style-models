Not certain I really grasp the true gist of what you are asking, at least without asking you to further define [your use of]the terms "conceptual", "property" and "real", but along similar lines, you may wish to explore Immanuel Kant’s transcendental musings. According to Kant, it is vital always to distinguish between the distinct realms of phenomena and noumena. Phenomena are the appearances, which constitute the our experience; whereas noumena are the (presumed to exist) things themselves, which constitute reality, what we call "the world". All of our [synthetic a priori] judgments apply only to the phenomenal realm, not to the noumenal. Because the thing in itself would by definition be entirely independent of our experience of it, we are utterly ignorant of the noumenal realm 

Whether the proposition is fallacious or sophistic depends upon the utterer's epistemological presuppositions. If a [naive?] realist, then Jobermark's answer will suffice. If, however, the speaker is [for instance] an anti-Kantian/enlightenment-universalist Herderian neo-pragmatist/historicist (a historical forebear of contemporary "post-truth" culture and its fetish with identity politics), your interlocutor is essentially/merely telling you that you lack the cognitive/emotional/historical equipment to occupy the logical space occupied by women, you lack the hardware necessary to run the software, so to speak. (Have a look at Rorty's Feminism and Pragmatism, at p. 202 of his Philosophical Papers, Volume 3, Truth and Progress, which, while not directly on point, expands upon this answer.) I understand @Jobermark's point, both in response to my original entry and in response to Chen’s entry. However, I do not believe he grasps the thrust of my, and possibly Chen’s, argument. I mentioned Rorty's Feminism and Pragmatism, at p. 202 of his Philosophical Papers. What follows is a quotation from the first page of that essay, followed by an entry quoting Dewey, from the same essay at p. 216: “When two women ascended to the Supreme Court of Minnesota, Catherine MacKinnon asked, “Will they use the tools of law as women, for all women?” She continued as follows: I think that the real feminist issue is not whether biological males or biological females hold positions of power, although it is utterly essential that women be there. And I am not saying that viewpoints have genitals. My issue is what our identifications are, what our loyalties are, who our community is, to whom we are accountable. If it seems as if this is not very concrete, I think it is because we have no idea what women as women would have to say. I’m evoking for women a role that we have yet to make, in the name of a voice that, unsilenced,might say something that has never been heard. “ [ McKinnon, Feminism Unmodified: Discourses on Life and Law (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1987), p. 77]. “Urging judges to “use the tools of law as women, for all women” alarms universalist philosophers. These are the philosophers who think that moral theory should come up with principles which mention no group smaller that “persons” or “human beings” or “rational agents.” Such philosophers would be happier if MacKinnon talked less about accountability to women as women and more about an ideal Minnesota, or an ideal America, one in which all human beings would be treated impartially. Universalists would prefer to think of feminism as Mary Wollstonecraft and Olympe de Gouges did, as a matter of rights which are already recognizable and describable, although not yet granted. This describability, they feel, makes MacKinnon’s hope for a voice saying something never heard before unnecessary, overly dramatic, hyperbolic.” Universalist philosophers assume, with Kant, that all the logical space necessary for moral deliberation is now available — that all important truths about right and wrong can not only be stated, but be made plausible, in language already to hand. I take MacKinnon to be siding with historicists like G. W. F. Hegel and John Dewey, and to be saying that moral progress depends upon expanding this space.” And quoting Dewey: “Women have as yet made little contribution to philosophy, but when women who are not mere students of other persons’ philosophy set out to write it, we cannot conceive that it will be the same in viewpoint or tenor as that composed from the standpoint of the different masculine experience of things. Institutions, customs of life, breed certain systematized predilections and aversions. The wise man reads historic philosophies to detect in them intellectual formulations of men’s habitual purposes and cultivated wants, not to gain insight into the ultimate nature of things or information about the make-up of reality. As far as what is loosely called reality figures in philosophies, we may be sure that it signifies those selected aspects of the world which are chosen because they lend themselves to the support of men’s judgment of the worth-while life, and hence are most highly prized. In philosophy, “reality” is a term of value or choice.” (John Dewey, “Philosophy and Democracy,” in Middle Works 11:145) Thus, it is conceivable that there are differences though not necessarily innate/intrinsic/essential differences, between the categories male and female which in fact impact how each experiences (or causally interacts with) the world/their environment - and if either their epistemological presuppositions AND/OR their ontological commitments differ, it is problematic to say that a logical fallacy is NECESSARILY committed by suggesting that a man’, understanding of a woman’s problem differs from a woman’s understanding of the problem. 

You are looking for a fallacy that could result from this statement, not for a fallacy in the statement itself. An obvious fallacy that could result from this statement would be to make the wrong assumption that "thy neighbours" means explicitly only people living nearby or who are personally close to you, and that it is perfectly allowable to spread lies about people who live further away. 

Convicts are almost always guilty. Wrongfully convicted people are convicts. Therefore, wrongfully convicted people are almost always guilty [wrong!] 

It isn't a logical fallacy. If I add 2 + 2 = 5, that's wrong. But it isn't a logical fallacy, because logic wasn't needed here. Same in your example, being unclear about the relationship between a change rate and an actual value happens before logic is used and therefore isn't a logical fallacy. Logic allows us to combine correct logical statements according to certain rules and derive new correct logical statements. One such rule would be for example "If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C". A logical fallacy is a rule to combine correct logical statements, which sometimes or always produces false logical statements. There was no rule to combine logical statements applied here. What the two statements in your example do as a whole is to apply a rhetorical trick. Two statements are made (without any proof, so we don't know whether they are true or false, and one as you believe of there dubious value). The first is a statement that some people, depending on their prejudice, would think of as negative behaviour, and the second is one that most people would think of as negative. The reader is intended to draw the conclusion that the first implies the second, and is further intended to draw the conclusion that the behaviour in the first statement (being an atheist) should be avoided. That of course is a pure trick and absolute nonsense. There is absolutely no reason to believe that both statements are in any way related. I might as well say "1. Sweden is cold in the winter. 2. IQs in Sweden are dropping." and then we all conclude that Swedes should spend their winters in a warmer climate. On the other hand, that trick means to author's conclusion cannot be refuted, because the author never actually drew a conclusion but relied on the reader to make it. 

Wehler is right. As your question is phrased, an exclusively physicalist ontology will not suffice (without deploying something like Wehler’s informatics ontology, or Klocking’s notion that concepts are emergent properties of [some] physical entities). But the ontological issue issue is alive and well, as you can see from nir/wehler’s lively discussion (with no end in site). Start by considering the “knowledge argument,” which purports to show that physicalism is wrong because conscious experience involves non-physical properties, and is premised on the idea that someone who has “complete physical knowledge about another conscious being might yet lack knowledge about how it feels to have the experiences of that being”. See http:plato.stanford.edu/entries/qualia-knowledge/ for a full rendition of the notion and issues. Here, you will find Frank Jackson’s formulation of the idea which underlies the knowledge argument in the now famous example of the neurophysiologist Mary: 

Upon revisiting your question and commentary, I was struck by your reliance on the notion of “faithful[ness]” (…it only needs faithfulness (e.g., a photo is never truly accurate because it is not comprehensive, but it can be a faithful representation of something and adequately express truths;” “Nothing needs to be comprehensive to have meaning—it is enough to be faithful,” and so on). It reminded me of James’s [undefined, possibly primitive] “agrees with” formation. The idea seems to be that a description or representation need only be faithful to what it represents/describes in order for it to be “true”, and for meaning to exist or “arise.” That it is not necessary for the word/world relationship, in order to “adequately express truth,” to also be comprehensive, and express “true accuracy.” Generally speaking, post Quine/Wittgenstein, no reasonable and reasonably informed person would disagree. However, as we know so well, the devil is in the details. In the kind of debate you have sparked by your post, the salient question is whether that representation, in order to have “faithfulness,” in order to “adequately express truth,” need also be unique and indispensable to our ability to adequately represent/describe the world at all. Ordinarily, that a symbol is faithful to what it represents does not entail it being the only symbol capable doing so (which is not to say that it cannot be thus for a particular pair at a particular time). And this may be all that your relativist frenemies are doing. Pointing out that it is generally the case, or (to use your preferred vocabulary), it is faithful to his/her experience of the world, [to say/believe] that more than one symbol can be said to faithfully represent a particular thing/event perceived to be out there. This statement is not self-refuting. And, following Davidson’s charity principle, it might be helpful to interpret what “relativists” say in this way, rather than considering [all of them] them to be “self-absorbed egomaniacs who care nothing if they tickle their own ears at others' expense” [though some, like some realists/absolutists, may very well be]. 

The terms are explained in this wikipedia article: $URL$ "Unconcious incompetence" happens when you are so incompetent that you cannot even realise how incompetent you are. "What could be difficult about parking a car?" "Conscious incompetence" is one level better - you realise your incompetence. "I can't park this car without hitting others". Then comes "conscious competence" - you are competent when you think about things. "I learned to park my car without bumping into things following these simple steps..." And then "unconscious competence", when you are so good at something you don't even think about it. "What could be difficult about parking a car?" Or look at books. A child goes through the stages: Not knowing what written text in a book is. Knowing that there is written text in a book, but you can't read it. Working hard to read. Reading without thinking. "So is there any reliable way to know if I'm being ignorant or must I forever toil in the purgatory of uncertainty?" Lack of uncertainty doesn't mean you are competent. Actually it indicates you are either very competent or very incompetent. Total fools often have not the slightest doubt in their competence. The only reliable way is to make decisions that can be judged later, and judge their outcomes. Since you start with low competence that hopefully improves over time, it's best to start with decisions that make little impact if you get them wrong. When you must make decisions (have no choice), just do your best. Don't worry, because worrying doesn't improve your decision making, and it doesn't improve how you implement decisions. 

Take two species. Mostly identical, but one has genes that make the members of the species try to survive and produce offspring, while the other species doesn't have that tendency. Wait ten generations. How many of the second species are left? Quite simply, species that don't have genes that tend to produce offspring will be dying out quite quickly. And because they die out, we don't see them. The fact that we see a species proves that it must be designed to survive and reproduce. Within a species, there will be variation of behaviour. Every member of a species having the same behaviour doesn't tend to be good for survival of the species. And there is no need for individual survival. With some species, there is no need for survival past the production of offspring, and often the individuals of the species will naturally die shortly after offspring is produced. 

You will definitely want to read Hans-Johann Glock's What is Analytic Philosophy? (2008), where the author addresses the question by approaching it from various angles: historical, methodological, topical, ideological, ethical/political and geographical. It is not only a great, informative read, but also contains a formidable bibliography addressing your second question. 

Your specific point is addressed later, where it is pointed out that “talk of ‘physical information’ in the context of the knowledge argument is ambiguous between an epistemological and an ontological reading," and two alternatives are offered: The weaker, epistemological version: 

In other words, we are increasingly in the age of the instrumental model, not of theories about general laws of nature. In fact, the last sentence of the abstract is redolent of Richard Rorty’s suggestion that we move from objectivity to solidarity as the goal of inquiry. (It’s a shame that he failed to live long enough to see his vision begin to take hold in the culture; and maybe to comment upon whether and how “identity politics” may have hijacked his notion of solidarity.) The question I pose here is, in light of our intellectual history, what, if any, is the role of a public philosopher, a public intellectual, in the current “post truth” (read “post objective fact”) universe of discourse? 

If the defining concept of trans theory, “Gender dysphoria”, is defined as “the condition of feeling one's emotional and psychological identity as male or female to be opposite to one's biological sex,” and if the referenced “feeling” denotes a discrepancy between one’s behavioral predispositions and the behavioral dispositions deemed appropriate by one'ssociety/culture to one’s biological gender (the supposedly socially constructed gender role of one’s biological gender), then there would seem to be some contradiction between transgenderism and feminism as you have defined it (the traditional definition). If, however, with Commando, that “feeling” of dysphoria instead denotes somehow “experiencing” the neurological difference between a cis and a trans brain (see Commando’s comment and citation to a Scientific American article: “There are neurological accounts of gender (e.g. 1,) which do not commit to gender roles.”), then there need be no contradiction. However, the cited article would seem to open a can of worms. For what the article seems to imply is that there are four materially different brains (or brain types): cis male, cis female, trans male and trans female. If so, then it makes sense to reconsider whether “gender roles” are in fact social constructs or something else. (Moreover, such a scenario also addresses you “mind-body” problem by rendering it moot -- it is body (read brain) all the way down.) 

I wouldn't say they are acting against his will. Compulsion and free will are not the same. The hoarder doesn't make a free will decision to hoard. He isn't capable of wanting the mess to be cleared up. I think it would be unethical to clean up the house against his will (even then if he doesn't want help only because he doesn't want to burden his daughters but the daughters think it isn't a burden it could be a different situation). But in this case, they would clean up the home against the expression of his compulsion, not against his will. So unless the cleanup would actually hurt him, I think it is ethical. 

You might have not voted under the assumption that all available candidates are reasonably decent human beings, and electing any of them would lead to a reasonably good outcome. When that assumption is wrong and the candidate that the majority voted for turns out to be Hitler jr. , you have the right to complain. So does everyone who voted against him, and everybody who voted for him and didn't realise what the person would be like once elected. Of course it might turn out that all of you just lost their right to complain... 

If I ran at high speed into a lamp post, my nose would be bleeding. My nose is not bleeding. Therefore, I didn't run into a lamp post. You asked: "If we base the truth of the conditional off the truth of p and q, how can we know that the conditional is true before knowing whether both p and q are true?" In the example, p and q are both false. I didn't run into the lamp post, my nose isn't bleeding. But the conditional is true. p -> q is true in three out of four cases: If p and q are both false, if they are both true, and if p is false but q is true. It is only false if p is true and q is false. 

Wittgenstein once said [and may have later recanted] that the world is everything that is the case, the totality of facts not of things, and that that world is determined by those facts, and they're being all the facts, since the totality of facts determines what is and what is not the case. In conversation, we often use the phrases, "this/that is the fact of the matter," and "this or that is, or is not, the case." In light of Wittgenstein's observations, (or rejecting them), is there such a thing as the fact of the matter, or a case [of the matter]? That is,what is the fact of the matter regarding the "fact of the matter" usage? If there is [a fact of the matter re this ussage], can it be described? 

My understanding is that words called "verb" convey actions, occurrences, or states of being. So our grammatical conventions say it is a verb. But, technically, it is interesting to note (in the context of King's answer, and the supposed "paradox of analysis"), that you did not ask whether "to be" is a verb, but whether 'is' is. 

Looking at your profile before answering, this is a very tough question. The perennial realism/anti-realism debate essentially boils down to whether and how language (formerly -- pre 20th Century -- thoughts/experience) hook up to things/objects -- whether they be chairs, numbers or theorems. Given your level of logical, but not philosophical (ontology v. metaphisics v. epistemology), sophistication, and not knowing what you want to do with the knowledge/distinction, I would say start maybe with some light CS Pierce semiotics (though Kant and Carnap would also be likely starting points), then Quine (maybe Truth by Convention and On What There Is), Wittgenstein's Tractatus (first), then the Investigations (after reading about how it came to be that evolved/devolved (depending upon your tribe/camp) from the T to the I (which strikes me as precisely describing your state/dilemma), then read either the Blue and Brown Books and/or On Certainty. Then go to Hillary Putnam, maybe his Rethinking Mathematical Necessity, from his Words and Life collection of essays. (go here for a great essay with a priceless bibliography that is roughly on point: $URL$ Bon Appetit.
