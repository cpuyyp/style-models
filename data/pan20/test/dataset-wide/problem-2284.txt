There's a well-written and comprehensive article on that topic on Best Hiking called "Best Watches for Hiking 2017". 

We've had a harsh weather turnaround lately in central Europe. It went from a pretty warm late summer to a pretty cold autumn in nearly one single night. As this happened, earthworms started to come out of the garden on my terrace (I also found some in the garage and even in the basement). And we are not speaking about a handful. The whole terrace is full of worms of all sizes! I would say about 50 single death animals. They laid down and died (I assume that since I couldn't really observe the whole process). Since I've never experienced something similar before, I wonder what causes this behavior? Why do they do that? 

Lately I chatted with my neighbor while the farrier was there, to provide her horses with new shoes. Later it made me wonder why they even need them. They don't have any in the wild, so why would they suddenly need some metal bars to walk properly? 

So, you've instinctively made everything right. As you've already guessed, you saved your life cause you've controlled your emotion (fear, panic etc.) but the most important thing is that you didn't run! 

In Germany fishermen greet each other with "Petri Heil". I asked myself if this is only a German thing or is it kind of universal (at least in developed countries like EU countries, US etc.) for fishermen? 

The common ski- or sport-shops are in general not that reliable when it comes to snowboarding. The other considerations are summed up in this article from the Austrian board-shop "Blue Tomato": Most important: the size 

I hear people often talk about the "Trail User’s Code" or read about it and ever wondered what it might be. Is it some kind of official act? 

This behavior is well-known to be honest. There's this myth that white-tail activity increases if it rains (the deer seeks shelter). However, the truth is that this doesn't really affect the daily routine. The animal just takes it as something what happens from time to time. As you may already know the two main sense of a deer is its ability to smell and to hear. Both of these senses are nearly blocked while it rains. This is just getting worse if the rain intensifies. The reaction of the deer is easy: compensate this loss with another sense. This, in fact, means, that they want to see. Where do they see? Not in the dark forest but rather in the open fields. I've found a good article regarding this topic: 

Someone has recently mentioned a "bullet tip". I assume he meant something for target shooting but it sounds like some hunting equipment. So, what exactly did he refer to? 

When I slept outside in central Europe, I often recognized extremely loud snoring noises. It's not really rattling but more like rhythmical breathing. I heard it as a kid for the first time and I remember that it scared the hell out of me :) What animal can cause such noises? Worth to mention: a mate once told me that hedgehogs can sleep very loudly. However, as I've researched a little bit, it doesn't seem to be true (but can't really figure out a definite answer). 

The detailed regulations differ from state to state in Austria. Cooking You should use a safe camping stove to cook. Open fire is prohibited in protected areas (official German term "Schutzgebiete") and in the forest. Detailed regulations are very different from region to region. References 

No offence, but if your bow is properly tuned you'll literally feel no difference from field tips to broadheads :) Broadheads intensify any tuning issues. That's why you may experience a supposedly well-tuned field tip and a bad flying broadhead. 

We all know this typical Hollywood hiking backpack with an attached sleeping bag and a dangling camping mug. 

I may want to get a Yate ATS target. However, I'm a little bit concerned that they don't last very long. Do we know approximately how many arrows the material stops before they fly through? 

Last weekend I went to the range with a youngster. Naturally he was very curious and asked me a lot of question. One of them was, why there even was a cock feather which needs to be pointed away from the bow. Well, I had to admit that I don't really know the exact reason for it. So why do we need the cock feather concept? 

Benelli's plant is in Urbino (Italy). It's the only manufacturing site where the final products (so, of course also the R1) are assembled and the final QA takes place. $URL$ So, you don't have to be afraid that it's manufactured in the US or something ;P 

When out in the wild and a companion falls into the fire and gets injured very badly. How can I aid his wounds? Would be great to hear from some possible herbs (natural materials in general) but common camping equipment is also "allowed". 

TL;DR answer The answer is pretty simple for the general rule: take your draw length and add one to two inches. You do that because you might draw a little bit further than your actual draw length. This is pretty dangerous cause the arrow might penetrate the hand which holds the bow! I would recommend to generally add 2 inches for an absolute beginner. This would be 31" in your case. Why?: 

I was there a few days ago. The highest point of the 3D course was 1800 m and starts at 1600 m. Most of the hiking trails however go up to nearly 1900 m and one is even close to 2100 m. 

We're planning a 4 day hike in a few months. I would like to take my bow with me to do a little roving. How can I attach my bow to my backpack (back)? We are talking about a unstrung one-piece traditional hunting recurve. 

Credits: $URL$ Later on you want to "tune" your arrows. It's a process of "taking a little bit off the shaft" and "shoot the shaft". In that case you have a very individual arrow length for a particular setup (setup = bow + arrow + shooter). This is how you do it: $URL$ However, it's not worth worrying about this topic as long as you don't group safely in the size of tennis ball. 

I often read about the "spine" if it comes to archery and arrows in particular. What's meant by "the spine" and why is it so important? 

Long time ago I saw a jaguar (I believe it was one). The strange thing was, that it was extremely dark. I wouldn't refer to it as "black" but actually pretty dark. What does such a color signal? Was it sick, young or just an optical illusion? 

There are several different manufacturers producing so called "lumen nocks". They provide a small light at the end of the arrow. But why? Why would I need a tiny light on my nock? 

However, I wonder how to apply enough heat (at least 120 ° C) to the tube without damaging the feathers? Like a lighter or candle easily ignite the feathers if you aren't careful enough. 

I need to do paper tuning in a few days. Is there any recommendation on how to quickly setup a paper tuning jig? I'm in a shooting range, so I basically need the jig (frame holding the paper) only. 

Nearly every outdoor shoe has this sling on its heel. No matter whether it's a hiking-boot, snowboard-boot or something else. In the left-hand side of this picture for example: 

I've read that one can create a (actually a pretty decent) fridge with quite common materials a few years ago. How do you do that?
