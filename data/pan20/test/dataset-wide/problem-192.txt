There are two important but distinct concepts here: conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. When you talk about absorbing the return force, you're referring to momentum (force is a change in momentum over time). The momentum of a moving object is $\vec{p} = m \vec{v}$, that is, momentum is mass multiplied by velocity. The arrow over velocity means the direction is important here; "momentum going east" is different from "momentum going west". Conservation of momentum means that the total momentum of a closed system should remain constant. If one object loses momentum, another should gain it. This leads to Newton's third law: if I apply a change in momentum to something, it applies an equal and opposite change in momentum to me. Add $+p$ to one thing, add $-p$ to another, and the sum stays the same. Kinetic energy, on the other hand, doesn't have a direction. $E_k = mv^2$. No matter which direction I'm moving, so long as I'm moving, I have positive kinetic energy. Energy is also conserved, but it's much easier to lose it. In fact, the Second Law of Thermodynamics says you have to lose it. Energy can't be destroyed, but it can be turned into a form that's useless to you, and there's no practical way to prevent this from happening. (Though your magic very well could.) For an example: suppose I have two metal balls, each weighing 1 kg. I put them on a straight track, then roll one of them east at 1 m/s, and the other one west at 1 m/s. The total momentum is $p = 1 kgm/s + (-1) kgm/s = 0$. The total energy is $E_k = 1 kg mm/ss + 1 kgmm/ss = 2$. Now the balls collide with each other, and stick together (a fully inelastic collision). So their velocities are both zero. The total momentum afterward is $p = 0 + 0 = 0$, same as before. The total energy is $E_k = 0 + 0 = 0$. Where did all that energy go? It still exists, but it went out into the environment: some of it caused the air to vibrate, for example, making sound. Now, for your magic box. Let's assume the magic box is already charged up with some amount of energy. You take one of my 1kg metal balls, and set it in front of the box. $p = 0$ and $E_k = 0$ since nothing is moving. The box does its magic, and now the ball is flying east at 1 m/s. It's gained momentum of 1 kg meter per second east. But we know the total has to be zero, so something else needs to gain momentum of 1 kg meter per second west. The easiest solution is to give that momentum to the Earth, where it has no measurable effect because the Earth is so heavy. This is what happens to the equal-and-opposite momentum when you walk. But the ball has also gained energy. It now has 1 kg meter-squared per second-squared of kinetic energy. Where did this come from? The obvious answer is: the box. But since this energy doesn't have a direction, the box can't "gain" anything in response. It now has a little bit less magic energy in it than before. So you've expended some stored energy to move an object; in other words, you have a magic gun. A converter of kinetic energy is a wonderful idea, but alas, there is no energy to be regained from recoil. The most you can get is momentum. 

Another issue would be the Hydrogen Sulphide gas (H2S) that is common around volcanic events. For one thing, H2S is an explosive gas. No lights in the castle after dark. No cooking fires, although you've got plenty of lava to cook your food for you. Another thing is that H2S smells bad. It's often referred to as 'rotten egg gas'. You can start to smell it at less than 1 part per million (ppm). That's only a minor problem though. It is also a toxic gas. The 'Short Term Exposure Limit' for H2S is 15 ppm. The smell would cease to bother you after about 100 ppm, as it basically kills your olfactory nerves, permanently ruining your sense of smell. At about 300 ppm, you are pretty much on your way to death, if not dead already. H2S is heavier than air, so it would settle in the lowest parts of the castle. Dungeons and areas enclosed by the wall, rooms on lower floors etc. Nasty stuff. I don't think I'd want to live in that castle. 

Given that a laser beam is made up of coherent light waves running in parallel in the same direction, and that space is not a complete vacuum (dust, radiation, electromagnetic forces etc.), what kind of effective range could a laser weapon have in space? And what form would a laser take, once technology has progressed to the point where a laser is reliably weaponisable? Power requirements and wavelength? Additionally, what form of defense could a spacecraft use against lasers? A mirrored hull? A thick ice shield? I'm assuming an initial contact distance of several hundred kilometers (call it 150 miles if you like), closing as the two combatants approach each other. Is this a realistic expectation? The environment in question is in the asteroid belt and the ship is powered by a nuclear power source. 

Freezing a dying person can definitely help: as the saying goes, "they're not dead until they're warm and dead". The problem is that this causes serious tissue damage (in the present at least). If you just throw Bob into a vat of liquid nitrogen, water will freeze inside his cells and cause them to lyse. So you'll have to be a bit more careful. If he's frozen slowly, the water will leave the cells through osmosis as the ice forms, so you won't have that problem. However, this means you end up with a lot of ice in the space between cells. As this ice expands it will push the cells apart and cause damage to the structure of the tissue, and when the cells thaw they will have lost a lot of water. Also, most chemicals dissolved in the water will not be incorporated into the ice, so the concentration will increase as the amount of liquid water goes down. Not optimal. A small number of animals can survive freezing by replacing some of the water in their body with cryoprotectant (antifreeze) chemicals: waterbears use trehalose, wood frogs use urea and glucose. If you fill Bob's body with cryoprotectants the water will vitrify instead of freezing as it gets colder, avoiding most of these problems. The difficulty now is that most cryoprotectants either don't go through cell membranes, or are toxic in high concentrations. New cryoprotectants are always being developed, so it's not much of a stretch to assume we've found something less toxic by the time we're fighting full-on space battles. Bob's comrades could fill his bloodstream with our fictional new preservative, then freeze him very quickly in a tank of liquid nitrogen. The water in his body would go into a glassy state (hopefully) without causing further damage. Then when they got back to the hospital he could be revived and treated for his injuries. This probably wouldn't be very pleasant for Bob, since it would effectively kill him for a time, but at least he would get better in the end. 

To obtain a lot of energy, it is not necessary to have high voltage. Power = Voltage x Current and Energy = Power x Time Therefore the important thing is the product of the current and the voltage to obtain high energy. That is a tradeoff! Increasing the voltage level is preferred for AC while carrying it to long distances. On the other hand, very low voltages and high current is preferred for the core voltages of the contemporary processors. You have to decide according to the design of your animal. (How fast should the electrical signals rise and fall? How much voltage drop is acceptable? How much should we care about the electromagnetic interaction between very close wires? etc. etc.) 

If four working retroreflectors which are placed on the Moon during Apollo Program would be destroyed, then unfortunately some on-going projects such as measuring Earth-Moon distance, orbit and the attitude of the Moon and several scientific experiments would also be destroyed. 

If we completely ignore the concept 'money' and focus on the mines or raw materials: One of the the primary property of a material making it valuable is it's rareness. But to be able to become a currency and to be used instead of exchanging goods or services, a medium rareness level, I think, is better. (with always very high durableness level) Let's define: Low rareness level: Choosing stone chips as currency is not going to be a good idea as everybody can find tons of them easily. Medium rareness level: Gold is hard to mine but not so hard. One can find gold almost everywhere today and it is not difficult to imagine a world using gold as the only currency. High rareness level: Meteorite for example, is very rare but using it as currency is not possible because it is really rare. Now, if we come to the point of the question; in today's world a Moon rack can not be a currency because it is incredibly rare. Only Apollo astronauts and the unmanned Soviet Luna spacecrafts brought some. However if we have shuttles going to the Moon and bring some racks every day, all day, and assuming the Moon rack is easily be distinguishable from an ordinary rack it can be used as a currency. If we go one step further, if a several hundreds of thousands of people moves to the Moon, then Moon rock can not be a currency for the residents of the Moon, of course, while it can still be used in the Earth as currency. This time, Earth rack may be used as a currency among these very first citizens of the Moon!(This is not a good idea because carrying money is easier then carrying stones but we are assuming a moneyless civilization. (Just for analogy)) Then there will be exchange rates. x units of Moon Rock = y units of Earth Rock. x and y are determined according to the total number/weight of the Moon and Earth Rocks in the other celestial body. Similarly, assuming spaceships can easily and frequently carry materials between planets or moons; a material reaching a medium rareness level in one planet and originated from another planet can be used as the currency. And there will be exchange rates. Or any material, regardless of its origin, can be used as the intergalactic currency if it can reach medium rareness level in all planets. 

An example, at least in terms of the mechanics involved, is the moon. Tidal locking explains this. If you looked at Earth as a star instead of a planet, the moon would always have one side heated, and the other side cooled, as it has one side facing and the other side facing away at all times during its orbit. A night and a day side, with a temperature gradient from one to the other. For an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sol-like sun, the nature of the day/night hemispheres of the planet would depend on how far away it was from the sun. The closer it is to the sun, the larger the heated day side would be, and through atmospheric convection forces, the hotter the night side would be too. At a Goldilocks distance away from the sun (not too hot, not too cold, just right), you'd end up with a band around the planet as a tangent to the orbit, separating the two hemispheres. The temperature within this band could be suitable for life. The hemisphere closer to the sun would be too hot, cooling as it approaches the band. The hemisphere away from the sun would be too cold. So you'd have a permanent day side which is within the temperature gradient suitable for life, and part of a night side which is also suitable for life. Hugh Howey in one of his Molly Fyde books (The Bern Saga series) has a scenario much like this. Half of the world is scorched, the other half frozen. With habitation in a narrow band. Actually, from memory the world in the story had two suns. But the principle would work with only one sun. 

This is definitely possible...but very unlikely. When you have two massive objects orbiting each other, like your stars (let's call them Alpha and Beta), there are five points where a much smaller object (such as a planet) can remain perfectly balanced. These are called the Lagrange points, or the libration points, or just the L-points for short. 

The Gods Themselves by Isaac Asimov This is one of the most complete examples of "different physical laws" I've seen. In the book's parallel universe, the strong force is significantly more powerful than in ours; this means that solid matter can interpenetrate, and life has evolved to take advantage of this. Stars are also smaller and shorter-lived, which is what drives the main plot of the book: the inhabitants of the parallel universe are seeking an alternate source of energy for when their star dies. They end up trading matter back and forth with our own universe, using the difference in the laws to gain energy on both sides: stable isotopes in our universe are radioactive in theirs, and vice-versa, so they can be made to decay back and forth. 

Mental illness such as schizophrenia is diagnosed based on symptoms. If something is causing symptoms truly identical to schizophrenia, it's going to be very difficult to figure out that the underlying cause is different. So something will have to be different. One possibility is that the symptoms are different in some subtle way. For instance, the most famous symptom of schizophrenia is hallucinations. But these hallucinations are usually auditory (hearing things that aren't there), less often visual (seeing things) or tactile (feeling sensations that aren't there, like bugs crawling on your skin). They almost never manifest as smells or tastes. Perhaps demonic possession tends to include hallucinating the smell of brimstone or a bitter taste, along with its other effects. Another possibility is that the underlying cause of demonic possession is easier to test for. Someone who's possessed might react to the touch of holy water or consecrated Host even while unconscious, which a schizophrenic wouldn't, even if they believed they were possessed or had a paranoia of Catholicism. 

The book would have to be written in a language that the recipient could understand. Not just the words, but the concepts. It would need a primer, an explanation of the concepts starting with "This is a copper wire, and this is how you connect it to another copper wire." You wouldn't necessarily have to explain how or why it all works (maybe later in the book), just a dumb diagram with plenty of visual instructions. Concepts such as magnetism would have to be worked around for the motor/generator, but that is easy enough. The lightbulb would be more difficult than the motor (electric motor and electric generator are essentially the same thing). I would guess that an alchemist or a priest would be the best person to hand the book to in medieval times in Europe. The alchemist would be used to working with different minerals and metals, and priests were often the most educated. A blacksmith would be able to help. The moslem world was flourishing during those times, and they had a highly advanced grasp of mathematics and science at that time. During the renaissance, your one-stop-shop would have been Leonardo Da Vinci, the original 'renaissance man'. Jack of all trades, and master of them as well. I think that if the book were written the right way, it would be possible for someone in those times to put it all together. If WW2 prisoners of war could build functioning radios out of bits of junk found around the camps, and people 2,000 years ago could make a battery (although the usefulness of the Baghdad battery is disputed), then it would be possible to build some simple electrical devices. As to who would make the best usage for humanity, I couldn't say. After the Roman Empire, Europe was in chaos. Splintered kingdoms who were pretty much all in it for themselves. But I think Leonardo would be your best bet. UPDATE: Thomas Edison's carbon coated bamboo filament lightbulb might work. He already did the hard work inventing it. Not sure how available bamboo was in medieval Europe (assuming you're thinking about Europe). But you could do the research in your current timeline before sending it back to the past. There must be an alternative available to your intended audience. The vacuum inside the bulb could be more or less achieved. A metal box sealed with wax, and emptied of air by a bank of bellows with non return valves. Might be tough to get a complete vacuum, but you'd get a fair way. Maybe oxen turning a geared wheel linked to a cam shaft to keep the bellows going? Have the bulbs and filaments all set up inside the box. Set leather gloves into the side of the box to work on the bulbs inside. Leather would probably leak air into the box, but keep those oxen moving. Promise them a bonus if they make budget. Using the gloves (they'd need to be tight but supple gloves to counter the ballooning that would happen from the negative pressure inside the box, maybe banded with wire), assemble the bulbs. All you'd need to do is attach the glass bulbs onto the bases with the filaments already attached. One problem would be to attach the bulbs and bases together. With the electricity you are already producing, it might be possible to have a soldering iron inside the box. Otherwise some kind of glue, maybe made from boiled sinew, potato starch, whatever. Edison got around 1200 hours of life out of his bamboo filament bulbs.
