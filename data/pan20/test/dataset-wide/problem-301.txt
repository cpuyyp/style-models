The suffering due to general day-to-day life for most peasants is a consequence of having to do lots of back-breaking agricultural work day-in and day-out. One King cannot invent the time-saving machines and infrastructure that would allow such a society to alleviate that kind of suffering. Nor can the King simply get more peasants so that they individually don't have to work as hard. Just as in modern capitalism, the number of people working the fields is essentially the fewest number they can get away with. More bodies means more cost for the same agricultural return, which now must be divided among more mouths to feed. And that cost will be taken out of some noble's pockets, since the King doesn't actually own those nobles' land. Take it out of enough of them, and suddenly the King will no longer be King. Abuse of peasants comes in two directions: bandits/lawlessness and the nobility. While banditry certainly existed, it's not like it was an epidemic or something. Criminal acts against peasants generally were not tolerated. So there's not a whole lot the King could do to improve things. At least, not without costing a lot more money for relatively little gain. Plus, the nobles might start thinking that the King's trying to undercut their authority in their own lands. As for noble abuse, curbing that would require serious politicking. Most 30-year-olds cannot politic at the level required to effect such change. 

Define "democracy". Leadership of local towns and really local issues were often handled "democratically" by some measures. But if you're talking about significant self-governance, that's not going to happen. Not so long as there is a nobility in place who has all of the de-facto power. 

If you're talking about real lasers, light doesn't really have sufficient mass to redirect such a small object, particularly a fast-moving one before it actually hits you. Sure, light can move objects (see solar sails), but that requires a relatively low mass, large surface area, and a lot of light. Which you don't really have here. The best you could hope for would be that quickly evaporating the metal on one side of the bullet would cause it to be deflected, but even then, that probably wouldn't create enough of a change in direction to cause it to miss. If you're looking for some kind of bullet deflection field, lasers aren't the right answer. 

Then you're boned. The most useful knowledge you would need to survive and thrive in a past era is political skill and interpersonal communication, not "maths and physics". Knowing lots of stuff is useless unless you can convince someone else to do what you tell them. In order to make any significant scientific change, you're going to need to find resources and/or people of importance. You're going to need to find a way to convince them to help you (or more to the point, convince them that you can help them). And when you start helping those people, you need to be able to prepare for attacks from their enemies. You need to be able to walk the corridors of power without a scratch. Only then will you be able to put that "maths and physics" to any real use. That's even true for mathematical improvements. You're going to have to invent zero and convince a bunch of geometry masters to give up everything they've worked for in favor of your calculus. That's not going to go over well unless you know how to influence/manipulate people. You're going to effectively start a reformation movement among the masters of mathematics of their day. And that requires serious leadership skills and the ability to know who's going to join you and who isn't. A single person shifting a society is not an easy thing. And it doesn't happen based on one's knowledge, but on ones political skill. Especially since you're going back into a time which is completely unfamiliar to you. 

The thing about time travel is that generally, the first side who invents it (and is willing to brave the repercussions of making major changes in history) effectively wins. With nukes, both sides had the ability to create them years before either side had the ability to assure the destruction of the other. So if you want a MAD-style stalemate with time travel, you somehow need both sides to invent it simultaneously. Alternatively, one side (or both) could lack the willingness to use it militarily unless they had no other choice, which would allow the other side to develop the tech, leading to a stalemate. 

What does that even mean? Free speech means very little to a populace where the literacy rate is a rounding error and most people live&die in the same village in which they were born. Free practice of religion is going to piss off the local church. Right to privacy is irrelevant to people who live in shacks and don't have very much stuff. And so forth. Most civil rights just don't make sense for the kind of society that these people live in. The most you could do is just strengthen the existing justice system. But even that requires getting the permission of the nobility. And they would make sure that such judicial inquiry cannot be brought against them. 

The thing about science is that you can always fool it. You want the unworthy to be unable to wield it, and you want the weapon to be unwieldable (properly) without being linked. That is more or less impossible. Your weapon needs to have some means to detect the worthiness of the potential wielder. If this is done via genetics, that means that all you need to do to fake being "chosen" is to get the DNA of an actual chosen person and put it on there. For example, by killing the last wielder and keeping their blood or whatever around. A more secure detection of worthiness would be a brain test. That is, direct-neural-interface to the weapon in question. But that can be problematic, since people change. Unless you want "worthiness" to be something which can be gained and lost, it's a problem. Also, whatever DNI technology you're using could be fooled by taking a scan of a "worthy" person and simply playing it back through the interface. If the DNI is part of wielding the weapon (powered armor, for example), then you would simply combine the normal signal from your brain and modulate it to appear "worthy", while still relaying commands. Similarly, weapon locking to a person is some form of security. And all security is crackable. You could try to implant something in the person that the weapon would later detect. But all you need to is remove it from that person and implant it within yourself. You could some some advanced nano-tech or something, but again, you can harvest some of that from the person's blood. DNI-based locking would again be forge-able. The death part is also crackable. When the weapon locks to a user, it must have some way to monitor their life signs. And monitors can be fooled. Implants can be damaged, removed, or destroyed. "Secure" communication methods can be cracked. And so forth. There is no way to make the system you want, using technology, in a way that is foolproof. The "unworthy" will always find a way to wield it. 

MAD happened with nukes because both sides could see a first strike coming with enough time to launch a second strike before the first strike hits. For time travel to have any MAD restrictions, you need a similar ability. So the rules of time travel would have to allow: 

Here's the problem. So you have these "irrational" people who can do magical effects. Sooner or later, someone who isn't "irrational" is going to find someone who can do something potentially useful and then ask them to do something specifically for them. Perhaps payment will be involved. So... can these "irrational" people actually choose what kind of magic they do? Escher could choose what to draw, even if what he drew was unusual. Could Picasso choose what subject to paint? Take your example of bullet deflecting charms. Could such an "irrational" person choose to create them? If so, then they will find employment in someone's army. And by "employment", I mean "do it or die". So if an "irrational" person can choose what kinds of magical effects to create, then non-magical people will benefit from them. And there's no avoiding that. If an "irrational" person cannot choose what kind of magical effects to create, then basically what you will have is modern society, except that every now and them, someone will show up with random powers and abilities that can do incredible things. But since they cannot be controlled, even on pain of death, there will be few lasting effects of them. They might create "works of art", but they would be random, unique, and ultimately useless towards society. But either way, once the scientific method exists and is widely employed, the problem you will have is that they will begin to psychologically study these people. They will start learning how particular forms of "irrationality" causes particular forms of magic. If there is at all a system behind it, they will find it. Eventually. And if there is no system behind it, they will at least catalogue the particular forms of thought that lead to magical talent. And they'll likely catalogue the degree of such thought that leads to the degree of such talent. Either way, they're going to learn something about how "irrationality" affects magic.
