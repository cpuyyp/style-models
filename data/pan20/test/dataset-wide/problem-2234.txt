Putting a ball in it and tying it up will help create a pocket. The problem with that is it usually isn't a very natural pocket. The best way to break in a glove is to play catch with it. It will take time, but it will be broken in to your hand, the way you catch. Depending on the model and brand, it may be more or less difficult to break in a glove. Many of the top of the line gloves will be difficult to break in. This is because of the quality of the leather, they will last longer. Gloves that use faux leather can be up there in price while being softer and easier to break in. Breaking in a glove is pretty serious to a baseball player. Everyone has their own preferences. Whatever feels the best is what you should do. Personally I like a stiff glove. Once it gets flimsy at all, it is time for a new glove. Playing middle infield, I went for a shallow pocket and tried to make the glove an extension of the hand. As for the industry of breaking in gloves... I think it is all trash. The idea is to break down the leather to make it softer. If you want that, buy a cheap glove. I have heard of people putting them in the oven for short periods of time to warm up the leather and then play catch. The oils and mallets and creams are junk, you won't find them being used at a high level of baseball. 

If I understand this question correctly you would like three brackets of five and one bracket of six. With the winner of each bracket having a spot in the semi finals. Here is what it looks like: 21 Team Tournament If the teams are ranked 1-21 then it should be easy to find the pairings. If the teams are not ranked, then draw names out of a hat for the tournament slots. 

Fox Sports Link As for the second part, I have not seen a publicly searchable database with that fine of granularity. 

The short answer is yes they can retain their newly acquired player after the season. That player will become a free agent and can go wherever he chooses. If the team offers him a contract that he chooses, a few things can happen: 

It is hard to speak for a team, know what their strategy is going into a draft. In my opinion the Pirates didn't like certain players in the spot they were picking as much as other teams/scouts may have projected there. For one reason or another they decided that they could save money by drafting another player and paying him below his slotted value. Saving this money may allow them to save money for later rounds, as well as sign undrafted free agents. Here is a story about the Minnesota Twins landing a undrafted player with a lot of potential. No matter where you are picked in the draft, it is tough to make it to the MLB club. Story 

Is this new? What does it mean? If it was an infraction, why wasn't a player thrown out of the face-off? 

The contracts, affiliations, and ownership also apply to the ECHL and CHL. The situation that you describe would most likely refer to a privately owned AHL team that had the player in reference under AHL contract. The rules today may be different than in 1967. Today if the player was under NHL contract the AHL or other minor league team would have no say in the transfer to the NHL club. Lastly as for the franchise finances: If the AHL team is owned by an NHL team, they would be free from worry about operating expenses or player contracts. This would all be the responsibility of the NHL team. This allows for more control over coaching and playing time from the NHL perspective. If they want certain players to play certain positions or minutes then it is passed down to the AHL team. If the AHL team is independently owned, they will be in charge of the operating expenses and the non NHL contracted players on the roster. The AHL team may hire a coach they see fit and player the players the way they want. There are obvious upsides and downsides for both the AHL and NHL clubs in each situation. Here are references used in the answer: About the AHL NHL Minor League Affiliation and Ownership AHL Wiki Art of an AHL-NHL Deal 

I cannot find a quote directly from the NHL, but there are tons of articles online that talk about the rule change. The main reason that is mentioned over and over is: 

Once the timeout was called, the referee blew his whistle and came running in from the sideline. When a whistle is blown the play cannot continue, even though most players didn't know it had blown. This applies to all areas of the game. For example: 

Outfielders have precedence over infielders Infielders have precedence over the catcher and pitcher Catchers have precedence over the pitcher 

As for the OR classification, that means "open race" meaning it is the highest level of racing in the UK. This does not mean that it is open to any participant. When it comes to the "S" vs "A", this distinguishes the race distance. "S" is for a hound that has qualified in a sprint distance. "A" is for a hound that has qualified in a middle distance. There is also "D" for long distance, "H" for hurdles, and "N" for novice. 

On a baseball field you will see a line to the side of the first base foul line. This is the runners lane. A runner my run to first any way he wants (ie inside the foul line, or in an arc on a base hit) but if he is out of the lane and hit by a throw, he is out. If he would have been hit and in the lane he would not be out. There is some controversy on this rule because you will notice the base it to the left of the foul line and the lane is to the right, meaning the runner would have to step to his left at the end to touch the base and stay in the runners lane. 

I think there is a push to get rid of the ball quickly. Due to the reasons you stated. However there are successful QB's that have slower release times than the league average. This article talks about the recent stats in which Peyton Manning and Tom Brady release the ball quickly. I think that translate to success, but there are players that hold the ball longer that have success too. I think it partly has to do with running or scrambling ability. A quarterback that scrambles around for a few seconds and then throws the ball, and does this multiple times a game will increase his average release time. Even though on other plays he might get rid of the ball as quick as some of the quickest guys. Players like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady do not use their legs at all, even to bide time. If they don't get rid of the ball quickly, then they wont be able to extend the play. Players like Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees are not necessarily on the same level as RGIII, Cam Netwon, Colin Kapernick, etc., but they can use their legs to extend the pocket or extend the play. Lastly you have to consider the team as a whole. Can the quarterback and his receivers pick up the defense preplay and decide where the ball is going? Once they decide this can the still be on time? There are a lot of factors that go into it. I think along with ability to run and scramble there is experience and the team you have around you. 

As Paul states, in MLB Rule 5 the umpire will put the ball into play and stop the play. However with runners on base and continuing to advance there would be no situation where the umpire would stop the play. The only way the play would be stopped is if the defense was in complete control of the baseball and the runners on base. Meaning the runners are not advancing or trying to advance. Usually in this situation the defense would then ask for time to be called unless the umpire calls time to change balls, clean home plate, etc. If the defense does not call time, the play may remain live through the next pitch/play. This situation is the same for high school (NFHS) and NCAA. I am not sure how it would apply to lower levels. It is a classic example of the defense throwing the ball around and not being aware of the situation. The offense should not and will not be penalized for that (under correct enforcement of the rules). Note If the player that is put out at second base interferes with the play according to MLB Rule 7 then the play will be stopped and the correct punishment will be enforced. Also note that if the player is put out, continues to the next base and the defense tries to put him out again, if the player is struck with a throw it is not interference so long as he does not make an attempt to get hit. It is the defensive responsibility to leave that runner alone 

If the defense runs a hidden ball trick on a base runner and gets him out, how would it be officially scored? How about a scenario: The defense meets on the mound where the second baseman is given the ball by the pitcher. A runner on second is tagged out while wondering off the base by the second baseman. Is this scored 4U? Is it a caught stealing, a pick off, etc? 

This play would be preceded by calling out a formation. An example is "Green Right Strong Slot Spider Y 2 Banana". Green right strong slot is the formation that the offense will line up in. 

When it comes to actually communicating, players will use different systems. This can be a style that a coach decides on (especially at lower levels than professional) such as calling "ball" or "I got it". If you are teaching this system to younger players it is good to teach the player to call "ball" and for the other players to either call "you" or call the players name. This lets everyone on the field know who is catching the fly ball. Players in the pros may speak different languages and may communicate differently. Usually this would be something that they agree on during spring training as to how they call each other off. Personally, in college we were taught that the infielders call "me" and the outfielders call "ball" as a way of distinguishing who can call you off. They continue calling it until the players near by return with "you" to help avoid collisions. Here is a reference on what I have explained 

Most pitchers will pitch out of the windup when there are no runners on base. It usually helps with the pitchers rhythm. They are able to use a high leg kick and deliver a pitch. Some relievers will pitch out of the stretch whether or not there is a runner on base. This is because they often come in with runners on base and their rhythm is to pitch out of the stretch. As for the stretch, it is used to deter the other teams runners from stealing a base. If the pitcher was in the windup, as soon as he started his windup the runners can steal. If the pitchers stops his windup that would be a balk with runners on base. He can still pick from the windup by stepping off with his foot that is on the rubber. (RHP would step off with his right foot and vice versa for a LHP.) In the stretch pitchers will slide step to deliver the ball quickly to home. This is when they step to home without bringing their lead leg up very far from the ground. Many pitchers can be around 1.2 seconds to home plate with the slide step, giving the catcher a good chance to throw a stealing runner out. Basically the difference is in the time to the plate, which is why all pitchers pitch out of the stretch with runners on 1st and or 2nd. One side note is that with a runner on third some pitchers may choose to pitch out of the windup because in order to get the runner out stealing home, they simply have to get the ball to the catcher. This is a per pitcher and situation type of thing and while not common, it is certainly not rare. Usually there is a slight to mild drop off in the effectiveness of pitchers pitches when they are in the stretch, especially using a slide step. Here is a brief Wiki article that may help understanding 

I would consider putting the bar behind your back leg, essentially under your butt cheek. Here is a short video: ehow.com Riding a T-Bar on a Snowboard 

Here is an ESPN article I referenced. Through dated (2008) the rules as far as one and done, APR, and eligibility have not significantly changed. 

I think any time you teach throwing to children you should try and make it simple and understandable. Some good teaching points: 

A catcher definitely could have an advantage in this situation. A catcher will know what arm slots and pitches that a pitcher will throw. He will know what a pitcher is comfortable throwing in certain counts and to certain players. The reason I say could is because with the amount of video that is out there these days, players have access to as much as they want to learn about a pitcher. They can look at past at bats of their matchup, matchups against similar type hitters, etc. Players are known to spend hours watching video on pitchers, especially ones that they are not familiar with. Many broadcasters and players will say that the difference between AAA and the MLB level is being able to study other players and make adjustments. Many young players will have success and then slump or struggle on the mound because the other teams start getting a pool of video and find the weaknesses.

To answer the first question, according to Fox Sports this is a record (since 1970). Update: Listening to Mike and Mike (ESPN Radio) this morning they quoted Elias Sports Bureau in saying that this is the most home runs through three games in the history of baseball. The previous record through three games was a tie between three players with four home runs:
