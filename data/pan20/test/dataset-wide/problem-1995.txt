Well, for what it's worth - in Germany, it is expected that you are never late. If you know that it can take 40 minutes just sometimes, then you have to get into your car 40 minutes early every time. There is no "well, I'm on time 80%, this is good enough." How you manage to not be late is your problem, not the problem of the company. This is even true for known bad weather conditions. The only exception would be for something really unforeseeable (flat tire, ...). Update I: Anyway, your boss told you that it is important for him. There is a fair chance that you can't lower his expectations - why would he? He pays you. You also can't bring up the problem of your workload right now - if you say:"I have to work even Saturdays." the response will be:"Well, no surprise, you are always late." My suggestion would be to ask for a new schedule. 8:30 am to 5:30 pm. You have much better arguments for that ("Rush hour is making me late rarely. At 7 a.m. I'm still brain dead and of no use.") than for expecting him to let you be late. And..if you are there then at 8:00 a.m. anyway, it's easier to justify that you leave at 5 p.m., because he has seen that you started at 8:00 a.m. Update II: Considering that your job is to help people who start at 8:00 a.m. and who might have a problem at 8:01 a.m., it seems even more reasonable to expect that you are never late, unlike a job where you code in a cellar all alone. If I call a helpline that is open from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. I expect someone to pick up at 8:00 a.m. 

There are three aspect to this that I think bear talking about separately. a. Your relationship with your team members b. Your relationship with you boss/company c. What the end effect is for the customer/client Let's actually go in reverse. c. Without talking about your feelings or how it effects you. How is this effecting your customers and clients(and by extension the profitability to your company)? I can't quantify this but I would recommend that you take some time to try and quantify this from your perspective. This will be helpful when you go to your boss with why this is a problem which leads to... b. It sounds like your company and your boss are happy with you and your work. Going to your boss with 'I feel' statements is dangerous. While your situation is complex and your frustrations are understandable it's also something that can seem like a 'Babu is complaining' instead of 'This is an actionable issue'. These problems seem like a true disaster waiting to happen, depending on the relationship(who leads the project? which company is the 'contractor' in this situation and which is the 'in house' company?) this is something that could potentially damage your company's relationship with your client. I would approach your boss again but this time I would come with direct, actionable issues. If the other team refuses to meet on something - that's actionable. If the other team is holding you to a higher level of accountability then they hold themselves - that's actionable. Come to your boss with both the problem and potential solutions. Your supervisor cannot change how anyone feels, but they can set expectations for a working environment that could mitigate many of these issues. a. This sounds mean but... get over your uncomfortable-ness with the other team. When a member of a team gets fired, it is understandable that they would close ranks. They certainly weren't told by their company why he was fired and they are potentially his friends/peers which means he has probably said some things about why he thinks he was fired(which is probably totally at odds with reality). If my coworker was fired, even for a logical reason and perhaps especially for work-related reason(ie not producing, poor quality output, etc), it would be a pucker moment for me as it would be for most people. Many of their responses, closing ranks, higher scrutiny outside their group, attempting to discredit the person who was part in getting this coworker fired, is natural(if unpleasant) in that light. So how do you deal with it? Their requests for more formal methods of communication is actually beneficial to you and I would embrace it whole heartedly. When you have a question or need a conversation email it. That way there is proof of a time-line when you made the request(in case they don't fulfill it) as well as the methods and professionalism it was made with. Additionally I would recommend pushing for a formalization of the 'contracts' between your teams. What is expected of you and your company. What is expected from them and their company? What do you guarantee to deliver to them, what do they guarantee to deliver to you? These things aren't meant to divide teams(internal teams in my org have similar formal 'contracts') rather they are meant to solidify everyone's expectations("Didn't support enough" isn't a helpful response. "Didn't meet the expectation blah" is something actionable.) Ultimately these 'contracts'(to clarify I mean contracts in a non legal sense but in a expectation setting sense) foster trust between the teams because everyone knows what is expected of them and what they can expect from others. Speaking of teams... In theory you are all on the same team because you are all working on the same product but in their eyes you are now on separate, potentially competing, teams. Don't expect them to have your back and treat them as you would an external but necessary team. The caveat to this is directly in response to "If I take any attempt to learn more about their work they ask why are you interested etc." Because the answer to that is "We are all on the same team, by understanding how you do things I can make all of our lives easier" When it comes to communicating with them and their company "We are all on the same team" is absolutely the attitude you should take. It can be truly frustrating to have others use a magnifying glasses on our mistakes and flaws(or even disagreements on implementations of specific ideas). But this is another thing you can embrace. If you are professional and keeping your boss in the loop about the situation AND demand the same high level of performance from them that they are demanding from you then you should embrace the opportunity to defend and improve your ideas. The trick is to also expect if from them. If they have an issue with something you have done discuss it without ego. Whatever the decision uphold it and push that same expectation forward. Finally. I think it's important that you take a bit of blame for what happened with Sam. Not out loud, not to other people, but internalize it a bit. You mention what Sam did but you don't mention what you did. Did you bring this lack of support, buggy code and issues to your supervisors early in the process. Early enough that something could have been changed? Not doing this is a failing on your part. A much, MUCH lessor failing that "wrote buggy code and didn't support it properly" but still something that you should keep in mind for the future. When a team member fails it is often a failing of the whole team to some degree, and you were part of that team. 

What has fairness to do with it? He does not ask you to contribute to it in your spare time or you will lose your job, does he? You get paid for contributing to the project. 

Let me sum it up: You complain that you don't understand the reasons and benefits for the changes they propose. Then they add you to a meeting, where all these things are discussed and then you complain that you are sitting in a meeting where managers deal with manager things. You can't have the cake and eat it, too. Either you just accept their decisions how to change your software, because they discussed this issue in boring meetings over and over and finally came to a resolution and the only acceptable reason to object is if there is some technological problem. Or you become a manager and discuss and influence the tasks for your software with them, with all the boring and annoying responsibilities. 

Talk to your mentor. Be gentle, do not accuse and be circumspect. Try to figure out what he blames you for and distill, from that, what are legitimate issues with your process. Start pulling away from the mentorship. Start standing on your own. If you can solve a problem on your own, do it(within the appropriate confines of your company's policies of course). Start spreading your questions around to other team mates. Talk to your manager. Both about your feelings about the current atmosphere and in terms of 'what am I doing wrong'/'what am I being blamed for'. Figure out an action plan to resolve these things. Take care of your shit. You probably did do something that slowed the release down(to be honest when a project is delayed there are almost always a billion reasons that can be owned by almost everyone on the project) or you may be doing something annoying(asking your mentor questions before trying to solve something on your own or reasking the same question multiple times). Take care of this, make your own ship ship-shape. Because... Be prepared to move one if things don't improve. Sometimes, for whatever reasons, jobs just start to suck. If the suck doesn't improve, find something better. You have a year of work, a deliverable with a company - you could find something else if it comes to that point. 

I don't think your approach is feasible. Seriously, countries are huge. Even if they would have an open position in the country your girlfriend lives in, how likely it is that it is within a reasonable distance for a real life relationship? I mean, for now you might be grateful to just replace internation flights with national flights, but in the end even a 4 or 5 hour distance will feel crippling after two years. And that's how the person responsible for hiring will likely see it, too, and so consider you a less-than-ideal candidate. Otherwise, I'm not sure what you think will happen when you are worried that things would escalate quickly into personal details. Choosing or changinge the workplace according to relationship requirements is fairly normal. Nobody is going to discuss how often you have to meet your girlfriend to maintain a healthy sex life. What might be discussed is how you see your future within the company considering the above mentioned problems or how you intend to arrange your future so that it matches the company requirements. 

You should leave a review on a site like glassdoor if you can do so as neutrally as possible and if you feel it will not be a detriment to your further career. What do I mean by that? "Did not receive health insurance in a timely fashion" is something you should let other's know about. "Run by deceiving man-babies" is not very helpful on the surface. I mean, let's be honest here, as a prospect I would absolutely want to know both of those but one is inappropriate to a professional review. And that's what you should keep in mind, professionalism. Right now your question comes off as pretty 'ranty'. I think most readers can sympathize but it's not a great review nor is it professional. And, hey, that's cool - sometimes we just gotta rant right? But ranting of this sort is the kind of thing you don't want tied to your reputation because, legitimate or not, it tends to make you look worse than the company in question. So what can you say? "High stress environment", "High attrition", "poor description of job duties", "slow to get health insurance information"... things like this could be part of a discrete, professional review. Try to subtract personal feelings from it and move away from 'deceiving manbabies' and more into a discussion of general problems you ran into. 

Let me answer the question with a provocative counter question: Why should two people who do the same job get a different salary? Let's say Joe can craft 300 Gorgels in 6 hours. Bob can craft 200 Gorgels in 6 hours. Both do their very best though. Now Joe decides to work 4 hours and chill 2 hours. Should Joe be paid for 6 hours, because he gets as much finished as Bob or should Joe be paid 4 hours only, because he only works at 66%? And finally - who do you praise? Joe, for getting in 4 hours the job done or Bob for working at 100%? There is no satisfying solution that involves a public performance review. When you praise Joe, Bob will be unsatisfied because even 100% is not enough for you. When you praise Bob, Joe will be unsatisfied because his output is higher than Bob. The solution to the problem is to praise Bob in private for his dedication and to find ways together to improve his output; and to praise Joe in private for his superior output and to find ways together to improve his dedication. And all this already starts from the premise that you are actually able to properly and accurately judge the overall performance of Joe and Bob. Now imagine you don't know that Joe spends 2 hours slacking off, nobody told you. And then you start praising his dedication for the company in front of everyone. 

Here is a question that you've not answered: Does the change you are proposing fix a typo that could potentially cause confusion down the road? You've mentioned that you point out "typos to do with internal acronyms and terms". And in some cases I can see the importance of correcting a typo. If there are two internal acronyms, ABC and ACB and someone in the meeting uses the wrong one then potentially(if there is no context perhaps) this could lead to confusion. But honestly? This part of my answer will be split into two parts. The first involves meeting notes that are meant to be post processed and distributed or involving communication outside your team and work. The second involves internal, 'meeting minutes'. Let's go with the first. If a group in a meeting is working together on a document that will be released externally than everyone in the room should be on point in catching and alleviating typos and poor communication. These materials are unique because, ultimately, they will represent the organization to the outside world. There is a responsibility, in this case, to speak up about any ambiguity or mistakes. In this case you, and everyone else in the room, is absolutely in the right to correct, gently if possible, any mistakes. The second? Well the second situation is where you kind of come off looking like a jerk. Internal, informal meeting minutes for casual meetings are just that: informal, internal and casual. Things that do not accurately represent the meeting should be called out. Say if the meeting agreed to do XYZ and the meeting minutes say "By consensus the group has agreed NOT to do XYZ" Otherwise? You're showing off whether you realize it or not. Whether it is your intention or not you are attempting to show how much more you know/notice/etc than the person taking the notes. If it bothers you that much? Take the notes yourself. Is anyone else in the room suggesting fixes for typos? Really think back over the last few meetings - how many times has everyone in the room spoken up? Of that, for each person, roughly what percentage was to correct typos in the meeting minutes? This is how you can guage how your regular 'corrections' are being taken. There is an important lesson all developers and IT have to learn eventually and that is the lesson of 'Good enough'. You are, absolutely, putting your working relationship with other people in the room at risk every time you recommend a 'correction' and for what gain? Do these notes live on forever, being referenced back constantly? Or are they like most meeting minutes where they get dumped on a network drive, emailed out or on a sharepoint in order to show that, yes, things happened in the meeting? What is the real benefit, other than scratching your typo itch, that these corrections provide? Imagine, for a moment, if you were working in a room and every time you made a minor, unimportant, mistake a specific person called you out. You open the cmd instead of the server console or something minor, unimportant, otherwise unnoticeable and, immediately, this other person calls you out. "You're doing that wrong!" How would you feel about that person? Especially, perhaps, if there were others in the group who did not point those things out? Some folks who read this may be adamant that they would be thrilled to have their mistakes pointed out but, let's be honest here - no one likes to be called out. No one likes to be called out on minor, unimportant things. No one likes to be put on the spot(typing in front of a group) and called out on minor, unimportant things on notes that may never be seen again. You have a couple of possible solutions here. First - if the typos bother you so badly why haven't you volunteered to take the notes? Be polite, even joking: "I'm super particular about typos, do you mind if I take the notes?" You may be unaware of the challenge of actively participating in a meeting while taking public notes. Or, alternatively, suggest spreading it around. Let everyone take the notes. If, for whatever reason, that isn't a possibility take a break on commenting on typos and watch other's reactions to those typos. See if other's feel they are important enough to comment, see how they do so, get a sense of the culture of correcting others in your group. 

(I will not focus on how to prevent the situation, as this is not the question. But of course preventing a bad situation is better than trying to fix it.) Let's try to approach this one methodically. Why would your superior make an incorrect statement? He does not know better. Does it matter and will be result be unalterable when the meeting is over? The answer is usually "No.". Any decision can be revoked due to "new" information. So it is sufficient to update your superior with your information after the meeting. If the answer is actually "Yes.", then politely state your information. The listeners will realize themselves that your statement contradicts your superior, no need to rub everyone's nose in. If nobody would want your input, you wouldn't be in the meeting. He does know better. If he does know better, yet states something else, it luckily doesn't really matter why he does it. He has a reason and your public correction will go against his agenda, no matter if his agenda is a good or bad one. He believes so much in his agenda, that he does not mind to be flexible with the truth. In such a case, correcting your superior means he will be pissed off and you gained nothing. If you update the superior after the meeting with your information and he does know better, nothing bad will happen. He might tell you the reason, he might pretend that he didn't know better but that it is "not important" enough to revoke the decision now or he might tell you to care about your own stuff. So, reviewing all the possible paths, it's easy to see that you should not say anything in the meeting, unless absolutely necessary and always update the superior with your information, because no matter what the reason was, it will end up the best way - if you couldn't prevent the situation. As a side note, if your superior states something incorrect or dumb in a meeting, you can just raise your eyebrows (this of course requires the right seat). If they are good and it is the first case scenario, they will catch this and continue with something like:"but I'm no expert on this. What is your opinion?"
