Was in the time and place when Jesus preached, common for someone to do so in the manner Jesus did it? (Of course, Jesus was unique, even from the point of view of someone who completely disbelieves everything about the religious views about being the Messiah. He played a very important role in defining our culture, society and value systems. This question tries to limit itself only to the aspects of the local culture and customs of that era from a secular point of view) So, let's reconstruct the image of a man, not too old (so not conforming to the "wise old mentor" archetype), who moves from town to town, has a very small group of loyal disciples always traveling with him, who holds religious sermons but is not part of (and does not respond to) the priestly hierarchy, but still seen by most people as having a vast and correct knowledge of the religious law. He gathers hundreds, and sometimes thousands of listeners while holding speeches. They do not gather any worldly possessions (land, buildings, infrastructure) besides what is strictly needed for day-to-day survival. He spends a lot of time helping the poor or at least comforting them. Many people start viewing him as a prophet, or even as the fulfiller of an old prophecy. The above is just a small summary, take further descriptions about Jesus and the disciples strictly as presented in the canonical Gospels. Having done that, let's look at the non-biblical sources and what we know about the customs and culture of that time and place. Was it common or very uncommon for such preachers to be active there? Do we have sources about other people living like that and preaching like that, besides Jesus and maybe John the Baptist? What I would like to take a look at, is that from the perspective of a man who lived in that place and time, listened to one or a few public speeches of Jesus (but was not a disciple or a closer associate), and later, after Pentecost, might have joined this new movement which later developed into Christianity, how would this person have viewed what he saw and heard? Was it likely that he listened to many similar preachers before, who were leading a similar lifestyle, preaching, traveling etc. by similar means and it was just Jesus whom he had seen as much more convincing than the other ones, or was it very likely for Jesus to be the first such person in his life? Please note, again, that this question is not about whether it is true or not what specific religions teach. It's solely about whether we have any sources about other contemporary people having similar lifestyles and activities as Jesus is described to have had. 

How can we explain the fall of Buddhism in India, which is the geographic origin of Buddhism? Were there ever any direct conflicts between Hinduism and Buddhism? From what I understand, the rise of Hinduism directly led to the decline of Buddhism. The White Hun invasion in the 6th century followed by a series of other military invasions and conflicts definitely hurt the influence of Buddhism but these events seem disjoint and regionally limited. From wikipedia, what exactly does this mean? I am not satisfied with this explanation because Buddhism is strongly rooted in other Asian societies. "By that time, Buddhism had become especially vulnerable to hostile rulers because it lacked strong roots in society as most of its adherents were ascetic communities." $URL$ 

Emperor Kangxi, especially towards the latter part of his reign, firmly believed that China was in a secure economic position and the treasury was adequate. To stimulate economic activity, he froze all head taxes, (tax based on population count). This was also done because he wanted a more accurate census from local officials, who tended to under report in order to pay less taxes. By freezing this head tax, did Kangxi unknowingly trigger an unsustainable population growth? Or did he simply get a better head count without further consequences? Were there any significant consequences to this action? 

In the era of muskets and closed troop formations, musicians marched together with the solders and played marching music even during the battle. When was the last time such practices were used in battle? In the USA Civil War they were certainly used, and I would guess in WW1 they were no longer used. Is it possible to narrow it down even further? I would guess the 1870 war was technologically not too much different from the American Civil War. Could that be the answer? 

When we analyze an earlier time period, we have to take care to also study it from their own perspective, taking into account all the socioeconomic factors and all the constraints of the level of technology they had back then, and its effects on daily life. Judging them solely from a modern, (or even utopistic) viewpoint only leads to finding them either bizarre or evil, just like how they would view us if they didn't understood all the context which made our current civilization look like it is. 

What other languages has a high likelihood of turning up in first century (or more specifically, between roughly AD 30 and 40) Jerusalem? 

Trying to dig up the specific reactions of the general public from that time period would be very difficult, if not impossible. But judging from the attitude of the time period there was probably not an "outrage" as we would define it today. For similar projects I've looked at old newspapers from the time period and looked for editorials. Usually there aren't any because the press was arguably "less free" at the turn of the century. The early 20th century was truly the last days of colonialism (so-called modern colonialism is usually metaphorical language). Public opinion was shifting but it was a gradual change. Many European countries were beginning to relinquish their colonies but there were many voices on both sides of the argument. So I doubt the public thought much about it, genocides of Africans by Europeans was not uncommon.I don't think he was relieved of command because of this one incident. Finally there is some interesting evidence from today. This BBC article says that descendants of Von Trotha apologized to the Herero chiefs while government officials still do not apologize officially. I find that rather strange but often governments don't like apologizing retroactively or at all. "The German government has expressed "regret" at the killings, and a visiting minister apologised in 2004 in general terms, but she avoided specifically saying sorry for the massacres. " 

It was in a time period where history and mythology cannot be fully separated from each other, so its authenticity might be accepted by some, and debated by others. Only 6 people took part in the fight proper. However, both armies (likely above 1000) did meet each other on the battlefield, and only there was it proposed to decide the battle with a trial by champion. So, depending on how we define "battle" and "fight", this might or might not count. 

Not only is the German school dominating modern European martial arts, but almost everyone who talks about late medieval fencing refers to German fencing manuals as the primary source. Why are German fencing manuals the most well-known today? The Italian states were also well developed by that time, and Spain and France were also famous for their well-trained armies and skilled swashbucklers. However, today even martial artists form those countries refer mostly to the German manuals and use German technical terms, instead of their own. What contributed to the German school of fencing to become so dominant? Was it also dominant in its own time (Germans were used in a lot of armies as mercenaries), or is the major cause that just more books have been written (Germans did invent the printing press after all) or more books survived? 

I can't believe no one mentioned The Search for Modern China by Jonathan Spence. It is a rather long book and covers a longer time period than asked for by the OP. He is a very good writer who can synthesize the story and the main idea behind historical events. His writing is very easy to read yet also academic. It is the book to have if you want a general understanding of recent Chinese history and politics. The book spans 1600s to 2000 but I think to understanding the events leading up to the 20th century one must step back a few centuries to examine China's opening up to the rest of the world and the collapse of dynastic rule. 

Indians were living in Fuji because Fuji was a British colony and many Indians were brought to Fuji as indentured laborers or servants. This established a sizable Indian population. Through elections the originally native Fujian government became a multi-ethnic entity. The coup was quick and took place without resistance, the prime minister Timoci Bavadra and the parliament were deposed. The long term consequence of the coup was a gradual migration of ethnic Indians, resulting in a loss of skilled labor and ultimately dealt a blow to the economy. 

You storm it. You have tens of thousands of men, they have at most a few hundred. However, due to the strategic position and construction of the castle, storming it would be very costly. In the few cases an army in a hurry did do it, it was not uncommon to suffer ten times (or much more) casualties than the defenders. It would almost always be a Pyhrric victory. You besiege it. You start bombarding it until you can breach the walls and can storm it with much less casualties. However, it takes a lot of time, weeks or maybe months, meanwhile you have to delay your main objective. The enemy has time to organize. If winter comes, you probably have to retreat home, and instead of capturing a rich city, you only got an insignificant little fortress. You ignore it and go around. In this case, they will raid your supply caravans. Your large army needs a lot of food, gunpowder, etc, and leaving a fortress behind will make it harder for you to resupply. You will either lose supplies to them, or you need to guard your supplies which takes manpower out of your main army. Long campaigns were almost always decided on supplies.
