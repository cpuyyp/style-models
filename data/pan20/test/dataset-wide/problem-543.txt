Your rear derailleur is compatible with upto 26t. So there is a limit there. Apart from that I'm really not sure what is exactly compatible with what. If possible you should go to your LBS and ask for advice. 

Did I already say you should really see a professional? This isn't normal at all, and really sounds like something you should have checked. Get your bike set-up properly. Go to a local bike shop to some help, or google around for something like this. Note that it is very much possible that your bike is too small or too large for you, in which case there is nothing to do but get a bike better suited to your size. Fast or heavy pedaling? You should use your gears! Optimal pedaling frequency is around 80-100 rotations/min. Lower than 60 puts a serious strain on your joints. If you can actually produce useful force above 140 I applaud you but that speed is also inefficient and strenuous. Try to change gears more often, if you need to go lower or higher than you can regularly then get lighter and/or heavier gears. Did you recently increase the amount of cycling you do? Though mostly a low-impact sport cycling can still cause injuries, and you should increase your workload slowly over several weeks or months depending on your age. Seriously, go see a professional. 

The way the human body reacts to training means that fitness will improve most dramatically if you exercise every two or three days. You would improve your times the most by commuting one extra day each week, and also going for a spin each weekend because you'd become a lot fitter. This is free but it will cost you some time. 

There is no scientific evidence that food/water/electrolyte intake beyond what your body requests (through hunger/thirst/fatigue) helps, but it is important to keep eating and drinking during rides to replenish the resources you use. Finally, there is some evidence that stretching the muscles you expect to spasm/cramp during the race but before they actually start to do so helps. 

You are not a very experienced cyclist, riding a fixie in traffic is actually not that easy. No fenders, so dirty clothes/mud in the face on rainy days. No rear-rack, so for luggage you are forced to use a backpack. 

A weather dependent strategy is available when there is a stiff crosswind. Your wind shadow (i.e. the place where a drafter would want to ride) is "behind" you from the point of view of the wind you experience. You experience wind from straight ahead because you are going fast, and from the side because of the weather. The combined effective wind will come at you under an angle somewhere between those two directions. With a sufficiently stiff sidewind your wind-shadow will be off the side of the road if you ride all the way on the downwind side, meaning drafting is impossible. 

That said: If I lived anywhere where the were hills higher than the bridges over the canals I would probably never use it. p.s. I have something like this only mine is (and looks) about 30 years old (the frame anyway): 

I would find a nice secondhand bike that looks like the fixie you link but has fenders, a rear-rack and proper brakes. 

They are GPS trackers with a wireless data connection, GSM or EDGE would be enough for the data rate, but it might be something faster. The company supplying them is Dimension Data you can sign up for a free data report at the end of each stage here. 

I don't know about the security, but the hiplock does look easy to carry while cycling. No extra weight on the bike, just some extra weight on your hips. 

I'm with Batman in that you should contact a medical professional. This sounds way too serious to trust to what some random people on the internet say. However, if cost is an issue there I can make some suggestions about some things you can do to prevent some common bike-related injuries in the future (after you see a professional or did something else to get rid of it). 

As a year-round bicycle commuter I can tell you that without a doubt a belt-drive combined with an internally geared hub is way more efficient with my time than a chain could ever be. I loose maybe a few seconds over my 15km (one way) commute (if that) but I gain hours by only having to hose my bike down every other week rather than cleaning and re-oiling my entire drivetrain every few days. 

I've tried a backpack, but that violates point 3 and (somewhat) 5. Also, it is sweaty and bad for my back. I've been looking into the various bags that attach on top of a rear-rack such as the ortlieb trunk bag and the topeak trunk drybag but they are too small. Topeak has bigger models but those have a strange compartmentalisation, and they are not waterproof (since you can buy separate rain covers). I'd like to avoid the asymmetry of a single panier, and I'd also like to avoid attaching a full rear-rack to my roadbike. Seatpost-mounted rack is fine though. Edit (2014-12-01): In the end I decided to go for a backpack, the ortlieb packman pro 2 to be exact. Reasons: 

One option I don't yet see between the excellent answers above is this: If you have fixed the wind issue you still lose a lot of heat in your hands through your handlebars. The rubber grip usually provides some insulation, but the metal of your handlebars is highly heat-conductive and constantly getting cooled by the entire bike. So in cold weather you are constantly holding on to a frozen stick that is very good at conducting heat away from your hands. Some additional padding on the handlebar side of things can greatly reduce that. Cork, or cork-like materials are very good at it. Unfortunately most options a know of are not very durable, so they'll only last a winter or so. Windstopper gloves and better handlebar insulation keep my hands warm in subzero temperatures where just the gloves were not enough. 

I think you pretty much nailed the main issues regarding fit and hearing the surroundings. True in-ears are a hazard if you keep the volume too high. One issue I missed you your discussion is sweat resistance. I don't know how long your commute is, but depending on length and effort I find that I eventually get my headphones wet, and I found headphones are not taking this well, even most of those advertised as "sports" headphones. My experience so far: 

Get a rearview mirror if you don't have one already. This will allow you to anticipate better, and with some practice you can learn to compensate for the wake by slightly leaning away from the car just as the car passes you. I have cycled around new zealand where all you get is highways. Log and sheep trucks are an absolute horror when they pass at speed on narrow sections. I even got sucked onto the road a few times in the wake of a truck. After I got a rearview mirror I was able to time leaning away from the truck at the moment the wake washed over me so I could prevent that. Apart from that, having the rearview mirror meant I was more relaxed on my bike because I could see without looking over my shoulder if the truck driver had noticed me and was staying off of the shoulder. (which sometimes was not the case, but that is a different story). 

As far as I know carbon is most prone to catastrophic failure of all frame materials. Depending on the type of separation you see it could be a bit dangerous to keep on using your bike as is. The catastrophic failure occurs because the epoxy becomes brittle over time. A new layer will probably extend the life of your frame just by protecting the original epoxy from the elements. However, it will also hide the progress of the degradation of the material underneath, so you won't be able to monitor the extent of the degradation. I'm not sure you could repair your frame to the extent that the new layers will be strong enough to replace the old ones. But I'm not an expert, so I could be very wrong. Maybe your best bet is to send these guys a picture of the damage and ask them for their professional opinion. 

I think I'll ride to the car wash every weekend or every other weekend depending on conditions. This takes me, including cleaning my chain and re-oiling everything after the hosedown, about 35 minutes including the 5k one-way ride to the car-wash. Pretty good! 

Get thick Neoprene cycling shoe covers. I got these last winter after two years of cold feet (pun not intended) and they are wonderfull! 

First things first: A belt is probably slightly less efficient than a properly installed clean chain. The test you link already indicates that. Probably with the tension Gates requires you'll loose a bit more power. On to your question: The chain is 200 grams heavier than the belt, of course with the chain you get gears, which you don't get with a belt unless you also install an internally geared hub, which changes the weight of the entire drivetrain heavily the other way, but lets disregard that for now. You loose 200 grams, and you loose 1 watt. From how big a pool do you take that watt? Just to grab something, take a number from here for a cyclist doing a timetrial of 10 miles in 30 minutes: 157 watt. So this means 1 watt is a loss of about 0.66% for a reasonably fit recreational cyclist. Given that a reasonably fit recreational cyclist weighs about 80kgs, has a bike of 10kgs, and is carrying 3kg of clothing, gear and filled waterbottles, the 200grams (0.2kg) you save translates to about 0.22% weight loss. So we can already conclude that the weight gain would never compensate for the efficiency loss. However, when going at any sort of speed, weight is not the factor holding you back, air resistance is. So unless you only bike up the steepest parts of HC climbs in your riding the reality is that the weight loss from a belt drive will never compensate for the efficiency loss. As far as I can see, the reasons for switching to a belt drive (probably combined with something like a rohloff speedhub) are:
