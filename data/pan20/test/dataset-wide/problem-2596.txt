Tirokudda Kanda (as well as dharmafarer.org's traslation of Tirokuḍḍa Sutta) mentions doing this for the benefit of the dead. Meritorious acts cause positive telepathic vibes which can help betterment of the dead especially if the see and rejoice in the meritorious acts we do. So this does not look out of place as a later composition. It is the merit that is given not the food. Also even if you leave out food this can be of some enjoyment to the spirits. Say a person liked a certain type of food and you leave it out. His spirit would naturally be attracted to it through he cannot physically partake it. As I see this is not what is mentioned in the Sutta, but the transfer of merit. Transfer of merit works in two way: 

First of all seek the advice of your teacher as mixing other techniques which might not work well with the techniques you are practicing and your teacher will not be able to guide you regarding complication of what you have mixed into your techniques. 

You should view this more in terms of psychic abilities (Abhijñā) and Jhana. Though astral projrction is not explicitly referenced as a ability. There are instances where you can have multiple copies of your self in different places. What you can achieve through Jhana is unthinkable. Also our minds will be going to Jhana like state in near death or sometimes during other experiences, which bring out certain abilities. 

Whatever is dependently arisen and Nirvana is not self / non self, i.e., all dhamma is not self / non self. Volition is dependently arisen hence not self / non self. Volition being dependently arisen it is not entirely controllable as arising and passing of volition appears when a conducive condition is present and disappears when the cause ceases. Volition is not entirely out of our control also. When you experience something pleasant or unpleasant you can react with craving or aversion which is the general pre conditioned response or you can be equanimous and be aware of its arising and passing nature.

If you have wise attention (equanimous and seeing the 3 universal characteristics), then only then you get shielded from any harmful agent from the outside world. 

Best is divide your time into 2 sessions. One in the morning and one in the evening / night. The rationale is some time if you are overcome by hindrances in one session the other will be productive. Also some mediators are more fruitful in certain hours of the day, but grain this vary from day to day. So splitting it up is a good idea. Also you need to rub two sticks for some time to get to a critical temperature. So a meditation session should be long enough to gain some critical mass. Ideally 2 hours in total per day is a good time. 

The right way to earn a living is a way which does not harm yourself or others and have a moral basis. Avoid ways to earn a living without lies, deceit, killing, debauchery, etc. 

Hence we not completely enslaved nor are we completely free from it. We have some degree of choice but not absolute choice. (Refer to marks of existence) 

Saṅkhitta Dhamma Sutta Also one should abandon fabrications. [Samma Ditthi Sutta] One such fabrications is thinking and pondering. [Cūla Vedalla Sutta] Beyond the 1st Jhana you can cut this out. Also thinking and pondering leads to latent tendencies (see: Anusaya by Piya Tan). Suppressing it thinking and pondering suppresses concept proliferation which in turn suppresses the latent tendencies. The Jhana also suppress the 5 Hindrances. 

A more detail explanation of the Sutta is available in Mindfulness with Breathing: a Manual for Serious Beginners, 2nd edition which does a wonderful detailed explanations. (Don't use the 1st as this is a poor translation.) In addition there are some lectures by Budddhadasa Bikkhu: Anapanasati by Ven. Buddhadasa. For the very basics have a look at: Mini Aanapana. Also 

Metta meditation will enable you not to suffer on the account of other. Each time you generate dislike you generate misery for yourself. Though Metta mediation if you manage to stop your metal reaction of other with negativity this will help you also to be happy without irritation. Following answer has more detail of the practice. 

Source: The Dhamma Theory Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma by Y. Karunadasa Formulating a thesis or research ideas involve conceptualisation. Also these have to be expressed or communicated as finding or publication. More on this is as follows: 

Bhanga is the experience of total dissolution of the body and not necessary ego. Everywhere in your body you experience arising and passing. This experience can be vivid like vibration, bubbling, electric pulses running through you body, or even feel the body is a cluster of particles caught in brownian motion like vibrations. 

Pahāna Sutta In addition the 6 sense bases can be the source of these sensations which result in unwholesome roots: 

You should anchor your mind on a chosen object so that your do not think hence creating metal fabrication. (Cūla Vedalla Sutta) But if your main drifts to thoughts or the past or fantasy 1st look at the thoughts in your body with full equanimity looking at their arising and passing. If you have any unpleasant feeling pay attention for a small duration until such sensation become neutral or pleasant, then continue with your chosen object. Ultimately you have to be equanimous to whatever sensation you experience realising its arising and passing nature. (Pahāna Sutta) 

I do not think the generation gap has anything to do with Karma. This is more to do with social, technological and attitude changes. 

Wisdom Wide and Deep: A Practical Handbook for Mastering Jhana and Vipassana by Shaila Catherine covers all 40 meditation objects / types and is more accessible than the Vissudhi Magga. In general other books in the Pa Auk tradition covers all 40 subjects of meditation as this is part of the training though finally may settle on what works best for you. (This is one fully contained book covering all the Theravada meditation subjects.) If you are interested in Anapana (limited to Anapana) have a look at: Mindfulness With Breathing : A Manual for Serious Beginners which is a very good book to read which covers all 16 steps of Anapana. If you are looking for general Vippassana (limited to Vippassana) practice have a look at: The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation (should be complimented with the instruction in the course) or Beyond the Breath: Extraordinary Mindfulness Through Whole-Body Vipassana Meditation (this discusses some question and issues people may face - but keep in mind evey one is unique, hence what you may face maybe different). But best is that you complement this with a course which you can apply through: $URL$ 

When you are under attack this environment is conditioned by perhaps past Karma. At this point you are agitated as you are under attack. Loosing the balance of you mind will hamper your cause of action to get out of the situation. The best is to use a clever tactic or flee. If not perhaps attack but without hatred. (I guess in martial arts this is what is advocated.). Try keeping your calm by watching your breath and sensations. You can use the sensation you experience in such a situation to eradicate your past stock of Karma. When the situation was created your past karma is bearing fruit. If you do not create new karma by reacting to the sensation you experience in the situation you are not creating new karma which might bring about similar situations in the future. Also try some Metta towards them. This way you are handling the situation within the path. See @ChisW's and @ruben2020's answer to compliment. 

The Buddha taught about unsatisfactoriness and the way out of it. The biss of Nirvana surpases all. So you practice Buddhism to come out of misery. Initially you will find sensation based bliss like Piti and Sukha and finally Nirvana which does not depend on sensations. So in a way this is right. 

Initially when some unwanted thing happens you get angry. The subject of anger can be towards a person of situation you are in. The 1st the initial experience cases your 1st unpleasantness (i.e., you get angry) and then subsequently through proliferation or thinking and pondering on the experience, how you could have handled it, how you would retaliate, etc. keep you in misery or sustains the unpleasantness (in this case your anger). If you are angry or unpleasant due to what someone has done then you keep rolling in anger when you think "x did y to me". Here you have a notion of a doer and you the receiver or experiencer or some other association. When it is a situation you still may have the self identification as experiencer or receiver or some other association with the situation. Now this can be due to your Karma and also the experience of what was done maybe in the past. Dwelling on this makes anger into feud if it is to do with a person. Contemplating this as past Karma, disidentification of the action from the identity of self as oneself and the other person or people, contemplating that situation will not last for even and subjected to change, also contemplating that there is no entry who did this and no entity who experienced this and whoever perceive has the doer has changed and no more and whoever you perceive as the experiencer has also changed and no more, etc. can help reduce this. Here the remedy is at rectifying the perceptional or the view which cases anger to arise. At a more advance stage you can contemplate on the sensation this bring. You have a Perceived ideal as in how you should be treated or an ideal situation you should be in which what you experience deviates from then this results in unpleasantness. Similarly for when a pleasant situation or treatment changes and finally when you are in a situation or treatment which you do not evaluate positively or negative hence which is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Though this you study the full sphere of sensation (vedana) or unsatisfactoriness (dukkha). This is more or a permanent solution whereby you eradicate the roots which case this type of unpleasantness and your bondage to becoming which can cause future experiences of such nature. This is easy said than done for and also influenced by personal temperament. 

At Bhanga you start seeing anicca but this is not realization, though some teachers teach it as such, but a step before realisation.

You reap what you sow. If your motivations was to frighten people Karmic consequence might be to be the author gets frightened also. If your motive is profit as expence of reader getting deluded, start craving, being lustful, being averse or frightened (aid the arising of the unwholesome roots) the expected karmic consequences may not be so good. If your motivation is to send a constructive message then it might not be bad Karma after all. It might not be the ending that matters buy what motivates you to do it. Perhaps a book to teach Karmic consequence in the lower realms may not be a bad idea after all if you are thinking about writing. Khuddaka Nikāya's Petavatthu (and even perhaps Vimānavatthu) section may be a motivator for such stories. Also the working of Karma is complex so it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
