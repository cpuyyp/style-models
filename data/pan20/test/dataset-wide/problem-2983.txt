The word color has 3 different definitions, depending on context. When speaking about the color of an object, we're referring to a property of the object. Which wavelengths of light it absorbs or reflects. When we speak about the color of light, we're referring to it's wavelength or the combination of wavelengths from which it is comprised. When it comes to visual perception, we're referring to hue. So a red balloon (property) under blue light (wavelength) appears black (hue). Light has no hue, but it does have different wavelengths, which result in the perception of corresponding hues. 

The idea is that if everything in the universe can be determined precisely then it's unlikely free will exists but if even the universe has different possibilities then we probably have free will too. Please note, this is not my belief, just how some people view it. 

As Chief Sealth said, "All things are connected." If a particular theory explains X, we might indeed be left to wonder if X could be explained by yet another theory. But suppose we also develop theories that explain Y and Z - and there's no conflict between our theories. Better yet, suppose these different theories appear to support each other. If you have literally thousands of theories that explain countless phenomena, and everything appears to fit together, then you've created what you might call a framework. Now, let's say we take one of your "infinite number of other theories" and plug it into X. Even if it appears to be a tenable theory in isolation, does it mesh with all the theories explaining other phenomena? Things like electricity, the internal combustion engine and medical science aren't just a function of theory; they have to actually work - and they do work. So why would anyone want to rewire a country's electrical grid based on some whimsical philosophical theory? Only a fool would suggest that science is 100% accurate, and, in a philosophical vein, one might question everything science has taught us. But when it's time to eat, get dressed or buy a home, most people are going to trust science over philosophy. Which isn't to say they're in competition. I subscribe to the view that philosophy is a tool or discipline that helps us understand things that scientists can't examine. To put it another way, science might be thought of as the study of the known, while philosophy is the study of the unknown. 

Let's use a current dilemma I'm facing. Is visible light, visible? Replace (God) with (visible light) and (The bible) with (insert a dictionary of your choice), and it's the exact same situation. Most of the answers I'm getting are along the lines of: (It's called visible light. Visible implies that we can see it. Therefore we can see light.) It's hard to argue with such logic. But my argument is not, about the definition of visible. My argument is whether light itself is actually visible. What are the factors which determine whether an object is visible or not. Why is this particular type of light, called visible light. I'm in no way saying that a visible object is not visible. It's this circular reasoning which prevents people from seeing the question I'm actually asking. Your question is open to interpretation. You need to explain your argument to specifically exclude irrelevant interpretations. 

Is there a philosophical term for fear of the unknown, other than xenophobia? If such a term doesn't exist, can you think of a philosopher who discussed the phenomenon? EDIT I should probably define "unknown." I'm including things we simply have no knowledge of; for example, what lies beyond the borders of the universe? It could also include questions like what is death, or what's going to happen to me after I die? The unknown could thus include things we are vaguely aware of but which we don't fully understand. 

The answer is simple: Yes and No. People who perform good deeds are certainly rewarded with the good feelings that come from doing good deeds. They are also likely to be esteemed and supported by the community. On the other side of the coin is the adage crime doesn't pay. Criminals are often caught and prosecuted. Even those who aren't caught may be forced into hiding or may suffer from a "guilty conscience." However, those are generalizations. In the political arena, crimes pays big time. Corrupt politicians can exploit and even murder millions of people and never spend a day in jail. They can become millionaires. Just about any U.S. President could be used as an example. Ditto for CEO's, like Bill Gates. The same applies to the media and contemporary labor unions. So one can be variously punished or rewarded for bad deeds. In general, I think it's safe to say that those who profit from crime tend to be more powerful and are generally associated with "organized crime," which can include governments. Good deeds are probably more likely to pay dividends, even if they aren't monetary. However, they can be punished - especially in the political arena. For example, activists who fight for social justice are typically insulted, harassed and even murdered. On a bit of a tangent, I find it interesting that evil seems to ordinarily prevail over good, at least at the higher levels of the political system. Think about the Roman Empire, the European colonial empires and the United States. There are amazingly few stories about "good leaders." One of the political/psychological questions I've long pursued is why it's so hard for good to triumph over evil. Ironically, one of the problems may be the victims, who are often too "good" to fight back. 

Moral values are learnt and unique to each individual therefore they can never be objective but a person's moral values can be determined objectively if we know all the factors which result in moral values. 

Is it possible that consciousness arose because of the conflict between 'self interest' and 'pack interest'? Does the 'level of consciousness' depend on the 'size of the pack'? Humans are social creatures. That's just a nice way of saying that we're pack animals. But packs don't work if each individual only looks after his own best interest. This is why we evolved emotions such as guilt and pride. 

We can also look at your question from both a philosophical and practical perspective. Do you want to educate people because you think it will somehow improve the quality of their lives? Or do you believe in knowledge for the sake of knowledge? There are obviously practical advantages to knowledge. Inventions like electricity are damn handy, and it's comforting knowing that Medieval superstitions (like burning cats and witches) are no longer in vogue. But even if you can't convince others to believe some of the things you've learned, the simple pursuit of knowledge and truth can be a fulfilling quest for some people. It all stems from curiosity, which is one of the most important aspects of our consciousness. 

Soft determinism. The universe is not deterministic, but human behaviour is. Quantum fluctuations are not predetermined in any way, so there is no fixed future. But human behaviour is completely determined by factors over which we have no control. 

Simply put, no. There is no physical law which prevents us from going back or forward in time. We just don't know how, yet. Simply stating that we can't is an opinion. A very popular opinion, but an opinion none the less. If we can go back in time, then something creating itself is plausible. So the answer is no. 

I've seen good answers up voted and brilliant answers down voted. I understand that not everybody has the same intellectual ability. And, we do not know, what we do not know. Good answers are comprehended by average intellects, while brilliant answers are often not. So how do I tell if an answer is too complicated for me to understand or just wrong? 

One way to look at it is to take into account what you (or another person) are measuring yourself against - other people or the universe. When I embraced political activism, I began doing my homework with a passion and probably knew more about politics than 95% of my colleagues and neighbors within a couple months. How can one not feel somehow arrogant or superior? It makes me appreciate the ancient Greek philosophers, who, from what I've read, weren't terribly humble. On the other hand, the more you learn, the more you realize how much more there is to learn. Carl Sagan probably felt that he was smarter than about 99.9% of the people on the planet (because he was), yet he spoke of astronomy as a deeply humbling discipline. I think people who study philosophy or engage in political activism have to make an ongoing effort to keep their feet on the ground. I would suggest that a narcissist is a person who adores themself for something they never worked for; their physical appearance, for example. People who admire themselves for the talents they've developed through hard work - be it athletics, the arts or intellectual pursuits - strike me as less narcissistic...though there's always a risk of self-admiration getting out of control. I would further suggest that there's a big difference between people who think they're absolute gods or goddesses versus those who are impressed with certain abilities but at the same time are keenly aware of their deficiencies. Is a person who wishes they had another shot at life so they could avoid some of the mistakes they made a narcissist? 

You are thinking of some mechanism that plays video images from outside the eyes and this is incorrect. The brain in the jar has no eyes. The information is fed into the optic nerve as electrical impulses. Have you ever played Call of duty? You can go anywhere in the game and the graphics are incredible. Imagine what virtual places will look like in another thousand years! Images don't have to exist, they can be created by expectations of what you think you should see. Remember that all expectations are built on memories. Eg, pictures of the places you intend to visit. Well even those memories could be implanted. 

As much as I hate Donald Trump, I was elated when he compared George Washington to Robert E. Lee. How would the corporate media respond? 

(It's Official: Fish Feel Pain) Are you aware of any philosophers who have applied this rationale to people? Many people have very poor reasoning skills, and there may also be a technological/cultural gap. For example, no one could have expected Native Americans or Australian Aborigines to understand the people who invaded their lands. Of course, we don't expect children to have strong or mature reasoning skills. In summary, humans are generally treated as different than other animals because we are supposedly alone in having consciousness and/or reasoning skills. Yet not all people have good reasoning skills. It's hard to put this into a question form, so let's go with this: What are some major philosophers or philosophical doctrines that treat humans and other animals similarly? Buddhism is an obvious example, but I'm particularly interested in knowing about notable Western philosophers who have come to similar conclusions. 

There seems to be much confusion around this topic. Our eyes detect light, but do they see? Detecting light is part of the visual process. The end result is that objects become visible. This occurs in the brains visual centres. No perception occurs in the actual eye itself. Your thoughts? 

To see, means to consciously perceive, unlike detect, which is a mechanical process, which requires no consciousness. A infrared camera can detect light, but it sees nothing. We, humans, see a representation of reality. As answered by my question, "Do we really see objects?", we perceive our brains representation of objects, not the objects themselves. But what of light? Do we see actual electromagnetic radiation, or do we perceive brightness, because of light?
