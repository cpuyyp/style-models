If you'd like the switch to be performing inter-VLAN routing then why are you still running an 802.1q trunk back to the router? You need an L3 link between the router and the switch, the default route on the switch to the router via that gateway and then return routes on the router pointing back to the switch's L3 interface. 

If possible I'd tie the power cables to the bottom of the arm and the network cables to the top. Even an inch of separation would be positive. As mentioned above the lengths involved probably won't lead to many issues, but it could exacerbate issues with very long runs (i.e. through an IDF / MDF to centralized switches) or if there's interest in 10GE, which is notoriously fickle even with STP. 

We thought it was the windows advanced firewall, but it is turned completely off on the server. Then we thought it was our Sonicwall rules, but they are almost exactly the same as the existing one we use. We cannot find any place that is blocking port 25. The new NAT rule also has ZERO traffic statistics, so it doesn't look like anything is even getting off of the new server to use the NAT rule. We have tried IISRESET and stopping and starting the SMTP server multiple times. The test always fails with the error 10061. My Google fu has gotten me nowhere. Is it possible that Windows Server 2012 R2 could still be blocking outgoing traffic on port 25, even though the firewall is turned off? What are we missing? 

I'm assuming, possibly incorrectly that your users are sitting in from of the windows boxes and need access to some linux gui applications. VNC works very nicely. Most Linux distributions have a the server sides vnc x-server included these days. Get a compatible windows vnc client and you should be good. If you need some additional security look for the ssl-enabled vnc stacks that are starting to crop up. Getting a windows side xserver like the one in cygwin will also works but is more complicated and will be much harder to explain to windows users. If your users are already linux savy this won't be to bad, otherwise go with vnc. 

It's likely that the default timeout is too long and that apps are breaking as a result. Keep in mind that the resolver will go start with the first entry in /etc/resolv.conf -every- time it's called (notwithstanding cached entries). Try adding something like "options timeout:.5" or similar (see the man page - $URL$ to let the local resolver try alternate name servers sooner. Be careful of making this value too low, as some recursive lookups can legitimately take quite a while. 

The reason your seeing php as having been built without sqlite is so fedora can split the php package and thus not force a big string of dependencies on people who don't want them. For instance you need sqlite and thus likely you do not need postgresql. If fedora was to build the main mod_php application with all --with's turned on you would end up installing postgresql without needing or wanting it. This helps people concerned with both security (only install exactly the software needed) and people concerned with package download bandwidth. 

If you're configuring router on a stick then why do you have L3 interfaces defined on the switch? If you're just looking for the 2950 to provide L2, then the configurations would properly look something like: 

Eliminate the home router: Confirm that the router configuration isn't doing some kind of blocking (to potentially include app recognition mechanisms looking for non-standard ports, etc). If this is inconclusive then you can try either connecting the user's computer directly to the Internet connection or an alternate (and known-working) firewall. If it's still not working on the direct connection then it makes sense to break out the sniffer. Install Wireshark and capture all traffic while attempting to initiate a connection. Confirm that the packet is as expected, look for the TCP handshake and, more importantly, look for any kind of ICMP unreachable messages coming back (port administratively prohibited, etc). If you're seeing ICMP coming back note whether it's coming from somewhere within the carrier or from the far end (i.e. the corporate edge router or firewall). It also may be helpful to set up another sniffer at the corporate side to confirm whether packets are making it at all. If, for example, you're seeing TCP SYN packets coming in but nothing going back then you'd want to figure out why. If you're seeing SYN come in from the user's side and ACK go back but that ACK doesn't show up at the user's side then that indicates something else may be blocked (..this is unlikely). 

Be sure to try generating lots of different types of failed login attempts. Try from X (gdm or kdm or xdm), try from the console, try from ssh, try from sudo and try from su. Different subsystems can (and will) be configured different ways. It's not uncommon for ssh to be configured to use an internal login command that cuts around the /var/log/btmp business. Try the command as well. You might look in /var/log/secure to see if your failed login attempts are being stored there. But, I'm afraid I don't know the structure of the Debian log directory. Try on anything in the /var/log directory. It's quite likely that ssh is logging something someplace. 

If you are trying to deny access to your website to anyone but your VPN users, you could lock down your entire network from the outside world and only allow the VPN connection. Once your users connect to the VPN, they could access any internal websites you have running by either accessing them by IP address or url and validate their referring IP address either in code or by way of IIS to allow or disallow further access. 

It shouldn't be different. As an example from one of my routers (redacted, obviously): Jun 19 16:39:56.440: %IPV6_ACL-6-ACCESSLOGP: list tu0-internet-in/190 denied udp 2001:x:x:x::2(123) (Tunnel0) -> 2001:x:x:x:x:x:x:x(123), 2 packets Jun 19 16:41:04.636: %SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGP: list internet-in denied tcp x.y.z.q(443) (GigabitEthernet0/3 beef.1aa1.beef) -> a.b.c.d(xxxxx), 1 packet Do you have a terminating line on your ipv6 ACL with an explicit deny w/log-input, like: ipv6 access-list tu0-internet-in ... sequence xxx deny ipv6 any any log-input Adding a sample of the ACL's in question for purposes of comparison would help, but I suspect it may just be the explicit deny that should fix things. 

About serving static files. Yes, you can use a lighter web server to do this. But, before you go to the effort be sure that it will do you any good. Is apache really using resources you need elsewhere? Maybe just configure apache to not start quite so many child processes. Be sure the added complication will pay for itself, because down the road it will almost assuredly confuse somebody when they try to figure out how everything is working. 

Both are actually desktop form factors. The pizza box happens to be ~1U in height, but is -not- the same form factor as a a modern 1U server. The lunchbox is, as mentioned above, akin to the shape of a child's metal lunchbox (but does not share its dimensions). These are the classic examples of both form factors - Pizza Box Lunch Box 

This is most likely a firmware bug, but the only situation I've heard of that -sources- packets from 0.0.0.0 is RARP (reverse ARP) which sends out requests from an all zero MAC to find its IP address. This used to be a component of diskless boot once upon a time but hasn't been seen in quite a while. It may be that the pinging station still held the ILO's MAC address in cache - and, of course, the intermediary switch. If the ILO had lost its address it could have been going through a RARP / BOOTP process. Or it just lost its mind.
