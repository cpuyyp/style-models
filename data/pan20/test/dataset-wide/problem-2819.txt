And it wouldn't stop there. This process actually can be carried out ad infinitum. And are precursors of vector spaces and related structures of modern linear algebra. 

Probably the most important incommensurability in the history of science was none other than the discovery of incommensurability of course! Sometime around the 5th century BC a Pythagorean (conjectured to be Hippasus) discovered and logically proved that some numbers like √2 can't be expressed as a ratio of whole numbers. This brought Pythagorean mathematics, founded on the basic assumption that all of mathematics and everything in the universe can be reduced to whole numbers and their ratios, to a screeching halt. Greek mathematics at this stage underwent a complete philosophical reboot, and geometry supplanted number as providing the foundations of the rest of mathematics. Had the doctrine of number not failed, we'd probably refer to Pythagorean Number Theory and the Pythagorean Method like we do to the geometry of Euclid and the axiomatic-deductive method as the beginning of the history of formal mathematics. 

The thing about 'why' questions is that they presume an answer exists, whether or not an answer actually exists. Suppose I answered your question with "You should behave morally because such-and-such reason." That reason would then be an incentive to act morally. But we're operating under the premise that no such incentives exist. Contradiction. I also object that the very idea of actions without consequences might not even be coherent. An action is something done so as to accomplish a purpose. They are by definition characterized by the intentionality of agents. If there are no consequences, then by the same token there are no actions either. 

Here Nietzsche describes his feeling about idols - most are not real (idols illustrate or claim a particular reality, but they cannot all be correct. In their number they provide too many different, contradicting claims). 

Daniel Dennett has nicely provided answers to the question of determinism. He claims that determinism and inderterminism are not incompatible. Fundamentally, we cannot definitively answer the question, nor does it make a difference if things are determined or not. Either way, we are morally obligated. Nevertheless, your logic for a deterministic universe is problematic. You say that a copy has the same rules as what it is copied from, therefore because the rules do not change the universe is determined. I don't see the logic? Football has the same rules copied from one game to the next, but each game is different and prior to the end, the outcome is unknown. The same rules mean that the constraints are the same, but it doesn't delineate all the opportunities or determine how the rules are used. Is a mathematical function for social relations obtainable? The very probability that math is correct hinges on the fact that some things are impossible to prove (Gödel's incompletness theorem), thus an all knowing mathematical genius would be unable to predict the future with math. If she knew everything about math (the ability to prove it all), math would be a contradiction and not useful for prediction. If she didn't know everything in math (couldn't prove it all) she would also not be all knowing, and would again be unable to predict the future. There cannot be a being with predictive mathematical determinism. A paradox like you posed points out that such a being cannot exist (for other examples of paradoxes that illustrate that something is false see the village barber paradox). 

[1]   I first found out about the utility monster a few months ago, and pondered on it for a while, before filing it away. Today, I formalised a system for reasoning about utility that would not only defeat the utility monster, but make utilitarianism more egalitarian. I shall state my system, and then explain each of the points in more detail below.   Dragon’s System: > 1. All individuals have the same utility system. 2. $U: -1 <= U <= 1$. 3. The sum of the utility of an event and its negation is $0$. 4. Specifically, the sum total of all positive utilities an individual can derive (for unique events without double counting) is $1$. 5. Specifically, the sum total of all negative utilities an individual can derive (for unique events without double counting) is $-1$. 6. At any given time, the sum total of an individual's potential utility space is $0$. 7. To increase the utility of an event, you have to decrease the utility of its negation. 8. To decrease the utility of an event you have to increase the utility of its negation. 9. An event and its negation cannot have the same utility unless both are $0$. 10. If two events are independent then the utility of both events occurring is the sum of their individual utilities. Explanation: 

A world without randomness presupposes many things and is impossible to assess, but assuming that the only thing that has changed is our knowledge that the world is not random we can then try to evaluate free will. So, what is free will? For the sake of argument, we can call it the ability of agents to make unimpeded choices. Obviously all choices are impeded to some extent by our experience, but we want to know whether randomness is what allows our choices. This is where the premise is obviously silly. Randomness has no logical connection to choice. Just because I make a calculated decision, one that is not random, would not inherently mean I did not make the decision. How can I make a particular choice, if my choice is random. Agency, is far more deep and controversial than a debate between randomness and determinism. For instance, what determines our actions are often well illustrated as not random, in fact in social science and psychology we often see the causation behind action, but that does not necessarily take away agency. For example, I may choose one job over another because of very concrete, non-random reasons like salary (a value shown by society), but that does not inherently mean I didn't make the choice unimpeded. If I randomly decided which job, I would not illustrate free will, all that happened was chance. Second, even if my choices are caused by non-random circumstance, that does not mean that circumstances do not create agency. Physical reactions may create a quality of agency as defined above that then follows non-random behaviors. Finally, we live in a world with more or less free will. For instance, a trafficked prostitute has more agency than a prostitute that is not trafficked (much of this is determined by the discourse of how states define women and prostitution). In the most meaningful way, one person can have less impeded choices than others, which illustrates, regardless of randomness or determinism, free will.
