The simple answer, unfortunately, is yes. In fact, it is a resounding "yes". Option "A" uses a large "bag" to enclose the asteroid, and then to tow it to lunar orbit (or another feasible location). There's a problem, though, which is that simply surrounding an asteroid with a cylinder won't capture it. You have to "tighten" the "bag". This is implied in a graphic here and is explained in an article in Popular Mechanics ("How to Mine an Asteroid", Aug. 2012), and shown in a video on NASA's website. Basically, a series of "arms" constrict the "bag" to form-fit the bag to the asteroid's surface. The procedure could create many indentations on the asteroid's surface, and, as you said, destroy some of the most valuable information. The footprints of the astronauts who walked on the moon will stay there for many years; any indentations on an asteroid will be impossible to fix. However, this entire idea is far from finished. NASA will not even decide between options "A" and "B" until "late 2014". So we won't know the precise details for a while. So why go ahead with the whole thing if we're going to lose some of the best information we could get? Well, the Initiative isn't motivated purely by surface features. Part of it is spurred on by plans to pioneer new technologies needed to get humans to Mars. Other tangential benefits include diverting an asteroid that could be headed for Earth (although the asteroid candidates for this mission are much smaller than any of their more dangerous cousins; also, the Asteroid Initiative is under "Asteroid and Comet Watch" on NASA's website - right near plans to blow up a dangerous asteroid!), or even mining an asteroid for metals or resources for astronauts (such as water). Also, this mission isn't the only way to study an asteroid (although it might be the best). We could always send a lander to an asteroid - after all, we can land on a comet (erm, well, we're trying - I'm rooting for Rosetta and Philae!), which would make it simple to collect samples before heading home . . . although the distance to travel would be a lot longer than just to lunar orbit. All of this comes together to mean that NASA won't worry itself over losing data on the surface of the asteroid. Would that information be nice? Oh, yes. But given the other good things coming out of the mission, the pros here outweigh the cons. It's simply one of the trade-offs that might have to be made for this mission. 

Equal mass Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to us, is composed of a binary star and Proxima Centauri (making it a triple star system). Alpha Centauri A has a mass of 1.1 M$_{\odot}$, while Alpha Centauri B has a mass of 0.9 M$_{\odot}$. If you count brown dwarfs, Luhman 16 are a good target, with each being about 0.04 M$_{\odot}$. Unequal mass Eta Carinae contains a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) with a mass of 120-160 M$_{\odot}$ and a smaller (but still very massive) star with a mass of 30-60 M$_{\odot}$. Sirius is okay, though with two stars of much smaller masses, 2 M$_{\odot}$ and 1 M$_{\odot}$. Double binary Mizar, in reality part of a six-star system (Mizar/Alcor), has four stars separated into two pairs. This ensemble then interacts with the binary star Alcor. 

During a sunset, the Sun is lower in the sky than during most of the day - much lower. Therefore, light from the Sun travels through about 120 miles of dense atmosphere, compared to the roughly 2 miles it travels through from straight up. Here's a rough sketch (not to scale) to demonstrate this. It is clear that $B>A$: 

The effective sunspot number $R_{\text{eff}}$ is calculated through a mix of observations and model calculations. It focuses primarily on some parameter called the frequency of the ionosphere F2 layer, denoted $\text{foF2}$, the highest frequency of electromagnetic radiation which can be reflected off the F2 layer; it can be observed as well as computed based on a certain model (real-time observational data from stations around the world is available here). More information on $\text{foF2}$ can be found on this page. The mean-squared error between the observational value $\text{foF2}_{\text{obs}}$ and the calculated value $\text{foF2}_{\text{calc}}$ over observations by $n$ stations is $$\Delta=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\text{foF2}_{\text{obs},i}-\text{foF2}_{\text{calc},i}\right)^2$$ where $_i$ denotes the value at station $i$. $R_\text{eff}$ is defined to be that chosen sunspot number such that $\Delta$ is minimized. This is just an application of a least squares method to fit a model framework to match observations. An example of this using the Simplified Ionospheric Regional Model (SIRM) is Zolesi et al. (2004), although the procedure for calculating $R_\text{eff}$ was first proposed by Houminer et al. (1993). This was introduced to augment or replace something called the 12-month smoothed sunspot number, $R_{12}$, which is entirely based on observations. Zolesi et al. write 

There is neither regularity nor periodicity in the data, meaning that your proposed explanation is not possible. Looking at the dips in more detail (see the rest of the paper) confirms the conclusion. 

Yes, they are created through stellar nucleosynthesis. Sulfur is created from silicon via an alpha process, with the reaction $$_{14}^{28}\text{Si }+\text{ } _2^4\text{He}\to _{16}^{32}\text{S }+\gamma$$ Oxygen burning can also create $_{16}^{31}\text{S}$, as well as other elements like $_{15}^{31}\text{P}$. Additionally, both oxygen and phosphorus can be formed through supernova nucleosynthesis (see Koo et al. (2013)). The CNO cycle won't produce sulfur or phosphorus. The chain simply isn't set up to create either of them directly. 

I'm not a professional astronomer, but I still think I may be able to help. In response to your comment to WayfaringStranger's answer 

Wikipedia has some handy-dandy discoveries. I don't know if they're "revolutionary" per se, but they're pretty interesting. 

The odds of a supernova being visible to the naked eye is slim. Adams et al. (2013) estimated that there is a 20% chance that we will be able to see such a supernova within the next 50 years. That should give you an idea of how unlikely this is. The vast majority of supernovae that have been discovered lately have magnitudes ranging from +20 to +16 (check out this page, updated daily). The naked eye can see objects of magnitude +6 or less, meaning that a supernova of magnitude 16 is $10^{10}$ times fainter. Powerful telescopes are needed to observe these events. Supernovae also aren't that quick. They fade over days or weeks or months or even years. You would not see a bright, quick flash of light. I don't want to say that it's impossible . . . but it's impossible. If this was a supernova, it's even more unlikely that you could have seen such detail. When I say that a supernova is visible to the naked eye, that just means that you can see the light from it. It doesn't mean that the structure of any gas or dust being expelled can be observed. To make out that level of detail, it would need to be quite close to Earth - and so it would definitely have been observed by astronomers and amateur stargazers in quite a few places. So no, I don't think this was a supernova. I have no idea what you saw, but it was not what you think it is. 

Why do short a period? Well, the comet will only be in the area for a short time: NASA estimates the worst part will last roughly 20 minutes. After that, the danger will have subsided. Any particles that could damage the spacecraft will be long gone. 

Here's the math: $$\frac{1 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ year}} \times \frac{1 \text{ m}}{100 \text{ cm}} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \text{ m}} \times 5,400,000,000 \text{ years}=54,000 \text{ km}$$ That's about one-seventh the current distance to the Moon - at its closest pass. 

Wikipedia claims that Saturn's rings may be as old as Saturn itself; NASA says that they could be only a few hundred million years old. The 4.something-billion-years-old fits in with one of the two theories of the rings' formation - that Saturn swept up material from the protoplanetary disk. The date makes sense, because there's no way the disk would last for billions of years. The newer date does fit in with the moon-torn-apart hypothesis, which is perhaps the dominant hypothesis. The hypothetical progenitor moon could have been torn apart at any point between Saturn's birth and the present day. "A few hundred million years ago" fits in reasonably well. I should add that all the theories surrounding the rings' formation have reasonable evidence in their favor, though there's quite a lot for the 4.something-billion-years theory (see here, here and here). Thank you, Cassini! 

Sort of. But not the same system. Here's a photo of the directions the two Voyager probes (and a couple Pioneers) are traveling: 

The short answer here is no. In fact, when compared to our solar system, nothing about the radiation Alpha Centauri Bb gets is normal. It is situated extremely close to Alpha Centauri B - 0.04 AU. Given that both Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B are similar to the Sun, I think it's clear that this exoplanet will not receive a "normal" (normal here meaning similar to Earth) amount of radiation from Alpha Centauri B. Conversely, Alpha Centauri Bb is 11 AU away from Alpha Centauri A - much greater than the distance between it and Alpha Centauri B (a bit more than the distance between Saturn and the Sun). This means that the planet will receive only a tiny fraction of light from Alpha Centauri A relative to Alpha Centauri B. 

Void formation is due to baryon acoustic oscillations. These can be thought of as fluctuations in the dense matter in the early stages of the universe; they became anisotropies, which can be seen in the cosmic microwave background. The fluctuations grew, until they hit the 150 Mpc scale, which correlates nicely to the sizes of voids in the universe today. There's an interesting section (4.2) in this paper by Robert Brandenberger, which gives a mathematical treatment of how fluctuations of all kinds grew in the early universe. There is a better version of the explanation in Zeldovich (1972), which in fact puts forth the theory. The number density (if you'll pardon the pun) is lesser in that latter, but the former has a good overview, as it is meant to be a broad summary. The simple explanation is that tiny fluctuations grew over time to become enormous structures. 

None of these things were named after chocolate. Milky Way The name comes from a Greek myth, at the end of which Hera - Zeus' wife - spills her breast milk. In places where the sky has not been affected by light pollution, the Milky Way looks like a milky-white streak. Hence the name. The chocolate of the same name was introduced in 1923. Apparently, it was not named after our home galaxy, but after a milk shake of a similar name. Galaxy The Greek word γαλαξίας (galaxias) is closely tied to the Milky Way (because, for a long, long time, other galaxies were considered nebulae - "island universes"). It's English translation is "milky one" - a nod to the same Greek myth. The chocolate of the same name was introduced in 1960. Mars Mars was a Roman god, not a Greek one (his Greek equivalent is Ares, I think). The name dates back for millennia - indeed, the Greeks associated Ares with the planet. The chocolate of the same name was introduced in 1932. 

I don't know if this is what most astronomers use, but it is certainly a method that could be used. It also makes for some interesting photos. Gravitational lensing was one of the great predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity, and was actually one of the first pieces of evidence for it - see the solar eclipse of 1919. Gravitational lensing is the bending of light by a massive object. Because mass and energy warp space-time, we know that if you can calculate how much the light is bent, you can calculate the mass of the body bending it. Wikipedia gives the following formula: $$\theta=\frac{4GM}{rc^2}$$ where $M$ is mass, $r$ is the distance the object is from the light, and $G$ and $c$ are, of course, constants. So if you can measure how much light is bent by an object, you can calculate its mass. It's hard, and you would need good conditions for it to work, but it could work, nonetheless. 

The magnitude of the force of gravity between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses: $$F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$$ This doesn't change depending on which body you're applying the force to, i.e. if you interchange the masses. The magnitude is the same. What does change is the direction of the force. Force is a vector quantity, denoted as $\vec{F}$ or $\mathbf{F}$. If we write the equation for gravity using proper vector notation, we have $$\mathbf{F}=G\frac{m_1m_2}{|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r_2}|^2}\frac{\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2}}{|\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2}|}$$ Here, the positions of the objects are represented by vectors, $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r_2}$. Additionally, $|\mathbf{x}|$ denotes the norm of a vector $\mathbf{x}$ - its magnitude. Now, if you interchange the masses, the direction of the force changes, although $|\mathbf{r_1}-\mathbf{r_2}|=|\mathbf{r_2}-\mathbf{r_1}|$, because this refers to the magnitude of the vectors. So the force applied on one object is the opposite of the force applied on the other object. This is Newton's third law. The acceleration is more interesting. The force on object $1$ due to gravity is $$F_1=m_1g_1$$ Here, $$g_1=\frac{Gm_2}{r^2}$$ where $m_2$ is the other mass. This should tell you that $g_1\neq g_2$, except when $m_1=m_2$. I'm not an expert in general relativity, but I do know that it describes how spacetime curves due to the presence of one body. The solution to the Einstein Field Equations, the metric, is different for different bodies, because one piece of it, the stress-energy tensor, is different for objects of different mass/energy/etc.
