You probably need to adjust the 'top stop' screw on the rear mech, and also tighten the rear gear cable. The rear mech has two small screws. One of these adjusts how far up/inward the mech will move and the other screw adjusts how far down/outward it will move. They are used to prevent the chain dropping off the top and bottom of the cassette. Work out which one needs adjusted (trial and error should be ok) until the mech has the right range of movement to go from the biggest sprocket to the smallest sprocket (but no more). Also, you might need to adjust the cable tension, esp if the mech is not moving from the smallest sprocket when you push the shifter. You can do this normally by simply adjusting the screw mechanism where the cable attaches to the rear mech, and screwing it outward, so as to tighten the cable. Again trial and error with this should work. Putting the bike on a work stand where the rear wheel is suspended off the floor, and you can spin the pedals and wheels while shifting the gears makes this job much easier. Dont be scared to experiment a bit to figure out how things work. 

I had a Trek which broke entirely through in the same place. Turned out it was still ridable, and I managed to carefully ride it the 6 miles home. The frame was several years old, had seen some heavy use, and the frame, forks and handlebars were pretty much the only original parts. I took it back to my local Trek dealer, and after a bit of debate they contacted the Trek rep and they agreed to replace the entire bike! Good work Trek. Anyway, I'd certainly take your frame back. They should replace the frame and rebuild the bike for you. I doubt they will provide something for you to ride in the mean time though. 

I think you're the only one who can determine if they'll be an advantage to you. In general, I'd think the extra position would be an advantage. Even with 4 positions on your standard drop bars, being able to take weight off your hands and put it on your elbows might be a welcome relief, even if it's just for a short period of time. 

Can you? Sure! Should you? Well... You say it's a mountain bike - what kind of riding do you do? If you're mostly doing commuting on smooth roads, you should be able to get away with it through careful riding, avoiding curbs, pot-holes and other harsh knocks. If you're riding off-road on even moderately bumpy terrain, I'd say that's a prescription for a wheel failure which will end up in another accident, and this time it may not be just the wheel that ends up broken. As far as spoke wrenches go, when I last really worked on a wheel, the top of the nipple had a small slot in it where you could use a slotted screwdriver. It appears that they still do: $URL$ $URL$ stolen from Bike Parts Place.com You can remove the tire, tube and rim tape then use your screwdriver in this slot. I'd suggest that when you order your spokes you would want to order either a multi-size spoke wrench or a set of single-size wrenches (I just picked up a Parke Tools multi-size one last night for $10, the set was about $15) as that will make quick tweaks to truing much easier in the future. I'd also suggest ordering a few extra spokes, just to have them on hand should this ever happen to you again. Since it's your rear wheel and that takes the majority of your weight, I'd suggest that you'd want to temporarily replace both of them with spokes from the front. Where from the front you'd want to pull them, I'm not certain - I'd hope someone else will chime in on that. Pulling them from right next to each other increases the weakness at that spot, but makes it easier to maintain true, while pulling from 180Â° from each other spreads the weakness, but makes it more difficult to true up. As a side note, I'm curious where you are that you've got a bike with 29" wheels - I certainly don't know all there is to know about bikes, but that's a diameter I've not heard of before. 

After finishing my last two rides on my second hand bought bike, I've noticed both stanchions appear as if they are leaking oil Could it be just WD residues or excess suspension oil? 

First time taking the cranks off. The bolts, chinrings and drive side came out easy. Left is stuck. Should I open, pull or do something particular for it to come out? 

I have noticed a lot of scraping on the inside of my Trushift 44T plate. Is it just a function of distance, time and color or is it a clue that something is not working properly? The bike was bought used. Here is my chainring (bottom) and another from my buddy's bike. Mine did more km so it is not a perfect comparison but still: 

I have a shimano XT hydraulic disc brake system. While servicing it I took out the pads an checked the pistons in the caliper and noticed that only one is extracting. After a few pulls on the lever when the one piston reached the end of its travel, the brake fluid spurted from it. I've since resettled and reset the pistons but I'm thinking I might still have fluid leaking out from there in the future. Or maybe that was normal behavior? 

It fell from the front hub/disc brake/fork area (most likely brake caliper) on my friend's bike which I'm servicing for the first time and I have no idea what they are! 

I have ridden roads like this, but only in large herds groups (30+ people) where we were able to draft and maintain 30+MPH in 55+MPH traffic. Also, there was a generally agreed upon "they'll have to get us all" mentality that if anyone was hit, the rest would ensure aggressive legal persecution prosecution would ensue. This ride was in the Gainsville, FL area back in the late 80's. It was very nerve-wracking for the first few miles, then it got more comfortable. We were always very conscious of the traffic, and had constant communication through the group of traffic approaching from behind. As I recall, we also had a bit more shoulder. Riding solo, I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole! 

I have used one like this for many years: $URL$ $URL$ Amazon It's not ideal, and it doesn't hold the bike very far off the ground, but it's cheap, it gets the rear wheel up, the legs are wide enough to be stable, and though there's some flex, it's strong enough for some grunting to loosen a tight bolt. With careful balance, you can tip the bike & stand back to get the front wheel off the ground, too, but it's not ideal for that. This one (also via Amazon) has some adjustability, but it doesn't look like the legs are quite as wide, so I'm not sure if it would be as stable. No particular endorsement of Amazon for said purchase, they were just the first place I found an image of the product I was looking for. 

now some photos. it is very hard to create a stable reference angle with the phone and without a tripod but you will get the idea. This is the chain on the first (small) chainring when the bolt is tighten: 

So I'm working with the park tool tutorial but I've done it a couple of times in the past. When adjusting my Shimano Deore Front derailleur (height and rotation) it lines up great but when I tighten the mounting bolt the whole thing "banks" inwards and so the cage bottom rises and touches the chain. 

How to i set the height and tighten the mechanism with affecting the other rotation "axis" of the derailleur? are there always combination of cogs (front and back) that will cause the chain to run against the cage?. 

Dealing with chain skipping (but mostly on the smaller chainrings, truth be told) I've wondered how these affect the riding and how many problems and what kind should i expect from these two broken teeth on the big plate, and close together as well: 

And this is the chain still on the first (small) chainring but now the bolt is almost fully loose, so in fact, nothing changed with the actual position of the mount: 

This is the back of a Deore M-535 caliper, where the pin is marked at the places it should have been secured, 

It depends on the frame material what effect the water inside the frame will have. A lot of frames have a small hole drilled at the bottom of the bottom bracket casing. If there is no hole there you can drill one yourself. I have done this on aluminium frames before and it is very easy. Use a 4mm drill bit and drill through till you cut into the bottom bracket void. There will be a gap internally between the frame casing and the actual bottom bracket. A hole this small in the centre of the bottom bracket casing will not affect the strength of the frame but will allow water to drain. I have found frames fill up with water even with the seat post in place if ridden in the wet, so putting a cork in the seat post hole probably won't make much difference. 

The difference is simply in the number of teeth on the chainring, and therefore the distance that the chain will travel when you turn the crank. With the standard crank you will be pushing the chain further, and therefore given the same cassette, the standard chainring will provide longer gearing than a compact, and require more power to turn. There are tables available which show the gear inches for different sizes of chainring and cassette. Interestingly a 50/11 will provide a longer gear than a 52/12, meaning that a 50 tooth chainring and 11 tooth rear sprocket will be 'faster' than a 52 tooth chainring with a 12 tooth rear sprocket. Importantly, you should consider what cassette goes best with the chainset you have chosen. A 34/30 gear is a very high ratio and is similar to what you would get from a triple crankset. If you chose the compact chainset then it might be more appropriate to use a the 11/28 cassette. Choosing a big widely spaced cassette like an 11/30 means the gears will be quite spaced out and you even if you have an 11spd cassette you might find there are times you cant get a gear which you can comfortably spin, or the change in cadence required to go from one gear to another is awkward. It will also mean you will need a longer cage rear mech, as the chain will need to be longer. 

The one piece seat-stay/chain-stay construction looks like a Hutch* from the early 80's however, having both the left & right side stays made from one bent tube doesn't match up exactly with anything I have looked at while browsing the BMX Museum. It might be something from the late 70s (they only have from 1980 on pictured there). Or it might be a knock-off cheap copy of the Hutch design. That might be a good place to continue your search. Based on the eBay prices of some of these bikes, I'd say you've likely got yourself a valuable project on your hands! *I picked Hutch based on one that was similar looking on eBay that came up in a search for "bicycle gt 4130 cro mo team". 

Frankly, it's going to be hard for random strangers on the internet to determine the extent of damage to carbon fiber from a picture. Be upfront with the seller - tell him you're uncomfortable and would like to have a bike shop take a look at it. Be prepared before hand - find a local, reputable shop, explain the situation and ask them if they'll do the inspection & how much they'd charge. Be willing to pay them $20, $30, $50 for their work. For the shop it is probably just a few minutes work to disassemble and inspect. If they determine it's cracked carbon, not just paint, you've saved yourself the purchase price and the potential of an expensive hospital bill. If they say it looks good, you're probably OK, and the few bucks for peace of mind is probably worth it. In any case, don't let the emotion of pursuing a good deal override your gut feeling about it. If you don't think it's safe, pass, no matter how good the deal is. After all, it's your body on the line should it fail on you. 

If you are able to hear it then google maps navigation will read out turn-by-turn directions to you. I found the noise of wind while riding prevented me from hearing these, but if you were riding slower, or used an ear piece this might work. The dedicated cycle GPS unit will provide the best solution, the question is whether you'd use the functionality enough to justify the expense, or can you get by with a phone. 

Will it work? Probably. The range of movement of the mech wont be an issue and the chain will run through it, so I cant see why it wouldnt work. This article is quite helpful: $URL$ Shimano will tell you 11spd components wont work with 10spd though. If I were you I'd just get a 10spd rear mech. 

You should be fine using a 105 cassette on the turbo wheel. There will be wear to the chain, cassette and chain rings, but provided the drive train is clean and lubricated then this should be minimal. Doing what you've suggested is a good solution. Try to make sure if you use the bike on the road then the drive train is reasonably clean before swapping onto the turbo wheel and if one cassette becomes more worn than the other then replace it, or you might then have problems and cause more wear on the chain.
