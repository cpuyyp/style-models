"Explosiveness" refers to the rate and efficiency of neuromuscular recruitment: how quickly, thoroughly, and intensely you can cause your muscles to contract. This is largely determined by your genes. Consider training for strength via heavy squats and deadlifts. Stronger muscles produce more force than weaker muscles, and therefore can produce greater bodily acceleration. Please note that strength training (coupled with proper recovery: food and sleep) probably will increase your muscular bodyweight, but this will not reduce your explosiveness, because muscle is obviously able to lift itself. 

Applying Hennemanâ€™s size principle, we can see that the body will not recruit fast-twitch muscle fibers to move small/light loads. Muscle fibers are trained only by recruiting them. So, you need (relatively) heavy weights to develop fast-twitch muscle fibers. In this respect, a single kettlebell of 16 kg will be of limited use. Isometric exercise will be of limited use, too, because it it difficult to quantify, and therefore unsuitable for progressive resistance training. 

You're very light for your height. You probably could simply double your daily intake for some weeks. In conjunction with barbell-based strength training, you would build muscle, fat, bone, etc., all of which you probably need. 

Depending on the trainee's ability to recover from the stress imparted by the barbell lifts, progress will be made on this simple program over a time period of weeks to months. This program cannot be used indefinitely, because of the law of diminishing returns. Strength can be built for decades, but more-complex programming and longer stress-recovery-adaptation (SRA) cycles become necessary. In particular, once the trainee can no longer complete an SRA cycle within 72 hours, that trainee is no longer a novice trainee, but is instead by definition an intermediate trainee: one who can increase strength over a time-range of four days to four weeks. Trainees who cannot increase strength that quickly have become advanced trainees; extremely few trainees ever reach this level of training advancement. Note that these definitions do not depend on actual strength levels. Intermediate -- and especially advanced -- training programs are extremely varied because they must be individualized to suit each trainee's particular needs and interests. For example, an intermediate trainee interested in competing in powerlifting needs a program that differs from the program needed by an intermediate trainee interested in marathoning. The Texas Method and Heavy-Light-Medium are templates for intermediate programs. Advanced trainees might use bespoke programs, but such programs, to be effective, must still exploit the GAS using (long) SRA cycles. 

Considering your goals to increase size, supersets are not as efficient in comparison to doing these exercises in isolation. During the execution of a superset, each previous set makes significant in-roads into your ability to perform the next set in sequence as optimally as without. Given all other things being equal, the increase in the cross-sectional size of a muscle is proportional to the increase in its ability to resist more weight. If you were to split the proposed superset exercises across multiple days, your ability to lift more weight on all the exercises would increase significantly, allowing for greater levels of hypertrophy. 

After popping your shoulder, your tendons will be relatively weaker through abnormal stretching and the more times this happens, the more likely it is that your shoulder will pop. Depending on the severity of the damage to your tendons, if surgery isn't required to shorten them, it's likely that strengthening your rotator cuffs will help fix the imbalance in strength affecting your outstretched arm. Face-pulls are one exercise that helps in fixing this although it really depends on which auxiliary muscles are affecting you. Good luck. 

The amount of weight that you are lifting puts you in the elite category and is demonstrative of the hard work you've done to achieve that, well done. A lesser-known fact is that the standard bench press puts tremendous strain on the connective tendons below the shoulder joint since the upper arm remains in a wide position with respect to your pecs. An alternative exercise to include in your routine is dumbbell bench presses. These allow you to finish the exercise in the more natural position with the arms much closer together, alleviating a lot of the pressure on that tendon, and allowing you to make the movement more productive from the middle to final position. The goal here is to allow maximum development of the pecs and avoid injury at the same time. 

Strength training certainly can make bones denser and also strengthen the ligaments, although the actual length of a bone is not changed. 

If you can't get to the gym, I suggest using some bodyweight exercises. For the lower body, pistol squats are a challenging exercise to provide the stimulus and time under tension to cause gains. To complete the legs, if you can support your heels and can grab a swiss exercise ball, this will allow you to a supported version of a leg curl - an advanced exercise and a challenge for the strongest of people. Handstand presses are another beast of an exercise. If you can do more than 5 then you are in a good place physically, again, a very challenging exercise for most. One arm pressups, with and without the other arm partially supporting between them provide enough progression to challenge your pecs and triceps. A variation on the pullups is to add a partial rep on each one at the top. To work the grip, one arm bar hangs will test your mettle. My current record is almost a minute. Good luck 

Please consider quitting seated leg presses and other machine-based movements. These can bias your exertion toward quad-dominance, which may exacerbate imbalances in forces in your knees. Instead, do low-bar back squats to proper depth (which is not maximum/"ass-to-grass" depth). Squats will strengthen both your posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes) and your quads in a way that minimizes the net anterior-posterior stress on your knees (and their cartilage). Consider these threads: 

Having someone watch your exercises, especially for any spinal flexion. Strengthening your back with properly-programmed and meticulously-executed low-bar back squats and deadlifts. 

It sounds like you've had an unpleasant experience with Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). DOMS occurs very commonly, especially following new activity involving eccentric muscle contractions -- in your case, controlled descents into squats. What you've described -- "having difficulty lower[ing] my body to sit in a chair or get into my car" -- is indeed extremely unpleasant, but is essentially harmless. As you've already discovered, DOMS usually dissipates within a few days. It will not be as bad after the next time you squat. Regarding your workout scheme: Please consider the Starting Strength novice program, which I've described in a related answer. Sets of 20 repetitions, after the first few occasions, do not provide the best type of stimulus to develop strength. 

I don't know, but in order to make progress (that is, gain strength), you must actually recover; your schedule must accommodate this. 

Please note that neither of these books devotes much attention to stretching. Similarly, neither of them discusses "functional training" much; they advocate strength training as the most functional training, because strength is the most-significant and most-trainable factor in physical function. 

I applaud your strength increases! But, I fail to see how kettlebell swings could reduce anterior pelvic tilt or shoulder-rounding. Actually, I can imagine how KB swings might exacerbate both of those postural tendencies. In general, posture is unconscious. One of the first steps to changing posture is developing awareness of posture. As you increase your awareness of your posture, you can change muscular engagement to reinforce the posture that you want. I have no recommendations for exercises to reduce APT. To help reduce shoulder-rounding, consider strengthening your back via deadlifts, chin-ups, and bent-over barbell rows. 

This program could be improved by using incrementally and progressively increasing load(s) instead of relatively-constant (body) weight loads. The lack of progressive overload in this program is its primary serious deficiency for strength-training purposes. Low-bar back squats. 

Most people have misconceptions what 'tone', what it is, and how to achieve it. Being toned is a combination of two things - having muscle mass, and having a low enough amount of body fat to show the definition between the aforementioned muscles. A six pack is simply satisfying these conditions in a specific area - the stomach. Lifting If you're 6'1 152, and without visible abs, I would presume you have limited muscle mass. I realize you don't want a bodybuilder look, but 1/2 of the formula for being "toned" is having muscle on your frame. You need to lift weights like you're trying to get big - just don't eat like you're trying to get big. You can lift like a bodybuilder or a powerlifter for years but without a certain caloric volume, you aren't going to get that big. Drop the machines and add in the big lifts - you need to be doing squats, deadlifts, presses, weighted pullups, etc. Also, these big exercises, when done properly, work your core very hard, which helps to build muscle necessary for a six pack. The prior advice that you should stop lifting so much if you start getting too big is just incorrect - keep lifting big, just don't eat as much. Diet Which brings us to the next half of the equation - diet. While on the surface what you posted doesn't look bad, the devil is in the details. You need to really know how many calories you're taking in, how much protein, etc. For a couple of weeks, track everything you ingest with something like FitDay, MyFitnessPal, etc. Get an idea for how many calories you're taking in, and how many you're burning. Only then can you really know if your diet is properly aligned with your goals. Ab exercises People tend to work under the assumption that in order to get a six pack, you need to do tons of ab work - crunches, lifts, planks, rollouts, you name it. Realistically, this isn't the case. Yes - as my definition at the top states, you need to have muscle mass to show stomach tone. However, most people that don't have a six pack simply have too much fat. Everyone's metabolism is different, and everyone's body accumulates fat differently. People like to throw out 'magic' numbers of body fat percentage where abs can be seen - these are general guidelines. Some people can have visible abs above 10%, some might need to get down to 7%. The real key is to just keep reducing fat until you get where you want to be - and remember, you cannot spot reduce fat. There is no exercise or diet that will cause you to lose more stomach fat than others. In the long run, you need to lose body fat to get the six pack you want. This requires a caloric deficit, but it also requires more focus on lifting to ensure that your body is burning fat, not muscle. In the short term, you may find it beneficial to focus more on building a baseline of muscle, without focusing as much on the caloric deficit. You will gain weight in this phase, but most of it should be muscle. Following some muscle gains, switch to a caloric deficit, cut the fat away, and you'll have the definition you want. 

There's no clear answer. You almost certainly will be able to grip a normal bar more easily (and therefore for more reps) than you can grip a 5-inch tree branch. You probably cannot finish the pull-up as completely on the tree branch (due to its relative thickness) as you can on a bar. That said, I applaud your pragmatism and motivation to make-do with what's available to you. 

For all but perhaps a few elite professional athletes, multiple heavy (intense) workouts per day are not good/useful, because they almost certainly cause more fatigue than that from which the body can recover within one day (or possibly multiple successive days). Note that insufficient recovery usually prohibits the desired adaptation (for example, increased strength), so exercising more (that is, incurring more fatigue) does not necessarily increase strength -- it actually may decrease strength. 

You've indicated that you have lost weight intentionally since beginning your training, and that you're eating at maintenance level now. This is incompatible with long-term strength acquisition. A powerlifting belt probably will help you in your lifts, but it cannot replace proper recovery factors (for example, sufficient protein and a caloric surplus). EDIT, to actually answer the question. ;-) Mehdi's advice -- "once it becomes harder to add weight every workout, start wearing a belt" -- is sensible. I started using a belt when I began to struggle (what seemed to me) quite a lot with my squat and deadlift. There is no reason to involve specific weight-per-exercise numbers in the decision-making process, unless for your own personal preferences. 

Please consider the Starting Strength Program, which aligns well with your goals of strengthening your posterior chain and maximizing training-time efficiency: 

Yes, deadlift improvements can contribute to squat improvements. Both of these barbell movements train the back and legs. However, please consider "The First Three Questions" whenever you see less progress than you want or expect. By the way: The squat cannot be spotted properly by a single person; two people are required -- one for each end of the barbell. And, if you fail a squat and the squatters help you, then stay with the bar; don't bail completely and leave it in their hands. 

Eat enough food (and get enough good sleep) to ensure that you gain two to five pounds of bodyweight per week. Don't get greedy with your weight increases. 

It's great to hear that you're enjoying resistance training. Instead of the exercises you listed, I recommend presses and bench presses. The Aasgaard Company's "Starting Strength" videos might help you start. Consider exercising thrice weekly (every 48-72 hours), alternating the press with the bench press on successive workouts, for three sets of five repetitions each ("3x5"). Once progress slows or you miss reps on successive sets, switch to five sets of three repetitions each ("5x3"). If you are female then consider switching as soon as the 3x5 gets "hard", before you start missing reps. On the first workout, work up from the empty bar (20 kg, or smaller, if necessary) to a weight that you can handle safely and with good form for the 3x5. Be sure to eat a caloric excess and especially lots of protein (1 gram per pound of total bodyweight, per day), and to get enough sleep/rest.
