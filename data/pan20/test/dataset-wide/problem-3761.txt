Moving quite a bit beyond the level of what is contained in Bourbaki's planches, one could ask for information about infinite-dimensional representations of Lie groups. Ideally we would include a complete description of the unitary dual, but since this is still an open problem, how about an explicit as possible description of the tempered dual and the Plancherel formula. 

As mentioned in the title, I would like to know a proof of the "well known" fact that the A6 preprojective algebra is of wild representation type. Ideally, I would like to see an explicit two-parameter family of indecomposable modules. If you happen to prefer type D to type A and want to give an answer there, that would be appreciated too. 

In Mukai's approach to this proof (in particular his Prop 4.49), care is needed typographically, all squaring must come before taking the trace. Note that having $\mathrm{tr}(\tilde{\rho}(h)) = 0$ for all h does not imply $\tilde\rho$ is trivial (eg 2 dim rep of SL_2), the condition we need is $\mathrm{tr}(\tilde{\rho}(h)^2) = 0$. I don't know how the 'similar' proof works either. Instead I'd approach it by saying WLOG k=ℂ (Lefschetz principle!). Then use Weyl's unitary trick to reduce the proof of linear reductivity to the case of representations of compact groups. If it's a proof of Mukai's Prop 4.49 you're after, again lets WLOG k=ℂ. By Weyl's unitary trick, for $h\in \frak h$ the expression$$ \int_{SU_n}\mathrm{Ad}(k)h^2dk$$ is $SU_n$-invariant, hence a scalar multiple of the Casimir. And we can see it's nonzero by taking it's trace on some nontrivial representation. 

The Nil-Hecke algebra is defined to be the subalgebra of the endomorphism ring of $\mathbb{C}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ generated by the operators of multiplication by $x_i$ and the divided difference operators $\partial_i$ which act by $f\mapsto \frac{f-s_if}{x_i-x_{i+1}}$ with $s_i$ being the simple reflection that swaps $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$. I know of two places where this appears. Firstly, in the construction of Schubert polynomials (and hence implicitly in the calculation of the (ordinary or torus equivariant) cohomology of the flag variety). And secondly, it is equal to the convolution algebra $H^{GL_n}_*(X\times X)$ where $X$ is the variety of complete flags in $\mathbb{C}^n$ and we are taking equivariant Borel-Moore homology. Due to the similarity of the objects appearing in each case, I feel as though this can't be a coincidence, but don't see for myself a direct relationship or know where this is written down. This may be because I've picked up both objects "on the fly" without a good understanding of the literature. Anyway the question is, what is the relation between these incarnations of the nil-Hecke algebra that I am telling myself should exist? 

The archimedean absolute values are independent, so as posed, this question should fail as soon as your number field has at least two archimedean places. Considering all places, both archimedean and finite, the only relation is that for x in K, the product of the v-adic absolute value of x taken over all places v is equal to one. Strong approximation will show that you can't expect any more non-trivial relationships between absolute values. 

Let G be a reductive algebraic group over a field k. Let S be a maximal split torus, Z its centraliser and N its normaliser. The Weyl group W is then defined to be the quotient N(k)/Z(k). Now we cannot hope for W to be realisable as a subgroup of G, but I would like to know how close we can get. There is a classical result of Tits in the case where G is split which says that for each simple reflection s in the Weyl group, we can find a lift ws in G with the property that these lifts satisfy the braid relations. They do not however square to the identity, instead square to an order 2 element of S, and we get an extension of W by an elementary abelian 2-group embedding in G. So my question ends up becoming, what generalisation of the above theorem of Tits exists when G is no longer assumed to be split? Ideally I'd get an answer for general reductive G, and if there happens to be a simpler formulation in the quasi-split case, I'd be interested in hearing that too. 

The map G(K) to (G/P)(K) is surjective over any field K. Here is a link to an explanation by Brian Conrad. $URL$ 

Allow me the excuse to mention a cute way of constructing Uq(sl2) as a q-analogue. Presumably this is ahistorical, since I suspect that initially Uq(sl2) was constructed first over the formal disc, then later it was realised that it was definable over $\mathbb{Q}(q)$. Anyhow, let S be a finite set. Consider a vector space with basis $\{[I]\mid I\subset S\}$. Define operators e,f,h on this vector space by $$e[I]=\sum_{i\notin I}[I\cup\{i\}]$$ $$f[I]=\sum_{i\in I}[I\setminus \{i\}]$$ $$h[I]=(2|I|-|S|)[I].$$ You can check that this is a representation of sl2 (it's just a tensor power of the standard represenation in disguise). Now q-analogise! How? Well we should replace the idea of a subset of a set with that of a subspace of a vector space (of course working over the finite field with q elements). Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$. We should consider the space of all complex-valued functions on the Grassmannian Gr(V) of all subspaces of V. Well actually we'd really like something of dimension 2^n, so we should consider only those functions invariant under the action of a Borel subgroup. Let F be the space of pairs (W,W') with $W\subset W'$ two subspaces of V satifying dim(W')=dim(W)+1. There are two obvious maps $p_1,p_2:F\to Gr(V)$. Now we can define two operators on our space of functions on Gr(V), namely $E=(p_2)_!(p_1)^!$ and $F=(p_1)_!(p_2)^!$. Here p! is pullback of functions and p! means sum the function over the fibre. These are almost the generators of the quantum group we're after, to make the formulae match up nicely, we need to modify the definition of p! by multiplying it by a factor of q-d/2 where d is the dimension of the fibre summed over (a Tate twist). Now you have two operators E and F, and when you compute their commutator, you naturally find another operator K such that $$EF-FE=\frac{K-K^{-1}}{q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2}}.$$ Computing KE=qEK and qKF=FK is now easy. But even better, this approach gives more than just the product structure on the quantum group. You can also get the coproduct. I will be brief since I haven't checked all powers that q that appear. I haven't thought about obtaining the antipode. Consider a short exact sequence of vector spaces 0-->V'-->V-->V''-->0. Given functions f' on Gr(V') and f'' on Gr(V''), one can define a function on Gr(V) by $$(f'\otimes f'')(X)=f'(X\cap V')f''(X/(X\cap V')).$$ There is a reasonable chance this needs correction by a power of q. The point however is that this defines an isomorphism between Borel-equivariant functions on Gr(V) and the tensor product of Borel-equivariant functions on Gr(V') with Borel-equivariant functions on Gr(V''). (If you drop Borel-equivariant, then you're still getting a map, you're just not deforming a representation of sl2). I leave it as an exercise to the interested reader to use this to deduce the coproduct formulae in Uq(sl2). 

(i) is true: A is equal to the stabiliser of X in the adjoint representation (otherwise this would be a smaller subgroup whose Lie algebra contains X). Also A is connected. Then X is central in Lie(A). Therefore it lies in the Lie algebra of the centre of A. By the generation hypothesis, A is equal to its centre, hence abelian. (ii) is also true: A representation of A on V is a map pi:A-->GL(V). Write Lie(pi) for the map between their Lie algebras. Then Lie(ker(pi))=ker(Lie(pi)). Since X is in ker(Lie(pi)), ker(pi) is a subgroup of A whose Lie algebra contains X. By the generation hypothesis, ker(pi)=A, hence A acts trivially on V. For question 3, to check whether a representation of a group scheme over an interesting base (e.g. t/W) is trivial, it suffices to check triviality at each closed point. Then it looks as though you're back in the case of a group over the complex numbers, where the action has just been shown to be trivial. 

If K and L are maximal subfields, then most of the time one would expect the map g to be injective, but not always. I will sketch how to construct examples of this form for which g is not injective. We will take D to be a cyclic division algebra of index greater than two. Explicitly, let E/F be a cyclic Galois extension of degree n, with Galois group generated by $\sigma$. Let $E[x]_{\sigma}$ be the twisted polynomial ring, with multiplication defined by $xa=(\sigma a)x$. Pick $t\in F^\times$ and let D be the quotient of $E[x]_{\sigma}$ by the central element xn-t. Let K be obvious copy of E in D, and let L be the conjugate of K by an element of the form $l_0+l_2x^2+\cdots+l_{n-1}x^{n-1}$ with all $l_i$ non-zero (yes, there is deliberately no linear term. This is the crux of the construction). I claim that this gives the desired counterexample. To show this, it suffices to tensor with E, and show that the product map from $(K\otimes E)\otimes(L\otimes E)$ to $D\otimes E=M_n(F)$ is not injective. K embeds via D into Mn(F) via $a\mapsto diag(a,\sigma a,\ldots,\sigma^{n-1}a)$ and hence $K\otimes E$ is the space of diagonal matrices. Pick the obvious basis k1,...,kn of this space, and let l1,...,ln be the conjugate basis of $L\otimes E$. Then (exercise), one can find indices i and j such that $k_il_j=0$. This yields the desired non-injectivity. 

Consider Aaron's suggestion (from his comment). If $p_1,p_2,\ldots$ are the primes in order, then for $n\geq p_1+p_2+\ldots +p_k+k$, then $f(n)\geq p_1p_2\ldots p_k$. Using standard analytic number theory estimates, the log of this lower bound of $f(n)$ grows like $O(k \log k)$, while $n$ grows like $O(k^2 log k)$. So there is a lower bound of $\log f(n)$ of the form $\sqrt{n}$ times some log factors, which shows that any upper bound like the one you have is off by at most a constant factor. Thinking about this some more, we see that the $+k$ in the bound for $n$ can be discarded in the asymptotics, so we are studying something which has the same asymptotics of Landau's function, for which asymptotics (for its logarithm) are known (and a formula for which is claimed on en.wikipedia). 

If by Leclerc, you mean his paper "Dual canonical bases, quantum shuffles and q-characters", then his Lemma 37 is not for a general convex order, but only for those that come from Lyndon words. And if you mean a different Leclerc paper, I'd like to know which you have in mind. I know two proofs of this fact. One relies on Proposition 1.9 in Lusztig's "Braid group action and Canonical Bases", together with standard facts about the T_i's, where standard means that you can read about them in Lusztig's book. From here, now that Lusztig has done the hard work for us, it is not hard (but may be a pain to typeset a proof). You might want to look at Beck and Nakajima's paper "Crystal Bases and two-sided cells of Quantum Affine algebras". In particular Section 2.6 is useful since it contains a restatement of Lusztig's result with all the relevant definitions on the same page, and then later on, (Prop 3.36) they prove an analogous upper triangularity result in the affine case under consideration. EDIT(20/12/12): Another proof of this fact is to consider the dual picture, where the uppertriangularity is equivalent to bar-invariance of the root vectors together with the Levendorskii-Soibelman formula. Originally here I claimed that the uppertriangularity of the bar involution is a Corollary of Theorem 3.1 of my own paper "Finite Dimensional Representations of Khovanov-Lauda-Rouquier Algebras I: Finite Type." Since the proof of said theorem invokes the Levendorskii-Soibelman formula, I cannot call this an independent proof. There is a discussion of this in arXiv:1210.6900. I would be happy to see a quiver variety proof, the only one I know of is Prop 7.9 in Lusztig's "Canonical Bases arising from Quantized Enveloping Algebras", where, as in Leclerc, not all convex orders are considered. 

Let B=TU be a Borus of G defined over Fq. Let H be the image of T(Fq) in G(Fq)/G(Fq)+. If H has index k, then the preimage of H in G(Fq) has index k. The preimage of H contains the large cell U-BU, which is dense in G. At least for a fixed type of G and q>>0, this immediately implies that k=1 (which of course implies the required abelianility). In general, a finer analysis of the formula for the number of points in a reductive group over a finite field should get finer control over for which q and G this argument works. Actually (Alternatively, using Bruhat and idea of looking at image of T(Fq) it suffices to show that every Weyl group element has a representative in the subgroup generated by unipotent elements. The Weyl group is generated by simple reflections, so this question is reduced to a computation in rank one, where it suffices to consider the simply connected groups SL2 and SU3. 

If I work over a field k,write D for the formal disk k[[t]] and Dx for the formal punctured disk k((t)), then there is an associated long exact sequence in algebraic K-theory ... Kn+1(Dx) --> Kn(k) --> Kn(D) --> Kn(Dx) ... I want to know, what happens if we replace the base k by a more general scheme? (I am particularly interested in the map K2(Dx) --> K1(k) (which must be the tame symbol right?)) 

Let μn be the group scheme of n-th roots of unity. If X is a scheme and L is a line bundle on X, then I can construct a μn-gerbe Y over X by letting the S-points of Y be a S-point of X, a line bundle M on S and an isomorphism between the n-th tensor power of M and the pullback of L to S. Can anyone provide examples not of this form? Commentary: It looks like I'm taking the image of an element of H1(X,Gm) in H2(X,μn) under the long exact sequence associated to 0-->μn-->Gm-->Gm-->0. Thus examples of gerbes for the multiplicative group Gm will likely be relevant, so people providing such examples will also be appreciated. 

Let X be an elliptic curve with the identity element O removed. Let U=X-P where P is a point of infinite order. Then U is affine by a Riemann-Roch argument. Now suppose that U=D(f). Then on the entire elliptic curve, the divisor of f must be supported at P and O only. This implies that P is a torsion point, a contradiction. 

This answer is being completely rewritten because it wasn't very comprehensible. We will show that there are more elements in the centraliser than the obvious ones mentioned in the question. At best, we will have an inelegant and impractical way to construct these extra elements. For most of this answer we'll just talk about the q=1 case, ie group algebras. We need some notation. Let W be the finite Weyl group and W' be the affine Weyl group. This is the semidirect product of W and the root lattice Q. k=ground field (char 0). The centraliser is the set of elements in the group algebra k[W'] invariant under the conjugation action of W. The general construction is: Given a vector space V with an action of W, then for any v ∈ V, the average $\sum_{w\in W} w.v$ is in the invariant space VW. So now in the affine Hecke algebra, fix an isomorphism between the finite Hecke algebra and the group algebra k[W] (In type E7 and E8 you'll need a square root of q in k). Then you can find elements in the centraliser using the above construction. The rest of this answer will show that at q=1, there are more elements in the centraliser than described by Bruce. We need more notation. Z(?)=centre(?). For λ in Q, we write eλ for the corresponding element in the group algebra k[W'] and wλ for the action of w on λ. We aim to show there are elements in the centraliser not in Z(k[W]) ⊗ Z(k[W']). Note that Z(k[W']) is spanned by $\sum_{w\in W}e^{w \lambda}$. Pick λ in a free W-orbit and u ∈ W. We apply our averaging construction to v=ueλ. So $y=\sum_{w\in W}wxw^{-1}e^{w\lambda}$ lies in the centraliser. If y is also in the tensor product, then we must have $y=z\sum_{w\in W}e^{w \lambda}$ for some $z\in Z(k[W])$. Let u vary over W and fix λ. We get |W| linearly independent choices of y, yet there is a smaller dimensional space of choices of z (Well if |W|=2, this is false, but a different argument is concoctable). Thus there exist elements in the centraliser that are not constructed in the question. Initially there was a question about the braid group Bn here whose existence makes David Hill's first comment understandable. 

Most of the time, H*(BG,p) is a polynomial algebra, generated in the degrees of the Weyl group. The exceptional cases are known as torsion primes. If G is simply connected and simple, there are no such primes in type A or C, they are 2 in types B (except B2), D and G, 2 and 3 in types E6 and E7, and 2, 3 and 5 in E8. A precise definition is in Definition 2.43 of "Parity Sheaves", by Juteau, Mautner and Williamson. To get an idea of the cohomology in one of the unusual cases, there is $$H^*(BSO_3;\mathbb{F}_2)\cong \mathbb{F}_2[b,w] $$ where the generators b and w are in degrees 2 and 3. This is not actually hard to prove via a spectral sequence once you have the guts to believe that the cohomology ring is this big. For a general reference for computing this cohomology ring, look at "Torsion in cohomology of compact Lie groups and Chow rings of reductive algebraic groups" by Kac.
