This shows that a lag of a little over an hour is expected. It seemed to get better later in the day (as they got over the backlog of the overnight deliveries): 

The term for this time is "sleep latency". (Actually Wikipedia prefer Sleep Onset Latency but that doesn't match the literature I was finding.) The calculator makes predictions down to the minute based on this estimate. The figure is not that predictable or precise. Practice Parameters for Clinical Use of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test is a discussion on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test - where patients are given several opportunities throughout the day to fall asleep, and their sleep latency is measured. In Table 3, it gives mean sleep latency of 10.4 +/- 4.3 minutes or 11.6 +/- 5.2 minutes, depending on the protocol used. In Meta-Analysis of Quantitative Sleep Parameters From Childhood to Old Age in Healthy Individuals: Developing Normative Sleep Values Across the Human Lifespan they look at how sleep latency changes over time and between genders. 

They explain it all clearer than I could hope to, and include references to 93 different journal articles. You've got to admit they've certainly done their research on cancer, those guys at err.. Cancer Research UK. Oh look, a donate button. Maybe you can persuade your mistaken friend and his father to donate to make up for all the people they have misled with their ignorance and semantic word games? 

If you are thinking this evidence is pretty weak at putting apples on a pedestal above other fruit, I agree with you. Get some other fruit and veg into you, too. Q: Is eating a lot of apples risky? A: Yes, it can be. For example: 

There is a strong wind weather pattern around Gibraltar called Viento de Levante, which was researched in 1952, but I can't see the actual paper :-( 

This is an example of a specific study that found no correlation. The title pretty much explains the whole study, which took place in the two weeks before and after a law change. 

I started searching, assuming there would be no evidence. I was happy to find there was actually some - perhaps not the strongest, and not enough to start recommending that you take the tablets, but at least there was some. The two most relevant studies I found were these two: 

Two errors were made by Sean Spicer: who was attacked, and who did the attacking. The Anti-Media article in question has a link to an Intercept article that demonstrates that Sean Spicer misspoke and quickly corrected himself when the error in who was attacked was pointed out. He did not "fabricate" or "misrepresent" an attack on the American Navy. 

So, the wings are not the only source of the pathogens. Further, Wikipedia explains that house flies carry a number of different pathogens, including: 

The data shows a small number of participants had only small drops from the baseline (e.g. 5 or 6 instead of 8 expected) over a short period (4 weeks). Given the initial data was what the patients claimed, rather than measured, this seemed to be insignificant. 

They recommend aspirin (or equivalent) for known high risk people. They don't know if it is possible to generally detect high risk people from the healthy population. They don't recommend aspirin for everyone. 

Jo Corbett quotes a personal communication from Blue Magruder, Director of Communications at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH): 

Ellis Silver takes a number of features of human physiology, claims they are inexplicable by evolution, and comes to the extreme conclusion that aliens placed humans on Earth. However, each of the features are actually prosaically explained by evolution. For example: 

However, the Skeptical Science FAQ article above goes on to put those figures in context, so we can see that this data does not contradict the scientific consensus on man-made climate change. It explains that CO2 levels are not the only driver of climate, and that the Sun's output was about 4% lower, that the data for the late Ordovician (450 million years ago) is limited and may be misleading. So Burt Rhutan's data is accurate, but his conclusions ignore other known facts. 

This is an misunderstanding. When it is corrected, the conflict disappears. (The other answers agree that this is a misunderstanding, but I don't think they adequately illustrate that how very incorrect this is.) First, the provided notability link from Wikipedia does not claim that IQ remains the same. It doesn't support this misunderstanding. 

The web-site claims it has been peer-reviewed, but conference proceedings often go through minimal review, I haven't been able to check the level of review at that conference. The argument in the paper is basically as follows: 

I think it was used to hold in place a poultice [e.g.] Such poultices could no longer be recommended where antibiotics and analgesics are available. Alternatively, it may be being used to hold an ice-pack in place.There are plenty of examples of people getting the advice to use ice-packs on tooth pain: [e.g.] 

* Cultural note: They are Dutch researchers in an international journal: I think they are referring to small chilli peppers, not large bell peppers (a.k.a. capsicum). 

Similar techniques were used for their other victims. [Wikipedia references a number of "true crime" books - I have been unable to confirm these passages.] 

They looked at a number of factors - e.g. the performance of the genders in the general population, as well as the mathematically-talented (i.e. at the upper end of the distribution.) 

There are many, many claims here. Some are very broad. (e.g. Cancer is not one disease.) I thought the best way to answer is to list some of the properties of garlic that have been subjected to meta-analysis by the Cochrane Collaboration. 

(This is a summary, there is also important advice provided about when to seek emergency treatment.) 

In 1970, two researchers specialising in the practices of Sexual Freedom movement expressed strong doubt that key parties were popular, describing it as a myth. 

Queensland It is over-simplifying a little, but yes, for Queensland where Kathy Margolis was based, the claim is true. The Teacher's Award for the state of Queensland explains: 

In February 2013, the FDA issued a warning letter to an importer of caffeine powder. In it, the FDA reports that a number of violations to the FDA standards were observed for several imported ingredients. 

In fact, lead poisoning was known as "Potter's Disease". However, with the banning (in the US) of lead in glazes the threat is reduced: 

Minnesota recently mades the news for banning Triclosan, an antibacterial agent used in handwashes, due to potential health risks. (This question is not about those risks.) Those risks must be balanced with the potential for health gains. When it comes to hand-washes, FDA reports: 

Then a review of ivy leaves in particular for children: Efficacy of dry extract of ivy leaves in children with bronchial asthma – a review of randomized controlled trials, D. Hofmanna, M. Heckerb, A. Völpc. Phytomedicine Volume 10, Issues 2-3, 2003, Pages 213-220 doi:10.1078/094471103321659979. 

An important part of conducting an experiment is to have a control to compare it against. We can see that this particular burger doesn't seem to be rotting, but is that unusual or unexpected? Morgan Spurlock, in the movie Super Size me conducted an experiment with a number of McDonald's burgers and burgers from other sources, placing them in glass jars. The results were that all of the burgers were rotting after a few weeks. (Yes, they were at different rates, but larger samples sizes would be required to see if that was was significant, as well as controlling for more variables, like burger size.) Another experiment was started here by Serious Eats. It looked at a number of different questions: 

TL;DR: While there have been individual studies, mostly of low quality, the systematic reviews suggest the evidence is poor. 

But wait, that's only in the home. Why would we ban tobacco in the work-place? Oh, because there is another meta-analysis that shows the effect can be even stronger there!
