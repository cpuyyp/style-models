"First-person inclusive" forms are ones that refer to both the first and second person. In that case, why call them "first-person" anything? Wouldn't it be equally logical to call them "second-person inclusive"? It isn't that there's a division within the first person into inclusive and exclusive forms -- that wouldn't mean anything. Is this just a historical convention, due to the fact that when speakers of a language without such an opposition encounter a language with one, they perceive its inclusive forms to correspond to their own "first-person plural"? Or is it common for inclusive forms to somehow pattern more like first-person than like second-person forms, and if so how? (I realize that you could ask similar questions about the term "first-person plural", since this usually doesn't refer to multiple speakers but to a speaker plus others, and about "second-person plural" when this refers not to multiple listeners but to a listener plus others. But those forms at least can refer to plural speakers or to plural listeners, while an inclusive form can never refer to the first person alone.) 

The question should probably be restated as something like "When did people begin to believe that Romance and Germanic languages were related with some scholarly basis for that belief?" The qualification is necessary because in the pre-modern West, the reigning idea about language diversity was that all languages were ultimately descended from Hebrew through the Tower of Babel story. So educated people would have believed that e.g. German and French were related (as were German and Chinese), but they would have believed it for the wrong reason. Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn is generally credited these days as being the first scholar to make a cogent case for what later became known as the Indo-European family of languages, including the relationship of the Germanic and Romance branches. This is not to say that no one before him may have noticed similarities in basic lexicon between the branches (e.g. kinship terms) and theorized about the reasons for them, and maybe someone here can give a reference to such earlier theorizing, but van Boxhorn appears to have been the first to do so in a systematic way. 

Ancient Greek appears to have been such a language. Although of course we can't know the exact phonetic correlates of accent in a dead language, it's thought to have been a pitch-accent language, and had phonemic vowel quantity. In fact, it's even more complex in that a high pitch could occur on either mora of a long vowel, so that you get a distinction between V: with all low pitch, V: with high pitch on first mora and low on second, and V: with low pitch on first mora and high on second. Likewise for diphthongs. There are some phonological and morphological constraints on where in the word a high pitch can appear, so there aren't as many strict minimal pairs of the various possible kinds as you might expect, but there are some. Examples, writing a double vowel for a long vowel so that I can show which mora the high tone is on: óomos 'shoulder' / oomós 'raw' phóboon 'of fears' / phobóon 'frightening' paídeusai 'educate!' / paidéusai 'to educate' / paideúsai 'he might educate' eí 'if' / éi 'you are' 

Phonetically, could it be that the former forms one syllable and the latter form two? Yes, exactly, except that this isn't a phonetic distinction but a phonological one. If you have two successive identical vowels, they're always going to form two syllables; if you have one long vowel, it's always going to form one syllable. There can also be phonetic differences in pitch etc., but not necessarily. Are there languages that have both phonemic vowel length and double vowels? Yes. Ancient Greek was such a language; I'm sure there are other examples. 

I would guess that the physiological basis of this widespread metaphor is the fact that the larynx moves down for uttering a low-pitched sound and up for a high-pitched one. 

These definitions aren't contradictory: they all refer to physical contact with some unspecified amount of pressure, and with the possibility of simultaneous movement along the surface. The resulting overall sense is a pretty broad one, but this is often the case with semantic reconstruction: if the reflex in language A means "rub" and the reflex in language B means "press", it's hard or impossible to tell which of the two was the original sense (or whether both are original), and lexicographers are reduced to simply listing both senses. 

It's probably not a substrate effect, but a phonetically caused deletion, seeing as the sound was not lost in all contexts but only in specific conditions. A substrate-based loss would presumably be due to Gaulish not possessing a sound equivalent to that written with Latin v, which may or may not have been the case (depending on what exactly that sound was at that time and place, and on what exact sound the symbol V in Gaulish inscriptions represented). But if so, this would presumably have caused complete loss of the phoneme rather than conditioned deletion. In fact v is regularly lost next to round vowels: pavo:rem > peur, avunculum > oncle, iuvenis > jeune. Between other vowels it generally remains: lavare > laver, levare > lever. Loss of a rounded consonant next to a round vowel is a very common type of assimilation. Cases like alleviare > alléger are part of a different rule, namely that v is lost before most consonants: in this case it was followed by a [j] (which is how the i would have been pronounced in this word in Late/Vulgar Latin). Similarly for civ(i)ta:tem > cité (where the second i would have been lost by syncope). 

Dutch does have two het's. One is the neuter singular definite article, the other is the neuter third-person singular pronoun. Ik heb het huis gezien 'I have seen the house' Ik heb het gezien 'I have seen it' 

In Modern Hebrew, embedded questions are introduced by im 'if', which also introduces conditional protases. E.g.: 

This isn't grammaticalization, because grammaticalization is a process whereby a lexical word becomes a grammatical marker, a.k.a. a functional word (or morpheme). For example, the English future auxiliary will is a result of grammaticalization as it derives from the verb will meaning "want". In this case, because is already a conjunction, so is already "grammatical"; what's changing is that it's starting to allow a new type of complement (arguably extending to be a preposition), but that has nothing to do with grammaticalization. 

It certainly still exists, and FrameNet in particular is an active project; I know a couple of people who work on it. Not quite sure what you mean about whether it gets applied outside of specialized settings. Semantics is a relatively small subfield of linguistics (in terms of people who work on it, I mean, as compared with e.g. phonology or syntax), but frame semantics is definitely among the theories that semanticists work with these days, in the US anyway. 

Radford's Syntax: A Minimalist Introduction was the textbook in my first-year graduate student syntax seminar. As the title implies, it doesn't touch on anything outside Minimalism, but you might still find it useful. 

Gesenius's Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon states that it is the present participle of a root ayin-waw-dalet, meaning 'return' or 'repeat', with an Arabic cognate `āda -- the idea apparently being that a witness is one who 'repeats' what he saw. It's presumably not an Aramaic borrowing, since it occurs already in Genesis. Gesenius lists the meaning 'testimony' in addition to 'witness'. In modern Hebrew, though, it only means 'witness'; 'testimony' is a related noun, edut. As for whether it's related to `ad 'eternity', Gesenius thinks not: he derives the latter from a different root ayin-dalet-he. It seems conceivable that the two roots could be related further back, though; at least, one could certainly imagine a semantic relationship between 'return' and 'eternity'. 

Although fdb is correct that a symbol like *bh should not be taken to imply any specific phonetic content, these phonemes obviously had such content, and it's possible to speculate about what it was. The facts that lead people to think that the PIE "voiced aspirates" were breathy voiced stops as in Indic have to do with their reflexes in the daughter languages, namely: 

This may or may not be true, depending on what is meant by "ultimate source": are we talking about specific letter shapes, or just the abstract principle of an alphabet? If the former, no; if the latter, probably yes. Most alphabets in existence (I'm using the term in its broadest sense to include abjads and abugidas) do straightforwardly descend from the Phoenician script, though often with modifications not only of the letter forms but of the system itself: e.g. the Greek innovation of consistently writing out vowels. One case where there is some controversy is the Brahmi script of India, from which modern south and southeast Asian scripts are descended, but even there the majority opinion is that it derives from some Semitic alphabet (whether or not this was specifically Phoenician). However, there are also alphabets which were deliberate inventions rather than modifications of an existing model: Hangul, for example. The grapheme shapes of Hangul have nothing to do with those of any Phoenician-derived script, so in that sense it isn't a descendant of Phoenician. However, even in these cases, the idea of using an alphabet (rather than, say, a syllabary or a logographic script) seems to have been inspired by some existing alphabet to which the inventors were exposed, which would ultimately have been Phoenician-descended. So in that more abstract sense, all alphabets, as far as I know, are ultimately traceable to Phoenician (or else to another related Semitic alphabet, since Phoenician was not the first of these). 

It would be βεβλέπαται. The [n] between consonants would be syllabic, and syllabic [n] went to [a] in Greek. This is the origin of the -αται 3pl. ending in the forms you mention, and also of 3pl. -ατο in the pluperfect. In some verbs these endings were retained, especially outside of Attic (e.g. Homer or Herodotus); but in Attic, these forms were replaced by periphrases. (Although there are Attic examples of -αται: e.g. Thucydides has τετάχαται, ἐτετάχατο.) Presumably this happened because -αται/-ατο don't look much like 3pl. endings, since they don't have a nasal. 

They were stops. (A change of stops to fricatives in Italic is much more likely than a change of fricatives to stops in all the other languages.) They were voiced. (They're voiced in the large majority of daughter languages; also, Indic has a separate voiceless aspirate series with which they contrast.) They seem, on the evidence of Indic and Greek, to have had some kind of phonation feature that distinguished them from the plain voiced stops. They must have been distinct from these in some way (since they show different reflexes in about half the branches), and the distinction seems to have had to do with a more open glottis state. 

The first two changes (loss of y and change to e) seem phonetically understandable, though still apparently irregular. But the appearance of t has no plausible phonetic basis that I can see. What are the reasons for these anomalies? 

This is something of a long shot, but I am looking for narratives with English word-by-word glosses in languages that have proximate/obviative marking, direct/inverse marking (aka hierarchical alignment), or preferably both. What I want to know is how frequently in such narratives, and at what points in the narrative, you get topic switching, where a new referent becomes the proximate topic, and also whether and how this is overtly marked. In other words, how continuous the status of something as 'proximate' tends to be, and where in a narrative discontinuity tends to occur. For this, I need word-by-word glosses of naturally occurring narratives, because a translation by itself won't show the proximate/obviative morphology. 

The ancient Greeks and Romans had no concept of historical linguistics or of the Indo-European language family. However, it would have been noticeable to anyone who spoke even a little of both Greek and Latin that they shared many similarities, most obviously in basic vocabulary such as kinship terms and numerals, but also in some of the inflectional endings. Further afield, there would have been some scholars or travelers who had knowledge of other IE languages, such as Persian, or even of Indic or Germanic languages, and who could easily have noticed the same similarities (while, on the other hand, someone familiar with a non-IE language -- Semitic, Etruscan -- could have seen that these shared features were absent there). What did they think the reason for this was? Do we have any surviving writings that address the question of why these languages have so much in common? My guess would be that anyone thinking about this question in those times would have done so in a 'genealogy of peoples' framework, where e.g. the Romans were descended from the Trojans, etc., and tried to explain the linguistic facts that way. But do we actually know? 

One of the lexical similarities between reconstructed Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Uralic is in the interrogative and relative pronouns. For the former, in PIE there's a family of interrogatives beginning *kw-, e.g. Latin quis 'who?', quo 'whither?', while on the Uralic side there is e.g. Finnish ku-ka 'who?'. For the relative, there's PIE *yo-, giving e.g. Greek hos '(he) who', while Uralic shows e.g. Finnish jo-ka 'who'. Proponents of the Indo-Uralic hypothesis see these as cognates; opponents see them as borrowings from IE into Uralic. It seems bizarre that such items could be borrowed, but stranger things have happened... Or have they? Are there any attested cases of a language borrowing an interrogative or relative pronoun? 

Indo-European is not a language family known for discontinuous morphology, but there are occasional examples. I can think of two: 

Eat that pizza! *There's a pizza on the table, which eat! (="which I order you to eat") *I told you eat that pizza! 

A long o-grade in a Greek agent noun in -ter is at best unusual. I can't think of another such example, at any rate. The -a- of the second syllable is long, as shown by Attic-Ionic Δημήτηρ. Of course, one could invoke folk etymology here, so this isn't conclusive. The vowel in the first syllable in the more common forms of the name, Δημήτηρ / Δαμάτηρ, cannot come from PIE *ō. It's pretty clear that Δαμάτηρ is a compound of Δα-μάτηρ, since the first element seems to occur in the name of Poseidon: Potei-dāōn 'husband of Da' (which he isn't in the traditional mythology, but seems to have formerly been). It's not clear why an earth goddess should be named 'Tamer'.
