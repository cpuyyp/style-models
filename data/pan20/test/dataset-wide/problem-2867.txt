When a philosopher talks about 'tensed' vs. 'untensed' theories of time, he/she is likely talking about A-series and B-series. Now, it is important to note that these are not the only ways to think about time; indeed, of the philosophers surveyed, 58% reject both! 

Practical reason is the ability to form long-term goals and then successfully achieve them. From Somatic marker hypothesis: 

Regardless of right vs. left mythology, human psychology does seem to break down into the above two natural kinds—at least, the above two categories form helpful extremes. Now, many modern scientists tend to accept philosophy that is, or is derivative of, Logical Positivism. Today people tend to call themselves 'naturalists' or 'empiricists' or 'physicalists' ('materialist' has gone out of fashion, given the preeminence of thinking in terms of energy in physics today), and while only LP strictly entails being 'tough-minded', many seem to be nonetheless. An example can be found in the article Heretic: Who is Thomas Nagel and why are so many of his fellow academics condemning him? Roughly, rationalistic philosophy values coherence and beauty over specific matching of reality in all respects, while empiricist philosophy values correspondence with reality over coherence and unity. This needs verifying, but I suspect that rationalistic philosophy has not been credited with much advancing of science in the last several hundred years, while empiricist philosophy has. Massimo Pigliucci suggests this might be a problem: 

If you know what you're looking for, you can see 'Baconian science' written all over this. What you get if you attempt to view human beings as objects to be controlled is something like what Charles Taylor calls the "punctual self" in his Sources of the Self. Human beings become objects to be manipulated and control to one's whim—but whose whim? BF Skinner is famous for wanting to control and manipulate humans (for their well-being, of course!); his follies are well-illustrated by Noam Chomsky's famous The Case Against B.F. Skinner. Humans are beings to be understood In contrast to the "punctual self", see James Hillman's Healing Fiction: 

I'd encourage you to watch these Numberphile videos where various charismatic mathematicians talk about infinity. They're delightful and will provide you with all sorts of insight into how important and practical infinity is. Also how bad most people's understand of infinity is. In particular... 

Another way to look at it, your argument is circular. Your inductive proof that there is an infinite set of cities assumes there is an infinite set of cities to draw from. 

Let's put these two together. The first seems assert that every concept which cannot be physically represented is false. The second builds on that by saying if you don't actually count to infinity, infinity is false. Ok, let's imagine a world without infinity. That means there has to be a biggest number. What's the biggest number? Here, I'll pick one. 1,000,000,000,000. There. I have just asserted the biggest number. What happens if I add one to it? 1,000,000,000,001. A new biggest number! Do it again: 1,000,000,000,002. A new biggest number! Do it again: 1,000,000,000,003. A new biggest number! Do it again: 1,000,000,000,004. A new biggest number! For any biggest number you can imagine, you can add one to it to get a bigger number. I don't actually need to keep at this task, it's enough to prove the potential of their existence were you to keep at the task. Same as I can add 10 + 20 without actually moving little groups of objects around. This is the great utility of mathematics, I don't need to move physical things around to do math. Concepts which don't have a physical form are not false, they just don't have physical form. If I have an idea to build a house slightly different from all other houses it's not a false concept on a house. We know houses work. This particular house just doesn't have physical form yet. But wait! It gets worse! (Or better depending on how you look at it) 

Such a person need not assert that there aren't ten dimensions. Should he/she do that, he/she would be in error. 

Neuroscientist Antonio Damasio describes what happens when you have brain lesions in areas associated with emotions: 

Furthermore, the idea that religion is merely a linear combination of { explanation, control } is not clearly supported by the evidence. For example, is the following 'control': 

There's actually a way to talk about this idea with physics: invariants. A well-known invariant is the conservation of mass–energy. In a closed system, we strongly believe that while energy can move from one place to another, it is never created nor destroyed. Barfield claims that we need an invariant to have it be 'evolution' instead of "one-damn-thing-after-another". He doesn't use the word 'invariant'; instead, he uses the word 'spirit'. The spirit stays the same while other things change; indeed, Barfield has the spirit causing the change. Philosopher Jonathan Pearce recently posted The “I”, personhood and abstract objects, in which he argues against the existence of a "continuous 'I'". In other words, there is nothing to a person which keeps him/her the same person over some time period. There is no continuous 'identity'. If there is no continuous identity of persons, surely there is no continuous identity of groups of people, including villages and nations. It seems to me that maybe Hegel is using the idea of a spirit to unify a group of people. From what you say, he also has the spirit acting on groups of people, like Barfield. One could say that the spirit very gently manipulates people, a bit like the recent experiment Facebook ran on manipulating people's emotions. Perhaps spirits use some sort of nonlocal causation, which cannot even be identified without "zooming out" enough. 

Your induction draws from a set of city names. However, you have failed to show a proof that there is an infinite number of city names (and that all those cities exist). This is like saying... 

Sure you can! Infinitely! What happens when you mix red and green? Yellow! What if you mix yellow and red? And the result of that mixing with red again? And that with red again? And again? And again? And again? Each will be a slightly different color. This is similar to what you get when you try to find the smallest fraction. What's halfway between 1 and 2? 1.5. Between 1 and 1.5? 1.25. Between 1 and 1.25? 1.125. And so on. The difference is paint is made up of discrete molecules and eventually you'll have nothing but red left. Numbers don't have an end and you can just keep on dividing. Not only is there an infinity of numbers, there are infinities between every number! The infinite set of positive integers is countably infinite meaning you can potentially count them without leaving any gaps. The infinity between the real numbers is uncountably infinite meaning you can never list them all out (I realize this is not the formal definition). Every time you try to count them you create more gaps to fill in. This is the infinity of the very small. 

Infinity isn't "playing with notation". Without infinity basic math does not work. It would be inconsistent. Without infinity there must be a "biggest number" and that breaks math. For example, for the set of positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...) it can be said that if then . But what if N is the biggest number? If M is greater than N, then M must be the biggest number. Contradiction! This might not seem like a big deal, but in mathematics a system which contains contradictions is false. Without infinity integer addition does not work. Similar problem with the infinitely small and division of the real numbers. If then because . But what if N is the smallest number? If M is less than N, then M must be the smallest number. Contradiction! Without infinity there are no irrational numbers, numbers which have infinite, non-repeating decimals. Pi is an irrational number. Without Pi, we can't work with circles. No infinity, no mathematics. (You can construct mathematical systems without infinity, but they're not nearly as useful.) 

It may help to think about this topic by eliminating the concept of time. What we want to ask is something like the following: 

The following seems fairly well-accepted these days among social scientists, but it is worth adding: 

You can learn more about this from somatic marker hypothesis, and especially via looking at "VMPFC patients", who are people who have brain lesions which very likely hinder the brain's access to emotion information. These people exhibit very poor goal-directed behavior, suggesting that emotions are more important and function differently than we are want to believe. The very book title, Descartes' Error, is meant to attack Cogito ergo sum. I used to really like Descartes' saying; now I am much more drawn to Augustine's Si enim fallor, sum. It is also worth asking what the connections are between what you mean by 'emotions', and: 

Check out U. Wash David Levy's Google Tech Talk No Time to Think (pdf). I especially suggest a book to which he refers, Josef Pieper's Leisure: The Basis of Culture. Pieper warns of the notion of "total work", which I think connects to your idea of "mental slavery". Pieper wrote the German form of Leisure in Germany in 1948, during reconstruction. He was worried that the Germans would get locked into a world of "total work", and have no time for what he calls "leisure"—which is not to be confused with popping open a beer, plopping down on the couch, and turning on one's favorite professional sports. He anticipated the objection that the Germans needed to work really hard now, and could enjoy their fruits—including leisure—after they had finished rebuilding. Allan Bloom describes this as having happened to the West—specifically, America—in The Closing of the American Mind:
