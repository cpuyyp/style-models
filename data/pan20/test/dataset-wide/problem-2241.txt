This is actually a fairly standard warning message for U.S. Government systems. It dates back to a 1986 law (Public Law 99-474) and a time when it was considered necessary to display such warnings in order for computer crime prosecutions to be successful. (Otherwise a person might argue they didn't know they were trespassing, or something along those lines.) While it appears you can also register by mail or fax, I would have no problem using the online system to register a beacon. It is the stated purpose of the site and consistent with the directives given both on the beacon and on the noaa.gov site itself. If it helps, I would also argue that those instructions constitute authorization, though I seriously doubt you would ever have need to make that argument. 

I would call it a basic munter hitch. Take the eye in the end of the cord (through which you are pushing the bight in the first image) and imagine it to be a carabiner. This should make the structure more obvious. A difference between this and a Purcell Prusik is that the prusik can slip when catching a fall, absorbing some energy that would otherwise be passed along to you. As to whether it can hold a fall, that would depend on circumstance and the type of cord used. Dyneema cord would obviously fare worse than nylon, but presumably if you're sinking the shaft into the snow you're not on pure vertical terrain and probably also standing below the axe. The wisdom of leashing or not leashing an axe to one's harness has been debated in many places; you should be aware of the risks of either method. ref for PP slippage: $URL$ 

All of the listed reasons hold true, and can largely be simplified to the fourth: never let go of the brake strand unless you have tied it off. This maintains good habits and also mitigates potential accidents. In the past, such devices have been considered hands-free if monitored (i.e. you're sitting next to it, the ropes are running cleanly, and you're just grabbing a sandwich or a drink). It may be that more conservative approaches will develop over time, but this is one case where there still appears to be a general tolerance for taking a hand off. (Whether the manufacturer's instructions agree with this is a different question.) A Reverso (or any similar device) used in guide mode has some potential failure modes: The first failure mode to watch for is when the rope does not run in line with the brake strand. E.g. if the anchor is offset from the last piece of protection, when the rope comes tight in a fall it might run across the side of the device instead of over the brake strand. Result: the brake strand is not captured and no braking occurs. A second potential failure mode is for the loaded strand to "pop" under the brake strand or jam alongside it. The latter case is not immediately dangerous, but will require work to unbind the strands. The former case will result in very little braking power, which is a Bad Thing. These cases can be mitigated against by making sure the ropes are running in the correct direction and that the rope diameters are well within the sizes the devices are rated for.

If something goes wrong, the information you provide your emergency contact will be the starting point for the information Search and Rescue groups use to look for you. Much of this information will remain the same for multiple trips and some will be trip-specific. The items I list won't be comprehensive, but rather a selection of items from an online trip-report form that was created for just this purpose. Thus, you can prepare in advance a packet with most of the information and just update the trip details each time you head out. Identity Information 

To me it seems the finished product is similar to a small rescue spider. For a simpler version I would be tempted to take a sling, fold it in two, and tie a figure-8 using all the strands. 

The National Weather Service offers a REST Web Service to provide forecast data in XML format. You can request forecast data using latitude and longitude, start and end dates, and forecast data element. If you have an DeLorme inReach satellite communicator, you're in luck as someone has already set up an experimental service to parse messages from it and reply with a forecast for your location. Otherwise, setting up your own server to handle requests from your satellite communicator of choice shouldn't be particularly difficult. 

The first solution that comes to mind is a "zeer", or pot-in-pot refrigerator. However, this functions best in hot and dry environments as it relies on evaporation to work. Such a device is constructed by nesting one clay pot inside another, with a layer of sand between them (about an inch on the bottom, a few inches on the sides). The sand is then soaked with water until saturated. The food goes into the inner pot, which can then be covered with a sheet of wet burlap. 

There's a decent thread discussing this issue over at BPL. Based on that and similar discussions, my suggestions would be as follows: 

Find a branch about 6 meters (20 feet) above the ground. When finally hung the bag should be about 2 meters (~6 feet) away from the trunk, 2 meters below the branch, and about 4 meters (12 feet) above the ground. Use a small throw bag (e.g. pouch with rocks) to toss your line over the branch. Use a carabiner to attach the line to your food bag, then clip the other side of the line into the carabiner. Hoist the bag until it touches the branch. Reaching as high as you can, tie a clove hitch around a small stick. Allow the bag to come back down. The stick should be blocked at the carabiner (about halfway between the branch and "as high as you can reach"). 

Aside from the slip hitch*, you can also use a girth hitch or clove hitch to sling a chicken head (or similar protrusion). The slip hitch will place only a single strand around the object, which may be helpful if space is limited or if you need the additional length. It's very easy to remember and tie, although with practice a clove hitch can also be quickly placed one-handed. Since you mention the other strand won't support tension, I assume you also figured out that the slip hitch is structurally similar to a Reepschnur rappel; pulling on the wrong strand will cause the slipped strand to pull through and eventually there is no more loop. This is why you should be tying it with a sling rather than the rope itself. (And yes, you can also add an overhand in the sling if you want.) The slip hitch isn't one that immediately comes to mind when I think of climbing knots, although it might be the first thing to mind if I wanted to quickly hang some gear. (When done, unhook the gear and just pull the strand to undo the knot.) *Technically any knot can be "slipped" by inserting a bight rather than the end of a rope; pulling the end allows the knot to be undone. The standard shoelace knot is an example of a slipped reef knot (a.k.a. square knot).
