Ok, let me try. (translation is off the top of my head, so check with the oxford translation). Ὁμώνυμα λέγεται ὧν ὄνομα μόνον κοινόν, "Things are said to by `homonyms' which have one name in common, . . ." ὁ δὲ κατὰ τοὔνομα λόγος τῆς οὐσίας ἕτερος, " but the account of its being corresponding to the name (kata tounoma) is different . . . " οἷον ζῷον ὅ τε ἄνθρωπος καὶ τὸ γεγραμμένον τούτων γὰρ ὄνομα μόνον κοινόν, "just as a living thing and a drawing of one have one name in common . . ." ὁ δὲ κατὰ τοὔνομα λόγος τῆς οὐσίας ἕτερος ἐὰν γὰρ ἀποδιδῷ τις τί ἐστιν αὐτῶν ἑκατέρῳ τὸ ζῴῳ εἶναι, ἴδιον ἑκατέρου λόγον ἀποδώσει. " because the account of being corresponding to the name differs, . . ." the rest of the clause gets confusing after that though. I'd say that what Aristotle means by λόγος τῆς οὐσίας has pretty well got to be what a contemporary philosopher would call a real definition. On Aristotle's view, we get definitions by empirical inquiry--gathering things together into genera and species in terms of their likenesses and differences, and then a definition (horismos or logos) which expresses the essence of the thing is just a summary of these genera and the specific differences, e.g. ``Man is a rational animal.'' His point in this paragraph is that mere linguistic use can be deceptive. Sometimes we use the same sound to name two things that in themselves have radically different natures. Aristotle's example is a man and a picture of a man, which apparently could both be called an 'anthropos' in Greek. A better English example might be a 'bank', which could be either the side of a river, or a financial institution. There is nothing that riversides and financial institutions have in common, so the use of the word "bank" is ambiguous in just this way. The importance of Aristotle's point here will only really become apparent in the Analytics, when he is describing the kind of logical unity required for scientific inquiry. There he lays down the condition that you can't transfer scientifically proven conclusions about the nature of humans to pictures of humans. This is Aristotle's way of pointing out the fallacy of equivocation. There is one more wrinkle, that is a famous issue in Aristotle's metaphysics and that is that Aristotle recognizes a special subset of homonyms where there is enough relation between the different senses to allow us to investigate them all under one science. He calls this "pros hen equivocity" although it's sometimes known in the literature as "focal meaning" or in older medieval texts as "the doctrine of analogy". This is how Aristotle is able to reconcile his claim that "being" is not a univocal notion--chairs and redness don't "exist" in the same sense, with his claim that metaphysics is the science of being qua being. 

That argument is valid. But I question its soundness. Someone else has also queried the truth of (1) and (2), but I'm also worried about (3). Maybe capitalism causes some problems and solves others and the magnitude of the solutions is greater than the magnitude of the new problems introduced. That would suggest that capitalism is limited in that it can't provide some solutions without introducing other problems, but not that it is utterly self-defeating. 

Empiricism is the thesis that knowledge comes from experience. Logical positivism is the thesis that the meaning of a sentence is the set of conditions under which that sentence could be verified to be true. (This implies that any sentence which cannot be verified empirically is either meaningless nonsense, or a tautology.) All logical positivists are empiricists, but not all empiricists are logical positivists. For instance, Aristotle would agree that all knowledge comes from sensation. (To my knowledge, he is actually the first to make this claim.) However, Aristotle might well reject that a sentence is meaningful even if there is no way for us to tell whether it's true or not. (I can't think of any examples of sentences that Aristotle would take to be like that, but I also can't think of any reason he would have to deny this either.) 

It seems to me that the uniqueness of i simply has follow from i's distinctness from -i. i has to be the unique object picked out by the definite description "the imaginary unit" rather than not -i. But, what you have here looks to be a neat argument for what metaphysicians call haecceities (>Latin "thisness"). The idea is that everything must have something unique to it which is not some normal qualitative property, but rather a bare individual non-qualitative property. I was going to suggest writing this argument up, but it looks somebody's beat you to the punch already. Cf. $URL$ and $URL$ 

So, I'm not sure what motivates the position you're talking about. But off the cuff, my response would be: X's property p is whatever makes the sentence "x is p" true. A quality is just a particular kind of intrinsic property. Color is a quality. So are texture and temperature. So, all qualities are properties, but not vice versa. Here's a property that isn't a quality--being a father. It is true of me that i'm a father, but that isn't an intrinsic fact about what I am like, it's true in virtue of relationship I have to something outside of me. 

The KK principle doesn't imply that everything that is true is already known. That's a very different claim. There are people who endorse it--Kant does, for instance. But many contemporary philosophers would take this to lead to some kind of pernicious idealism. What the KK principle says is that everything you know, you know that you know. If I know paris is the capital of france, then I know that I know that paris is the capital of france. In other words, knowledge is transparent. It is impossible for me to have some knowledge which I am unaware of. The reason to hold some thesis like this is a claim about the nature of knowledge. If you think to have knowledge is to have some evidence, or something like that, then you'd be attracted to the principle. On the other hand, if you think that knowledge can be produced by reliable belief forming processes or something that operate whether you are conscious of them or not, then you'd want to deny the principle. it is clear that you can fashion consistent epistemic logics either with or without the KK principle, so the question whether the KK principle is true or not isn't a logical, but a philosophical question. 

If you think that concept is useful, but theories about it are seriously mistaken because there us something simple to say instead, then you are a deflationist about that concept. If you think the whole concept is a mistake, there's nothing like it at all, etc, then you are an eliminativist about that concept. 

My ultimate goal here would be to create the text and then start a kickstarter to crowd-fund the development of a set of software packages for the student and instructor. If there were enough funding, I might even consider doing the Khan Academy thing and creating a series of videos teaching through the book. What do people think about that? What kind of software would be useful to you, as a student or instructor? Are there any logic teachers here interested in the "flipped classroom" approach that think these tools would be helpful to them? 

The answer is that there are different notions of possibility. Conceivability only entails the very weakest kind, which is logical possibility. To introduce the idea of different kinds of possibility, consider the difference between what is humanly possibly and what is technologically possible. It is not possible for a human, by simply moving their limbs, to travel 100 miles per hour. But given some automobile technology, this becomes possible. In other words, traveling a hundred miles an hour is prohibited by the limitations of the stronger sense of what is "humanly possible," but permitted by the weaker sense of what is "possible with the aid of technology." The kind of possibility which is supposed to be guaranteed by conceivability is mere logical possibility. This is the weakest kind of possibility of all, because it says that something isn't prohibited by the laws of logic. So, the mere fact that something is conceivable just means it isn't prohibited by the laws of logic, although it could still be prohibited, by the laws of physics, say. Is this weak form of possibility at all useful? It turns out that it is. Identity, for instance, seems to be a necessary relation, which means that if two things are identical, they have to be identical. Which means that if it is logically possible for one to exist without the other, then they must be distinct. If that's right, then all we need to do to show that A != B is that one can conceive of A existing without B existing. 

I'm apparently not seeing what a "duration" or "interval" is supposed to be such that the answer to this question isn't just obviously Yes. Here's an interval of time: 24 hours. The interval begins when I start the clock running at 12pm Monday, and that interval ends at 12pm Tuesday. It's no good to say "well that's just clock time, not lived, phenomenological time" or something like that, because I experience things beginning and ending and time elapsing in between. I think that question about immortality is confused. Here's a claim that might be true: I don't experience the end of my life, because by the time my life ends, I'm no longer there to be the subject of that experience. That's an epistemological claim about what kinds of things I can experience happening to me. "I cannot die" is an ontological claim that is not about the limits of my experience. The epistemological claim might be true (although I have my doubts), but the ontological one is clearly false. 

There are quite a few really interesting and fundamental problems being actively researched today. I'll give a selective list of just some problems in metaphysics that are particularly important. One such problem is the Problem of Material Constitution. The problem is a generalization of the ship of theseus problem: the challenge is to explain how it is possible for a thing composed of parts to survive the change of its parts. Another really fundamental problem is to explain laws of nature. What are they? Is it necessary that they be what they are, or only contingent? Another hot topic is research on dispositions, like a glasses fragility or an HCl molecule's solubility. These are interesting properties that are absolutely central to the philosophy of chemistry, but understanding them requires a very sensitive analysis in modal logic and from what I can tell much of that work is still underway. 

In both the Aristotelian tradition and the tradition of contemporary metaphysics "essences" are discovered empirically. An essence is the thing expressed by a definition of a kind of object. Empirical science is in the business of discovering such definitions. (I'm bracketing here some difficult questions about biology--it's not clear ALL sciences are about finding essences, just that some sciences are concerned with this.) Here's an example of the kind of thing that I have in mind: "Gold is the element with atomic number 79." "Water is H2O." These are genuine statements of the essence of a kind, in the sense that these definitions give necessary and sufficient conditions for a particular individual being a member of that kind. If an atom doesn't have 79 protons in its nucleus, it's not a gold atom. If a molecule doesn't have exactly two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen bound together in the right configuration, then it's not a water molecule. If this is right, then there's nothing particularly difficult about getting to know some essences, since none of those sentences are controversial as items of empirical knowledge. 

The problem is that Plato fails to make a distinction that Aristotle later discovered. Some times a thing comes into existence that didn't exist beforehand, like when I form a pot out of some clay. (Call this generation) Other times, a thing that already exist undergoes a change (call this alteration) like when I take a pot that is not currently red and paint it red. Now in order for an alteration to happen, it looks like we have to have something like what Plato says--the pot "becomes" red when I paint it at 3pm if and only if it was the opposite, i.e. non-red before 3pm, otherwise it wouldn't be "becoming" red at all. The problem is that Plato thinks this model of change coming about by opposites is the only model of change, but he is neglecting the difference between generation and alteration. He is trying to say that the soul must still exist when the body is dead because there has to exist something x which is dead at 2:59pm and alive at 3:00pm because change comes about through opposites. However, this does not follow. Consider the case of making the pot out of clay. The pot doesn't exist at 2:59, but it does at 3:00 (suppose I'm very quick at making pots). How is that possible? Is it the case that: 

Are you reading Naming and Necessity or the paper Identity and Necessity? If you're just looking at N&N, then I encourage you to look at the paper, because Kripke there gives a pretty slick argument for the necessity of identity that is perfectly straightforward. It starts from Leibniz's Law, which Kripke (plausibly) takes a kind of implicit definition of the very notion of identity: (1) for all x, y (if x = y, then (if Fx, then Fy)) [premise] The only other premise we need is the perfectly obvious truth that: (2) for all x, it is necessarily the case that x = x. [premise] The clever trick is that we instantiate (1) with the property of being necessarily identical to x for the dummy predicate F to obtain: (3) for all x, y (if x = y, then (if necessarily x = x, then necessarily x = y)). [from 1, by universal instantiation.] And now, we universal instantiate (3) to get: (4) if x = y, then necessarily x = y [universal instantiation (3)] and then: (5) necessarily x = y [from 2, 4, modus ponens]. that's the argument that identity is necessary. Now the other philosophical question is what does the necessity of identity show us? That question is much more open ended and difficult to answer. Certainly the immediate consequence of Kripke's argument was to pose some difficulties for physicalist philosophers of mind in the 60s (who thought that the mind = the brain's activity, but that this was merely contingent. NOTE this isn't an argument against physicalism, just one particular flavor of it popular in the 50s-60s.) The issue about "essentialism" is somewhat different. Kripke also believes that the names of natural kind terms are "rigid designators", which refer to the same kind necessarily. Whether Kripke is right that natural kinds terms are rigid designators is a separate issue from the question whether identity is necessary or contingent. 

In Olbers' case, he actually did those things. He did amateur astronomy at nights after his medical practice. He corresponded with other astronomers. He had taken university courses in mathematics and astronomy. Rand didn't, and that's why she's a crank. Since she didn't engage the existing literature, she wasn't aware of how sophomoric and shoddy her own work actually was. If she had actually gone through the difficult process of learning the discipline, she might have made important contributions, but she did not. 

Everything that is physically possible is logically possible, but the converse isn't true. There is no magic in any physically possible world, because the existence of magic would violate the law of conservation of energy. 

There are two important logical results that suggest there are unknown truths. The first are Gödel's incompleteness theorems. These imply that there are mathematical statements that are "independent" (i.e. neither provable nor disprovable) from the axioms of arithmetic. This means that there might be mathematical truths we can't ever prove. The second, less well-known logical result that might interest you is called Fitch's Paradox, or the Paradox of Unknowability. The conclusion of this argument is straightforward: There are some unknowable truths. The interesting thing about Fitch's paradox is that if it is correct, then some important substantive philosophical theses about the nature of knowledge must be false. For instance, Kant thought that just what it was to say that something was "true" was to say that it is knowable by somebody.* Obviously if there are unknowable truths, then that can't be right. Fitch's paradox remains controversial. That should be enough to get you started. *I'm not an expert in Kant, so don't just take my word for this. But this is the standard "kantian" position among anti-realists today, whether it is fair to impute this view to Kant himself or not.
