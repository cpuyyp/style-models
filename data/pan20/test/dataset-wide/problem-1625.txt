A highly publicized study in the news this week has been used in a slew of articles to suggest that drinking several cups of coffee a day will extend your life.

Conclusion Resources seem to suggest that intermittent fasting is a feasible way to increase autophagy, but by no means suggest that this is the best (most effective or healthiest) method. Many sources suggest that mere caloric restrictions, not outright fasting, are the key. There are some very popular diets that specifically target autophagy. The Atkins Diet relies heavily on ketosis as a method of reducing body fat, which, in itself, could be considered a form of cellular autophagia. [Ref] It remains to be shown (by my research) whether intermittent fasting promotes autophagy in infected cells where it wouldn't otherwise be triggered, or whether the promotion of autophagy in healthy cells improves to immune function. 

It's common knowledge that actively heating brewed coffee causes a bitter taste. This is most commonly observed on a coffee brewer warming plate after some time (note that these plates are specifically designed to keep coffee warm and not spoil it). When reheating cold coffee, it should be quite easy to heat a bit too much. This would naturally cause a bitter, unpleasant taste. This is probably the origin of the belief. 

The idea of Valkee headsets is bright light therapy with a twist—the light is channeled through the ear canal, directly to the brain. It should come as no surprise that the products have been greeted with great skepticism. What is a bit surprising is that a nontrivial amount of scientific evidence is given to support the headsets' efficacy. The major claims made are as follows: 

For 7.6 minutes the water usage is 114 liters, which requires 6.84kWh to heat. The CO2 equivalent from taking the shower is thus 0.15kg. This is just 3.6% of what the car is using so it's quite negligible. The total For most foods other than pork, beef or lamb, the total energy consumption is below what the car uses. For example, eating only chicken, the bicyclist's total would be 1.75kg, which is significantly less than the car. The limit where the bicycle pollutes more than the car is if the food creates more than 4.17 g/kcal CO2 equivalents. So the bicyclist can easily afford to eat some beef, if the main energy source is vegetables. 

I doubt we'll find a resolution to this particular case. It seems like it hit the news in March 2010 and I don't see any updates. The hits that are out there appear to be regurgitations of one another, such as this, this, and this. What I can do with an answer is state that cutaneous horns are a real phenomenon. Thus, it very well might be that this woman has sprouted an animal-like horn. Wikipedia has an article on cutaneous horns which states: 

Yes, it appears to be significant and valid. Update: due to the questions below on scale, I have emailed the author of the paper, Dr. Yuji Ohya, to request his input on any potential issues with the increased size that will be required for industrial applications. Here is the email. 

Dr. Mercola has released the following article: The Vitamin that is Better than Fluoride in Reducing Cavities. He quotes the VitaminD Council as his source for this: 

The moist environment has the bonus of sustaining a provisional extra-cellular matrix throughout the healing process, facilitating cell migration and ultimately, epithelialization. This results in less visible scarring once the wound is healed. [3] [1] Update on wound dressings: Indications and best use [2] NYT Health [3] Medscape - Surgical Dressings 

Intermittent fasting leads to increased autophagy Autophagy in the Pathogenesis of Disease (2008) is one study that mentions the effects of fasting in particular: 

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening above the age of 20 , but Canada only recommends screening for ages 40 or over. [Ref] Many articles discussing high cholesterol in young men are due to genetic factors (Familial Hypercholesterolemia), not eating habits. See "Coronary flow reserve is impaired in young men with familial hypercholesterolemia" from Journal of the American College of Cardiology Volume 28, Issue 7, December 1996, Pages 1705-1711. [Ref] So to answer your question, Yes, it is possible to eat enough fats that cholesterol becomes a significant risk factor for heart attacks by the age of 21? However, this is only a high risk if you have a genetic predisposition (Familial Hypercholesterolemia). Cases of hypercholesterolemia induced cardiac arrest are relatively extremely rare in non-genetically predisposed youth, but do exist. [Ref] 

And here's the calculation. The initial assumption is that the choice between car and bicycle doesn't affect the amount of other exercise. In practice, it might be different, but this is the only way we can calculate. Car CO2 emissions for the average new car in 2006 were 167.2 g/km, so let's assume this amount. For 25km the car pollutes 4.18 kg CO2. Bicycle The extra food may be significant Riding a bicycle uses up 1.62 kJ/(km∙kg). Let's assume the rider weighs 80kg, which is below or above average for a male depending on country. Allow 20kg for bike, clothes etc. and we have 100kg. Thus the 25km takes 4050kJ total -- that is 967 kcal. Now, the food CO2 equivalent per kcal depends a lot on the type of food. For example: 

The extra shower doesn't really matter The bicyclist also takes an extra shower. Let's use the same assumptions as a CBC campaign: 

I'm specifically targeting the second claim in this question. The evidence for the photosensitivity of the brain doesn't imply that pointing LEDs in your ear canal is beneficial in any way. And it seems the evidence for the benefits is significantly thinner. Is the evidence Valkee produce good enough, or is the methodology and the connections between the industry and the researchers problematic? Have the results been verified independently? 

Autophagy leads to improved immune function. This question targets improvements to immune function in particular. This is confirmed by the following articles following articles. 

These citations all seem to indicate that, in particular, autophagy of unhealthy cells is a function of good immune response. *NOTE * My research has yet to show whether autophagy of healthy cells contributes specifically to improved immune function. 

This study focused on Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, and how intermittent fasting increased autophagy of Schwann cells (which is apparently a good thing). One final article, a little older than the others, but that will probably interest you more, is a generic treatment of how autophagy is triggered by caloric restriction and leads to a decrease in age-related manifestations that are a result of reduced autophagic activities. [6] *NOTE * My research has yet to show whether intermittent fasting leads to increased autophagy of infected cells that would not normally undergo autophagy as part of the natural immune response. 

I can't tell from the manuals whether cracking is the concern, or whether it's scratches/uneven pressure. To see if cracked glass was a real concern, I tried finding complaints online about this issue. After all, if this truly happens, individuals should be complaining and asking for input after it happens to them! Alas, no such luck. While absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence, I would have expected to find more online in forums if this was a common occurrence. 

This is reproduced elsewhere, but also without any source for the origin of the claim. For example, see his entry at the site Roman-Catholic-Saints.com: 

HERE is a 2011 World Health Organization (WHO) report about alcohol consumption. Download it HERE and scroll down to Appendix III, Alcohol Consumption Data. Here are the countries in Russia's ballpark, rates in liters per capita for those over 15 years of age: 

Thus, we see a see higher rates of ownership for households with more individuals living in them. I said "potentially" above, as we don't know the ages of these increased individuals. I will say, there's an obvious dip for three person households, so perhaps two parents with one child are seen with pets less often, and thus this hypothesis was created? Pure speculation, but I did see the big dip between two and four person households. 

If you look at the section entitled Refutations of emission theory, you'll see some of the most concrete examples of how this was shown not to hold true for light. One convincing argument comes just from looking up at the night sky: 

de Sitter's double star argument Experiments (similar to Michelson--Morley which was already mentioned) can measure photons from the same source travelling both in the same direction of earth's travel, and in the opposite direction of earth's travel. In the world of classical mechanics, one would expect the one launched in the direction of earth's travel to get a fixed distance away from the source faster, but experiments repeatedly show that both travel the same distance in the same time. 

I've heard anecdotes time and time again from people with allergies that their parent ate a lot of the food they're allergic too while pregnant. Is there any known correlation? Alright, let's jazz up this question with some sources: 

So, we can see that late shifting results in a decrease in fuel economy. In automatic transmission cars, "flooring it" will result in the car being kept in as low of a gear as possible, thus bypassing the optimum shift point for maximum fuel economy. I wish the sources had been as simple as "faster acceleration yields lower fuel economy," but it wasn't quite that simple. For instance, I was quite surprised to find that more powerful cars did not suffer as badly from aggressive acceleration in the second source! The overall convergence of the sources is that faster acceleration (or at the very least, not shifting as speed increases) yields lower fuel economies. 

For one last thought... we are quite ignorant of all the variables involved the body's healing. One's outlook, the placebo effect, stress levels, etc. I wouldn't doubt that one's psychological disposition due to the presence of a beloved pet really could have an effect -- I just don't think there's anything particularly amazing about the "power of a purr" at this particular moment :) 

This calculation is pretty much worst-case for the bicycle. It doesn't take into account that food production has actually stored CO2 from the atmosphere which is now just released back, while fuel was originally underground and its CO2 is added to the carbon cycle. Neither does it take into account mercury/other emissions, nor the wear-and-tear in cars and bicycles, nor the enormous benefits if the bicyclist doesn't even own a car. A vegetarian bicyclist certainly wins, for a meat-eater it depends. The question is what the bicyclist eats to get the required energy. Estimated from calculations below and this table: 

The article is fun to read but is presented like a conspiracy theory: nobody else tells you this, since they fear Ferrari so much. Does Ferrari really give better cars to the press than they sell to customers? (And by 'better' I mean more suited to the tests that will be performed) 

The article How Ferrari spins by Chris "Monkey" Harris contains claims that Ferrari has dishonest practices with the press. 

To be clear, science has thus far failed to produce reproducible experimental evidence demonstrating a statistically significant genetic predisposition to any sexuality or a lack of one. There are only theories, no consensus. This is part of a much larger problem dubbed "Nature vs. Nurture" that makes it extremely difficult to tell whether a great number of human characteristics (especially psychological) have a genetic predisposition or a purely a result of environmental parameters. 

To me, this is a huge misinterpretation of the observational study (N Engl J Med), which appears to have merely correlated self-proclaimed coffee drinkers with living longer. We know of course that correlation does not imply causation, and the relationship could be due to a number of things, such as the possible fact that coffee drinkers tend to wake up earlier and have more active days, which might improve their overall health. Is there anything in this or any other study to actually suggest a causal relationship between drinking coffee and living longer, or is this being blown out of proportion by popular media?
