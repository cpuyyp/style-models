My belief is that there can be no objective ethics, because in order for their to be objective ethics, we must eventually make an assumption as to what is ultimately important, e.g. we could say life is sacred, and thus it is unethical to arbitrarily take away life. However even the notion that life is sacred is just a bi-product of the evolution process, and in addition, the claim is not scientific, because one cannot perform an experiment to test the assumption that life is sacred or not. Despite this, I have met many people who are of the belief that ethics is objective. Is there a rational argument that can support this view? 

This is more a question of semantics than a question of philosophy. Most can clearly see the similarities and differences between a biological living thing and a language. But whether we call language a living thing or not is merely to do with how broadly we use the term "living thing" in our speech rather than related to the true essence of "language" and "living things". 

I gather your point is that the perceived rate of time is always changing. Similarly one could argue that as one grows taller, their perception of distance and size also changes (i.e. I sometimes see objects now that look tiny compared to how they looked when I was a child). However most people recognize that the objects themselves aren't getting smaller, but rather we are getting bigger and it is our perceptions that are changing. This approach considers ourselves to be subjective observes in an objective universe, and this is also my belief. Similarly for time, I believe we should recognize that while our perceptions of time change, the objective underlying nature of time remains constant (assuming you don't suddenly start travelling very close to the speed of light). In conclusion, the "speed" of time makes about as much sense as the "speed" of distance, which most people are happy to accept does not exist. The rate at which time is perceived to pass however is a logical notion, but the present state of science doesn't allow us to test this. Perhaps in the distant future, neuroscience will be able to measure such a thing. 

Humans are always trying to gain as much control over the world and its resources as they can. We are always obsessed with science and engineering in order to gain knowledge of our world, so that we can control it even further. We even have social sciences to attempt to control our own species. Humans will take any opportunity they can to gain more control over their natural environment, and other humans who form part of the environment are no exception. If a human can control another human with limited repercussions, he will attempt to do so, either subtly or through a formal institution. Because all humans are not made equal (I do not mean this as an ethical statement about human rights, but about the human genome), they will naturally compete for control of each other, and there will be a victor. The victor will naturally dominate the others, simply because he can - and humans will never pass up an opportunity for further control of their available resources. 

Yes. In quantum mechanics, a photon may be in a superposition of horizontal and vertical polarization. Now if this photon is directed towards a filter that allows only vertical light to pass through, does the photon pass through or is the photon reflected? The answer is the photon has a 50% chance of passing through and a 50% chance of being reflected. If the photon passes through, you may say, there must have been a cause for the photon to go through. However, it has been proven that there are no hidden variables that determine whether the photon passes through or not, but rather it is a completely random choice. Therefore some events happen without a cause. 

It is well known that there exists self-referential statements which are neither true or false, such as "I am lying". Is it possible to have statements neither true or false which are not self-referential? Consider the statement, "Alice likes berries". If Alice likes some berries (say grapes), and dislikes other berries (say tomatoes) is the statement "Alice likes berries" neither true or false? My reasoning is that if the statement is true, then one could argue because Alice likes berries, and tomatoes are berries, then Alice likes tomatoes, but this is false. Similarly if the statement is false, then one could argue since Alice doesn't like berries, and grapes are berries, then Alice doesn't like grapes, but this is also a false conclusion. 

My fundamental question here, is does Kant's categorical imperative only make sense when considering ethics among people with similar levels of power? It seems Kant's argument assumes that all people are of equal importance and power. This is often not the case and for instance how would Kant's reasoning apply to animal ethics? I've outlined two examples below to add clarity to my perspective. Suppose you are the only King in the land and you have access to supreme force over the peasants, so there is no chance they can ever revolt and change the order of society. Given that it is impossible for all peasants to perform the actions that you are able to, does this mean that you may do whatever you choose to your subordinates and you will always be acting in a morally appropriate way? A similar example is the power people have over animals. Because animals do not have the power to act on and affect people in the same way people do to them, is this why animals aren't included in Kant's categorical imperative? 

Yes they should have a right to privacy. Why should they be forced to be integrated and consequently almost inevitably become dependent on society. Why would we want them to be integrated against their will? Unaccustomed to modern civilization and the skills valued for employment in our society, these people will probably just become dependent on welfare payments, and be later accused of leeching from society. If they want to be left alone, it is in everyone's best interest to respect that.
