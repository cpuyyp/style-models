Very easy. Kevlar beads are lighter and are used in higher end more expensive tires. Wire beads are heavier and used on less expensive tires. If you are not looking for performance or weight saving, you can safely choose wire bead. 

Use a threadlocker such as Loctite to bond the lever to the axle body. There are two kinds of Loctite: Blue and Red. Blue is weaker and designed for preventing fasteners vibrating loose. Red is stronger, designed to be more permanent and is loosened with heat. Red may be appropriate in this case. Find a bolt that fits the internal thread of the axle body and a nut and washer that fits the bolt. Put the nut and washer on the bolt, screw the bolt into the axle (in place of the lever) tighten the nut against the axle as a locknut (with the washer between the nut and axle to protect it). Hopefully when you back the bolt out the axle with come with it. 

If it’s polished Ti (bright silver) it’s most likely the protective clear coat finish. A picture would help confirm that. If the bike is relatively new contact Litespeed and see if they will cover it under warrantee. 

Applying greater pedaling force does put the chain under greater tension - that's how the pedaling force is transmitted to the rear sprocket and hence to the rear wheel. Perhaps when you think of tension you are thinking of something like a rubber band or spring where tension produces very visible increase in length. The individual metal chain links do in fact stretch when under pedaling tension, we just cannot see it because the amount of deformation is so small. If you take a long, flexible item such as a chain, rope or wire and put it under tension, there is in fact a force needed to push it sideways - think of a drawing back a bowstring, the greater the tension the bow puts on the string the harder it is to pull the string. A bicycle chain tensioned between sprocket and chainring is like a bowstring tensioned between the limbs of the bow, although obviously a bow string is deflected far more compared to it's length than a bicycle chain when changing gear. So, a chain under greater tension does resist a gear change more than under less tension. Modern chain, sprocket and chainring design have enabled successful gear changes under more power, but more pedaling force does still produce more difficult or noisy changes, 

I would suspect a problem in the bottom bracket, but would also check pedal spindles and bearings. Check for any movement or play between: - The pedals and crank arms - Crank arms and crank axle - Crank axle and the bottom bracket shell If there is movement between the crank arms and crank axle don't ride the bike. Alloy cranks moving on steel axles will be irreparably destroyed. Check that the pedals turn smoothly, and the crank turns smoothly in the bottom bracket. It helps a great deal if you get the chain off the rings when you make the latter check. If there is play, 'hitches', 'notchiness' or a grinding feeling when turning the pedal or crank, the bearings are wearing out / worn out. You have not said what material frame you have or what bottom bracket type you have but some press fit bearings tend to be creaky. 

I think you meant your crank is a FC-MT300. That's a triple with 104/64mm BCD, symmetrical 4 bolt and 44/32/22 rings. Any chainring that fits the 104mm BCD spider will work. The cheapest option is to just keep the middle ring (you'll just need shorter chainring bolts if you take the outer ring off.) Personally, as the 740 is only a 9 speed in the rear I would not ditch the large and small rings to make a 1x9, unless you live in a flat area or don't tackle hills and pretty much always ride on the middle ring anyway. If you are thinking of swapping the rear derailleur, cassette and shifter as well, you will almost certainly be better off selling the 740 and buying a new bike that is designed as a 1x11 or 1x10. Update: There is currently FC-MT300 and FC-M3000 cranks in Shimano's Acera range (as afar as I can tell from searching in their line up docs). Either way they both have the same BCD and bolt pattern so the advice above is good. 

Spending $30 / month at your LBS seems perfectly reasonable. Your LBS is grateful you buy from them instead of from Amazon. If you sometimes go to your bike store just to talk, that probably OK, as long as you are not distracting any staff from real work or keeping them from serving customers who are paying. Either they actually like chatting with you or are willing to humor you to keep your $30 /month, possible larger custom in the future and to maintain their reputation as a friendly, helpful store. The example you gave about putting disk brakes on a 90's Hardrock frame - yeah, they were absolutely correct about that! They were not just trying to sell you a new bike. 

Personally, I would install both levers for safety. No matter how careful you are, eventually you will get in a situation where you need to perform an emergency stop when your hands are on the tops, even if you are travelling relatively slowly. (I have experienced inattentive pedestrians stepping directly into my path only a few feet in front of me.) In an emergency stop situation you will want to brake with both wheels, and the front wheel provides more braking power than the rear. 

Some press fit bottom bracket bearings have a tendency to creak, but you may have a worn bearing. Check this answer for some info on finding worn bottom bracket or pedal bearings. I'm not sure what you mean by 'moving the right pedal backwards and forwards'. Do you mean along the axis of the pedal spindle? If one pedal has more play than the other something is likely wrong. You don't say what make or model your bike is. Many higher end clipless pedals have bearing rebuild kits available. 

Your first interpretation seems correct: you get special bike only green which allows you to position yourself at the front of traffic coming from the right on the cross street, effectively making a two stage left turn whilst staying on the right of other traffic. However, you say that when the bike only light is green, traffic coming from the left on the cross street also has a green, so that obviously does not work. It's not inconceivable that the light timing is set up incorrectly. You should contact whichever local authority deals with traffic lights and ask them investigate if the lights are functioning correctly - the situation you describe sounds like it could get a cyclist killed very easily. You can also ask them to clarify how the junction works, and perhaps request extra signage. 

I think all ceramic bearings are of the cartridge type. That means you should be able to swap out the ceramic ones for new steel ones. 

The maintenance you need to do depends on how many miles you put on the bike before it went into storage. Assuming you were riding it regularly between 2011 and it going into storage you just need to do a 'well used bike refresh' which includes replacing a number of parts that wear out. As others have said, start out by giving that poor bike a good cleaning. It was not a good idea to store it wet and dirty and that may have contributed to some of the problems you are seeing now. As part of that process thoroughly de-grease the chain, cassette, rings and rear derailleur idler wheels. There are a number of bike cleaning videos out there that make recommendations for cleaning supplies. You will need a basic tool kit: hex wrenches 2-12mm, open-end/box wrenches 6-17mm, small and medium needle-nose pliers, set small to medium flat and Philips screwdrivers. On some bikes with disc brakes a T25 torx wrench is needed. A bike-specific torque wrench is nice to have. I'd recommend at least a 2-8Nm one for small bolts. You'll have to decide if you want a larger one (up to about 15Nm) as well. There are many good instructional videos available on all aspects of repair and maintenance. I personally like Park Tool Company's YouTube channel. These will tell you the specialized tools you need, but I'll mention them below as well. Go over the bike and check for general obvious problems and loose bolts or fasteners. If you were riding the bike regularly a new chain is a certainty. You will also need to check the cassette sprockets to see of any of them are too worn, and replace the cassette if required. If you need to replace the cassette you will need a chain whip and cassette lock-ring removal tool. I believe most lock-ring tools require a 25mm wrench, a large adjustable wrench will work. You may want to invest in a chain wear tool as well. Chain rings wear more slowly than cassette sprockets but check those for excessive wear also. While you have the chain off, check the derailleur idler wheels, if they do not turn freely they will need servicing and re-lubricating, or just replace them. Also with the chain off, check the crank spins freely in the bottom bracket bearings. If it does not turn freely, but there is no roughness you may be able to service the bearings. Research the particular type of bottom bracket you have for serviceability. If there is resistance and roughness it will need to be replaced. You will need the appropriate external bearing bottom bracket removal tool for your bottom bracket. I don't know if chain quick links existed in 2011. If yours does not have one you will need a chain tool to break the chain, and to connect the new chain if you get one without a quick link. When the new chain (and if needed, cassette and rings), perform a full front and rear derailleur adjustment (Park Tool's derailleur videos are particularly comprehensive). It's more than likely that you will need to replace the derailleur cables and housing to get your shifting working correctly. It's a good idea to replace them anyway. You'll need a special cable and housing cutter. Service and adjust the brakes. I'm guessing they are mechanical disc which I don't think require special tools (someone please correct me in a comment if I'm wrong here). As with the derailleur cables the brake cables may need replacing. The same housing and cable cutter required. Check for play or roughness in the headset bearings. If there is play but no roughness you can adjust the bearing tension. If there is a gritty feel you will need to disassemble, clean and repack the bearings. Check for play or roughness in the pedal bearings. Depending on what pedals you have there may be as service kit or replacement bearings available if the bearings are worn out. Check the wheel axles for play or roughness in the bearings. Depending on the hubs the bearings may be serviceable or replaceable. You'll have to research your particular hubs. Check rims for trueness and check for loose spokes. If the wheels needs truing I recommend having a bike repair shop do it. Forks and rear shock may need re-build or servicing but that is beyond my knowledge. The various creaks you will have to individually hunt down and address. 

Riding off a curb is not necessarily going to damage the wheel or tire. I do this pretty frequently on my road bike with narrow 23mm tires with no issues. However, if you are a heavy rider, have cheap wheels, have under inflated tires or use poor technique you could run into problems. If you can feel the rim hitting the ground then definitely don't do it. Good technique is to approach reasonably slowly, stand up on the pedals and bend knees and elbows, shift you weight back onto the rear wheel as the front wheel goes over, the shift weight forward onto the front wheel as the rear wheel goes over. you can probably find some instructional YouTube videos easily. If you have been doing this for a while and there are no obvious problems with your wheels, chances are they are fine. Check that the rims are true by spinning the wheel and watching the passage of the rim near a fixed point near the rim - brake pads for instance. Check the spoke tension by pinching pairs of spokes. If the rim is untrue or you have loose spokes get a local bike shop to true them up. 

The seatpost is a fairly sturdy carbon tube, as it has to withstand the mass of the rider on one and of it and some significant bending forces. Also, the seatpost has to be clamped by the frame, so it can take some clamping force. For cleaning, you should not have to clamp the seatpost particularly hard, just enough to support the bike. I note that Simon Richardson of GCN clamps a Ridley bike on its carbon seatpost in this video. 

Modern road bikes tend to have sloping top tubes, but the 'traditional' seat-tube measurement is often made to a point level with where the top-tube meets the head-tube. Check your Merida to see if this is the case. If it is you can make a comparison between it and the Motobecane. I'd try to find out other geometry specs, especially the top tube length, which again you can compare to your Merida. 

You have addressed the pinch flat problem by running higher pressure. If you are getting repeated punctures, even with new tubes, there is probably something still in the tire that is causing the tiny holes. Finding the offending object can be difficult. I was unfortunate enough to pick up a tiny piece of steel wire (possibly a bit of paper staple) in my rear tire recently that just protruded into the tube. I had to carefully inspect both the inside and outside of the tire to find it. 

From the question I'll assume the shifter lever moves, but it does not pull the cable. My guess is that the shifter end of the cable is not seated in the shifter properly, or has become hung up somewhere. This may have happened when the cable was loose while not connected to the derailleur. 

I have a number if tubes that are over 5 years old and seem to be fine. If the bike was stored away from heat and light that will help. (Well, obviously the tubes are inside the tires and not affected directly by light.) For peace of mind you could at least buy a couple of new spare tubes. If/when you get a flat change the old one out to a new one and carry on. 

A lightly-used bike stored indoors in a dry (not humid) environment does not need much special maintenance. Just keep it clean with light lubrication on the chain. The tires will slowly lose pressure. A bike left sitting for a long time on one spot on un-inflated tires is probably not good for the tires or tubes. Keep some air pressure in the tires or hang the bike up off the floor if you can. 

On rim brake calipers the cable pulls the two sides towards each other to 'pinch' the rim. If one pad contacts the rim first it will not exert any significant force until the opposite pad contacts the rim. Centering the calipers allows the distance between the pads and rim to be minimized, thereby reducing the distance the lever has to be moved before braking force starts to be exerted. 

When you say 'on the ground' I assume you mean you are riding the bike and testing the shifting, and when the bike is off the ground you are spinning a crank with your hand. The major difference between riding and spinning the crank manually is the forces the drive train has to transmit. I.e. shifting is effected when there is significant tension on the chain. I suspect worn chain and cassette. If the bike has significant mileage check the chain stretch for elongation and the sprockets for signs of wear. I'd also check the state of the derailleur jockey wheels. 

You are confusing two different measurements. The bolt circle diameter (BCD) is the diameter of the circle the bolts that hold the chainrings lie on, not the length of the axle. In general a crank needs to be matched to the type of bottom bracket you have. There are many bottom bracket types and selecting a compatible crank is confusing. First step is to compare your new crank to the old. If the axle is shorter then the new crank is a mismatch. If the axle length is the same then there may be a spacer that needs to be removed. If you need to get a different crank you’ll need to figure out what type of bottom bracket you actually have - one for threaded shells or one of the press fit types. Adding a picture to your question will enable someone here to help. Also add the exact model of the new crank (and the old one if you know it). UPDATE: I checked the axle length on an older 105 crank I have lying about, and the shell with of the bike it came out of. The axle measurement as shown in your pic was indeed 110mm (I think it's a co-incidence that it's the same length as the BCD, apologies for to misunderstanding and miscorrecting you). My BB shell is 68mm - the common standard for road bikes. So you have a mismatched shell width and crank. This answer may help explain what's going on here. Incidentally, if you have a 'road' Hollowtech II BB for 68mm shells the inner sleeve will not be bridging the bearings which is a bad situation. I’m suspicious of the B.B. shell width given in the pic. Cube Attain is a road bike and according to the Cube website all the models have road cranks. Did you get a ‘mountain’ style BB? Those come with spacers and fit both 68 and 73mm shells. If so and you installed it with spacers the BB would be too wide.
