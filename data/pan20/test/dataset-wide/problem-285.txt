I would destroy barley (Hordeum vulgare), in the early 2nd century BC. Preferably in a dramatic and spectacular way, since I'm as malicious as I am omnipotent, but this isn't strictly necessary. During the Bronze and Iron Age, advanced civilizations (i.e. ones which developed writing) arose in four main places: Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley, India, and China. In both Mesopotamia and Egypt, barley was the most important cereal crop, and it was crucial to providing the surplus food needed to sustain civilization. Its sudden disappearance would be devastating, and while it might not cause the collapse of life as they knew it, such a crisis would certainly have a far-reaching effect. Since these early cultures formed the foundation for modern Western civilization, any significant change could affect the entire course of world history. 

You need a secret the AI doesn't know. Most "classical" cryptography, the type we use today, has no chance at all...though not for the reason you might expect. Your AI probably still won't be able to break through modern RSA, for instance, due to the sheer amount of processing power required. It would take a current supercomputer until the sun goes dark to crack it. 

However you do this, it's going to involve technology significantly beyond what we have nowadays. The best option is likely not robots but artificial uteruses. There's already significant research being invested into growing artificial organs for transplants. Once that was perfected, your future-humans started working on avoiding all the problems and complications of pregnancy and birth in space. And they invented artificial reproductive organs for that purpose. By this point, genetic engineering has also been developed far beyond what we currently have, and computer memory has continued to increase exponentially. So they could store and use the sequenced genomes of as many people from Earth as they wanted. (Which ones are chosen for reproduction brings up all sorts of ethical issues, since it can border on eugenics, so that could become a plot point.) EDIT: It's been pointed out (thanks to Mołot) that artificial uteruses do, in fact, already exist! Science marches on…of course, they're still far from ready for human reproduction, but they've been used very successfully in animal experiments. 

(Diagram taken from Gizmodo.) This is close enough to gravity on a spherical planet that our intuition for Earth can help. Let's imagine that your planet started as a sphere, with radius 3500km. This is a little over half Earth's radius, so if it's made of the same materials as the Earth, its mass will be about one-eighth Earth's. Now build up the edges. Add material around the outside of this proto-planet to turn it into a cube. You're effectively creating the most enormous mountain range ever seen. On Earth, these mountains would be 2640km high; for comparison the Kármán line (aka the upper edge of the atmosphere) is at a measly 100km. And that's just the edges. At the corners where the edges meet, the peaks would soar to 4664km above Earth's surface. The International Space Station would crash into the side, less than one-tenth of the way up. The volume of your cube-world is now significantly increased, but still less than a third of Earth's. Whatever atmosphere it has will be pooling in the middle of the faces, with the peaks in hard vacuum. With nothing protecting it, the surface would be stripped bare by direct sunlight. But could these mountains be crossed? Yes. The cubeworld's inhabitants have an enormous advantage in their "space race" that we didn't: there's a solid surface underneath them the entire way. They could create an insulated and airtight "train" of sorts, then push closer and closer to the edge, laying out more tracks with each expedition. The slope would go up to effectively 45 degrees (assuming you aim for the middle of an edge), so toothed wheels and tracks would be necessary to keep the train moving. But unlike a real mountain, the ground remains flat all the way to the edge, without any change in slope you could point out. It seems to get steeper and steeper, but in actuality you're moving in a straight line while the ground moves away beneath you. And straight lines make train tracks much easier to use. Each group of explorers could get farther and farther into the desert. Without an atmosphere, solar energy would be more efficient, and the astronomers could build their observatories effectively in space. But some people keep trying to explore farther, toward the clearly-visible end of the planet. Unlike on Earth, the horizon would actually get closer and closer as they drew near the edge. Until one day, the expedition would eventually reach the top, and look out over the edge of the world. 

The first thing to remember is how gravity would work. It wouldn't be perpendicular to the cube faces; rather, it would pull toward the center of the planet. 

If the creatures were engineered from humans, it might make sense to keep them in the genus Homo, or even within the species Homo sapiens. (Neandertals, for instance, are considered a subspecies: Homo sapiens neandertalensis.) So the name would fit the pattern Homo _____ or Homo sapiens _____. In general, scientific names are given based on either the existing Latin name for the organism (like Canis lupus) or something that makes the organism unique. (Or a person's name with -i attached, but that's a cop-out in a worldbuilding question.) Divus and angelus are good words, but they have a very religious connotation. Now, if these creatures were engineered specifically to be angelic, that might be fitting. But your scientists might prefer a more secular-sounding name. And if people in your world consider genetic engineering too close to "playing God" already, announcing that you have created "angels" is not going to help your reputation. If your angels have wings, I would suggest volucer (Latin for "winged"), since that would be a very distinctive feature shared by no other hominid. If they don't, their inability to reproduce is mentioned specifically in the question. If this is their most distinguishing feature, you could go with the fairly mundane sterilis (Latin for "sterile"), or the slightly edgier factus ("created"). My personal favorite of these is Homo volucer: scientific-sounding without being too obvious in its meaning, and in-universe the biologists could justify it easily (since they're clearly the only hominids with wings). 

It depends how X differs from nitrogen; potentially, not much changes Nitrogen in the atmosphere is effectively inert. It reacts with almost nothing, isn't used by plants or animals…for the most part, it's just sitting there, taking up space. You say X is harmless, implying that it's also pretty much inert in its gaseous form. (Oxygen, notably, is the opposite; it reacts with all sorts of things, and is incredibly toxic to any life without special protection. We have a word for oxygen reacting with organic matter in an uncontrolled way; it's called "fire".) Nitrogen, however, has some very reactive compounds (such as ammonia and ammonium). And these compounds are important for plant and animal life on Earth. Historically we've relied on bacteria for this: certain types of bacteria take gaseous nitrogen from the air and turn it into ammonium ions. Plants then take this ammonium from the soil and convert it to various other nitrogen compounds; animals get these by eating the plants. Look into the "nitrogen cycle" for more information on this. (More recently, humans have found ways to turn nitrogen into reactive compounds on our own. We then call the compounds "fertilizer" and use them on the plants.) So if X is pretty much nitrogen by a different name, your world might have different bacteria which make reactive X compounds, and plants and animals which use X partially in place of nitrogen. Not much would be different except the name. If X behaves differently, then we're going to need more information on what exactly is different about it.
