They diminish because if these are effectively practiced, the mind becomes interested in these qualities; it grabs the interest of the mind once it finds them pleasurable. As result, the mind incorporates them. They also diminish because of "incompatibility". For example, it's not possible for a mind immersed in compassion to have cruelty taking hold of it. Cruel thoughts appear distant, tasteless, sterile and weak in a mind soaked in compassion. 

@Unrul3r is correct. Because the aforementioned book is almost devoid of notes, only much later an explanation appeared. It's abhidhamma material, the context of the sentence confused me. 

Now, there's some minor controversies of wording in some suttas, related to mindfulness, which is referred to as the "the one-way path". Some people interpret it as the Buddha saying "this is a way that only leads to / directly leads to nirvana" while others might read as "this is the only way that leads to nirvana". 

In the suttas, the Buddha debated constantly with brahmins and refuted their doctrine. A prime example is ātman vs. anatta. But he also re-casted keywords and concepts used by these traditions with entirely new meanings (probably as a pedagogic strategy, and overall as a teaching principle; that is, using his audience's vocabulary to explain his doctrine). For example, kamma (translated as "action") in vedic tradition has been described as meaning "ritual" but the Buddha has redefined it as cetanā ("volition" or "intention"). namarupa (one translation is "name and form") is also an important doctrinal concept used by both traditions but with subtle distinct meanings. Similarly, with viññāṇa (trans. "consciousness"), which is considered essence of brahman (and thus, ātman), but in Buddhism, it's conditioned, subject to end. These "reuses" may not have been limited just to words. It has be argued that vedic doctrinal concepts have been used by the Buddha to teach his audience a very different doctrine using the same "stage", from fire metaphors to conditioned arising (see Gombrich's "What the Buddha Thought" book) 

Generally (and ultimately) speaking, any attachment is a source of suffering because it presupposes the object of attachment can be obtained, and if it is obtained, that it is stable and persists through time. Because we can't guarantee we can have what we want, nor we can guarantee what we "have" won't change or be separated from us, craving and attachment are ultimately bogus from the point of view of happiness. 

The buddhist sutras advert against blind faith. But there's ordinary faith: a weak type of knowledge that is useful to make a decision with partial understanding while one is still in the process of gaining knowledge. We all use this daily. So, in a sense, a buddhist go by faith in the Buddha's teaching in the same way one goes by faith in a calculus text book. One scans the summary of chapters and provisionally accepts (i.e.: believes) it is a text book that teaches calculus. Then one reads the chapters, performs the exercises, and if one comes to conclusion that one learned what that chapter is about, and if one understands that chapter to be a steeping stone in the path to understand calculus, one's faith is made stronger and one will likely continue. If otherwise one learns the contents of the chapter and comes to the conclusion these subjects won't lead to the declared goal, one's faith is made weaker, and one might end up abandoning such book. 

Anger Anger is a manifestation of one of the five hindrances, the hindrance of aversion/ill-will (byāpāda). According to the Buddha, the path to happiness and Nirvana is the path of understanding and abandoning these hindrances. 

Personally, I let many images come to my mind and imagine myself always trying to ease the burden of others, with the desire for them to be well. At this point, I don't usually focus on anyone in particular, as I find this much harder. So these images may be memories or my own imagination -- but I just imagine to the extent that it increases metta, without getting lost on imaginations. Then, there's a distinct pleasant feeling, both physical and mental, that arises from that. At that point, it's self enforcing, as it seems the mind inclines naturally towards that pleasant feeling. Then I try to expand that metta attitude until I'm completely immersed on it, as per the sutta, progressively to all directions. When I feel completely immersed on it, I abide on that all around irradiating, without focusing on any particular direction. So, effectively, I expand it until I become a loving person towards all. In other words, until I feel it becomes my reflex to help others without hesitation, whoever it may be -- so only at this point, when metta is strong, that I try to think of particular persons who I would otherwise find myself having difficulties being good towards them. 

There is a convolution of meanings for dukkha which depends on context. One translation for dukkha is "unsatisfactoriness". Of course, it is not stated there is no feeling of satisfaction or pleasure born of impermanent things, as that would be absurd. I just ate a big sandwich and I can tell you I don't feel hungry, I feel satisfied with respect to hunger. I also would be lying if I said it was a painful experience. In the introduction of the Majjhima Nikāya translation, Bhikkhu Bodhi writes: 

"On the other hand, by achieving the first four Jhanas, a person could be reborn in the Brahma realms, which I understand to be the best beings in the universe, besides the Bodhisattvas." Personal preferences aside, if we are talking about happiness, Nibbāna is declared to be supreme. A happiness and security from suffering unknown to a Brahma or Bodhisattva. Also, perhaps is not so surprising the idea of devas of superior realms desiring to be born as humans: 

"Are there resolved authorities in what is called Buddhism or is there an array of separate, respected lineages practicing different things, believing different premises, and therefore in dispute on innumerable points of knowledge and aim?" Before Gautama Buddha died, he oriented his disciples to look at the teachings (say, instead of looking for a person) and refused to appoint any kind of successor or "leader of the group". That is the "Buddhism" side. The social and historical side shows (many centuries afterwards) different groups with different important figures emerging, leaders of some sort of that particular group or just influential personalities or teachers. "Are monks and nuns more advanced than what are called lay practitioners?" Advanced in practice? Not necessarily. The monastic idea in Buddhism is for those who want to have a greater commitment, whereas dedication with lay life would not be possible or much harder. And since people have different degrees of understanding, it's natural that being monastic or lay is not, in itself, a mark of greater or lower spiritual accomplishment. IIRC, reports of advanced lay practitioners go back to the time of the Buddha. However, greater commitment and proper conditions means progress is expected to be faster -- again, that's the whole point of becoming monastic, to be dedicated full time to it. "Can we assess someone's 'Buddhist progress' by how they look, the way that they dress, speak, and behave?" Yes. Observable signs include basic traits such as honesty, kindness and harmlessness which are easier to see ordinarily. The greater the progress, the more subtle (and difficult to assess) the signs can be. "Will someone with knowledge of the Dharma necessarily have read a large number of sermons, tracts, or scriptures from known and agreed authorities" Not necessarily. Someone with full knowledge of the Dharma necessarily have perfect understanding of suffering, can directly see it's origin, it's ending and, having mastered the way to end it, ended it for good. Since, in the Buddha's dispensation, this is synonym with "Dharma". That, of course, if we understanding "Dharma" above as the principles of reality of interest. Since "Dharma" can also mean "the teachings of the Buddha" (conflated from "buddha-dharma"), in that case, one certainly has to know the recorded words of the Buddha, which are his teachings. "Are there 'solitary saints' whose innate knowledge of the Dharma is so forged as part of their being that exposure to the religion which is Buddhism was unnecessary for their role as a catalyst in waking people up?" Generally, in the Buddhist tradition, these people are known as Buddhas: those who discovered the way out of suffering without being exposed to the teachings of another Buddha. In the tradition, all Buddhas discover the same laws, so what they teach is essentially the same. The designations get a bit more detailed to distinguish between different people. For example, Gautama Buddha is referred to as a sammasambuddha: a perfectly enlightened person. This designation is reserved to those who (re)discover the dharma and decide to teach. Because of their special dedication and strivings (and mistakes along the way), they are broadly developed and have full command of the "do's and don'ts" to achieve the goal -- hence being regarded as the "best teacher". It's generally believed that no sammasambuddha arises while the teachings of a previous Buddha is known. Only when there's no trace of a previous dharma, there are conditions for someone to become a Buddha. Another designation which is related to the question is the pratyekabuddha, referring to those Buddhas who, after (re)discovering the nature of suffering and ending it, choose to live in solitude instead of teaching. 

"I think interpretations like astral body projection do not quite adhere with Buddhism." OBE, at least as documented by Dr. Waldo Vieira, is aligned with suttas describing contact with devas and super normal abilities (in particular, visits to celestial realms, etc). In other words, communication through long distances, contact with celestial beings (through the will of the human, not of the deva), etc may be explained in terms of astral projection. But in this case, it's a grey area explained by pseudo-science (*), which doesn't look very good :) 

More detailed teachings on anger from the pali canon can be found in What does Buddhism teach about anger? 

Finally, two mental factors, when fully developed, make it impossible for anger and cruelty to take over one's mind: loving kindness (mettā) and compassion (karunā): 

Depending on what one means by "passed", the stock answer is there is nothing passed from one life to another. If something passes from one life to another (be it memories, consciousness, karma, etc), than that something should be regarded as one's Self. However, the Buddha's admonished (sometimes, strongly, see MN 38) when someone say his teachings promulgate that some substance can be observed to go through rebirths. However, the Buddha also said we are heirs of our karma: 

Beings "don't exist" in the traditional sense; beings are anatta. But we are certainly alive -- we are not imagination. 

The important thing about metta is not the "object", but the result of the practice; it's point is so one becomes kind when kindness is not present. Notice that Saying benevolence (metta) is rooted in ignorance if a particular practice is described in conventional terms is like saying dhamma is rooted in ignorance because it's also exposed in conventional terms. Also, as a side note, Metta practice with a person as an object is a later development. It would be problematic if, in this or any exercise, one nurtures and develops a wrong view (e.g. believing that a person has an eternal soul). I'd guess the Ven. meant "seeing things as concepts" as something very specific: substituting reality for some concept. Conceptual thinking is largely intrinsic to thinking. it's problematic because it requires skill to not be confused, to not take something imagined as something real, to not develop wrong view (e.g believing an object is detached, eternal, subsisting without conditions). 

Well, this kind of study is what happens when any group of people is interested in answering difficult questions about ancient texts. For example, a lot of what these scholars are doing they learned from scholars of Christianity. While it may happen, any immediate disqualification based merely on what is perceived (with or without evidence) to be later texts is a matter of personal inclination. Such implicit assumption and naive inferences is, to an extent, in the eyes of the beholder -- but to another extent, it can be in the fingers of the scholar, if that is his unjustified opinion. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that one can't study history of Buddhism and, at the same time, avoid making any historical investigation or answer historical questions about that very history. 

Anger, like any hindrance, obstructs the development of the other limbs of the Eightfold Path. One example is the concentration (samadhi) limb, where it's not possible to enter the first jhana, a deeper state of meditation, without being secluded from the five hindrances: 

In the same book, Richard Shankman devotes an appendix titled "Does it matter where you watch the breath?", making further considerations. Also, Shaila Catherine, in her Focused and Fearless, seems to teach that step as focusing on the breath "as an object", rather than focusing on the specific sensation of in and out breath. Its hard to say from what lineage she got this, as she trained with monks from many different schools (maybe Ven. Pa-Auk Sayadaw?). Ajahn Brahm, also wrote on this matter: 

So, by means of intention that "you" or "your mind" starts an act to affect "actual" reality. And, in the words of the Buddha, how does actual reality affects "you" or "your mind"? 

The same goes for speculations about the world, universe, existence, in the past or future. These speculative views can be challenging when our imaginations are given wings to fly wild, and when we are sensitive to the places it takes us. But they are just that: imaginations. For a buddhist, one thing that might be useful here is to revisit the teachings on Right View (and on Wrong View, such as above). These may help prevent the mind from wandering on thoughts that are unhelpful and only disturb it (again, that's an important point here: the thoughts and imaginations are the cause of disturbance and fear, not the reality itself. For example, your body and mind are likely fine and possibly comfortable while imagination trips away and disturbs everything). When imagination is getting in the way, the one "place" one should go is to the experiences of here and now: that which is felt and perceived with the senses as they occur. It might be useful also to look for comfortable and pleasing places, since irritable or painful situations can only increase the anxiety caused by these imaginations and fears, feeding them once more. When the mind is pleased, it feels no need to look out there for answers to fill voids. Then, one can direct the mind inwards, and inwards it will go. In other words, with Right View in place and a mind that is not distracted, it can be more easily brought to unity:
