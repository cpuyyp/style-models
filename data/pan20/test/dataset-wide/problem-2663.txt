There's is no short-cut: you must climb the Tree of Knowledge and see from that standpoint (or not). Philosophy can help, as it is nominally about Truth. You'll probably have to get a degree to have a seat on that perch. But the real quick path in lieu of that is to ditch books and dive headfirst into every challenge that is creating problems in the world. You'll eventually probably get stuck at the point between God and Science and get lost as everyone else. At that point, contact this author or go on a bigger adventure. 

I think the real point for libertarians, and something they probably haven't taken the time to voice, is simple: they simply don't feel part of the government, so they don't feel they should be taxed by it. Now that's a weak position, on their part in my opinion, but nearly every American has the same fault: very few people understand the purpose and potential of the U.S. Constitution and very few people have lived up to either their own responsibility for maintaining these principles, or have simply have not understood it enough to attain competency. So in the absence of any competency, a person rightly will feel resistance to paying taxes. But then, it's philosophically lame for them to proceed to pay taxes, when they shouldn't be afraid of their own government. 

The only "evidence" is by induction. The Law of the Eternal states that anything that can exist, will, given eternity. Posit: YHVH is the continuously-emanating singularity that we know as the Big Bang. As it is a singularity, it, perforce, incorporates other gods or demi-gods encountered within the Hebrew calendar (including the Christian one). Couple this with the actual first-hand reports and observation from the Jewish Orthodoxy, then you have sufficient evidence by induction. 

Good question. Maybe if Kant would had access to our knowledge today would he would update his thought. He was a genius, no doubt. It seems to me that noumena [(in the sense they are the (supposed/.../presumed) things themselves, which we in lack of better concept so far, we say: reality] impose certain constraints to life which has got thinking ability and life with thinking ability responds to such constraints with a set of heuristics which moral/ethics/.../"what works" are examples and maybe are just byproducts of thinking ability. So, in the end if we eliminate free will we have to start to find another heuristic to deal with it and moral & cia are not enough for it. Now, with AI (artificial intelligence, which I prefer to name artificial integration) we just lost ANOTHER degree of freedom... so it is about time to think about the reduction of freedom implies in terms of the "next" heuristic... After all we are just algorithms producing biochemistry and bio-electrical signs. See for example the book of the picture... ☺ 

Philosophy is a tool. It is a good tool. If the tool is used properly it will benefit our daily lives. If we do not use it properly it will not benefit. Philosophy used properly: .. An illiterate and handicap mother in Africa which just lost her youngest child due to malaria... An western person who is familiar with philosophy OR not and finds a way to support organizations who are capable to reach those who are struggling. Philosophy is about DOING good! Philosophy not used properly: .. Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem quoting Immanuel Kant to justify his terrible works. The picture tries to illustrate how philosophy can help the person to navigate from a war contributor to a peace contributor... 

: I don't know how to fulfill this question (request) until you tell me (to be specifically) what your request is. IT ASSERTS "REQUEST SYNCHRONIZING" OR 

Freedom within Dependence upon Something Escape But since mostly we are dependence to something else, then in general, we are within boundaries. Free is an escape. Escape from what? Free is an escape from dependence to something. But if we can escape from dependence to something then we have to stay within another boundary. If that so, then where is our freedom? Is freedom an escape from all boundaries? Surely no! 

Generally philosophy must help us to see something to the farthest extent that we can possibly achieve gradually by deepening the knowledge from any fields and to see where something to be placed on, so we can be guided to achieve something at best gradually. Philosophy stands on any fields of knowledge to further deepening knowledge with the purpose to be able to see where ourselves should be placed correctly. Science must be supporter for philosophy to be working properly, and vice versa. To be more specific: 

If we make a comparison to human. Human having abilities to do as animals and plants did but with wider ranges. It puts human as being with higher consciousness. Compared to zombies, since zombies have abilities as already described, then zombie must be considered having new consciousness differently to previous consciousness (whether it might be considered from subconscious or being possessed). Final (Advanced & Limited) Justification 

The problem is, when we are treating a proposition to semantic level, there will be paradox, contradiction or ambiguous. But if we consider a proposition, a statement must be related to reality, then hope we can understand something clearly and lead away from confusion, as a start to put something at the correct placement to avoid confusion. 

Any system of logic is based on unprovable axioms -- that's just the nature of the axiom. However, that doesn't make every possible starting point equal. There is a history to the universe. You could say that is the a priori from which one could make an actual foundation for mathematics as well as spirituality. What I can tell you from my own personal investigations is that math is interesting because it`s basic axioms derive from the entire history of consciousness in relation to the universe. Now I can't prove this to you in this forum except to tell you that because of this, physics and math tend to abide. But consider the axioms neither beliefs nor assumptions, but agreements between GOD and us (perhaps that's why the symbol for "equals" is two parallel lines of equal length). 

Personally (and this is an uncommon position), I believe the Wars stemmed from deep, and poorly misunderstood disagreements between the Christian interpretation of the Jesus and the Jewish one. That's one part of it. The other part is the Christian position that America and all the land discovered since the Columbus was theirs via Manifest Destiny. The mistreatment of the Natives, sanctioned by the Pope under requirimiento, allowed them to kill the people found here shamelessly. Since the bloodlines of the Natives was not rooted in the Judeo-Christian bloodlines, Japan, their biological relative, simply attacked in unconscious defense, a sort of genetic reaction of a people who otherwise had no hope whatsoever of ever claiming America as their territory. 

The problem of your question is the idea of "nothing". What is nothing? Is it some black blankness? Where does that come from? Is it absolute 0? From whence does this order come from? The only answer to your question is to posit a Quantum Sea of Unknowability. It is neither nothing nor any particular thing. Consider it like heat or Hiesenberg's Uncertainty. Or, you can view it like S in physics describing Boltzmann's Entropy where S = k log W, where W is the number of states, in the case of the universe is probably something like infinity, but you also don't know the base of the log, and k (the Boltzmann constant) is a bias in present science in favor of the atomic model of matter. So, in the end, you can't actually quantify it. Get it? 

Good question. SUV is a car but we call it SUV assuming that is a car. Enlightenment is a religion but we call it Enlightenment assuming that religion is detached from Enlightenment. It seems it is not possible for our little brains to split religion AND something such as science, capitalism, communism, clubism, statism, enlightenment and so for... things emerge from other things... As Max Planck put it "For religion, God is at the beginning; for science, God is at the end." See more, for example, in God Is a Person Reflections of Two Nobel Laureates. Religion is embedded everywhere. ☺ It seems to me The Analyst, by George Berkeley, 1734 was a superior exercise to make sense of things which worried him then. It was so good that even today we revisit it. Read, please, the text of the image the way it is presented and then read it replacing "I" by "Religion" ☺ 

Maybe this help: [Definition: A necessary condition for some state of affairs S is a condition that must be satisfied in order for S to obtain.] [Definition: A sufficient condition for some state of affairs S is a condition that, if satisfied, guarantees that S obtains.] From here. It has got examples and a tests. ☺ 

By multi-meaning-messages I mean the capability of the people to convey communication with different significance (sometimes even opposite) to different target audiences/constituencies AND such information co-habit. It could be considered lie but due to status of the emitter is not handled as such. The emitter of the message is aware of it and use it as a tool to expand/keep its influence for example. Most of the receivers are not aware of it. I had been noticing that philosophy plays an important role for effectiveness on absorption of the messages by different targets. Examples 1: [As Lewandowsky says about the billionaires supporting rightwing populism: “Theirs are very personal motives and probably not the motives these people will admit to themselves. There are very few people who say, ‘I’m greedy and I like being greedy.’ Instead they will say, ‘I’m a libertarian and I believe that society is best served if free individuals pursue their own interests.’”] $URL$ Example 2: When persons use the term "democracy" they might mean "democratism". Example 3: When persons use the terms "Nation:State" they might mean "Oligarchy:Corporation". The picture tries to capture that sometimes the multi-meaning-messages can run very deep and does not spread fast... 

Liar Paradox An example of the use of dependency of proposition can be implemented to analyze this issue, a liar paradox. Liar paradox, "He is telling the truth that He is lying, therefore He is not lying." Syllogism 

These questions can be answered by understanding that: animals, wall, and any object within reach as far as interaction with us, have certain consequences relevantly. 

Third understanding: Dream realm is something less real than another realm (that may be considered as real as it should be). Regarding to this understanding, the question may be interpreted as "How does one know one is not placed on environment that less real than what it should be"? 

(ONLY IF) (there is the need) (Stating a Bi-Conditional in plain English), then, (there MUST BE) (there is implementing a Bi-Conditional using "OnlyIF-Must") 

The point is: The moral behind this is, that understanding the facts about physical state must put our effort on two different states (physical state and immaterial state) to balance our life, to balance our possibilities, to make us better human, to make us aware that there is another state that can be considered as real as it can help us to improve our life. To make us realize that we have choices as big (or even bigger) as we ever did on physical state. 

"Perceive to be" is a process, and "perceive that" indicates there is a fixed target (that) to be perceived (focused, to be felt). The points are: 

(ONLY IF) (there is implementing a Bi-Conditional using "OnlyIF-Must"), then (there MUST BE) (there is the need, indication) (Stating a Bi-Conditional in plain English) 

Discussing about moral (based on religion or ethics generally) are rather broad, but at least there is one thing we can hold on. It's not about "moral act has to be necessarily beautiful" or more and more ... . But at least moral act or ethics (to the specific extent) as far as we can try to accomplish, that we must "do not hurt yourself and do not harm anything involved with us" as good as we can do it. There are number of definitions, categories for something to be considered "do not hurt yourself and do not harm anything involved with us". But the point is, this philosophy ("do not hurt yourself and do not harm anything involved with us") may be a start for us to ignite our creativity or to inspire our acts to do properly (whatever standard we use). Perhaps doing so, somehow we can put our acts in line with harmony and perhaps it looks like beautiful. It's not about telling that goodness is not beautiful, or it's not about telling that moral acts has no relation with "has to be necessarily beautiful", but it's about placing our starting point at correct placement, and further the beauty on our acts will follow later, i hope :) .
