I have a Devinci Caribou and I just weighed it at 23 pounds, or 10.45kg with the rear rack, lights, and 2 bottle cages attached. I'm not sure how accurate my measurement is as I just used my bathroom scale, but I weighed it by weighing myself, and then fully lifting the bike off the floor and calculating the difference. The bike I linked to is likely a little lighter as it's a newer model with better components. They used to have 2 models with the one I own being lower spec than the one shown. Being aluminum, it's likely a little lighter than many touring bikes which are made of steel, but it still has touring geometry. Here's a link to a PDF brochure from 2006 which gives a weight of 11.1 kg. I would assume it's gotten a little lighter since then, so the weight I measured seems somewhat accurate 

I also would recommend finding tubes with valves of the correct length. However, if that fails, I've had success using a presta to schrader adapter. Often with shorter valves, there won't be enough room to attach a pump head, but there will be enough to attach an adapter, which you can then use a pump that works with schrader valves. Most pumps have the ability to do both now. I'm not sure if this will work in your situation, since you say you have 50mm rims and 42mm valves which to me would mean that there would be no part of the valve protruding from the rim. 

If this all sounds like gibberish to you, bring the bike into your local bike store and they can help you out on exactly which parts you will need to replace. 

For on the road, I use the Topeak Road Morph G. This pump has a hose, so it doesn't required that you hold the valve. It has a little tab that pulls out that you step on with your foot. You can pump up a tire using one hand (and one foot) with this pump. You have a free hand to hold the wheel if you feel the need to hold the wheel while pumping. You can also use your free hand to hold the bike upright if you are just topping up the tire, and don't have something to lean the bike against and you don't want to lay the bike down on the ground. The Lezyne Micro Floor Drive pump also works similarly and might also be a good choice, but it's not as easily mountable on the bike in my opinion. 

Not familiar with sturmey archers, but on regular gear/brake cables you can just cut off that small top near the bottom of the picture. It's really just there to keep the cable from fraying and you can get replacements from your local bike store for about $0.02. If you grip it with a pair of pliers and pull hard enough you can sometimes just pull them off so the cable doesn't get shortened. I'm not sure how would remove the "adjusting part" or if it would just slide off when you removed the tip off the same end. 

You can get spacers to move the pedal further from the crank. Combine these with some larger pedals and you should be OK. Probable worth seeing a bike fit specialist in your situation though. 

I know people who use speakers like this. They work well, and don't fall off the bike. You can hook up your existing MP3 player using the headphone jack. If you do that, the controls on speaker don't work. Or you can plug in a USB key and play mp3 files off there, and in this case the controls on the speaker work fine. 

I've been using a Presta valve in my front schrader rim since I picked up tubes last, because they were out of schraders in my rim size. Haven't had any problems yet, knock on wood. 

Deal Extreme has a large selection of bicycle clothing. I haven't bought any myself, but I am seriously considering it given the low price. The reviews on the items seem to be quite favorable. 

There's a couple different factors to consider. First of all, the 8 speed setup is going to use a chain with wider plates. This means that assuming both chains are of equal quality, the 8 speed chain will last longer because it's made of more material. Another thing to look at is the amount of cross chaining. Cross chaining occurs when then two sprockets don't like up in a straight line between the front and the back, see the picture below. A 1x11 setup will in practice undergo more cross chaining than the 3x8 setup because there's only a single ring at the front that has to accommodate all the rear gears. With the 3x8 setup, althought more extreme cross chaining is possible, in practice the rider shouldn't be using these extreme gears too often anyway. A 1x11 drive train is much more likely to be in a more extreme chain angle. 

This bike looks similar and utilizes an engine in the front hub. You won't get as much range as you would on a bicycle, but there's lots of room for extra batteries on a tricycle. The bike in the link states it gets 30 miles on a charge, and can reach speeds of 25 mph, which is pretty impressive. 

I think that the LBS works a lot like most other shops. They don't make a lot selling you a whole bike, but they sell accessories with a much bigger margin. When I bought my bike, they didn't take anything off the price of the bike. But they gave me a good discount on all the accessories I bought along with it (helmet, lock, lights, free water bottle and cage, etc.). Try to shop around and see what other retailers are selling the same/similar bikes for. 

The product you are looking for is interrupter levers. regular flat bar brake levers aren't designed to work in conjunction with STI levers. The ones I linked to specifically say they are compatible with caliper/cantilever brakes. I'm pretty sure most interrupter levers would be compatible with caliper/cantilever brakes because v-brakes don't tend to be found on bike with drop bars, which is where one would normally need interrupter levers. 

Shimano Shifters aren't compatible with SRAM derailleurs, so you have to get a travel adapter to alter to the cable pull. Jtek Engineering makes a bunch of different travel adapters. You should contact them to see if they have a solution. I clicked around on a few of the travel adapters, but I couldn't be sure which one would for sure solve you problem. The Shiftmate 6 looks like it might work as it says it's used for 9 speed shimano shifters with a SRAM 1:1 derailleur and a shimano/SRAM 9 speed cassette. SRAM lists a bunch of different derailleurs that use the 1:1 technology. 

There are two versions of the 2400 series, 2x8 and 3x8. The 3x8 version is usually labelled as 2403, but if the amazon description says that it is 3x8, then that specific product is probably the 3x8 version. Based on the reviews and description, this appears to be the 3x8 version. 

If you don't want to spend any money, just take it slowly at first to ensure that the brakes and steering are working properly. Try twisting the bars while holding the front wheel between your legs to make sure the bars don't turn with a decent amount of force. Ensure that the wheels spin freely and don't rub on anything. It's ok if they wobble a bit on such an old bike, but if there is excessive wheel wobble you might want to have a professional look at it. Alternatively, you can take it in to your local bike shop for a tune up and safety check. Looks like a single speed with a coaster brake so there really isn't much to go wrong or adjust but you might be best off having a professional take a look at it and making sure things are in working order. 

I would personally go for the 1x8 over the IGH for a couple reasons. The first is initial cost. 3 speed hub is going to cost more than a single 8 speed hub. Also, it makes changing tires a lot easier. Changing the tire on an internal hub can be quite daunting for somebody who's never done it before. Internal hubs are more durable, but there are precautions you can take with deraileurs such as getting a guard shown below to ensure that they are protected if the person leans the bike down on it's side. 

Putting disc brakes on a bike that wasn't designed for them (which a comfort bike most likely is not) would be quite expensive and quite difficult. First, your frame has to have the mounting brackets for disc brakes. For the front you can get a new fork. For the back you'd have to have one welded on, and even in that case it might not be a good solution as the frame wasn't designed to have one there. Then you have to have wheels with hubs that are compatible with a disc rotor. By the time you get around to getting all this done, you've probably spent close to as much as your bike is worth, if not more. As far as fixing your current situation, what might help is getting higher quality caliper brakes. I would think that the brakes on a $500 bike might be a little sub par. New/better brakes should not be that expensive and should be able to be fit on the bike quite easily, at minimal cost to you. Good quality caliper brakes do not exhibit any of the problems you describe and should stay tuned for quite few miles. Also, you should expect that your tires deflate a little after a few days. This is normal. Get a good pump and get in the habit of topping them up every few days. As long as they aren't leaking extremely fast, such as down to almost nothing in a couple days, you're ok. Dropping 5-10 psi in a few days isn't out of the ordinary. 

If you at the Sheldon Brown tire width chart, you can see that there's only 1 width listed where 23 and 32 are recommended. On that page, he says using too narrow a tire can result in pinch flats and rim damage. If you think about the extreme case, where the width of the rim is almost as wide as the tire flattened out, then you wouldn't have much cushion between the rim and the road. What is your reason for wanting to go with such a narrow tire? Wider tires are more comfortable and offend have less rolling resistance. the advantages of narrow tires are lighter weight, and more aerodynamic. however, the aerodynamics only matter at very high speeds, and a good quality 32 mm tire won't be that much heavier than a 23mm one. If you want to go a little narrower, you should probably try 28 or 25 at a minimum. A lot of racers are using 25 mm tires now. 

32 teeth should be enough to clear the frame. Even using a 30 Tooth (pictured below) there is still plenty of frame clearance. That's a different frame, but still, it looks like there would be plenty of room on any frame. 

Personally, I just try to take up the whole lane when in the roundabouts, so drivers don't have any reason to think that I'm exiting when I'm not. However, the roundabouts that I traverse on are almost completely devoid of traffic. I think some motorists might get angry with a bike taking up a whole lane (not that they should). Anyway, the rules in my country/province state that you're only supposed to signal (to the right, we drive on the right) when you are exiting, not to signal left when turning left around the roundabout. It's funny that I just did that naturally, but the link I posted also states that you should merge into traffic and take up the lane so cars don't pass you. Bikes can travel about as fast as cars in roundabouts anyway due to increase cornering capabilities. 

I have a CycleOps fluid 2, and I'm assuming yours works similarly since they are both fluid trainers. Fluid trainers don't have adjustable resistance. If you want the resistance to be harder, shift the bike into a harder gear. The resistance will increase as your wheel spins faster. It looks like your bike has a 46 front chaining and an 11 tooth sprocket in the back as your hardest gear. This should be plenty of resistance, again, assuming it has similar resistance to my trainer. I usually have mine on the middle chain ring on the front which in my case is 42 teeth. I don't usually make it anywhere close to the smaller cogs. 

Sounds like from that site that it's pretty much not even possible to get it working. Best option might be to sell your old calipers and get some new ones or see if anybody in your area is looking for a trade. 

At the level of bike you are looking at (2010 Trek 7.5 FX), most of the components will be easily found at your local bike shop or online. At this level, most manufacturers will use standard components which are easily obtainable, mostly because using any non-standard components would end up costing more, as they would only be produced in low quantities. Also, because they use standard components, and many other bikes use the same components, there is a big market for replacement parts, which means that finding replacement parts should be easy and inexpensive. Assuming the used bike is in good condition, you shouldn't be worried about being able to find replacement parts when the time comes. As you move up to more exotic/expensive bikes, you'll start to see more unique parts that may be harder or more expensive to replace on older models.
