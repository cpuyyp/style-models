You can get relatively high metallicity rather quickly in parts of the early universe -- especially some globular clusters and the centers of massive galaxies -- because star formation rates in those places were very high, which means lots of massive stars and several rounds of "massive stars form, go supernova and seed surrounding gas with metals, new massive stars form out of enriched gas" -- the timescale from formation to supernova can be as short as 2 million years for really massive stars. So how high a metallicity do you need to form planets, and how early did (parts of) the universe get there? 

Finally, there is an issue unrelated to the AO itself, which is that you need different science instruments depending on whether you're working in the optical or the near-IR. Optical instruments use silicon CCDs for detection; these are only sensitive out to about 0.9-1 microns. Near-IR instruments use different detectors (usually HgCdTe-based), which are good from about 1-3 microns. (Near-IR instrument also need a different design to reduce contamination from thermal emission from the telescope and optics for observations at wavelengths longer than 2 microns.) So in practice the choice has been: combine AO with a near-IR instrument and get good performance with affordable/feasible technology, or combine AO with an optical instrument and get very limited performance with more expensive (or even, until recently, unattainable) technology. Nonetheless, there are some optical AO systems starting to appear, such as MagAO on the Magellan telescope (which has both an optical instrument and a near-IR instrument, and can correct for both simultaneously). 

The smaller isoplanatic angle, as you note. This limits how much of the sky you can observe with AO, since your target needs to be within the isoplanatic angle of a bright enough references star. (Even with laser guide stars, there is still a need for a reference star for "tip/tilt" correction.) The difference in angular area on the sky means that the area of the sky that can theoretically be observed with AO will be about 20 times larger in the near-IR than in the optical, just from the difference in isoplanatic angle. The effects of turbulence are stronger and have shorter timescales in the optical. This has three effects: A. The corrective optics (e.g., deformable mirror) need to have more movable parts ("a near-perfect correction for an observation done in visible light (0.6 microns) with an 8-m telescope would require ~ 6400 actuators, whereas a similar performance at 2 microns needs only 250 actuators.") and need to operate on a faster timescale. B. In addition to the electromechanical complexity, you'll have to do far more in the way of calculations to drive all those actuators, and on a shorter timescale. So the computing power required goes up. C. In order to provide the inputs for the corrective computations, you need to observe the reference star on a much finer angular scale ("A large number of actuators requires a similarly large number of subapertures in the wavefront sensor, which means that for correction in the visible, the reference star should be ~ 25 times brighter than to correct in the infrared."). This limits how much of the sky you can do AO for even more: a star that might be bright enough in the near-IR to correct a region 20-30 arcsec wide isoplanatic patch won't be bright enough to correct the corresponding 5-arcsec-wide isoplanatic patch in the visible. In order to make corrections, you need to observe the reference object in the optical. This is easy to do with a near-IR setup using an optical/IR beamsplitter: send the optical light to the AO equipment and send the near-IR light to the near-IR instrument. In the optical, you use an optical beamsplitter to send half the light to the instrument and the the other half to the AO equipment. This means that the AO equipment only gets half the light it would if it were used with a near-IR instrument, which makes it (even) harder to do the corrections. 

Of the three known medieval supernovae (in 1006, 1054, and 1181 AD), only SN 1006 was definitely recorded by Europeans, and even then, was only discussed in any detail in a single European source (the annals of the monastery of St. Gall in Switzerland). Although there are multiple accounts (some quite detailed) of the supernova of 1006 in Arabic/Islamic records, there is only one known Arabic record of SN 1054, and none for SN 1181. Since SN 1006 was by far the brightest of the three, the simplest explanation would be that SN 1054 was, like SN 1181, just not bright enough or long-lasting enough to merit sufficent widespread commentary in Europe. (Remember that China in the 11th Century was a much more advanced society than Europe of the same time, with a dedicated tradition of government-supported astronomical/astrological observations.) 

Although it's a little tricky to say what "bigger" means in this context, the answer is, in most senses, no. A supernova puts out about ten to a hundred times as much energy in the form of light, and hundred or more times as much matter is ejected. (A core-collapse supernova undoubtedly puts out much more energy in the form of neutrinos as well.) What matter is ejected by a kilonova does go out faster (30-60,000 km/s, versus about 10,000 km/s for supernova ejecta). On the other hand, a kilonova puts out much more energy in the form of gravitational waves, so they're bigger in that sense. 

You could use phot_g_mean_mag (apparent magnitude), but you would have to assume an absolute magnitude for each star or galaxy you were interested in. From the data in that table, there's no way to do that. (Some of the matched tables might give you a starting point: e.g., if you decided that Gaia source X was matched by SDSS source Y, then you could track down the SDSS measurements, which might let you decide what kind of star it was and thus guess at its absolute magnitude.) 

Here's a crude way of estimating the answers: The density of stars in the Milky Way disk decreases exponentially as you go out in radius and also exponentially as you go out in height above/below the disk midplane. The corresponding scale lengths are about 3 kpc (3 kiloparsecs = about 10,000 ly) radially and about 300 parsecs (about 1,000 ly) vertically ("scale height"); this means that if you go out in radius by about 10,000 ly, or up/down in height by about 1,000 ly, the density decreases by a factor of e (2.718...). Changing radius by about one tenth of the scale length or less, or changing height by about one tenth of the scale height or less, only changes the local density by about 10%, which isn't enough to worry about. That corresponds to about 300 parsecs (1000 ly) in radius, or about 100 ly in height. So the for case of a 100-ly radius, you can assume the density everywhere is about the same as the local density suggested by the table you linked to. That density is 60 stars / ($(4/3) \, \pi \, 16.3^3$) = 0.0033 stars per cubic ly. For a sphere of radius 100 ly, you would then expect about 14,000 stars. Naively, a sphere with a radius of 1000 ly would then have about 14 million stars. But a sphere that big extends above and below the disk midplane enough so that it samples about 1 scale height. So you can't just re-use the local density. Without getting into the proper approach of integrating the density functions in 3D, we can make a crude estimate as follows: If we used the density at one scale height (1/e times the local density), then the sphere would have only about 4.5 million stars. If we split the difference, that's about 10 million stars, which is probably not too terribly wrong. (I've been ignoring things like stars belonging to the "thick disk" and stars belonging to the halo, but they won't contribute a whole lot; also, the Sun isn't exactly at the disk midplane, but about 60 or 70 ly above it...) 

The American Meteor Society FAQ page notes that about 95% of observed meteors are probably of cometary origin. But they're apparently so fragile that they're only about 1/3 of observed fireballs, and 0% of known meteorites. Also, since the Earth passes through streams of cometary debris several times a year, and yet there's been only one plausible mass extinction due to cometary or asteroid impact in the last few hundred million years (the one that did in the dinosaurs), it appears to be extremely unlikely for cometary debris to be a meaningful danger. 

The Roche limit for a solar-mass (or 10-solar-mass) black hole is much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, or even the last stable orbit (which is a few times the Schwarzschild radius). So the Roche radius is a good limit (and, yes, you're right about the limit for an Earth-like planet and a 10-solar-mass BH.) You needn't assume the BH has an accretion disk; I suspect most of the ones wandering around in our galaxy don't at the moment, just because accretion disks accrete (go into the black hole) over time, and so you only see them when there's some relatively recent source of gas to create the disk. (Most of the Milky Way black holes we know about are in close binaries, where the companion star is close to the Roche limit and is a regular source of gas.) Now, in principle the stellar wind(s) from the star(s) in your system could contribute to a very weak, tenuous accretion disk, but in practice it's unlikely to produce enough radiation to be of any concern, especially as you're assuming a planet with an atmosphere. So there's no need to worry about whether or not the planet is tidally locked to the black hole, unless you want to specify the length of the day-night period. Of course, if the planet is only a few tenths of an AU away from the BH, it probably will be tidally locked before very long. The variation in distance from the star(s) you suggest should be fine in "habitable zone" terms. In fact, given that the planet orbits the BH quite rapidly (about 1.3 days for a 0.05 AU orbit around a 10 solar-mass BH), it won't spend much time at either extreme, so you could probably have it go inside and outside of the formal habitable zone and still be habitable, as long as the average insolation is in the habitable range. This would create some interesting day/night/seasonal effects, particularly in the tidally locked case: e.g., at a certain time of "year", the "eastern" hemisphere would experience noon when the stars were only 1.95 AU away, while for the "western" hemisphere noon would happen when the stars were 2.05 AU away. Half a year later, the situation would be reversed. One last curiosity: assuming the black hole has an "average" spin, would it be realistic if the two Stars had a tilted orbit with respect to the black hole spinning axis? That really depends on how the system formed in the first place. If the initial pre-BH star and the other star(s) formed from the same collapsing cloud, they would probably have similar spin and orbital angular momenta; if the spin of the BH is entirely inherited from its progenitor (which goes supernova to form the BH), then the orbital plane might be similar to the BH's spin. But if the system got put together later (maybe an encounter between a binary consisting of the BH and another star and the current binary pair, in which the BH's original companion star gets ejected), then the two stars could have a tilted orbit.
