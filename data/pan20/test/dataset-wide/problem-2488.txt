Nelly Nelly on FB; U meditate after u gain Sovan; First u see & try grasping the world as Impermenance (Anithya), Dukka, Anaathma (Soulless); Sunaatha, Dhaareetha, Charaatha.. Are you aware of these 3 components of learning? The Buddhist way of Learning (absorption) is NOTONLY listening/Reading. Sunatha means - listening, Dhareetha means to carry and charatha means to -carry forward (practice what you've learnt. Of course listening is the most important and everytime you listen to dhamma you willgather little bits of information you could carry forward in practice; Read the Tripitaka ten or as much, take a brush and tooth brush of daily applying the theory of Anithya, dukka, Anathma; As u sweep the house, cooks, for every ur daily chores, u should mindful and aware as u perform and then sunatha, daretha, charatha Hon -As u get a good grip of ur true nature / reality, u will get ur stage advanced to Samma Dhitti (Right view); Sovan; Then u start meditation, coz how u try to emerge something already not in ur stream or u r not accustomed of; First u need to enter the stream then the meditaion would flow in u, obvious enough effortlessly; Theruwan Saranayi; with all due respect sir, this is what I ve learnt recently Thank you 

It was interesting to note Thich Nhat Hanh’s take on the word MUDITA. Now you have given further interpretation to the Satara Brahma Vihara: Metta (loving kindness), Karuna (compassion), Muditha (altruistic joy) and Upeksha (equanimity). In this reply I will give another third interpretation to the Satara Brahma Vihara, that will help you gain immeasurable results from these, yet making it practical and within reach to those who would put it to practice. An interesting point that we should be mindful about is the fact that those beings in the Brahma worlds have perfected the four Brahmavihara: metta, karuna, mudita, upekkha. They don’t have a trace of hateful thoughts, yet they never developed the ultimate wisdom, or panna. They have ignorance (moha), and thus will one day be reborn in the four lower realms, (unless they attain Sotapanna stage before that). Whereas we in the Dhamma Path have but one goal of walking in this Noble Eightfold Path. Only this Path will lead to Nibbana where one purifies the mind of all defilements. The loving kindness meditation (metta bhavana) that you and I have been practicing give a meaning like this: “May myself and all beings be free of suffering, healthy, happy, and be free of all suffering”. Contemplating this way helps make your own mind to calm down, and makes you think about the welfare of the other beings. If we could truly feel the possible suffering of the countless being out there [beings in the lowest four realms (apayas)], this very meditation gives a much more deeper meaning. Even the beings in the higher realms can end up in the apayas (lowest four realms) unless the Sotapanna stage is reached. A disciple attains the Sotapanna (stream entrant) stage of Nibbana with the understanding of anicca, dukkha, anatta. At the Sakadagami stage one becomes free of all physical ailments and diseases and will only be born in the heavens. At the Anagami stage, one removes more akusala citta becomes permanently free of any physical suffering. With this understanding when in metta meditation you say “be healthy”, it takes a added deeper meaning. By that what you would mean is to not be born ever with a body that is subject to diseases and old age. All four of the Brahma vihara (metta, karuna, mudita, upekkha) can be cultivated simultaneously if you contemplate on this deeper level. That is to reflect thus: “May myself and all living beings attain the Stream Entrant stage and be free from suffering in the four lower realms forever” “May myself and all living beings attain the Once Returner stage and be healthy forever”. “May myself and all living beings attain the Non Returner stage and attain peaceful happiness forever”. “May myself and all living beings attain the Arahant stage and be free from all suffering and attain the full Nibbanic bliss”. What is important is not how you say it, but what you feel within your heart. To be in oneness with such thoughts you need to understand anicca, dukkha, anatta in its truest sense. A niramisa sukha starts to set in if you keep practicing this way. 

Nelly Nelly on FB - Rebirth take place right after, no wait ; its called Gandabba: It begins right after ur death in either 31 planes of existence ; If u are to get a dogs birth (succeeding for) Hon, u have that copycat of a dogs frame now: This stage is not solid though hence no food at this very stage; Its only a copy cat of what u have accustomed as a human; U have dog traits, ur Bardo is right after ur human death of that Red chain now to a Blue chain; U cling just like that to the new blue chain now; But u still have not found a womb though; u are here till u get that dogs womb or find that pertinent dog mother; So, now u are a dog bardo; if u are going to be a bird, ur red chain of human disconnect right after ur death and cling to the blue chain of the bird bardo ; Make note, no solid body due to no food or soliditary till she gets the birds mother; But she waits in her dog or bird gandabba till she gets her pertinent womb; If she is going to get a human birth again, then she gets a human bardo till the right karma clicks with her and provide her of the mothers womb pertinent of what she been accustomed in human life ; Now this is a LIFE here ; This life is what goes to a womb; So the birth or what we concieve is already a LIFE; So u get it now, the Gandabba is a LIFE and its ur new BIRTH: IF u wont score for a mothers womb or even a pet, u could be here for trillion eaons now: There is no intermediate stage though, its a LIFE ; U die, u REBIRTH as a Gandabba: let me know, is this enough ; Thank you
