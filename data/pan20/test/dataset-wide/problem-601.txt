Chris King components are crazy expensive, and they often require special tools (also crazy expensive). It might be cheaper to buy a new frame and a regular hub. If your frame is steel, you should be able to manhandle a 135mm hub in there. If it's aluminum or carbon, I wouldn't recommend that. 

-- EDIT -- This is the tool I have. And this is the tool I'm supposed to have. The splines may have fit, except the diameter is off by 0.6 mm, which sounds like just enough to make it incompatible. So I guess the answer's no. Damn Campagnolo, always making things harder... 

This is a Thule trunk-mounted rack. Typically used on sedans, but it also works on some (not all) hatchbacks and wagons. If you can mount one of these so that the top bar rests on the edge of the hatch, not on the glass, then it should work. But this might be a problem with your Focus - it has a sort of visor at the top of the rear window, right? That part is probably not designed to bear weight, so it wouldn't hold up at all. I'd look into roof-mounted racks if I were you. 

Rust on the frame will be the least of your worries. By the time a frame shows significant rust, all the moving parts will be completely unusable. Check if the rims are true. On a lot of old bikes, the wheels are crooked as hell. Lift the bike, spin the wheel, and watch the space between the rim and a brake pad. A little wobble is fine, but if it's more than a few millimeters, it's probably beyond fixing. Bearings: hubs, bottom bracket, pedals, headset. Do they spin freely? Is there any play? Do they make noise? Check the condition of the chain. You're probably thinking: "a chain is easy to replace, what do I care if it's a little rusty?" Well, if it's so easy, then why didn't the previous owner do it? It's an indication that all the other stuff wasn't maintained either. Brakes. Are the pads worn down? Do they move freely when you squeeze the lever? Are the pads rubbing on the tires (if so, replace the tires immediately!) Tires. Check for worn tread, also check for dry and cracking rubber. 

I can't give you a direct answer, because I have no idea what they mean by "two piece axle" either. Here's what I do know: 

Is it worth it? Hell yeah. Especially for wet or muddy conditions. Is it possible on your bike? Probably not. Unless you get new wheels, a new frame and a new fork. In which case you might as well buy a new bike. 

Frame rust is the least of your problems. It's the rust on your moving parts that you should worry about. I've never actually seen a frame on a working bike fail due to rust - the chain and the bearings will seize long before it gets to that stage. So, in order of priority: 

If you have to put the saddle all the way down, the frame is too small large. You need to have a comfortable clearance between the top tube and your crotch when your feet are flat on the ground - especially on an off-road bike, since you'll often have to dismount in a hurry. There are other aspects to getting a proper fit, but this is something you can't get around. Also, if you're on the short end of things, I wouldn't recommend a 29er. They do make them in small sizes, but in order to get a smaller rider into a reasonable riding position between those two big wheels, they have to make some compromises with the geometry. You'd be better off with 26" or 27.5" wheels. 

Generally, V brakes have much better stopping power than calipers. And I'm guessing that your frame will require calipers with a pretty long reach, which makes it even worse. Forget about caliper brakes - concentrate on making your existing brakes work better. First thing you should do is to check if anything's malfunctioning: are the cables sliding freely? Are any of the moving parts binding? Are the pads contacting the rim squarely? Next step is to upgrade the brake pads. If you do switch, then yes, you'll need new levers. Caliper and cantilever brakes: short pull, V brakes: long pull. 

You can try one of these. I got one at an antique junk shop for 5 bucks. You'll definitely get people's attention. 

If there's little stand-over space, then the frame doesn't fit you, and there's nothing you can do except get a new frame. Either get one with a shorter seat tube, or get a "compact" design with a sloping top tube. You can just stop reading here, but I'll answer your other points just because. You can move the seat back, or get a longer stem, or get handlebars that put your hands further forward. The fork you have is not the one that originally came with the frame, is it? The original fork probably had a higher rake, which would put the wheel further forward. Toe overlap is something you can learn to live with, though. As long as the tires aren't rubbing, there's no problem. If there's very little clearance, you just have to pay close attention to it, and make sure your wheels are true. Or get skinnier tires. 

Since you have vertical dropouts, you'll need some sort of chain tensioner. You can buy one, or you can use the existing rear derailleur. You'll have to rig it up somehow so it stays in the same position (that is, so it's always lined up with the sprocket). I strongly suggest reading Sheldon Brown's article on single-speed conversions. 

If you're replacing the whole crankset and BB, then any 9-speed double crankset should work. The chain width for 9-speed systems is the same for all makes (not the case for 10 or 11 speed). But before you do that, I'd look around and see if you can replace just the left arm. Any crank designed for the Shimano "outboard bearing" BB should work (those are the ones that clamp onto the BB spindle with two pinch bolts). Just make sure the crank arm is the same length. 

Very interesting question. When two spokes are touching, then they're pulling against each other. They're like two adjacent links in a chain; when the chain is under load, both the links are subject to the same amount. So this might help spread the load better; but I have no idea if this effect is actually significant, since as you said, radial wheels work just as well. 

The most affordable clothes are the ones you already own. So start with those. Your legs will be moving a lot, so pick something that doesn't restrict leg movement. Shorts are the way to go, unless it's below freezing. If you're a man, wear snug-fitting briefs to keep your family jewels tucked up and out of the way. For shoes, ideally you want something with stiff soles that doesn't restrict your ankles (like low-top hikers), but really, any comfortable shoes will work. If you do this for a while, eventually you'll figure out which parts of your wardrobe are lacking - and then you can start looking for cycling-specific items. 

Take a look at Sheldon's entry for "bottom bracket"; it lists several different types, but most of them you'll never see. Most bikes made today use the "British" BB shells. You might also see a few of the one-piece cranks (especially on older BMX and dept-store bikes), but this design is becoming obsolete. So if you get a donor bike that doesn't have a one-piece crank, then you should be able to find a compatible BB at any place that sells bike parts. 

It's rare for a manufacturer to have different wheel sizes for the same model, but it does happen sometimes. Fortunately, it's easy to check the wheel size, it's always printed or embossed somewhere on the tires. Yours will probably say 700c or 622mm or 28 inch - these are all equivalent. One other thing you'll have to consider is the rear dropout spacing. If you can't find the manufacturer specs, you'll have to measure it. Most road bikes use 130 mm, and most track bikes use 120 mm, I have no idea what yours is. (The front dropouts are almost certainly 100 mm).
