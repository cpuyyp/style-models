Since you mention "infant" in the question, the most relevant systematic review I was able to find, is "Effectiveness of treatments for infantile colic: systematic review" BMJ 1998;316:1563 This evaluates 27 clinical trials, and among the conclusions are: 

The Paul Hardcastle single 19 contains many samples from the 1982 ABC TV documentary Vietnam Requiem - and the statement that the average age of a Vietnam "combat soldier" was 19, is one of those samples. We can assume that the ABC journalists sourced the claim somewhere - but where? I was able to find the same claim elsewhere, with a claimed source. The New Jersey State Council of the Vietnam Veterans of America repeats the claim in their Vietnam War Statistics page. They also repeat the claim that the average age of a WWII soldier was 26. Their stated source for the claim is: 

The phenomenon is known as "TV Pickup". It's a sufficiently large effect that "pumped storage" reservoirs are built, which can deliver over 1GW to the grid at a few seconds' notice, used in conjunction with other direct generation sources, which are slower to ramp-up, but can generate for longer. Even on a typical evening, spikes of around 800MW can be expected - during the ad breaks for the big soaps, for example. Among the largest recorded in the UK is 2.8GW following an England/Germany penalty shootout in 1990. Whole teams are dedicated to both predicting the demand fluctuations based on historic form, and actively monitoring the live system. From the horse's mouth, these slides from a presentation by a National Grid operational energy manager. 

The questioner expressed a particular interest in bipolar disorder, and deaths by natural causes as opposed to suicide. Table 3 reviews research that shows bipolar disorder has a reduced life expectancy between 8.5 and 13 years. The discussion mentions that people with bipolar disorder commit suicide at more than 10 times the rate of the general population, but they don't break down the reduced life expectancy by suicide vs not suicide. 

This document published by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) appears to be the source of the 2015 murder numbers in the image. It gives names, pictures and details of 21 trans people murdered in 2015. They do not give details on how they found or verified these names. On page 27 it discusses how the FBI's data collection methods undercount anti-trans violence. The FBI tables for 2015 list 1 trans person murdered. The HRC report says of the FBI's numbers. 

The Washington post article accurately summarizes the findings of a real scientific paper. The paper was published in a respected journal and presumably passed peer review. The paper reviews a lot of other scientific literature that comes to the same general conclusion; In general, heterosexual women like muscular men. However there is some room for nuance. There are competing explanations for why, and various explanations of exactly which muscular men women like. 

There wasn't initially a problem with the Oxygen being released as the quantity of Iron on earth reacted with the Oxygen forming Fe2+ and Fe3+ compounds first. Only once all the available Iron had reacted with Oxygen did the Oxygen start building up in the atmosphere, but the rate of Oxygen production from all the Cyanobacteria on the planet by that stage was rather large. There evidence for this is oxidised Iron compounds appearing sometime after the evolution of cyanobacteria, and pre-dating the free oxygen in the atmosphere which is given in the article you linked to. If you want to do a rough estimate, this paper claims 25 Giga tons of carbon from CO2 are fixed each year. This is 2.1e+12 moles of Carbon, which should then liberate the same number of moles of O2. The atmosphere contains 5.1480×1018 kg , of which Oxygen makes up 21% by volume, or 23% by weight. So 1.6e+20 moles of Oxygen. The ratio then means that it would take approximately 7,600,000 years for the current rate of production of Oxygen to take the atmosphere from 0% Oxygen to the current 21% Oxygen. This is consistent with the ~50 million years proposed for the timing from Oxygen starting to build up in the atmosphere to the Great Oxygenation Event 

The science on this topic is somewhat inconclusive. The latest Cochrane review of all of the research on the subject concludes that the evidence is not strong enough to merit widespread use, but there are probably some benefits including weight gain. 

Although this is not directly relevant to the claim we can use this paper counting method to look at trend in the number of papers published over time. I repeated the count for every year between 1999 and 2016 and found a steady increase in the number of papers over time. 

They report that they are going to use better scientific methods to look for more evidence, but the dangers of fires are holding them back. 

The data this claim seems to be based on is severely limited. I applaud their efforts to bring attention to this issue, but they do not appear to be using scientific counting methods, and their data only goes back a few years. 

Your question appears to correctly restate the claims of the paper. According to their paper, flying produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions per passenger kilometer traveled (PKT) than driving. A large aircraft produces roughly 125 grams of CO2 equivalent per PKT; A sedan produces roughly 230. The conclusions of the paper depend on assumptions they made in their methods. They chose to evaluate 747s and 2005 Toyota Camrys. They also chose data about average passenger occupancy for both of these vehicles. I cannot find in their paper exactly what this data said about the average number of passengers in a car. Although these assumptions are a potential weakness in their study, all studies make assumptions. Without simplifying assumptions, you can never get anything done. 

This shows that not only did humans evolve in response to milk consumption, but the cattle evolved to better produce that milk, as cows were under selective pressure from human preferences. 

Yes, there are drugs which boost the immune system. TGN1412 is an example where this was an unexpected side-effect. The results were catastrophic for the people involved. Boosting the immune system in healthy people is generally not a good idea! 

Given that Dundee voted Yes to independence and their representative claims there was no impropriety with the counting, I find it implausible that the vote there was rigged in favour of voting No! I don't know where the first image you have is from though. 

No, that video was made as a publicity stunt by a shoe manufacturer to promote their water-proof shoes. $URL$ is a video they later uploaded revealing how they made the video, using hidden platforms below the water. You can, however, run on water if you add some cornflour into the water, resulting in a non-Newtonian fluid. There are several videos of this around on the internet. (EG $URL$ 

And this was confirmed in landmark experiment in 2011 published in Science. Here a worm (C. elegans.) which normally reproduced both sexually and asexually was modified to isolate a strain which only reproduces sexually, and one which only reproduces asexually. They then infected the worms with a bacterial parasite (S. marcescens) which can proved lethal within 24hours if the worm is not resistant. Both the worm and the bacteria can evolve resistance/virulence over time. In this experiment the sexually reproducing worms had a much lower mortality than the asexually reproducing species when infected with the bacteria. This effect was much greater after being co-cultured with the bacteria for 10 generations, where ~70% of the asexual worms died while only ~18% of the sexually reproducing worms died after 30 generations. The asexually reproducing lines all went extinct after 20 generations. 

This is a handbook produced by the VVA, as a resource for its members. Several other sources refute the claim, based on the average age of soldiers killed in action. I'm not sure that it's reasonable to assume that deaths were evenly distributed among ages. 

It should be noted that "infant colic" refers to babies crying, or showing symptoms of distress, for no discernible reason -- since they can't talk, we don't know where their pain is. It could be a headache, in which case gut treatments aren't going to help. In adults, Holtmann, G., Gschossmann, J., Mayr, P. and Talley, N. J. (2002), A randomized placebo-controlled trial of simethicone and cisapride for the treatment of patients with functional dyspepsia. Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 16: 1641–1648. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2036.2002.01322.x ... concludes: 

This study is funded by Asche AG, and you have asked for studies "not funded by the vendor". Drugs.com (credible with good onward referencing) states that simethicone is effective for flatulence, functional gastric bloating, and postoperative gas pain; "not recommended" for infant colic, and that its efficacy has not been demonstrated for intestinal distress and "immediate post-prandial upper abdominal distress". So my conclusion is that simethicone is effective at relieving trapped gas in the adult gut, but that trapped gas in the gut is not typically the cause of baby colic. 

So 1 million deaths per year from coal air pollution. Nuclear power provides ~6% of the worlds energy, and so over 20 years over a million lives will be saved. This seems to make the claim in the original paper seem feasible. Other forms of energy are also compared for total deaths per TwH: 

So in summary, airbags are beneficial to adults, but the USA airbags are dangerous for children, who should not ride in the passenger seat. 

This is because DMSO travels straight through your skin, and drags with it dissolved toxins such as cyanide: 

So it seems the risks depend on which type of airbag you have. In the USA the risks seem to outweigh the benefits for children, but not adults: 

This blog post has a detailed analysis of the deaths from various forms of energy. It would seem to agree with the result of a large number of deaths saved from the use of nuclear energy. For just air pollution it says: 

In this Nature Genetics paper, Gene-culture coevolution between cattle milk protein genes and human lactase genes Nature Genetics 35, 311 - 313 (2003), the variants in Cattle milk proteins and Human lactase persistence genes were analysed. (Lactase persistence means that adults can keep digesting lactose, while normally the lactase gene switches off after childhood, giving rise to lactose intolerance.) They found that: 

This is a new paper published in a peer reviewed journal. It will take time before it garners the positive or negative citations that are the real peer review. In the mean time, our best option is to rely on non-expert opinion to judge the quality of this evidence. The research that you have already done about the claim seems like half of an answer already. To summarize the main points: 

Is this a real theory real scientists take seriously? This perspective letter published in a scientific journal reviews 3 explanations for the phenomenon. The third explanation matches the one given in the episode. A perspective letter is more like an opinion piece than a in depth scientific investigation. They typically go through an abbreviated peer review. 

This government report presents data on felony defendants in America's 75 largest counties. These counties contain large cities accounting for 37% of the total population, and are not nationally representative. In 2009 in the 75 largest urban counties there were 412 felony rape defendants, of which 68% were convicted of something, 57% (235) were convicted of a felony, the rest a misdemeanor. The infographic claims that of the 11 cases referred to a prosecutor, 7 of them will result in a felony conviction. The two sources have a similar felony conviction rate; The difference could be explained by rounding errors in the 7 and 11 or it could be that RAINN took the average of several years of data.

This medical article has an excellent summary of the benefits and dangers of airbag use in the EU and USA. 

This means that the effects of a USA vs EU airbag is quite different. The US airbags will save the life of an unbelted adult, but can cause injuries in the process, especially to children. 

So yes, we do know at least one reason why sex has evolved; coping with parasites. As with all evolutionary rationalisation, this may not be the initial reason or the most important reason it evolved. 

In this paper: Human papillomavirus is a necessary cause of invasive cervical cancer worldwide the authors analysed samples which had previously tested negative for HPV with more advanced methods and found them positive, raising the rate (of HPV in cervical cancers) from 93% to 99.7%. They state in the abstract that: 

Yes, in chemistry labs Cyanide dissolved in DMSO is referred to as "Liquid Death". As this in depth explanation states: 

This means that nearly all cervical cancer cells contain HPV DNA. I don't know if any studies have been done to infect animals with an HPV equivalent to see if they develop cervical cancer. But a correlation of 100% is pretty compelling evidence by itself.
