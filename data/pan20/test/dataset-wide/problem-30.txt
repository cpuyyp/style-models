Many of the answers preceding mine focus on the idea of the present definition of a word. We have no present reason to consider a different definition. There are no other species (including dolphins, sorry) that rank as our intellectual equals that we might consider a tasty food source. In other words, the assertion that you can't be a cannibal unless you're eating a human is short-sighted because the idea has never been tested otherwise. Fastforward to the future (I'll avoid fantasy for now) where we meet the Ambrosians. They achieved intersteller flight before we did. Their children can speak dozens of languages as a matter of course. Their discourses on philosophy are so insightful that it's been known to bring humans to tears. Their music enjoys renown throughout the galaxy. And they're mighty tasty with garlic. Though I haven't performed the research to prove otherwise, I wouldn't be surprised to discover that the idea of cannibalism is abhorent because the thought of eating your mistress is just so wrong. I mean, she not only can complain, but she has the right to complain. Taking her life is a violation of our highest law and her dearest civil right — eating her would be adding insult to injury. But would we transfer that concept of an inherent right to life to another intelligent species? We have (to a limited degree) with lower species on mother Earth. Organizations like PETA exist for this very purpose. Most of us don't care because (a) the animal can't complain, (b) the animal has no intrinsic rights (from our point of view), and (c) pretty much every protein is good with either ketchup or BBQ sauce. But when the creature can lucidly beg for mercy before the slaughter. When his or her cousin can sue before the law for redress. When his or her nation can pull their ambassadors and stage an invasion fleet outside the orbit of Mars.... I'm going to say yes, the definition of cannibalism would be quickly broadened to include every sentient creature. I believe this concept would include sentient fantasy creatures and would be regardless procreative compatiblity. Given enough time for the concept to settle in the human psyche, it would lead one to even feel sick over the idea of consuming the dead in an emergency. But that wouldn't stop some from doing it to stay alive. 

If I remember my high school biology correctly, generally speaking, the female sex drive peaks during the period of potential conception (aka, "periodic") where men basically have the same drive all the time. To males who don't understand this, it appears that women simply have less of a sex drive than men. Note, however, that this is 100% biological. Outlying cases (e.g., your somewhat insensitive reference to nymphomaniac women and impotent males... you do know that both mean AND women can become addicted to sex or suffer impotency, right?) are irrelevant to the question. What I don't understand is why you want to focus only on this. How would society be different if the female sex drive were constant and the male sex drive periodic? To begin with you'd have to justify that in your story, and since the drive is 100% connected with the reproductive cycle, you kinda can't and leave everything the same as you suggested in your question. Finally, note that the Star Trek NG episode "Angel One" dealt with the idea of gender role reversal (the women were generally taller, more muscular, and more aggressive, the men smaller, weaker, and more docile). Maybe you want to check that out. 

They're cheap. All you need is a barge and you don't need to feed horses or maintain the river (other than docks). They may move faster than a horse-drawn carriage. Barges can haul much more than horse-drawn carriages. 

There will always be a reason to use a cheaper alternative Science may provide opportunities, but the universe is driven by economics. Consider our ploddingly slow adoption of solar power. In my area, the local power utility has been increasing rates for solar users almost exponentially because they're losing money to solar and the cost of the infrastructure (which solar users still depend on) remains the same. Consequence: lots of people not using solar. The simple reality is that fission (lower tech) will always be cheaper than fusion (higher tech) and there will always be people who will, for whatever reasons, want to save that proverbial buck. Show me an advanced, fusion-driven glowing cityscape that people the universe-over drool over and I'll show you the very same city eight blocks away where everything from drugs to people are sold — and it'll all be run using cheap fission "they-can't-find-me-through-my-power-bill" reactors. 

Yes and No: it depends on whether the land is considered Terra Nullius or not Terra Nullius is a latin phrase that describes land that is not clearly claimed by a sovereign nation. You've described a condition that could lead to a declaration of terra nullius for the purpose of re-establishing control (and, theoretically, peace) in the region. If A and B were both somewhat stable, the land would not be terra nullius as the land has a legitimate claim from A and an illegitimate take-over by B. But, you've described A as falling into chaos. It's that chaos that would need a legal team to determine if the region is terra nullius. If determined to be so (B no longer makes claim and A doesn't exist to assert claim), then, theoretically, a nation could step in and simply lay claim to the territory. However, that tends not to happen. Who wants territory that's (a) unstable and (b) a long way from home and therefore difficult to control? If it isn't terra nullis, then the UN is the best bet Now, to be frank, what you've described is a perfect example of why UN peacekeepers exist. The theoretical purpose of the peacekeepers is to NOT get involved with the politics, but to stabilize the region so the politics can be diplomatically reasserted. The peacekeepers (among other things) were created to avoid the trouble when one sovereign nation steps in to solve another sovereign nation's problems — because that tends to look a lot like a military takeover. The peacekeepers are meant to be neutral. Which one is best for you? That depends on your story, of course. What do you want to have happen to A? How much diplomatic shennanigans to you want to take place? etc. 

Yet more immaterial are various forms of radiation. But now we're not starting with a physical object. We're starting with an energy object. Star Trek solved this problem with matter transporters that shifted physical matter to energy then back again. To suggest that our understanding of matter teleportation is growing is a bit like saying we know what the inside of a house looks like when we're standing outside the city boundary. Never mind the philisophical implications of what amounts to copying the original, sending the pattern somewhere, and 3-D printing it out again, destroying the original so that nobody gets confused. The problem is, because you're not starting with matter, you can't just slow down the vibration and poof! you have a material object. What you actually have is a particle of radiation at a lower energy state. If I remember my physics correctly, if you slow down the vibration enough, the particle simply evaporates. Because it was never material to begin with. 

I can easily assume that as X approaches infinity habitability approaches 100%. Further, I can assume that as Y approaches zero, habitability approaches 100%. It's the space in between that I'm having trouble understanding. 

Frankly, from the perspective of communication (which I'm assuming due to your desire for a sentient species), the tongue is absolutely unnecessary. HOWEVER Communcation is not the original purpose for the tongue. At least in humans, "the tongue is vital for chewing and swallowing food...." I wouldn't be surprised if that basic statement was true for every species that has a tongue. It's a useful critter that makes moving food around in your mouth very easy. And spitting. It's great for spitting. So, knowing that you don't need a tongue for communication, but it's a pain in the wazoo to move food around in your mouth without it. The real question is, how does your species eat? 

You haven't explained why your benevolent god is doing what he does. And without knowing his divine purpose, we're left with the paradox of how an omnipotent, omnipresent god can allow something to transpire that he obviously wouldn't want to happen. So, let's give your god a purpose, a reason for his association with the people that transends protecting them like babies throughout the eons. 

The following does not account for culture. Dwarves like the underground and may care little about the advantages of surface transport. Nevertheless, all other things being equal: Rivers 

You're asking us to explain whether or not something no one has yet proven to exist can do something that only some physicists think it can do. What answer are you expecting? Physicists can show you how the mathematics supports the possibility of time travel. However, it depends on cutting-edge concepts like the Casimir effect that we're only just beginning to understand. Just because the math supports it, doesn't make it so. Just because we've found a bit of evidence that suggests the possibility, doesn't make it so. 

WWII proved that you can create a world-wide conflict without nuclear weapons. A cold war means the chess pieces of the world have been positioned to create a condition chess players call Zugzwang, meaning the only way to win a war is to not be the first person to move. Therefore, the balance of power would be created by:
