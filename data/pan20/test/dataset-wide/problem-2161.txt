They don't know the code on Github is yours. They can't compare that code to the code of the other candidates. Sometimes more important than the end result is how you get there. What questions you ask, how you solve problems, etc. 

This is a tricky situation. You got lucky: you and the employer both decided (independently) that it wasn't going to be a good match for you. But the reasons for that are completely different. Here's the key difference. Your reason was because the job wasn't a good fit for your particular career path. Their reason was implying that you are not a good employee. I personally disagree with their logic here. Specifically, having the fortitude to decline to answer an interviewer's question shows you have more confidence than the average interviewer, not a lack of confidence as they seem to indicate. So it's easy to logically say they are simply wrong in their assessment. What they should have said was "we didn't like that you didn't disclose your salary information, so we cut you loose" because that's what it seems like. So we can all agree, these guys are jerks and we should forget them. But... 

Many large companies have generic postings for different teams. For example there might be a web team, a mobile team, an internal apps team and a dev ops team. For entry level positions they're mostly going to be the same. Some coding, some scripting, CS degree helpful, etc. Also, many shops have hundreds of developers. So, even with low turnover rates they're always looking for new candidates. And some are always willing to pay to keep the door open to rockstars when they come through. It's unlikely that they've been holding out for 10 months trying to find the right person to fill their team. They're most likely casting a large, wide net. 

Laconic: none. Relieving letter fraud doesn't occur frequently enough to warrant any special measures. Moreover, once the new employer updates the relieving letter in the records, it is rarely brought up again. The more prevalent problem is experience certificate fraud, wherein candidates submit fake experience certificates to claim more experience or experience with a different skill set than what they actually have. If or when that is discovered, it is dealt with according to company-specific policy. 

As neither of these seems to have happened, you can assume that they do not think the others are doing nothing. 

This sounds like a fantastic idea for team bonding ... except that it will work differently from what you expect. To make it more effective, choose an activity that costs an exorbitant amount but nobody likes, make it mandatory and do it after work hours. This would ensure that the team members are either so annoyed that they leave on their own, or so demotivated that their work suffers and they would be fired. Then you can hire a brand new team which you can build from scratch. In addition, depending on what the team thinks of the boss now, the team bonding event can produce great results in a different way. If the team members already hate the boss individually in secret, the team bonding event may cause the hate to spill over and encourage team members to bitch about praise the boss publicly. Nothing unites a team better than praising the boss. 

There's no universally accepted time frame to apply for internal transfer. Check your company policy on the minimum time period that an employee should spend in their current role before they become eligible for internal transfer. If there's no such policy, the acceptable time frame would depend on many factors, such as how long you can tolerate being in your current role and how soon your current manager can let you leave. Nonetheless, before going for internal transfer, you should discuss your issues with your manager and see how you can work together to resolve them, or at least make them less undesirable. No job will be perfect, and you would need to deal with a lot of undesirable situations (and people) if you want to go far in your career. Jumping at the first instance of a problem wouldn't help you much. 

I had the same condition on employment once. I completed my course work and even walked in the ceremony but there was some paperwork that needed to be done somewhere. Not on my end, but still it meant when I walked I got a blank diploma in the folio. To this day, I have still never actually received my degree. It's been 7 years. And no one has ever been like "hey corsiKa, you don't have a piece of paper on your wall. Did you really get your degree?!" Yes, of course I did. And the paper is really meaningless anyway - if someone truly wants to hold your feet to the fire, they'll send for an authorized transcript with your current status. As professionals, we tend to take people at their word for common things like that unless and until it becomes apparent that it might not actually be true. 

There is a good business reason for it. Companies that engage in illegal activities do so because it makes them money. People who whistleblow threaten to stop those activities and thus cost the company money. Also, complaints leave paper trails for auditors to find, which is dangerous. Employees who cost the company money in any capacity need to be identified and removed. It is possible this firm in the past had a bunch of malicious reporting that was completely bogus. Obviously investigations cost money and if you're investigating over nothing just for political points, that's costly. But this seems unlikely. The most likely reason is they're an unethical company trying to cover up unethical behaviors with more unethical behaviors. 

Questions about your notice period and other job offers are not trick questions. These are standard questions companies ask to obtain information essential for their decision on your candidature. You don't need to get worried or think too much about it. Just state the facts, like so: 

I would strongly recommend that you avoid hiding your employment (as your post strongly suggests you want to do), especially if you already have the relieving letter. It keeps life simple and avoids a lot of potential future problems. If you still go ahead with your clever plan, be prepared to provide a convincing reason in case someone finds out and asks. Be aware that you could be found out several years later, not just in the near future. While a 3-month stint left out of a resume is not a huge problem by itself, you should be wary of the perception it leaves. ("I wonder why he had to hide his first job. Did he do something seriously bad there, and doesn't want anyone to find out?") Background verification at this point is unlikely to cause you any problems because for an entry level job, nobody will ask "Let us find out if he has worked anywhere else during this 3-month break". You can expect to be asked in the interview about the 3-month gap between your graduation and the application, but there are enough freshers who would truthfully answer "I was searching for a job", so you won't raise any brows there.1 Now, moving on to the question on Gratuity: you don't need to worry, because you are not eligible to receive it. Gratuity is only paid to an employee who completes 5 years of employment in a single stretch. Finally, about the PF (Provident Fund), there are a number of points you need to be aware of: 

So keeping those philosophies in mind, we have unlimited work from home days. If you have client meetings, obviously you need to be in the office for those. If your manager feels you're abusing the work from home policy (or sick policy, which is also unlimited,) they will talk with you about it. Because we hired quality people, we know if someone ever did have to have a talk, it would be resolved, or the manager would simply revoke the ability of that employee to work from home. But honestly, if someone isn't pulling their weight, it isn't just because they're working from home. There's bound to be many other factors leading up to such a discussion. On a side note, if you're moving into a new managerial role and start removing perks, you're likely to get a lot of resistance. 

I think you should draw a distinction between requesting different interviewers and requesting additional interviewers. You mentioned that your current interviewers are "executives" - are we talking like VP level and C level executives? Because that seems very odd. If it is the case then either your company is very small and they do all the hiring, or someone is going to groom you for a high level management position. If on the other hand you said executive but really meant HR representative, then that's a little different. When I'm going for an in person interview, I insist that the hiring manager be there. I insist that the person who will be responsible for my workload, performance review, and day to day management is present during the interview. The one time I deviated from this rule, I hated my entire tenure at the firm and I won't do it again. However, I would never ask that someone -not- be there. That is definitely rude and also makes it look like you don't play well with others which is not a trait you'd like exposed in the interview process. So if you would like to request that the hiring manager be present so he can make an evaluation, that is a reasonable request. I've made it (politely) and had it be met with warm reception. It's especially relevant when considering that you are responsible for asking them questions and making a decision too. How can you make an informed decision about whether you want to work there if you can't interact with the person who knows more about what you're going to be doing than anyone else? Now this is strictly for an in-person interview. If this was another phone screen that wouldn't matter so much. You might get stuck with many rounds of phone interviews before you get to an in person interview and you aren't really in a position to make such a request there. 

1 On a somewhat metaish note, this statement is quite similar to the explanation used with one of the close reasons on this site. 

No, you should never intentionally hide information that the recruiter would use to make a hiring decision. It only serves to ruin your reputation with the company, which is not an ideal start to your job. Disclosing your true joining date after receiving the offer means that they need to go through the paperwork again (along with all the process that precedes it), and they also need to revisit their project planning to see if/how they can accommodate your delayed joining date. A good rule of thumb (or toe?) which usually works is to put the boot on the other foot. Suppose you accept the job offer and sign the agreement, and then they disclose that they have to delay your joining date by 4 months, you wouldn't be too happy with it, would you? 

Your boss has told you to follow the HR's times. What you should do cannot get any more clear than that. You mention that you find it difficult to be on time every day. You would either have to figure out a way to make it possible to be on time each day, or deal with the consequences of not being on time. This company clearly considers it important for employees to be in office at specific times of the day. They do not regard the employee being in office at other times as sufficient compensation, even if the total number of hours worked is more than the required hours. While we can debate to our hearts' content whether such a policy is good or bad, none of that is relevant to your problem. If you want to continue working at this company, you will have to follow the company's policies. 

You might be overthinking this. Both people with the power to act have delegated that power to you. They trust you and your judgement, so leverage that. Let's suppose for a moment that you had the power to enact the things you don't feel you can. If you did that, you surely would go into the meeting with this employee with a plan and a few very likely outcomes. Continue to draw up that basic workflow and have a review meeting with both of managers in question. If they agree with the workflow, and you receive (in writing) authority to implement your plan to get the employee back on track, have your meeting with her and present it. If they don't both agree to it, there it's on them to find the solution going forward. They dumped the problem on you to solve and you solved it. If they don't hold up their end of the bargain when they dumped it on you, they need to clean up their mess. They are the managers after all. That's their job. 

In most cases, let it slide entirely in that it never needs to be brought up. If the presentation is being given to peers, but is likely going to go 'up the ladder', make notes and give them (with other constructive feedback) after the presentation. Obviously, balance the urgency of that feedback with the expected presentation to higher management. You should only point it out in the meeting if there is imminent confusion as a result of the typo. For example, chemical names can often differ by a single character, and adding the wrong chemical to a formula could be costly, illegal and dangerous. Sales figures change dramatically by adding or removing a zero, or fat fingering a 1 into a 4. If a stock price is given as $104.32 a share when it's really $104.21, let it go. If the stock price is given as $104 a share when it's really $1.04 a share, bring it up. Just like any other correction, question, or any diversion or interruption in a meeting, you need to ask yourself if the benefit of interrupting outweighs the cost. You wouldn't interrupt a meeting to tell your buddy your thoughts on the game last night, would you? Well, in most cases, doing that and doing what you describe contribute exactly the same to the meeting you're attending: zero positive contribution and precious seconds/minutes of peoples' time. 

It always makes sense ... for the labor lawyer. It never makes sense for you to hire a labor lawyer to keep your job. If you have been accused of fraud or some other major offense, it makes sense to hire a labor lawyer to clear your name (and not to keep your job.) In all other cases, you always lose by hiring a labor lawyer. Even if you win and get to keep your job, you will still get treated as a social outcast, which means you will probably end up leaving the job soon anyway. (And no, you cannot sue them again to force them to treat you normally.) Regardless of the outcome of the case, you lose a lot of your effort and "life energy" fighting the case, not to mention lawyer fees and court fees. (Some courts may order the company to reimburse you those fees if you win, but that also means you may have to pay their fees if you lose.) Moreover, you are up against an entity which likely keeps multiple lawyers on their payroll, so the odds are usually stacked against you. That doesn't mean you can never win, of course. However, unless you feel that strongly about the issue, my advice would be to let it go and spend your efforts, "life energy" and money looking for a better job. Remember life is short, don't waste it fighting unnecessary battles. One who runs away from a fight lives to run another day. :-) 

If the company is okay paying the desired salary you write, they will agree to it. If they are not okay, they will negotiate anyway, so appending negotiable doesn't add anything. Quote a desired salary slightly higher than your "real" desired salary, so that they feel like they have been "successful" in negotiating it down while you get what you want. If you quote too high, they may put you out of the reckoning entirely. If you quote exactly your desired salary, you may end up with a less than desired offer, especially if they have some silly internal policy that every offer must be negotiated downwards and/or the HR person's bonus is tied to the amount negotiated down.
