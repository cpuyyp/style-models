Wrong reasoning. If you train on your own at work hours (intensively, full-time for several weeks!), you won't do your daily job, and your immediate boss cannot assess if you are actually learning stuff useful for your company. BTW, you are also creating a precedent in your team (and other people could ask to do likewise). Of course, if you accept some training, you also accept to have your job evolving to profit from the skills acquired in that training..... Your boss is... 

I think that the main problem is that the other team leader has refused to acknowledge a problem or participate in solution-finding on this issue. If another try at working with him fails, try reaching out to the other team members directly. They're probably mostly reasonable humans who recognize and want to solve the milk problem. 

Yes - generally, historically, male workers in Japan are expected to work very long hours. Female workers, less so. But your exact scenario may vary. If you're considering a major move for work, you owe it to yourself to do some serious due diligence in considering the offer. You really should talk to the company and your future boss about: 

(fits nicely in my prediction, so not a big deal for your company's perspective) In that case, do the training and don't tell about your willing to change job (until you found a new job, signed a new contract, and are resigning). Details could matter, e.g. perhaps the German law forbids to quit after such a training for a specified amount of time (learn more about that) 

The business will see you as trying to make things work, but perhaps a 2 day trip just doesn't make sense for them expense-wise. Don't be too specific about what the commitments are - it's really none of work's business - but do re-frame the request in a way that would work for you. At the same time, take first steps towards a job search. Spend an hour every other night or so polishing up your LinkedIn profile and resume. Be sure to add recent work projects and whatever it is at your current position that makes you so indispensable. Be sure your current boss understands what works for you with regards to travel (and salary) so they are not blind-sided if you make a change. 

That is a very excessive reaction. However, for some interviews (not all of them) you might tell that you don't have time to follow them, because you have more urgent tasks. At last, there might be issues you are not aware of. Perhaps the job market is difficult for hiring companies, and the company prefer to hire someone now instead of looking for some better candidate during several months. Or perhaps they don't have the budget (or time) to hire someone better. Perhaps hiring that person is important to the company (or to the manager) for reasons you don't know (even if the candidate is incompetent). And that candidate might be incompetent, but willing to learn and pleasant to work with. Probably the company is expecting you to teach him things. BTW, the workplace is not a rational or optimal world. 

It sounds like you do HR, Benefits Administration, Accounting, Compliance and Executive Business Administration. You can probably use any one (or more) of those titles on your resume legitimately. Titles aren't always very exact; there can be a lot of variation in duties for the same title between organizations. They're also fairly localized. It wouldn't be a bad move to check job descriptions for those titles and see how well they match up with your experience. 

Excellent idea. BTW, if working in the software business, contributing to some free software project (e.g. on github) on your spare time is an excellent thing to do (that you can show on your CV) and will improve your developer skills. What would happen afterwards: you'll start searching for new jobs in a few months. You'll find one say in September 2018 (five months from now). Your official resigning period could be of two or 3 or 4 months (I don't really know, details could be specific to your job or country). During that period, you'll work for your current employer and use your newly acquired skills. So for your company's perspective, they paid you a training, and it was useful to them for several months. That is enough. Notice that in most European countries, companies are required to spend a few percent of their work costs in training. Details vary from country to country, from one industrial branch to another, from company to company. So the company might not make you a special favor to follow that training. alternative situations Your situation might be completely different. Some rare jobs require very specific and quite long training (e.g. driving helicopters for someone who have no pilot license at all; or soldering nuclear reactors) and certification. In those rare cases you could have to sign some specific contract (defining how long you'll work at your company, or what part of the training would you have to pay back when leaving). But you did not mention that! 

When a request comes in for you to travel, try to find other ways to accomplish the same things that the travel would. Focus on solving the problem here; not that you can't travel. Software development offers a lot of leeway for physical presence that carpentry (for example) does not. 

For each travel request, re-state your personal commitments and at the same time try to re-negotiate the travel requirements in a way that would work for you. For example: 

Do you own the company? If not, hiring decisions are the company business, and you should not care about them. If you are really annoyed, consider looking for some new job. Managers make mistakes all the time and are usually incompetent (read about Peter's principle...). BTW, you probably won't manage better than your current manager (because the brain of the human species is not well suited for management). 

Strongly consider the bird in the hand - moving forward with Company B's job offer. You can't predict what will happen in fall. Perhaps you will find that, as a permanent employee, your job has changed such that you like it. Or you may find other opportunities within the same company that you do like. If in fall (right after your 3 week vacation?) you do still want to quit, try sticking around while doing a job search instead. You will then still have a job which removes a lot of pressure will looking for a new job, and you will be a more desirable candidate for a new job. 

That is his problem, not yours. (If you follow the training, your concern is to learn stuff and improve your skills, notably stuff useful for your company). Your boss is not your friend. Your company is not your mother. They could fire you when needed. BTW, of course if the training is not interesting for you and push you in a career direction you don't want (e.g. if the training is about project management and you want to stay in the technical world) you should tell and explain why it does not fit very well your expectations. Also, from your company's perspective, not training you could require them to fire you and hire someone else with required qualifications. That costs a lot (typically several dozens of thousands of euros) and takes some time (months of bad productivity). Learn more -by googling german law or lander or industry regulations, by re-reading your work contract, by asking your union, ... but preferably not HR (they are not your friends!)- about your contractual obligations after your training (how much are you required to stay at your company, or to reimburse when leaving it). It is what matters.
