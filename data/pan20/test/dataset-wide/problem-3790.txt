It is known, as others have pointed out, which quadratic fields are Euclidean with respect to the absolute value of the norm. In the complex quadratic case, every Euclidean ring is norm-Euclidean (Motzkin); in the real quadratic case, there are examples (by students of Murty, namely Clarke and Harper) of Euclidean rings that are not norm-Euclidean. By a result of Weinberger, every real quadratic field with unique factorization is Euclidean assuming the generalized Riemann hypothesis. The ring of integers in a quadratic number field is not a UFD if its class number is nontrivial; it is easy to construct examples by making $c$ a product of at least three primes. It is believed but not known that infinitely many quadratic number rings have class number $1$. 

Capitulation is also at the center of the Greenberg conjecture in Iwasawa theory. In addition, its analogue in the theory of abelian varieties is the visibility of Tate-Shafarevich groups; for a recent contribution in the other direction see Schoof and Washington's article on´the "Visibility of ideal classes". 

Let $K$ be a CM field with maximal real subfield $k$. Most of the time the normal closure of $k$ will have the symmetric group $S_g$ as Galois group; thus the number of fields $k$ in which $p$ splits completely has density $1/g!$ among all of them by density theorems due to Kronecker, Frobenius and/or Chebotarev. In about half of the cases, $p$ will also split in $K$, giving $1/(2 \cdot g!)$ as a rough estimate. It is not necessarily true, however, that the density of fields with the symmetric Galois group is $1$ when the fields are ordered by discriminant. It is my impression that the corresponding problems are still open for $g > 5$, although there might be conjectural densities in the articles by Malle etc. Thus you should be able to get a definitve answer for $g \le 4$ using known results (check the articles by Cohen et al. on the distribution of Galois groups), and perhaps $g = 5$ using recent advances e.g. by Bhargava. 

Consider the well known continued fraction expansion $$ z \tan z = \frac{z^2}{1 - \cfrac{z^2}{3- \cfrac{z^2}{5 - \ldots}}} $$ of the tangent function going back to Euler and Lambert (Lambert used it for showing that $\tan z$ is irrational for rational nonzero values of $z$, which implies the irrationality of $\pi$; Legendre later observed that the same proof gives the irrationality of $\pi^2$). Wall. in his book on continued fractions, claims that the formula is valid "for all $z$". Is there a nice way of determining the poles of $\tan z$ from looking at the right hand side of this expansion? 

The transfer map even makes sense in the abelian case, where it encodes pieces of the decomposition law (in other words: of the reciprocity law). Gauss's Lemma in his fifth proof of the quadratic reciprocity law is basically a computation of the transfer from the rationals to the maximal real subfield in the p-th cyclotomic field. This is more of a lower than a higher reason, but I'm afraid I can't say anything enlightening; after all, this is a map coming up (naturally) in the cohomology of group extensions, and many of these maps "are just there". 

Consider the series $$ S_f = \sum_{x=1}^\infty \frac{f}{x^2+fx}. $$ Goldbach showed that, for integers $f \ge 1$, $$ S_f = 1 + \frac12 + \frac13 + \ldots + \frac1f $$ (this follows easily by writing $S_f$ as a telescoping series). Thus $S_f$ is rational for all natural numbers $f \ge 1$. Goldbach claimed that, for all nonintegral (rational) numbers $f$, the sum $S_f$ would be irrational. Euler showed, by using the substitution $$ \frac1k = \int_0^1 x^{k-1} dx, $$ that $$ S_f = \int_0^1 \frac{1-x^f}{1-x} dx. $$ He evaluated this integral for $f = \frac12$ and found that $S_{1/2} = 2(1 - \ln 2)$ (this also follows easily from Goldbach's series for $S_f$). Thus Goldbach's claim holds for all $f \equiv \frac12 \bmod 1$ since $S_{f+1} = S_f + \frac1{f+1}$. Here are my questions: 

The parity conjecture for elliptic curves predicts that the rank of an elliptic curve defined over the rationals has the same parity as the p-Selmer rank for a prime number p. Could anyone familiar with the recent development sketch what has happened in the last few years, and what the state of the art is? 

Artin's work on zeta functions began in 1923 (actually zeta functions had already played a role in his thesis on quadratic extensions of the rational function field) with an article "On the zeta functions of certain algebraic number fields". There he studied a problem due to Dedekind which asked whether the zeta function of a number field is always divisible (in the sense that the quotient is entire) by the zeta function of any of its subfields. Dedekind had proved this for purely cubic fields, and for abelian (and in fact metabelian, then called metacyclic) extensions it follows from the decomposition of Dedekind's zeta functions into a product of abelian L-series due to Takagi's class field theory. Artin then computed explicitly the zeta functions for subfields of an $S_4$-extension, where the factors contributed by a prime ideal ${\mathfrak p}$ depends on the decomposition group of ${\mathfrak p}$, and then he sketched a similar calculation for the icosahedral group. For unramified primes, these factors all have a natural interpretation in terms of the Frobenius automorphisms, or, in other words, come from a Galois representation. One can do worse than read Harold Stark's beautiful article in the book "From number theory to physics", where even simpler examples all presented in all their glory. In Artin's first article on L-series (On a new kind of L-series, 1923) Artin defined the Euler factors of the L-series attached to a Galois representation only for unramified primes. This was sufficient (if not very satisfying) for the following reason: Artin could write the zeta function of $K$ and all of its subfields as products of his L-series. Hecke had shown in 1917 that L-series whose Euler factors agree up to at most finitely many primes actually have equal Euler factors if both L-series satisfy the same functional equation. So if you can show that Artin's L-series satisfy a functional equation with suitably defined (but not explicitly known) factors at the ramified and infinite primes, then everything is fine. At the end of this artice, Artin takes up his example of the icosahedral group again. In his sequel "On the theory of L-series with general group characters" from 1930, Artin observed that the state of the theory was not satisfactory and proceeded to define the "local" factors (local class field theory was being developed simultaneously by Hasse; Artin's reciprocity law had allowed a new approach to the norm residue symbols, and this led more or less automatically to local class field theory) from the start. He does this by starting with a Galois representation, observing that for ramified primes, the "Frobenius automorphism" is only defined up to elements from the inertia group $T$, and then constructs a representation of $Z/T$, the factor group of decomposition modulo inertia group; then he uses this "piece" of the representation for defining the local factors at ramified primes. Parts of the necessary arguments can be found in Artin's article on the group theoretic structure of the discriminant in algebraic number fields that appeared in print in 1931. In his letter to Hasse from Sept. 18, 1930, Artin gives the following explanation (the notation is essentially the same as in his articles): 

Siegel proved that all continued fractions $$ \frac{1}{a_1 + \cfrac{1}{a_2 + \cfrac{1}{a_3 + \ldots}}} $$ in which the $a_i$ form a nonconstant arithmetic sequence are transcendental. Applying this to the continued fraction expansion of $\frac{e-1}{e+1}$ gives the transcendence of $e$. Siegel's proof uses, predictably, analytic machinery (solutions of Bessel and Riccati differential equations) going far beyond Liouville's theorem. 

Observe that we only have to check the claimed inequality for $n \le 7$. Since the result holds for $R$ large and very small, I would guess that its proof is within reach. Good luck! 

As for your second question: if $f$ is an irreducible polynomial woth degree $n$ and prime discriminant (actually, squarefree discriminant is sufficient), then the roots of $f$ generate an extension with Galois group $S_n$ (thus these examples are not necessarily the best candidates for testing conjectures since you miss out on all the more interesting Galois groups). Since $S_n$ is not solvable for $n \ge 5$, class field theory is your friend only for $n = 2, 3, 4$. 

Let me first give a formulation of the question that makes a little bit of sense. Let $K/F$ be a quadratic extension of a number field, and let $L/K$ be a class field for an ideal group $D_L$ with index $2$ in the group of all idealc coprime to some defining modulus. 

Approaches 2 and 3 go back to Hasse [Arithmetische Theorie der kubischen Zahlkörper auf klassenkörpertheoretischer Grundlage; Math. Z. 31 (1930), 565-582] and Reichardt [Arithmetische Theorie der kubischen Körper als Radikalkörper; Monatsh. Math. Phys. 40 (1933), 323-350]. Edit: I also should have given the origin of approach 1, since it is most often (incorrectly) credited to Delone and Faddeev. In the preface to their book Irrationalities of the third degree, however, they do credit F.W. Levi with this observation: see Kubische Zahlkörper und binäre kubische Formenklassen (Cubic number fields and classes of binary cubic forms), Leipz. Ber. 66 (1914), 26-37 

I have always wondered why there are so many books on diophantine equation, but few if any explaining some simple geometric techniques useful for finding rational points on algebraic surfaces. Is there such a book out there? 

This is Theorem 2 in D. Lehmer & E. Lehmer, On runs of residues, Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Feb., 1962), 102-106. The proof there uses quadratic reciprocity and Dirichlet's Theorem on primes in arithmetic progression. They also deal with similar problems for k-th powers. 

see Mollin's paper and the various references given there. You will probably also find relevant material in his book "Quadratics". 

Step 1 is analogous to the construction of the fields of $p^n$-th roots of unity (in particular, proving the irreducibility of the corresponding cyclotomic polynomials and determining their dirscriminants), whereas Step 2 is the analogue of the theorem of Kronecker-Weber. Step 1 Takagi (thesis, Sect. 6) constructs the following cyclic extensions of ${\mathbb Q}(i)$: 

This is more of a longish comment explaining why I believe that the answer should be yes, and that a confirmation should be within reach using current technology. Let $K$ be the field of $n$-th roots of unity, and $\zeta_p$ a primitive $p$-th root of unity for some prime factor $p \mid n$. The question is whether there is a nonsquare unit $\omega \in {\mathcal O}_K^\times$ such that $\omega \equiv 1 - \zeta \bmod 4$. I can see no reason why such units should not exist, even in the special case $n = p$. But one may have to look for a while before stumbling over an example. The related problem of finding a nonsquare unit $\omega \equiv 1 \bmod 4$, for example, is not solvable for $n = p < 29$ since the corresponding cyclotomic fields have odd class number; ${\mathbb Q}(\zeta_{29})$, on the other hand, has a class group of type $(2,2,2)$ and a good chance of containing such a unit. This can probably be verified by looking only at cyclotomic units, which are known explicitly. In your case, you should look at products of units of the form $$ \omega = (1+\xi)^{a_1}(1+\xi+\xi^2)^{a_2}(1+\xi+\xi^2+\xi^3)^{a_3} \cdots $$ with not all $a_j$ even, and check whether one of these lies in the residue class $1 - \xi^j \bmod 4$. Using sage or pari, this should actually be doable. Perhaps some linear algebra and the Chinese remainder theorem can be used to speed up the calculations. Edit. I was so convinced that there would be a solution of the problem for a small $n$ that I did not do what I should have done: the problem in question is equivalent to the congruence $\omega \equiv \alpha^2 (1 - \zeta) \bmod 4$ for some cyclotomic integer $\alpha$ coprime to $2$. I guess Dror's code can easily be adapted to the more general congruence. 

Here are a few complementary remarks. The first nontrivial result on class field towers before Golod and Shafarevich was Scholz's proof that for every positive integer $n$ there exist class field towers of length $n$. His proof was completely constructive: given a prime $\ell$, he chose $n+1$ prime numbers $p_j \equiv 1 \bmod \ell$ satisfying certain congruence conditions and showed that the compositum of the cyclic $\ell$-extensions inside the fields of $p_j$-th roots of unity has an unramified extension whose Galois group has stage $n$. I guess that it is possible to extract the Galois group from his proof; note, however, that his unramified extension certainly is not maximal in general. Artin later found a short proof of Scholz's result: given any finite group $G$, let $L/K$ be a normal extension with Galois group $G$ (this is easy). Then choose an extension $F/K$ disjoint from $L/K$ and generated by a root of a polynomial $p$-adically so close to that of $L$ that the whole ramification vanishes when the extension is lifted to $F$; then $LF/F$ is unramified with Galois group $G$. This construction is, unfortunately, pretty useless for infinite groups.
