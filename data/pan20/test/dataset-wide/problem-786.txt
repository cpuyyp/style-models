Yes. The tidal locking of the moon with respect to the earth means that the moon rotates once and it axis in exactly the same time it requires to orbit the earth. To always see the same side of earth you have to orbit it in the same time as the earth needs to rotate about its axis, i.e. in 24 hours. The moon orbit around the earth takes about 27 days, so from the moon you'll see the earth rotate below you, and in time you get to see all sides of it. The orbit period is dictated by the distance from the earth; objects farther from the earth will orbit it more slowly, objects closer by more rapidly. In order to always see the the same side of earth an object needs to be at a particular place, a geostationary orbit, which is in the equatorial plane. This is at 42000 km from the center of the earth, or about 36000 km above its surface. Television and other communication satellites are in a geostationary orbit, and this orbit is so crowded that satellites sit at just a few tens of kilometers from their neighbors. Everybody wants her satellite at the right longitude to service North America or Europe. Kepler's 3rd Law says that there's a fixed relationship between the orbital period squared and the distance cubed. For instance the moon's period in days squared is about 750. If you divide the moon's distance cubed by the geostationary orbit's distance cubed you get this same number. 

Luminosity is the total energy output of a star per unit time. For example, our own Sun has a luminosity of $3.828\times 10^{26}\ \mathrm{Joules/second}$. Our Sun outputs more energy in a single second than the entire world consumes in a year. The absolute magnitude is, in some ways, analogous to luminosity in that it is a measure of the energy output of a star. The definition of absolute magnitude is that it is the magnitude a star would have if it were 10 parsecs from an observer. Obviously understanding this definition requires understanding the magnitude system, which is outside the scope of the question and I will not be explaining it here. 

If we are to consider that the moons are orbiting around the central planet, then the planet must be fairly massive. If all three of your bodies are of a similar or comparable mass, you'd have a much different (and not necessarily stable) type of orbit than what you're describing (see this link for example). The fact that you have two moons orbiting your planet, without your planet having a noticeable orbit about the moons, implies the planet has most of the mass of the system. This results in one of two scenarios, either 

The graph shows how temperature and energy drop as the universe expands in the first seconds after the BB. Note that at 1000 seconds (about 20 minutes) the energy is too low to create electrons (0.5 MeV), let alone heavier elements. What is created in the expansion, though, is dark energy. Its density is constant, so when the universe expands to double its size the amount of dark energy will also be doubled. (That's the reason why the expansion goes ever faster and faster, with nothing to stop it.) 

All light we see is from the past. The light from a light bulb at 3 meter distance arrives 10 ns after it left the bulb in your eye. For short distances this delay is negligible (10 ns is 10 billionths of a second), but at astronomical scale it becomes significant. Light from the Sun takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach the Earth, so when we see the Sun it's the Sun like it was 8 minutes ago. If the Sun would suddenly die we wouldn't notice for 8 minutes. The same goes for other stars in our Galaxy. The light from a star at 4 light years takes 4 years to reach us; it's the definition of a light year. One could make the following comparison: suppose there's a town at 100 car years from where you live. That means it takes a car 100 years to reach you. When a car from that town reaches you today it left in 1914. It won't be a 2010 sedan, but a Ford T. As the car arrives you're looking 100 years in the past. This looking into history is very convenient for cosmologists. You want to know what galaxies looked like 13.5 billion years ago, when the Universe was still young? Well, look for light that's been underway for that time. It left the galaxy under study 13.5 billion years ago and shows you what that galaxy looked like at the time. It doesn't tell you anything about the current state of it. It may have collided with another galaxy or absorbed by a black hole. There's no way of knowing other than waiting another 13.5 billion years, until the light emitted now will reach us. Another interesting thing to observe from that far past is the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB). It's the radiation from the Big Bang, which has been underway for 13.8 billion years. Of course today the Big Bang is history, but thanks to the "limited" light speed this history is continuously underway to us. 

Even the addition of this thin, weak atmosphere dropped the height achieved by an order of magnitude. Thick Atmosphere Let's up the density of the air and make the atmosphere extend more by increasing the scale height. Now ($kg/m^3$) and ($\mathrm{meters}$). The output is: 

Here's my approach to solving this problem. You provide some of the initial steps, but I'll still go through them just for completeness. Orbital Distance We're told the period is $T=5.5\:\mathrm{years}$. This means we can immediately calculate the orbital distance (or more precisely, the semi-major axis, $a$). Since we're talking about a comet orbiting the Sun, we can simply use: $$T^2 = a^3$$ where $T$ is the orbital period in units of $\mathrm{years}$ and $a$ is the semi-major axis in units of $\mathrm{AU}$. I find that $a = 3.116\:\mathrm{AU} = 4.66\times 10^{11}\:\mathrm{m}$. Good so far. Volume of Evaporated Shell We're told that the radius of the comet decreases by $\Delta R = 20\:\mathrm{cm}$. We can assume the comet is perfectly spherical and calculate the volume of the evaporated shell which should depend on both $R$, the radius of the comet, and $\Delta R$. This will be necessary since we need to know the total amount of ice that was evaporated. The volume of this shell is given by $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(R^3-(R-\Delta R)^3)$$ $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(R^3-R^3+3R^2\Delta R-3R\Delta R^2 + \Delta R^3)$$ $$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi(3R^2\Delta R-3R\Delta R^2)$$ $$V = 4\pi R^2\Delta R\left(1-\frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)$$ Note that I've made a specific choice here. I've dropped the $\Delta R^3$ term from the second line. The reason being that it is a third order term and $\Delta R^3 \ll R\Delta R^2$. You could argue that I could drop the second order term, $R\Delta R^2$ since $R\Delta R^2 \ll R^2\Delta R$, but I'm choosing to keep this second order term around so we wind up with an $R$ to solve for in the final answer. Power Input The next step is to find the total energy input per second to this comet, e.g., the power. You've basically already defined this part. The flux on this comet is defined as $$F = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi a^2}$$ The power input is simply the flux times the area of the comet. $$P_{\mathrm{in}} = FA = \frac{L_\odot}{4\pi a^2} \pi R^2 = \frac{1}{4}L_\odot \frac{R^2}{a^2}$$ Note that this assumes the comet is in a circular orbit and thus always at the orbital radius of $a$. If the comet's orbit had any sort of eccentricity, then $F$ would be a function of radius and you'd have a much harder time. Evaporation Energy Now we need to calculate the total energy necessary to evaporate the evaporated shell of volume $V$ from above. In order to evaporate a solid ice, you have to go through four stages of heating. First, you raise the ice's temperature to the melting point. The energy input for this is defined by the specific heat capacity for ice, $c_{\mathrm{ice}}$. Then you add energy to convert the ice into water. The energy input for this is defined by the latent heat of fusion, $\ell_f$. Now you can raise the temperature of the water until it reaches the next stage. This is defined by the specific heat of water, $c_{\mathrm{water}}$. Finally, you add energy to convert the water to gas, defined by the latent heat of vaporization, $\ell_v$. All of these can be put together into a single equation. $$E_{\mathrm{evap}} = c_{\mathrm{ice}}(m_{\mathrm{shell}}\Delta T_1) + \ell_fm_{\mathrm{shell}}+c_{\mathrm{water}}(m_{\mathrm{shell}}\Delta T_2) + \ell_vm_{\mathrm{shell}}$$ $$E_{\mathrm{evap}} = (c_{\mathrm{ice}}\Delta T_1 + \ell_f +c_{\mathrm{water}}\Delta T_2 + \ell_v)m_{\mathrm{shell}}$$ Each one of the terms in this equation accounts for the energy input of one of the stages I described above. Note that $\Delta T_1$ is the temperature change from the initial temperature to the melting point ($273.15\:\mathrm{K}$). A reasonable temperature change might be $73.15\:\mathrm{K}$ (assuming an initial temperature of $200\:\mathrm{K}$), based on the temperature of comet 67P as determined by Rosetta. The $\Delta T_2$ is the temperature change from the melting point to the boiling point which is necessarily $100\:\mathrm{K}$. You can look in a table somewhere and find that $c_{\mathrm{ice}} = 2.108\:\mathrm{kJ\:kg^{-1}\:K^{-1}}$ and $c_{\mathrm{water}} = 4.187\:\mathrm{kJ\:kg^{-1}\:K^{-1}}$. Lastly, you need to define the mass of the evaporated shell, $m_{\mathrm{shell}}$. This is simply the volume already determined, multiplied by the density of ice/water. Technically those densities will be different, but they're close enough that we can just use $\rho_{shell} = 1000\:\mathrm{kg\:m^3}$. So ultimately we have: $$E_{\mathrm{evap}} = (c_{\mathrm{ice}}\Delta T_1 + \ell_f +c_{\mathrm{water}}\Delta T_2 + \ell_v)V \rho_{\mathrm{shell}}$$ For simplicity's sake, I'm going to define $$\eta \equiv (c_{\mathrm{ice}}\Delta T_1 + \ell_f +c_{\mathrm{water}}\Delta T_2 + \ell_v)$$ so that $$E_{\mathrm{evap}} = 4\pi \eta \rho_{\mathrm{shell}} R^2\Delta R\left(1-\frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)$$ Putting it all together We now know the total energy necessary to evaporate the comet's $20\:\mathrm{cm}$ shell as well as the energy input per second. We know that it receives this energy input per second for one orbital period of $5.5\:\mathrm{years}$ which means we can say: $$T = \frac{E_{\mathrm{evap}}}{P_{\mathrm{in}}}$$ $$T = \frac{4\pi \eta \rho_{\mathrm{shell}} R^2\Delta R\left(1-\frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)}{\frac{1}{4}L_\odot \frac{R^2}{a^2}}$$ $$T = 8\pi \eta \rho_{\mathrm{shell}} \Delta R \frac{a^2}{L_\odot} \left(1-\frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)$$ Again, for simplicity, I'll define $$\xi \equiv 8\pi \eta \rho_{\mathrm{shell}} \Delta R \frac{a^2}{L_\odot}$$ so that $$T = \xi \left(1-\frac{\Delta R}{R}\right)$$ It should be pretty easy to see now that $$\boxed{R = \frac{\Delta R}{1-T/\xi}}$$ The rest is just plugging everything in. 

Measure the distance to a star and its direction, and plot it based on these numbers in a 3D plot. Repeat for a gazillion other stars. From its appearance in the sky we can already infer that the Milky Way is rather flat; most stars (and gas clouds) can be found in a rather narrow band in the sky. That the Milky Way is a spiral galaxy is something you can't see with the naked eye (nor with a telescope), but it's something you can derive from the 3D model. The 3D model also tells us where the sun is in the Milky Way: there are far more stars in one direction than the other, and the former ones are also farther way. This way we know we're about 2/3 from the center of the galaxy. 

If cosmological inflation occurred at speeds less than $c$, wouldn't we see the CMB right in front of our noses (or not at all) instead of at 13.7 billion light years? And if it happened faster than $c$, does that mean inflation occurred before the current laws of physics (read the four basic forces) precipitated, was $c$ greater then than it is now? 

The chance happenstance that Earth happened to be floating along and got captured is minuscule. How did Earth wind up floating through space? There's no established mechanism for terrestrial planets to form on their own. As far as we know, they need a host star to form around. So if our Sun captured Earth, it must've formed around another Star, got ejected somehow, and then came under the influence of our Sun where it was captured and nicely placed at its current position. This is all highly, highly unlikely. I'm not going to run through the math, but you probably have a better chance of getting struck by lighting at the exact moment you buy a winning lottery ticket (twice). Aside from a statistical argument, you can look at it from the vantage point that the composition of the Earth properly matches everything else in our solar system. People have made a very close study as to the physical composition of Earth, the Moon, and the other planets and bodies in our solar system. We would have noticed if there was a large disparity in composition or something just didn't match up. As it is, Earth matches up pretty darn well, especially with our Moon. The close resemblance in composition between our Moon and Earth gives strong evidence that the Moon was formed from the Earth. If Earth was captured, so too was the Moon which makes point 1 even less likely. Many people have spent a lot of time simulating the formation of our solar system, from the start up until now. There are a few open questions (such as why Jupiter resides where it does), but by and large, people agree that a planet should form about where Earth is. So if Earth wasn't here during formation and was later captured, why isn't there an extra planet that did form where Earth is? All simulations suggest such a planet should exist. The most likely scenario is that Earth is that planet! It is believed that basic life (i.e., single celled organisms) started on Earth around 3.8 to 4.1 billion years ago. Earth itself has been reliable dated to about 4.53 billion years old. This means life was forming a mere 400-700 million years after Earth first formed. Life requires very very specific conditions (as we know it) to start forming and that can't happen in the dead of space. Earth had to be around a star from the beginning. Any time spent drifting through space until it was captured would have delayed the onset of the formation of life. 

A note: don't talk about inflation for the current expansion. Inflation is the brief period immediately after the BB when the universe expanded at an outlandish rate. Matter was formed when the universe was so compact that its temperature was billions and even trillions of Kelvin hot. The energy of the vacuum in any given volume was so high that matter-antimatter pairs were created, which usually quickly annihilated. Sometimes, however those short-lived particles collided, releasing large amounts of energy. For instance, to create an electron you need an energy of 0.5 MeV. The graph below shows that at a temperature of $10^{16}$ K collision energy could be as high as 1 TeV. Because of its expansion the universe has cooled so much that its temperature is less than 3 K, which isn't nearly enough to create any new particles. 

Planes traveling east, for instance from the US west coast to the east coast, or from America to Europe, take advantage of this jet stream to save fuel. Note that the jet stream isn't anywhere as fast as the earth's rotation. At 50 degrees north the earth's rotation is about 1000 km/h, while the jet stream is about 200 km/h. 

That is precisely the wrong statement. The fact that the Earth is still spinning matches our physical laws exactly. The physical law I'm specifically referring to is known as Newton's First Law of Motion, which is loosely paraphrased as: 

Let me preface my answer by saying that you're reading a book from 1937 which references the scientific knowledge from the early 1900's. In case you're unfamiliar with astronomical history, I'll say that we've come a looong way since the early 1900's. For example, this book discuses "Nebula as Island Universes". At this point, astronomers had only just discovered that these mysterious "nebulae" were actually entire galaxies that were millions of light years away. Hubble is still referring to them as nebula though, rather than galaxies. That being said, it may actually be kind of difficult to "translate" some of this science from almost 100 years ago into modern theories and terminology. You may even find things which are flat out wrong. Hubble did make a lot of important discoveries, but there were many details he was mistaken on. Do more recent observations still show a symmetrical nebulae density increase? Again, nebulae here refers to galaxies, not what we've come to consider as nebulae. What you're asking here, and what Hubble was referring to, before it had an official name, is about the Cosmological Principle. I think the appropriate answer to this question though, is to point out that I believe you're misinterpreting the text. In the Comparison of Observations with Theory section, Hubble is showing that observations of nebulae (sic, galaxies) indicate they are uniform through space and that his uniformity is easily explained by a static, non-expanding universe. 

Newly born stars often have bilateral jets of gas ejected from them at high speeds (hundreds of km per seconds), often ending in Herbig-Haro objects. As I understand it those jets would have something to do with the star's magnetic field. How does this work? How can a magnetic field cause the high-energy ejection of matter? 

Both the R-process and the S-process of stellar nucleosynthesis rely on absorbing 1 (S) or more (R) neutrons. Where do they come from? I thought there are no free neutrons in stars. (Also the half-life of a free neutron is only 15 minutes, so the source has to be inside the star) 

The universe is thought to be flat: $\Omega = 1 \pm 1\%$. As I understand it we can determine this by measuring triangles against the CMB. Yet during inflation dark energy made the universe grew much larger than the radiation universe, of which the CMB is the limit. Isn't it possible then that at the "smaller" scale of our visible universe it appears flat, but at the universe's full size it's curved? A bit like a square of 1 meter sides on the surface of the earth also looks flat, while at larger scale the earth is curved. What are the chances that the 1% uncertainty could lead us to a universe with $\Omega \ne 1$?
