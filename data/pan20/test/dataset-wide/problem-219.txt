A lot of responses on here seem to be unable to get past the obstacle of the joke creator dying from thinking of the joke. That isn't a real obstacle, since, in theory, the joke could be devised by an AI program. Also, a lot of responses seem to be unable to get past the obstacle of how a messenger could relay the joke without dying. That also isn't a real obstacle, since the joke could be delivered via an internet message, telegram, video, etc. without human intervention. It's not unreasonable that after AI generates the joke, it could, in an automated fashion, use a bot account to send a private message to the victim via social media, or create a video and post it on youtube, or something of that nature. It is definitely within a computer program's ability to automatically generate videos, and you have probably seen some on youtube without knowing it. Can a person die from laughing at a joke? Yes. For the most part, this has a lot more to do with the person's overall health and psyche than the contents of the joke itself. But if a joke were gargantuanly hilarious, it might be able to kill many healthy people. It would just have to be a multiple of as funny as a joke that could kill an unhealthy person. Is a person and/or AI clever enough to construct a joke that is that funny? All I can say to speak to that is that there are already automated systems that make psychological profiles of everybody in America, use AI to formulate memes / rhetoric that would be most persuasive to influencing their opinion, and distribute it through social media using bots. So the same approach would definitely be usable to make automated systems that can make a deep psychological profile on a specific assassination target and formulate jokes that would be highly funny for that person. Even moreso, since said jokes are targetted for that person's unique psychological make-up, it might be lethal only to the target and some other similar people, and therefore might be sub-lethal for most other human messengers that are telling the joke. $URL$ Also, circle back to the theory that a lethal joke would kill the writer of the joke itself... if it is such a struggle to construct a joke that is lethal, and if your very best effort is barely sufficient to do the job, then this joke wouldn't be lethal to anyone that is marginally less vulnerable. So, for example, if a human architect of the joke found the joke 20% less funny, then it wouldn't kill them (this is a stretch, since people often find their own jokes funny). But messengers on the other hand... it's very plausible to teach the joke to a messenger in a way that is very unfunny, for example, by repeating the setup hundreds of times before they ever hear the punchline, or by teaching them the joke while under chemical sedation so that their heart rate never gets too high. By the time they're reciting the joke in a live setting, they've already heard the joke under sedation many times, they've rehearsed it in rote fashion, and the joke has gotten boring and routine. 

Practical is such a misunderstood word. It often is taken to mean possible. But really it means efficient. Your question is asking not are laser eyes possible but are they useful. It sounds like you are asking both questions though. Is it possible? Superman is alien. By definition not human. So comparisons to the human eye are a bit of a waste of time in his case. Superman is stronger faster and nearly indestructible. Sounds to me like any damage he could do to himself is nullified by his indestructibility. He flies into the sun for a recharge. A little laser wont bother him. As for where he gets his power. He flies into the sun for energy. He is solar powered. And the sun easily has the power to fuel laser eyes. The real question is it useful. A built in high powered perfectly accurate weapon? Yes it is useful. As for humans with laser eyes see the other answers here. But I thought it was worth pointing out the obvious exception to most of them. 

Unasked question: What is the internet? The internet is a bunch of computers connected to each other. To answer your question you will want to know some of the basic layers of the internet. I'm simplifying this but it should be enough to get you in the right direction. It's also worth noting that what is commonly referred to as the internet is actually the World Wide Web. And is only a small piece of the internet. File server, secure data servers, private networks, telephone lines, and someones publicly accessible hard drive on the home computer are all part of the internet as well. Physical layer - The internet must physically transfer data. This is done through phone lines (twisted pair), Ethernet cables (bundled twisted pair), Fiber optic cables (glass), Microwaves (electromagnetic), Radio waves (electromagnetic), etc. Your first task will be to determine how to connect physically to the internet. Radio waves or microwaves will depreciate too much to get to a satellite. You could run a relay to the top of the ocean (say 100ft under to keep hidden from ships). But this would results in nearly 2sec of latency (satellites are as far from the earth as it's circumference and it takes 1 sec for light to travel the circumference of the earth. It would be better to run some kind of fiber line to the nearest hosting facility getting you the expected 1/2s latency for most information. Packet/Data/Security Layer - You can't just read the data in the internet. It is encrypted, encoded, and packetized. Lets assume your computer is powerful enought to learn all this from context. Not realistic to be honest but it could learn via TV or Radio what it needs to get past the encoding and packetizing. So just play this off as "my computer is faster than earths entire technology infrastructure combined times 1 million or something like that." Protocol Layer - Most of the information on the internet is meta data not content. HTML tags, CSS, Javascript, etc. Browsers interpret all of this for us. Even the most intelligent of machines may need some help understanding what goes where. It would be appropriate for your machine to have a learning curve when displaying content. How do I connect to the internet? Probably with a piggyback line on a fibre optic cable or transcontinental microwave reciever. Either way somethign will physically have to leave the ship to intercept a decent signal and relay it back. Can I connect as a passive observer? Not really. You can do a "man in the middle" but you will only see what the specified "man" or "men" see. You will not be able to request specific data making it rather pointless. Can I connect without giving away my position? Not really. If you are just observing sure. but if you want info you need to give the "internet" an address to return the information too. No matter what the movies tell you you can't hide. If you were hidden you wouldn't be able to receive the information you requested. You can rapidly change the path the information travels if you control a dns but it still all has to end somewhere. 

The fauna in a world with no carnivores will not look like that of earth with the carnivores removed. Disease and both intra- and inter- specific aggression will likely be the major causes of mortality (popular science link re. disease: $URL$ Predation pressure is a major factor driving the grouping behaviour of animals, so without predators, many species may never evolve group living (whether that be organised sociality such as seen in many primates, for example, or the passive aggregations of savannah-dwelling herbivores.). Add to this the issues of disease - social transmission, decaying corpses of dead members of multiple species - and the likely outcome will be small groups or solitary individuals, possibly highly mobile (to avoid the rotting bodies). If the rotting corpse issue is explained away (perhaps the abundance of this resource has selected for bacteria that decompose corpses on an accelerated time scale), then the biology and behaviour of the herbivores will be shaped largely by whether their resources are defensible. Population sizes are likely to be large - given no predation - so territoriality will not be feasible as time/energy costs will be too high. Instead, individual resource patches would be defended, and this will favour large groups, which in turn require access to multiple resource patches to meet their collective nutritional needs. So intense inter-group competition, selecting for large-bodied, aggressive, 'weaponed' animals. With that in mind, and addressing the question: 

I believe the most common cause of dessert on earth is humans. The process is actually called desertification. It usually involved deforestation, poor farming practices, poisoning the ground, and a natural tendancy to low precipitation. However you state that this is a land that is "one" with nature. Option #1. Past Perhaps the people are one with nature because of what they did to this island. Option #2 Cataclysmic force. An earthquake, meteor, tsunami, volcanic eruption, or magical beast could have caused this. Option #3 End of the world. I think the sun is actually supposed to get colder as it gets older but a decaying orbit might draw the planet closer to the sun. This would result in storms, heat waves, unpredictable weather and general chaos. Wouldn't likely spare the other islands though. 

Clever idea. Worth considering a common "God problem." Does God exist inside of time and move freely or does he exist outside of time and poke the continuum to make things happen (thus everything happens at the same time from his perspective)? The answer to that philosophical debate is usually: It doesn't matter because the manifestation is the same either way. God appears to be unaffected by time. Magic existing and eliminating itself from existence has the net effect that it never existed. This is how it is handled in Michael Crichton's Sphere (the book I haven't seen the movie). We watch the disappearance of the magic then at the end of the book it never existed. Option 1: The Remnant. Your much better option is the Star Wars or Dr. Who approach. While it may feel cheep some of the best literature chooses a protagonist who sees, hears, or posses something the rest of the world does not. Making them interesting and allowing us to see the world through more informed eyes. This is often in modern day called a "Space Opera". Star Wars. The force doesn't exist anymore because all users died out. We know it existed once from legend but it doesn't matter nor do we understand the effects because no one uses it. Oh! Except this one guy who somehow survived the force genocide. Dr. Who. Very similar but this time it's a survivor. Maybe the magic was used up by one wizard who discovered the secret of immortality. He basically used all the energy of the earth to give himself life. In the process he also erased all other magic users from existence. Sort of a philosophers stone now. He has limitless power bought at the life of everything. Now your informed character can be the antagonist that some informed cult is hunting down or a protagonist that perhaps wishes to pay penance by restoring life to humanity but doesn't know how. Option 2: Artifacts or Secondary Effects. I was impressed to learn that archaeologist identify an ancient city or town by a few simple indicators. The one that caught my attention was the Right Angle. A single right angle tells them that something about this site is human made and unnatural. While no human remains were found, no actual structures, no pottery or tools, a single rock cut in a right angle says everything they need to know. Magic while never existed was not actually undone (If it was catch 22 it would have undone it's own undoing...). So perhaps their are "pieces of eden", Assasin's Creed floating around that everyone knows is from a past "technology" perhaps even magic. Or maybe their is ancient indestructible structures that are damaged and still around like "elder glass" in Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch. Option 3: Writings (much simpler) Tomes are likely gone but what about the stories. While they may be dismissed as folk tales they likely still exist and there is probably someone crazy enough to believe them. Option 4: Void Fish In a D&D podcast "The Adventure Zone" they have a creature that makes everyone forget something existed until you drink it's pee (episode 5 or 6 I think). Weird but the idea is maybe this fish or artifact ate the magic and contacting the artifact gives information about it's existence.
