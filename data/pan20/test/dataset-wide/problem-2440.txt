I think you said you wanted an example of an instance when pacifism prevailed (and that you're less interested in answers which cite other examples of pacifism not prevailing). Perhaps the following might count as one example. Bhumibol Adulyadej -- Crisis of 1992 

The Buddha argues that these are all impermanent, and not under our control, so we shouldn't think of them as self: we shouldn't think, for example, "I am this body" nor "I have this body"; and similarly for sensation, consciousness, etc. Because there's nothing that isn't impermanent, there's nothing that can be described as self (or as soul). 

The beginning is called "inconstruable" and you leave it at that, and return to a more important topic. See also The unanswered questions. As a former mathematician I distrust attempts to "prove" things by reasoning about "infinite" series (e.g. Zeno's paradoxes) -- IMO they prove nothing except that logic is untrustworthy -- that kind of reasoning doesn't really prove the existence (or non-existence) of God ... nor of literal rebirth. 

Afterwards are changes of the questions, sometime seemingly slight, does a change counts as a break? I think it was right (skillful) of you to post this comment ... 

This doesn't answer the question at all, of how to stop comparing yourself. Instead it talks about how to make use of it, and how to live with it. 

How is it different to love, sympathy and empathy There's a description of compassion, empathy, and love in the Brahmavihara article on Wikipedia, 

I think that (i.e. whether an afflictive emotion like "hatred" is "stilled" or not) is reminiscent of the "finger-trap" you mentioned. The first two verses: 

The "meditating on death" sounds like it's meant to be a meditation on impermanence, and on the unattractiveness of the body (i.e. an antidote to lust); as well as on the "just seeing" and so on that may be an antithesis to a excessive mental fabrication. But there may be another aspect to it (beware this is something I've been thinking about myself, and is not a thought that I've been reading or hearing about from others, so don't take this as an authoritative answer) which is 'real' in a different way: which is to do with how you handle time. If you consider not time but money for example, if you borrow money then that's a burden. "How will I pay the money back? I owe the money, I spent the money, how can I accumulate more money (more than I need) to pay back what I owe?" If someone says to me, "Would you like to...?", or, "Can you...?", if I have a debt then maybe I'm meant to say, "Sorry, I owe a lot of money and instead of doing that good thing you suggested I have to work to try to pay it back." In any case that doesn't seem like sukkha. According to this one of the questions they ask someone who wants to be ordained is, "Are you free from debt?" I think something similar happens with time: if I accumulate a time debt, if I have a lot of things to do, which I haven't done and which I need to do, which I owe to someone, then maybe that's not conducive to being free (in the "liberation" sense of enlightenment), it means that you're unable to do what you want or should. So I think that it may (at least for house-holders) be (not a mind-construction or reality-distortion but) a sīla practice, which ties into the notion that a result of virtue is the lack of remorse. I think a consequence of "living each day as if it's your last" might be that you have done (and continue to do) everything that you need to. It might fit into the notion of karma too, somehow: if you go around saying, "Sure I'll (promise to) do this, that, and the other..." 

The statement that "there are no people" sounded to me too similar to one of the definitions of "wrong view": 

I don't know whether Soto follows all these minor rules ... maybe it doesn't. Wikipedia's article about the Bodhisattva Precepts says, 

These don't quite match, "The ways of the world will never be finished"; but they are a good (maybe the best) match for, "find your own salvation with diligence". There are various English translations, e.g. it's often translated "diligence" instead of "earnestness". 

That the Buddha was a man, and lived a long time ago, are not the most interesting facts. And even the question 'who was he?' reminds me of 'the unanswered questions' ... ... so suggest you answer slightly different questions, for example: 'what did the Buddha do?'; or 'why is the Buddha important?'; and maybe make it personal like 'why is the Buddha important to us?' In general, 'near' (in time and space) and 'personal' (in relationships) are more 'important/interesting' than far away and impersonal/abstract. If you want to describe what the Buddha did, there are verbs you can use: for example the Buddha 'discovered' (or found out), the Buddha 'taught' (or told), ... If you want to describe the Buddha, consider the Anuradha Sutta in which the Buddha explained how (and how not) to do that. It ends with, 

That last sentence ("chase what we want and run from what we don't want") also implies what Buddhism calls "The Three Poisons": 

I guess that if you experience dukkha you can also sometimes experience the cessation or absence of dukkha. 

All conditioned things There's an example of this usage in the Buddha's last words (in the The Mahāparinibbāna Sutta), 

5 seconds to inhale 5 seconds to exhale Pause for about 5 seconds, until my body feels it wants to begin to take another breath to avoid a shortage 

I'm not a historian but, for example, perhaps if the "allies" had been more generous at the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 at the end of WW1, if the French hadn't wanted to further weaken defeated Germany as much as possible, then the conditions wouldn't have arisen for Germany to want to go to war again 20 years later. Maybe ditto if the USSR hadn't made a secret non-agression pact with Germany in 1939 (which it did maybe because of its own fear of Germany but also because of its own greed to invade Eastern Europe). Maybe they're all, you know, a bit guilty: could have done better. If you react harshly, where does that ever stop? And what behaviour do other people learn from you? Yet, Buddhism has survived 2500 years and even flourished at a time where war and cruelty were rampant. So there must be something there, and it bugs the heck out of me. Well, social cooperation (rather than social aggression) is maybe a winning strategy. For example people respect (and try to help) Buddhist monks, partly because they are intentionally harmless. 

I don't enjoy that kind of thing (i.e. "horror movies"), so I don't ever watch them and don't have to think about them. It might be a bit like asking, "how do we understand drug addiction?" and one answer is that most people aren't in an environment where they need to understand that: because they don't expose themselves to it. For a slightly similar reason to avoiding horror movies (i.e. in order to avoid their emotional contagion) I would prefer to read news articles, than listen to newscasters narrate news stories on television. I'm not sure that Buddhism has explanation for people enjoying this kind of thing. A partial conventional explanation might be that some people become habituated or tolerant. Someone who enjoyed it to begin with, and who then watched horror movies for another 20 years, might grow to tolerate (or enjoy) more horror (or simulated horror) than someone else with less experience of the genre: like someone who's been alcoholic for 20 years might tolerate a larger dose of alcohol than a 'normal' person could. Or maybe they learn to control their horror, see the movie as unreal, and have enough experience to say, "It's just a movie, clever cinematography, I wonder how then produced those special effects". 

How is this valid? It is not. The video titled Jesus was a Buddhist Monk BBC Documentary (on YouTube) is actually a copy of this: Did Jesus Die? (2003). According to Wikipedia: 

In summary the Buddha is called "self-awakened" because he himself figured out what he taught; monks can now follow the path which he discovered and taught. I guess that "being enchanted with form", having "passion" for forms, and "clinging" to forms is being described by analogy as a kind of being asleep, being unskillful, being unaware. 

There's a "Rhinoceros Sutta". I don't know any commentary on it, except Wikipedia. It's not exactly about, it's not only about, families. I guess I'd just want to add that: 

You would do yourself a disservice to assume that, having read Aristotle, you have a handle on Buddhist Dhamma too. Some essential differences include that they don't have the same goal, nor the same method/mechanism, not at all the same logic, nor the same experimental proof, nor the same practitioners. 

I think that the Buddha's being a "spiritual friend", in person to his contemporaries, and more generally as an example (an exemplar) or role model, means that he may fit that kind of definition. 

There's a Zen story titled, Non-Attachment, which I read as having suggested that it's better to avoid it: 

Suffering exists (gives various example including poverty, disease, old age, death) Suffering is caused by desire/attachment/craving (to have what you don't have, or to keep what you can't keep) There's a way which leads to the end of suffering That way is the eightfold path, which is: Right views; right aspirations; right speech; right behavior; right livelihood; right effort; right thoughts; and right contemplation. 

It's said that what people find satisfying is remembrance of their own virtue -- "forming no attachment" might be a bhikkhu's attainment, your mother and aunt might have slightly different values so you'd have to adjust your message to them or "the object" accordingly, to stay relevant. But anyway, if or when you're in contact, "you're wrong to hate your sister", "you hurt me", any negative or fault-finding message like that, might be counter-productive. 

Some (perhaps most) monks sometimes do travel in vehicles -- cars (and even airplanes) -- but, I gather, usually driven by a layperson. I think you'll find that in general there's a difference in custom between laypeople, and ordained monks and nuns: what you said, i.e. "it would have less chance of accidentally killing animals than driving or riding", also applies to agriculture (digging in earth), for example -- which again is forbidden to monks but not to laypeople. I note too that the reason given for not driving, in the FAQ above, is not so much kindness as to avoid being criticised by the lay people. 

Learning mathematics, I was warned to beware of logic based on an informal or naive definition of infinity (it is tricky and error-prone, see for example Zeno's paradoxes). According to Wikipedia, 4th century BCE Jain mathematicians distinguished between "uncountable" and "infinite" (see ref and ref and ref) but I'm not sure that other (Buddhist) literature/authors supported a similar, specific, precise, or modern meaning of the word "infinity". Some of The unanswered questions are questions about infinity: including whether the world is infinitely large, and whether it's eternal. If these two questions were unanswered for good reason, then perhaps your question should be too. 

Is Dogen saying that zen is nothing separate from scholastic "sects" If I can summarize the Butsudō from which your quote was taken, I think that what he's saying is that: 

Sex is forbidden to Buddhist monks. Perhaps you can consider them as proof (evidence) that sex is merely some desire but not a need. The rules of conduct for monks is written and well defined -- having sex would mean that person is no longer a monk. The Bhikkhuni Sutta is informative: food is a need; monks might have craving too (especially craving for enlightenment); monks might even have conceit (especially the conceit that, because someone else was able to attain release, then so can they); but not sex. Sex is forbidden (and, by implication, also unecessary, not a "need"). There's also a sutta which answers your theory ("What I am saying is simple. Till the time you are liberated you are bound to have cravings. Cravings produces Kamma. So it is a vicious cycle. You are stuck forever.") that because unenlightened people have desire then they can never become enlightened: see the Brahmana Sutta. Another metaphor might be, "A car in motion has momentum, therefore it can never stop." Well that's a theory but people can stop cars (using a brake, not using the accelerator, not refuelling the car, etc.). If yes that is the case then with all people who are enjoying writing in this forum. There are differences between enjoying sex and enjoying a movie; and other difference between enjoying this site. People might enjoy this site because it helps them to understand the Dhamma. The Dhamma is in some ways not like sex or a movie. One difference is that Dhamma is akalika i.e. "timeless". Perhaps the Dharma is (or can be) always helpful, always useful, no matter where and when you are. Desire to help others masquerades as compassion. Maybe it seems that way. Sometimes I feel as if I know at least partially the person who I'm writing to (on this site), but not always. In this post you were talking about and maybe trying to justify your sex life (which I know next to nothing about), and saying things I might not agree with (e.g. about "need") and so I didn't get the feeling that I knew who I was writing to -- maybe I'm not necessarily writing it to be "compassionate" to you. I find desires as the central point of origin of actions. Hmm. Maybe "intention" is the central point: we do things because we have some or other intention. That's suggested by the definition of "kamma" as "intentional action". And then, maybe "intention" is conditioned by "view": for example if you view sex as desirable, or view it as a need, then you intend to have sex. Conversely if you viewed liberation as desirable and sensuality as unsatisfying, then you might have a different intention. (That's suggested by the "noble eightfold path", which places "right intention" immediately after "right view"). I think compassion is mixed with desire in all our actions till we are liberated. One of the models of the path to liberation is that of the Four stages of enlightenment. According to that model, things like "identity view" and "doubts about the teachings" are the first fetters to overcome. "Sensual desire" is more persistent, and gradually overcome during the two stages after that. A kind of craving (for existence) continues until the last stage ... so maybe you're right that "desire" of some kind of other is persistent. Still, the second noble truth is that craving is a source of suffering. Feeding, fuelling, and enjoying addictions and self-justifying them as a "need" might not be the best way to reduce or eliminate craving.
