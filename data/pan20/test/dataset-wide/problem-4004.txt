Gerhard did not mess up. $\binom{r}{r/2}$ (or more precisely, the central binomial coefficient, but say $r$ is even) is an upper bound. If we shuffle the primes and multiply them together in random order, then the probability that we hit a given product of $k$ primes is $1/\binom{r}{k}$ (since it requires the first $k$ primes to be a specified set), and therefore at least $$\frac1{\binom{r}{r/2}}.$$ It follows that the probability that some partial product is in the given interval is at least $N/\binom{r}{r/2}$, where $N$ is the number of divisors in the given interval (since we never stay in such a short interval). Being a probability, this number is at most 1, which gives Gerhard's bound. My guess is that in reality that probability is more like $\log 2/\log r$, since if instead we add up the logarithms of the primes, we move in steps of size roughly $\log (r\log r) \sim \log r$, and we look for the probability of hitting an interval of length $\log 2$. This would suggest that $$N\approx \frac{\log 2}{\log r}\cdot \binom{r}{r/2}.$$ Edit: I'm fairly convinced that $N$ is of order $\binom{r}{r/2}/\log r$, but I'm not so sure about the constant $\log 2$, though it seems it gives asymptotically an upper bound. 

I came online to ask this question myself, as it came up today during a reading course on homological algebra. According to my professor, the zero module, even though it is trivially projective (as a trivial direct summand of any free module), does not have projective dimension 0, but rather $-\infty$. I cannot remember the precise reasoning he used. I believe it had something to do with the supremum of the empty set equaling negative infinity, although I don't remember how an empty set even came into the picture. The issue had come up from one of his papers in which a theorem he stated would turn out to be false for the zero module, as a reader pointed out. He responded that the theorem held only for modules of finite projective dimension and as such the zero module would be excluded. I also recognize that this question is over 2 years old, but for what it's worth, we have another candidate for the projective dimension of the zero module. And while I personally despise treating trivial cases, I acknowledge that a really good definition should always be able to account for them, making this question somewhat worthwhile? 

They are called De Bruijn graphs (De Bruijn graphs are generally considered directed, and can be defined over any set of symbols, not just $\{0,1\}$). 

(I'm editing after realizing that my conjecture that a convex equidissectable polygon must have an equidissection with all triangles meeting in a common vertex is very wrong.) Some background: An equidissection of a polygon is a dissection into triangles of equal area. The equidissection spectrum of a polygon is the set of all $n$ such that there exists an equidissection into $n$ pieces. A famous theorem of Paul Monsky states that the spectrum of the square is the set of all even positive numbers (the nontrivial part being that an equidissection into an odd number of pieces is impossible). Most quadrilaterals do not admit any equidissection, and there are quadrilaterals for which the existence of an equidissection is an open question. The wikipedia article on Equidissection describes more of the background. If a polygon can be equidissected into $n$ pieces, then it can obviously be equidissected into any multiple of $n$ by subdividing the pieces. So the spectrum is closed under multiplication by a positive integer. On the wikipedia page mentioned above, an example is given of a quadrilateral with a "non-principal" spectrum. It is equivalent to a "kite" with corners at $(-1,0), (0,-1), (2,0)$ and $(0,1)$. The two diagonals will divide the area in ratios 1 to 1 and 1 to 2 respectively, and therefore it allows equidissections into 2 and 3 pieces. My question is motivated by the observation (which can hardly be new, but is not mentioned in the wikipedia article or in this manuscript) that this kite also admits an equidissection into 5 triangles (or into any number $\geq 2$). To see this, draw straight lines from the point $(4/5, 3/5)$ to the vertices $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$. This will divide the kite into triangles of relative areas $1/5$, $2/5$ and $2/5$. More generally, suppose that $P$ and $Q$ are points (of the interior or the boundary) such that the straight lines from $P$ to the corners of the quadrilateral yield triangles whose areas are multiples of $1/m$ of the total area, and similarly the lines from $Q$ give areas that are multiples of $1/n$ of the total area. Then from the point $\frac {m}{m+n}\cdot P + \frac{n}{m+n}\cdot Q$ we will get areas that are of the form $$\frac{a}{m}\cdot \frac{m}{m+n} + \frac{b}{n}\cdot \frac{n}{m+n} = \frac{a+b}{m+n}$$ and therefore multiples of $1/(m+n)$ of the total area. Starting from $P=(0,1)$ and $Q=(2,0)$, we can therefore obtain equidissections of the kite into 5, 7 etc. parts. Similarly, the (non-convex) quadrilateral with vertices in $(-1,0)$, $(0,-1)$, $-2/3,0)$ and $(0,1)$ can be equidissected into 2 (obvious) or 3 (by the vertical line from $(-2/3,-1/3)$ to $(-2/3,1/3)$) pieces. And by continuing the boundary line between $(0,1)$ and $(-2/3,0)$ to the point where it crosses the line from $(0,-1)$ to $(-1,0)$, we divide it into triangles of relative areas $3/5$ and $2/5$, showing that an equidissection into 5 pieces is also possible. Let us say that a dissection is star-like if all triangles have a common vertex. The argument above shows that 

The answer is that you shouldn't believe everything you read on the arxiv... The result I claim in that paper is wrong, at least in that level of generality. The problem is that I try to use the completion of the bar resolution to compute Hochschild homology, but this isn't a free resolution. Your example is a good one. What I assume is going on here is the following: there are two simple objects in this category, given by the rank one free module with differential either $x$ or $-x$. Presumably they generate the category. Then the category is equivalent to the derived category of your algebra $A$, and its HH is $A$. If we only took one simple object it would generate a subcategory equivalent to $D^b(\mathbb{C})$, whose HH is just $\mathbb{C}$. I believe my complex is computing this answer, but I don't have much justification for this! If you're seriously thinking about this I would love to talk to you, and hopefully resolve this problem. 

Of course a highly non-convex polygon may have equidissections none of which are star-like, and it is easy to see that this might be the case also for convex polygons: Take a regular hexagon of unit area and label the vertices A, B, C, D, E, F. If we replace the vertex at A by a vertex at a point A' on the line through A parallel to the line BF, then the new hexagon still admits an equidissection into six pieces by cutting along the triangle BFD (and dividing the middle piece into three). But there are only countably many choices of A' for which there is some point P such that the six triangles with vertices in P and two adjacent vertices of the hexagon all have rational area. So perhaps the answer to my question is the obvious "No, why should it?", and the reason I haven't found a counterexample is just that dissections into a small number of pieces tend to be star-like. There is a short comment on the second page of this article that shows that the spectrum of a trapezoid is closed under addition, but I don't see how that would generalize. 

I'm sure the following statement is well-known to experts: Let $A$ be a dga. Let $perf(A)$ be the dg-category of perfect dg-modules over A. Then there is a quasi-isomorphism $$C_\bullet(perf(A)) \to C_\bullet(A)$$ between their Hochschild chain-complexes. Does anyone know a reference for it? I'm aware of Keller's 2003 paper that I think gives the result for Hochschild cochain-complexes, but I need the chain version. Thanks! 

Can anyone describe (or give a reference for) the 2d superspace formulation of N=(2,2) SUSY in Euclidean signature? I'm reading Hori's excellent introduction to QFT in the book 'Mirror symmetry', and my question is basically Ex. 12.1.1. page 273. What I imagine the answer is is a super version of the usual story of differential forms on complex manifolds, i.e. we complexify, find square roots of the $\partial_z$ and $\partial_{\bar{z}}$ operators, then find a subalgebra of 'chiral' fields analogous to the subalgebra of holomorphic forms. 

We're looking for a large set of exact sequences of vector bundles on Grassmannians. Here's the set up: $V$ and $Q$ are complex vector spaces of dimensions $d$ and $r$ respectively $(d\geq r)$, and we're working on the Grassmannian $Gr(V,Q)$. For simplicity let's fix a trivialization of $det(V)$. Now let $\alpha$ be a partition/Young diagram with at most $(r-1)$ rows and at most $(d-r)$ columns. Let $\beta$ be the Young diagram obtained from $\alpha$ by adding an extra row of length $(d-r)$ at the beginning. What we want is an exact sequence of vector bundles that goes $$\mathbb{S}_\alpha(Q)\otimes det(Q)^{-1} \rightarrow\;\; ... \;\;\rightarrow \mathbb{S}_\beta(Q) $$ ($\mathbb{S}$ denotes a Schur functor). For $r=1$ there's only one choice for $\alpha$, and the Koszul complex is the required sequence. For $d-r=1$ we have the short exact sequences $$\wedge^k Q \otimes det(Q)^{-1}\rightarrow \wedge^{k+1}V\ \rightarrow \wedge^{k+1} Q$$ We can also solve $r=2$ using Eagon-Northcott complexes. These known cases suggest that the exact sequence should have $(d-r+2)$ terms. Does anyone know a general construction? Update: we have a precise conjecture for the terms in the sequence. Let $\beta_0$ be the partition obtained from $\alpha$ by deleting the first column. Now define $\beta_i$ recursively as the partition obtained from $\beta_{i-1}$ by adding boxes to the $i$th column until it agrees with the $i$th column of $\beta$. In particular $\beta_{d-r}=\beta$. Then the terms in middle of the exact sequence should be $$...\rightarrow \wedge^{(|\beta| - |\beta_i|)} V \otimes \mathbb{S}_{\beta_i} Q \rightarrow... $$ If we fix a single point on the Grassmannian and split the tautological short exact sequence there then we can show that this works, which is pretty good evidence. Surely this isn't a new discovery? 

A favorite of mine is the chirality of the trefoil knot, which can be proved easily using the Jones polynomial or some of its relatives. Louis Kauffman's paper "New invariants in the theory of knots", $URL$ explains this nicely. I don't know how it was proved before the Jones polynomial, but quoting from p. 204 of Kauffman's paper, "In the old days (before 1984) this was something that required a lot of mathematical background." 

Here is an argument that shows that the expected number of drinks is $m^2/2$ for $m>1$, as noted by Barry Cipra. This is equivalent to saying that the expected number of drinks that an arbitrary person $A$ takes is $m/2$. Let $X_m$ be the expected number of drinks per person with $m$ participants. If $m\geq 2$, we get the equation $$X_m = \frac{m-1}m\left(1+a_2X_2+\cdots + a_mX_m\right),$$ where the factor $(m-1)/m$ is the probability that person $A$ picks somebody else's umbrella in the first round (otherwise he drinks nothing), the term 1 comes from the drink this causes him to take, and $a_k$ is the probability of exactly $k$ people picking someone else's umbrella in the first round, conditioning on $A$ doing so (trivially $a_0 = a_1 = 0$). Since $a_m(m-1)/m\neq 1$, this equation uniquely determines $X_m$ if we know $X_2,\dots,X_{m-1}$. Therefore we have the right to commit the cardinal sin of assuming that the induction step does go through, and just check that the resulting equation is consistent! Provided $X_k=k/2$ (linear!) for $k=2,\dots,m$, we can replace the terms $a_2X_2+\cdots + a_mX_m$ by $(m-1+1/(m-1))/2$, since the expected number of people who take their own umbrella, given that $A$ doesn't, is $1-1/(m-1)$ (it is 2 if he does). The equation then reads $$\frac{m}2 = \frac{m-1}m\left(1+\frac{m-1+\frac1{m-1}}{2}\right),$$ which simplifies to...I can't resist... $$0 = 0, \qquad \text{QED}.$$ 

I just wanted to take a second to post this paper: $URL$ In it, the author defines zeroth derived functors in abelian categories that do not have enough projectives or injectives. A brief piece of it: Let $C$ and $D$ be abelian categories. Take the functor category $(C,D)$ and consider any subcategory $S\subset (C, D)$ and then the full subcategory of $S$ consisting of left exact functors in $S$, $Lex(S)$. There is the canonical inclusion $s: Lex(S) \rightarrow S$. We say $S$ admits a zeroth right derived functor if there is a left adjoint (say $r^0: S \rightarrow Lex(S)$) satisfying two properties (we'll call the map $s\circ r^0$ the zeroth right derived functor and relabel it $R^0$): 1) The unit of adjunction $u: 1_s \rightarrow R^0$ is an isomorphism on injectives, and 2)The 'other'composition, $r^0\circ s$ is isomorphic to the the identity functor of the full subcategory of left exact functors of $S$. (The paper says something different, namely that $r^0\circ s \cong 1_S$. Based on the direction of the arrows, that composition should land in the $Lex(S)$. In general, the unit of adjunction has a kernel and by evaluating the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \ker u \rightarrow 1_S \rightarrow R^0$ at $F$, a functor from $C$ to $D$, we recover a definition for the injective stabilization of a functor $F$, as defined by Auslander and Bridger in Stable Module Theory. The author goes on to say that $r^0$ is a functor which takes functors $F$ and produces left exact functors $r^0F$. Then the inclusion $s(r^0F)=R^0F$ is the zeroth right derived functor of $F$, the result of making F left exact while changing as little as possible about the functor. Now, all this being said, I did not write the paper, and I do not know much more about the details. I just think the paper is an interesting one. 

One can get upper and lower bounds by reducing to the coupon-collector's problem. Let's say for simplicity that $r=1$. If we divide the surface of the table into squares of side 2, then in order to cover the table, we must have at least one droplet in each square. Since there will be about $\pi R^2 /4$ squares, we get a lower bound of roughly $(\pi R^2 /4)\log(\pi R^2 /4)$. Conversely, if we divide the surface into squares of side $1/\sqrt{2}$ so that the diagonal is 1, then to cover the table it suffices to have at least one droplet in each square, and we get an upper bound of roughly $(2\pi R^2)\log(2\pi R^2)$. I know that a substantial number of papers have been devoted to this sort of problem, so I guess there are more precise results available, but I don't have a reference off the top of my head. 

My guess is that such sets exist in all dimensions. Here's a partial answer that explains why. Let's consider tilings of a rectangular box of area $\zeta(\alpha)$ by axis-parallel rectangular tiles of areas $1/n^\alpha$ for some $\alpha>1$. We allow the tiles to be squeezed and stretched by axis-parallel linear transformations as long as the area is preserved. Suppose that we have carelessly placed the first $N$ tiles. Then the remaining space can be divided into $3N+1$ rectangular sub-boxes. Since the next tile has area roughly $(\alpha-1)/N$ times the remaining space, we can fit the next tile into the largest sub-box provided $\alpha<4/3$. If we don't permit squeezing and stretching, we might get into trouble because all sub-boxes that are large enough are too oblong. But it seems that if $\alpha$ is small enough and we subdivide in some reasonable way (say to minimize the total perimeter of the sub-boxes), then this should not happen.
