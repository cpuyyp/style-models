This student attempted to model the future income of college students based on a number of variables, and found that their SAT Math score was a significant factor, but that their SAT verbal scores were not. 

No, this is a fictional article. The source of the article is the World News Daily Report (WNDR). Their disclaimer page explains: 

Yes, they work... somewhat. They certainly affect behaviour, but it depends on the cat. A "real-world" experiment showed some deterrence: The efficacy of an ultrasonic cat deterrent, Sarah Helen Nelson, Andrew David Evans, and Richard Brian Bradbury, Applied Animal Behaviour Science Volume 96, Issues 1-2, January 2006, Pages 83-91 

(This also addresses an earlier discussion point that I didn't know what dose of fluoride I had swallowed today, by showing the model used to calculate it when determining the appropriate fluoridation levels in my country.) 

Interesting question. A quick search reveals lots of people claiming that only diamonds cut glass, and a lot of people claiming that many other stones will. When it comes to scratchability, Moh's Scale is a good measure. 

Conclusion Whether it is worth screening 1904 people to get the opportunity to treat enough people to save one life is an economic and ethical decision - presumably it should be compared to other competing services that could be offered to save more lives for the same price. Update: A recent study published in the British Medical Journal apparently updates the results to make mammograms seem even less helpful for 40-60 year old Canadian women, and expect recommendations will eventually be updated based on all recent evidence. 

Use medications according to the instructions. On average, they are more reliable than the Internet. 

Note: This paper has two co-authors in common with the above one, so should NOT be seen as independent confirmation. In a third report from some of the same co-authors, they claim: 

They followed 2,925 children over a period exceeding two decades. They divided them up into <5 km, 5–10 km and 10–15 km and >15km from the nearest NPP. 

There were multiple witnesses that gave testimony, with conflicting testimonies. Vox.com offers "A one-chart summary of every Ferguson eyewitness's grand jury testimony". 

I found more good evidence for a strong placebo effect: Effectiveness of quinine in treating muscle cramps: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre trial. Diener HC, Dethlefsen U, Dethlefsen-Gruber S, Verbeek P., Int J Clin Pract. 2002 May;56(4):243-6. PMID: 12074203 

The answer is going to depend on the region. In Australia, for example, The National Waste Report, claims that in 2006-07, 

In conclusion, it is difficult to get precise figures, due to a number of sources of biases and unknowns. (Even the binary dichotomy of homosexual versus heterosexual is clearly dubious.) However, studying the people who are caught suggests that men who are attracted to adult men are not at all in the highest risk of offending, even when the victims are boys. 

(Note: The last sentence is speculation. They did not observe weight-gain during the trial.) The same authors tried it again with obese women: 

The Australian Institute of Criminology found, when looking at the patterns of suicide by occupation: 

This study was examined by Orac who has been "checking in with and covering periodically ever since its inception in 2012, when antivaxers were fundraising for it." The study has had a history of being retracted: 

Wikipedia puts the number of priests charged, as of 2011, at "over 100" over all time, but unfortunately uses a broken link to a partisan site as evidence. 

This does not appear to be a suitable herb to be experimenting with. Your doctor has more carefully controlled doses of more carefully studied and more effective sleep-inducing medicine. 

I used to be a St John first aid volunteer and attended children's sporting events, where we were instructed to stay off the field until the referee summoned us. Typically, after a tackle left a young player lying on the ground, we would watch carefully as the coach would come out with a wet sponge, wipe the kids face and/or injury, and the kid would get up and get back into the game, perhaps limping slightly for effect. (The limp had generally disappeared a minute later, when the player was running for the ball.) The ritual of the "magic sponge" (as we first aiders knew it) was effective as it included the elements of a placebo: some attention, a little bit of rest for the pain and adrenaline to recede, and (by wiping away the tears, and giving an excuse for being better, despite the initial dramatics) gave back some dignity to the child. Of course, if the injury was more serious, we were standing by with some non-placebo remedies. I appreciate this does NOT directly address your question of movies and "olden times" medicine. However, it provides some anecdotal support that sponges can be effective placebos. 

Conclusion I haven't provided much solid evidence that particular polls are biases in particular way. I have provided evidence that the pollsters and analysts are not naive, and don't simply assume people are reliable. (I have used Wikipedia throughout, as my goal is not to prove that the effects are real, but merely that the risks are well-known.) 

Well-being is a better match to happiness than (non-)depression or (non-)suicide. This was an interesting study that showed that there were, perhaps unsurprisingly, cultural norms and socioeconomic factors involved in the question. Obesity is correlated with being poor in the U.S., but (apparently) not as much in Russia. In the USA: 

The study appears to be this one: Martin Voracek, National intelligence and suicide rate: an ecological study of 85 countries, Personality and Individual Differences 37 (2004) 543–553. Dr Voracek was from the University of Vienna Medical School, Austria, and this article was available online from 19 November 2003, which is a few weeks before the article, so the dates line up. While it isn't the main focus of the paper (which was trying to explain suicide rates), it does include a table (Table 1) with a list of 85 countries and their "National IQ". Of those 85 countries, 35 only have "estimated" National IQs, so the number of directly measured countries is 50, which matches the claim. Further, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea do have the highest values in the list. The source of the National IQs are not derived in this document however. Dr Voracek references another study for the data: Lynn, R., & Vanhanen, T. (2002). IQ and the wealth of nations. Westport, CT: Praeger From the Google book preview, I can confirm that this book does have the National IQ chart for 81 countries. Apparently is calibrated to have the UK at 100. However, I cannot see the methods used (Appendix I), so I cannot comment on its validity. 

Biographer and fellow mathematician Winfried Scharlau wrote an article "Who is Alexander Grothendiek" [Originally published in German as “Wer ist Alexander Grothendieck?” in the Annual Report 2006 of the Mathematics Research Institute.] While describing Grothendiek's early studies, he says: 

Note the vaguaries of "share the same dream environment". If both dreams were identical, I would concede this would be evidence for the paramormal. But if all this means is both dreams involve a house, it can be explained by more prosaic reasons. They elaborate further on this point themselves, later. They then introduce the concept (the main subject of the site) of "lucid dreamer" who can deliberately modify the outcome of their dreams. 

They received replies from 26 forces. All of them, apart from the Metropolitan Police (i.e. Scotland Yard) varied from "No, we don't use them.", "No, we are not aware of using them," to "No, the information we have received from them has been no value." They received two from Scotland Yard. The first stated: 

Please add any additional examples here If your answer is merely another example of a backdoor, please add it to this answer rather than hiding other approaches in the noise. This answer has been marked Community Wiki; I am not getting any reputation for it. 

But what are the actual risks from these doses? (Note: Some of these studies are dated - I would expect that modern technology, the amount of radiation required has been reduced and the ability to treat the malignancies has improved, making these over-estimates of the current risk levels.) 

In summary, the report's findings were mangled by the journalist who wrote the quoted Digital Universe article. It may or may not be true that Mormons can distinguish other Mormons from non-Mormons based on skin texture, but, as of 2010, there was no scientific evidence of it. 

I interpret the claim to not be about how responsive a particular recipient could be, but to be about how long it took to deliver a letter, and how often this service ran. i.e. if the recipient was attentive, and quick to respond, how long would it take for a response to be delivered? The Dictionary of Victorian London includes a number of quotes from contemporary sources about the London Postal service. One source from 1844 shows that there are seven deliveries daily "in town", and they were collected every two hours: 

A different study looks at weightloss (for the overweight and obese, who, presumably are the target audience of the adverts.) 

You asked at just the right time. New research has just been published to help settle this age-old question. 

No, this is not quite true. The factoid is based on a real, peer-reviewed scientific study, that is relatively new. Probability of an Obese Person Attaining Normal Body Weight: Cohort Study Using Electronic Health Records, American Journal of Public Health, September 2015, Vol 105, No. 9, doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2015.302773 They based their evidence on looking at nine years of medical records of adults in the UK, from 2004-2014. 

There are two factors I would love to learn more about with this prospective study. 1) Were the "blinded" nurses taking the pain scores the same nurses responsible for cleaning up the ice-cream off the faces of the smaller children? 2) Were the children who did NOT receive ice-lollies familiar with the standard protocol (i.e. tonsillitis = lots of ice-cream)? Was there a nocebo effect, where the control group were upset about the lack of expected ice-cream? 

In conclusion: Hypnotherapy might be helpful for smokers and obesity. There isn't enough quality evidence for obesity, and there isn't enough consistency between different studies for smoking, to be entirely sure. In the meantime, there are more trustworthy intervention techniques for obesity, and plenty of competing techniques for stopping smoking. There is little reason to trust adverts from hypnotherapists promising good results. 

Feild conducted surveys of many men (n=528), many women (n=528), many police officers (n=258), many female counsellors from a rape crisis centre (n=118) and a small number convicted rapists in a mental hospital (n=20). Note: This was back in 1978. Society's opinions about women and rape have changed a lot in the past 30-odd years [Ref: Segal and Stermac (1985), that I will introduce further below]. The surveys asked a number of questions about their attitude to rape, and they were processed to give each person a score along a number of axes. That is, each person was given a rating according to a number of factors: 

Is there any research to demonstrate the Gruen Transfer is a real thing? Is it just pseudoscience from architects and mall-designers, claiming tired and frustrated customers as a success criteria? 

Remember that, $1,000 worth of $20 notes is five times more notes that $1,000 worth of $100 notes. From this table we can see that when it comes to higher-quality "circular" counterfeits, the $100 notes dominate, even after multiplying five. For the lower quality forgeries, there are more $20 notes, but they don't add up to as much value as the $100 notes. Adding both groups together, the $100 notes win when it comes to count and value. 

Delamere FM, Sladden MJ, Dobbins HM, Leonardi-Bee J, Interventions for alopecia areata, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2008, Issue 2. Art. No.: CD004413. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004413.pub2 So, this study has been criticised for a number of reasons and dismissed. My conjecture that the oils themselves (and not their aromas) might have some effect is not supported by evidence. Aromatherapy as a safe and effective treatment for the management of agitation in severe dementia This is the study that got me excited, because I couldn't see any immediate flaws myself. It's a small study, so I went to the Cochrane Collaboration to see how it fit in with other studies in the area. Cochrane are a highly respected organisation that do meta-analyses, examining all the published studies in an area to review their methods and to pool their data. In 2003, (and still up-to-date as of 2008), they published a short review on the topic of aromatherapy and dementia.
