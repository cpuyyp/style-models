This is a pretty broad question so I'll limit myself to describing one instance of how the radius of the Earth is measured. Specifically, I'll talk about how it's measured today, with current technology. As technology has progressed, our ability to precisely measure facets of the Earth has drastically improved. At this point, we can measure the exact shape and size of the Earth to such precision that asking about the "radius of the Earth" is no longer meaningful. Primarily because we know the shape of the Earth to such precision that we know it is not a perfect sphere with a fixed radius. The current standard used to describe the exact shape of the Earth is the World Geodetic System, the latest edition of which is referred to as WGS84. In effect, this is a coordinate system centered on the Earth that precisely describes the shape of the Earth. This is done by using sensitive satellite measurements to fit the spherical harmonics to the Earth's geoid. The current, most updated version of WGS84 has more than 4.6 million harmonic terms with an accuracy in "radius" at any given point of 10 km. That is, you could pick any precise location on the Earth and use WGS84 to calculate the radius of the Earth at that exact point to an accuracy of 10 km. This radius would of course vary as you moved about the Earth. If you really want to break this down into a simple number, the WGS model, at the crudest level, considers the Earth to be an oblate spheroid with an equitorial radius of $R_{eq} = 6\:378\:137\:\mathrm{m}$ and a polar radius of $R_{p} = 6\:356\:752.3\:\mathrm{m}$. 

Again yes, we can only "see" the SBHs when they have a companion feeding them. This doesn't count the three cases where we've found SBHs through gravitational wave observations though, but all of those were far outside our galaxy. Whether a planet could exist in such a violent binary system is up for debate. There's only one known case that I know of where a planet is orbiting a similar system and that is PSR B1620-26. This is a white dwarf, pulsar pair with a planet around it. This would be completely analagous to an X-ray binary system with a black hole if only the pulsar were a bit more massive. So certainly it seems possible for a planet to be around such a system, but probably not very likely. 

By definition, it would no longer be a comet, but rather a moon (or more properly a satellite). Comets are icy bodies that orbit the Sun, satellites are any body which orbits a larger body than itself, other than the Sun. There are many examples of asteroids and comets that have been captured and become satellites, although it is not easy to prove with 100% certainty that a satellite is indeed captured and did not form in place. Some familiar (potential) examples might be Phobos and Deimos, around Mars, or the various moons around Pluto such as Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Stix. 

Basically, they can't easily figure out what's going on by looking at the SED of the high mass star forming region, so instead, they're going to look at how the gas is flowing and moving during the formation. Klassen et al. break their observations into observing "infall" and "outflow" (via two different molecular transitions). What they mean by this is that one molecular transition (that of the $J=4-3$ transition in $\mathrm{HCO^+}$ and $\mathrm{H^{13}CO^+}$ molecules) will show evidence of gas flowing into the core, i.e. infall, while another molecular transition (that of the $J=8-7$ transition in the $\mathrm{SiO}$ molecule) will show evidence of gas flowing out of the core, i.e., outflow. During star formation, you tend to get both types of flows. Infall will occur because the gas is simply accreting onto the core due to gravity. Outflow will occur because the accreting matter and central core get very hot, causing an energy release outwards. You can see precisely how they track infall flows in Section 3.2. They have a paragraph discussing precisely how they determine that the gas is falling into the core from the observations of the $\mathrm{HCO^+}$ and $\mathrm{H^{13}CO^+}$ molecules. 

Lastly, in order to use a particular catalogue to measure the BAO signal, the catalogue needs to be both deep (i.e., measures everything down to a specific redshift/magnitude limit) and wide (i.e., measures across a large field of the sky). If your catalogue doesn't meet both of these conditions, it can't be used. Clusters are easier to spot than individual galaxies. They can be found (as the Estrada et al. 2008 paper describes) by first finding the large, luminous galaxies which generally reside in the center of the cluster and are fairly easy to find. The cluster itself is then identified. Looking at individual galaxies may suffer from magnitude limiting effects or other biases, meaning that your analysis may not include all galaxies that exist at a given redshift. If that is the case, your two-point correlation function will not be accurate and you might miss or inaccurately characterize the BAO signal. I would expect this problem is mitigated by using the easier-to-identify clusters. Just to point out that cluster samples are likely to be more or less complete, the Estrada et al. 2008 paper is quoted as saying 

I suppose its certainly possible, however it's highly unlikely. First of all, you'd need your matter to fall in directly, meaning it would have to be traveling directly at the BH. Any motion slightly to the side, and it will start orbiting and spiral into the black hole. That's a pretty small target so that would already make this scenario not very plausible. However, your main problem is going to be the fact that (1) black holes have magnetic fields usually and (2) black holes also usually spin. What this means is that anything trying to get into the black hole will tend to get swept up and taken along with the rotating magnetic field, causing it to start spiraling in. You could of course say that your infalling material is neutral and thus doesn't interact with the field, but there's no way it will stay neutral all the way in. At some point friction from falling in will make it a plasma and it will then be "bound" to the magnetic field. If you're knowledgeable about your magnetic fields, you may suggest making it so this matter could simply fall into the magnetic poles as it wouldn't then wouldn't be subjected to being dragged by the magnetic field. Unfortunately, the poles tend to be the regions where material escapes from the BH so you're unlikely to get infalling material through that. In short, it might be possible to contrive some scenario where matter is just "dropped" onto the black hole but the circumstances for such an event to occur are exceedingly rare and will likely be ruined if the black hole is either spinning or has a magnetic field (which almost all do). 

The fountain will always line up with the Sun during the equinox. The precession of the Earth's axis will not change this fact. What it will change is exactly when the equinox happens. However, the fountain doesn't care about when the equinox occurs, only that it does and when it does happen, it will be pointed at the Sun. The equinox is simply the precise point in time when the Earth's axis is neither leaning towards or away from the Sun, but rather leaning along it's direction of travel. There are many analgous definitions of the equinox, but the main point here is that the equinox is simply a specific orientation of the Earth's tilt with respect to the Sun. So long as the Earth is in that specific state, the equinox will occur and the fountain will line up with the Sun. As I said though, the precession may cause the date of the equinox to drift over time. 

Galaxy clusters on the other hand are not gravitationally bound to other galaxy clusters! This means any peculiar motion a cluster has is simply its general motion through space. Since the fingers of god are a result of orbital peculiar motion, it stands to reason that galaxy clusters will not have such a motion and as such clusters won't produce these fingers of god. You'll find that more or less, the peculiar motion of clusters will simply move cause them to be randomly re-positioned without any real "structure" that you see in the fingers of god for galaxies. 

The only caveat to the above approach is that pulsars can "glitch". Normally the pulse rate decays smoothly, but every once in a while a pulsar might just glitch and quickly change pulse rates. It is unclear exactly why these glitches occur and they're unpredictable so you have to make the assumption that your pulsar hasn't glitched between now and whatever time you're in. If it has, your time may be off wildly. To mitigate this, you should of course use as many pulsars as you can find. If one pulsar gives a different number than the rest, you can assume it glitched and throw it out. The second case is more tricky. Now I'm going to assume you're in a time really distant from our own. Millions or possibly billions of years away from now. In that case, any hope in finding a precise time (or even a precise year) is wildly presumptuous. At best, you can figure out your general time within the universe by measuring the current age of the universe. We currently know the age to be $13.799\pm 0.021\ \mathrm{billion\ years}$ based on the latest and greatest measurements. You can see our uncertainty is down to 21 million years. If you make similar measurements of the Universe's age in your time, then the best you'll be able to do is define your time with respect ours with an accuracy of ~20 million years. But if you're a billion years in the future, that's a pretty good measurement in my opinion. 

What this means is that no matter where you are in the Universe, be it on Earth or in a galaxy far far away, the universe will appear to look the same to you in every direction you look. If this principle is true, it implies something very important about our universe: There is no "special" location in the Universe which distinguishes it from the rest of the Universe. If the universe was expanding from a single point due to an explosion, that point of expansion would be the center of the universe and thus hold a special significance. If you were at that point, you'd know it. Any observations at that point would clearly look different than if you were anywhere else in the Universe. If the Cosmological Principle is true, that point can't exist. If someone really spends the time to think about it, this isn't a great reason as to why we know space itself is expanding (Phiteros' answer is the great reason). What I'm basically saying is, I'm making up a principle that says there can't be a center of the universe and if that principle is true, the center of the universe can't exist. It's a little tautological, but there is good evidence that the Cosmological Principle is true. We've performed large scale observations of the distribution of galaxies and matter throughout our universe and the evidence shows that on large scales, the universe does indeed appear to be homogeneous and isotropic. 

What this means for your question is that you can look at the composition of a given satellite and determine if that composition matches what we'd expect for an object forming at that location. If for example, you see a satellite around Saturn which has a lot of Iron and very little ice and methane, you can likely presume it formed closer in to the Sun and was captured by Saturn (how this might happen, I don't know but its just a simple example). In fact, the Moon's nearly identical composition to the Earth is a strong indicator that our Moon formed in place (and from debris from Earth) rather than being captured. Now of course measuring composition is no easy feat. You can determine something like that by analyzing any emissions the planet produces (such as with the water plumes from Europa) or else by flying a satellite very close to the body and measuring gravitational effects. Cratering This is a less reliable method, but can be telling. The number and distribution of craters on a body tells us a lot about its history. If we assume that the surface of a given satellite is not constantly changing (through some geological process) then the craters on the surface represent a record of past interactions with that satellite. One approach I can imagine is to statistically predict the number of craters that should exist on the body given that it formed at its current position, then compare to what we see. If the surface hasn't been changed for billions of years, then a difference in the expected cratering indicates the body hasn't formed in the way we thought it might and possibly formed elsewhere or under different conditions. I admit though that this method is much less telling and more of a guess than using composition. 

It seems to me that you're mostly asking about star naming conventions, which is unfortunately a difficult thing to master because there are many many conventions. What makes this process difficult is that the conventions you seem to be referencing don't come from Hipparcos at all. Likely you're seeing the names of these stars as they're referred to by some other, more popular convention. I'll try to go through the things you have listed and describe how those conventions work. Hipparcos Names A star in the Hipparcos catalogue is given a number. That number is preceded by HIP and you cite a good example of HIP 36623. The number itself is more or less meaningless for the star. Some catalogues provide numbers to stars based on their RA and/or Dec, but for the Hipparcos catalogue the number is the same as the that in the Hipparcos Input Catalog (all HIP stars were pre-chosen for observation and defined in an Input Catalog). The star entries are, with a few exceptions, ordered by increasing HIP number, which basically follows the order of the object's right ascension (Equinox J2000) independent of declination. You can find a pretty good list of Hipparcos variable conventions on this page. Bayer Convention You also cite the names Delta Orionis and Omicron Puppis. These names come from the Bayer naming convention. The general scheme for this convention is to group stars by the constellation they're in. Then you rank all of them by brightness. You give each star a name which includes a Greek letter then the Latin name of the constellation it exists in. The brightest star is alpha (equivalent to A), the next brightest beta (equivalent to B), then gamma (equivalent to C), and so on. There is a convention about what to do once you've run out of Greek letters, but honestly, I've never seen anyone use the Bayer convention for such stars. It's generally only used for the brightest stars in a constellation. From the examples you gave, Delta Orionis is the 4th brightest star in the Orion Constellation (since delta is the fourth letter in the Greek alphabet). For Omicron Puppis, that's the 15th brightest star in the Puppis constellation. In this convention, you can sometimes see the greek letter written as a Greek letter, rather than spelled out, and occasionally the constellation name is shortened. Thus, for your examples, you might see them written as $\mathrm{\delta}$ Ori and $\mathrm{\omicron}$ Pup. Note that lower-case Greek letters are used (first), not upper case. Variable Star Type Designations Variable stars are complex and come in many many different flavors. As such, there's a whole slew of different names and schemes to be used when referring to a variable star. A good reference site is the International Variable Star Index page. You can refer here to answer most of your questions, but I'll post the descriptions of the non-alphabetic characters. 

I'm sure I could go on and on, but hopefully you can see there are more than a few holes in your idea. No offense, but it takes years and years of studying to contribute to the forefronts of science. Ground-breaking ideas aren't going to be had by someone who read about a few concepts from Wikipedia or A Brief History of Time and decided they could come up with a better theory. That's the academic equivalent to reading about the rules of (American) football and deciding you can play in the NFL. 

Of course, only continued observation will really be able to convince us that a gas giant doesn't exist. 

It seems they're currently using Kepler and Spitzer and plan to use Hubble in the near future as well as JWST after it launches. 

Without more information about the specific nature of the fits file, my immediate guess is that you're using a file that has already been corrected for things like bias and flat fielding. It is true that for a simple exposure (what we might call the "science" image), the fits image should have only positive values as each pixel is a (proxy) count of how many photons hit it and how can you have a negative number of photons hit your detector? But often astronomers need to clean up their science image from various sources of noise. One such example is cleaning it with a bias frame. A bias frame is an exposure with the shutter closed and the exposure time set to zero. Essentially you just pull the signal from the CCD without taking a picture. In a perfect world, the CCD will be blank and empty and there will be nothing to read out if you never exposed, but in the real world things are messy and you have lingering electrons all over the place. Reading a bias frame allows you to get some estimate of this noise that can inherently exist in a CCD. An astronomer will then take this bias frame and subtract it from the science image to remove this noise, but of course this can result in your science image having negative pixel values. This usually isn't a problem though. This resource looks pretty comprehensive about the basics of cleaning science frames.
