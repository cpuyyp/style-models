Can anyone recommend some not-overly-technical books dealing with Von Neumann Universal Constructors and similar minimalist replicating "machines" from a general philosophical or even socio-cultural perspective. What I find tends to be technically pigeonholed under computing, logic, cellular automata, or biology. I am seeking broader discussions of the processes, problems, and paradoxes entailed by "copying" or "reproducing" in the abstract, and I lack a background in formal logic. Casting the net wide, I admit. I won't know exactly what I want until I see it. 

Yes and yes. Certainly many subsequent philosophers have pointed out "major flaws" in the Critique of Pure Reason and in Kant's assumptions generally. Fichte and Hegel disputed his use of the "thing-in-itself," Moore, Russell, and many in the Anglo-American camp brutally repudiated his "outmoded" idealism. Much of modern philosophy would say that his idea of "universal" categories lacks realism, history, evolution, and any sense of cultural relativism. He is sometimes regarded as the very model of overweening Enlightenment values, imposing a static Eurocentric view upon the rest of humanity. Nietzsche, many existentialists, and postmodernists regard his deontic moralism as the epitome of cold, lifeless, duty-bound Protestantism. Yet this only confirms his centrality. While his layers of idiosyncratic terminology are very frustrating and, one suspects, no longer entirely necessary, he remains of far more than historical interest. He is especially central to discussions of freedom and morality, but his turn to "transcendental critique" also remains methodologically powerful. Among those who might be called "Kantians" of a sort are Wittgenstein, Kuhn, and Rawls, to name only three. Personally, I am also interested in the line of that odd hybrid "Kantian Marxists," from Hilferding to Karatani. I certainly agree with others that secondary texts are the best approach, while working through the original. I find the Kant, A Very Short Introduction by Roger Scruton to be quite a good start, though obviously limited and debatable. And I think it worth the investment to get A Kant Dictionary by Blackwell. It gives German word origins, assuming you'll be reading in English, and helps guide one through the dense maze of Kantian terms. Finally, I would argue that one of the great virtues of grappling with Kant and his "transcendental idealism" today is that he provides a complex, nuanced, critical alternative to neuroscience, cognitive studies, AI, and other now-trending, supposedly naturalistic, approaches to human consciousness. 

Allow me to attempt a dissenting opinion. While I agree generally with all of the above observations, and find such arguments generally annoying, they can have a certain rational force in certain circumstances, and I am wondering why. First, we have two "very dumb" (pardon the technical term) interlocutors, In1 and In2 and one belief (B1). The first interlocutor proposes only B1 for both In1 and In2. The second interlocutor proposes, let's assume, a second belief B2. We now have two interlocutors and two beliefs B1 + B2 with, mutatis mutandis, equal likelihood. Now In2 proposes B1 + B2 - B1 = B2. She has effectively doubled the number of possible beliefs and then negated one. Even if she gives no good reason, In1 now has 50% less reason to believe only B1. In information terms, the number of possibilities to be rationally reduced to "certainty" has doubled. Moreover, In2 has implied that there is some blackbox "reason" for B2, assuming they are two agents "reasoning" with one another. She implies that new evidence arose as time passed. By the principle of sufficient reason, there should indeed be some "reason" for the appearance of the new belief B2. Since In1 and In2 are already "reasoning," there is a non-negligible chance that she may have some "valid reason" for the new B2. Nor is the matter of "trust" negligible or necessarily a rhetorical device. That "reason" too is unknown. But since both In1 and In2 shared B1 prior to B2, there is evidently some overlap of what they accept as "valid reasons." Hence a greater likelihood that the blackboxed "reason" may be valid. In reality, this type of underwhelming argument does work best the more information and "possible beliefs" are limited, with "young" people, say, or people with "less expertise." Hence my qualification of "very dumb" and my limitation to just two possible beliefs between equally "reasonable" people. In practice, the argument will carry scant weight in a world of infinitely many possible beliefs. We indeed quickly "grow out" of such arguments. But even where the "reason" is not given, good or bad, there is some probabilistic weight to the argument given very restricted beliefs. It is a bit like the Monty Hall paradox. All else equal (as it never is) In1 will technically improve odds in the new domain by switching to B2. 

I doubt there is any crossover whatsoever. Nietzsche's breakdown was in 1889. Marx died in England in 1883, and was not at all the most prominent socialist of that time. Engels completed Capital in 1894 and "Marxism" only emerged in distinct contrast to other variants of socialism and anarchism around the turn of the century. What they shared in their views of history, attacks on bourgeois culture, abhorrence of British mechanics, and inheritance of German romanticism is mainly zeitgeist and retrospective selection on the part of later thinkers. Whatever they shared as atheists, they were in wholly different denominations in respect to god's replacement...Culture. 

Certainly we think first of Plato's Cave when envisioning a world of illusion, a phenomenological prison. But the famous cave metaphor does not entail an intentional deception with some rational agency behind it, as with Descartes Demon or Althusser's state idealogical apparatus. On the other hand, the political structure of the Republic itself does requires a guardian class of "philosopher kings" with a highly developed level of mathematical reason, a social myth based on the noble lie, and a relative lack of self-interest apart from their own reproduction. Computers could qualify. Yet Plato's rulers retain their moral allegiance to the citizens, the welfare of the state, and the Good. In the Matrix the class division has become logically antithetical and utterly predatory, the rulers operate logically to increase their power by the total appropriation of the vital forces reproduced in humans. A "police" boundary of alienation, terror, and ignorance separates the two classes. The ruling class acts as a continuous unity, while the ruled are helplessly encased in their discrete bodies. Thus, a radical technological extrapolation of humanist Marxism and "culture industry" critique might be the better analogy. And of course, movies like the Matrix play their own role in this ideology. By equating Plato's socialist hypothesis of the just state with demonic totalitarianism, they promote a libertarian "heroic" ideal that fits all too well into the benighted individualism of the commodity system. So indeed, as Plato warns, beware the dramatists tugging on heartstrings. 

While I am no Kant scholar, my understanding is that the noumenon or thing-in-itself (which are not exactly the same, but close enough) might best be defined as "a shadowy object of heated scholarly controversy, refutation, and resuscitation." The main divide seems to be whether they are treated as ontologically distinct from phenomena (for example, as a "cause" or ground) or as a "way of thinking about" an object. Gerold Prauss and Henry Allison are among the many scholars who prefer this rendering and treat "ding an sich" as a shortening of "ding an sich selbst betrachtet." Thing considered as it is in itself. The necessity then arises from the idea that we are already considering the thing under conditions of sensibility as, in some way, an "appearance" organized into related appearances, thus always suggesting another way it might be considered, i.e., apart from this condition. Why bother? Because, I would guess, Kant is interested in the "conditions of sensibility," which must be studied by a sort of triangulation between "appearances" and that aspect of the thing which is "not an appearance." On this interpretation, which makes sense to me, the main mistake would be to think of the noumenal as ontologically privileged or "more real." To me it seems precisely the point of Kant's "critical" method that we drop the whole idea of things being "more real" or "less real." However, I don't think Kant's treatment lends itself to clear agreement on this, especially in the case of the self and its freedom. That said, I'm not sure what to make of the quote. I'm not sure how the "archetypal" and "ectypal" distinctions relate, and the reference to glimpses of "concrete ultimate reality" sounds more Platonic than Kantian. Or as if we were glimpsing the object's "deeper reality," like the submerged hindquarters of a mermaid. 

This is a very good question, one that brings metaphysics to life. Unfortunately, I do not have a good answer, though I've tried to think about it. While Cort Ammon and others have given good definitional answers, these are more about the "nature of axiomatic systems," while I suspect what is wanted is more along the lines of, what is a straight line "really?" A few false starts. First, a straight line is the "fastest speed." For this is simply another way of saying that it is the "shortest distance" between two points. So the speed of light "C" is physically the "straightest" line. We use it to define the meter. But in physical reality, the linear extension of light, if we may think of it as such, refracts in innumerable mediations. And does so universally through the "lens" of gravitation. Second, on our apparently spherical planet it came as a slow-moving shock to modern humans to discover that if you travel in a "straight line" away from, say, Lisbon, you will get further and further away. Eventually, when you are as far away as possible, you will find that you have returned to Lisbon! But from the "other side." The Lisbon your ships left returns as the "end of the straight line" backwards, in reverse. The non-Euclidean "straight line" or "great circle." Third, just as the "shortest distance" is the "fastest speed" it is also the "least possible difference." The least "distance" entails two "stances" or "instantiations" or "points." A "dif-ference" is related to the root word for "ferry." To go straight back and forth. The fastest ferry is the least difference. And the shortest route or distance, or "straightest line." Fourth, a physicist (can't remember which one) said that if we had only thought more carefully about the ambiguous definition of a "point" we would never have been surprised by quantum paradoxes. Our instinct is to think additively. A good corrective to this is information theory, in which knowledge increases by the elimination of "uncertainty." A Hegelian "negation of negation." Fifth, To expand on the fourth point. We live in "three dimensional" volumes. Scare quotes because we should distrust our axiomatic concepts of "dimension."Two volumes intersect to form a plane. A plane is the intersection or "mutual elimination" of two volumes. A plane is the least thing we can see or imagine. A "line" is the intersection or "mutual limitation" of two planes.A point is the mutual limitation of two lines. And what is the intersection of two points? A circle? An "oscillation?" Sorry, I am posting as is. Utterly incomplete. Only because I was dissatisfied with the "axiomatic" answers. There is more to it... and the question deserves better. What "are" the Euclidean entities we so readily intuit? I hope this will prompt better answers, and I will edit this mess of an answer as soon as I can. 

Yes, generally speaking, the "scientific method" could be approached epistemologically. Epistemology, simply put, concerns how we know things and how we can validate judgements. It is one of the main branches of "metaphysics," along with ontology (what things exist), logic (correct analysis of propositions), and ethics (correct practices). Certainly, epistemology would play a central role in a philosophical inquiry into the scientific method. A good example is how we deal with instrumentation. Strange as it might seem now, there were arguments in Galileo's day about what exactly one was seeing through a telescope. Obviously it is a distortion. So, is the very different appearance of the moon "more real" or "less real"? How can we interpret those shadowed crinkles as mountains? However, epistemology as a field is rather broad, not limited to science, and practicing scientists are not overly concerned with it. I would not start out looking under "epistemology" in the card catalogues or databases. You are better off starting out directly with introductions to the philosophy and history of science. I stress "history" because this is actually one of the better ways to understand how the scientific method has been understood and how it has evolved in history. Some key historical moment would be Francis Bacon's original case for empirical verification and the "inductive" method, later institutionalized in the Royal Society. Here we have the basis of direct observation and publicly demonstrable "experiment," as developed by Galileo and many others. There ensued a veritable mania for cataloging, experimenting, demonstrating, and recording often with very little in the way of overall theory about what science was actually doing. Next, I would look at the fascinating literature surrounding Newton's theory of gravity, momentous yet more controversial than we now recall. Here the role of mathematics takes central stage. And Newton's enormously decisive step in demonstrating how this invisible thing or "force" he names "gravity" works, while refusing to say what it is. To many scientists of his day this "gravity" looked like today's quantum entanglement or "spooky action distance," a dangerous slide back into metaphysics. Yet it worked. In this way, by simply ignoring ontology, Newton liberated physics from metaphysics by division. Or at least partially. From this point, we get into issues of induction, causation, evidence, etc., and Popper's highly influential description of scientific method as induction and falsification. Science can never absolutely prove what is true, but only falsify what is not. A process of hypothetical, public conjecture and refutation. While oversimplified, this is a crucial distinction often lost upon the public. After Popper come those "post-modern" turns that are both sociological and more overtly epistemological, viewing science as a kind of social consensus that can radically evolve and perhaps has no fixed standard. Kuhn and Feyerabend are the best known names is this then "radical" reevaluation of the many "methods" used by scientists. Of course, many other names, such as Hempel, Carnap, or Sellars, have much to say about scientific method. In terms of "educated in epistemology" certainly it doesn't hurt. But the issues implied in your question may have more to do with a good general understanding of scientific method...and then a grasp of statistics and probability, which are so often misunderstood in evaluating an publicizing findings, even by scientists. Epidemiology is a good topic here. The literature is vast, so just googling should lead to many relevant works. My only possibly "unique" suggestion is not to neglect the history, for with each great theoretical shift, from Newton to Darwin to Maxwell to Einstein, "scientific method" also changed. One addendum. Remember, because others will say otherwise, that studying "the scientific method" is both history and metaphysics. Many philosophers of science dismiss "metaphysics." But to say, for example: "Physics is our best method of understanding reality" is not a statement provable by physics. It is a metaphysical statement. 

I am reminded of Sartre's famous key-hole observer suddenly discovering himself being observed, suffusing the subject with shame and a kind of objectifying "mortification." I know this is not what you had in mind, but I raise it in order the reintroduce the missing aspect of awareness and psychology in these inanimate "particle" observers, these Disney "atoms" with cartoon eyes. While I too am fascinated by questions of symmetry and measurement and value metaphor, I simply fail to understand the definition of "observe" here. It is either metaphorical or collapses a meaningful distinction to little avail. Why is "observe" an accurate description of this relation between particles? Certainly, we can might say that a "measurement" takes place in the purely physical sense that information is transferred between particles. Such a transfer is not necessarily reversible. I believe it is, in fact, physically irreversible. So these perspicacious "particles" do not necessarily observe one another, at least not with equal "accuracy." But again, I can only take this as useful metaphor.The physical, particulate information has syntax, but no semantics. I see no gain in a massive, gratuitous reduction of what we normally call "observation" of an object by a "conscious subject" to a physical, mechanical relation between two objects under the same term. And I tend to agree with the unpronounceable commenter that the subject cannot be an object to itself, just as we can never actually see our own face, only its reverse. While we can approach the imaginative ideal of subject-object identity, the distinction can never be meaningfully collapsed. They remain, as it were, inside-out or chiral to one another.
