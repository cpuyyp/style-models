(I am ignoring the science-based tag, I don't think there is any science done on this subject) I assume you would fix all maps, all encyclopedias, all newspapers, all holiday photos and everything else. There would be A LOT of references to fix. Many companies would suddenly find themselves without suppliers, customers or both. A multinational company has its administration hub that would suddenly find itself without anything to administrate. Tourist guides wouldn't understand anything. And so on. The immediate consequences would be vast and destructive. People would wonder if they were insane, only be comforted by the fact that lots of other people seem insane too. And then there would be the food problem. It would vary wildly from country to country. Many countries would face severe problems because they import much of their food. Others would have the smaller problem of suddenly having too much food. We also export and import other products, such as oil and natural gas. Lots of power plants would stop working for lack of supplies. Oil pipelines would rupture at the border and start polluting. And nobody would know why! In the longer term, many countries would find themselves without cars, or clothes, or medicines, or lots of other imported goods. And others would have enormous stockpiles of these things. The Moon would crash into a force field and fall down Wait, that is not right. The Moon is above geostationary orbit. Instead a force field would crash into the Moon and force it away from the Earth. Depending on how the force field is anchored this could end badly for both the Moon and the Earth. As a rule of thumb, smaller countries are more dependent on others than larger ones, so they would be harder hit. The US, Russia and China would probably do fairly well, at least compared to the worst disaster areas. There are undoubtedly many exceptions to this general rule. But all things pass. Enough people die that the country can feed itself, industries spring up to replace imports and so on. Eventually things will be fairly normal. There would be vast militaries that would wonder why they exist, and would try to find some purpose in life. Many places would become military dictatorships. Others would devolve into civil wars. Even this will pass. Civil wars will wither be won or end in a set of smaller countries. Militaries will downsize into ordinary government and police forces. In the chaotic years, there will not be any advances in technologies or other things. Afterwards, progress will be slower than today for two reasons. First is that the war industry is one of the forces behind new technology. There are also other forces, but they are weaker. The second reason is that good ideas spread out and cause other good ideas. The more people in a community, the more ideas get invented and shared. Smaller countries might end up with no progress at all. 

Unfortunately, if you put two or more of these devices next to each other, they will interfere. Not only is this a problem for scaling up bandwidth, but also allows jamming of messages you don't want an enemy to send/receive. Minimum safe distance between transceivers is up to you, just be consistent about it. It might also be a problem only on the sending or receiving side. "The brave hero sneaks into the palace grounds disguised as a gardener. While replanting a bush she also buries a small box under its roots. Later a timer activates it and communication becomes impossible. The communication officer can tell the emperor that the box is somewhere on the east side of the palace, but actually finding it takes a long search. Meanwhile, the communication crew is relocated to the top of the west tower, trying to listen for messages in the noise." 

Life as we know it started in water. Since then it has adapted to all sorts of conditions, but in the beginning it was complete dependent on water to survive. So, make a planet that is much drier than ours. No oceans, few lakes. Life as we know it will not develop. We don't know if there are other forms of life that might appear in these circumstances, but you can easily say that "Well, it didn't happen here anyway." without anybody saying you are wrong. IMPORTANT: The rest of this answer is scientifically wrong. Leaving it here as a warning to others. See comments for details. As others have been saying, a life-less planet wouldn't have free oxygen, so you need some terraforming. Fortunately this is easy. Just spread plant seeds around! You will probably need to engineer a plant for the purpose, since the desert species we have don't grow very quickly. But hey, this is science fiction, your bio engineers will have know exactly how to sequence the perfect gene sequence for a plant that does the job. Of course, when the plants have done their job, they will have converted all the CO$_2$ and they might starve and die. It is tempting at this point to assume that some of the plants would die and rot, releasing CO$_2$ back into the atmosphere, creating a cycle. Unfortunately, things don't rot on their own. You need bacteria for that. So please remember to seed some of those too. Otherwise you might get fires, which will also release CO$_2$ but will generally be nasty in other ways. Right, so you have oxygen. Time to add colonists! They are likely to establish their colony on the shore of one of the few lakes there is since humans are still pretty dependent on water. Time for you to make a decision: Is the original terraforming plant edible? If yes, people have landed in paradise. If no, they have a tough job ahead of them. The same properties that made the plant work quickly as a terraformer also makes it a bad weed. The colonists will curse the short-sighted engineers who were only looking at the short term. At this point somebody will suggest releasing a few herbivores, e.g. rabbits, to control the plants. Others will remember what rabbits did to Australia and say NO. 

You are the master of your world, so yes. Some practical concerns: Your guests are only three-dimensional and would like to stay that way. How do you get them from one "hyperfloor" to the next? Well, you put them in a "hyperelevator" and move the whole room across. Peasy, easy. Are there alternate Earths under the other "hyperfloors"? You can answer that question both yes and no resulting in different problems. Yes can mean problems with the natives of those worlds. No means there is no gravity on those floors. And you will have to make things completely airtight, and either import or recycle oxygen. (Or both) A related question is what is the view from the windows is like. What do you do about power failure and fire safety? The "hyperelevators" are not running, the lights are off and the guests are panicking. Your move. You need "hyperstairs". They will probably not look like ordinary stairs. The most reasonable look is a corridor that somehow starts on one hyperfloor and ends on another. Actually, you probably want something like that for water, waste and electricity too. Just problematic is that power failure anyway? The "hyperstructure" of the hotel... is it something you build once and then it is stable, or is it something that is more like a force field that need continuous power to maintain? Your choice, but in the force field scenario you will need an UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) better than the Pentagon. I am talking Tesla Batteries and Diesel Generators and Cold Fusion Generators and exercise bikes with dynamos and ... Finally, for marketing reasons you really need to find better words than "hyperwhatever". 

We Greens have to stick together to fight Blue-skins racism! In times of plenty, everybody are friends and nobody is discriminated against. Not much, anyway. In times of scarce, people start looking for scapegoats, and it is always "Them". "They" are taking all our jobs. "They" are getting all the good asteroids, leaving just the gravel to "Us". Unfortunately, something is always scarce, and "plenty" is always relative. It doesn't matter that you have a spaceship if your neighbor has two. How did he get so rich? Must be nepotism... 

Shivs, that is improvised sharp small weapons. You cannot throw or shoot anything underwater. Friction stops it very quickly. Take a sharp rock, or a shell of some sort. If it is sharp all over wrap it in something to be able to hold it. And there you have it. As technology progresses you probably want longer weapons to outreach the opponent. You can not slash underwater without expending a lot of energy, stabbing is much easier. This means spears, which is basically a shiv on a stick. However, you don't want very long spears, since they become harder to turn to face a moving opponent. A two-ended spear is a possibility, but I don't know how practical it is. You can possibly get a rock/paper/scissors situation where short spears beats shivs, and long spears beats short spears, but shivs outflanks and beats long spears. One major difference is that battles are 3-dimensional. This makes battle tactics much more complicated. The short version is that it is easier to out-flank, but harder to fully surround someone. I don't know much more than that about this, but I expect being able to outsmart the opponent will be more important than in land battles. So far, the water has been a problem, but as you say it can also be an advantage. Take a really big rock. Fasten a lot of gas bladders to it to make it float. Push it to directly above an enemy village or other target. Cut away the gas bladders. Smile.
