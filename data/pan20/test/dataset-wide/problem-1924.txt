I don't think anyone has mentioned this yet, apologies if I missed it: Many companies wish to maintain the appearance (and it might even be mostly true) that all employees are fully committed to the company and believe in what it's doing. Someone who's leaving is clearly an exception to that rule. As a matter of presentation both to clients and to other employees, the company might choose to take steps to conceal facts that don't fit the narrative. The most direct way to have everyone carry on as normal, is to restrict the information only to those who absolutely must know (the employee leaving, their boss, anyone in management above that to whom this single person is significant, someone in HR, anyone involved in replacing the exiting employee). Naturally some people think this is sensible PR, while others think it's dishonest dealing with both clients and other employees. It might even be both. 

If they are applying a 10% salary reduction across the board for cost-saving purposes, decided on after the original offer was extended, then that would at least be a genuine principled reason for doing it. They'd be treating you no worse than all their existing employees. But I can't think of a principled reason why they wouldn't tell you that's the reason, so it seems unlikely to be the case here other than for the unprincipled reason that they think you won't want to work for them if you know how bad their situation is. What I think is likely, is that they regret their original offer for some reason (maybe new information) and this is their idea of negotiation. They want another round after they think you're committed. It's unethical to renege on the original offer without an overwhelming reason that they can't honour it, and especially without explaining why. I think it's particularly unethical in that they might benefit from the fact that, to satisfy your ethics, you may well have declined other offers immediately on accepting this one. That's the sense in which they think you're now "committed": you've already discarded any such aspect of your previous negotiating position. At risk of setting up a straw man, they'd probably say it's "sharp negotiation", and that in their view it would be legitimate to do the same thing to any supplier -- offer a lower price after initial agreement in principle and before contracts. You could reasonably conclude that: it's not really legit even with a supplier since a formal offer is different from a general discussion on price; that you're not a supplier, you're a prospective employee; that you don't feel like working for someone who plans to trick you like that (or trick anybody else, for that matter); and that you can't put your faith in a company so immature that it thinks antagonising its employees before day 1 is a smart move. 

In the UK you're unlikely to be summarily fired for not attending a team-building event on a day booked as annual leave. At least, provided you've been there at least 2 years. Clearly what your boss should have done is refused the leave at the point you booked it, saying that this event is essential and so leave cannot be given. As such, I think you can afford to assert that you have some choice here, and you are going to choose not to go to the event. You "communicate with your boss that you do not want to go to this social event" by saying you don't intend to go. This is what conveys that you're serious. It's not up to your manager whether you go, it's up to them what the consequences are for not going. They're very unlikely to fire you on the spot just for saying you don't intend to go. They might threaten to fire you if you don't show up (in which case at least you know where you stand), and they might try to get you into some kind of ongoing "plan" to involve you in more social events in future. You can judge them by what they decide. Since you're willing to quit over this (albeit you'd prefer not to), your position is reasonably strong. Talk it out, and if the measures are not to your liking then you can walk. If this really is a hard requirement for the role, "must go rafting", then they've learned a lesson to put it in the job description, and you need to find a job that doesn't involve rafting. If it's not a hard requirement then hopefully you can reach an agreement with your boss under which you don't do it. Beware that if you're not taking part in "team-building events" in general, then your relationships with others in the company will be scrutinised, because it's something your boss evidently thinks is really important and that you aren't visibly doing. That doesn't necessarily mean your boss won't accommodate you, but it's certainly a worrying sign because you'll never make this boss entirely comfortable about your role in the team. The fact that you only have to engage with two colleagues isn't really relevant if your boss prefers the whole team to go out on the lash together and can't see past your choice not to join in. There are plenty of bosses for whom showing up and cheerfully doing your work is enough, but this boss isn't one of them. 

There's no universal dress code. Different companies, departments, and even individual managers will have ideas what they require. "Very casual dress code" might sound like it means "wear what you like", but it probably doesn't, it really means "dress a certain amount of scruffy". If you have no scruffy clothes, then strange as it sounds you might have to go out of your way to achieve that. It's just the way it is, managers want the workplace to look a certain way. However the industry as a whole does have certain styles that it expects to see, and others that it doesn't. Jeans and T-shirt isn't just what many programmers happen to want to wear because they're used to dressing that way in college (and for that matter as children). It's also a specific style that's on the list of those expected, as is "business casual", but for example "evening formal wear" isn't, other than for certain events. If you happen to want to wear an unexpected style then you'll stand out, for better or worse. Also bear in mind that your manager raised it as you left the internship. It's his advice to you. If it was the dress code he required from you then he'd have mentioned it at the start. That's also why there's no inconsistency between him giving you this advice while being unconcerned about the dude in the dress. Maybe if he was in a position to give that dude career advice, he'd advise different clothes. Maybe he has given that advice and the dude chose to ignore it, we don't know. But your internship manager certainly is in a position to advise you what to wear, and for that matter how to act in the workplace in a whole bunch of different ways, because that's what internship managers do, they mentor you somewhat. You should probably take what you were told at face value. You should pay some attention to what you wear to work, and you should decide how "young" and how "professional" you want to dress. He thinks you're dressing too young and not professional enough for your own good. He might be right or wrong, but that's for you to judge because he's not talking about merely meeting the dress code, he's talking tactics. Your safest bet in any workplace is to dress the same way slightly more experienced people in similar roles dress. In a software role this is unlikely to be expensive or difficult to maintain, but it's true that you might be hot in summer. If you're going to spend anything, then some lightweight trousers might be a good investment. If you want to progress swiftly to management, then as depressingly shallow as it sounds, dressing a bit more like the managers will probably help somewhat. As you can see from another answer, if you look too "sexy" then some colleagues, both male and female, will assume that you're (a) stupid, (b) giggly, and (c) there to be exploited. I don't know whether or not your idea of "cute" matches their idea of "sexy", you might be safe on this score. But one of the first things you must do when you start paying attention to what you wear, is to figure that out, because regardless of how unfair (even unlawful) such prejudices are, they exist. You do not want to be slut-shamed in the workplace, because contempt (even though totally undeserved) is the opposite of respect. 

Unfortunately employers do not give you the option of saying, "I am not currently able to do my job and I am not comfortable telling you why". You have to seriously consider how you are going to work around these issues, because you're past the point where you'll get much special consideration if you raise them now. Even if it's a somewhat-protected issue like sickness or disability, you have a credibility problem by only mentioning it after a protracted period of under-performance and a written warning. I'm sorry that your relationship with your boss is this bad that you haven't had any opportunity to explain or mitigate these problems before they added up to a written warning, but there it is. He's unlikely to trust any explanation you give now. 

As long as you do the job you were hired for, and the role has value, it doesn't matter whether you're the most senior programmer, the most junior programmer, the CEO, or the under-janitor. They pay you to do what you do. You can expect in time to progress to more senior roles. If it's at the same company then they will replace you, with a new junior, when they promote you. 

Seems normal to me that someone only a month into learning a new language will be slow with it, even given that they know other languages. Seems normal to me that anyone at any level will occasionally ask questions that are just common sense to their colleagues. People overlook things, and at least asking is better than getting it wrong. You should: 

Work the plan like a job application. You've been told to make certain changes (like a job application has essential and desirable criteria), the plan must tick off each change with at least one and preferably more specific things that you will do achieve that change. Some of them look pretty easy, "I am not communicating my whereabouts properly". So you need to inform your boss without fail of your location during working hours, including when working at home. Part of this might just be communicating your schedule, "today I will be away from my desk between 10:30 - 11:45 at meeting X and 2:30 - 3:00 for a discussion at Y's desk. I will take lunch at 12:30". I work from home full-time and it's convenient to flex hours, "oh, I'll take 15 minutes to put some laundry on and make it up later". Don't do this, you'll appear unresponsive if anyone IMs you or whatever. Sit at your desk and stay sat. In the office, arrive to work on time and leave late. Record the times you arrive and leave at each end of the day and either side of lunch. Some of them look quite hard to make a plan for, "regain your boss's trust". Remember that goals need to be SMART, so you're looking for steps you can take with measurable outcomes that show trust has been regained. You might need to ask your boss what he would take as signs that he has started to trust you again. Documenting the work you produce while at home would be something. Giving up that day working at home is probably what he wants, you have to make a call whether you'll do that. Don't say that you've "allegedly" lost the trust of your team-mates. Clearly you think you haven't but your boss and HR don't care for your opinion on the subject. For the purpose of the exercise just pretend you have, and come up with something you can do to objectively show that you've "regained" their trust. 30 days later they're all providing evidence that they trust you, although I'm not sure what form that evidence would take -- testimonials? Examples of them leaving you with vital tasks to complete? Whatever it is, if they do in fact trust you then collecting it isn't the problem, thinking of what it should be is. If your team-mates do in fact trust you (and your boss trusts them), then build you plan so that they provide supporting evidence on as many points as you can (without asking them to take significant time over it, of course, since you don't want your boss to see you as distracting others). They are the witnesses to everything you do right. I think the "actively taking part in meetings" thing is a minefield. Now you have to speak up in meetings, but if your boss really is hostile towards you that gives him plenty of opportunities to shoot you down. Not knowing anything about your meetings I don't know what to say on this other than, work out what you're supposed to do in meetings, write down that you'll do it, but try not to overdo it and avoid any conflict in the meetings. Motivation is tricky. "Yes, within 30 days I will love my job that has me on special measures and I will especially love my boss who now has me in line of sight all day because he thinks I lie to him about whether I'm working or not". I'm not exactly in favour of just lying to cover this point, but I fear you might have to. Don't tell a lie that can be objectively determined false by anyone else. Your thoughts are your own, so "being motivated" is not really distinguishable from "appearing motivated". Your task is to appear motivated whilst calling it "being motivated". "I'm highly motivated by the fear of being sacked" might be true but it's not what your employer is thinking when they say they want highly-motivated workers. Or even if it is they wouldn't admit it. "Not being accountable for my responsibilities" is vague, but look at your job description and any less-formal descriptions of your responsibilities and find out which ones are problems. If you really are failing to meet vital responsibilities then regardless of the reason, in point of fact you are unreliable. Maybe you're unreliable for a very good reason, and your boss is being unfair not to sympathise with that. But the fact remains that the business can't rely on you if you aren't getting everything done. So you need to get on top of that.
