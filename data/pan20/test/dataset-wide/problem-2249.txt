While this doesn't specifically mention the bar-headed goose, I think it can apply under sections of the above sources. First, that those bar-headed geese are eating in an inland location, and, second, that the rain dance is used by other species. As for the bread feeding, the goose seems to stop the dance briefly when the bread comes. Maybe it can't dance and eat bread! Maybe it doesn't need to. That's not something I found in the research. 

I live in the central region of Massachusetts, United States. Last January we found this lovely bird eating suet in our suburban back yard. It's in a section of about ten feeders, mostly in the shade of a few evergreen trees. I've looked through my backyard bird guides and haven't seemed to find anything close enough to make a confident identification. Since it was here in January, it might be something that overwinters here. However, some migrators pass through during the winter, so that might be a wrong assumption. Also, we had unusually warm weather during January and February, so that could have thrown off a migration schedule. We don't recall having seen it before and couldn't find it in pictures of our yard in the past few years. Frequently birds this size scare smaller birds away from the suet, but that's not the case here. At first I thought it was just docile and they weren't scared, which might be true. However, I've been looking very closely at the two small ones, which are best seen in the bottom picture. They also have dark around the eyes and long skinny legs, so I wonder if this might be an adult male or female with babies who haven't grown into their adult colors. I could be completely wrong, though. It's all part of what makes bird identification difficult, and fun! Notable physical characteristics: 

I'm not asking for brands or prices. I want to know if gear like this exists, and if so, what criteria I should look for when making my choice. If there is no such thing, that's a valid answer. 

The tide was out so the pictures we took weren't as dramatic as what we actually saw last year. Hopefully they're good enough to give you an idea. (Click on them for larger view.) 

EDIT: Today, February 27, I spoke with a very kind woman at the Ohio Division of Wildlife. I told her where you live and which turtles you've seen. She said all your turtles have adapted to these changes in weather, and can go back into whatever state of hibernation is necessary to protect themselves. A full hibernation isn't always necessary, especially if it's just for a few weeks or so. Some Map turtles tend to end their hibernation earlier than the other breeds anyway. Unfortunately, if the turtles haven't sensed the weather getting colder, and are spending a lot of time out in the sun, a surprise freeze will cause them to pass away before they can get back under water. She said it's very rare, and happens quickly, so hopefully they don't suffer. Those who are deceased can be seen at the water's edge, so it's up to you if you want to look around the pond area. I can't stand to see deceased creatures, so I'd probably stay away, but I won't even step on ants, and have been called over-sensitive many times! I'd appreciate if you keep us posted, if you want to, and give us an update. I sincerely hope Mappy and his friends will be fine! 

The National Audubon Society, another world-renowned organization, also addresses the issue, especially for people who do not leave feeders up through the winter. 

There's a question on the site asking for information about foraging food in Sweden. One of the answers mentioned that any wild food can be foraged and taken from the forests of Swedish Lapland, with the exception of "protected food." What types of wild foods are considered protected in that region, meaning plants, animals, something else? Who, for example governing bodies, organizations, or individuals, decides the criteria necessary to classify wild food as protected? 

The practice of eating insects is called entomophagy. References using that term can include many insects. I've narrowed it down to ants and termites as best as I could, although some of the general advice and information include ants, termites, and other insects. The short answer is that not all ants and termites are safe to eat, but most of those you're likely to encounter, either in the woods or at home, are probably edible. That's because there are 2,000 different kinds of edible ants in the U.S., and up to 12,000 across the world. For termites, according to the National Institutes of Health-Pub Med, 45 termite species belonging to four families were recorded, and 43 of those have been used in the human diet or for feeding livestock. To be safe, many sources say that Field Guides are strongly recommended before foraging for anything, which certainly makes sense. There are different guides to choose from, all with varying reviews. I'll leave that to you to investigate. There are a few things to pay close attention to when choosing what to eat. 

My husband recently lost a pair of ear warmers he got at North Face 15 years ago. North Face no longer sells them, so I'm looking for a high-quality replacement. I'm confused by the types of materials used in construction, what they mean, and how they should factor into my purchasing decision. He had 180's®, and that's what he wants again. I'm not sure if 180's® is a brand, or just a registered style name, but since the question's about materials used, it isn't meant to be a brand request. After much online research, I've narrowed it down to three pairs that are comparably priced, and look similar to what he had. Each has these same important features: 

If you do decide to make the trip, I recommend checking out this excellent three part series called Crossing the Simpson for beginners. If you can't or don't want to drive it yourself, there are 4WD tour groups. They vary in length and areas of the desert. You can find a list here.

Kelley at Preparedness Pro published an article called Safely Preserving Eggs. She believes that the answer to your question is yes, the cartons should be gently flipped upside down about once a month. This is to preserve the integrity of the egg. She also seals them individually for the best protection and longevity. This is her opinion: 

The show Nova on Public Broadcasting Service Network interviewed a family who traveled the earth eating insects. This was taken from a discussion about eating termites in Uganda. 

If your dad complied with legal rules but not safety rules, that would have been enough to get him in trouble. Putting other boats and boaters at risk of injury just to have the adventure of sailing in a storm is a bad idea. Your suspicion that he might have been considered reckless makes sense. Also, it's disrespectful to use precious agency resources when they have more important problems to attend to during a weather event. Impounding the boat and punishing the sailor would have been appropriate. The waters surrounding Nantucket are governed by a complex combination of Federal and State jurisdiction, mostly for environmental protection reasons. A few different agencies monitor watercraft behavior. I've had some trouble locating enforcement measures for small sail boats in current times. Some sites say that agencies are frustrated when it comes to enforcement, mostly because revocation of license is the first line of defense, and small sail boats don't need to be licensed. Some infractions are just overlooked, unless they're very dangerous, or committed by repeat offenders. Even with the rules in place, impounding doesn't seem to be used as it was so many years ago. Nantucket's population has had tremendous growth in the last 50 years. The island was much less populated at the time of the incident you described, so local enforcement was probably more personally involved. The fine itself was probably for the infraction, the cost for the boat to be towed to and stored in the impound area, or both. 

It's spring here in the Northeastern United States, and we're getting a large influx of the wonderful birds who will spend the summer and fall with us. Although we feed and water birds, and any other hungry outdoor creatures, throughout the year, we increase their options during the busier months. This is also the season when merchants heavily advertise many varieties of birdbaths. I've read a number of articles saying that birdbaths with moving water are better. They suggest that moving water increases attendance, and keeps the birds, and birdbaths, healthier. For instance, this says 

Map Source It's worth noting that weather and other things cause changes to the exact route. There have been numerous times when, in order to make sure the race took place during the appointed week, changes have been made. Global warming in general has been blamed for some of the more recent changes. For instance, in 2017, the weather was so warm that it was not safe to use certain parts of the trail due to lack of sufficient snow. Therefore, the course was altered. More information, including the course for that year, can be found at The Alaska Life.

I recommend spending time at that site. It has a wealth of information about the barnacle, such as how it functions, its life history, and other interesting features. It also has a page with a map of distribution, clearly showing that it's more common in your area than pretty much anywhere else in the world! There's a graph on that page showing the history of sightings. I think it's updated constantly because it's current as of June, 2017. Since it began in August of 2014, the level stayed pretty steady until the summer of 2016, when there was a marked increase. You may have witnessed part of that, since you wrote this question in April of 2016. That site also has a good photograph collection, which shows many that are similar to your picture. I didn't post any because I'm not sure they're public domain. This was taken in Monterey in 2014. It's from the blog page of a family on vacation. You might also like this article from the San Luis Obispo Tribune, in March of 2013, entitled Barnacles and Sand Dollars. It's the story of a woman who observed an unusual increase in barnacles on sand dollars on her favorite California beaches in the area of Cayucos. It's a few hours away from Monterey, but I think it's relevant. 

Kangaroos can be very dangerous to men. It's never a good idea to approach them and we should always exercise caution when in the vicinity. However, they don't go looking for people to attack, so if you see them from afar, just enjoy them and take some beautiful pictures. They're the most aggressive under two conditions: 

You've already received excellent advice, so I'll just describe a few things we've been doing for years. Our bird baths are a distance from the house, so in addition to those, we provide water on the patio just outside the door, as you're planning to do on your balcony and terrace. For drinking, we put out shallow saucers. A convenient choice is the saucer a potted plant sits on. Some are plastic, others are ceramic, and some are just heavy-duty paper plates from the supermarket. We use a lot because, although the small birds share well, the larger types seem to prefer their own. Chipmunks and squirrels enjoy them too. (If you haven't had a close-up view of a chip or squirrel sucking up water while holding the dish with their tiny feet, you've missed something awesome! Of course, I don't know if you even have those where you live!) For bathing, a favorite of our birds is a plastic tray I use to start seedlings. It's a few inches deep; enough for the small birds to drink and bathe but not deep enough to drown. Anything like that would work. My picture on the left was taken during birdy play-time! I apologize that it's messy, but if you press on it, you'll get a larger view of them. It's too bad I don't have a video; they make a fun splashing sound! We also have a plastic bird feeder with a dome above it. It doesn't work for bathing, but the birds drink from it, and it offers a little bit of protection from the weather. It's the one from which the cardinal is eating in my picture below. In the United States, we have the opposite problem of those who deal with evaporation. During the cold winter months, our water quickly becomes little blocks of ice. Every day, sometimes twice, we dump those out and refill the dishes with warm water. Rather than bringing in all my containers, I fill up a watering can, or any pitcher I have lying around, step outside and tend to them all at once. It's quick and easy! My caution for those in colder climates is that glass dishes tend to crack in the winter, leaving jagged edges which aren't safe for the birds. Plastic can crack too, but doesn't usually break apart. Whether it's too hot or too cold, there are times when birds rely on us for their survival, and I applaud your desire to help them! 

Is the blue color scaring them away? My initial reaction to this question was that color was likely irrelevant. However, some studies show clear differences among these birds, and blue is a preferred color among sparrows, so I'd bet the blue color is not scaring them away. In fact, if you put out a blue tray or other type of feeder, you may even see more! The most in-depth studies I found were conducted in England. Results showed that given the choice of different colors, the sparrows' two favorites are green and blue, especially in summer. In the winter, some birds preferred silver, most likely because of the way they perceive color, which is different and more sophisticated than humans. Colour preferences of UK garden birds at supplementary seed feeders, published in 2017 by the U.S. National Institute of Health, is long and technical, but really fascinating. 

There are some questions regarding "minimalist shoes" on the site. By looking at those with the tag, it seems that the term relates to shoes that have thin soles without much spring to them, and sometimes laces. I assume that's not all there is to it. What is the definition of minimalist shoes, and what are the criteria necessary to meet the definition? 

This question is related to this, and perhaps others on the site, although I don't think it's an exact duplicate. I have friends who would like to take a two-person kayak trip down a stream in the White Mountains region of New Hampshire, USA, while on a vacation. The boat would be a rental from one of those places that caters to vacationers. One friend was born without arms, and therefore has no ability to hold a paddle. They're trying to figure out if they should have her sit in the front or the back. My fully-abled friend has done the same trip a few times, so she knows the terrain, but she's only ever used a single person kayak. The stream in that area is fairly level, with some curves, hills and rocks, but nothing too strenuous. It's not deep enough for capsizing to be a concern. My handicapped friend misses out on a lot of fun on vacations, because she has to wait on the sidelines while the rest of our friends go on excursions without her. That's why they've decided to rent a tandem kayak this time. It's possible that when they get there the rental place will suggest who should sit where, however, they'd like some advice before they go. Both women are about the same height and weight, so those will not be factors. The only difference will be that one person can't hold a paddle, or anything else. A canoe is not an option, as the place they're going is too narrow, and canoe rentals are not even available for that route. They could choose a different area and use a canoe, but they like this route as it offers the most options for seeing birds and other wildlife.
