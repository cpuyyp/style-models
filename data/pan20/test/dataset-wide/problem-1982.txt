They may be able to see what you've done, but, as @Moo said, that's only evidence of the output. It's not something that they can verify independently, or easily. This is a spec issue. If they've got a problem that they think will take 4 hours, they expect it to take 4 hours. If you think it's going to take more, tell them, discuss your reasoning. They're obviously going to give you deadlines in the future, and you're going to need to adhere to them. This is, frankly, irrelevant. What they're asking you to do isn't learning it's demonstrating. It doesn't matter that it holds little educational value to you, because that's not the point of the exercise. 

If you're talking an either-or situation, there are other factors to be considered. For me, I'd be looking at how often I'll need the added functionality of the laptop (the ability to take it to meetings/site visits, etc.) over the issues of fixed keyboard, trackpad, and screen. For me, being able to move my keyboard around my desk without throwing issues with the screen, and the ability to raise and lower the screen would do it for me. Plus the fact that a relatively small 17" monitor would be difficult to get on a laptop. 

Recommending someone is a gamble. Specifically, you are staking a portion of your reputation on that person's competence and future success, if they do well, then your opinion will be more respected, if they end up being more trouble than they're worth, then your reputation will suffer similarly. My advice would be to be honest, saying something along the lines of "I know this person, and they are good at XXX", where XXX is any skill (work related or not) that you are aware they are good at. 

I agree with the others that you did actually make the mistake of agreeing with the deadline. It is very difficult not to in the circumstances, I know. The essential things to do are from my own experience (and many others) in the "If Only" file of hard learned lessons. The first goal at all times to to manage the clients expectations. Or rather "Make sure you are working towards what they want." This includes getting it in writing that such code will work in such a way on such a date. With that you need to add in time to examine the current code. This takes more time than anyone leaves for it, always will. As reality moves in (usually badly) on what can possibly be coded it is up to you to make the new reality clearly known to those involved. The schedule must take it into account. As far as Machiavellian politics in management I have been through some of what you describe. The record keeping here may not ward of their attacks since getting the job done is only part of what they are after. Sorry you have to step through all this while doing a good job at programming. The major point that needs adding is this. As clever people (or brilliant-?-) the habit is often to underestimate the time needed for a task, as follows. When we have finally, doggedly worked out, or quickly spotted the solution to the issue at hand we can see from the start all the way to the very end. We behold the answer. This "Aha" point is probably the only reason I care about the work nowadays. Estimations based on such understanding overlook countless shovel fulls of -work- that lie between the vision and the outcome. This came to mind as you described your PhD as experience. A PhD is work all right but not like regular people work. School politics is not like work politics. I also agree with those who suggest you cannot win the battle they have placed you in, no matter how excellent your work. You should keep records of goals set and reached and keep your eyes open for your next position. 

This depends heavily on how busy the support is. If there needs to be 24/7 support "just in case", then this is likely to be done in the form of an on-call rota, whereby the person "on-call" is free to do their own thing, but may be required to respond to incoming calls if they occur. Typically, there's an "on-call bonus", combined with a rate for out-of-hours work. If the requirement is more fixed (i.e. there needs to be someone actively doing something 24/7), then it gets more complicated. Typically, a person works 8-hours per day, 5 days per week. 2 people can cover 2/3 of the requirement during the week, but nothing at weekends. 3 people can give you full coverage during the week, and nothing on weekends. Technically, a second person can fill in the weekend, but in most places, working for 48 hours straight is not something you can compel. At this point, a 4-man rota would usually switch to a 12-hour 4-day-on/4-day-off schedule. This would give you full coverage, and mean that you don't take all of a certain person's weekends, but with a 4-man rota, it doesn't leave a lot of leeway for absences. 

As said, there's a difference between informing someone of an opening, and endorsing them as a candidate. For the former, let people in the hiring process know about any relationship. For the latter, you need to be aware that what you're doing is gambling. You are betting a portion of your current standing on the success of your acquaintance. If they do well, then people will view you as someone with good judgement, you are the one that got them to hire this glowing beacon of productivity. If they mess up, then they'll distrust your judgement in the future. Why should they trust your estimates/work/opinion, you got them to hire that colossal nitwit! You need to be aware of what you're laying on the table, what you stand to gain, and what you stand to lose. 

Most answers include the point that the behavior should be addressed in private. This is because you as the boss, or the more mature of the two, are obliged to choose the best place to get your point across. Even if you were to correct his actions on the spot you should at least remove yourselves to another location, again privacy. Otherwise you would be shouting to all "O.K. Everybody! I'm going to take care of this issue here! Stand back y'all" The only point missed in the above answers is this. It is best to handle something that makes you angry (or upset etc.) when you are Not angry or upset. The emotional component (or anxiety of surprise in a public confrontation) will make it hard to deal with any situation. This is not a confrontation you are out to win once and for all but a problem you hope to avoid in the future. As a talker who too often gives more information than desired I have received this talk on occasion. 

I'm not sure just when but its probably since programming computers took off. When a user can see how little is needed(?) to make a change they are much more likely to ask for continuous improvements. Painting and plumbing even though not professions they are trades and real jobs that are over when you're finished. Once the tools are put away no one would come back and ask for more. Now that everyone has a keyboard they cannot see the problem with those they hire continuing to type away to their ever increasing specifications. The masons/Masons had it right. You don't give away the methods of doing the job and you don't start to work until the money and scope are agreed upon. Myself, I've always had agreements worked out that would specify what would be complete in the current phase and leave the sloppy ideas for the next phase. If it is not part of the current phase "I'm sorry, I won't have the time". It's up to you to set the boundaries. My buddy charges three times my hourly rate and he bills half time for driving over a certain distance to a client. I'm getting by alright. He lives in a house larger than mine that he paid off in eleven years. YMMV. 

The only time I could see this being done would be if the first round was a recruiter screening, and then they ask you to refine your resume before passing it to the company (your applications should be different on a per-application basis anyway). Worth pointing out that I would avoid changing my given details mid-application, as that may indicate that you're trying to hide something, or are being less-than-truthful about some aspects. 

Worth pointing out that many employers have rules about cell pones and personal calls, so reasonable recruiters/potential employers shouldn't require an immediate response to all calls. That being said, there will be some that will think less of you for letting your phone go to voicemail. Two points that I would make would be, as said above, ensure that your voicemail functions, and you either get notified of messages, or check regularly. Second, I would avoid putting your new number on any broadcasted application. If you make an application to a role, then that's fine, but if you're posting your CV on a job board/site, then I'd avoid it. I've found recruiters to be somewhat persistent and obstinate as a general rule (not all, but enough to get to me), and tend to call you repeatedly about opportunities which are not suitable, or not desired.
