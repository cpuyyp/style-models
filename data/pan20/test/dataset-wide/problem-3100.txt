The Scottish Agrarian Revolution in the Highlands The agricultural revolution in Scotland had begun in the 17th century in the Scottish lowlands. There was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture in Scotland and make the land more productive. Before this, many aspects of agriculture in Scotland would be familiar to students of European medieval farming. Ridge-and furrow fields (known as "run-rig" in Scotland) and common land for grazing were the norm. Following the union of Scotland and England in 1707, the improvers began to introduce new crops and new techniques into Scotland. They also began a programme of enclosures of common land that broadly mirrored what had happened in England. Initially, this had little effect on the highlands. Many clan chiefs felt bound by the loyalties of the highland culture, and were resistant to change. After the 1745 rebellion, however, most of the best land in the highlands was controlled by just a few powerful families. These were, by-and-large, the same families who had taken the lead in dismantling the system of tacksmen (e.g. the Duke of Argyle, the Duke of Atholl, the Duke of Buccleuch, and the Duke of Sutherland). They also effectively controlled Scottish politics and the Scottish economy. Under their leadership the process of improvement gained momentum in the highlands. The change in the highlands was much more rapid than it had been in the lowlands. The lessons learned in the Scottish lowlands were applied wholesale to the highlands. Although the people remained loyal to their chiefs, by this stage, the people seem to have become just one component in the estates that generated the revenues of the chiefs. Of course, those who lost most when the land was enclosed were the lowest strata of society, the crofters and especially the landless cottars. 

The arrangement of modern Christian gatherings is the result of the development of early church architecture. In the early days, up to the fourth century, Christians worshipped along with Jews in synagogues and private houses. After Jewish and Christian worship separated, Christians continued to worship in people's houses (known as house churches), often the homes of the wealthier members of the community in a particular town. In the smaller gatherings, the evidence (for example the testimony of the apologist Justin Martyr) suggests that everyone participated in the act of worship. This changed as the church became increasingly "clericalised". Clerics carried out the act of worship at the alter, the congregation observed from a distance. This gave rise to the "two-room" church, with the mass being celebrated in the Sanctuary and the congregation in the Nave observing through the arched "doorway" between the rooms. In the medieval period, the doorway was partially blocked by a wooden "rood screen" with holes to allow the congregation to observe. The congregation was arranged in rows. Initially, people seem to have stood to observe the ceremonies before backless stone benches were introduced for the congregation (from about the 13th century in England. Some on the continent were earlier). These were often subsequently replaced with wooden pews. Wealthier members were often seated in private "family pews" (which they paid for). Rood screens went out of fashion with the Reformation, but the basic layout - with the clerics at the front being observed by the congregation in rows - remained. Aisles allowed processions to run the length of the church and also easier access to the seating. As an architectural feature in churches, aisles were inherited (together with much else) from the design of the Roman basilica (e.g. Trajan's Basilica in Rome). 

since that position didn't actually exist when Eisenhower was posted to London. Another critical factor was that Eisenhower was also extremely good at working with people. He: 

Unfree peasants Villans were both the wealthiest, and the most numerous of the unfree peasants. They made up about 40% of the population recorded in Domesday, and often held fairly substantial portions of land (up to 40 acres is recorded in some instances). They were 'unfree' in the sense that their tenancy required that they worked the land belonging to the Lord of the Manor for (generally) 2 or 3 days each week. Bordars and cottars were less-free than villans, and owed a much greater service to the Lord of the Manor. They also generally owned much less land (perhaps only an acre or two, in many cases even less). Given the service they owed to their lord, this might have been as much as they were actually able to work! It is worth noting that: 

The calculated value is expressed in "tons burden". In Early Modern English this would be written as "tons burthen", and in Middle English as "tons byrthen". You'll notice that this formula would give a result in 94ths of a ton. This was the version of the calculation used in the UK. I was also confused when I first saw values quoted in 95ths of a ton in documents. The Builder's Old Measurement system was adopted for use in the United States under An Act for Registering and Clearing Vessels, Regulating the Coasting Trade, and for other purposes, passed in September 1789, but the denominator in the formula was changed to 95: 

The Stuart kings James I and Charles I both kept the form of the coronation oath they had inherited from the Tudors, and after the Restoration, Charles II and James II both took the same oath as Charles I. Following the Glorious Revolution, however, Parliament felt able to flex its muscles. This led to a series of acts that redefined the English monarchy, beginning with re-writing the coronation oath, set out in the Coronation Oath Act of 1688, and ending with the Bill of Rights, agreed by William and Mary in 1689. 

There is no internationally agreed definition of servitude, but the term is generally used to describe a condition of serfdom, without implying an element of ownership of the victim as the term “slavery” does. 

The figure for 1825 was approximately half that exported in 1939, so it seems unlikely that it would have amounted to 50% of the Honourable East India Company's profits (never mind the profits of the British Empire as a whole!). However, the Wikipedia page on the HEIC states that by 1825: 

In addition to the "patrician" Optimates and "plebeian" Populares, there was also a third group - the Equites - which today we might think of as a kind of 'upper middle class'. To complicate matters still further, by no means all members of the Patrician class were associated with the Optimates faction. Perhaps the best-known example is Julius Caesar, who belonged to the Patrician class, but was politically aligned with the Populares (although quite how far he shared the Populares agenda remains a matter for debate). You are absolutely right that the three groupings were not remotely like political parties in the modern sense. In modern political parties, people tend to give their loyalty to the party and follow a party line. The groupings in ancient Rome were rather shifting groups of alliances between smaller sub-groups of wealthy and powerful people. Political support in Rome was primarily mobilised by patronage or clientela - the relationship between wealthy, influential patrons and their poorer but free dependants. The concept is complex to modern eyes (and I suspect it was not much less complex to ancient Roman eyes). It had some elements that we might think of as the more modern notion of noblesse-oblige. Other aspects we might associate with the techniques employed by modern drug lords or Mafia kingpins. These could involve acts of charity and patronage or through the use of enforcers with clubs and brass knuckles. If a patron changed sides, he would expect his clientele to come with him. The shifting allegiances could give rise to some very strange outcomes (at least to modern eyes). Consider the election of Crassus and Pompey as co-consuls in 70BC (they hated each other) or, even more bizarre to modern eyes, the election of Caesar and Bibulus in 62BC! It may be easier to understand the way that the system worked if you remember that most votes were controlled by this network of patronage. Individual patrons were often themselves caught up in the network of patronage of more important figures. It would not be at all unusual for someone to repay a favour to one patron by calling their clients to support a particular candidate (say from the Optimates) for election as a Praetor, while simultaneously also agreeing with another patron to support a candidate from the rival camp (in this example, the Populares) for election as an Aedile at the same time. 

In fairness, journalists - even on the "broadsheets" - are not generally expected to be experts in genetics (or statistics!). More information about the People of the British Isles DNA project can be found on their website. 

At the other end of society, the figures are equally difficult to calculate, but the Medieval Prices and Wages page (from the History of England podcast site) notes that an unskilled labourer might earn two pence (2d) per working day in 1300. A six-day week would thus earn him 12d, or 1 shilling per week. This is 52 shillings, or 624d per annum. Even further down the hierarchy, a swineherd would earn 0.3d per working day, or about 93d per annum. 

This would correspond to the Reign of Alfred the Great in Wessex. Alfred's reign was characterised by conflicts with Viking raiders and invaders. It is not hard to imagine just how useful an all-metal lock would have been when trying to defend person and property from Viking attacks! If this dating is correct, it is also easy to understand the incentives that might have led to the development of these locks in England at that time. 

So, for now (in the absence of contradictory evidence from other sites), it seems that we can say with some confidence that the ancestors of the Tarim mummies originated in the steppes of southern Siberia. 

I've seen this story a number of times since Another Earth was released in 2011, usually something along lines like this article. The problem is that I've never seen anything about it in any of the official histories or biographies of Gagarin. Also, the stories all seem to think Gagarin's mission was to last 25 (or 28 depending on the story) days. In fact, the flight of Vostok 1 was only a single orbit and took only 108 minutes from launch to landing. Not much time to spend searching for a "ticking sound"! Vostok 1 was Gagarin's only spaceflight (although he served as backup crew for the Soyuz 1 mission), so I think that the stories are based on the movie, rather than the line from the movie being based on actual events. 

Background to the Famine There were undoubtedly a number of factors that came together to cause the 1943 Bengall famine. Many of these are covered in some detail in the Wikipedia article on the subject. It is also extremely difficult, if not impossible, to assign a definitive starting date to the actual onset of the famine. This is particularly true since different districts in Bengal suffered the effects at different times and to varying degrees. The Government of India dated the onset of full-scale famine to May 1943. However, there is some uncertainty about quite how much was known in London, and when, about the severity of the famine. In his 1990 book, Bengal Tiger and British Lion: An Account of the Bengal Famine of 1943, Richard Stevenson laid a great deal of the blame at the door of the then Viceroy, Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow. Certainly, the lack of reliable statistics does appear to have been a significant factor in the government's apparent reluctance to act earlier. 

The reverse of these copies have the legend United States of America around the wreath as you describe: 

Although these are discussed in the text, Ruppenthal doesn't provide the information in a readily accessible, tabular format. Fortunately, further detail on POL (Petrol, Oil & Lubricants) and vehicles discharged to the European theatre are to be found in the charts attached as appendices to The Operation, Organization, Supply, and Services of the Transportation Corps in the European Theater of Operations which is available online as a pdf document for download. The following charts are taken from that document: 

The British did develop the technology further. Captured Mysorean rockets were returned to the UK, and the Royal Woolwich Arsenal started a military rocket research and development program in 1801. 

In April 1944, we know that Wavel was reporting that the situation in India was still dire. At this point, Churchill even wrote to President Roosevelt to ask for assistance: 

There have been several stages in the history of Canadian independence. Canada became a self-governing dominion within the British empire on 1 July 1867 when the British North America Act was passed by the UK Parliament. The Statute of Westminster, passed by the UK Parliament in 1931, acknowledged Canada as co-equal with the United Kingdom within the British Commonwealth. Canada obtained full autonomy when the UK Parliament passed the Canada Act 1982 in 1982. This granted full sovereignty to Canada, and so marks the date at which Canada became truly independent. 

I think Pieter's interpretation of events is correct. You can read a lot more about the context for what was being discussed in May 1940 in the Cabinet Papers and related documents (series CAB 65-68 & CAB 195), many of which are now available as PDF downloads from the UK National archives. 

The Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or VoC) was actually founded by the States General of the Netherlands. The States General themselves date back to the 15th century. The right of the States General to convene on their own initiative had been recognised in 1477 by Mary of Burgundy. 

A consequence of this debt was that landlords needed to raise funds quickly. Estates might be sold to clear the debt (completely breaking the link of the clan chief with his people), rents might be significantly increased, or the tenants might be replaced with sheep farmers who could afford to pay higher rents. 

What We Know: We know that William Marshal accepted the bequest of the Crusader Cross of Henry the Young King, the son of Henry II, when Henry was on his deathbed. We know that Henry died on 11 June 1183 which gives us one fixed date. William Marshal's biography states that he spent two years in the Holy Land. We are told that he served the King of Jerusalem, and that he performed great deeds of arms. We're told that he earned the respect of both the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller He didn't join either order, but fought as a lay brother with the Templars. He did however take a vow to join the Knights Templar before he died. He seems to have been back in Europe by 1187. We're told that he brought two shrouds of white Damascus silk for his own burial. He did join the Templars before his death in 1219, and was buried in the Temple Church in London (you can still see his tomb there). And that's about it! 

Interestingly, in most cases, children would remain in the custody of the father. We have examples of this in the case of the daughters of King Louis VII of France and his wife Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine. Louis and Eleanor were eventually granted an annulment of the ground of consanguinity, and their daughters Alix of France and Marie of France were given into the custody of their father. In this particular case, the girls were declared illegitimate in the courts, but not because of the annulment.
