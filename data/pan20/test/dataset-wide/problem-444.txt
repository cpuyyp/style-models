(source) ISIS has an estimated total of 50000–250000 soldiers and slowly gains strength from 1999, when it was founded. Now, my question is: How can I possibly stop the ISIS? By stop, I mean to or a) totally annihilate the organization - destroy their infrastructure, bases and weapons, free the captured land and kill/jail all it's members, or b) to force the terrorists (or better, terrorISISts) to give up and surrender their forces. Let's assume that: 

So, altogether, we get $$9700 + 244000 + 889500 + 3000000 + 554550 = 4700000$ $$ Every day. That is $4700000 × 365 = 1715000000$ \$ a year. How much does the project cost? What is needed to buy: 

Now, let's calculate, how much water to convert can we afford: Each day, can use $9 × 10^{14}$J to convert water to methane. For each kilogram, we need $294000 + (180 × 10^6 × 0.9) = 162294000$J. With $9 × 10^{14}$ J every day, we get $\frac{9 × 10^{14}}{162294000} = 55455000$kg of water converted every day. That is also a 194000kg load of salt. 

(Planets and stars are not scaled right) So, for me, this is not possible long-term, with a normal-sized planet, and this would be even more unstable, if one of he stars had a much bigger mass. Edit conducted by the flags: this answer adds perspective - shows through an animation how chaotic this concept is. But the animation isn't the main part - The text (answer) part is. The answer is no, this is not possible long-term. 

So, let's do some maths. This is hard science, people! (Skip to the TL;DR at the end, or plunge waist-deep through maths): We get about 235GW of power. That is 1020TJ ($1020 × 10^{12}$) of energy generated every day (assuming the Sun shines at 100% exactly 12 hours a day) Let's round that down, what if: 1PJ ($10^{15}$) of energy. Every day. What the project does: 

Today's big problem (over-emphasized) by media: ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) or, in other words, the biggest and only terrorist organisation that managed to conquer land and keep it for a longer time nowadays. Now, as of September 2016, the area it holds is: 

Most probably this can exist, but will be stable for only a very short time. If the planet had really small mass or maybe was just a comet, it could be stable. Here's an animation (I know it's not much - made by eye) showing how this idea would look like - it seems insane to me: 

TL;DR: It would take 10 YEARS only to refund this project. With a \$224M input, nobody will really do this, but it's possible! Of course, that doesn't mean that it will happen. PS. If you see I made a mistake, please tell me (but don't try to find a mistake, please :) ) 

(Planets and stars are not scaled right) This animation is a bit hard to get, so I made another one which shows the same, just without the stars rotating: 

Imagine this situation: One warm night of 1890, you go home from a pub. You pass a creepy house. In the half-open door, you see the outline of a machine. You go in, and open the lights. You see a big machine, exactly like those time machines you imagined of when you were small. You sit in it, pull the lever, and... you fall out. The worlds goes black. Then, you wake up, and you see everything is different. It isn't nighttime anymore, the room you are in looks a bit different then you remembered, and... there are two city officers shouting on you what the hell are you doing here. You ask, "What year is it?". "1890" "What!? Are you kidding me?" Sounds like you just got drunk too much last night. But the problem: They think you came from the future! That this is some kind of modern 20th century time machine you are on. The guards insist you come with them to some place and say something about time travel. You exclaim: "But I'm not from the future!" "We're not going to let you run just like that! You just came from another time and we're gonna let you go? No way! Now come on!" So you screwed up. Again. How on Earth can you prove you're not from the future to a 19th/20th century person? How could you prove this to a 21st century person? 

No, Billy-Jeah isn't in danger of crashing down anytime soon. Given the size ratio and distance between parent body and child body, Jeah's gravitational effect shouldn't be too different from the current tidal effects on Earth. Keep in mind, though, this is assuming that Jeah and Paveiah share Earth and Luna's makeup; if, say, Jeah was made completely of iron, then this estimate is off. Gathering the increased level of oxygen, it's possible that Earth-style creatures would have increased energy. Big bugs, stronger animals, and more flammable areas. This, though, is assuming that the extra oxygen doesn't KILL them; too much of a good thing, after all... Given the previous information, it's safe to say that the far side will definitely have permanent ice. But the nearest point to the star's light would receive the maximum amount of solar radiation it could get. Given that there's a huge hunk of land there, this'll likely mean that weather patterns will be driven partly by temperature differences, with hot air of the near side rushing away to meet the cool air from the far side. This should translate to a belt of vegetation between the two zones, and rainstorms would likely be frequent along this area. That, I cannot answer adequately, I'm afraid. Because that would require me to make a whole host of assumptions about my species and its current level of technology. Even with humanity, we're only good enough to give a "maybe" for whether a planet even has liquid water on its surface. The fascinating point, really, is whatever you set it to be; beauty, as they say, is in the eye of the beholder. 

1. Assuming you're using "Ye Olde Dinosaurs", then those forementioned climactic limits would probably be more in effect. While even Herbivorous dinosaurs could have some extra blubber for those lean times, it wouldn't be enough to live in arctic environments. That'd be where humans would have to set up cities. Farming spots would be prime competition with destructive herbivores; humans would either need to take up herding/ranching, or would be stuck as hunter/gatherers, in small tribal communities. 

Hill Sphere Every object has a set gravitational field; you, me, the earth, cheese, and the galaxy all are gravitationally attracted to one another. Gravity though is a function of mass and distance, which means that the larger and closer an object is, the more gravitational pull it will exert. This also means that if an object is moving fast enough, but close enough, or a large center of mass, then it will orbit that mass. This zone is the Hill Sphere. 

FYI: I am not a survivalist. The closest I've been to water is on a beach, both an oceanic one and on a riverbank fishing one time. If you find yourself in this situation, do not rely on the methods I suggest. . You nailed two of the big ones right off the bat: dust/smoke and biological debris. But there's several other things one could use to infer the presence of dry land. Plate Tectonics All that was stated about the locals is that they are low-tech and live on lily pads. Having not read the book (and partly from the vagueness of the terms you used), I have no idea just how low that low-tech is, but assuming they're able to swim and have been living here for some time, they're bound to find areas where the sea bed seems to slope upwards, either gradually or sharply. If they can follow the slope upwards, then (theoretically) they should be able to at least find a sea mount, which is fairly close. Coastal Life Forms? If there are lily pads, then they must've come from somewhere! And if there is dry land, then there will be creatures adapted to take advantage of the halfway lifestyle. Birds, for example, cannot live forever on the wing; they need roosting places, to rest and nest. Creatures with limbs can't swim as efficiently as finned or flippered swimmers, but they can crawl on land. So seek out life forms which are known to live at least partly on land, and follow them. They'll lead you to land. Folklore Assuming the locals are native to the planet (I.e., evolved there), then they'll probably have stories about how they used to live on land. Such tales, whether oral or written, can be used alongside education to search for real-life places. The City of Troy, for instance, was a real city discovered by following clues left in the Illiad and the Odyssey. Such reverse-engineered maps could also lead to forgotten islands and the like. Just some ideas to consider. Hope it helps! 

An intelligent race evolves on a planet with no moon or axial tilt, which is tidally locked to its star, and has a very hazy atmosphere. So there are no seasons, no day/night cycle, and the stars are not visible either. The planet has a permanently dark and a permanently bright side, which will probably cause some nasty weather, but the important thing is: there is no natual phenomenon which would force the concept of time on its inhabitants, no periodic events which are always the same and affect everyone's life. How will they organize their lives? How do they cooperate on tasks when there is no such thing as "tomorrow" or "at dawn"? How will a lack of seasonal agriculture or animal migration affect society? Even more fundamental: can human-level intelligence even develop when there is no real need for planning ahead more than a meal or two? How different will their thinking processes be? 

We actually have fossil records of biological life at least 2.7 billion old, possibly 3.4 billion. And if something as fragile as bacteria leaves traces over that timespan, it's rather unrealistic to believe that a civilzation wouldn't, even if all obvious traces would be wiped out after a few dozen millenia. However, it's a game of numbers. It takes a lot of coincidences for something to be preserved that long, and then to be found. So the more artifacts a civilization produces (should depend mainly on area/time covered and population density) and the more people are looking, the more likely it is that something will be found. 

Hmm... To me, those two points combined spell out one thing: magical cannonballs! The cannon provides a greater range than a spellcaster, magic provides a greater effect (area, incendiary, wall-busting, etc.) than a regular cannonball. Then again, there would be little reason to use cannons over catapults in that scenario. 

The eruption would do absolutely nothing to "Earth as a whole". On a geological scale, it's a minor blip, nothing special. Has happened hundreds of times. The effects it would have on the climate are rather difficult to predict, analyses of previous supervolcano eruption e.g. Lake Toba don't seem to agree well. They vary between "other parts of the world weren't affected very much" and "it triggered a 1000 year ice age". At minimum you'd get a global average temperature drop of several degrees resulting in severe winters and lukewarm summers for a few years. Of course, even that could easily be enough to wipe out many less adaptible species, but those that occur in a large geographic range would have a very good chance of surviving even a real ice age in some spots with more favorable conditions and have their population numbers recover afterwards. 

Oh boy, that gives me a nasty idea... Who says it's the ground below them which they farm? So, these creatures live mainly off "huge irregular windfalls" that basically happen when for some reason there's a lot of dead biomass coming down from the surface... What if they found a way to engineer those "windfalls"? The article you link to mentions algae blooms as the cause of the windfalls they observed. Well, algae bloom when they get more nutrients than normal, mainly phosphates. So if your Crabites somehow find a way to propel large amounts of phosphates towards the surface, they could do some pretty productive farming! Maybe this is something that occasionally happens naturally in a way they can observe, understand and later influence, e.g. hot water vents creating an updraft in the middle of a phosphate deposit on the seafloor. Or, in a rather less pastoral and more terrifying vein: the Crabites could also release toxins that float up and cause a large-scale dieoff of surface life in an area...
