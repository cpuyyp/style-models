Shimano 11 speed (5800) should be assembled with a Shimano chain connector pin. The pin is pushed through and the end breaks off. 9/10/11 speed chains outer plates are too narrow to reuse pins. There is literally no margin for error. You actually break part of the pin when you push it out, as such it won't stay in place if reinserted. A missed shift can easily pry the outer plate off the pin causing the chain to fail. I suspect you were sold a used or pre-installed chain, where they pushed the pin partially as a "service" to you, but if you reinsert that pin in all likelihood the chain will fail at some point in the future. 

Tire Liner - Cheap and reusable as it can be applied to current tires, but has a fiddly set up (e.g., getting the liner to stay in place), will reduce suppleness of the tire and does not provide puncture protection on the side wall. Puncture resistant tires - These have what is in essence a liner built into the tire carcass. Because of the unified construction should be more supple build than a tire liner and vary the degree of coverage. Different manufacturers and models will have different trade-off between suppleness and puncture resistance. Tubless - Primary goal is really to create a more supple tire. Mounting a tubeless setup can be a hassle (i.e., you need high pressure) so often sealant is added to handle small punctures. Not intended to be "better" than (2) in terms of puncture protection, but optimizing a different set of criteria. 

If the wheel is built with the appropriate rim (i.e., a rim with a braking surface) you should be fine. The hub simply has the mounts for a disc brake, one does not have to be mounted. 

What about hard tail? To compensate for lack of rear suspension travel you need to use your legs more. You should be riding above the saddle more often than with a full suspension bike. For example, if you are pedalling over roots or rocks you need to learn to pedal while hovering over the saddle. This lets the bike move over the terrain, maintaining traction and forward momentum. So what are the advantages of a hard tail? Hard tails are typically lighter bikes (less parts), and can be more efficient to pedal especially on long climbs. As such they still have a following among Cross Country (XC) mountain bike racers on smother courses. That said, I have personally found the efficiency gains can be easily lost in rougher terrain (e.g., Squamish BC). Hard tails are also cheaper to manufacture (the frame doesn't have any moving parts) so you can get a better equipped bike for your dollar. This makes hard tails good first bike. Hard Tail or Full Suspension Whether or you choose hard tail or full suspension really depends on your experience, budget, riding style and roughness of your terrain. What constitutes rough differs from area to area. I personally live and ride on the North Shore of Vancouver Canada which has some incredibly rough and steep trails (pictured above). My XC bike has 5 inches of travel front and rear and I use all of it on XC rides. It does not have enough travel for some of the more advanced downhill trails in our area. When I was visiting Bend Oregon, the riding was so smooth that my 5 inch XC bike was a rather silly choice and I would rather have been on a rigid (no suspension) bike. In the end the choice is a personal one and the cost/benefit will be different for every rider. Injuries Injuries really depends on a combination of your bike handling skill, your riding terrain, and your risk tolerance. There is also the probability of crashing combined with extent of injuries. Full suspension often lets people ride harder terrain than they might otherwise, which has potentially bigger consequences. Anecdotally, I have observed those with the most suspension also tend also to have the biggest injuries. 

If there is no debris still in the tire, then add pressure back to what you regularly run. If it holds, which it most likely will, then consider it fixed! Sometimes if the sealant hasn't had sufficient time to cure (or there is still debris) the hole will re form. In this case spin the wheel a bit so sealant meets the hole and wait for the sealant to do its thing. Let it cure a bit longer, then try adding more pressure. If there is something still in the hole, you should remove it (to prevent further tire damage), then go through the above described steps to get the sealant to reseal. The only time you really need to patch is when the hole is too large for the sealant to plug. What do I do if it won't seal? 

If you can imagine a compromise between a mountain bike that is light weight and easy to pedal, versus one with that is strong and has lots of suspension travel to tackle rougher terrain you might get a diagram such as the one below. As we go from category to category we get heavier bikes that are harder to pedal, but that can handle rougher and rougher terrain, bigger jumps, etc. The diagram also shows overlap between the categories as depending on how the manufacturer set up the bike you can argue it could be considered to belong to one or the other category. Caveat - I am sure some will take issue with the exact size and overlap of the different categories, but the figure is intended to be illustrative only. 

This is essentially the worst combination for fitting, which means ordering sight unseen will be difficult to guarantee the best fit. Being marketed with the words "race" makes me concern that the frames may not have enough stack, but looking at the geo chart suggests the stack is decent. All that said, I think either the 17" or 18" could work, the 19" is too big. Both the 17 and 18" have nearly identical stack heights, but differ in front-center dimensions (and reach) due to differences in seat tube angles (the top tube length is also nearly identical between the two). The two sizes also use different wheel sizes. The 17" uses 29er wheels (larger), a slacker seat tube angle and therefore as has a shorter front to center measurement and a 1 cm shorter reach, while the 18" uses smaller wheels (27.5) and a longer front to center measurement. Perhaps this is to offset handling characteristics of the different wheel sizes? I would almost phone to confirm the geometries. Choosing between the two may mean picking a wheel size. The larger wheel size will be a bit more stable, which could be good for leisure riding. It also has a shorter reach which is good for a shorter torso. Therefore if I had to hazard a guess (danger) I would suggest the 17". Depending on how your legs are proportioned (i.e., femur to tibia) you may need to move the saddle forward if you have long tibias/short femurs, as a shallow seat tube angle is better suited to someone with longer femurs. Given that you haven't tried the bike, also be prepared to have to change the stem. Given the long legs, there is a good chance of long arms which could mean a longer stem. Also given that long inseams effectively shorten the stack height relative to someone with shorter inseams, you may need to use a riser stem and possibly a riser handle bars to get the position high enough. A quick check of arm length would be to measure your wing span (an outward facing wall corner can be good for this) and compare it to your height. Most bikes are proportioned as if the two match. If you have a proportionately longer wingspan you will likely need a longer stem so that you don't feel cramped, if you have a shorter wingspan you may need a shorter stem so you don't feel stretched out. Finally, realize that when you flip a stem up (aka riser) you loose reach, so with more aggressive stem rise you may need to find extend the stem length as well. Geom Charts 

One of the considerations (assuming you are able to get a good seal) is that air loss under a tire burping may be worse than a tubeless specific rim. In CX this is definitely a consideration, especially if you are pushing the lower limits of tire pressure (e.g., < 30 psi on 700x33c is amazing on slick off camber turns, but it is easy to fold the tire in a hard high traction turn). A large burp could drop the pressure dangerous low, resulting a loss of control and injury. For running on the road, it is unlikely you will want the pressure at such low levels, so burping events are much less likely. [DISREGARD - see Update] Update - Nov 28, 2016 Found this quote from Lennard Zinn: 

Increasing the handlebar height may be opening up your pelvis/hips enough that blood flow is no longer obstructed, resulting in a higher power. 

Above all I would consider getting an assessment from a physiotherapist who can identify functional mobility issues. This is the best place to start, especially considering one knee is deflecting out nearly 1/2 foot more than your other. When one knee tracking is this far off, it is only a matter of time before repetitive stress injuries arise. Bike fit changes can compensate, but the issue will likely re-emerge especially if there are further change to flexibility and functioning. Once issues are identified, you will likely be given strengthening and stretching routines to help address the issue. It is worth sticking to them for long term health. 

Yes. This has been studied thoroughly. And while there are lots of general rules of thumb to get you into good starting place, the best possible saddle height is individual specific and depends on your own unique biomechanics (and can change over time). Saddle setback (front/back position) is another important factor for power generation. 

My wife is 5' 2" and raced elite road for many years. For her proportions 48-49 cm frames seemed to work well. Sometime she had mentioned interest in a smaller frame, but when I looked at how she fit on the bike I think it was due to flexibility issues (at that time) rather than frame sizing issues. Of course this is one person's experience and therefore not a canonical answer. There are a lot of factors, other than frame size, that govern fit, but 48/49cm is likely a good starting point for someone 5'2". NOTE: different brands will have slightly different fit dimensions (stack and reach) for the same quoted frame size. Frame sizing is not standardized. 

Road cycling position is generally a performance position (although not always) and can be viewed as a compromise between three components: 

You already known the answer (2), but do not seem to care much for it. The reality is that you are the fastest user on the shared path thus you bear the most responsibility. I would suggest 

To convert your frame to QR you would need to replace your dropouts, which is problematic as they are either bonded or welded in place on the frame. This is basically a no go. A much easier solution however is to replace your thru axle itself with another thru axle that gives ends that are compatible with older trainers. These exist and are reasonably affordable (well affordable when compared to major frame reconstruction or or a frame swap). A couple examples are pictured below: 

Deep section rims were primarily developed for aerodynamic gains for TT (time trial) and now road racing in general. In this application low weight and a low spoke count are the design priorities. These design priorities are at odds with the touring application, where speeds are slower, aerodynamics at generally ignored (panniers hanging off the bike are essentially parachutes), and robustness is the top priority. As such, few if any manufacturer have developed a deep section touring rim as the functional use case makes little sense. In the last couple decades deep section rims have also been cooped as a fashion statement by urban hipsters, so there may be the odd manufacturer who made something to fill this cross-over (e.g., Velocity Deep-V) but now you are heading into boutique custom wheel builds. 

Start by setting up your saddle (i.e., saddle height and level) Next, set your cockpit reach and stack height so you feel in balance with little weight on your hands. The optimal reach/stack height really varies by how hard you ride. Full out race pace means the balance point is farther forward and down. More relaxed pacing means it shorter and higher. I often change the setup depending on what I plan to do.
