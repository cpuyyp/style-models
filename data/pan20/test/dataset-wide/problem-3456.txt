Now, I don't know if it is because I am sleep deprived or because there is a typo, but I just can't seem to get the same results as Walsh. E.g, differentiating w.r.t $c_{t}$ I get: $u_{c}(c_{t},m_{t}) + \beta*V_{w}(w_{t+1})[\frac{-f'(w_{t}-c_{t}-m_{t}-b_{t})}{1+n}(-1)+\frac{1+\delta}{1+n}(-1)]$ While Walsh gets 

So far I have no problems. But then he defines current period utility as: $V(c_{1},...c_{n}) = U[\pi_{i=1}^{n}(\frac{c_{i}}{\alpha_{i}})^{\alpha_{i}}]$ where U is a standard utility function. $\sum _{i} \alpha_{i}=1$ and $\sum _{i} c_{i}=c$ What seems to confuse me is first of all the use of lower case pi. Surely Lucas is referring to the multiplication operator? I.e $V(c_{1},...c_{n}) = U[(\frac{c_{1}}{\alpha_{1}})^{\alpha_{1}}...(\frac{c_{n}}{\alpha_{n}})^{\alpha_{n}}]$ Then he says that the relative prices of the goods must be unity which I understand. However, the next part is where my main source of confusion lies, he says: 

I tried equating MRS to the relative prices (i.e 1) but since I'm unsure about the form of the utility function I don't know if my working is correct. Also, I am very confused about the definition of $\alpha$. What does it mean for agents to have weights? Is it just a way of stating that they are equally distributed? 

This question isn't about asymmetric information per se but rather one of the assumptions. Consider a market for second hand cars; there are lemons (low-quality cars) and plums (high-quality cars). For lemons, the valuations are: $V_{b} = 1500 $ and $V_{s} = 1000$. The subscripts denote buyer (b) and seller (s). For plums: $V_{b} = 4000$ and $V_{s} = 3000$ The buyer knows that there is an equal amount of each car (i.e., the probability of the car being high or low quality is 50%) but she doesn't observe the quality. This results in market failure because the buyer is willing to pay $\frac{1}{2}(1500 + 4000) = 2750$ Therefore the sellers of plums leave the market because $2750 < 3000$ and only sellers of lemons remain. And now the buyer is only willing to pay 1500, therefore only lemons will be traded. What is confusing me is that it seems like we are assuming that the buyer knows the sellers valuations. I.e., the buyer knows that because the seller values plums at 3000, and the buyers expected valuation is below this, those sellers will leave the market. Am I misunderstanding something or is this the actual assumption in this case? 

First of all, are we assuming that the government borrows from the private sector and spends it on something that improves productivity? For example, the government could borrow from the private sector and spend it on a road (something that increases productivity) or they could spend it on unemployment benefits (beneficial, but not productive). I think "real stock of government bonds" is what is confusing me. So the way I understand the first reason is that if government debt becomes too high and the interest payments exceed the growth rate of the economy, this will not be sustainable because the government will have to pay more to the private sector than is produced by the private sector. For example, consider a extremely simplified economy where corn is the only thing produced and the agents are: (i) the government (ii) the private sector. So the government borrows 1 ton of corn from the private sector and promises to pay back 2 tons next year. They use that corn to improve corn producing ability of the private sector. However, the private sector was only able to produce 1.5 tons of corn the following year. Hence the real government debt is too high relative to the real size of the economy. Is this what Sargent and Wallace are referring to? The second reason sounds very logical but I just want to ensure I understand it correctly. Is it simply saying that if the interest payments on government debt becomes too high, they will have to raise taxes to a level that is not optimal? However, the second reason appears to be very similar to my corn example so it feels like I am not understanding the authors reasoning very well. If anyone could explain or refer me to a source, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks to @Boaten I was able to find the solution. For those interested here are the steps for deriving the Fisher relation: Combining the FOC $[b_{t}]$ and the envelope for $[b_{t-1}]$ we get $U_{c_{t}} = \beta E_{t}\frac{U_{c_{t+1}}(1+i_{t})}{1+\pi _{t+1}}$ Assuming utility is log in both arguments this can be simplified as $\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_{t}} = \beta E_{t} \frac{1+i_{t}}{1+\pi _{t+1}}$ The author assumes $c_{t} = y - g$, thus the left-hand side is 1. Thus we get $\frac{1}{R_{t}} = \beta E_{t}[\frac{1}{1+ \pi_{t+1}}]$ which is the result I was after. 

I am reading Some Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic (Sargent and Wallace, 1981) and I had some questions about a claim made by the authors. They say: 

This is an excerpt from a data source that I am using. According to the authors it has been created from accounting identities such that it matches theoretical variables used in macroeconomics. For example, they state that the consolidated government constraint is: $T_t + S_t + \Delta B_t^p = G_t +I_t + i_t B_{t-1}^p$ Where $T_t$ is tax revenue, $S_t$ is seigniorage, $B_t^p$ is government debt owned by the public, $G_t + I_t$ is government spending on consumption and investments and $i_t B_{t-1}^p$ is interest payments to the public. This is inline with government constraints I have seen in textbooks. However, when I use their data, I cannot seem to get correct numbers. For example, consider $t = 1802$: $T_t = 9844$, $S_t =813$, $G_t + I_t = 7096 $, $i_t B_{t-1}^p = 1083$, $\Delta B_{t}^p = 23406 - 22243$ and clearly the number do not add up. However, when I calculate the consolidated deficit ($G_t +I_t + i_t B_{t-1}^p -(T_t + S_t))$ I get something very similar to $DEF_t^c$. So I am quite confused as to what I am doing wrong. My only guess is that it has to do with the timing notation. I.e $\Delta B_{t}^p \neq B_{t}^p - B_{t-1}^p$. Any ideas on what I am doing wrong? 

This is an example taken from Krugman's book: Consider the case where the international relative price (of cloth in terms of wine) is $\frac{p_{c}}{p_{w}} = \frac{a_{lc}}{a_{lw}}$. Where $a_{lc}$ and $a_{lw}$ are the unit labor requirements for the production of cloth and wine respectively (think of these as being the inverse of productivity in each sector). These prices are below $\frac{a_{lc}^*}{a_{lw}^*}$. The Home country has a lower opportunity cost in the production of cloth. So given these prices, i.e., $\frac{p_{c}}{p_{w}} = \frac{a_{lc}}{a_{lw}}$ and $\frac{p_{c}}{p_{w}} < \frac{a_{lc}^*}{a_{lw}^*}$, I understand that Home will produce both goods (i.e., not specialise) while Foreign finds better to specialise in wine (since the relative price of wine is higher than the opportunity cost). But how does Foreign obtain cloth? Since Home is not exporting any cloth and there are only two countries, how can one of them be an autarky while the other specialises in one of the goods? 

Consider two countries: Home and Foreign that produce two goods, cars and wheat. The production technologies are such that: $q_{c} = K_{c}^{0.5} L_{c}^{0.5}$ and $q_{w} = 0.5 K_{w}^{0.5}L_{w}^{0.5}$ for Home. And for Foreign: $q_{c}^{*} = 0.5 K_{c}^{0.5*} L_{c}^{0.5*}$ and $q_{w} = K_{w}^{0.5*}L_{w}^{0.5*}$ $K_{c}$ denotes the amount of capital used in the production of cars. The asterix denotes the Foreign country. The endowments are: $K_{c} + K_{w} = K_{c}^{*} + K_{w}^* = 1$ and $L_{c} + L_{w} = L_{c}^{*} + L_{w}^* = 1$ Preferences are homothetic and identical between the countries and given by $\frac{D_{c}}{D_{w}} = \frac{p_{w}}{p_{c}}$. So both countries have the same endowments but their production technologies differ. The first question is to find the autarky quantities and relative prices. This I have managed to do by setting up the profit maximisation problem in each sector, then finding the wage-rental ratio. And seeing as the Cobb-Douglas exponents are the same, I know that equal amounts of labor and capital will be used in the production of each good. I won't include the algebra but here are my wages and rental rates in each sector. For cars: $w = 0.5 p_{c} (\frac{K_{c}}{L_{c}})^{0.5}$ $\quad$ (1) $r = 0.5 p_{c} (\frac{L_{c}}{K_{c}})^{0.5}$ $\quad$ (2) $w^* = 0.25 p_{c}^{*} (\frac{K_{c}^*}{L_{c}^*})^{0.5}$ $\quad$(3) $r^* = 0.25 p_{c} (\frac{L_{c}^*}{K_{c}^*})^{0.5}$ $\quad$ (4) And for the wheat sector: $w = 0.25 p_{w} (\frac{K_{w}}{L_{w}})^{0.5}$ $\quad$ (5) $r = 0.25 p_{w} (\frac{L_{w}}{K_{w}})^{0.5}$ $\quad$ (6) $w^* = 0.5 p_{w}^{*} (\frac{K_{w}^*}{L_{w}^*})^{0.5}$ $\quad$(7) $r^* = 0.5 p_{w} (\frac{L_{w}^*}{K_{w}^*})^{0.5}$ $\quad$ (8) For the autarky case, dividing (1) by (3) and setting $K_{c} = L_{c}$ shows that for Home, the relative price, $\frac{p_{c}}{p_{w}} = 0.5$. Similarly for Foreign, $\frac{p_{c}^*}{p_{w}^*} = 2$. And using the preference function I can find the quantities of each good produced. It is finding the free-trade relative price and quantities that is causing me some trouble. I know that in free-trade factor and output prices equalise and that world demand equals world production. I also know that Home has a comparative advantage in cars and Foreign in wheat (given the autarky relative prices). But I have tried for hours now to manipulate (1)-(8) but without much progress. Any suggestions as to how I can proceed? 

While I agree with this, I don't agree with what he wrote in the picture I linked to. I.e that case 1 represents the Ricardian regime and case 2 the non-RIcardian regime. In case 1 there is no correlation between current primary surplus ($s_t$) and future surpluses ($s_{t+k})$, thus the real value of debt is constant. How is this consistent with the quote above? To me, case 3, i.e the one where $\text{corr}(s_{t},s_{t+k}) < 0$ should be the Ricardian regime because high surpluses today imply low surpluses tomorrow. Have I misunderstood the author or did he mean to write 'Case 2 and 3 allow for regime identification'? 

I am reading Lucas (1980) and I am a bit confused about the way he formulates the utility function. So there is one non-storable good that comes in $n$ colours and one unit of labor produces $y$ units of any color. He says: 

You have the government's flow budget constraint (re-written in real terms): $b_{t} + m_{t} + \tau_{t} = g + \frac{m_{t-1}}{\pi_{t}} + R_{t-1}\frac{b_{t-1}}{\pi_{t}}$ (1) Now all you need to do is substitute (2) and the policy rules (also, I don't think Leeper's utility function had a $\delta$ but that's not important) and linearise. I.e linearise: $b_{t} +δc[\frac{R_{t}}{R_{t}-1}] + (\gamma_{0} + \gamma_{1}b_{t-1} + \psi_{t}) = g +\frac{δc[\frac{R_{t-1}}{R_{t-1}-1}]}{\pi_{t}} + (\alpha_{0} + \alpha_{1} \pi_{t-1} + \beta \theta_{t-1}) \frac{b_{t-1}}{\pi_{t}}$ (2) Note: I left some $R_{t}$ and $R_{t-1}$ in there but you will have to substitute the monetary policy rule there as well. Then all you do is a Taylor approximation around the deterministic steady state. Just a warning, the algebra will be very hairy, it took me several tries to get it right. OP requested some more reading on this topic so I'll add a list here: [1] Loyo (1999), Tight Money Paradox on the Loose: A Fiscalist Hyperinflation [2] Woodford (1998), Public Debt and the Price Level [3] Woodford (2000), Fiscal Requirements for Price Stability [4] Leeper & Leith (2016), Understanding Inflation as a Joint Monetary-Fiscal Phenomenon I have many more but start with these. 

I am reading Walsh's (2003) book on monetary economics. Specifically the chapter on money in utility function. I understand the basics of a value functions but I can't seem to get the same results as the author. Where I.e the per capita budget constraint. He then finds an expression for $w_{t+1}$: This is the first source of my confusion. Previously he defines output per worker as a function of capital per worker, i.e $y_{t}=f(\frac{k_{t-1}}{1+n})$ where $n$ is the population growth rate. But all of a sudden he changes it to $\frac{f(k_{t-1})}{1+n}$. I am aware that there are many typos in this book, is this just one of them or am I missing something trivial? Either way, he uses the budget constraint to express $k_{t}$ as $w_{t}-c_{t}-m_{t}-b_{t}$ and the definition of $w_{t+1}$ to express the value function as:
