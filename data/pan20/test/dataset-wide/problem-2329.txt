You could use it, but it probably wouldn't be very convenient. That fluffy stuff is basically Marabou, which is one of the most popular fly tying materials, the difference between the soft hookless barbs found on your hackles, and the barbs found on semiplumes like Marabou, is the rachis, the shaft of the feather the barbs attach to. You could make use of it, but you'd exert a lot of extra effort compared to making a fly with a new semiplume. If you're conscious about wasting materials, just remember that the feathers you're using are already a byproduct to begin with. They don't harvest birds for feathers, they harvest them for meat, the feathers just happen to be usable in some other markets as well, but would be garbage otherwise. If that still doesn't satisfy your conscience, then start saving just the hookless barbs until you have enough to re-stuff a pair of mittens. You could turn a pair of cheap synthetic mitts into a nice light pair of down-ish mitts, then brag about how you made them out of all the scraps from the hundreds of flies you've tied. 

Personally, in regularly visited areas I almost always lower. It's my choice, but if I'm belaying someone who wants to rappel I do as they wish. Some exceptions to the "climber's choice" rule would be if the area's guidebook says otherwise, or if the local climbers all rappel ("do as the locals do" is always a good rule of thumb). In seldom-visited areas, I generally rappel. 

Build a snow anchor, then transfer the load to your anchor. Holding your partner's weight for the entire duration of a self rescue would be a bad idea. Building an anchor is independent of what your partner is doing. Always build an anchor. On glaciers, you'll most likely build a deadman anchor with an ice axe. It's possible to do a deadman with a ski, but it's time consuming and probably impossible to do alone while holding your partner. Crevasse rescue with a team of two just adds to the complexity. At a minimum, you'll need to be able to arrest the fall, build an anchor, transfer the load, check on your partner, build a haul system, and effect the rescue. Oh, and you'll be by yourself. 

Leeches swim in still water, they don't live in trees, and they don't dwell on the ground. They attach themselves to bare skin, you won't even notice them do it. Last time I had a leech latch onto me I didn't find it until that night when I went to bed and found it mostly dried up attached to my toe when I took my socks of to get into my sleeping bag. (it was just a small one, somehow I didn't notice it when I put my socks on after getting out of the water). I think what you're thinking about is perhaps not leeches, but ticks. Ticks will climb up onto tall grass or shrubs and hang out with their long arms up in the air just waiting for something to walk by that they can grab onto. They then crawl up your body and will either go under your shirt and attach to your back (the only place I've ever had them attach to me) or they'll climb right up to your neck or get into your hair and latch on to your scalp. You might notice them crawling on you, but you usually find them after they're already attached. To get them off all you have to do is get a good hold on their bodies, give them a gentle tug–just enough to raise your skin to where you can really feel it pulling on you–and then hold it there, they will eventually lose their grip and come off. Don't try to rip them off, just hold on and and wait for them to let go, if you rip them off you could rip their bodies from the head that's lodged inside you, which will likely get infected, and I don't know about you but the idea of having a severed head stuck under my skin kinda grosses me out. Leech: 

The clove hitch is probably what you're looking for. You can even tie it directly on the branch/beam/bar without worrying about adding a carabiner. You could also tie it to the carabiner, adjust the length, and clip the carabiner to something else. The clove hitch is one of the most under-utilized climbing knots out there. It's infinitely adjustable because you're directly using the rope/cord, and you can tie it on any number of things. 

Generally when doing multi-pitch climbs, I prefer to just climb with a light pack. However, sometimes that's just not possible and the pack(s) must be hauled instead. What are some good ways to haul a pack up a pitch? Where does it best fit in around belaying the second? What are good ways to avoid getting packs stuck? I'm thinking particularly of something that's light enough to haul hand-over-hand with some breaks in there, and speed of hauling is important. 

Clean all of the old wax of of your skis, first scrape off as much as you can, then use your solvent to clean of what remains (It's best if you do this inside with warm skis). Select the appropriate wax for the conditions you're going to be skiing in. Either apply indoors on warm skis, or outdoors on cold skis. If you have to travel a distance to go skiing then this is probably best done once you get to the trail. Apply stripes of your chosen wax across the width of the kick zone of your ski (typically indicated on the sides of newer skies with arrows). How far you space the stripes depends on the temperature of wax, warmer waxes are softer so you can space them more, whereas really hard grey wax (only crazy people ski in grey wax conditions) is like applying a rock to your bases. Don't gob it on, you're going to be applying several layers. How big you make your kick zone can depend on where you are in the temperature range for the wax if you're like me and only use one type: Warmer=bigger kick zone; colder=smaller kick zone. Work the wax into your bases using your cork until it doesn't look like it's there anymore, and your base is smooth (I use different corks for each type of wax, one cork has two sides so you can use one cork for two wax types). Reapply until you have 4 or 5 layers. 

This, probably more than any issue in climbing, has generated more discussion, heated debates, and vitriol (especially on the internet) than any other issue in climbing. Both sides (lower vs. rappel) are equally ardent in their belief that their way is the One True Way. Unfortunately, both sides are wrong. My rule is simple: Climber's choice. You should choose the method you prefer and believe is safer, and you should do it the same way each time to minimize the chance of a serious climber error. (You should still know both ways.) If you are the last climber going up and will clean a route, it's important to tell your belayer what you intend before you leave the ground. This way, both parties have a clear idea of what will happen. This can be helpful if communication is hard from the top, and decreases the chance of a miscommunication. When you get to the top, your command to your belayer should be clear and completely unambiguous: 

I actually had a backyard board like that back in the early 90s, you can wear whatever boots you want with that board. Snowboard boots were developed for supportive snowboard bindings, those old boards didn't have supportive bindings, just toe straps like what you found on water skis and surf boards. 

So I've been thinking about developing some canyons around here for canyoneering, but while scrambling up Red Rocks Canyon in Waterton and looking at all the large logs jammed rather high up in the canyon, it occurred to me that depending on where you would want to place your bolt, it could end up under water during spring run off. My first thought was that I would simply need to place the bolt up higher so it could stay dry, but looking at where I suspected the high water mark to be in some places, you'd be bolting too high for anyone to ever reach it. Can fixed protection be placed in areas which are under water for part of the season? 

Will Gadd's book Ice & Mixed Climbing states that if you mess up the first attempt at a V-thread, start over in clean ice. This includes if your screw holes intersect only partway down the hole, the two holes didn't intersect, or the distance between the holes isn't large enough. Practicing making V-threads on the ground is much better than trying to figure it out on rappel when it's cold, dark, and everyone is soaked. A good rule of thumb for all anchors (but especially rappel anchors) is to make the best anchor possible with what you have available. Fortunately, on most ice climbs starting over means moving over a foot or two to solid ice. In some cases, building a "textbook" anchor may not be possible. If you have to use an anchor that is less than optimal, make a backup anchor and clip the rope to this backup in case your V-thread fails. You want the backup to be relatively taught but all of the weight should be on the primary V-thread (just a little bit loose). The last person will remove the backup when they rappel. This Petzl video shows a good example of this (at 4 minutes). 

Q: Would it work? A: Probably, tobacco is toxic to Leeches, but the problem with rubbing cigarette tobacco all over your legs is you will also absorb all of the manufactured additives and toxins put into the cigarette tobacco. You'd be better off using chewing tobacco. Tobacco accelerates coagulation and was used for its medicinal properties in the past. The leaves are still used today by some cattle ranchers to heal bruises on cows and stop bleeds. If you want to order just the leaves you can do so online: $URL$ Leeches inject an anticoagulant when they bite in order to prevent the blood from clotting so they can get a steady stream while they suck, and easily detach. It's for this reason that leech bites tend to bleed for a long time. I suspect it's the hypercoagulation provided by tobacco that makes it toxic to leeches, but before you start rubbing the stuff all over your body, I recommend you check out Leech socks: 

I'm interested in both the binary case (e.g., is this boot still waterproof or not?) and the more analog case (e.g., this softshell will keep you dry in a rain storm for about X hours). 

After using tape gloves for crack climbing, I always have some tape gunk left over on my skin. While it doesn't hurt and goes away a few days of rigorous scrubbing, it doesn't look super great at the office on Monday morning. How can I remove this gunk left on my skin? I'm looking for something that's relatively painless, and won't hurt when it gets in cuts on the hand/fingers. No, switching to rubber gloves is not on the table. 

The last point is often overlooked in discussions on roped travel safety. There are many cases where a rope is superfluous on some part of a climb, but a short difficult section is coming up. When this happens, the climbers are left to either (a) stop, pull out the rope, rope up, etc. or (b) proceed unroped. One wastes time, the other is unsafe. Being short-roped allows the first climber to say "hey, stop and wait here", drop hand coils, climb up a moderately difficult section quickly, then use a basic belay (e.g., a rock horn, a quick cam, boot axe, etc.). When a longer difficult section is coming up, you can even start dropping kiwi coils to have a full rope length available. To recap, the only times I will short-rope are:
