Along with trekking and camping, I am too involved in musical instruments that I play. And, I always have had a thought of carrying my six-string with me on some long hike for entertainment during I camp at some site. ( I have so far always have taken care of safety issues/procedures related Campsite Selection), but still I wonder if its is absolutely safe (with active Wildlife perspective) to play musical instruments like Harp/harmonica or a flute or even a guitar in wilderness? I would love to carry my Harmonica or a Flute with me ( being extremely portable as compared to a guitar), but what worries me more is that usually such wind instruments generate frequencies that are audible over a longer distance as compared to a guitar which is a string instrument (but hardly portable). Animals that are usually seen are: Wild Boars, Deer, Wild Dogs, Hyena. Very Rarely seen but confirmed (by unofficial sources like Farmers and Woodcutters frequently visiting the area) of being there: Leopard, Jaguar, Sloth Bears, Tiger(But I doubt on these except Sloth Bears) 

Muscles play an important role. They contract, expand when you need them too. Have you ever worked out? In early days of work-outs when you worked heavily on biceps, you may have felt pain in the triceps. Why? Thats because of muscle contraction. Basically, two types: Eccentric Contraction and Concentric Contraction. When someone pose for Biceps (like, a 90o angle between shoulder and the biceps, and the same between the biceps and the rest of the arm), what contraction he/she had? Both! Concentric Contraction at the Bicep and Eccentric Contraction at the Triceps. Why Triceps pained more? If you can imagine, Concentric Contraction contracts you muscle and Eccentric Contraction expands your muscles (in length mostly). I am more concerned about center of gravity (balance, speaking vaguely), When I am descending than when I am ascending. The center of gravity shifts on foot when I am descending since I don't want to let my body tip-off due to pace. Internally, muscles of the shin contracts eccentrically to control the descent of the toes after I place my heel down. If that doesn't happen, I will no longer have control on how fast my leg goes down and I would hurt myself awfully with every step downwards. Its all gravity, when I walk downwards, descending a step, my knees are always always always straight. Thats because of the gravity. But as I step on surface, because the quadriceps contract eccentrically to control my knees from bending too much, there a spring action at the knees.. That helps to deal with impact. Quadriceps Muscles are group of 4 muscles around thigh. The reason I mentioned about Quadriceps is to hint you that its not just the Calf you are worried about. Its the whole mechanism! If you think, its just the calf, try heavy running on a flat hard surface for a long time. You'd complain more about Shins than Calf and Knees. If it goes beyond what you can and should deal with, you might want to consult your physiotherapist. And, you might want to read about DOMS: Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness. 

Since you and I belong to the same geography for trekking/hiking, I think I can add 2 cents to this. I typically follow a similar pattern from what Charlie answered above. I typically avoid going slow on short sections of highly inclined trails. For such ascends what I do is: 

Looking at the product, I don't quite comprehend why it would seem difficult to add a second reservoir, unless you aren't talking about a second hydration pack itself. I think I trek around in similar conditions (India) as you do, and I typically face this issue, and for that I do the simplest thing I can think of. Carry 3 bottles (1L each). When hydration bladder get empty, I refill it with water in the bottles. I plan to upgrade from hard bottles to collapsible water packs which I can place where I find enough volume for it to accommodate. 

Bears are mostly attracted by smell of food. That is why we are supposed to keep the food items in airtight and sealed packs or preferably finish up all the food (cooking and consuming) far away from the campsite. People usually tend to follow this protocol. But does this all apply to Body lotions, Deodorants, Scented soaps, Face washes and perfumes? I believe bears are just keen animals who tend to get attracted towards things that have strong odor/smell. 

Side winding Very common. Almost every other snake we snake, does a Side-winding locomotion. Do not compare extremities by getting confused with the term Side-Winder. Have you seen a snake moving in mud or sand which disables a snake push against an irregular surface, like stones, sticks, etc? In side-winding, head and tail are the supports for the snakes movement to push against. Its body is lifted off the ground to move sideways. It keeps on head and tail into the same cross direction of its body. Observing carefully, you'll see that parts of its body positioned in one direction are never lifted off the ground, while the other segments are lifted up, resulting in a equidistant pattern drawn on the sand/mud. So, its almost half the friction of its body against the surface, lesser work. 

I do use those compression sleeves when I am going for cycling. I have observed that with the sleeves that I have, there is a gradual difference in the elasticity of the material towards the middle of the arm sleeve, such that the compression is tighter at the lower endpoints, like wrists in case of arm sleeves and ankles in case of leg sleeves. The idea that the Decathlon guy explained me is to have the progressive/gradual compression on the targeted area of muscles. The science says, When you are exerting your arm/legs, you are going to need oxygenated blood which arteries carry from heart to limbs, so its important that the de-oxygenated blood flows back to the heart, which is carried by veins to heart, so that it gets oxygenated in lungs. Have you observed what a physician does when he/she measures your blood pressure? He/She tightens a band, use the rubber bubble to pump air into the band. Why? Because, an optimal level of consistent and controlled compression results in dilation of the walls of the arteries, and increasing the blood flow through them. Additional information: While walls of Arteries dilate due to compression, walls of Veins constrict under compression action, which helps to increase the velocity of blood flow through them. Quickening up this process would result in a faster process of converting de-oxygenated blood into oxygenated blood and sent over arteries. This entire thing would result in provision of more oxygenated blood per average time. When you climb, you are making your arms work harder. Thats one of the reasons to have a numb arm, cramping fingers after an exhaustive climb. Cramping fingers can be a consequence of lack of Oxygenated Blood supplied to them. With Compression Arm Sleeves, you aid in the purpose of ensuring that your arms would not go numb too soon, or at least earlier than when you are not using them. Like all other users you might think that I am blabbering more about cycling and not climbing, but to be fair, I've never tried them on a climb. But I have used them extensively during mountain-biking and when I play cricket, being a fast bowler, I've always preferred having them on eve since I used for the first time. Allows me more spells to bowl before I feel my forearm hurting and/or start loosing pace. Its no harm to related the Blood Flow concept with the Compression Arm Sleeves, be it for any sport where you count a lot on arm workout. If you ask me about why people don't use them when the workout in gyms, I've got no answer to you. I have seen the difference that I don't feel my elbows that exhausted when I wear a compression sleeve. May be because its like a strapped elbow? Muscular vibration during physical activity contributes to fatigue. Apart from the science behind it I have observed that there is absolutely no possibility of the chafing that one may feel due to compression, like you may feel when you put on the socks that are smaller than what suits you, or may be undergarment would be an ideal example of chafing due to skin compression. Apart from that, these help you with: 

I also gave this option a thought. Cleaning it up with strong potable soda water. This has to be done when the precipitation is moist, and not dry. That would flush it off at least better then water. 

When you mentioned tall grass, snakes weren't the first thing that came to my mind. Snakes can hide in plain site, let aside the taller grass. They typically want to hide, unless you aren't really entering their hide-outs. For snakes that you find in Western Ghats, they typically have their habitat in thickets and holes. Very rarely you'll come across a snake in a grassland, typically when its their basking time, and I haven't seen a snake basking in such tall grass, because it doesn't make sense. The only possibility that you come across snake if it is passing through, but eventually like most of the times it will know that something (you) are coming closer. An argument can be made that if it is so, why people in India usually get bitten by a snake or come across one while they are in a sugarcane farm or a rice farming? And, the only possible valid reason I can think of is presence of rats and other preys that snakes happily feast on. The other animals you need to be aware of are hyenas and wolves. I have heard of and met people who have excelled at walking without making any noise. When I tried the same over a period of time and finally succeeded at it, I came across a Bison, not exactly in that taller grass, but in a similar region. So, be loud if you want to make sure you keep them away if they are around at all. Apart from snakes there are other things you want to be aware of while walking in tall grass. The most important of them is direction. In that case I usually refer a hill or a distant mountain as a landmark before getting into such tall grass. Additionally you can refer your GPS application periodically to check if you are heading into the direction you are supposed to, if you are equipped with it. This might be specific to the region we trek/hike around: Taller grass in Western Ghat (Well, most part of it) is seasonal. I consider season before I plan any such routes, but obviously if find yourself in a situation that you have to pass through one such long region, bang your feet (not such that it starts hurting your knees) as you walk and make sure you are with: 

I have never heard of someone legally setting up a fence with a strong potential good enough to be fatal. That said, it is very much a possibility that the fence might severely injure (or worst case kill) a dog or some small animal (Pets when hiking?). In such a case, one indeed needs to be worried about an electric fence. First things first. If responsible owners (or authorities) have bothered to put a board of instruction which says that it is a live fence, trust them and do not take a calculated risk. Secondly, Look out for people around who might know if it is a live fence. Confirm and proceed. You may receive horrible advice such as throwing up some metal on it, if it sparks, it is alive. That might work as well, but then the owner would cause you more trouble than the fence itself. If I am in such a situation, my best bet would be the humming sound they make. Its a minor hum, you will have to get closer carefully in order to hear that. Another way that I can think of is a bit inhumane. Grab a metal wire if you can, fix one end of the wire in the ground very close to the fence, grab an earthworm, rest it on the wire, put the other end of the wire on the fence carefully such that you are not in contact with the wire when it gets in contact with the fence. If the worm twists into a coil, its a live fence. How much does a tester cost? I always have one in my waist pouch, comes handy in thousand ways, right from fixing solar lamp battery boxes (I meant tightening the screws on the boxes) on the trail (if they are loose), till opening a beverage glass-bottle if I don't have an opener.
