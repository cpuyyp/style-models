Specifically, he made a major impression of Yoga on at the first Parliament of the World's Religions, which was held at Chicago in 1893. This event was scheduled to take advantage of the unprecedented popularity of the World's Columbian Exposition, an world fair held at the same time in Chicago. That worked to the Swami's advantage in terms of promoting Yoga. 

This is inferred from historical records. In his Histories, the Greek historian Polybius described Hannibal's passage through the Pyrenees as: 

This viewpoint has had a lengthy pedigree. Robespierre's execution was where the great Jules Michelet concluded his foundational narrative of the French Revolution. Later prominent historians Arlbert Mathiez and Jean Jaurès, identified the Thermidorian Reaction as terminating the Revolution. 

In addition to U-boats, the German E-boats saw relatively extensive action early on. In the first few days, they were able to engage Allied convoys, albeit with heavy losses. During these operations, the E-boats sank several Allied vessels including SS Brackenfield, the Partridge, and SS Dungrange as well as some LCT's and LST's. By 14 June however the E-boats force had been depleted. 

Lastly, native Lithuanians bred abundantly under the Soviet occupation. Both Latvia and Estonia saw a reduction in their national majority due to a slow birth rate - Latvians increased by only 3.4% from 1959 to 1970. In contrast, the native Lithuanians outbred the Russian settlers with double digit growth over the same period. 

Those were the ecclesiastical states of the Holy Roman Empire. Germany as we know it today did not really exist in 1648 - the territories in question were part of the Holy Roman Empire, a highly fragmented feudal polity. Fiefs within the Empire could receive a privilege known as imperial immediacy, whereby they become subject to no other authority except the emperor's. They were de facto independent states despite nominally being imperial vassals. Immediacy could be granted to a wide range of imperial subjects, most prmoinently hereditary feudal lords, but also cities, knights, and ecclesiastical figures. The video appears to be depicting the ecclesiastical states ruled by the last group, which included bishops or abbots and abbesses. Of course, in reality none of these had anything to do with the Papal States, which refer to territories under the direct and sovereign rule of the Pope. Most of the ecclesiastical states, especially the abbeys, were tiny; but several prince-bishoprics of the empire were sizeable states. Prior to the Empire's territorial losses and subsequent mediatisation during the French Revolution, there were some 65 ecclesiastical imperial vassals, controlling 12% of its area: 

There is two questions here, since "political elite" did not (and does not) equate to membership in congress. In terms of the physical overlap of the two Congresses, let's examine the composition of the First United States Congress. In the Senate, only four senators out of 25 (+3 replacements), or 16% (14.3% counting replacements) had not previously served in the Continental or Confederation Congresses: 

Which placed restrictions of "international law and criminal law" on what the Austrian government could do under the excuse of pursuing terrorists. 

One major milestone was reached on 1924, when the electoral landslide of the Constitutionalist parties caused the elders to nominate Katō Takaaki. This established a customary rule the leader of the biggest party in the Diet to be appointed Prime Minister. However the genrō continued to formally choose the a candidate, even though the death of Matsukata Masayoshi later that year left Saionji the sole remaining elder. 

The design is that of the "sailing ship" 10 Deutsche Mark note, a banknote first issued in 1960. The front features a 16th century painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder. On a real version of the note, the reverse would have depicted the German navy sailing ship Gorch Fock. These notes were withdrawn from circulation in 1990. 

Available evidence suggests that the Spanish Flu was "seeded" around the world in a number of localised outbreaks well before the mass deaths that occurred in 1918. 

John Willoughby's "distressing account of an undisciplined and marauding mob" (according to a review) discuss this in the immediate post war years, citing Morris MacGregor's Integration of the Armed Forces. 

Short answer: points 4-6 were unreasonable to the point of being unacceptable, because they gave Vienna so much power over Serbia that it amounted to a forfeiture of Serbian independence. This isn't unique to the time period or Serbia. Countries generally are not happy to subjugate themselves to a hated enemy. Whether they could afford to resist is another matter, of course; but whether they bow to reality or not doesn't diminish the humiliation of harsh terms. Lastly, Serbia indeed tried to appease Vienna. It (on paper, anyway, and conditionally) accepted every demand except one. 

This situation can be contrasted In Southern France, where the stem family system eventually developed during the Late Middle Ages. That pattern became predominant by the onset of the Early Modern period. 

Despite what the other answer states (at the time of writing), these were not merely "groups of citizens got together and voted amongst themselves for things". Rather, they were fully legitimate constitutional government bodies of the Kingdom of France, and they dealt with the royal court in that capacity. One of their responsibilities was taxation. Though the king could tax the pays d'élections at will, technically the provincial assemblies formally voted their consent in the pays d'états. In practice, though, the king essentially determined the amount without their input. 

The United States abandoned the gold standard on 15 August 1971. Since then it has been using fiat money, which is not backed by any commodity. It derives its value solely from government authority. This is sometimes also known as a "managed currency standard". 

Basically, the Pseudohistory Channel or whoever you heard this from is simply wrong. Rather than a gold standard, the framers of the US Constitution tried to introduce a bimetallic standard - that is, a monetary standard based on both gold and silver. The Constitution states: 

Another point: I would argue there was a certain degree of doublethink going on during the late empire. Even while acknowledging the monarch and empire, Romans continued cling to the fantasy of a republic. When the Western Roman Empire finally fell in 476 A.D., the Senate sent the imperial regalia to Constantinople along with a delegation. The deputies carried with them an "unanimous" message addressed to the Eastern Emperor Zeno, in which the Senate: 

In terms of overall strategic situation, Shu had the additional advantage that Wei's armies were poised for an invasion of the South. In fact, Wu's forces were facing a war on two fronts, leading the following exchange soon after the battle: 

The other example listed in the question, however, has a firmer basis. A historical case of cannibalism did occur during the First Crusade, at Ma‘arra in 1098. The incident was frequently attested to by contemporary writers, some of which identified the cannibals as "a group of pilgrims called the Tafurs". 

This is really more like a whole list of questions... 1. Why was de Grailly granted this title, which was apparently used by only a few families, and not some other title? I think there's a bit of confusion here. The prefix of Captal was the traditional title for the lords of Buch. Edward III granted Jean III de Grailly the fief of Buch which came with it the feudal title of Captal de Buch. He didn't randomly have him titled captal by itself. 2. Was captal used in the same way as other titles, such as Duke or Viscount, where the title is used in place of the name? Yes: 

Saudi Arabia and Iraq had in fact reached an agreement on partitioning the Saudi-Iraqi Neutral Zone in 1981. This was ratified as a general border treaty in 1983. This created the de factor border depicted in the above map, as dashed lines. Notice it cuts through the Neutral Zone at the centre. 

It seems to me that the Democratic Party was not named per se. Instead, it gradually settled upon its present name more or less between 1824 and 1844. As is well known, the original Republican Party largely collapsed into personality-centric factions after 1824. The resulting fledgling parties, however, continued to profess membership in the old Republican Party. Accordingly, the Jacksonian faction (and future Democratic Party) formally considered itself the Republican Party. This official line remained the dominant narrative into the 1830s. For example, their first national convention in Baltimore, 1832, was titled, "A Convention of Republican Delegates From the Several States in the Union". There was no mention of a Democratic Party yet. At the same time, names were more fluid on a regional level, where some incorporated the originally-derisive Democratic as a prefix. This wasn't a new development: local organisations of the party seemed to have been doing that since as early as 1798. The resulting name, the Democratic-Republican Party, was rare during the early 1800s but gained ground after 1824. Notably, it became the chief self-identification of Jacksonian supporters in Pennsylvania during 1824. 

This theory is not the most popular with the public, but it enjoys respectable support among experts. None other than Truman's ambassador to the USSR George Kennan, who was once a leading advocate of containment, argued after the fall that: 

The German argument was not a stretch to make in 1914. Countries did not (and do not) mobilise for fun. In an age of mass conscript armies, mobilisation was the key stage in the ramp up to war. The tight coupling of mobilisation with war was such that it was effectively regarded as an act of war in and of itself. In Russia specifically, 

Unsurprisingly, the high praise the ritual attracted made a sati widow desirable for her surviving family. For this reason it is not wholly unheard of for women to be coerced into committing sati, either by force or persuasion. Even some members of royalty, for example, were pressured into committing sati for political reasons. In general, it has been observed that the widow's family would be more likely to pressure the woman into sati for fear that she might bring shame upon them. 

@lins314159 is correct: the Eastern Zhou's fall began with the demise of the Western Zhou. Unlike its predecessor, the Eastern Zhou was never able to control its vassals. The precipitous drop in royal authority was caused by the collapse of the king's moral authority, his ineptitude, and the internal bickering of the court. This doomed the Eastern Zhou by creating a power vacuum for ambitious vassals to expand their own territories at the expense of royal power, kickstarting a vicious cycle of decline. Moral Authority Following the eastward move, Zhou's moral authority and general prestige crumbled. But this has less to do with the barbarian invasion itself than one might reasonably think1. As @lins314159 mentioned, King You was killed by a coalition of rebel lords and barbarians led by the Marquis of Shen, father-in-law to King You and grandfather of King Ping. However, the future King Ping fled to Shen in 777 B.C. as the Crown Prince of Zhou, three years before being disinherited and five years before fighting erupted. Thus, when King You was killed in the ensuing conflict, it exposed King Ping to charges of patricide and regicide - the two most serious crimes of Ancient China. 

Request vs Demand There is a difference between a theoretical right, and the practical ability to exercise that right. In theory, you are correct that the Confederation Congress was empowered to set tax quotas and due dates for the States.[1] In reality however, Congress had no actual means of enforcing this. 

Jaffa was a predominantly Arab city with a large Arab majority. Carving Jaffa out as an Arab enclave was a land-efficient way of strengthening the proportion of Jews in the proposed Jewish state. The committee feared that, when Bedouin populations were taken into account, Jews would be rendered a minority within their own state under the original partition plan. 

Compared to the Russian ambassador to Britain, the President of the United States at the time received a paltry $25,000. While Adams was advocating raises for diplomats like himself, there's little doubt that European governments supported their representatives well. For example, Britain's ambassadors enjoyed expense accounts to the sizes of: 

Therefore, faced with repression from without, and division within, Socialism in America fractured into disarray by the start of the 1920s. 

4. Western Canada The fur trade was not limited to the Hudson's Bay region. By the late 18th century, trade posts were being established in New Caledonia by both the Hudson's Bay Company and its Montreal competitor, the North West Company. Similarly, the Hudson's Bay Company also extended its operations into the North-Western Territory in search of more fur trade. For most of this time the British population was minimal. In the late 1850s and early 1860s, a number of gold finds occurred in the region. The sudden influx of American miners prompted the British government to formally organise and incorporate New Caledonia as the Crown Colony of British Columbia, and soon after formally assert British claims to the North-Western Territory. 

Addressing the link you cited, Tokugawa Ieyasu taking no part in fighting is not the same as opposing the war in general. In fact, Ieyasu was the one who proposed the invasion strategy that Hideyoshi adopted. When combat operations began, Tokugawa troops were part of the reserves who stayed in Kyushu. But, as you said, whether or not Ieyasu actually opposed Hideyoshi's plan, he definitely ended up staying out of the fighting. The immediate (and official) reason is because the Tokugawa clan is occupied. Keep in mind Ieyasu had only just been relocated to the newly vacated lands of the the Hojo clan. Hideyoshi's (ultimately failed) move uprooted the Tokugawa clan from their native land, and forced them to under the difficult process of integrating themselves into the Kanto provinces. Not only did Ieyasu now need to settle his retainers and their families, he also have to establish an administration in his new territories. Furthermore, he would have to pacify the provinces. Moreover, not only did the Tokugawa clan face a great deal of work, having been generously rewarded already they also cannot expect to be rewarded with any more land. This contrasts with the western daimyos, who were looking forward to being rewarded with Korean conquests. Expending soldiers in that war thus would have been a waste for Tokugawa ambitions. Fortunately, because of Hideyoshi's ill-fated gift, Ieyasu could plead to be exempted from military service using the home front's difficulties as an excuse. So while the western daimyos whittled their strength away on the fields of Korea for eight bloody years, the Tokugawa armies rested and managed their territoy of Kanto into the basis for their later victory over the Toyotomi clan.
