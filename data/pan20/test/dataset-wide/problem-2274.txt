You can use the common technique with the poles to measure the slope angle like discribed by @EverythingRightPlace. There is also a ski-pole-sticker that you can attach to your pole and then simply read the angle with a single pole (found on this website). There are also several smart phone apps for your smart phone to measure the angle of a slope. These Apps are only an additional help for the existing physical methods and are not completely reliable. for WindowsPhone for Android for iPhone 

A friend of mine asked a experienced long distance hiker, how to drink during such a hike. The answer was, drink 0.1l water per hour and then you are fine. Is this correct and can anyone add some facts to this answer? Can I stay hydrated over several days with a this given amount of water? What are factors to drink more water and how much more e.g. (wind, activity, temperature, ...)? Side question:Are there studies on this topic? 

This is what backpacks like the Osprey Atmos were designed for. They're slightly elevated/separated from the users back so that ventilation can improve. However, these sorts of backpacks (not just the Atmos) aren't designed to carry heavier loads that conform to the users back. This is because the further the pack is from your back, the more difficult it will be to carry. So an Atmos with 25 pounds of gear feels heavier than a backpack that sticks to your back carrying the exact same items and weight. If you're done with work in the afternoon and you don't have to head back or be somewhere else where nice attire is required, you should wear a synthetic shirt such as a running shirt or lightweight merino wool shirt. Both these fabrics will help move the moisture away and you won't be as warm since you'll only have one layer. If that still doesn't satisfy your thirst and you really want to save money, take some cardboard, roll it up. and tape it to the back of your bag with some strong duct tape. Do this for the middle, bottom, and top and you've got a DIY ventilation system. I guarantee it wont last long nor be very comfortable. 

Just a suggestion, you could try putting a small amount of something abrasive (such as rock salt or perhaps gravel) into the bag, closing the bag securely with a zip tie on the zipper pulls & placing it in a clothes drier on the Fluff setting (no heat) for some period of time. Or if putting it in the drier makes you nervous, you could try agitating it by hand instead with an abrasive inside (the last thing you want are bits of gravel zooming around inside your drier.) I've of course never tried this, it is just what comes to mind... 

It looks like a Burl. They are natural non-harmful (think of them like scar tissue maybe, resulting from injury or infection) deformities in the grain of trees. Both hardwood & softwood trees can develop burls. (FWIW, I'd guess based on the bark & needles laying in the folds of the bark in the first picture that this tree is some sort of conifer.) 

I have trekking poles that I need to store in my back pack for air travel. However, the manual says for long term storage -- in my case, possibly days to a few weeks before I need to use them -- the locking mechanism should be opened/unlocked. But if I do this and put it in my bag, I'm afraid that the lock will catch something in side my bag or get damaged as it's going through the infinite maze of airport baggage. I'm also not quite sure how to prevent the tips from damaging anything else. For now, I've just duct taped them. So how do I store them? 

I would like to hike part of the Alps that go from France to Slovenia, but I'm not sure what type of equipment I'll need. I'm wondering if I need to bring crampons; I have Icetrekkers (Diamond Grip), which are more like traction cleats than crampons. Because I'll be backpacking, I would prefer to know in advance instead of bringing an extra two pounds that I won't end up using. Update: I'm not looking for equipment advice, which is why I didn't post this to OSE. I want to know if it can be hiked: Are the trails cleared for hikers? Are they even open? Or are the trails open, but not cleared, thus leaving the trails "hike-able" only to those with special equipment and training, such as mountaineers? Looking at the official Switzerland tourist page and other various pages, I was unable to find any such information. 

If you are looking at two piece rods because of their more compact size, you may also want to consider telescoping rods. I've had (3) telescoping rods & all but the Amazon-special-carbon-fiber job have served me well (the no-name brand amazon one broke into many pieces...), but I've loved the Mako Calypso 8' rod & my much smaller Shakespeare telescoper as well. With these rods too, some people will try to argue that they lack sensitivity, but I've felt the hits on these & landed anything from trout, perch, & crappie to a stripper off an ocean pier. Personally, I started experimenting with telescoping rods so I could more easily take them with me while backpacking & biking. Now, they are all I have! I have used two piece & one piece rods in the past, but that was so long ago I don't think I'd have any practical advice on what is out there now. I'd only note that as @That Idiot noted, multi piece rods do have a tendency to fly apart while casting or fighting a fish IF you don't check the connection between casts. (Note that this doesn't happen with telescoping rods). 

Walking technique You can save energy by not lifting your shoe higher then needed. And also how long steps you take. If it's steep try to make smaller steps to save energy. If you walk with poles use your poles with the correct length and technique as with cross-country-skiing, both for every step, one per step or asymmetric. Path planing I think you can save the most energy, when you use existing snowshoe paths. If there are no existing paths you can create a efficient path. When going uphill try to go as straight up as possible and use the heel lift. The heel lift helps you to walk uphill like on stairs and save energy. The reason to walk straight up is, to reduce distance where you need to walk trough heavy snow and also traversing is much more exhausting and frustrating. You have also crampons on your snowshoes and are not as much limited as touring-skis with skins on it (to an maximum angle of 30 degree). Keep also avalanche safety in mind and don't go for the steepest hills if the risk is increased. 

This got me curious, & using Expansion anchors in construction applications got me looking. While I couldn't find anything specific to climbing applications & submersion, I did find a reference to 304 or 316 stainless steel being used in submerged marine environments (harsher than typical freshwater) by boat builders. To my knowledge, no expansion anchors are available in 304 SS, so you would be limited to 316. I did come across this fastener selector tool which does specifically mention expansion anchors being used in submerged applications (in concrete). It is worth noting that even bolts installed in high, dry desert locations will need to be replaced sooner or later, so it is a good bet that the more extreme environment will shorten their lifespan no matter what you do. Also, maybe of more importance here, is making certain not to allow different alloys to come into contact with one another for extended periods. Do not use two different alloys for the bolt & the nut, & if you leave your hangers on the bolts when not in use, make sure that they are stainless steel also. Allowing dissimilar metals to remain in contact with water will result in Galvanic Corrosion. Which essentially means the rusting process will happen much faster. Just a thought, but you may want to be especially wary if the bolts are installed in sandstone with a high Iron content, as it seems to me that the Iron in the sandstone could react much more strongly with the stainless in a submerged environment. Anyone else have any observations on the effects (or non-effects) of Iron containing sandstone on anchor bolts? My two cents; give it a try. Maybe just very carefully inspect each bolt before use after a submersion. Edit: It may also be worth firing an email off to a manufacturer: $URL$ Edit: Edit: Just did, waiting for response. Edit(x3): Didn't hear back from Fixe, so I emailed Hilti customer service with the following question: 

While planning my trip, I was looking at some trails. They all say x amount of hours, but I didn't know if that was to the peak or if that was back and forth. What is the general rule? 

From my experience, I've only ever used hard shells simply because I've always thought they were made for more treacherous weather. However, I recently saw a video by Patagonia that claimed soft shells are more durable. Is this true? If so, why is it that hard shells are advised over soft shells for harsher weather then? 

I'm debating between carrying a larger water bottle and a smaller one. A larger one means I'll have to stop less to filter water, but it means I'll be carrying more, at least for a period of time. Even if that temporary added weight isn't an issue, the larger water bottle still takes up more space in my already crowded pack. On the other hand, a smaller water bottle means I'll have to filter more often, but will allow me to to carry less weight and takes up less space. Is there a general rule to this for backpacking? 

One animal with which people may get into trouble when they do not expect it, are the feral Burros & feral Horses found in the Red Rock Canyon area. These animals are very accustomed to people & may approach hoping for food (don't feed them, it is against regulations), so they are generally not a threat, however, I have seen mother Burros react quite defensively when approached & their offspring are nearby. Aside from that, they may be prone to bite or kick if startled. 

A quick google search turned up a reasonable answer. The following looks like good general set of rules, but it may vary depending on where you are, which you didn't say. Source for the following 

In the US southwest, Juniper was commonly used by native peoples. I've heard it said that one can still find living Juniper trees around the southwest that have apparent 'slices' taken out of them where material was removed to shape a bow. Also, a quick google search turned up this site with a seemingly comprehensive list of woods that will work for bow making: $URL$ To lift a few from the list: Apple, Ash, Bay California laurel, Beech , Birches, Cherry, Eastern Redcedar, Elms, Junipers, Koa, Lemonwood, Locust, Maples, Oaks, Etc…
