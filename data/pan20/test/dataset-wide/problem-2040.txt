You are entirely justified. You interviewed for one job and they switched you to another; they should have had a conversation with you prior to your start date if that was going to happen. 

He's right. You did ignore the issue and certainly didn't handle it the way that a number of court systems believe you should. When an employee decides to report discrimination or harassment then you need to take immediate action. Don't push them back to their manager. Instead, immediately get HR involved. If you don't have HR, get another C level and sit down with this person. If the problem is not directly related to the manager then make sure you bring the manager into this impromptu meeting between you, the employee and HR/other management. Hear them out and take copious notes. When it's done, call your lawyer and ask them how to handle it. Don't start talking to anyone the employee has leveled accusations against at this point, seriously, call the lawyer first - they will know what to do. As a matter of fact, if I were you I'd be on the phone with my lawyer as soon as humanly possible to tell them what happened between you and the employee and ask for guidance on how to proceed. At 40 people you are rapidly approaching a company size in which employment lawsuits are more likely to be leveled against you, and these can be incredibly expensive. Some of these will have no basis in fact, others might very well be true, but each has to be handled quickly and correctly or they will escalate beyond the point of repair. 

This part is what worries me. It sounds like a raise is really what this is about. I'm pretty sure I've never seen someone receive a raise within their first 90 days at any place I've worked. You were offered a compensation package just 3 months ago that you accepted. Modifying that so soon is highly unusual - unless it was actually negotiated prior to accepting the offer. Which, although rare, would be the only real reason to gently push your boss to set the date for the review. @JonH has the answer to your stated question. This was just to point out that if you are expecting a raise at this time you might be in for a bit of a shock. The vast majority of raises only occur at the annual mark. Even then it's not entirely automatic as it depends on how the company is doing, how the market is doing in general, how you are currently compensated, etc. To expect otherwise without an agreement in place beforehand is wishful thinking. The main reason I've seen for busy managers to ignore the 90 review is that they feel it's an incredibly low priority due to the fact that there is only 1 outcome: ie: you're doing a good enough job to keep around. If you weren't you would have been replaced during this time. 

Call up your contact at the company. Explain to them that upon reflection you've decided that you'd rather stick to web development and ask how you can go about continuing to interview with them for that position. They'll likely ask why. Be honest and open about it and see where this leads you. BTW, no, I would not consider this unprofessional. As a manager, I'd respect someone coming to me about this before the interview got too far. 

These types of things tend to be fluid in nature. What I mean by that is your team may have a starting point but as time moves on key decisions will be reversed. A very simple example might be a coding convention where the curly braces are on their own lines. Later on, enough team members demand that be changed and poof a new direction is taken. It might even be just time changes like everyone being required to show up at a 7:00AM daily stand up meeting... only to hire someone that drops their kids off at school and can't make it to the office before 8:30... These might seem minor, but each change means that your document has to be updated or it quickly becomes unusable. Looking at your list: Guiding Principles is akin to a short mission statement and shouldn't take more than 3 or 4 sentences. Create a plaque and post it on the wall if you feel the need. Culture / Environment beyond expected work hours is something that people learn through immersion, and is constantly in flux as new hires are integrated into the team. Projects / Code choices should be either readily apparent or quickly justifiable - as in it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to discuss it. If it does, then there is plenty of room for potential change. Further, if you're thinking about creating a 50 page document then you're doing it wrong. Stick to the standards employed by the producer of your tools (MS/Oracle/etc). If you have to say something then you might just ponder Codeless Code case #94. Now, if you are just documenting where things are located, again, that's a one pager.. or better yet, make it a standard welcome email. 

You should request a meeting with both of them at the same time. Let them know that you like your job but there is a problem you need a solution for. Show them a specific instance of code that one likes but the other doesn't. Ask them which "philosophy" you should follow. They'll hash it out and give you an answer. It shouldn't be a problem after that. 

This doesn't matter. Yes, companies use that as a starting point. However, you aren't forced to accept their offer. If you were previously making $10/hour and now want $30/hour - and that's in line with the job market - then you can stand your ground on what you want. It's just a starting point to give them an estimate of what they think you'll be willing to take. 

I hope you understand that the entire purpose of Code Reviews is to point out areas that are good and areas that are bad in order to improve. That's not tattling and in a good, supportive, team building environment it won't lead to people being fired. Unless they just refuse (or can't) improve, at which point firing is a completely acceptable outcome. Point is, there is absolutely nothing wrong with pointing out mistakes. Even in a public way that a code review allows. It's how you deal with those mistakes that can lead to problems. 

If someone is bad enough you want to fire them then I'm at a loss as to why you'd want to keep them around for another 3 or 4 months. Either you need to let this person go now and find a replacement or you need to sit down with them and put an improvement plan in place. Doing anything else shows a lack of leadership ability. Also, imho, when you are firing someone you walk them out the same day that you have that conversation. You can't always tell what people will do when they are presented with such a stressful thing as losing their job. The possibilities range from total sabotage to simply just sitting at their desk doing nothing because there is zero motivation to do a good job at that point. So, if this person is good enough to keep for several more months then there has to be some redeeming qualities you can work with while helping them improve. Bear in mind that guiding people to improve isn't an easy task and will require quite a bit of effort on your part. That said, turning an employee around can be a very satisfying experience for both of you. However if you truly feel that they can't be redeemed then you have to let them go now. Doing anything else is a disservice to your company, your team and even to them as they believe they are working just fine. As a boss I'd see it as a waste of time/money keeping someone around for months after a decision was made - which reflects badly on you. As a team member I'd wonder why you keep incompetent people around while probably asking me to help clean up their mess - which also reflects badly on you. 

This is actually a somewhat complicated question. I'll do what I can to cover at-will employment states. First off, the USA has an adverse reaction to anything that has the appearance of slavery; forced employment certainly falls under this view. A second thing that impacts this is how contract law works in the USA. All contracts, in order to be valid, require "consideration" for both sides otherwise they are unenforceable. Some state supreme courts have ruled that continued employment or the normal employee salary can not be used as consideration; others have taken the opposite opinion. This means that an employer which has a new hire sign a "you will always give 2 weeks notice" document may have to provide some other form of consideration to the employee for that above and beyond the normal salary. For non-critical employees, you'll never see this happen as the benefit to the company simply isn't there. For crucial ones a company will sometimes offer a monetary bonus to the employee to encourage them to stay those 2 weeks or longer. Certainly owners of companies that are being acquired usually sign an agreement to provide continued service to the new owners for a certain period of time at a certain rate in order to facilitate the hand over. However this is quite a bit different than a normal employment contract. Even if an employee signs that document and simply walks out one day leaving the contract unfulfilled then the only recourse the company will have is to not pay that extra bonus. For those states where continued employment is consideration - well, the employee again can still walk away and only to give up those last few weeks of pay - which they were giving up anyway. Point is, the company can't take this any further. No court in the USA is going to force someone to actually show up to work because to do otherwise would give an appearance of slavery. Further no company would want to be involved in the tremendous amount of very bad press that would occur when having workers sign such a clause. At the end of the day, the notice period is just professional courtesy. Yes, it's generally one sided in the employer's favor but it's not required and, in my opinion, not that big a deal to ignore it.
