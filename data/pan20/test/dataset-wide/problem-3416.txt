It is often stated that eurodollar borrowing is clost substitute for Fed funds borrowing. In other words, when US banks cannot fund themselves domestically, they might go to the eurodollar market and borrow some money to satisfy thier reserve requirment. Although it seems intuitive that in eurodollar borrowing you are borrowing from banks in other countries, I believe it implicitly involve a loss of reserve in a US bank. This is because since foreign banks cannot hold reserve at Fed and the borrower wish to borrow reserve, the only way this can happen is for the foreign bank to demand its US correspondant (the US bank where it deposits its dollar) to transfer the amount of reserve to the borrower. So implicitly, it is also the US bank that is lending its reserve. Am I correct? 

So let us agree that the fisher equation is $1 + i = (1 + r)(1 + \pi).$ Is it a definiton or good estimate. Intuition tells me this make so much sense and almost qualify as an equation that must hold. However, sources online tell me that it is a good approximation. If we accept that, can anyone suggest examples when the equation fails and why? Thank you! 

By re-indexing all investment projects in the form of $s_{J,t}$, I get the following two equivalent constraints \begin{align} c_t+y_{t+1}-y_t&\leq f(k_t)-\sum_{i=1}^\infty\varphi_j s_{J,t-(J-j)} % Resource Constraint \\ k_{t+1}&=(1-\delta)k_t+S_{J,t-(J-1)} %Law of motion for capital formation \end{align} Hence, the Lagrangian for the maximization problem is \begin{multline} \mathcal{L} = \sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^tu\left(c_t,1- \alpha_0n_t - \eta(1-\alpha_0) a_t\right) %Objective Function - \sum_{t=0}^\infty\lambda_{1t}\left(c_t+y_{t+1}-y_t+\sum_{i=1}^\infty\varphi_j s_{J,t-(J-j)}-f(k_t)\right) % Resource Constraint \\ - \sum_{t=0}^\infty\lambda_{2t}\left(k_{t+1}-(1-\delta)k_t-S_{J,t-(J-1)}\right) %Law of motion for capital formation - \sum_{t=0}^\infty\lambda_{3t} \left(a_{t+1}-(1-\eta)a_t-n_{t}\right) % Law of motion for past leisure \end{multline} where the state variables at time $t$ are $a_t, k_t, y_t$ and the decision variables at time $t$ are $c_t, n_t, s_{Jt}, y_{t+1}$. It is easy to see that all constraints must bind. The necessary conditions are \begin{align} &\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial c_t} =0\implies \beta^t \frac{\partial u}{\partial c_t}=\lambda_{1t} \\ &\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial s_{J,t}} =0\implies \sum_{i=1}^J\lambda_{1,t+J-i}\varphi_i=\lambda_{2,t+J-1} \\ &\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial k_t}=0\implies \lambda_{1t}\frac{\partial f}{\partial k_t}+\lambda_{2t}(1-\delta)=\lambda_{2,t-1}, \end{align} which holds for all $t$. Combining 14,15,16 and simplifying, we have \begin{equation} \frac{\partial u}{\partial c_t}\frac{\partial f}{\partial k_t} + (1-\delta)\sum_{i=1}^J\beta^{1-i} \frac{\partial u}{\partial c_{t+1-i}}\varphi_i = \beta^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^J\beta^{1-i} \frac{\partial u}{\partial c_{t-i}}\varphi_i \end{equation} In steady state, $\frac{\partial u}{\partial c_t}=\frac{\partial u}{\partial c_{t'}}$, so we have \begin{equation} \frac{\partial f}{\partial k_t} = \sum_{i=0}^{J-1}\beta^{J-i-1} \varphi_{J-i} \left(\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}+\delta\right) \end{equation} One observation is that since in steady state, no borrowing can occur between household and firm, the real interest rate $r=\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}$. We see that $\sum_{i=0}^{J-1}\beta^{J-i-1} \varphi_{J-i} $ is the price of the capital in steady state. 

Engel curve assumes the price is constant, and demand curve assumes income constant. There is only demand function, no engel curve equation or demand equation. 

BoJ just announced its negative interest rate policy in an effort to drag Japanese out of a deflationary mindset and hoping to shift the demand curve to boost the economy. However, my question is, if people don't want to spend, why bother? Consider the following simple model of an ideal economy. Suppose this economy has a maxium output is 100 units of bread. Further suppose it is a one-factor economy, i.e. all output is produced by labor. Suppose everyone in the country is considered a labor and there is a total of 100 units of labor in the economy. Suppose the most comfortable level of consumption of bread by people is a total of 10 units. Then my question is why would the cnetral banks impose policies to force people to demand more of it when they do not want to? It only made sense under the following circumstance: since only 10 units of bread is needed, maybe only 10 units of labor is employed to do all the production and the rest of the people is not employed, which means they do not have any money to buy the bread. In this case, it made sense for government to raise demand so the rest of the people can have a job and earn money, and therefore spend money, which further helps the economy. However, in Japan's case, unemployment rate looks fine, around $3.5\%$ as I checked yesterday, partly because Japanese companies are reluctant in cutting employees. Connecting to the simple model I had beforehand, Japan's case is like having all the 100 units of labor employed to produce 10 units of bread, althought they really only needed 10 units of labor. This implies that all the people are getting what they want. So why is there anything to worry about that the central bank of Japan even start to adopt these agressive monetary policies? 

When I was browsing the internet last night, I read a couple articles on the Global Saving Glut. And many has ascribed it to be a cause of US financial crsis. My question is how so? The articles argue that huge saving from abroad flooded the US with cash and drives down the interest rate and in turn encourage riskier investment. However, we know that the US dollars abroad are payments from the US. In other words, the dollars foreigners lend to the US comes from the US. So even if there is not a saving glut, US will still have the same amount of cash availiable because then US does not have to pay for the current account deficit. So it feels to me that the availiable cash did not change. Any suggestions please? 

Suppose the government increase its spending by $100 million. And suppose we are talking about intermediate level macroeconomic class. Let the marginal propensity to spend be 0.5. Now the total GDP should increase by 100/0.5=200 because the increased spending increases people's income and thus further increase the spending, so on and so forth. But wait, what if the marginal propensity to spend is 0! Then we have an infinite increase in GDP! OR if this sounds just wrong, let us consider where the unspent money get saved in banks. And banks will lend the money out which induce firm to invest more. So the investment will increase people's income, and hence the same effect as before. So in the end, we see that the increase in government spending will increase income by the same amount, and then increase spending again by the same amount (the saving also get invested, so it increases the GDP), and etc. This is clearly not the case in the world we live in. What is the catch? 

What happens to Fed's balance sheet when its asset shrink in value? I noticed that Fed's balance sheet is special because I do not see any O.E. category (correct me if I am wrong). Suppsoe Fed's subprime MBS shrink in vlaue, its asset is decreased, but its liability doesn't (correct me if I am wrong), so it has an inbalance between A and L. If no O.E. is there, how can this be? Also, Prof. Robert Shiller's "The Subprime Solution" says "if losses on collateral [during the crisis] mean that there are not enough funds to cover the defaulted loans, this will be reflected by the Fed paying less to the federal government, hence ultimately higher taxes for individuals." What does Prof. Shiller mean when he says not enough funds to cover the the defaulted loans and what does he mean by funds? What funds exactly? I mean, Fed has the ability to create reserve so how can there be not enough funds? One last question is why is the Fed paying the federal governemnt? I have never heard of Fed needing to pay the governemnt, shouldn't it be the governemnt pay the Fed due to the marturing of the T-bills and etc? 

We already know that Eurodollar never leaves U.S. But then what do the media mean when they say bringing U.S. dollar offshore (eurodollar) onshore? Isn't it always onshore? (Let us omit the real physical cash) Also, the Fed website says that both Eurodollar and Fed funds liability do not have reserve requirement. My question is how can banks in the U.S. hold eurodollar liability? I mean, eurodollar is defined to be U.S. dollar deposited off-shore or IBF. So doesn't that mean U.S. based banks cannot have Eurodollars by definitions? And since eurodollar does not leave the U.S., its borrowing in Eurodollar market in its off-shore branch is actually simply a transfer of Fed reserve from the lender's bank's U.S. bank to the borrower who is a U.S. based bank. Then the liability of the U.S. based borrower shows up as time deposit due to its off-shore branch. So I think this is how banks borrow from Eurodollars market. But the above question remain.

In microeconomics textbook, there is always this notion of zero economic profit in perfect competition. We know that when people gets negative economic profit, they often leave the market. What I wonder is if there exists some NPOs that competes in everyday markets (such as food markets because it sounds like doable), earning say zero accounting profit, meaning negative economic profit. If there do exist, why aren't they driving other for profit competitiors out? Is this because not much people are investing or what? 

Suppose we are in an economy with only two kinds of investment, business investment and residential investment. Suppose also that government gives tax-credit on business investment. Will there be a substitution effect like the one happens in microeconomics where the demand curve for residential investment is shifted downwards and the demand curve for business investment is shifted upwards? I mean, a textbook would say there will be an upward shift for business investment demand curve and no changing in residential investment curve. Any comments will help! 

During the bimetallic era, there was always a dilemma where the mint ratio differs from the market ratio of their metallic value. I state this is impossible. Suppose the mint&market ratio of silver to gold is 15:1 and the market ratio rise to 16:1 because gold gets more desirable or more silver was discovered, or for whatever reason. Note in this case, the mint overvalue the silver. Now, scholars claim people will sell their gold in the market in exchange for silver. My question is why would people sell the gold in exchange for silver if they could get a better rate at the mint? I argue that such difference would not occur in the first place. The reason is that if gold suddenly become more desirable than silver, and the market price is about to rise over the mint ratio, but since we can always exchange silver for gold at the mint at 15:1, the market rate will never exceed mint ratio. Similarly, if silver becomes more desirable, people will go to the mint to get silver once market ratio goes near 15:1. Of course, if the mint was not accessible by everyone, this could surely happen if the difference between two rate was not too big. 

You are right that if the inflation rate is calcualted using PPI, then PPI-adjusted price for copper didn't not change, i.e. the real prie for copper did not change. However, we would also consider the real income and real prices of the necessities in determinging wether copper has increased in value reative to income and daily necessities. Since this time when we compute the real income, we would be using the PPI calculated inflation rate as well. If nomial income rose by $5\%$ by the end of the fifth year while the price of copper along with other PPI goods rose by $15\%$ at that time, we would get a real income that is lower than the real income five years ago, which then would be apparent that the value of copper, or the relative value of copper, has increased. 

In my macroeconomics class, our professor showed an example of the introduction of the credit card. She says that this will decrease the money people are willing to hold, and thus increase the money velocity. But why is that true? I mean, although it seems like the credit card as a new mean of payment makes us feel we are not holding much money, but the credit card company are actually paying for us them using deposits. So the money people hold didn't actually change because while consumers hold less cash or deposit, banks that offer credit card will need to hold more cash or deposit to pay for it. So I think the claim that money velocity increases is false. Am I right? 

How do one know whether an appreciation in the price of an asset is a bubble or not? For example, during the 2007-2008 crisis, there was a housing bubble, which is only mainly agreed upon when the bubble actually starts to burst. Beforehand, however, the rise in housing price was not commonly accepted as a bubble, especially during the period when the housing price was still rising before the crisis. So how do we know whether an appreciation is a bubble or not? Any suggestions of articles about the issue are appreciated. 

Consider CPI and PPI, Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index respectively. Note that many book correct inflation using the above measures. However, I doubt inflation corrected by these values tells the true or whole story. Consider the following case. According to a microecon textbook I am reading, the real price of copper has been stable over the past decades despite the fact that demand soared over these decades. Let us assume that the real price is computed using PPI. If the PPI has increased siginificantly more than CPI in terms of percentage increase comparing to their common base year, then although PPI-corrected real price is stable for copper, it's relative price to basic commodities has soared. In this case, we note that PPI is not useful in assesing whether the real price of copper had risen. Rather, GDP deflator seems to be a better option. Am I correct? Any suggestion is helpful. 

The demand function does not say how much he's willing to pay for an additional amount dq. The demand function says: given the price of good is $p$, you will purchase $Q(p)$ of them. I think your confusion lies in the fact that it is possible to charge different prices for each unit of good. Notice that our theory is assuming one price, not multiple. Moreover, the notion that consumer surplus measure the difference between what you paid and what you are willing to pay is completely false. Suppose the demand function is $Q(p)=-5p+100$. Suppose further that the price is $5$, so you would be purchasing at a quantity $75$. The consumer surplus is: $$CS=\int_0^5Q(p)dp=\int_0^5 -5p+100dp=562.5.$$ If interpreting it as the difference between what you paid and what you are willing to pay, we know that you are willing to pay $562.5+5\times75=937.5$ for $75$ units of them. In other words, you are willing to accept a price $937.5/75=12.5$. However, plugging this number into our demand function, we find that $Q(12.5)=37.5$, i.e. you are only willing to buy 37.5 units of the good, which clearly contradicts to our interpretation of consumer surplus. For a better treatment of consumer surplus, I would recommend you to consult advanced texts on microeconomics theory such as Mas-Colell's or Varian's more advanced book. 

I have seen lots of essays saying that trade deficit means the nation needs foreign funds to finance their imports. In other words, they need to borrow from the foreigners. However, it sounds very unintuitive to me. My concern is that why would do they have to borrow? I always thought financing trade deficit was all about transferring the ownership of financial assets. Of course, if you count the sale of financial assets as borrowing, we are good. 

So I was replicating the results obtained in section 4 of Prescott's original paper, which derives optimality conditions in steady state without shock. I hope to solve the social planner's maximization problem by using the method of Lagrange. An important feature in Prescott's model is that capital is built in multiple periods and each project costs resources, i.e., a fraction of output, in each intermediate period. My question is that how to formulate this constraint into the Lagrangian so I can solve the system of equations of FOC? Here is what I have now: \begin{multline} \mathcal{L}=\sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^tu(c_t,\alpha(L)l_t) -\sum_{t=0}^\infty\lambda_{1t} \left( k_{t+1} - (1-\delta)k_t-s_{1t}\right) -\sum_{t=0}^\infty\lambda_{2t}\left(i_t-\sum_{j=1}^J \varphi_j s_{jt}+y_{t+1}-y_{t}\right) \\ -\sum_{t=0}^\infty\lambda_{3t}\left(c_t+i_t- f(\lambda_t,k_t,n_t,y_t)\right) -\sum_{t=0}^\infty\sum_{j=1}^{J-1}\left[\lambda_{j+3,t}\left(\sum_{t=0}^\infty s_{j,t+1}-s_{j+1,t}\right)\right]\\ \end{multline} where $s_{j,t}$ is the investment project that takes $j$ more periods to complete as of time $t$ and $y_t$ is the stock of inventory at time $t$. For the purpose of this question, let's ignore the lag polynomial $\alpha(L)$ and assume it to be have effect on $l_t$. Note that $l_t$ is leisure and $1-l_t=n_t$ is labor input where time is normalized to 1. In addition, output goes to inventory, consumption, and capital projects. I have tried to use the following substitutions: \begin{align} k_{t+1} &= (1-\delta)k_t + s_{J,t-(J-1)}\\ i_t&=\left(\sum_{j=1}^J \varphi_j s_{J,t-(J-j)}\right)+y_{t+1}-y_{t} \end{align} which allows me to get rid to the last term in $\mathcal{L}$. However, I still do not seem to be making any progress. It will be great if you can give me suggestions on formulation of my lagrangian and what FOCs will give me the steady state consumption, capital stock. EDIT: I tried many online lecture notes, but none of them seem to want to deal with Prescott's time to build formulation and alike...
