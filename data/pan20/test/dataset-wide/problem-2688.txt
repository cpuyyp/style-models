(from the Catechism of the Catholic Church) Now, we must find a thought with a morally good object, end, and circumstance (which here means something that is a superset of typical usages for 'consequence'). Any such thought will suffice, because our definition of 'immoral' requires only that an action be "deemed improper by the modi operandi of a given society" and societies are quite capable of deeming anything improper. Most readers, I think, will agree at least one of the following suffices: 

This comic by Corey Mohler does a good job of addressing this question. In short, because said people find a sort of short-sighted "New Atheism" convenient for maintaining the marginalization of women and other oppressed groups and preventing social change in general. While this position may seem quite harsh, it is well supported in the case of Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, as the lengthy explanation following the comic shows. Most of that explanation (the parts relevant to the discussion at hand) are reproduced below: 

Therefore the Tyranis(Dictatorship) is generally seperated from Democracy based on the Amount of citizens having a say and possibly the Form (depends on your understanding of Democracy). The Dictator focuses on his Egoistic Goals enriching himself on the cost of the citizens. The understanding of Democracy varies depending on who you read. While Aristotle sees Polity as the legitimit form and Democracy(random selection of officials common in ancient athens see: Demarchy) as the illegitimit form. Polity is understood in this context as Constitutational Parlamentary Governement decided by enlightend citizens. This section is mainly to show the broadness of the Terminology. I support more the distinguishing with the Terms of Polybios to address the modern situation. Where Democracy is a positiv Term. In opposition to democracy you have Ochlocracy or "mob-rule" as the negative form of "All". We arrive at grave Problems when looking at communism, since A) communism is again a very broad often used and missused term and B) establishing the Form of Communism. I want to focus first on B) here. Polybios describes a Anacyclosis(cyclical theory of constitutions/political evolution). Since communism sees it self as "freeing of the cycles of the past" it is debatable if the forms used to describe historical cyclical occuring patterns can be used for communism at all. Or in other words if forms of state organisation can be used to describe something thats not a state. (Now comes the rather personal understanding of me part.) However if we view forms as relational structures between a group of people the application is justified. To simplify matters in this regard it seems to be the easiest to conceptualize communism as special form of anarchism. The relations between the people are power relations. Power has the characteristic of not being distributed equally in any given time. Furthermore power can be subdivided into authority(accepting someone freely) and violence(usage of physical intimidation to generate acceptance). State forms organize the power distribution in a certain way using usually authority and violence but to different degrees. Anarchism/Anarchistic states(f.e. revolution or civil wars) (often) do not organize or organize to a lesser degree. Leading to a more "law of the jungle/mob-like" power structure that is prone to demagoges (Robespierre/Hitler/Lenin/Mao/Pol-Pot/Kim Il-sung/Mussolini ect.). Making it's form the bad "All" form, where basically anyone can rise to power, where traits needed are bruttality and deception to hold your position. Polybios describes in his Anacyclosis that 1 monarchy becomes(->) 2 Kingship -> 3 tyranny -> 4 aristocracy -> 5 oligarchy -> 6 democracy -> 7 ochlocracy ->1. I however think the 7 -> 1 part is questionable. It seems to be the case that out of 7, 3 arises aswell/or at least rather quick. Since you need violence to cement your position. (See Party Purges under lenin 1921, aswell as founding f.e. the cheka) We can therefore conclude that communism understood as anarchistic is a very unstable state of powerrelations that tends to lead to tyrany and violence seemingly following the Anacyclosis more or less. However to have a bit a clearer understanding of communism we should look at it a bit more closley (A). Communism is an Idealism, based on an idealized view of reality(humans are per definition good, power can be evenly distributed, ect.) and fundamentally fails at this part. Positive intention does not implie positive outcome. The supporters of this totalitarian ideology fail to see the necessary leading to totalitarianism due to the idealized nature of communism. Because the supporters imply that the positive intention is sufficient. The idealization itself makes communism force people to being something their not, demanding a control and forcing structure (communistic parties) that guarantees that they stay something they are not. This structure accumulates power and as history shows missuses this power(f.e. killing mentally retarded people for "not being equal enough"). Consider that communism is not based on the usage of violence(violence is only used to transition to communism), since violence seems to imply an illegitimate state like powerstructure. It rather is based on authority of certain ideas that should be morally ensured. However we know that based on variations of Individuals in morality of Populations that there exist extreme cases of moral frameworks despite the moral dominant frameworks not supporting it at all (f.e. serial killers, pedophiles ect.). If the state doesn't exist as a framework of violent power negating/punishing this acts of violence by individuals, theres either no structure to prevent murder, or it is based on initiative of self proclaimed protectors, that themself have a specific moral framework which themself justifiy their violence and accumlate power. However unlike democracy that limits the competence of the people with justification to use violence, this is not the case for the "communist case" where it's unrestricted and mob-like vengeance actions like killing the pedophile/serial-killer can take place. Which itself leads to overextensiv use of force generally leading to a tyranny of "one" or "some" powerfull people. The acummulation of power does never end since the idealized state is never realised, therefore one can always justify new restrictions torwards possible opponents by drawing the lines closer and closer to ones personal view. So a communist state is an utopia that can not be reached. It also seems to attract people who see themself as godlike figures that could, if only given the chance, create a real communist utopia and cure the world. Overestimating themself by idealizing themself, this is not only arrogant but also false. There are plenty of countries that have become communist states, they all are expieriencing simular outcome despite vastly different cultural backgrounds. If the result is always the same thats what communism looks like. Just because it's not how you expected the process to turn out doesn't negate the fact that it is what happens when you implement communism. The result is that it is a failure with tens of Millions of Dead people in just one century, everytime leading to totalitarian dictatorship and godlike person cult. Breading on the positive intentions of the naivie dreamers to create a fall of the current structure to allow powerhungry maniacs, that don't want to obey conventional moral/cultural laws, to rise to the top, and rather use violence to achieve their goal namley being in power. Making Democracy a just and legitimate system, while communism is a demagogic illegitimate system that leads to unnecessary harm and death. I personally hope this ideology is dead for good. 

Of course It's not so bleak, though. So, you and the people you are speaking with here seem to be defining 'faith in something' equivalently to the belief that there exists intrinsic value; that is, to have faith in something here seems to mean that one acknowledges the intrinsic value present in that thing. Deific adoration, then, presupposes faith, since it is necessary to acknowledge God's intrinsic value to worship Him. Moreover, though, faith 'in something else', if it is to be differentiated from the ordinary faith of expectation, is most reasonably understood as a holding of that 'something else' in the place of God (c.f. idolatry). Since to take something as God requires the attribution of the intrinsic value due God, this, too, seems to map well. Given that that is the definition we are dealing with, it should be no surprise that faith is necessary to avoid perceived meaninglessness; indeed faith is definitionally that which is necessary for meaningfulness! So, the statements made by these speakers are true, but vacuously so. They don't really reflect on the nature of Man's relationship to God nor Man's need for that relationship, and neither do they say anything which legitimately concerns mass shootings, depression, or the other Scary Social Things that they mention. They merely say "If you believe that anything has intrinsic value, then you don't believe that there is nothing of intrinsic value", and also "If you believe that there is nothing of intrinsic value, then you don't believe there is anything with intrinsic value", both of which are obviously true. The problem is that the speakers are trying to imply things that may or may not be true via other meanings and implications attached to the specific words employed. Essentially, those points which are argued by implication ('suicidal acts of violence are the result of not having enough faith', for example) are argued only via equivocation. 

Since the ordering them, guided by the rulebook, creates a structure that contains meaning for the reciever. The key point seems rather to be an unawareness/unintrestedness of/in the structure by the person in the room. This creates the clear cut between syntax and semantics. This clear cut also is caused by the rulebook containing 2 languages, which are superimposed by someone who isn't the person in the room that just understands one and shuffles expressions of the other language around. This unintrestedness poses the question, that given the temporal structure of the sensory input, does the person in the CRA have the desire to derive the semantic property? Seemingly not he just does his work. Note that the part where you discuss software you seem to distance yourself from what Searle seems to mean since you are arguing about the structures used in the rulebook to transmit the desired semantic properties. Not the CRA itself. To me it seems as if the CRA would mainly focus on the analogy of a single CPU core. So demanding an intresed for the mechanism flipping bits seems problematic. Due to the mentioned above intuition pump your approach seems appropriate but inappropriate aswell. Appropriate since you restructure the intial CRA to make it give better intuitions for possibly more complex computers. However the intial CRA still holds for sympler systems like normal calculators. Others have chosen simular approaches f.e. trying to identify the overall system as relevant, laying more importance on the structure of the rulebook(software). I myself tryed this by reformulating the CRA to appear more like a nervcell and adding it with other modiefied CRA's together to get a 3D brain like structure. My conclusion is that the CRA illustrates the wrong level of analysis for complex systems. Therefore I view your approach as inappropriat since the choosing the CRA as model seems unnecessary to general questions you seem to express. Like how does a semantic in a system arise. Or what exactly is semantics, how does complexity affect semantics ect. 

In the 17th discussion of The Incoherence of the Philosophers, Al-Ghazali attempts to explain how a certain view of causality (which we can see is quite certainly intended to be that espoused by Avicenna) fails to meet his four requirements for an acceptable understanding of causality. However, both Avicenna and al-Ghazâlî seem, at least to me, to argue for different strengths of Occasionalism, and it is not at all clear that Avicenna's view fails to meet the four requirements put forth, at least to me. I don't really understand al-Ghazâlî's explanation as to why this view is rejected, can someone explain how the position is incompatible in a simpler manner? 

In order for a thing to be potentially 'unethical' (here defined as a thing which ought to be done in a given circumstance), we only need to show that it ought to be done in even a single circumstance. That is, if we can show even a single example where thinking something contrary to societal norms (as we have thusly defined immoral) is good, given the context, then we have shown that thoughts can be potentially 'unethical'(again, remembering that this is here defined in a manner more akin to how 'ethical' is usually defined). We have not, for the purposes of this question, defined moral goodness, so for the purposes of this answer I will be using the following definition1: 

It is clear from Rand's writing and recorded talks (as well as bibliographic works about her) that she was influenced by Nietzsche in her youth, and had a detailed knowledge of his philosophy and works. However, it is incorrect to regard her philosophy as a blending of his work with individualist philosophy. Though Rand was clearly influenced by Nietzsche in certain respects, her philosophy is contrary to his on all major points in metaphysics, epistemology and ethics. Rand addressed the differences between her own philosophy of Objectivism, and the philosophy of Nietzsche, in detail in a recorded talk in 1967 at Columbia University. She speaks in detail on Nietzsche's views in these fields, and the divergence of his views from her own. Like Nietzsche (and perhaps partly due to his influence), Rand rejected the moral philosophy of altruism as evil. She uses similar terminology to Nietzsche here, referring to it as the "philosophy of death" and explaining her rejection of altruism in a way that is reminiscent of the way Nietzsche wrote about it. (In her talk in the link she makes the point that Nietzsche has some very wise quotes on these matters, and so it appears that she has been influenced by him at least stylistically, in the manner in which she portrays altruism as evil.) Although Rand agrees with Nietzsche that this is a false and evil moral philosophy, and she adopts certain stylistic similarities to him, they disagree profoundly on what the correct moral philosophy is. Nietzsche regards it as good for man to evolve into the "overman" by pursuing the will to power, whereas Rand argues that man should pursue rational egoism, under which man does not sacrifice himself to others or others to himself (for a more details comparison, see e.g., Hicks 2000). 

Mu In short, asking about religion in the context of philosophy without defining your terms does not a good discussion make. 'Dogma' requires definition, for us to tell if atheism has that/is that or not. 'Religion' would probably benefit from definition, given that you ask "Is atheism supposed to be only anti-religious". 'Atheism' most certainly would benefit from definition. Depending on the definitions you propose, the answer can be quite different. In many cases, atheism has dogma, meaning that it is a perspective or system of belief (and, obviously, has foundational tenets in these cases). In other cases, atheism is a dogma prescribed as foundational for certain systems of belief/perspectives on the world. In other cases, atheism is neither a system of belief nor a belief and thus neither has nor can be dogma. In yet further cases, dogma isn't necessarily entailed by a system of belief, so atheism can be a special unicorn system with no dogma. In still other cases, things are defined unconventionally and anything can happen. 

I think the necessity of practicallity overcomes nihilism rather well. If you leave a general skepticism aside, you are a being in time, in the world. The passing of time itself creates a necessity to decide upon actions that lead to different possible worlds. The not doing anything is itself one possible option of infinitly many. Therefore deciding to do anything or nothing automatically asserts value to said specific action, giving it more meaning then the other options. Even a picking an action randomly would give value to deciding to assert more meaning to the random choosing over the calculated observation based on outcome. Some meaning assertions are better for biological systems. Asserting more meaning to eating then not eating or mating over not mating create a survivable system while the other ones don't. One can hypothetically imagine a system where meaning is not given but this system is free of an observer and options. Observing something and therefore being a subject itself presupposes meaning for such an entity to arise. This presupposition is given in the human on multiple layers like, wanting to eat, go to the toillet, ect. on a regular basis, having a heartbeat or brainactivity, observing the world and structuring it based on certain principles, using language to transmitt meaning and so on. So existing as human is itself a meaningfull structure which is needed for nihilsm to exist. The actions choosen and the perceptions one has therefore negate nihilism. Nihilism is analog to the sentence "This sentence doesn't exist." negating required presuppositions and therefore failing. To me nihilsm seems to make a mistake in it's conclusion that can be best described with this analogy: Theres no natural number with the highest value(ultimate meaning), therefore the numbers have no value(theres no meaning) or are relativly small (relativly meaningless) in comparison. I think a lot of people make this mistake when searching for the meaning of their life. However in the personal case you describe the specific practical options have different values that can be compared. Rather then being sad about not getting the ultimate meaning you should be happy about you choosing the highest possible option and how big it's value is compared to the other realistic options you had. Note: I am aware that there are multiple notions of nihilism. I didn't exactly know which you ment so I addressed a general notion. 

It is important not to conflate metaphysics with epistemology. Your question asks for the "criteria of existence" and seeks a set of criteria for determining when something exists. However, you then posit a set of operational criteria not for existence itself, but for obtaining knowledge of an existent. That is an epistemological ---not a metaphysical--- issue. As a metaphysical issue, there can be no "criteria" for existence since it is not up to us to decide what rules reality must conform to in order to exist. Existence merely exists, and is whatever it is --- it obeys whatever principles are in its nature to obey and it is for us to discover its nature. (One might cleverly argue that the fundamental nature of existence forms the "criteria" of existence, but that would be putting the matter backwards.) In regard to what particular schools of philosophy say about the nature of existence, that is virtually the entire subject of metaphysics (or at least the main starting issue in this field). There are many ideas that have been put forward by different philosophers (and schools of philosophy) throughout history, and it would be difficult to summarise this discussion in a short post, since that would mean recounting the history of the subject of metaphysics. While I won't attempt to do that, perhaps I can nonetheless give you a taste of it by considering a couple of common issues and positions. Is existence a property? To start with, there has been historical debate within metaphysics as to whether "existence" is a property of a thing or a precondition of a thing. Plato believed that the "forms" for various things existed apart from actual objects. Similarly, some of the medieval philosophers (e.g., Aquinas) held that there was a distinction between existence of a thing and its "essence", and they held that a thing could have essence but not existence. Hence, they regarded "existence" as a property of a thing (e.g., a horse has this property but a dragon does not). Other philosophers (e.g., Hume and Kant) regarded this as an illusory distinction, and regarded existence as not being a property, but a precondition for having properties. The noumenal and phenomenal worlds: Once you transition from metaphysics to epistemology, you will encounter Kant's famous arguments about the relation of existence to perception. Kant believed that existence was split ---epistemologically speaking--- between what we perceive with the senses (the phenoumenal world) and things as they are "in-themselves" (the noumenal world, unmediated by the senses). He regarded the noumenal world as the "real world", and denied that we can have knowledge of this through the senses. ("I have therefore found it necessary to deny knowledge, in order to make room for faith.") Is existence all in the mind (idealism)? Berkeley made a similar argument to Kant, but used it as the basis for the idealist claim that existence is merely a mental construct. Berkeley argued that the mind "cannot conceive of bodies existing unthought of", and therefore its only apprehension was of a special kind of existent that exists only in the mind. (The philosopher David Stove famously called this form of argument "the worst argument in the world".) As you can see, there are some arguments about existence which use the duality of what can and can't be perceived to ground a theory of the limits of human knowledge of reality (e.g., Kant's phenomenal world). Arguably the idealist position attempts to elevate this to a claim about the criteria for existence itself, but even here it is usually frames as existence "to the mind". 

Your question is somehow very unspecific. Generally there are three forms of Amount of Rulers: One, Some, All citizens and the differentiating them by Alltruistic(good) and Egoistic(bad) introduced by Aristotle. This creates a table of the Form: Alltruistic | Egoistic 

I am aware that this response is slightly off topic, however I hope it still helps. I think viewing Searls Chines room as "Intuition Pump", a concept introduced by Daniel Denett, is a usefull approach. Where thought experiments are entities that give us better or worse intuition of a certain phenomena. By slightly changing parts of the thought experiment in question one sees if, it is a good intuition pump or not. By analyzing if the changed thought experiment sustains the same intuition. My conclusion is that the CRA is dependending strongly on it's intial form to create the demanded intuition. Meaning adding new entities like you suggest f.e. "strings" shows the limitied validity of the CRA for the analog phenomena it tries to describe. I disagree with your statement that there are: 

Most of science is a matter of testing the nature of external things to establish their properties and test causal relationships. That kind of work presupposes confidence in some stability of the nature of things and the causality of action, and it presupposes the validity of sense data and its ability to establish objective knowledge. Hence, philosophically speaking, I would say that the groundwork for science is the philosophical conclusion (not really an assumption so much as acceptance of certain philosophical arguments) that existence exists (i.e., the world external to the mind is real), that things in existence have a nature and follow causality, that the senses are valid and are able to objectively establish the nature of things (through various processes like the scientific process), and that objective knowledge is possible. Now, all of that involves a lot of philosophical conclusions. Many working scientists take those things for granted and do not explore these philosophical issues, but those who are interested study the philosophy of science and study metaphysics and epistemology more broadly in order to form conclusions on these kinds of issues. No doubt there are scientists that disagree with the above positions, and interpret their scientific knowledge differently (e.g., as subjective knowledge, or as knowledge of mere "phenomena", etc.), but I suspect that the majority of scientists hold an implicitly objectivist realist philosophical stance.
