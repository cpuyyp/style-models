Yes, it's a simple application of ultraproducts. Suppose that for fixed $d$, every finitely generated subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ has a faithful representation $j_H$ in $G_H=\text{GL}_d(K_H)$ for some field $K_H$. Then $G$ has a faithful representation into $\text{GL}(K)$, where $K$ is an ultraproduct of the $K_H$. Argue as follows: consider the lattice $I$ of all finitely generated subgroup. Consider an ultrafilter $\omega$ on $I$ containing, for every f.g. subgroup $H$, the set of subgroups containing $H$. Then map $G$ into the ultraproduct $\ast^\omega(G_H)$ as follows: first extend $j_H$ to $G$ by defining $j_H(g)$ to be equal to 1 if $g\notin H$ (note that $j_H$ is a homomorphism only in restriction to $H$). Map $G$ into the product $\prod_H G_H$ by mapping $g$ to $(j_H(g))_H$. This is certainly not a homomorphism, but the composite map into the ultraproduct $\ast^\omega(G_H)$ is an injective homomorphism. Now the ultraproduct $\ast^\omega(G_H)$ is canonically isomorphic to the group $\text{GL}_d(\ast^\omega K_H)$. Finally this applies to free groups, but to many other groups, e.g. locally free groups and subgroups of ultraproducts of free groups, aka locally fully residually free groups. Note that if your group $G$ has a certain infinite cardinality, you can end up with a field of the same cardinality by restricting to the field generated by matrix entries of the image of your representation. 

The answer is no: it's not simple. It's an easy adaptation of the remarks done in Button's paper. The background: (a) Minasyan-Osin: let $G$ be an amalgam $G=A\ast_C B$ of two groups over a proper subgroup $C$, such that $C$ is weakly malnormal in $B$. Then $A\ast_C B$ is acylindrically hyperbolic. [In case of index (2,2), there's a homomorphism onto the infinite dihedral group.] (b) (Osin) Every finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group is SQ-universal (and hence has continuum many normal subgroups). Given this it is not hard to conclude. Consider an amalgam $A\ast_C B$ with $C$ virtually cyclic. It remains to consider the case when $C$ is weakly malnormal in neither $A$ nor $B$. Since $C$ is infinite virtually cyclic, it follows that it is a commensurated subgroup, in the sense that it is commensurate to all its conjugates, in both $A$ and $B$ (two subgroups of a group are commensurate if their intersection has finite index in both). Given a group $H$, its abstract commensurator $\mathrm{Comm}(H)$ is the set of isomorphisms $f$ between two finite index subgroups $H_1$, $H_2$, modulo coincidence on a smaller finite index subgroup. If $L$ has finite index in $H$, then the inclusion $L\to H$ induces an isomorphism $\mathrm{Comm}(L)\simeq\mathrm{Comm}(H)$. Hence for every amalgam $A\ast_C B$ such that $C$ is commensurated in both $A$ and $B$, we have a homomorphism $A\ast_C B\to\mathrm{Comm}(C)$. Here, $C$ being virtually (infinite cyclic), we have $\mathrm{Comm}(C)\simeq\mathbf{Q}^*$. Hence assuming the amalgam has a finite abelianization, this homomorphism is trivial, which means that deep enough cyclic subgroup $N$ of finite index in $C$ are normal in both $A$ and $B$. Hence $G$ is not simple, and even better, admits the quotient $(A/N)\ast_{C/N}(B/N)$. In particular, unless $C$ has index 2 in both $A$ and $B$, $G$ is SQ-universal. (If the index is twice 2, we deduce that $G$ is virtually $\mathbf{Z}^2$.) [Actually the latter conclusion (SQ-university except in index 2-2 case) holds if both homomorphisms $A\to\mathrm{Comm}(C)\leftarrow B$ have a finite image. If both have a nontrivial image and at least one has an infinite image, then since both vanish on $C$, we get a free product quotient and get SQ-universality. It remains the case where one has infinite image and the the other is trivial. In this case Button gets SQ-universality with a more complicated argument in the case $C$ is cyclic. I haven't tried to see if it adapts to $C$ virtually cyclic, but in all cases this is not asked by the OP.] 

Yes. Fix $i$. For $n\ge i$, let $L_n$ be a $p$-Sylow of $S_n$ containing $P_n$. Note that $S_i$ is subnormal in $S_n$. By the lemma below, $L_n$, the intersection $M_n=L_n\cap S_i$ is a $p$-Sylow of $S_i$. Now there exists an infinite set $N$ of $n$ such that the Sylow $M=M_n$ does not depend on $n\in N$. Since $\langle P_n,M\rangle$ is a $p$-group for all $n$ and $P=\bigcup P_n$, we deduce that $\langle P,M\rangle=\bigcup\langle P_n,M\rangle$ (increasing union) is a $p$-group. By maximality, we deduce that $M\subset P$, QED. [Lemma: if $G$ is a finite group, $H$ a subnormal subgroup and $P$ a $p$-Sylow of $G$ then $P\cap H$ is a $p$-Sylow of $H$. Indeed, by an obvious induction we can reduce to the case when $N$ is normal, let $Q$ be a $p$-Sylow of $H$. Then $Q$ is contained in a $p$-Sylow of $G$, that is, a conjugate $gPg^{-1}$. So $g^{-1}Qg\subset P\cap H$ (because $H$ is normal); by cardinality this is also a $p$-Sylow of $H$ and the lemma is proved.] 

Here's a couple of analogous questions, one in terms of finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras and one in terms of finite $p$-groups; I'd be interested in an answer to either: 1) Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an isomorphism-closed class of finite-dimensional nilpotent complex Lie algebras. Assume $\mathcal{L}$ is closed under taking finite direct products, subgroups, and quotients. Assume that it does not satisfy any common identity (i.e., any free Lie algebra is residually-$\mathcal{L}$). Does $\mathcal{L}$ necessarily consist of all finite-dimensional nilpotent complex Lie algebras? 2) Let $p$ be prime. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an isomorphism-closed class of finite $p$-groups. Assume $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under taking finite direct products, subgroups, and quotients. Assume that it does not satisfy any common identity (i.e., any free group is residually-$\mathcal{C}$, or still equivalently the free group on 2 generators is residually-$\mathcal{C}$). Does $\mathcal{C}$ necessarily consist of all finite $p$-groups? (Note: I ask both questions in the positive but I don't particularly expect a positive answer!) 

Edit (May 2017): I've removed a confusing paragraph I initially wrote, which does not address the intended question anyway. I think I made a confusion between being reduced and residually finite for abelian groups. For abelian groups, clearly residually finite implies reduced. The converse is true for torsion-free abelian groups. But it is easy to find counterexamples among countable torsion abelian $p$-groups. If I could remove the first occurrence of "torsion-free" in (a), it would answer the question. But the quotient of even a residually finite abelian group by its torsion subgroup can fail to be reduced (a classical instance being $\prod_p\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$, or the preimage of a copy of $\mathbf{Q}$ modulo the torsion if we want a countable example). So we cannot naively reduce to the torsion-free case. 

Now consider the analogous problem in a finite abelian group $A$. An endomorphism of a finite abelian group $Q$ is surjective if and only if the induced endomorphism of $Q/pQ$ is surjective for every prime $p$. Noting that $(A/pA\otimes A/pA)=(A\otimes A)/p(A\otimes A))$ and that this "commutes" with defining the operator $b_T$, we thus reduce all the problem to the case when $A$ is a $p$-elementary abelian group, in which case it is solved by the above linear algebra problem (with $K=\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$). To summarize, given an endomorphism $T$ of $A$, the endomorphism of $A\otimes A$ given by $b_T(x\otimes y)=x\otimes y-Ty\otimes x$ is surjective if and only if the three following condition hold, denoting $T_p$ the endomorphism of $T$ induced on $A/pA$: (a') for every prime $p$, 1 is not eigenvalue of $T_p$; (b') for every prime $p$, $-1$ is not double eigenvalue of $T_p$ [that is, $\dim_{\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}}(\mathrm{Ker}(1-T_p))\le 1$]; (c') for every prime $p$, $T_p$ has no pair of distinct inverse eigenvalues (in any extension field of $\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$). These conditions can sometimes be restated: (a') just means that $1-T$ is invertible (which was one of your assumptions). Actually, in the linear setting, given (a), (b)-(c) means that 1 is not an eigenvalue of the endomorphism $T\wedge T$ of the exterior product $V\wedge V$. So probably given (a'), (b')-(c') means that the $1-T\wedge T$ is an invertible endomorphism of $\Lambda^2 A=(A\otimes A)/\langle a\otimes a:a\in A\rangle$. Note that in spite of the latter characterization being shorter, it is much more convenient in practice to reduce modulo $p$. 

Previous solution (in the lines of my initial comment). In $L^2([-1,1])$, define, for $0\le t\le 1/2$, $f(t)=\mathbb{1}_{[-1,2t]}$. It's clearly algebraically free. The closure of its span is $\mathbf{C}\mathbb{1}_{[-1,0]}\oplus L^2([0,1])$ (indeed it contains, for $s<t$, $f(t/2)-f(s/2)=\mathbb{1}_{[s,t]}$, etc). Let $K$ be a Cantor subset in $[0,1]$ of measure $1/2$. There exists an increasing (hence measurable) map $g:[0,1]\to K$ such that for every $t$, the measure of $[0,g(t)]\cap K$ is equal to $t/2$. Define, for $t\in [1/2,1]$, $$f(t)=\mathbb{1}_{[-1,1]}+\mathbb{1}_{[0,g(2t-1)]\cap K}.$$ Then $f$ is continuous on $[0,1]$. Clearly it does not satisfy the span intersection condition at $x=1/2$. What remains is to show that $(f(t))_{0\le t\le 1}$ is free. Consider a nontrivial linear relation: it can be written as $$\sum_{i=1}^na_if(t_i)=\sum_{j=1}^mb_jf(u_j),\quad\text{ with }0\le t_1<\dots<t_n\le 1/2,\; 1/2<u_1<\dots<u_m\le 1,$$ with all $a_i,b_j$ nonzero and $\max(m,n)\ge 1$. Since $(f(t))_{0\le t\le 1/2}$ is free, $m\ge 1$; write the linear dependence assumption as the equality in $L^2([-1,1])$: $$\sum_{i=1}^na_if(t_i)-\sum_{j=1}^{m-1}b_jf(u_j)=b_mf(u_m).$$ The left-hand term is piecewise constant on $[g(u_{m-1}),1]$ (or $[0,1]$ if $m=1$) while the right-hand term is not: if it were, $\mathbb{1}_L$ would be (almost everywhere) equal to a piecewise constant function, where $L=[g(u_{m-1}),1]\cap K$; since $L$ has positive mesure and its support has empty interior, this is not possible. This thus have a contradiction; accordingly $(f(t))_{0\le t\le 1}$ is indeed free. 

the fundamental group is abelian: this is already answered here this MO question, and the fundamental group is finitely generated. This is equivalent (passing to the universal covering of the unit component) to the property that every discrete central subgroup of a connected Lie group is finitely generated, and this is answered here. 

There is a large literature about this, see "non-topologizable groups". These are, by definition, groups for which the only Hausdorff group topology is discrete. There are various examples, the first of which were obtained by Olshanskii and Shelah (see here for references) around 1980. An observation is that for a group $G$, we have the equivalence between: 

Any non-trivial group $G$ has a non-trivial action on a "star" tree $T$ whose vertex set is $G\cup\{\infty\}$ (where $\infty\notin G$) and edges are $\{\infty,g\}$ for $g\in G$. Thus any group admits a faithful action on a tree. Any residually finite countable group has a faithful action on a locally finite tree. If $(H_n)$ is a decreasing sequence of finite index subgroups with trivial intersection with $H_0=G$, this tree is the disjoint union of cosets $G/H_n$, with an edge between $gH_n$ and $gH_{n+1}$ for all $g$ and all $n$; the root is just the point $G/H_0$ and is fixed by the action. This applies to $\text{SL}_d(\mathbf{Z})$; in this precise case the $H_n$ can be chosen so that the index $H_n/H_{n+1}$ is bounded and thus the tree has bounded valency. 

This is not true if $N$ is not assumed f.g. E.g. the wreath product of a nonabelian finite group $H$ by the integers is not residually finite (Gruenberg 1957, can be checked as a exercise). Here $N$ is an infinite direct sum of copies of $H$ (shifted by the action of the integers) and is residually finite. 

A restatement is that for every f.g. subgroup $H\neq G$ of $G$ there exists a normal finite index subgroup $N$ of $G$ such that $HN\neq G$. So this is also equivalent to the condition that every proper finitely generated subgroup of $G$ is contained in a proper finite index subgroup. This appears in the literature as the "engulfing property". Its hereditary version (groups in which every subgroup of finite index has the engulfing property) is considered here (esp. Section 3.2) as "Property LPF". Many examples are described in this link. Your claim that this property "of course implies" residual finiteness (RF) is not correct. Indeed, (same link), f.g. virtually nilpotent-by-polycyclic satisfy the even stronger property PF that every proper subgroup is contained in a proper finite index subgroup. This includes non-RF groups. To answer your first question, the converse also fails. For instance, by Margulis-Soifer + Weisfeiler, the RF group $\mathrm{SL}_k(\mathbf{Z})$ does not have Property LPF for $k\ge 3$ (hence some - possibly all- of its finite index subgroup fails to have the engulfing property). This also answers your second question. As you observe, the engulfing property (and actually LPF) is implied by LERF, as discussed in the above link. The converse indeed fails, for instance the Baumslag-Solitar group $\mathbf{Z}[1/n]\rtimes_n\mathbf{Z}$ is LPF but not LERF for $n\ge 2$. This answers the last part of your first question. 

[Edit:] That $M$ is a torsion-free $\mathbf{Z}Q$-module is a consequence of Magnus' embedding theorem. Assume, as we can, that $G$ is finitely generated free metabelian over generators $x_1,\dots,x_n$. Let $t_1,\dots,t_n,e_1,\dots,e_n$ be complex numbers, such that $(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ is algebraically independent over $\mathbf{Q}$, and $(e_1,\dots,e_n)$ are linearly independent over $\mathbf{Q}(t_1,\dots,t_n)$ (of course this holds if $(t_1,\dots,t_n,e_1,\dots,e_n)$ is algebraically independent). Magnus says that mapping $x_i\mapsto\begin{pmatrix}t_i & e_i\\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$ yields an injective homomorphism from $G$ to $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbf{C})$. Actually, it maps into the subgroup $H$ consisting of elements of the form $\begin{pmatrix}t & v\\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$, where $t$ has the form $\prod t_i^{m_i}$, $(m_1,\dots,m_n)\in\mathbf{Z}^n$, and $v$ belongs to the $\mathbf{Z}[t_1^{\pm 1},\dots,t_n^{\pm 1}]$-submodule generated by $(e_1,\dots,e_n)$. We see $H$ is just a standard wreath product $$\mathbf{Z}^n\wr\mathbf{Z}^n=\mathbf{Z}[t_1^{\pm 1},\dots,t_n^{\pm 1}]^n\rtimes\mathbf{Z}^n=(\mathbf{Z}Q)^n\rtimes Q.$$ In particular, $M$ is isomorphic to a $\mathbf{Z}Q$-submodule of a free $\mathbf{Z}Q$-module of rank $n$, so is torsion-free. 

No. Here's a simple example. In $\ell_2$ with orthonormal basis $(e_n)_{n\ge 1}$ choose $X=\{e_n:n\ge 1\}$ (so $X$ is closed and bounded). Then choose a sequence $v_n$ of vectors with $\|v_n\|\le 1/2$ and define $f_n=e_{3n-2}+e_{3n-1}+v_n$, $Y=\{f_n:n\ge 1\}$. Then $Y$ is also closed (discrete) and bounded, and $d(f_n,e_m)\ge 1/2$ for all $n,m$. Since $\mathrm{Span}(X)$ is dense, the intersection 0 condition does not hold. Then it is enough to find $(v_n)$ such that $X\cup Y$ is linearly independent. We choose $v_n=\sum_{k}u_{n,k}e_{3k}$. This already ensures that $(f_n)$ is linearly independent. Write $P_n=\{k:u_{n,k}\neq 0\}$. We require that $P_n$ is infinite and $P_n\cap P_m=\emptyset$ for all $n\neq m$. Then this ensures that $X\cup Y$ is linearly independent: indeed, write a linear relation as $\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_ie_i=\sum_{i=1}^m\mu_if_i$, with $\mu_m\neq 0$. Then there exists $k\in P_m$ with $k>n$. Projecting orthogonally on $e_k$ then yields $0=\mu_mu_{m,k}$, a contradiction. 

Yes it's true. Indeed, denote it by $\Gamma$. Every injective endomorphism $f$ of $\Gamma$ extends ($*$), at least in restriction to some finite index subgroup $\Lambda$, to an automorphism of $G=\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{R})$; fix a Haar measure for the latter. The automorphism group of the latter is unimodular (since it has the finite index subgroup $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbf{R})$ which has no nontrivial continuous homomorphism to $\mathbf{R}$), and hence maps $\Lambda$ to a subgroup of the same covolume. So $\Lambda$ and $f(\Lambda)$ have the same index in $\Gamma$. This implies that $\Gamma$ and $f(\Gamma)$ also have the same index in $\Gamma$, that is, $f(\Gamma)=\Gamma$. ($*$) is a particular instance of Margulis' superrigidity, but maybe was previously known. Also, maybe there is a more direct approach. 

Every locally compact group of polynomial growth is QI to a simply connected nilpotent Lie group [Losert: On the structure of groups with polynomial growth, Math. Z. 195(1) (1987) 109-117], and probability of return is stable under quasi-isometries [Tessera Large scale Sobolev inequalities on metric measure spaces and applications. Rev. Mat. Iberoam. 24 (2008), no. 3, 825--864:: pdf]. Whence the reduction to simply connected nilpotent Lie groups due to Varopoulos (Varopoulos did not restrict to finitely generated nilpotent groups or nilpotent Lie groups with lattices). In conclusion, for every locally compact group of polynomially bounded growth, the growth is $\simeq n^d$ with $d$ integer and the probability of return is $\simeq n^{-d/2}$. 

Yes. The following answer is inspired by Andy Putman's comment. Let $N_\infty(G)$ be the subgroup generated by elements of infinite order, in a group $G$. Every non-elementary hyperbolic group $G$ with trivial finite radical has a useful property, which bears the ridiculous name "Pnaive", namely that for every finite subset $F$ there exists a $x$ such that the natural homomorphism from $F\ast\mathbf{Z}$ to $G$ mapping $F$ identically to itself and the generator of $\mathbf{Z}$ to $x$, is injective. This is a result of Arzhantseva and Minasyan: G. Arzhantseva, A. Minasyan, Relatively hyperbolic groups are C*-simple. J. Funct. Anal. 243 (2007), no. 1, 345–351. This applies to $F$ equal to an arbitrary singleton $\{y\}$, $y\in G$: then both $x$ and $yx$ have infinite order, hence $y\in N_\infty(G)$. So Pnaive for a group $G$ implies $G=N_\infty(G)$, that is, $G/N_\infty(G)=\{1\}$. Moreover, the property $N_\infty(G)=G$ for nontrivial (!) groups, is also stable under taking extensions with torsion kernel. Hence it is satisfied by all non-elementary hyperbolic groups, since these have a maximal finite normal subgroup and we inherit Pnaive from the nontrivial quotient. For completeness, the elementary cases: if $G$ is finite then $N_\infty(G)=\{1\}$ and the quotient $G/N_\infty(G)$ is $G$ itself. If $G$ is 2-ended, then, denoting by $W(G)$ the finite radical, $G/W(G)$ is infinite cyclic or infinite dihedral according to whether $G$ acts trivially or not on its 2-element boundary, and then the desired quotient $G/N_\infty(G)$ is either trivial, or cyclic of order 2. Thus for an arbitrary hyperbolic group, $G/N_\infty(G)$ is finite. (Note that we use much much less than the full result of Arzhantseva-Minasyan! we only need it for a singleton $\{y\}$, and we need much less than injectivity: only injectivity on the cyclic subgroup $\langle xy\rangle$.)
