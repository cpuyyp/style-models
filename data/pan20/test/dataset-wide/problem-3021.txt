In Mein Kampf, Hitler wrote, "We put an end to the perpetual Germanic march towards the south and west of Europe and turn our eyes towards the lands of the East." The idea of occupying North Africa, perhaps cutting the Suez Canal, and thereby weakening the British Empire originated with the Italians. Hitler really didn't want to use this route. He reluctantly reinforced the Italians with Rommel's Afrika Korps to prevent their (and his) embarrassment after they bungled the job. But his main pre-occupation, was with the Soviet Union, where he felt that Germany could obtain the land and resources need to become a world power. This idea was supported by the so-called "Heartland Theory" of people like Britain's HJ MacKinder and Germany's Karl Haushofer. The theory was that Germany, East Europe, and Russia formed the "heartland" of "world island," (the Eurasian land mass), and whoever dominated the heartland would dominate at least world island, if not the world. Africa did not figure into this equation. 

From what I understand, Germany and the Soviet Union used their air "aces" differently than say, Americans. After surviving 25 missions, an American ace would be pulled out of the skies and sent home to train new pilots, meaning that their scores typically "topped" out in the 35-40 range. On the other hand, the Germans and Soviets kept their aces in action until the end of the war. As a result, Germany's Erich Hartmann tallied 352 kills, and the Soviets' Alexander Pokryshkin scored 59 kills. My understanding is that they could do this was because each flew with large accompanying "protective" screens. That is, they had others protecting them while they fired away against "random" enemy pilots that showed up on their windscreens. In naval terms, it would be as if "battleships" traveled with large protective screens of "destroyers," and their job was to shoot enemy "destroyers" (I'm using ships to describe the pilots' relative ability levels). Were documented instances of opposing aces fighting each other rather than "small fry"? Better yet, were there any instances of an ace setting out to "get" an enemy ace and succeeding? (A land example would be when Soviet sniper Valery Zaitsev supposedly hunted his German counterpart, Erwin Koenig. This story is disputed, but illustrative of my question.) 

Even though Napoleon had "broken camp" at Boulogne before the battle, Trafalgar "made sure" that this camp would stay broken. because the French (and Spanish) suffered such severe losses that the invasion of Britain was impossible for some years. This ensured that French might would be headed east to Austria, Prussia, and ultimately Russia, after 1805; that is, away from Britain. And that Britain would be more or less able to do as she liked in western Europe, e.g. the Peninsular Campaign in Spain. 

During the Civil War, Britain relied heavily on cotton from Egypt and India, which also have a lot of good cotton growing land. After the war, Britain had diversified its sourcing so that it was not as dependent on U.S. cotton. This can be seen in another poster's price chart, which showed cotton prices declining significantly even during the war. The other takeaway from the price chart is that after the civil war, cotton prices returned roughly to prewar levels. So the main effect of "Abolition" on cotton prices was during the war itself (when southern supplies were largely cut off from Europe and prices were an order of magnitude higher), not in the postwar period. 

The 1920s were after the (First World) war. Soldiers were coming home from the front. The majority were "bachelors" but quite a few of them had wives. "Society" needed jobs for these returning soldiers. In some cases, a wife worked because her husband had been killed or incapacited in the war. But if her husband were "able" and working, it was considered "fairer" for the wife to lose her job so that it could be given to another returning soldier. 

There were two major, interrelated events that caused this population boom in the 1970s. The first was the discovery of oil on Alaska's North Slope at Prudhoe Bay and elsewhere in 1968 and 1969. The second was the raising of oil prices by OPEC in 1973 and 1979. Both sets of developments resulted in the rapid growth of oil production in Alaska, and its export through Anchorage. There were two comparable percentage gains in earlier decades, but the 1970s saw the largest growth in absolute numbers. 

The Waffen SS was "considered" an elite force (and treated as such). It may have originally started out as such, and then deteriorated from there. The soldiers in the Waffen SS were "picked troops." As such, they were given the highest priority for equipment and supply. At first, this meant the most fanatical and ferocious graduates of the Hitler Youth Program. Later, as Germany started losing the war, the Waffen SS lost its elite standing because it was staffed with random soldiers, including captured Soviet and other POWs. or worse, former criminals like those who made up e.g. the Dirlewanger Brigade. 

If it is the early 1760s, you have a good reason. That is, the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, which lasted until 1763. Your slave was captured by a French slave trader bound for the French West Indies. This ship, in turn, was captured by a British warship and taken to Britain as a prize of war, along with its "cargo." 

Until the 20th century, the reason was the "one career" nature of Chinese society. That is, the only honorable career was to take the national examinations to qualify as a member of the government. Passing the district examination made one a member of the local hierarchy. Passing the provincial examination got one a provincial slot, and passing the national examination took one to the capital. Would be bankers wasted their youth studying "philosophy" until they flunked the examinations (most did). Imagine a society where all the top (merit) scholars and SAT achievers went to work for the government, stripping the "cream of the crop" from the private sector. With a system like this, the Chinese government went out of its way to destroy, or at least prevent the rise of any alternate source of power. The Chinese fleet was was first immobilized after 1433, then dismantled during the course of the 15th century after the Treasure fleet went outside of East Asia to the Middle East and Africa, according to this source: 

Anthony Wayne is well described as "mad," but that is in "angry (arglich), not "crazy (Wahnsinn). He was a tough, demanding commander who was either loved or hated (more of the former than the latter), who was perfectly capable of the actions you describe. As hard as he was on his soldiers, sometimes executing them in cold blood, he was equally hard on himself. Once, after he was investigated for losing a battle, he demanded a court martial for himself (so could clear his name). 

Furthermore, Ben Bernanke, the outgoing chairman of the Federal Reserve, was a student of the Great Depression, and adopted policies of "quantitative easing" that might have been foolish at some other time, but were peculiarly suited for the "modern 1930s," in contrast to the Fed's tight money policies in the original 1930s. Specifically, the Fed (and the Administration) adopted monetary and fiscal policies that were more akin to those of World War II than to those of the 1930s. Bottom line: the 1929 Crash was associated with the Great Depression and was certainly a contributing factor, but the modern "redo" showed that that was by no means inevitable. Some bad luck and bad economic policy took an inherently tough situation after 1929 and made it into something far worse. 

Cavalry was used only sporadically in World War I. On the Western Front, there were only a handful of divisions used for "special services" such as scouting and transport. $URL$ In the Eastern front, where distances were larger, cavalry was used as "spearheads," e.g. by the Germans at the battle of Tannenburg, and by Russia's General Brusilov. Cavalry was also used in "peripheral" areas such as the invasion of Iraq (then held by the Ottoman Empire). 

There was no specified warning period. And in the case of Japan vs. the United States, there was a "timing" problem. The attack on Pearl Harbor was a "surprise" attack. So not even the Japanese Ambassador was warned in advance when the attack would take place. He received a telegraph message at 1:00 p.m. Washington time, and with some embarrassment, rushed to the office of Secretary of State, Cordell Hull to say that he had just been notified of a state of war between Japan and the U.S. Whereupon, Cordell Hull indicated that he knew; he had just been informed of the attack on Pearl Harbor; that is to say, even before the Japanese Ambassador. 

I would say that the worst economic crisis was the Great Depression of the 1930s because it was global. Individual countries had worse experiences, but these were individual experiences, not worldwide. Other answers discuss the economic specifics in greater detail but here were some of the political results: 1) The rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany. 2) The concurrent "hobbling" of European economies that prevented them from rearming to resist Hitler (Germany followed a "Keynesian" policy whereby re-arming actually "pump-primed" its economy but few people understood that at the time) 3) Other "have not" nations like Italy and Japan "ganged up" with Hitler's Germany against the rest of the world (these were actually rich nations that were "have not" only in comparison to the United States or Great Britain). The reason I say that the 1930s economic crisis was the worst of all time was because it led to World War II. It actually arose out of the seemingly "stable" environment of the 1920s. There is at least one economic writer who believes that we've seen the modern 1920s, and are headed for the modern 1930s. $URL$ 

The person that best fits your description is Prince Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria. Born in 1819, he would have been twelve years old in 1831, which would have made him a "juvenile." That was the year his beloved mother died, which is to say that it was then that he would have taken a serious interest in his studies, particularly "science," as a consolation. The fly in the ointment is that he did not quite get to become "king of England," although a 12-year-old boy who was given a crystal ball and allowed to travel through time might have reasonably confused "Prince Consort" with such. More to the point, Prince Albert made himself a scientist, or at least the British Royal Family's greatest promoter of science. He was responsible for the Great Exhibition (or World's Fair) of 1851, which showcased the then latest scientific marvels. It is noteworthy that Michael Faraday did not give give a Christmas lecture in 1831 (although he did so in 1832). More to the point, he did so four times in the 1840s, and every year of the 1850s, when Albert was the Prince Consort and entitled to hear those lectures. No other person in the British Royal Family in the mid-19th century had nearly the scientific bent of Prince Albert. The one son, Prince Edward was a "people person" who probably took after his mother, while the other, Prince Albert, was fond of music, and served in the navy, with an interest in "applied" but not "pure" science. Much the same could be said for King William IV, except that at age 65 in 1831, he was far from "juvenile." The reference to 1831 in the game was not a "lie," it probably conflated two events, Prince Albert taking an interest in science, and Prince Albert hearing one of Faraday's lectures. For instance, the "Sound of Music" (which was based on a true story) conflated two major events: 1) the 1927 marriage of the Captain and Maria in 1927, and 2) the 1938 Anschluss by making the second appear to happen right after the first. The "seven children" really were aged 5-16 in 1927, but of course all 11 years older in 1938. 

"Witchcraft" and magic were viewed by the Church as religious crimes, (making a pact with the Devil to obtain these powers), and therefore treated harshly. Note, however, that this trend had barely begun by the 14th and 15 centuries (a two century period when this "transition" took place). Prior to the 14th century, there was no such linking of extraordinary powers with the Devil. The Church was primarily concerned about prosecuting "heresy," and did not make a link between heresy and witchcraft until about the 14th and 15th centuries. Instead, magic was earlier considered "superstition," a lesser issue. 

According to one of his letters to his wife Bess, Truman noticed that Stalin liked Chopin's music very much, especially the version played by the American pianist at Potsdam. And Chopin was also one of Truman's favorite composers (alongside German composers that Stalin would not have liked). And Truman wanted "both of them in it" (the war with Japan). Britain was already involved, so Stalin, who had signed a five-year non aggression pact with Japan, was the one that needed convincing. Truman was a competent, though not professional level pianist, so it would make sense that he would play "his" Chopin to cater to Stalin. He had no reason to annoy Churchill, except for the fact that Churchill was (possibly) "annoyed." 

One reason was that a number of these Catholic "secular" kingdoms actually derived a lot of their power from the Church. Two of these were Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain (and some of their descendants) were (in)famous for the Inquisition. They were also known as "their most Catholic majesties." Because Spain had been divided, they derived a lot of their clout from the support of the church, against e.g the Muslim occupiers of Granada. The Holy Roman Emperor was elected by seven magnates, three of whom were Archbishops. Most of the Holy Roman Emperors came from Austria. Because the Holy Roman Empire was actually larger than their "Austrian" holdings, these Austrian Emperors tended to be very loyal to the Church. And even certain members of the Holy Roman Empire relied heavily on the tithes and rents that could be collected through the Church. The French kings remained Catholic because it was important to the French people. In fact, Henry of Navarre (King Henri IV), converted from Protestantsim to Catholicism to win them over: "Paris is worth a mass." Protestantism was the refuge of kings such as those of England, Denmark, and Sweden who wanted to defy the Church. These were the ones for whom the promise of secular power outweighed the prospect of support from the Church. 

U.S. Lend-Lease aid to Britain and the Soviet Union. This replaced the material that was lost to/destroyed by Germany in "surprise attacks" early in the war. This put back the Allied forces on an equal material footing with the Axis. The U.S. fights only Germany's ALLIES; Japan in the Pacific, and maybe Italy in the Mediterranean. Basically, Germany couldn't defeat Britain and the Soviet Union by itself. But it might have won if Japan had conquered China and the Pacific Rim and then stabbed Britain or the Soviet Union in the back (via India and Siberia respectively). American intervention in North Africa (initially directed against the Italians) prevented Germany from overruning Africa, and getting Nigerian oil and Rhodesian chrome. Even if Germany conquers Britain and Russia, the U.S. can "stalemate" her by holding on to South America, Africa and the Pacific Rim (including Japan). Introduce U.S. ground and air forces into Europe. This ensures the defeat of Germany.
