The point you are making wat notoriously emphasised by Kuhn in the structure of scientific revolutions. Here is a linguistic formulation: If the meaning of observations claims depends on the meaning of theoretical terms then theories are incommensurable. We cannot say we are approaching the truth because truth only makes sense inside a theory and theories cannot be compared with their alternatives on neutral grounds. A possible answer is provided by Putnam: There might be a local incommensurability but there remain a continuity in meaning for theoretical terms between different theories. For example the meaning of "acid" does not change radically with modern atomic theories because acid was not referring to symptoms or sets of observations (taste...) but to the hypothetical cause of these symptoms, which is just made more precise with modern theories. The modern definition of acid arguably displays the kind of circularity you are referring to but there is continuity in meaning and neutral grounds for comparing distinct theories which is to be found for example in everyday language. In conclusion it is true that theoretical statements are not strictly speaking verifiable because of this circularity but their global success in contrast with alternative theories gives us reasons to believe in their truth. 

In your question, what you call emergence is simply composition. Sometimes scientists use it as such, but philosophers usually mean irreducibility by emergence. 

In any case physical objects will be a subset of concrete objects (or exactly the same set for physicalists), and again, I think we can say that the electromagnetic field is physical according to both approaches: it is an object of physics, and it is supposed to be objective and compositional (you can consider a part of the field in a specific region). So in all cases it is safe to say that the electromagntic field physically, or concretely exists. Let me end with a remark: it's not clear, having said that, that electrons or the electromagnetic field (or numbers or laws of nature) really exist. The doctrine that says so is called scientific realism (or platonism for abstract objects), but there are also anti-realist doctrines, such as instrumentalism or empiricism. It is thus more appropriate to say that if the electromagnetic field exists, then it exists concretely/physically. But as far as I understood your question wasn't about existence specifically but about distinct modes of existence, so that doesn't change my answer. 

That's a good question and I have no definitive answer, but deduction might not be the good start, since as you observe deduction applies to any domain. Here are some ideas: mathematical objects are purely abstract (they don't exist in space-time. Their representations or symbols do, but the representation is not the object.). They're not perceived through the senses. They are formal. They're based on purely logical axioms and definitions, without any reference to the external world. They have no qualitative aspects. 

Otherwise you have to be skeptic about the possibility of knowledge. Non skeptic answers to the trilemma involve accepting one of these three possibilities, respectively: 

A proposition is an abstract, linguistic entity expressing something about the world and having a truth value, whereas an event is a concrete, occurrent entity in space-time. Without context the question is puzzling: not much relate or opposes the two concepts specifically (no more than fact, statement, object, process...). I had not imagined there could be confusion between the two. Therefore I am in pain of providing references, apart from general introductions to metaphysics, philosophy of language, and the like. 

The second point was addressed by Rex Kerr's answer. Let me address the first one. Note that the plausibility of all the arguments I give is debatable. The point is not that your explanation is strictly impossible, rather that it rests on a number of assumptions that could possibly turn out to be false. About axiom 2: "Every civilization will continue to expand and grow, but resource in the universe is limited." It is not necessary true that every civilization will continue to expand. 

For these reasons, it might be rational in some situations to rely not on pure reasoning, but also on the built-in adaptative system on which your higher-level abilities rest, i.e. your intuitions and emotions. It seems to me that this is particularly true in social situations, because the situations are usually complex, and because "what you ought to do" in life might be an irreducibly social matter in the end. 

To me this is an artefact. Indirect comparisons (between something and "that which ...") often occur with an intentional verb (that which one think, belive, say). It seems then that it marks a contrast between what the speaker thinks and what others think/believe/say. The author conclude that "ne" is used to mark an affective distance between the speaker and "that which"... But I don't think it's true: it's only a grammatical mark of indirection. For the affective aspect, well any utterance can be said to be affective and to involve implicit attitudes of the speaker, be it bare endorsement or not, and perhaps more so when intentional verbs are used and comparisons are made, but I wouldn't say that the "ne" is itself an affective mark. It can be used without any intentional content: "il est plus grand qu'il ne l'Ã©tait" (he is taller than he was). There is an indirection (it's a comparison between a size and the size that he had before) but I don't see any affective distance of the speaker in this sentence. It's a bare endorsement. In other words, this is BS. 

This is indeed a philosophical question and a debated one. First, note that science was called 'natural philosophy' a few centuries ago so one could argue that science is actually part of philosophy, but let's not quibble and take philosophy in the modern sense of the term, which does not encompass pure science. One of the defining characteristic of science is the confrontation of theories to experience. Perhaps a question becomes philosophical enough when it can no more be answered by direct experimental test, but by intuition and a priori analysis instead? Wittgenstein thought the aim of philosophy is to clarify language by mean of conceptual analysis, until our claims become testable. A question would be philosophical when it's not clear what the question is exactly, and scientific when we know precisely what the question means and how to test it (that is, when philosophy has done its job). The idea was adopted later by logical empiricists. This distinction can be extended to Kuhn's thesis: "normal" science would function inside a given paradigm, where concepts and their mapping to experimentation is well defined, but philosophical thinking would be required for paradigm change. Things proved to be more complex than the logical empiricists thought (scientific claims are not always testable), and science and philosophy certainly overlap, but the spirit of this thesis can probably be retained: a question is philosophical enough when it demands us to clarify our concepts rather than simply apply well defined scientific concepts to a specific situation. That puts whole parts of cutting-edge fundamental science into the realm of philosophy, but I don't think this is necessarily a problem. If it is, here is a more restrictive approach: the aim of philosophy would be to unify different sciences together and with what Sellars calls the "manifest image of the world" (our pre-scientific representations and experiences) into a coherent, unified picture of the world. This would be done in particular through an interpretation of scientific concepts and how they relate to common experience (example: relating different notions of time) or other scientific fields (example: causation in biology, physics, ...). There is no consensus on the role and delimitation and there might be other approaches.
