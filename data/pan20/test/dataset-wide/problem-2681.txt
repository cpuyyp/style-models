Example 3 - lifting a 50 ton weight A better illustration may be a situation from the comments - lifting a 50 ton weight. First off, by free will I can choose to ignore it - why do I have to lift it? Second, I can attempt to lift it, or decide that wouldn't be worth the effort. Granted, I could try for an unreasonable amount of time, but who says the will is rational? I could literally kill myself attempting to move it (beat myself to death against it, exhaustion, etc.). I could even sit down and try to use mental power to move it. Are most of these irrational? Based on generally accepted understandings of the universe, yes, and yet, I'm sure we could come up with examples of real people who have done similar things. Some examples can be found in the "Darwin Awards" - google if you are not familiar with these. But the point is not that I will physically succeed in my willed actions, but that I can choose to take a course of action independent of whether the outcome is or appears to be limited by physical constraints Beyond the irrational, I could will myself to move it, and thereby work hard to get the money over my life to buy the land the weight was on, and afford a crane that was capable of moving it. Moving that weight might be my life work, and I may or may not succeed in the end - but the point is I can make a "free will" choice (if one believes the libertarian side) whether to decide to attempt to move it or not, regardless of the physical limitation you say (and we all may agree) exists. 

Could I -as a healtcare specialist- invoke objection of conscience and not attend you if you want to abort? Should your mate also have the right to decide whether your... content (which you refuse to call a person deserving right to live beyond your choice) should be aborted or he/she will take care of it just born? Should the state allow it? Or should the state also guarantee it? Should we consider situations where abortion should be allowed (malformations, your pregnancy existing from a rape, your life is at risk if the abortion is not performed, economical factors, ...). 

(Most of the times they will know nothing about variance and SD, so there's no need to detail those concepts anymore). Although the difference is subtle in language, is not subtle about what do you know about your system. You are changing the propositions and adding another constraint (yes: reducing the entropy). So: Get back to the roots of your problem. Is your system evolving through experiment iterations? If so, you gain knowledge of the system, and you get closer to the overall initial information you know. When you reach that state, your entropy becomes 0 (exactly 0 shannons here): you know what the last ball is. However, if your system does not evolve with iterations, the overall initial propositions still apply: Same experiment, same odds you already know (1 shannon over and over and over and over and damn over until our deaths and beyond or until the coin stops somehow being ideal). 

All of that being said, what about the strong agnostic? I believe he needs to determine what he believes the "most likely" worldview is - or the most likely form of God. Is it the God of the Bible? A Deist God? Etc., and then evaluate the wager based on that. What allows him to choose the "strongest"? Whatever he chooses as evidence. Logic, philosophy, the lives/reasoning of those around him, etc. 

Note that part in the middle about the Vienna Circle that believes talk of God is not even meaningful is called Ignosticism 

Is there an agreed upon definition for Agnosticism from a philosophical perspective? Is there a proper philosophical categorization of it compared to theism/atheim? Looking through the literature I have so far, and questions/answers on this site, there seem to be many different definitions for the various combinations of theism/gnosticism and atheism/agnosticism. In fact, agnosticism itself can be defined as simply the state of being without knowledge (not-knowledge), compared to the the more conclusive position of believing it is not possible to ever have a certain knowledge. I would say the former is just a "weak" form of another belief (theism, atheism or agnosticism), while the latter is a proper understanding of agnosticism as a philosophical term. For example, in Bertrand Russell's description of his belief, he says he would describe to a philosopher that he is an agnostic, but to a man on the street, that he is an atheist. This seems to imply that the agnostic position is a philosophical one based on specific logic that the man on the street may not understand. Given Russell's comments, is the problem of defining agnosticism really due to the fact that these discussions often allow for or include the unphilosophical "man on the street" weak variants that are susceptible to slipping between theism/atheism/agnosticism? On the other hand, some claim that agnosticism is just a subset of atheism. Their argument rests of the definition of the term atheism to be everything that is not theism, rather than the belief that God does not exist - in other words, it can include any belief where one does not positively assert that God exists. I tend to think of agnosticism as a separate philosophical system of belief compared with positive atheism (i.e. I am convinced that God does not exist). That is because I believe an agnostic covers both sides - they do not believe that one can prove God exists, but also do not believe that one can prove God does not exist. Is there a philosophical means of settling this debate, or is this just a matter of term definition? Is there a definition of agnosticism which lends itself more to epistemological formulations? 

This matter about epistemology was resolved many years ago in different ways by both Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn. Karl Popper describes intersubjectivity, meaning that everything you describe is a kind of consensus you establish with the people you are talking with in first place. Homonyms are an example of this: if you're talking regarding police officers and you use the word dick, there is a chance you're talking about a detective rather than about a penis. Aside from the definitions, there is intersubjectivity in the propositions: We all can see the sun rises everyday, and never discuss that fact. But that intersubjectivity is nothing more than our assertion of the reality (this becomes more common when you assert something about people's behaviour depending on what you're used to see). This plays a significant role in fact sciences when we have to describe what elements are in play (forces, masses, energy, ...) and we all agree the existence of such concepts, their meanings, and how do we perceive them. Kuhn goes even further: He describes the crude reality that the way you describe your world may not be intersubjective at all, coining the term of paradigm, which has a set of core values/beliefs as its starting element. It doesn't mean that -forcefully- it won't, but there is a high chance that it might occur. Examples of that: 

I'm not clear on your initial statement (a god which might not be God?), so this is to answer the second part (quotes and comma added): 

A compatibilist would argue that the person is always moving or not moving according to their own motivations in each of your circumstances - but, of course, limited by the constraints of his situation. Given Scenario #6 - a person not moving even though he will drown, because someone threatens his family - this person must obviously value the lives of his family more than his own life, factoring in his belief that the threat is real. If you put 100 people in this situation, some would move and some would not. Some would resist until the water got to a certain level. A compatibilist would claim that all of them were acting in concert with their true composite motivation at every moment that they acted. The person in #1 (restrained from moving by shackles) is also acting based on his motivation at the moment, given the real, physical constraints of his situation. This person might have given up all hope, or he may be struggling wildly to break free of the shackles and escape. Whichever one he or she is doing, it is because of a grand combination of both his or her internal and external inputs, filtered through his internal lens of motivation based on all inputs - physical senses, emotions, internal conscious thought, etc. 

I've seen philosophical arguments descriped as 'argumentum ad lapidem', but never quite understood what the criticism is trying to indicate. As best I can tell, it's a dismissal of an argument with no good justification. Could anybody expand a little on the precise nature of this logical fallacy? 

As you hinted, many of the 'paradoxes' about the idea of God's being omnipotent and omniscient are really just the use of language to describe logical impossibilities. "Can God create a rock so heavy that he himself cannot lift it?" is a nonsensical proposition, like "Can God create dark brightness?" or "Can God kill the unkillable?" There is an answers to such questions - no. However, the 'no' is not a comment on said God's lack of omnipotence, but rather a statement that a logical impossibility is impossible. It would indeed be the case that if a God could 'violate the laws of nature', the laws of nature should simply change to include the fact that they apply except when God violates them. That way, they can easily be defined and be consistent with God's intervention. In this way it is impossible to violate the laws of nature because they are simply a definition of how nature is, whether or not God is causing the behaviour. So, the idea of God is not, I believe, logically impossible. It is certainly possible that a God could exist that is omnipotent and omniscient, and logically impossible statements don't change that. What can be said for sure, though. is that if such a God exists, it is an extremely nasty God (by human standards). It is a God that has the power to end suffering, yet does not. It is a God that has the power to give every human an equal opportunity to discover it, yet it does not; in fact, it gives some humans a one-way ticket to heaven (the ones born into a strong culture of indoctrination into belief in the God), and other humans a one-way ticket to hell (the ones born into a strong culture of indoctrination into beliefs in another God/Gods). Would one even wish to worship such a God even if one knew of its nature? That's for the reader to decide. 

Logically, it is a paradoxical statement. Paradoxical statements do not describe real situations or occurrences. They cannot be evaluated to either true or false because the thing they describe, according to the laws of logic, are not possible. Therefore "always is always wrong" is a nonsensical statement. It is not true, false, not-true, or not-false. It is paradoxical and describes nothing that is comprehensible. If you wish to allow irrationality to exist, of course, then it can exist - we just can make no statement definitive statement about it at all, as it does not conform to the existence/universe that we have knowledge of. 

Edit: the answers so far seem to want to redefine theology or other terms - that is fine, but please be clear that you are redfining them, and provide, if possible, sources for why the term should be different than given (support from historical works, other sites, etc.). 

Example 2 - Falling from a 20 story building Someone falling from a 20 story building, actually has lots of choices for how to spend their time. 

This is just a matter of axiology here, and before saying yes, no, or context, you should understand what do you consider as your core set of values. This is a far from complete set of questions you must ask about yourself or the state you are asking about: 

Finally: why would you care about them? If they accuse you of being immoral because you are atheist, they are not willing to leave a space or gap to try to understand your terms, since they are inherently wrong for not being based on true God's belief (even different christianity schools have a different meaning for that true I said). 

TL;DR: If you remember about Popper's asymmetry between the contrast of your proposition, and the termination upon being proven false, for your given proposition [this procedure is called falsification], you will find by duality that the complementary proposition will be subject to some sort of verification instead. Verification is not falsification but the opposite, so this question can be answered: exactly in the case that your non-falsable statement is verifiable. This is mostly the case of existence questions (e.g. Higgs Boson). Once you verify the Higgs boson exists, you are right. Another example: For atheists, God's existence is a matter of verification rather than falsification: I will not accept that as true until you bring God to me, or bring me to God. Let me explain this: FSM does not exist Is not falsifiable (it is not even well defined) until you define what kind of existence are you talking about. On the other side, "There exists a non-white swan" or "Not (all swans are white)" is falsable. This means that you can pick a method of experimentation (which may not seem practical, although possible). Okay, I will change the sentence. I will say there is a tortoise of the species that can be found on Galapagos Islands (instead of swans) which is black. How could I verify that? Going to Galapagos (and the authorized zoos around the world that breed those species of tortoises) and checking the color. This effort is huge, yet possible. Even if you don't know how to get there, currently available knowledge would let you develop or find the means of performing your observational experiment (I think that, right now, chinese government could ask this question in their country and actually experiment to track all swans' colors!!!). In partcular, this statement you asked for is quite stationary: Take a snapshot right now, and you will answer yes or no for both of them. However, although these two cases are not good examples (since both of them are falsifiable by the same mean, despite the negation taking a huge time), you could find examples when you may say the complementary propositions are not falsifiable. Let's start by stating Popper's asymmetry in this matter. Popper talks about contrast (falsification) in this way: 

Point 2: ".. he will take at least one wrong action" The second point is that Plantinga doesn't require for a free will agent to take the bribe in the given scenario in order for them to be Transworld Depraved (TD). While we know that Curley is TD because he does (and always will) accept that bribe given the same circumstance, but that doesn't mean that all moral agents must also accept this same bribe to be TD. After all, if every moral agent only accepted the bribe, then it would be easy to argue that free will didn't truly exist. But Plantinga doesn't require that every moral agent accept the bribe, given the same circumstances. Plantinga only requires that any given moral agent must take at least one wrong action to be TD (quoted from the end of his example). God could choose to actualize a world without Curley, because God knows that Curley will bring evil into the world by accepting the bribe. He can certainly find a possible world with free moral agents other than Curley who will not accept the bribe. The key, though is that if these other actors fail morally in any other choice, then they also will be TD. To pull this off and create a world with both free will and no evil, he needs to find a world with moral actors that won't choose any wrong action. Plantinga's argument only requires that any given free will moral actor fail on one possible moral choice for them to be TD. So, let's take Mary, who chooses the good and does not accept the bribe. That only shows that it is possible that she is not TD. It does not prove that she is not TD. We must put every other possible situation in front of her, and if she fails morally at one of them, then she has taken (or would take) at least one wrong action, and is TD. Plantinga's argument only requires the possibility that all moral actors are TD. To defeat his argument, it would have to be proven that this is not possible - that there must be a possible world where there are free moral agents will not undertake a single wrong moral action. I actually believe that Plantinga's defense would stand up even if it can just be shown that a single moral actor would always choose wrong; but it is a stronger argument if it remains a possibility that all moral actors must be TD.
