Maybe Cthulu put it off to long. If he just pops up out of the abyss, we will put an armor piercing round between his eyes and be home in time for dinner. Maybe we would catch him in a really big net, then put him in a giant fish tank to amuse our children. Maybe we will slice him up into 20,000 tons of calamari and throw a big party. He still wants to come back and return our puny world to the old ways, but now he needs to make the world ready to accept him. Instead of simply crashing through our cities and sacred places, devouring our souls, he has to offer something for them. Perhaps he sells knowledge of the future and buys people's souls. His long term plan is to create medicines for treating mental illness. After his company has cured Parkinsons, schizophrenia and alzheimers, he will reveal himself as the dark master behind the corporation and ask to peacefully co-exist. For now... 

We've been getting energy from photosynthesis for millennia. We call it farming. Almost every form of energy, from fossil fuels to hydroelectric has, at its source, the Sun. The only methods that don't rely on the sun are geothermal and fission. 

More probable? There's no way to know. We might be the weird ones for waiting until we crawled out of the water to develop sapience. As for using tools? That's a doozy. How would you smelt iron under water, without a fire? So much of our energy manipulation (combustion technology) doesn't work underwater, so its hard to conceptualize a technologically sophisticated species that lived entirely underwater. 

A lower core body temperature. Not all mammals maintain 98 Fahrenheit. For cats, it's 102 (one reason they love warm spots). Most mammals are in the 100-105 range, and most don't live as long as humans. A lower core body temperature would also generally fit with dwarf lore. They live underground, where it's cool - until you get really deep. They aren't as good at long distance running as humans and elves (Gimli) - perhaps because the surface is too hot for them. In the end, all they need is evolutionary pressure to live longer. Maybe Dwarves don't get raised by their parents, but by their grandparents. This frees the younger, healthier Dwarves to work, and the children benefit from the added wisdom of the grandparents. 

If you need to know for a school project, you're not really in the right place. Are earth's plants able to grow on Mercury? f*ck no! using this information: $URL$ Mercury can get as hot as 427F, almost hot enough for paper (and plants) to spontaneously combust. Except there's no Oxygen, so you couldn't have a flame. $URL$ The atmosphere is pretty darned toxic (to terrestrial life). Could life maybe find a way? Sure, why not? But we haven't found any so far. 

Putting inside an atmosphere will cut one of its balls off. Lobbing your bullet out of the atmosphere, it will start to burn up. It will also add some imprecision - as it passes through wind, clouds and turbulence, its course will change. Not a lot, but it's got a long way to go. It could also damage the planet, and certainly the colony. How loud is the boom? It would be really hard to hit things that it can't see in the sky - a ship on the other side of the planet, for example. 

The instinct to dominate is human Out-breeding and conquering other tribes is what humans do. You can't expect other sentient species to have our same motivations. If you are good looking, rich and live for ever, why would you risk fighting with a bunch of savages over a patch of dirt. A human that fights risks maybe 60 years, and hopes to gain wealth, land and women. An elf that fights risks eternity and hopes to gain... what, exactly? Unless their backs are completely against the wall, it does not make sense for them to fight. 

It would probably crumble into mud and rocks. Then you would burn your hand really bad. Oh, and the moon might bump you in the head. 

Christian Monks are Martial Artists When the Vikings raided Lindasfarne Monastery in 793, they were shocked to find that the humble men in burlap sacks and silly hair cuts were more than a match for them. Fighting with heavy bronze staves, they smashed the raiders to pulp. After the fighting, they patched up the raiders, taking care of them while they mended bones. After several months recovering, they sailed back home. "Don't f*ck with those Britons, they are some crazy bastards!" They told their friends. One of their friends said that he heard that his cousin's lord's uncle's brother-in-law found this land further west. It's a much longer sail, but there's no crazy warrior monks waiting to bash your skull in, then patch it up. Britain is, after all, a silly place. Muslim armies liked to fight with champions. Sometimes, they would have a 1v1 and respect the results. When they invaded Spain, the Spaniards sent out their champion. A man with no armor, armed with just a staff. "1v1 me", he said. The Generals picked their champion and sent him out. This funny looking peasant with a staff beat their champion like a rented mule. Could every Spanish peasant fight like that? "Best not to find out, let's go back to Morocco". They agreed. With the war avoided, the Caliphate developed strong ties with Spain through trade. The silk road got on boats in Jerusalem and sailed to Gibraltar. An enterprising Moroccan merchant decided that it was taking too long to get the silk from China. Maybe it would be faster to go the other way around the world. He sets off to find China, but finds America instead. 

Energy Shields As other posters have said, with current technology, big vehicle = big target. If you have to supply power to a heavy, expensive energy shield, You would want to get as much stuff inside the shield as possible. 

Regular, Human Lungs Homo Sapiens are already the world champion long distance runners. We have an extremely efficient respiratory system and only a few other species come close to matching it. Humans at high altitude tend to develop lager lung capacity, so your super soldiers could have lungs larger than normal. My lungs, for example, have 150% the expected volume for a man with my age and height. 

They would recycle the liquid waste, since it is closer to drinkable water than saltwater. Solid waste - that depends on how Atlantis gets its food. If they import it, they can just fluh it outside. The ocean has an almost unlimited capacity to absorb this kind of waste. If they grow their own food, they would use it for fertilizer.
