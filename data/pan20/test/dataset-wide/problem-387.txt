A patron to science In the real world, the feudal system had an emperor/king on the top and nobles that owned land (and the people on it). The nobles paid tribute and aided the king in war. With regard to question 3, an intelligent and scitech-focused race might replace the above system with an emperor who is patron to a court of scientists, engineers and entrepeneurs. Rather than a modern investor relationship, an owner of a research institute has pledged allegiance to the emperor and will direct his research to aid and empower the emperor. In return for this, the scientist has "ownership" of his employees, his field of study, priority in selling goods to the court, etc. Having researchers doing fundamental research under one of the "noble scientists" is not too different from the concept of "standing armies" in Medieval Europe. They must be maintained continuously but only contributes to profit in occasional bursts. Depending on how versed you are in the social life of academia, there are also parallells with feudalism in the loyalty to your field, the adherence to research agendas set by the state emperor and in groups of "mercenaries" for hire. The "patron" concept and Silicon Valley venture capitalism meanwhile also carry some similarities. With regards to the long life expectancy, devout scientists would love nothing more than several lifetimes more of what they're already doing. The unobtainable noble prize becomes a little less unobtainable if you could spend an extra lifetime getting really good at your field. 400 years of being a lab-slave? Bring it on! 

TL;DR: Add methane, remove organonitrogens and other yellow substances. Both Neptune and Uranus get their blue hue from methane in their atmospheres. So you can start out with a moon like Enceladus, which is white but has cryovulcanos and then add methane. Or you start out with Titan, which has cryovulcanos belching methane, and remove the organonitrogen haze. 

The critics provided the proof themselves Before he travels back in time, he uses his machine to send along a "parcel of proof" to some point in time after his own arrival. He can then predict that this parcel will arrive out of thin air at a specified moment. By being an extraordinary event, this boosts his credibility. The clincher however, is that the parcel contains recordings of his stay in the days following the arrival of the parcel. Things which he buried at a secret location and retrieved himself in the future. There could be letters the sceptical inhabitants have sent to themselves, video recordings of people he has met telling how they have finally been convinced that he is a traveller from the future, accounts of the many random things in their lives such as the timing of a sudden onset of rain that ruined their crop, accounts of a kid that fell and broke his leg or of where misplaced items were finally found. Story-wise this gives you an excuse to introduce the supporting characters in more depth. You can, if you like, arrange for a circle of true believers while keeping the world at large indifferent to his claims. For the reader, the point after which he has buried the parcel marks when the outcome of events starts being uncertain again, possibly building tension in the story. Perhaps we'll also see some dramatic scene where the traveller tries to retrieve the package again, to add a warning to himself about trouble occuring. 

A biological take on it is found in [1] which describes a seemingly long-lived alien species. The sentient, humanoid aliens are all adults. Young non-sentient offspring live out in the swamps, but in the middle of the night, one of them might sneak into the village, into the hut of an elderly person, and by force take a large pearl-like ball from the back of the throat of the sleeping person. The swamp-dweller inserts the pearl into its own throat, which grants it the memories and personality of the village elder. The pearl here acts as a biologial memory device. The young one take on the role in society of the elder, while the elder's body, now a non-sentient creature, scurries out into the swamp. The pearl grows slowly larger layer by layer and can last for centuries. [1] the novel "The Accounts of an Old Astronaut" (Jon Bing, 1992) 

Conclusion: You can safely describe a ship which will handle what the sun throws at it. What's really breaking the suspension of disbelief however, is stating that the ship actively keeps itself in a fixed position, for a hundred years. If you instead put it in an orbit, it sounds a lot more natural to the reader. 

The way that the fantasy-webcomic Drowtales approached this, was to make longevity dependent on mana[1,2]. The souls of long-lived races would draw Mana to them and large cities would have high concentrations of Mana, practically stopping the aging process. The connection with nobility and peasants is that the nobles are long-lived because they tend to stay in the cities they rule and because they are proficient in mana arts, similar to how medieval nobles would be expected to be proficient in swordfights etc. If you're a productive member of the city and hang around to serve the empress, you live a longer life than if you work in some far-away mine or are exiled to some remote location. It is therefore in the best interest of the underclass to preserve the status quo and defend the city from being decimated by invaders or depopulated for other reasons. In Drowtales, mana would also be expended in warfare and one could over-exert onself so as to deplete ones mana, aging or dying as a result. [1] $URL$ [2] $URL$ 

It would be fun to have two competing martian calendars based on Phobos and Deimos respectively, but you can also combine them, to unite the warring tribes: 

It's difficult to make space empires work within known physics Travel times would be far longer than experienced by any earth-bound empire. In the days of the Roman empire, you could travel from London to Rome in a month under ideal conditions, no expenses spared [1]. The famous Silk Road trade route took two years for a round-trip from China to Rome and back [2]. Later, a year or two was plenty time for Columbus to discover a new continent. Compare this to an Einstein-compliant round-trip of almost 9 years from Earth to Alpha Centauri and back and 16 years for the Sirius road. The nearest earth-like planets that we know of [3] would have a round-trip time of 20 to 80 years. It would for instance take 40 years to make a round-trip from Earth to Gliese 581 d and back, but it only took 35 years from the day Genghis Khan was proclaimed ruler of the Mongols to the day their horde stood at the gates of Vienna. In modern times, it took 31 years for Earthlings to start and end two world wars (1914-1945). From this you can see that politics and warfare on-planet will be practically independent from a galactic empire Even if we postulate that the travel times are balanced by long lifespans, there's the issue of how the empire will go about its "empire things". There's some evidence that empires emerge as a response to the threath of warfare [4], but how do the emperor protect his flock if it takes a couple decades from an alarm about an attack to when the cavalry arrives on the scene? If we stick closely to known physics, there's also the issue of explaining trade and colonization by emigration. There's some back-of-the-envelope calculations showing that if we struck oil on Mars, there's no way we could run a profit shipping the oil back to earth. Nor do the human race have enough fuel on the planet to lift a sizable portion of its population into orbit, so you can't export populations to settle new land.

Old-fashioned family naming fusing with modern street-naming. In Europe, many family names were tied to either a profession or a place of residence. John Smith was a blacksmith, Benny Hill had a farm on a hill. Today, in many American cities, there is a numbering system for streets that replaces actual street names. For instance, the "3200 block" denoting a block in the Chicago street system or "corner of E 42nd Street and 2nd Avenue" in New York. Now if John Smith sets up shop in 3200 block, he is known to all as "the smith on 3200 block". As profession + precise location is enough to distinguish him, there's no need for "John", which was just causing people to confuse him with the 83 other Johns in that little town. Benny Hill meanwhile, for whom surnames and location is one and the same, changes his surname to 3215, that being his house number. (Note that prior to naming reforms in the 20th century, it was common for farmers that moved onto a new farm to take that farmname as their new surname) So he's Benny 3215, but he is only referred to as "the bachelor on 3215" or "clerk 3215" or even "3215" in his working life and official documents. The city's administration treats the houses as the basic unit of the city and do not tax people, but households. They talk about "the annual income of 3392" and the number of people living there is just a property of household 3392. Benny may still call himself "Benny", but there will be no record of that for posterity. 

Story-wise, I think it's beautiful to imagine the planet's quiet solitude during an ice age. The waves of ice ages and waves of hominins also parallell each other nicely. There's a story in there about a hominin wave which tries to rebel against the natural order by stopping the coming ice age. Or perhaps more elegantly, that the technological development of each hominin wave is in fact behind the ice ages. This makes for a new question, but possible mechanisms include sequestration of carbon in some carbon-based technology (they build houses out of graphene, massiv structures out of artificial diamonds, etc) or shielding of the sun's rays when the civilization starts employing solar panels in space to cover their energy needs. You can also skip evolution completely, by postulating that the cradle of hominins is a small continent or archipelago where fully sentient stone-age people can live indefinitely, but where there are no opportunities for a civilization to arise. With some exceptions, complex human civilizations have evolved in fertile areas along rivers, where large-scale agriculture was possible. As an example, humans arrived in Australia in 40.000-80.000 BC, and while having a rich culture, never developed what we think of as a classical civilization. With the hominids emigrating into space, the ice age wrecks the civilization of whoever choose to stay behind. In the only place left to live, the cradle of their civilization, they revert to a stone-age culture. And then the cycle repeats.
