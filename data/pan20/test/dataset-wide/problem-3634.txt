Sites like bodybuilding.com, Men's Fitness, Muscle & Strength, etc. still use terms such as "endomorph, "ectomorph" and "mesomorph". These so-called "somatotypes" were invented by the psychologist (and possible eugenicist) William Herbert Sheldon, Jr. Sheldon tied each of the bodytypes to certain personality traits, and his research has been discredited time and again as racist hogwash. That being said, if so many of these respected fitness websites make reference to the somatotypes, is it because we've since proven there to be some accuracy to the distinct body types without the connection to personality? Or is this just a case of bad science being hard to wash away. 

3-5 grams of creatine per day (1 of your pills) is generally considered a safe amount. There has been evidence of liver/kidney damage as a result of taking too much Creatine, but seems to only be the case with people who already have kidney/liver problems. Studies have shown that as much as 20 grams of creatine per day is safe. The only real downside is water retention (i.e., bloating). Taking a lot of creatine will cause an average person to gain around 5 lbs in water-weight (which will only go away when you stop taking creatine). Humans typically get half of their Creatine from meat, specifically red meat, so it's definitely more important for vegetarians. You may choose to do an initial "loading phase" where you take 2-3 of those pills per day for 1-2 weeks to build up your initial stores. Then you can maintain your Creatine stores on 1 of those pills per day. On the flipside, you may want to consider doing your maintenance on only half a pill per day. 2 grams is shown to still be effective, while minimizing water retention. A lot of bodybuilders choose to "cycle" their Creatine. They may only use it for a month, and then not use it again for 2 months. They use it professionally as a supplement for beating personal plateaus. But whether you want to cycle it or use it daily is up to you. 

Actually you can't do 2 things at the same time. You have to choose between strength and endurance you can't do both. Best thing you can do is to firstly get rid of the resistance band and start doing strict full ROM pull ups and dips. When you get 12-15 reps at each you can start doing weighted dips and pull ups. That will increase your endurance as well. But not as much and fast as if you were doing specific endurance training P.S You can try adding to your routine some scapula pulls its a great exercise and it's most of the times what is missing from taking your pulls ups to the next level. 

Your daily protein intake is very high and very good already.I don't think you need to add another protein shake as you are right now and probably not in the near future as well. Regarding the problems you mentioned it is a a problems that varies from person to person.I personally don't have any digestion problems no matter how many shakes i take but again this depends on each person.So the only way to find out is to try it yourself and see how your body reacts. In conclusion,you do not need anymore protein intake right now and you probably won't need for another year or so.Just keep working out and results will come.Protein is not everything carbs fats and fiber are also important.As long as you keep a caloric surplus and you eat 120-150 gr of protein everyday you will be seeing great results in the near future. 

In addition to the points made above, HIIT also has the added benefit of EPOC to recover from oxygen deficit during the anaerobic "sprinting" stage. That can increase your metabolic rate up to 13% for up to 48 hours (decreasing over time). The optimal way to lose fat is a good combination of aerobic, anaerobic, and HIIT exercises. HIIT will give you the most bang for your buck and result in a heightened metabolic rate long after your workout. Strength training will have a similar effect, due to the added stress on the body of repairing muscle tissue. The real benefit from strength training is that it helps prevent muscle loss while you're at a calorie deficit. Strength training will also increase your levels of Human Growth Hormone and Insulin Growth Factor. Deficiencies in HGH/IGF have been shown to cause excess fat, and increasing them will help burn fat especially around the abdominal area (belly fat). Like HIIT, cardio/aerobic exercise will burn extra calories and increase your metabolism during the exercise and for a shorter time afterward. HOWEVER the true benefit of cardio is that it increases your metabolic efficiency over time. In other words, the more cardio you do, the more efficient your body becomes at using fat for energy. You could technically lose weight without doing any cardio at all, but it's important for maintaining the calorie deficit and getting the most effect out of your exercise routine over time. Summary: 

As mentioned in the comments the abs are just like any other muscle in our body.Yes,their shape depends on our genetics and there is no way to change that but their size can be changed. To achieve that you just need to train your abs just like any other muscle for hypetrophy because you can also have strong abs but not aesthetically beautiful (ex powerlifters,strongmen etc). Now,assuming you already have both strong and "big" abs all you got to do is lose some fat and let them unveal.This might sound simple but it requires a lot of effort with diet and tracking your macros. 

Working out too hard can overload the hormonal system. You can produce too much cortisol, which elevates inflammation and depletes testosterone. It can take months to recover from real overtraining, but you're probably not overtrained. However, sleep, nutrition and certain supplements can keep you from being overtaxed and prevent burnout. Overtraining Is Rare, But Overtaxing Isn't Could you be overtrained? The demon that swallows gains and destroys motivation? Overtraining is a very rare and misunderstood phenomenon. But you could be overtaxing your body and its key systems. There is a study which showed a significant drop in testosterone, and a nice boost in stress hormone cortisol. Time to exhaustion was also way faster than what it was prior to overtraining. Remember that these problems are not short term, they can last for weeks and weeks if you decide to overtrain. So there you go. Overtraining does exist and the threshold to that is different and it varies from people to people. And if you do find out that you’ve overtrained… Then seriously just take a solid week or two weeks off to begin recovering from overtraining. Let your body rest properly and don’t let that condition go chronic. 

Generally, you want to take in about 20g of protein and some carbs after any workout, particularly resistance-training, sprints, and high-intensity cardio. This is the point at which your muscles are in their greatest state of recovery, and having a high-protein environment is important for that. Some people may choose to take BCAA in lieue of a post-workout meal. As long as you eat some complete protein or take BCAA, it should speed up muscle-recovery. If you take creatine, it's also recommended that this be done immediately after a workout. 

The short answer is yes, it's overestimating your calorie burn. But it's unlikely the sole reason that you're having trouble losing weight. Most exercise machines overestimate calorie burn, and ellipticals are among the worst offenders. Studies have shown that they can overestimate calorie burn by as much as 40%. A more reasonable expectation for someone of your weight might be 100 calories burned per 10 minutes (assuming a moderate pace). Because it's difficult to precisely know how many calories you burn throughout the day (BMR and exercise machines are not 100% accurate), it may be a good idea to give yourself wiggle room when it comes to your calorie intake. These calculations have a lot more room for error at body weights approaching 135kg and higher, especially if you have a high body-fat ratio. Try to aim for a calorie deficit of 1000 instead of 500, and estimate 300 calories burned for 30 minutes on the elliptical. If this is too difficult and/or you lose more than 1kg per week, you can adjust it.
