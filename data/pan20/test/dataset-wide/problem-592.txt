Don't cut corners or your new wheels won't last as long as they could, or worse, they might not last at all. There are entire books written on truing bicycle wheels. Before you attempt to maintain your wheels yourself, without the shop, read those books, buy a good truing stand, and even then, practice on wheels you don't care about. There is an art to it. 

Your tire tube is still subject to the basic laws of physics and logic on this Earth. If air is leaking out of it, then there is a leak somewhere and it is perforated. There is probably something in your tire causing the damage, especially if this continues to happen. It's also possible that the leak was close to the valve, and whenever the valve was up against the rim of your wheel, it was bent just so to allow the leak. 

Riding long distances comfortably has very little to do with whether you're on a 'road' frame or a 'trekking' frame and much more to do with the tires you're using and the seat you're sitting on. Wide, plush tires will go a long ways toward absorbing the bumps in the road, and the seat is your most important point of contact with the bike. For starters, try swapping the seat from one frame to the other, swap out the tires for wider touring tires, and see if your problems don't go away. Edit: and for Pete's sake, make sure the bike fits you. If it doesn't fit you, nothing else really matters. Have a professional fit performed if you need to. 

There are a few different hand signals to use depending on what the situation is. In general, making a fist behind your back or with your elbow out and bent downward signals to other riders that you are planning on making a stop, potentially a very sudden stop for unexpected reasons; When closing in on road hazards, pointing them out is extremely helpful to the riders behind you, who in all likelihood can't see the hazard directly in front of you and could be caught off guard by it. When I see glass (/sharp stuff), I usually relay it to the group by pointing my hand at the ground and wiggling my fingers, indicating something sharp is scattered on the ground. $URL$ $URL$ 

If you just bought it, the shop mechanic should remedy the problem no matter what specific part is to blame. If not, threaten to return the entire bike and take your business elsewhere. It should be as simple as that. 

1 and 1/8" is referring to the diameter steerer tube that the stem is designed to fit. 1-1/8" is roughly 28.5 mm, very close to the steerer tube you measured, that seems to check out, though try obtaining a steerer tube measurement in inches. 25.4, 26, 31.8 are your options for handlebar diameter, so hopefully you can match a set of handlebars you like to the stem, 31.8 is a very common handlebar clamp diameter. 

The 11-25 will work fine with the SRAM components, the bigger question is whether your derailleur will handle the change in cassette range. Head to your local shop for specifics. It probably will, but that's the part you should go about verifying. 

Yes, you should absolutely be taking the lane, provided the car behind you will have time to slow down when you move to take the lane. Passing too close, passing on a blind corner, passing that endangers others and yourself, these are all equally dangerous. This sounds like a dangerous situation all around, I highly recommend you record your ride so if someone does hit you, you can make quick work of the insurance claim. 

It's perfectly safe and sane to run 45 psi, that 55 psi minimum probably has to factor in the safety and likelihood of someone weighing more than you. Really you just run the risk of a sharp edge giving you a pinch flat, and it depends completely on the course, some courses might have more rocks and pavement than others. Personally I weigh more than you and I've run 45 psi on thinner tires for certain races. It all depends. You could even borrow a set of wheels and tires, and keep them in the pit in the event you do get a flat, that's pretty common practice for a cross race. 

Oh yeah, definitely put some 28s on there. They'll give you better traction, better handling ( especially on most commutes ), and more comfort. Go for a nice, durable city tire. Whatever you do, don't try to save money on tires, spend a few extra dollars on high quality tires and you'll never look back. Nice tires will last longer, perform better, and save you time and money by preventing flats. If you buy cheap tires, you'll just end up spending even more money on tubes. $URL$ Edit: Try to make sure the tire you choose fits your frame, your local bike shop shouldn't have any trouble helping you with this. 

In this image the cars have the yield triangle signifying the give-way. This seems to suggest, albeit not in writing, that the pedestrians have priority. That fits with the overall theme of the code that pedestrians have the priority at designated crossings that aren't signal controlled. 

You will have an easier time selecting the correct spindle once you have already selected a bottom bracket, because the spindle size is typically specific to each bottom bracket. Once you have the bottom bracket, you should be able to nail down the spindle size either from the manufacturer's instructions or on Sheldon Brown's database: $URL$ 

The manufacturer of each part determines the torque specifications. Most manuals and instruction sheets included with parts will list the torque specification of each bolt. Sometimes, on large parts like bottom brackets, the torque spec will be listed somewhere on the part itself. As for how to use a torque wrench in general: 

The weight of a bike has virtually no effect top speed. It takes very nearly the same amount of effort to maintain a speed of 30 mph on a 20 lb bike and a 30 lb bike on flat ground. The biggest factors that come into play at high speeds are aerodynamics and rolling resistance ( slick, efficient tires ). $URL$ That said, is top speed what you're really worried about? Probably not. Even if you like to bike fast, I truly, truly doubt you should be concerned with top speed. You'll probably enjoy a bike that accelerates quickly and feels nimble. Unless you live in a flat, remote area, in which case you probably wouldn't want a single speed, you're probably going to be accelerating and maneuvering more than you are achieving top speed. And again, these factors don't necessarily correlate with the weight of the bike. 

You should acquire a good dryer, the kind with the tray insert that you can set shoes on. Easiest way to dry your shoes every time. You're in Corvallis though, so there's it's a safe bet for me to wonder if you're in a dorm or apartment that doesn't have a washer and dryer. In this case what I do is prop my wet shoes in front of a space heater ( obviously, making sure that they're not so close that they get too hot ). 

You know, I worry that marketing firms have brainwashed the entire world into believing that you need to spend a lot of money on fancy materials that are waterproof and breathable. Honestly, just spend a few pounds on a poly tarp and your bike will stay as dry as the day you bought it. Just be sure that you take the bike out to give it some fresh air each day so that you don't have to worry about condensation building up and causing problems. You'd still have to do this anyway even if you bought something expensive, no matter how breathable the salesman promised you it would be. 

I've always used a quick release for the front of my fixed gear bike, I've only ever used the bolts on the back. His highness Sir Sheldon Brown says you should be okay to use a quick release with an enclosed cam ( not an exposed cam ) with an acorn nut that has steel teeth ( not aluminum teeth ). $URL$ disclaimer: there's no guarantee this is safe with your particular bike, modify with care and be safe. 

At the time of this posting, the solar chargers out there aren't very robust, unless money isn't a factor. If you're going to be camping each night, try the biolite camp stove. I haven't found anything that can charge my iPhone faster and it's relatively cheap, much cheaper than a good solar charger. $URL$ 

I can relate to your disdain for being passed to close. Preferably, everyone would give you at least 3 feet. But as you mentioned, as more and more people ride their bikes and drivers get used to your presence and others', it will get better. The problem with your wish is, it's kind of like prosecuting someone for stealing five cents from you. Sure, it's against the law to steal five cents from you, but no judge is going to hear the case. It's small potatoes. Too small. You could get one of those shirts that has the 3 foot rule on the back though. $URL$ 

I've had the same mixed results using the Edge 500 for courses. It sounds like you used a TCX file for the first course, giving you a better auto-zoom level and accuracy, and maybe a GPX file on the second course, resulting in less accurate performance. Sometimes though, it seems the little 500 just doesn't have the accuracy of other models and strays off course. To adjust the zoom level, page over to the map/course layout and press the power/light button. You'll see the zoom level is probably set to auto. Just use the up/down arrows to adjust the zoom level and hit enter when you're done. Generating TCX files with ridewithgps.com seems to be the most popular way to chart a course and add cues and turns. Most popular routes already exist if you search for them. For what it's worth, the newer models, 510, 520, 1000, etc, seem to have a much better grasp on your location ( and liekly extra processing power to help ) and throw up an off-course false alarm much less often, even under dense tree cover. 

The balaclava is definitely the way to keep your face warm. Try spraying your glasses with some anti fog spray to solve the breath problem. $URL$ $URL$ If you aren't willing to give up the abrasive pedals, you should just get some actual boots. 

Unless you are an elite-level professional cyclocross athlete, you will never have to worry about the rolling resistance of your cyclocross tires. And at that point you will be able to pay someone else to worry about those things for you. 

Depending on where you are, consider having proof of ownership before you go dismantling a u-lock. Before destroying the u-lock, see if tapping it with a pipe or hammer in various spots while jiggling the key does the trick. If it's good and seized up, time to cut through it with an angle grinder. If you don't already have an angle grinder, Ryobi has some very inexpensive models. 

I installed that Praxis BB30 converter on my Cannondale and I will never look back. I switched to a Shimano hollowtech II crank because that's the one I had lying around. Not only does it feel more rigid, but the bb30 was hopelessly noisy no matter how often I cleaned it, and the Praxis BB has been silent so far, the bearings seem to seal better. So yes, it's rigid, quieter, easier to clean, and my frame doesn't seem to mind. Those are my findings. Just make sure you use the proper amount of anti-seize when installing.
