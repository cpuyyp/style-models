I know that the Liar Paradox has been discussed a fair bit on here, but I have a question about it that seems a bit more fundamental. Perhaps it has been asked and answered here in more proper terminology and as such I just wasn't able to recognize it as my question, or perhaps I have fundamentally misunderstood the issue, but heregoes: I say something untrue. Then I tell you that I did. So in that case, in the second sentence, I have told the truth. But if it is true, then I actually lied. Is that the gist? Can one not just say that I told the truth about lying, in the second sentence, but actually lied in the first? And so there is no contradiction? I am assuming I have misunderstood, but I can't quite figure it out on my own. Zach 

I am reading a paper right now by Andrey V. Smirnov, published in the journal Philosophy East and West, Vol. 43, No. 1 titled Nicholas of Cusa and Ibn Arabi: Two Philosophies of Mysticism. Both thinkers had theories about the paradoxical nature of God, in that God is not Being, but as a result is still defined by Being, so is not not-Being, etc. To set up the logic behind this, Smirnov says "two possibilities exist to construct propositions that do not predicate something to the subject. To avoid something you must turn it either into everything or into nothing (nothing and everything are not something definite and so do not contradict the condition that the proposition about God should be indefinite)." Is this right? He says later on on the same page (66) that in the case of God as everything, "no limit can ever reach the Divine essence because, since it embraces everything, there is nothing exterior to it... [it] contains every possible limit within itself and by that very fact transcends all limits." Aren't we still in the same loop, so to speak? If God embraces everything, then isn't God a "thing" that just embraces everything else? Otherwise we would need to say that God embraces itself, right? And that seems contradictory? If something "embraces" the totality then that totality is not in fact a totality for something could encompass it, and neither is the thing that encompasses it for if encompassing can happen that implies separation (God as 1 and world as 1 coming together to create 2). Of course, perhaps this is just bad language on the part of the author? Does he just mean that God is the totality? But then in that case it is still defined by everything within it, and so must partake in its limits, no? The problem seems to be right there in the quote when he says that everything and nothing are not "something" definite. Even there, trying to define them as indefinite, he cannot help but refer to them as things. He says later, "To sum up, God is indefinable in the first case because God embraces all the limits." Are we not here positing a limit that embraces the limit, which would requires something else to embrace it, and so on and so on? As I understand these thinkers, they both take a dialetheic stance towards the issue. They are accepting both A and not-A, B and not-B, and not trying to reject either, which seems to be the way Smirnov is outlining it. He is looking for an indefinite way to describe a thing, rather than admitting that perhaps the thing has a truth-value gap? Do I have that right? 

Every material object/event has a cause (one observes this in daily experience). There must be a beginning to the chain of existence (as a result of the universe beginning with the Big Bang). Therefore, the initial cause must be a non-material being. 

Some points: Universality: We shouldn't assume that expletives all match English usage. Taking Catullus as an example, that curses in Latin often were not merely shocking as they are in English, they were often degrading and involved accusing the other party of being less than others. Effectiveness: Have you ever seen an argument won this way? 

In the "Unmoved Mover" proof, by talking about potentiality and actuality, we see God as the thing that brings actuality to everything, and as Thomas says ("nothing can be reduced from potentiality to actuality, except by something in a state of actuality"), God is in a state of actuality for all things. When Thomas gets to the transcendentals (Truth, Goodness, Beauty), he can then identify God with the transcendentals because God is the ultimate actuality of them (i.e., God is Truth, etc.). In the "From Contingency" proof, we see that God does not require anything (his existence is not contingent on anything). In particular, this means that he didn't need to create the universe, and that creation was therefore the ultimate act of love (because it was something done for its own sake, not for God's own). 

Of course, this depends on who counts as a "philosopher." In the title of the question, OP asks generally if he was the first philosopher king. I can think of two good possible non-Roman alternatives. Based on Plutarch's writing about him, Alexander the Great was a philosopher, since he loved learning and reading. Solomon also would fit many definitions of a philosopher. His desire and attainment of wisdom were both considerable. Many of the proverbs in the Biblical Book of Proverbs are attributed to him. As to Roman philosopher-kings, I found these possible (debatable) earlier examples: 

I have not played "The Talos Principle", so all my information came from the Wikipedia page of this game and your question. According to your question, humans developed an 'evolutionary algorithm' with the goal of developing some entity that could be classified as a "person". According to Wikipedia, an evolutionary algorithm works as follows: 

And while it is true that today's onlookers are correct that 'real intelligence' (which I'm calling "Strong AI" here) does not exist currently, if these onlookers will perpertually "discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program", that there's a real possibility that one day, these onlookers would be wrong...that "real intelligence"/Strong AI did occur. This is my fear: 

(As a side-note, the fact that the humans believe that it is possible to measure personhood by their external response to puzzles rather than philosophizing about the internal state of the AI means that the humans adhere to either Behaviorism or Functionalism. If you don't agree with two philosophical approaches, then it's possible that this entire question is moot and that it's impossible to build an AI that would reach "personhood" status.) 

Could this scenario occur? Or would it is possible, as soon as Strong AI exist, that humans immediately come to a consensus that it does exist? 

On the other hand, without an arbitrary definition of personhood, the evolutionary algorithm would not work. You need some way of measuring how close someone is to "personhood". In addition, the Wikipedia article for the "Talos Principle" does not mention anyone ever questioning the "use" of the evolutionary algorithm, so it's possible that humans have came to a consensus about how to define personhood. We may therefore wish to defer to their consensus. (Wikipedia calls this appeal to consensus as the "Group consensus" approach to solving the Paradox of the Heap.) So, back to your question. Is Elohim a person? My response depends on whether you trust the arbitrary definition that humanity has given to personhood.
