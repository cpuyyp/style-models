I'm not aware of any Shimano product which is used for measuring cadence with these particular drive train components, but you can find many good products that will work for this application. Having tried wired and wireless cyclocomputers, my preference is wireless, but both types work well. You can get good wireless cyclocomputers cheaply (that one has average cadence), so why go hardwired? 

I'm not a professional and I only ride 2500-3000 miles in a typical year. I never pay full retail for bike clothing unless I have a compelling reason. For example, some items are very rarely available for a discount. Typically when I need clothes I prowl the Nashbar sales, the REI sales, Chainlove and so forth, and I am patient (slow to buy). That said, you generally get what you pay for. Online reviews can be helpful, but you have to weigh reviews carefully, as it is possible some are shilled (paid) reviews. There is no substitute for personal experience, as other responders have noted. Saddles and bibs/shorts/chamois are highly personal, and what one person likes may be disliked by another. Neither of them is right or wrong in such circumstances. You can research this kind of thing to death, and I believe you are better off riding. Get some shorts or bibs, and ride with them. If you like them, buy more. If not, buy something different. 

I ride both SS/FG and approach climbing hills much of the same way I would if I were on a geared bike with one very big exception...MOMENTUM. When on a heavily geared SS/FG I gain as much speed as possible going into the hill and push hard to maintain it throughout the climb. Basic climbing tips: 

YES! I have had frame damage occur, but it was not from chain slap alone! As Daniel mentioned, it was on a steel steed, that led to corrosion. In fact it was on the very first bike in which I was totally smitten, a Ritchey P-23 :( Sadly, the chainstay did crack. Ritchey did repair, so all was not lost. The term ridden hard and put away wet...yep on steel frames with chain slap or any paint chips for that matter is not a good idea! Most of us keep our bikes in a garage or in basement rampant with moisture. The MIT (most important thing) is to dry your steel steed! Over the years I have seen this numerous times and just saw an old Serrota at the LBS with major rust to point where the shop was not going to do any repairs because failure was imminent. Most of my riding is in RI, along the ocean, so that may accelerate the corrosion. 

I think you could ride either size comfortably. You may need to change the stem to accommodate your longer reach, but the range of adjustment for the seat is what you want to look at, not so much the seat tube length. When you look at sizing, the reach is as important as the height. But good fit can be achieved within a range of values; I think it is better to think of proper fit as a range of values rather than a point estimate. 

Some say that if you can't have less than a "fist-full" of seatpost visible (>10 cm), the bike is probably too small. This is probably not a bad rule of thumb to start with. If you would post pictures of you sitting on the bike, with the drive-side pedal at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock, and 6 o'clock, that would be the best. It will be clear, then, if this is too big for you. Alternatively you can get a verdict from this fit computer. Even if you've never tried it, and you're a seasoned rider, the output is worth seeing. They give you three different fits: a competitive fit, an "Eddy" fit, and a "French" fit. In my experience, it's a great guide. However I have seen folks who ride bikes that are "too big" for them, and it can be done. Personally, I ride a bike which some would say is too big, but it works for me, and to-date I have about 1400 miles on that bike. When I am on the saddle, my toes just touch the ground. It all depends on how your geometry meshes with the bike. 

Slide back on saddle and drive heels through the bottom of the pedal stroke If you need to stand, do so while minimizing body sway and unnecessary counterproductive upper body motion Get into a rhythm - climb at your own pace Stay upright to keep lungs operating at full capacity Pull handlebars into your thighs as you drive pedals forward 

Watch the Tour de France...you'd be hard pressed to find a bike that is not carbon. Yes pros do get multiple steeds, but remember riding is their full time job. When was the last time one of us put 30-50 hours on a bike in a given week, never mind for 6-8 months! Now think about the wattage these guys put out and hopefully you are getting the idea...that carbon is a proven material. Do failures happen? Yes, but the frequency is so minimal and when it does occur it is not the instantaneous snap in half you fear. Furthermore, no multi-million dollar corporation would be able to mass produce a product that posed as serious of risk as you suggest. As far as carbon forks go, I use them on the road, as well as, cross and have never had a failure. Their ability to absorb vibration is unparalleled and I honestly cannot imagine riding a bike without one. I have a stable of bikes and all have carbon except one and that one has a suspension fork. My 29er MTB has a rigid carbon fork that replaced a ti rigid a couple years ago! Now having said that, I have been riding carbon frames on the road for 5 years and the benefits are unbelievable. I used to have a carbon mountain bike and it was phenomenal. Carbon is not the end all and be all. There are other materials that ride extremely well. Hope that helps! 

There are a lot of business that will strip/repaint a bicycle frame using quality paint. Cyclart (Some customers report issues with their service, however); Yellow Jersey; The Color Factory advertises in Velo News, $140 for a repaint with Imron; Joe's Bicycle Painting; Joe Bell's Bicycle Refinishing; And the list goes on... 

Before you rush to spend money on different bars and different shifters, have you ever considered a shorter stem? Perhaps a photo of your current bars/stem, and/or an actual measurement of your stem would help me to be more specific. You should measure it center-to-center, as shown in the illustration (3). 

It is hard to identify the sound from the video. In person it may sound different. I have a similar FSA crank on my bike and after some miles it was making a creaking/clicking sound. It was different that what I hear in your video. My crankset made a noise when it was under load, i.e., when I was pedaling. My friend tried three things to fix this: 1) tighten the chainring bolts; 2) lube/grease the crankshaft on the non-drive side; 3) remove the crank, and coat the threaded bearing holders/cups with anti-seize lubricant. Collectively, these worked. No more creak/click. Please note, some models of FSA cranks require a "wavy" washer to be installed on the non-drive side between the crank arm and the bearing shield. I don't know if this could be at the root of your issue or not. 

Studded tires are a must on ice. They are expensive, but well worth it! A couple of points to consider that have not been mentioned: Footwear: Winter specific riding shoes or boots. For mountain biking and cross, I ride with Lake boots. On the road, I use an older pair of road shoes that have been stretched to accommodate thick wool socks and neoprene shoe covers. Head-wear: I typically ride with a helmet cover all winter. I also bring along a couple different varieties of skull caps on ride ranging in thickness, ear/face coverage etc... yes to balaclavas!!! Depth of snow: whether you are running studs or not, my experience is that if the snow is deeper than 4-5 inches, it is not ride-able. In this case, it is best to wait until either the cross country skiers, hikers or plows(in the case of roads) have cleared or packed down the snow. Body Temperature: Many cyclists new to riding in colder weather tend to over dress. The trick that works for me is twofold, first absolutely dress in layers and second I want to be cold, not freezing, but cold as I go outside and get my bike ready or at the very start of the ride. If I am warm at that point, I will be sweat soaked in the matter of minutes and wetness is something you want avoid! Fender: Clearly, if the snow is dry, it is not necessary, but my experience is it is better to have one as a precaution than go without! Heat Packs: At extreme temperatures, I have successfully used heat packs in the tips of my shoes and palms of my gloves. I am not a huge fan of use in the palms, I very rarely and if i do it is usually just a temporary fix. Use of Car Heater: If I am driving to the ride, I preheat my shoes and as much clothing as possible using my car heater on the way to the ride. If you get yourself set up with studs, I would highly recommend finding a frozen lake or pond to ride on! The experience is phenomenal! If you can time the lake ride with 1-2 inches of fresh snow it will be that much better! I ride road, mountain and cross year round outside. Hope this helps! 

New road bikes are generally available from two sources: your local bike store (LBS) and online. Not all brands are available from both types of distribution channel. That makes it harder to compare apples to apples. Too, your LBS/brick & mortar retailer probably has a clearance sale starting sometime around August where they attempt to clear out inventory, so they can make space for next year's models. If you want to compare apples to apples, keep that in mind. You can get some very good deals in this way, which can be hard to beat online. The online-only sellers almost never have any kind of substantial sale. In light of that, let's look at a couple of examples. Lynskey Helix with full Ultegra drivetrain ($4950 assembled) vs. BikesDirect Motobecane Le Champion with full Ultegra drivetrain ($2100 assembled). These bikes are very comparable in many respects. Both have a titanium frame, but the Lynskey frame is made in the USA, whereas the Motobecane frame is made in Taiwan. The Lynskey frame has a certain cachet among cyclists which the Motobecane frame does not have. If you were to compare the two frames side-by-side, you may find that the welds on the Lynskey are slightly prettier than the welds on the Motobecane. (The frame builders at Lynskey might be using multiple layers of weldment to help achieve that.) The other components are pretty comparable; I own and have ridden many miles on both the Aksium and Equipe wheels, for example, and there isn't much difference. The fork on the Lynskey is nicer and more expensive, but apart from that, all the components are entirely comparable in terms of price and quality. You can read online reviews of both bikes, and they both review favorably. The price for the Lynskey, however, is $2850 more. This is sort of an apples-to-apples comparison, in that both bikes are available online and you can get them through certain dealers. Take another trio of road bikes and compare: Trek Madone 4.7 with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($3150 MSRP) vs. Specialzed Tarmac SL3 Expert with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($3900 MSRP) vs. Motobecane Immortal Force with a mostly-Ultegra drivetrain ($1600 MSRP). Look at the specs for each of these; you have nicer wheels on the Specialized, and there are other differences. But all the frames are made in Taiwan, so far as I know. A big part in the price difference comes from paying for the distribution channel. The dealer has to make a profit to stay in business. Trek & Specialized are mainly distributed through brick & mortar retailers; BikesDirect has some brick & mortar retailer distribution, but mainly they sell online. Full disclosure: I ride a Motobecane Le Champion with the titanium frame; I have about 4100 miles on the bike, and I'm totally happy with it. I also have a Trek Fuel EX 8 that I scored on clearance from a brick & mortar retailer. So I have no problem to buy either way. Bottom line, you have to decide how much you are willing to pay for brand name cachet and LBS support. But I think it is fair to conclude that the dealer-centric brands cost more. 

Both Neil & Ttarchala are spot on. The one additional comment or perspective that should be considered is with a smaller cockpit your body may not be stretched out enough and for me the impact of mountain biking on a bike with too tight a cockpit wreaks havoc on my BACK! Think of your spine as a coil...is there more flex when it pushed together or stretched out...that flex softens the ride and allows for more movement which ultimately improves your riding, is less taxing on the body therefore less fatiguing. Also, too long a stem tends to put too much weight forward which increases the likelihood of issues with your upper body and increasing propensity to endo :( Be careful..probably not a viable option! 

Here's the skinny from my perspective. Two factors: weight & aerodynamics Carbon wheels are super lightweight which requires less power to spin. Taller(Deep Profile) rims are more aerodynamic, so once moving they reduce wind resistance. Obviously, the taller the rim, the more material, therefore they are also heavier. Many folks talk about spin up, which means how quickly one is able to get the bike up to speed, when discussing Taller/Deep Profile wheels. The ideal wheel is a balance between these two factors, but then again, it really boils down to your goal? Are you racing? If so, what is type of racing? Are you able to afford/maintain multiple sets of wheels? This is a great question because it deals with the one area that many inexperienced riders underestimate. Wheels IMO, after the frameset, is the most important component of speed, weight and ride quality! Please keep in mind this is only scratching the surface, but nonetheless I hope it helps! 

Old-school racing bikes (I have two) are not as comfortable as old-school MTBs when you resume riding, especially if you have a bit of a gut. The upright riding position that the vintage MTBs offer (or a modern equivalent) is one of those things that can keep you on the bike until riding a road bike becomes more comfortable. When I resumed riding (as a middle-aged adult), I was fortunate to get this at a local garage sale for $20: 

If you're able to upload the ride to Garmin Connect, or Strava, you can get an estimate of calorie burn on the basis of speed, elevation, and so forth. If you were wearing a heart rate monitor, the estimate from Garmin will be much more accurate, but unfortunately at this time Strava does not factor heart rate into their calorie estimate.
