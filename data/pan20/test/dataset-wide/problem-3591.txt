As someone who is currently recovering from knee issues, I prefer swimming as it never aggravates my knee and is an especially good cardio exercise. 

Stronglifts 5x5 is a good program, but that doesn't mean it is good for you. While a starting squat of 45 might be reasonable to the average person, remember that as someone who is "extremely overweight" you are in essence squatting an extra 100-200 in body weight alone. This would be the equivalent of an average weight person starting with 145-245 in weights instead of the bare barbell at 45. A parallel squat is a natural movement of the human body, so if you are having difficulty performing a squat then that is your body sending you a warning message that something is seriously wrong. In essence, your leg muscles are not strong enough to support your body weight in a squat, and continuing to do so will ultimately result in serious injury. If you wish to do squats, then you must either use supplementary exercises to build the leg muscles until they can support your weight (hard), or lose enough weight so your muscles have less of a load to support (easy). Those are your only two options. Setting Goals I recommend re-evaluating your goals that led you to choose Stronglifts as a program. Is your goal to only gain strength? If so, modify the program to only use exercises that you can do with good form. For instance, maybe the leg press would work for you, as it mostly removes your body weight from the equation. Going this route will help build your muscles up to the point where eventually they will be able to adequately support your body weight, at which point you can attempt doing squats again. But as I said before, this route is substantially harder compared to losing weight. If your goal is instead losing weight, being healthier, or rehabilitating your knee, then I would recommend not pursuing Stronglifts and shifting your focus to another program. While SL claims to be great for all three of these goals, that is only in the context of the average person. In your specific case, you would be far better served through a program that revolves around dieting and cardio alone. Strength training runs directly contrary to losing weight, and your body weight is currently the biggest factor contributing to your health and your weight/muscle ratio. 

I have my own method for this and I'd like either confirmation that it's an acceptable solution or a reason why it's not and better alternatives. The reason I'm framing the question like this is because I like my method. It's convenient and it allows a practically unlimited amount of force to be used. (A lot of the articles I've read say that lifters sometimes need to add more force to get their mobility to change, due to having stronger/harder tissues.) My method is to lean forward against a wall with my feet some distance behind me and flat on the ground. The greater the distance from the wall, the more the ankle has to bend to accommodate the movement. If necessary, I move my feet further back and/or push against the wall hard enough to feel the stretch in the back part of my lower leg. I definitely feel it stretching my Achilles and calf, but my concern (leading me to ask about it) is that it may be leaving out other tissues that limit ankle dorsiflexion. As far as goals go, I want to be able to squat to depth without having to be forced down by weight. I can squat with reasonably good form with weight, but I can't get close to parallel (without my heels rising) with just bodyweight. 

To summarize from a study published in the nlm.nih, lifting at a moderate tempo will allow you to lift more than you can at a slower tempo. This is very intuitive, as the slower you lift the more strength you exert and the sooner you will reach exhaustion. The study also concluded that there is no discernible difference in hormonal response for slow/fast tempos; however, this is not to say that your metabolic response will also be the same when lifting slow/fast. The information I've seen has been largely divided this point, with most stating that the difference between slow and moderate is negligible. As far as recommended speed, that depends on you. It's important to realize that each technique has its own pros and cons, and you will have to weigh those pros and cons against your fitness goals and current situation to evaluate what will work best for you. Slow-pace: 

Just recently I noticed that I have a muscle imbalance in my chest. Even though I am right-handed, the left side of my chest (upper pecs, shoulders) are much more defined than my right. This mildly impacted my overhead press, but given the simplicity of the lift, I never noticed that there was a power imbalance. It wasn't until I started doing more technical and explosive lifts like the power clean that I noticed how severe the imbalance is. When doing cleans it is very hard for my right arm to keep pace with the left, and as a result when I come down to the lowest point in the lift at the catch, my left arm ends up taking the majority of the weight until the right arm catches up. Obviously this is very problematic, and something that needs to be fixed before I can continue doing cleans. My question is, what is the best way to address this imbalance and prevent it from presenting itself again? 

The fact is that nothing remains constant in the body. After any training period your muscles will go through a recovery phase, followed by a supercompensation phase. If you train or seriously exert yourself again towards the end of the supercompensation phase, those phases will repeat. If you do nothing, muscle atrophy will begin. The rate will be slow even if completely bedridden, but it will occur nonetheless. The big question then is how long is the supercompensation phase. And like all big questions, the answer is complicated. It depends on what type and intensity of training you've been going through, how long the macro cycle of training has been occuring, and how close to your body's potential you are currently performing at. For practical purposes, most people can easily take a week off without suffering significant setbacks. 

Cooking (whether baking, frying, grilling, or using a microwave) has a nominal effect on the nutritional value of foods. Using the uncooked data for calculating the post frying impact is fine. 

Simple answer: hip adduction. Use a machine or lie on your side and lift your lower leg up. Generally, there are lots of stabilizer muscles (e.g. obliques) that don't get exercised properly and lead to injuries of weekend athletes. Specifically targeting them with exercises like hip adduction/abduction and roman twists can help. Using free-weights with uneven loads or exercising only one side at a time can also help tremendously. 

Motivating yourself is easy enough, it's motivating other people that is tricky. As the saying goes, "you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink." The horse may be too stubborn to drink even though it's thirsty, it may be too embarassed to drink in front of others, or it may already be full of water and not want any more! Regardless of the reason, you will need to accept that outside of a company mandate (which may cause resentment by the employees) it will be near impossible to achieve a participation rate even close to 100%. That being said, there are ways you can encourage employees to participate which can improve your overall participation rate. 

Keep a journal of every exercise done each workout, and record the amount of weight lifted. In the journal, also record whether or not you plateaued or struggled at a given weight. When the time to repeat that exercise comes around, if you didn't plateau you can increase the weight by an amount reasonable for that exercise (anywhere from 2.5-10 lbs, typically). If instead you did plateau, attempt doing the exercise at the same weight/rep as before. If you continue to plateau, deload the weight by an appropriate amount (typically 10-20%) and work your way back up. 

Running is just one means to the goal of fitness. Personally, I haven't been running in any serious capacity for 22 years since I tore my Achilles tendons (yes, plural, as in both at once). Any activity that keeps your heart rate elevated (~70% HR Max) for 30-45 minutes at a time will do. Keep get in a enough sessions to total 120 minutes a week and your cardio needs should be handled. 

Arguments about low-carb vs. low-calorie diets aside, going much below your recommended daily calorie intake will send your body into starvation mode. This is bad and counter productive to your goals. 

Most gyms have personal trainers for hire. They'll know the lay of the land and what equipment you can use to achieve your goals. Typically they want you to sign up for a contract of several (6-12) sessions, but you can usually make it clear you just want someone to set-up a routine for you and not be your new workout buddy. 

The Nike Free 5.0 was one of the first running shoes designed to simulate barefoot running. The "5.0" was supposed to indicate that it was half way between running with a traditional shoe (10.0) and running barefoot (0.0). You might find the 3.0 to be good for regular running. There are lots of minimalist running shoes you just need to decide what it is that you really want. 

I'm going to use the "climbing hills" activity for the closest approximation to what you're describing. Climbing hills with minimal weight (9 lbs or less) will burn around 500 calories per hour at your body weight. If you increase the weight to 20 - 40 lbs, then you will be closer to 575 calories burned per hour. When carrying over 42 lbs, then you will be around 650 calories burned per hour. Source 

It is important for a company to promote fitness and activity in its employees, as it makes the employees healthier, happier, more productive, more loyal to the company, and greatly reduces the companies potential future medical costs. Arguably, the amount of money a company will save from its promotion of healthy living will be exponentially more than the cost of having an overly inactive workforce, thus these programs can pay for themselves and some! 

Supersets are an advanced strength training technique that allow you to increase the intensity of your workout while decreasing the time spent working out. Incorporating supersets will make your workout more difficult, but also more efficient. 

What is so special about the gym? Treadmills/steppers? Do the cardio outside. Freeweights isolation? Just use a pair of dumbbells with adjustable plates. Barbell strength routine? Buy a power rack for cheap off of craigslist. Whatever you can do in a gym, you can do in or around your house. 

Whether it's normal or not depends on how significant the difference is. It's normal to be slightly asymmetric. No part of your body is exactly symmetric. If it's significant enough for it to bother you, then you should consider doing exercises that are independent for each pec muscle. This is useful because, even though you try to balance it, with a push up or barbell bench, your body can compensate for a weaker side by pushing the weak side up faster. The physics of it makes the weight shift to the lower side. With something like one arm pushups or dumbbell bench, it's impossible to shift weight from one side to the other, so you should have equal development. To clarify in response to your comment below, you should do this independent exercise equally (same weight, reps and sets) for both sides. This will be easier for the strong side and harder for the weak one, so the weak one will grow more. Not doing so could possibly create imbalances where before you had none. For example, only doing one arm with dumbbell bench could cause an imbalance in your biceps, since the biceps is involved as a stabilizer in db bench. 

I've experienced this twice now. A few hours after my workout, I'll be lounging around (with my leg bent) and suddenly get a slight burn in my VM ("the teardrop"). If I straighten my leg, the burn intensifies. Is this a sign I really do need to start stretching post-workout or do I just need more potassium? I'm doing Strong Lifts, so my legs are getting worked pretty hard.
