I read recently some news about how MS will have to hand over data to the US government if they asked for it. ( $URL$ or $URL$ ) Some of our clients could be concerned by that. MS does have european datacenters, but i was wondering if anyone knew if these datacenter could be targeted too ? 

I'd recommend that you check appdeploy.com for informations on how to silently deploy your software. Most of the time you'll find here informations on how to extract an MSI from a .exe installer if it is supported by the installer. For instance, with the msn example : $URL$ 

I may be mistaken, but you can try to add a -i parameter, so that the process you're trying to launch will run in an interactive mode in the specified target computer. Edit : I just saw what you're trying to acheive, and I don't think you can acheive that with psexec, which is used to execute process on remote computers. Here, you may what to try an application presentation solution, like Xenapp or Windows 2008 remote desktop services 

I think you might be looking for 'erroractionpreference', this article explains through a few examples of how it works. $URL$ Given the other answer, if your script is larger than this function and you need to continue troubleshooting, then you'd need to wrap this bit of code by setting it at the beginning and setting it back to 'continue' after you are done processing. This will suppress non-terminating errors like that so they are not printed to your host. 

If I'm reading you right, then I guess it depends on how you're assigning IPs from your VPN and whether or not you have the capability of setting the DNS Server address, guessing you would but not every implementation is the same. You'd want to configure the zones that you want to be answered internally on that DNS server and leave recursion intact (although this is generally a bad idea if that DNS server is exposed to the public, as it opens you to potential denial of service attacks, and you might need to be more complex if so). This way your DNS server will answer what it can first and if it has no zone for the query it will forward to the internet roots by default. 

But I'd like to know what else people do for precaution, for example can you backup the entire IIS and all its settings? As re-creating all the sites and application pools etc... would be a real time consuming pain if the worst were to happen? Any tips / advice greatly appreciated 

For all the databases on the server. Its doing this more or less every hour? Is that right? I assumed once the database had started thats it unless I restart the SQL service or shut down the server? Any advice appreciated - Thanks. 

I run a little 1&1 web server with quite a few sites all powered by SQL Express Db's and have never allowed connections to SQL Express from an external resource (Anything not on the server), as I am paranoid of the databases getting hacked if I allow external access. What is the most secure way for me to allow a local program on my computer here to connect to my SQL Server on my 1&1 server? A step by step guide would be excellent :| 

You can either use the DISM utility from the WAIK to inject drivers to the WIM file, or there's a gui to do that (check $URL$ ) 

We can't really do our job correctly without scripting, and sometime these scripts can be difficult to create / debug with only text editors I'm currently using UltraEdit or Notepad++ as text editors and scripting platform (syntax highlighting is almost mandatory), but I was wondering if there was a more advanced scripting environment, an IDE of some sort, for VBscript and Powershell mostly ? (like always, free is better, but if the tool is really good I'm not against paying for it) 

You can have most of this using the PFsense firewall distribution. It allows you to easily setup a captive portal, manage a proxy for the users, block them with firewall rules. All is configurable through an easy to use web interface, and if you want more advanced features, you can always go deeper with command line. And all the hardware you'll need is a cheap computer with a wireless network card :D 

Sure. Create a GPO with a WMI filter scoped to Windows XP, and apply the deny logon interactively/locally rights to DOMAIN\Domain Users, that should prevent them from being able to logon. Although you might get some loud and rowdy responses, be careful of that if you have any concerns of more senior management frowning upon it. However, they cannot actually "hide" this from you. The operating system is included in the computer object and you can perform a powershell query to detect the systems that still report as that version of Windows. As I recall this value should update if they use install a new operating system. A powershell script that seeks out the values of each computer object's attributes called "OperatingSystem" and "OperatingSystemVersion" would tell you what you needed to know. For example on my workstation, these return: OperatingSystem: Windows 8.1 Enterprise OperatingSystemVersion: 6.3 (9600) (Major,minor and build#) Does that help? 

I am looking at creating backups of our C: drive in case we have a major HD or OS failure... This is a web server, so I want the fastest way of restoring IIS with all the settings and all the program files (SQL Server etc.) and read the built in 'Windows Server 2008 Backup' is what I should be using. So I basically want the C drive backed up so I can restore it to how it was before a failure... 

And restarted IIS, but nothing changed. It's still blocking Dots in paths. And then I restarted the entire server... And guess what. It's still blocking dots in path? I have no idea what to do next, apart from un-install it? Anyone else this issue? 

However, it's trying to append to the querystring d=9 on that page. But I have double checked that code for that site, and if has a numeric check and cast. And if it fails that (Which it does for the above query), it just returns nothing - Which is what the site is doing, and that SQL would not have been executed. So even more stumped now! Any other pointers appreciated.
