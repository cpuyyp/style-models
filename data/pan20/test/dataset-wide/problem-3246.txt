It is, to the extent that Nazis and neonazis are and were in the far right. It insn't, to the measure that there are other extreme right wing groups that are not Nazi or neonazi. 

"Modern" is one of these awful words that change their meaning with time. Longbows or catapults where once modern. But the question is more specific, and it requires that both sides in battle expected to inflict damage on the enemy by firing projectiles at a distance. And so, anything before the Napoleonic wars at very least is not the answer. Historically, footsoldiers were divided into archers and infantry proper. Archers were used to "soften" the enemy, so that a direct assault by cavalry or infantry would be possible. These two different functions of footsoldiers could only be fused into one with the invention of the bayonnet. But this still doesn't answer the question: while a bayonnet equiped infantry would shoot as it charged, the final assault was still supposed to be decided by non-ranged edged weapons - the gun, with the bayonnet, used as a pike. A further change happened when armies started to expect shooting their enemies rather than stabbing them, even in the final assault. While the fusion of infantry into one only force was quite sudden, with the bayonnet eliminating the need for separate bodies of skirmishers/chargers, this later change seems to have been much more gradual. The American Civil war battles, while probably dedided by gun power first and foremost, still featured violent final hand-to-hand clashes. The same is true for its South American equivalent, the Triple Alliance (or Paraguay) War. I am not sure of what proportion of casualties was exacted by bullets as opposed to those caused by blades (though I am sure both dwarfed in face of disenteria and other infectious diseases), but I very much doubt that the Union, Confederacy, Brazilian, or Paraguayan armies expected to damage their enemies mainly through bullets (as for the Argentinians and Uruguayans, I am pretty sure they expected the opposite). In WWI, though, it seems clear that all armies involved - or at least the main ones - relied on machine guns as their main weapon to inflict damage. This is complicated, though, because the final assault - the conquest of a trenchline - still relied on bayonnet assault, resulting in an enourmous advantage of defences against attackers, with the known results - industrial scale senseless butchery, culminating in social unrest among the troops, with four empires being destroyed in the process by the combination of enemy onslaught and internal uprisings. Such problems would only be solved by WWII style warfare - the use of armoured "cavalry", ie, tanks, plus tactical and then strategic use of air force. So I would say, it was a long process, that started after the Napoleonic wars, and lasted up to WWII. At some point, there were more casualties caused by gunfire than otherwise; at a later point, military planners learned to expect this as the "normal" way of warfare. 

Now, let's see what in this arrangement is merely a quirk of European history, and what is necessary for an unequal society that relies mostly in agriculture. First, a pesantry organised in individual families (instead of clans), is by no means a given. Most societies transitioned from hunter-gathering into agriculture and husbandry without breaking the clanic systems. And some went hierarchic without such a break either. In places such as the Inca Empire or India, the peasantry remained organised in clans (and some historians would say that this is characteristic of a non-feudal social formation, that they would diversely label as "Asiatic" or "tributary"). So, this feature seems to be not necessary for a hierarchic but pre-industrial society. But it seems that, barring slavery, the organisation of production in the basis of an exchange of rent for land access cannot be avoided. Wages can only become generalised in agriculture once quite stronger urban markets develop, which is only possible post-industrialisation. Second, serfdom does not seem to be a necessary feature. And indeed, European feudalism saw a general tendency towards the abolition of serfdom, which generally predated the end of other "feudal" relations, such as fiefs, vassalic hierarchies, rent, primogeniture, etc. On the other hand, serfdom can well be imposed into a clanic peasantry, so it is quite possible that some societies (again the Incas, ancient Egypt) had institutions similar to serfdom without individualised peasant families. Third, the peculiar urban/rural divide of Mediaeval Europe seems quite original, not being replicated by most non-European mediaeval societies (with the exception of Japan). This is not to say that those other societies did not have a urban sector; rather, non-European cities tended to be mostly political centres instead of manufacturing poles. Fourth, the fusion of political power and land ownership seems unavoidable, but its precise form in European feudalism is quite peculiar. In other societies, as again among the Incas, and in most of mediaeval Middle East, the State retained land property, and established its "nobles" as governors ("satrapes" as the Persians called them) but without allowing hereditary ownership. The characteristic European personalisation of the political/ownership fusion seems to have been only fully replicated in Mediaeval Japan. Fifth, again the fief seems to constitute an European (and Japanese) exclusivity. Sixth, and intimately related to the two previous issues, if land ownership is not to be divided indefinitely, to the point where it would cease to constitute the apanage of an actual ruling class, either primogeniture or State property of land seem unavoidable. Again Japan joins Europe in the characteristic primogeniture rule, but, although I can't claim enough knowledge of these societies, I suspect that Imperial China, as well as Mediaeval India and at least parts of Africa (namely Ethiopia) were under similar rules. Seventh, if primogeniture is the rule, "second sons" of the nobility constitute a problem, and institutions that attempt to solve it will be necessary. Evidently, the Mediaeval Catholic Church was unique and totally due to the precise history of Europe. But the Japanese samurai (which more closely relates to the European errant knightship, of course) are another, if less complete, attempt to deal with the problem. And one cannot fail to notice the similarites between Tibetan monasteries and those of Europe, although the evolution of each seems to have been completely independent. So, in conclusion, feudalism seems to be more than a European peculiarity, but less than a necessary stage in the evolution of all societies. But it is probably no coincidence that an early and internally controled transition to capitalism only happened in Europe, and, to some extent, in Japan. Societies that underwent no feudal "stage" or did so incompletely or dubiously seem to have only "progressed" into capitalism as a direct result of European/North American expansion. Sorry for the verbose answer, but the question is actually quite complex. For further reference, Perry Anderson's Passages from antiquity to feudalism and Lineages of the Absolutist State, and Barrington Moore's Social origins of dictatorship and democracy provide in depth study of both European and non-European societies and history, of which the above is in some senses an impoverished summary. 

This site details the hierarchy of a modern (WWII) battleship: Seamanship It seems to be lacking as to the relationship between in-ship responsibilities and military rank. I fear that this is more or less unavoidable unless we discuss each kind of ship separately, though: the commander of a destroyer or submarine would be probably be the Navy equivalent of an Army captain, whereas the commander of a battleship or carrier will probably be something closer to a colonel - and such quite certainly reflects on all official positions on board. 

I would have made first page headlines in the early 90s if true. No, I think Heinlein was led to this conclusion by ideology more than by observation. ETA: A source about the subject: Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis, by Timothy J. Colton 

To which I would add, not only in the United States, but in most, if not all, the world - certainly in Latin America and Europe at the very least. But not only that; the very idea that "home" and "workplace" are different locations is quite modern. The mediaeval serfs worked at "home" - women inside the house, men in the adjacent fields, except for the days dedicated to labour for the lord or the Church - when women would work in the lord's kitchen, and men in the lord's fields. The idea of a "workplace" distinct from residence, which must be frequented every day except Sundays, is a product of the Industrial Revolution, at least as a mass phenomenon. So we really do have two centuries in which the location of labour was starkly dictated by sex: in "normal" situations, women were supposed to work "at home", as always before, and men were supposed to work in a different place - factory, office, shop - during most of the day. In situations of labour power scarcity, women - particularly poor women - worked just like as men. This is clearly visible in the begginings of industrialisation, as portrayed by Dickens or Marx, or in the reports of British factory inspectors, and was also very clearly during the two "world wars". Even in "normal" situations, women did work outside of their homes, but their labour was usually related to "home-like" tasks - either as domestic servants or as teachers or nurses. And, of course, nuns. Related to which, it would be interesting to study in more depth to what extent and in which ways marriage and job were or were not mutually exclusive. Single women probably had a different relation to domestic tasks than married women, and celibacy as a life-long option was always open to women. Even so, there always were "stay-at-home daughters" - single women who took care of their aging parents, and helped sisters and sisters-in-law with nephews, grandchildren, disabled adults, etc. So I would say that, at least up to WWII, rather than a gradual movement towards women employment, we had more of a see-saw movement, women extensively engaging in industry and commerce when masculine labour was insufficient (wars evidently being one of such occasions) but returning to the household as soon as conditions were less traumatic. It is possible that this dynamics have been broken since WWII. After WWI, it took but a decade for women to move back from factories and shops into the household. And although a similar movement is easily identifiable in the 50's of the 20th century, it was never as complete as the backlash of the 30's. And then in the sixties this movement was reversed; the following depressive quarter century did not see the "normal" redomestication of women that used to be associated with economic recessions. This coincides with the final stage of "demographic transition": lower natality rates, made possible by modern contraceptives and social security nets, make motherhood a less overwhelming job. Plus the industry has spotted an important market in the automation of domestic tasks; washing machines, vaccuum cleaners, etc., also had a significative role in freeing the female labour power from the household and into capitalist exploitation in part- and fulltime jobs. I am not sure, however, that we are seeing an epochal change in the sexual division of labour, instead of just a particularly prolonged sway of the pendulum in the direction of employment of women. It is pretty clear to me that political demands of redomestication of women are starting to become more frequent and systematic - including this curious phenomenon of women who make a carreer out of telling other women that they should not have a carreer.
