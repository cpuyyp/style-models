Depending on what you mean by "should", you possibly "shouldn't" be riding on the pavement. After parking or walking on the pavement, I move back onto the road in a way that's similar to setting off from/in a parked car. 

Can a tire like the Schwalbe Marathon Winter be used for winter-long commuting (40 km/day) on roads which are mostly or usually not icy? I might want the studs occasionally (and lower the air pressure to get them), but not on most days. This is Toronto where it's subzero at night, with snow etc., for about 4 months (it's snowing today for the first time), but they plough and salt the roads. I wouldn't want to have to swap the tires daily or weekly depending on the weather: only once a season. 

Although safety is a big concern, I don't think that a helmet per se will keep you safe. Wearing a helmet may make the difference between being lucky versus unlucky, if you're in an accident. I wear a helmet (well, a hard hat): I'm not against helmets; but the other things you do, e.g. choosing where and how and when to ride, would probably have a bigger effect on your safety. I don't know that any helmet would impair visibility: it moves when your head does (and, I expect, stays up on the crown of your head instead of slipping in front of your eyes). I may be wrong but I think that what you're buying with a more expensive helmet would be: 

Ensure that semi-actuated traffic lights detect bikes Many of the under-the-road sensors which detect waiting traffic and control traffic lights have had their sensitivity adjusted in order to detect bikes: at least on bike routes. On my commute there are I think only two or three intersections where those sensors don't notice me and consequently I might wait 'forever' (or until a car comes along behind/beside me). During the day this doesn't matter (there's enough other traffic to keep tripping the sensors): so I only notice it when I'm on the road alone, at night. I could get off and press the pedestrian crossing button; but instead I stop (completely), wait until it's safe (no cars within 100m), and then cycle across against the light. This type of traffic light happens where a minor residential street crosses a main road. I don't see how that intersection could be redesigned: without a traffic light, in daytime where there's nearly continuous traffic on the main road, the occasional cars on the smaller road would never be able to cross the main road. And it wouldn't be worth putting roundabouts there IMO. 

Wikipedia articles say that glycogen is depleted at about the 2-hour mark; and it references articles which talk about caffeine, together with carbohydrates, to hasten recovery: although, they are talking about recovery after exercise, rather than continuing exercise. Collapse can also be caused by hypovolaemia rather than hypoglycemia (for which a cure would be to drink and manage your electrolytes). 

Some places to park only have a 'bike stand': i.e. semi-circular hoops near the ground, which you put your wheels in. 

In theory, wider (and possibly thicker) tires ought to help though that may be anathema on a road bike. E.g. I have a aluminium "hybrid" without suspension, with 700x32 Marathon Plus tires, which don't seem to me especially "buzzy" (I do like padded gloves though). If the tires were e.g. 32mm instead of your 25mm, that means the contact patch is bigger and so the pressure can be lower. 

For commuting I bought a bike with 700x32 wheels (following advice from Q+As on this site) and put 'Marathon Plus' tires on them. Those tires seem bullet-proof to me, and would surely take your weight well. 

Is it possible that the inner belt isn't working as well as it used to? The tires are still very rideable but is it likely that they're now significantly less reliable than when new? It's not nearly as visibly worn as shown on Schwalbe's 'Tyre Wear' page, which shows tyres that are "worn out" and "need replacing urgently", and which says, 

Perhaps you should get at least one lesson in person from an experienced rider: who can tell you what you want to know, and, correct anything you're doing wrong which you don't even know enough to ask about. I don't think you should "cycling in real traffic" with no experience at all and based only on what you read: there's more to it, it's more complicated or takes more skill, than only understanding the traffic signs. 

You can dip the light slightly (point it towards the ground). Even without considering politeness, you might prefer to illuminate the ground ahead of you, instead of (as you would on a lit city street) pointing it straight forward to be seen as maximum distance. 

Cycling and above zero, you shouldn't get too cold IMO if you keep pumping. Two pairs of thin socks seem much warmer than one (I think that one is breathable and two make an insulating layer), and warm gloves: for example on a dry +4C night in Toronto last week I wore cotton shorts, one or two jerseys (a zip on the outer one), bare arms (short or rolled up sleeves) and legs, and wool gloves. I stayed off my maximum exertion, to reduce sweat: and I noticed that downhill runs are colder. My non-cycling specific jacket lacks features you might find in a cycling-specific one: 

In the UK, I'm going to guess that it's roots, getting under the paths: because the cycle paths have (compared with roads) less foundation, are dug less deep, are narrower, and have no paved verges (e.g. "side-walks"). 

I have an aluminium frame. The top tube has become slightly scratched or pitted (by something hard, presumably, I don't know what; maybe while it was parked). Does it need maintenance (e.g. does the paint job need fixing, will it corrode/weaken without), and if so what? 

Unfortunately I expect that depends on how good your brakes are, and the weather (i.e. on whether your rims are wet, which reduces the effectiveness of brakes). In contrast my bike has hydraulic disk brakes, which are always more than strong enough to stop the bike (so that I never apply full squeeze to the front brake). 

If I use the calculator at $URL$ at a weight of 165 lb then for bicycling at 14-16 mph "vigorous effort" it gives 750 calories/hour. To spend 750 calories/hour running you need to run at 6mph (10 minute mile). So at that level of effort (750 calories/hour), to run 12 miles would take 2 hours, during which time you could cycle 30 miles. Personally I'd find the running more challenging. 

They work even when it's wet (I think that's because rims get wetter because they're closer to the ground; and, because they have a bigger surface area, they take longer to dry). Brakes that work when it's wet are especially useful when in traffic, or going downhill. Good brakes might also be useful on a cycle path in the evening: it seems that small children may find a flashing front light attractive, and hurry into your path to get a better look at it. 

I've never had prescription glasses but might like some. My left eye doesn't focus easily (I ride on the right side of the road, in Canada). If I look over my left shoulder, I can see behind me only using my left eye (the field of my right eye is obscured by my nose). It's hard to see what's moving towards me and how fast, at a glance using one eye, because the edge-detection is blurred. So I think I want driving glasses which: 

I imagine you have to push (not pull) your hands of the handlebars. Maybe it is a good idea, to part ways with the bike, and to get up into a more upright position (instead of head-first). There's video of people (e.g. someone in NYC) deliberately (and expectedly) running into obstacles and coming off: you could look at their technique. P.S.: Not the same technique as how to come off a moving motorcycle, which is heavier than a bike. 

Summary: a cable will [only] stop 'casual' thieves who don't carry a tool with them; and would be no deterrent to a regular/professional thief. 

She tried to phone her boyfriend (while I waited), but no answer. I soon saw she has some internal bleeding (abnormal swelling) within her elbow, though no exterior bleeding; and suggest she get it looked at (saying "I'm sorry, that's going to hurt more, later ... and I can't touch it, I think you should get that seen by a doctor, you'll want a bandage or something"); get her agreement; flag down a taxi for her to drive her to the hospital (and check that she has the taxi fare); lock her bike up where it is (thanks for having previously read matthew's advice in this thread); and ask if she knows where she is (so that she or her SO can retrieve the bike again later). At first she seemed to be behaving a bit on automatic: "yes I'm fine..." to the people who had stopped. Some shock or something as well as a brave face. The drivers related to her as a person, a social being, an autonomous adult, and let her brush them off. Maybe my being a cyclist helped me to relate, to be a bit more familiar/intimate, or physical: and to stay a bit longer when others felt it was time to get back in their cars and to let the traffic resume. FWIW, the one time I was knocked off my bike (a car hit me from behind), I didn't realize how badly I was hurt (swollen leg) nor how my bike was hurt (destroyed back wheel) until after the driver had stopped pestering me with his questions and apologies and his "Oh my God!"s: and had driven off, and left me alone, to discover how I was going to continue - a similar symptom: slow (or non-existent or automatic) thinking; shock or something maybe. 

I bought a "Bern Brighton" hard hat because it was cheap and comfortable and (I hoped) more likely to at least stay on, in an accident, than others in the store which fit less well. 

In answer to another question moz posted this link to a IHPVA research paper, which includes (on pages 15 though 17) results of testing the rolling resistance of different tires, at different speeds and pressures. 

I have never had a sore seat. I started riding 20 to 30 minutes every day, and worked up from there. I am much stronger now (after commuting 10000 km in a year) than I was. My power goes through my legs (I wear bike shoes), so only part of my body weight is on my seat (because some of my weight is instead pushing down on my leg[s]): I think that's what happening, anyway. The experience / riding style is very different from novices (e.g. children) who must sit on the seat, and have no strong legs. Aside from that, they do make "lady-specific" and other saddles. It's surprising how much effect even a small difference has. A lady's bike would never fit me. Yesterday I tried on several pairs (different makes, similar sizes) before I found a pair of shoes that are comfortable. Also my bike is a 'hybrid' style (the handle bars are flat, not dropped or raised): meant to be faster (tires and gears) than a mountain bike and more comfortable (riding position) than a racing bike. Perhaps you should reconsider your handle bars (etc.) as well as your seat/saddle, in order to make sure you are riding in a comfortable and efficient position, for the kind of riding you are practising at the moment. 

wdypdx22's "HITT" or "interval training" might be what a nutritionist who I talked to called Fartlek training, in case you want to Google that term too. 

Every (circular) route is partly up-hill and partly down-hill. Cycling (slightly) down-hill doesn't mean "low or no effort": you still pedal (or even pedal hard); but you go faster (or even much faster). You say, "I have a cheap road bike"; so I'm not sure how fast you can go, with safety. I have a nice suspension-less 'hybrid' with flat bars and great brakes and tires, and derailleur gears with a 'big ring' on the front; and I can keep pedalling (and going fast) even down-hill: and especially when it's "slightly" down-hill. Also because you're travelling much faster down-hill, you finish the down-hill parts more quickly (and so spend a higher proportion of your time going more slowly up-hill). 

Dare I loosen the "caliper fixing bolts", so that the caliper can move sideways? Or (instead of the rotor being too far to one side) is the problem that one of the pads doesn't retract properly, for some reason, so there's simply not enough total space between the pads for the disk? 

Hold onto something, e.g. a vertical pipe, when you need to balance at a stand-still like that. Also people advised me to: 

One thing I've read is that if you ever ride on under-inflated or flat tires, doing that can give you a pinch flat. 

Maybe it's the difference between, what do you call it, 'isotonic' versus 'isometric' work? What I mean is that, for example, it takes a human a lot of effort (force, power, or work) to try to move an immovable object: to push against a wall or something. In too high a gear you push and push and go nowhere (lots of power to go nowhere => 0% efficiency). In too low a gear it's too easy: you spin against no resistance; your spin rate is limited to ~120 RPM or so, i.e. can't increase infinitely; therefore (low force and limited RPM) you're limited in the amount of power you put out (it's less than your theoretical maximum power). Possibly there's an efficient 'cadence' (perhaps 90 RPM) which you might want to use on all terrain (up, down, level), and the right thing (the right way to use your gears) is to continually adjust the gearing for the terrain in order to: a) maintain some constant, efficient cadence (e.g. 90 RPM); b) maintain a high enough force/power output at that cadence (e.g. if it seems too easy then switch to a higher gear, or if it's too difficult then switch to a lower gear, to maintain the cadence).
