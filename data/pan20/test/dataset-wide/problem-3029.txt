According to this source (wiki) a keelhauling could take place over either the length or the width of a ship. A keelhauling over the length would be fatal, either through drowning, or through lacerations brought by contact with the ship. A keelhauling across the width (typically about one third of a ship's length) was a "lesser" punishment that might give the victim a fighting chance to survive. For instance, the dimensions of a sloop (a small ship) was something like 39 feet long and 14 feet width. It's much easier to imagine someone surviving over 14 feet than 39 feet. The practice existed, because there are documented instances, as another poster pointed out. For all that, the lack of records suggests that it was rare. It was administered for only the most egregious offenses, such as mutiny or extreme cowardice. More common forms of execution were hanging, or shooting, or in the case of pirates, forcing the victim to "walk the plank." To estimate the frequency of keelhauling, one can start with the more common forms of execution (not so frequent in themselves) and work "downwards" from there. 

Some countries have a "second" name that is derived from its most famous state or province. For instance, "Holland" is the most famous province of the Netherlands, Farsi (Persia) of Iran, etc. "Schweiz" or "Switzerland" is the most famous state of a country whose official name is the "Confederation of Helvetia." "Germany," in its English form, was named after a group of "Germans," as was Aleman (Alemani). But the country's "real" name, in its native language, is "Deutschland." 

Communism represented an existential threat to western capitalistic, democratic societies; Fascism, which started out as a "one country" thing, did not. If Italy, for instance, became fascist, that didn't mean that other countries would. As late as 1939, people like Neville Chamberlain thought that capitalist democracies could co-exist with the Nazis. (Churchill did not.) Few people thought the same about Communism. Its most disturbing feature was that it planned to "clone" itself in other countries, thereby creating a series of "national" revolutions that would add up to a world revolution. Either a national revolution in your country or a world revolution would be a disturbing thing to most people in power, and in fact, most people in most countries, unless you were already so downtrodden that the promise of any change spelled relief. Unlike fascism, Communism preached government from the bottom up. That is, the dictatorship of the "proletariat," the workers in Russia, the peasants in China. Although the movement was led by middle class people like Lenin, it was not really in the interests of that group. A middle class person could not feel safe in a Communist regime supposedly run for the benefit of the proletariat, with the possible exceptions of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. Worse, the capitalist class could sabotage the new nation by "going on strike," because they knew best how to maximize the value of productive resources. Forget, for a moment, about China and Russia, and the fact that their industries took years, even decades, to recover from numerous failed "experiments". Perhaps the best example of this potential for collapse was Zimbabwe. 

Saudi Arabia encompasses large deserts, and industrial goods have a low "value to weight" ratio. The goods that are likely to be shipped across such deserts have a high value relative to their weight, such as cinnamin, silk, and precious metals. At the time of the Industrial Revolution (in Europe), most people of Saudi Arabia were still nomadic. People who are nomads are not likely to build factories to "industrialize." Also, at the time of the industrial revolution, the Hejaz, or the most advanced parts of Saudi Arabia along the Red Sea, was directly under Ottoman rule, rather than being part of the "vassal" state known as Saudi Arabia. $URL$ Only in modern times has Saudi Arabia had a commodity, oil, that makes it worth industrializing. 

The answer appears to be yes, according to sources such as this: $URL$ Pressure from the Huns apparently "induced" the Germanic tribes to do what they basically wanted to do anyway: head for warmer climes in the south and west. Following the victory of Arminius in 9 A.D., the Germans began to "push back" the Romans away from their homeland. Three centuries or so later, Hun pressure to their rear put the Germans on a "short fuse," with any "mistreatment" by the Romans, real or perceived. By this time, the Germans feared the Huns more than the Romans. 

The Soviets and Japanese were operating in two different worlds. So the respective "characterizations" were relative to their worlds, not compared to each other. The Soviets suffered mainly in comparison to the German forces, which were the best trained and led in the world. Even the Finnish forces they faced in the Winter War were (indirectly) German-trained (under Mannerheim). The Japanese distinguished themselves in combat against poorly armed Chinese, badly trained "colonial" (not elite) British and Dutch forces, and unprepared American forces. This was true even for Japanese units equipped with World War I vintage weapons. But when they met, the modern, Europeanized Soviet forces beat the backward, Asiatic Japanese forces. Specifically, the Soviets had good tanks that the Japanese couldn't counter. And Marshal Zhukov was the most able Soviet commander, who found himself in the Far East for "political" reasons. 

Horace Greeley was a "Radical" Republican, whose primary interest was the freeing of the slaves. In this, he differed from "mainstream" Republicans who were driven by economic interests (pro business, pro free labor, pro free soil). Lincoln was basically "agnostic" on the question of freeing the slaves, or the African-American question generally. His response to Greeley was addressed the fact that Greeley represented only a small percentage of Republicans, and that Lincoln might be able to manage without his "faction." As it turned out, he couldn't, so Lincoln promulgated the Emancipation Proclamation. People who shared Greeley's views didn't number "twenty million" but were numerous enough to make a difference. Basically, the exchange offered Greeley an opportunity to "declare victory and go home." His stance after the Emancipation Proclamation was, yes, Lincoln was "bargaining" with his statement, but he eventually came around. 

Alexander was called "the Great" by historians shortly after his death in his early 30s. During his short life, we conquered essentially all of the modern Middle East and Egypt, starting with a base of Macedonia, a kingdom near Greece. In the process, he defeated much larger, mostly Persian armies, in an unbroken series of battlefield victories and successfully campaigns that are studied even to this day. Had he lived longer, he might have united large parts of Europe and Asia under Macedonian rule. Despite his bellicosity, his rule was mainly benevolent. He treated conquered peoples kindly (relative to his time), and encouraged his Greeks to intermarry on equal terms with these people. Thus, Greek civilization spread throughout much of the Middle East with little further bloodshed. He also supported the development of learning, and his tutor, Aristotle, plus earlier scholars such as Socrates and Plato, were passed along to later generations as members the great minds of antiquity. 

Because "communications" (as defined below), didn't encourage spreading out until the late 19th century. The first form of "communications" was weaponry. Until the late 19th century, "guns" such as muskets and early rifles, were single shot weapons that could be fired only a few times during the battle, in its preliminary stages. Most of the serious fighting was done with blade weapons such as bayonets (or sabres for cavalry), which required mass action. It was the discovery of "repeating" weapons in the late 19th century that changed that. First the repeating rifle, then "machine" guns, or at least predecessors such as the Gatling gun or Maxim needle gun. If you had guns that could fire, say 20 shots a minute with reasonable accuracy, bayonet charges diminished in importance, and "spreading out" started to make sense. The second issue of "communications" was the standard one. Radio was developed in the late 19th century, and it was much easier to communicate orders to "spread out" units after, than before, radios. Ditto for telephones, or variations such as walkie-talies after 1876. Air power also played a factor starting with World War I; airplanes could drop flares signaling points of attack, concentration of fire, etc. 

The Missouri Compromise was nullified by the Compromise(s) of 1850 which in turn sprang from the American success in the Mexican War. The South had earlier agreed to the Missouri Compromise, because the Louisiana Purchase contained a lot more territory in northern, rather than southern latitudes. Under these circumstances, the North would eventually end up with more states, so the South bargained instead, for the "fast-tracking" of Missouri, and later of Arkansas, as slave states. The South later regretted their bargain, because the "compromise line" of 36 30' (the southern border of Missouri) was well south of other slave states, including Kentucky, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware. The Mexican war changed all that, by giving America access first to "Texas," (a natural slave territory that the South hoped would be subdivided into several slave states). Other territories won in the Mexican War included the New Mexico Territory, the Utah territory and California. Of these, only California (admitted as a Free State in 1850) was definitely made free by the Compromise of 1850. If not for this, and the fact that America split the Oregon Territory with Britain, the South might have had more territory to expand into than the North. This changing balance of power emboldened the South to try to "roll back" the slave line north of 36 30' to include Kansas, which is on the same latitude as Virginia, increasing the possibility that Colorado, Utah and Nevada would also become slave states. 

Let's create a timeline: The Haskell Free Library was "spaded" in 1901 and completed in 1904. It was deliberately built across the border in order to foster better U.S. Canadian relations. Although the entrance was placed on the U.S. side, Canadians can now go to and from the Canadian border and that entrance without passports or any border controls. The International Boundary Commission was created in 1908. The law now says that no one may build within 3 meters of the originally surveyed line without the permission of the commission, but that was not applied ex post facto. One purpose of the library was to deter such an ex post facto application of the law to other line houses. I don't know of any buildings that were built either in disregard of the law, or with permission. 

The Latin American countries that "projected" naval power were the ones that had naval power. Notably Argentina and Chile. There were a few reasons. First, those two countries had the longest coastlines of any hispanic South American country (Brazil was Portuguese.) Second, they had more English (read "naval") influences than the other Latin American countries. (Chile had Admiral Cochrane, for instance.) Third, it was easier for either country to project naval power to Peru; Chile, obviously, Argentina through the Straits of Magellan, with the ability to resupply in Chile. Of course, their navies could go to the north Pacific as well. On the other hand, countries like Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico (whose ports were mostly on the Caribbean) would find it hard to project naval power to Peru or other Pacific coast destinations in the days before the Panama Canal. (They would have to go all around the Southern Cone.) Ecuador and Bolivia (which then had a seacoast) were "too small" in terms of economy and population. Peru was the last Spanish colony to be liberated, by others, not through her own efforts, so she wouldn't have sent forces to fight Spain elsewhere. The Mexican navy wasn't created until 1821, when its war of independence was basically won, whereas the Argentine navy had been created a decade earlier, at the beginning of the independence struggles, and the Chilean navy in 1817. The Colombian navy played a limited role early in the war of independence because it was blockaded by the larger Spanish navy, but distinguished itself in the Battle of Maracaibo in 1823, in Venezuelan waters. 

In World War II, the United States had the assistance of the Soviet Union and China, countries with two of the largest armies in the world, that tied down large numbers of Axis troops while the U.S. administered the coup de grace. In Korea, the United States was fighting both China and the Soviet Union, the former, "officially," the latter, tacitly, who provided T-34 tanks (then, among the best in the world) to the North Koreans, as well as diplomatic support. Not to mention MIGs, some of which may have been manned by Soviet pilots. 

Corn is the most versatile of crops. Rice needs a nearly tropical climate in which to grow, and also lots of water for paddies. These conditions are present mostly in Southeast Asia. Wheat is a northern crop that does better in dry land. It grows best in Kansas, and areas to the north, and areas to the west of that state. Corn can be grown in "subtropical" areas such as parts of Mexico, but without needing as much water as rice, and grows well fairly far north, up to parts of Nebraska and basically the Great Lakes region as long as there is enough water (more than is needed for wheat). Thus, it is the crop that is most representative of "growing" climates. 

Japan had stored up enough oil for one year's worth of war. When the United States (Japan's main supplier), imposed an embargo on oil (and other goods) in July, 1941, Japan had to do something. That "something" consisted of two parts: 1) a "first strike" at Pearl Harbor to cripple the U.S. fleet and 2) an invasion of Southeast Asia, that was the key to most of the oil Japan used for the duration of the war. $URL$ $URL$ This included the Hong Kong, Philippines and Indochina, then Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and "island" Malaysia, at the southern part of the map (specifically the islands of Borneo and Sumatra). The latter three areas were a great source of oil (or refineries, in the case of Singapore). Japan got a little bit of oil from Manchuria, and Siberian Russia (a neutral country), but not nearly enough.
