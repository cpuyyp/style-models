Fuel Mining Let's say there's an aspect to FTL travel in your 'verse that requires the manufacture of a very expensive compound, a key ingredient of which can be harvested from the atmosphere of your planet, call it Element-X Element-X is rarer than rocking horse droppings, but it's emitted from a couple of huge volcanoes that have been spewing massive amounts of it and other toxic crap into the atmosphere for a couple of hundred thousand years. Element-X breaks down quickly outside of it's natural environment, so your city has to hover directly above the volcanoes as close as possible to maximise the Element-X they harvest. But if it gets any lower then planetary conditions and/or volcanic exhaust compromise the citys infrastructure, it's something they can tolerate for short amounts of time maybe as a defensive mechanism. Make your city like a vertical tube with the upper end protruding above the atmosphere, this will allow visiting ships to dock without getting too deep into the gravity well or having to bother with rigging their ships for atmospheric conditions or landings. Also makes it a lot easier for those ships to leave. So your tube city has a figurative and literal upper and lower class. The lower parts of the city won't get much light, that'll be where the heavy industry and harvesting takes place. It'll be a whole bunch of no-fun to live there. The upper sections of the city are where the exotic ships come and go, where the elite work in a bright, bustling cosmopolitan environment. They have the opportunity to travel unlike the "underlings". They'd also be physically closer to any attacks from pirates, so maybe there's an implied historical-societal debt. The "angels" might've successfully defended the city in the past (think Battle of Britain) and aren't shy about using that fact as justification for keeping the underlings in their place. After all, only the elite are smart enough to be pilots, right ? 

Your main problems won't be with vehicles. Cars can run on wood-gas with unsophisticated modifications, so fuel's not the biggest problem. Batteries can be recharged and reconditioned and basic ones aren't that difficult to make. Spare parts can be sourced from the millions of abandoned vehicles all around you. A lot of those vehicles will be relatively protected from the elements, and lets not forget the thousands of junk yards we've got with spare parts already stripped and sorted for you. Your biggest problem will be the infrastructure, the roads basically. Keeping cars running should be within the capability of most small communities, that gear head who used to bore you at parties ? He's pretty damn essential now. Now hands up everyone who knows someone who can fix a road, or a bridge, how about a tunnel ? Even if you did know someone the resources they'd need would make road building and repair out of reach for all but the largest and most developed of communities. 99% of modern cars will be usable only until the potholes get too deep, a couple of winters basically. You can go for specialist vehicles, off road, amphibious even, but the less mainstream the vehicle then the harder it'll be to maintain them. Personally I'd opt for a truck that can run along railway tracks as well the road. Railways and bridges won't have as much wear and tear, they'll last longer, they won't be blocked by 1000s of abandoned vehicles, most rail tunnels will be passable. You can switch between road and rail as needed. 

Tech is first developed mostly for altruistic reasons or in direct answer to an impending problem. It's further development and exploitation are driven by what we euphemistically label "market forces" or base human vices to be direct. Broadband and video compression are two cases in point. Initially developed for research or "higher" reasons, they were driven and financed in large part by the adult entertainment industry (src: I worked there). Think back to the late 90s. You need faster speeds to download data faster and unless you collect Linux ISOs then video files are the usually the largest you'll access in those days. Now, what is the most popular content on downloaded video files?? Porn. So suddenly the porn industry has a vested interest in getting their content to the consumer quicker. That means faster line speeds and smaller files, so they invest in video compression and xDSL technologies. So androids....Same sorta deal. The Westworld TV series has tapped this pretty well. Androids are developed for research or altruistic reasons, but their widespread use is to sate human society's baser appetites, humans either fight the androids or fuck them, simple as that. The money they pay for that privilege may help fund further android development and that is why the android creators can tolerate their machines being used in such a degrading manner. Androids are like the ultimate canaries in cages. You can (ab)use them to the point of destruction with no consequences. You can use them for serious purposes or just for shits and giggles, they're not human so who cares ? 

Flood it Make sure the tunnel runs almost exclusively underwater and flood it with seawater. Seismographic equipment and measurements probably won't detect it, likewise any "deep" radar technologies that might exist in your world. It'll basically blend in. 

Using families as hostages; not everyone's got a family and for those that do, not everyone loves their family. Disinformation: you said this was one kingdom, so there are other nation states. Any lies or propaganda spread by your kingdoms govt about magic users would be quickly disproven by sources of news from other nations. Drugging them; you'd have to be 100% effective 100% of the time, it only takes one to slip through the net Using other magic users; you can't use the MUs to police themselves. All the "police" MUs will be on the other side of the baton one day, they'll need as much goodwill as possible from their neighbours and peers. 

Soo many problems with this. For a start your ship is gonna mass a metric fun-tonne more than it did. You need more powerful engines, you're slower and a hell of a lot less maneuverable, both of which are prime considerations for combat vessels. Now you've got to make sure that all the equipment in the liquidified area still operates at 100% efficiency, does your liquid conduct electricity ? That's a whole new set of birthdays right there. To get conventional electronic equipment operating continuously "underwater" is gonna require them to be waterproofed, adding yet more mass to the ship. But assuming you can deal with all that, how do you change a hard drive or a graphics card underwater, reassemble the computer and get it to work without shorting out ?? Your airlocks, or liquidlocks, now require plumbing equipment instead of just vents. How do you move the liquid around the cabin ? Air flows pretty easily but liquid needs pumps (heavy) which need maintenance and power. How do you eat ? How do you cook food ? I'd love see how the bathrooms are plumbed :) And how do you clean up a trivial mess ? If my bag of chips bursts open on my desk it's no big deal to sweep them up and vacuum them away. Now try it underwater... How would your crew members talk to each other ?? That was fun, thanks :)
