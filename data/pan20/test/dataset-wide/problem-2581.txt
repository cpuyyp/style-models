According to Buddhist teaching, you will be re-born until you attain Arahantship. According to Buddhist teaching, Arahant consumes food in moderation until there Parinibbna. 

Buddhism teaches about higher consciousness such as Deva or gods. However, Buddhism does not teache a one creator God or one and only god overpowering you.Gods can help you like any other human can help you but not with eliminate your suffering, unfortunately. ================== Scattered throughout the suttas are references to as many as thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during their long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily grim and painful hell realms all the way up to the most exquisitely refined and blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is temporary; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to their past kamma. When they pass away, they take rebirth once again elsewhere according to the quality of their kamma: wholesome actions bring about a favorable rebirth, while unwholesome actions lead to an unfavorable one. And so the wearisome cycle continues. The realms of existence are customarily divided into three distinct "worlds" (loka), listed here in descending order of refinement: The Immaterial World (arupa-loka). Consists of four realms that are accessible to those who pass away while meditating in the formless jhanas. The Fine-Material World (rupa-loka). Consists of sixteen realms whose inhabitants (the devas) experience extremely refined degrees of mental pleasure. These realms are accessible to those who have attained at least some level of jhana and who have thereby managed to (temporarily) suppress hatred and ill-will. They are said to possess extremely refined bodies of pure light. The highest of these realms, the Pure Abodes, are accessible only to those who have attained to "non-returning," the third stage of Awakening. The Fine-Material World and the Immaterial World together constitute the "heavens" (sagga). The Sensuous World (kama-loka). Consists of eleven realms in which experience — both pleasurable and not — is dominated by the five senses. Seven of these realms are favorable destinations, and include our own human realm as well as several realms occupied by devas. The lowest realms are the four "bad" destinations, which include the animal and hell realms. The information on this page was assembled from a variety of sources. In the interests of economizing space I have not attributed each fact to its respective source. $URL$ 

For most of human history your word truely was your bond.. It was everything, and to lie was to put the reputation of your house, your family, and yourself in danger to the point where you became an outcast or worse. These days things are different in many ways, our words are not necessarily connected to our social and physical survival, but they are still important. When trust is lost it is not so easily gained back. So do i believe anyone who lies will also kill people and do horrible things? Most likely not, but deliberate lieing is a dangerous thing that is unskillful and not beneficial to yourself or others. It puts us back along the path and is to be avoided at all costs. 

The way I understand, the holocaust or atomic bombing of Japan can be explained by dependent origination and Kamma. what is important to understand is that all are not the result of Kamma. 

It appears to me those Brahmins believed in none existence. It appears they did not believe in kamma and rebirth. What Buddha taught was the dependent origination. It is not enough to understand the not self. That has to be realised through dependent origination. 

Perhaps this could be the problem. Just let go off the impatient and let the life take it's own path. Make sure you follow the Noble Eightfold Path though. 

Devadatta, a relative of the Buddha, at one point attempted to cause a schism in the sangha by asking the Buddha to implement 13 ascetic rules for all monks, one of those rules being vegetarianism. The Buddha in his wisdom decided against forcing these rules on all monks and instead stated that any monk who wished to take on these rules for their practice may do so. There is also nothing in the precepts that state anything about eating meat or vegetarianism, although I have been told that in the Mahayana they do add that as part of the precepts and the Bodhisattva vow. In those days, and also in at least the Theravada tradition, the monks had to eat whatever was given to them as they were/are totally dependent on the laity for support. Today if you wanted to feed Venerable Yuttadhammo and gave him noting but Oreo Cookies, he is bound to eat such food. The one exception being explained in the other post about if an animal is killed just for the monks, then a monk can refuse. These two links should be very helpful in the discussion regarding Buddhism and vegetarianism: $URL$ $URL$ 

The Eightfold path is practice in many different levels. The eightfold path practice by five preceptors is not the same as an Arahant. To answer your question as a lay person you are expected only to follow the Eightfold path in line with the five precepts. So there is no need to give up all your passions and desires. As a layperson, you can practice eight precepts on Uposatta days. This is optional. 

The Blessed One (Bhagava) The Buddha is endowed with the six things: (1) Lordship [Issariya], (2) Doctrine [Dhamma], (3) Fame [Yasa], (4) Glory [Siri], (5) Wish [Kama], and (6) Endeavor [Payatta], thus He is called the Blessed One. 1). He has the supreme lordship over His own mind as follows: i. Anima – power to make the body minute (e.g. making the size of an atom), ii. Laghima – power to make the body light (e.g. walking on air), iii. Mahima – power to make the body huge, iv. Patti – power to arrive where He wants to go, v. Pakamma – power to produce what He wants by resolving, etc., vi. Isita – power to make anyone or anything follow His wishes, vii. Vasita – power to create at will water, fire, etc., and viii. Yatthakamavasayita – power to attain the perfection in all ways in Him who wants to go through the air or do anything else of the sort. 2). He has the supramundane Dhamma. 3). He has the greatly pure fame, spread through the three worlds, attained through the quality of veracity. 4). He has the glory of all limbs, perfect in every appearance, which is capable of comforting the eyes of people eager to see His material body. 5). He has the wish i.e., accomplishment of whatever is wanted by Him whether it be for His own benefit or for another’s (others’). 6). And He has the endeavor, the right effort, which is the reason why the whole world reveres Him. $URL$ 

As far as I can tell the "Animal realm" includes insects. It is a sentient being and I don't see why they wouldn't be a part of samsara. 

I believe initially the robes were mostly yellow as this was a color of renunciation in the locality at the Buddha's time. As the Dhamma-Vinaya spread the different robe colors occurred due to the local dyes monastics used in their respective localities being different shades and colors. I do know that in the Theravada tradition at least in Thailand and Sri Lanka there is a differentiation in colors between forest monks and city monks. This may be helpful : $URL$ The robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances: roots and tubers, plants, bark, leaves, flowers and fruits. They should be boiled in water for a long time to get the dun dye. Saffron and ochre (from the jackfruit's heartwood) are the most prevalent colours today. Though there is a tendency amongst forest monks to wear ochre and city monks to wear saffron, but this is not always the rule. 

You experience Nibbana while you are alive. What you experience after death will be the same. Obviously, there is no rebirth and there is no physical body or consciousness to experience it. 

Thanks all. Based on your answers I came to the following conclusion. Papanca is the unwholsome Vicara just before the first Jhana. Further reading. $URL$ $URL$ ... ca/5706/10 

Say you are an American. (as I do not know your nationality) Now imagine that there is only this earth without any boarders. (no countries but one world) Now imagine we all help and look after each other as one human from earth. We do not have wars between countries. (because there is only one world) Now you expand this concept to whole world without any discrimination and extend your love and compassion to all (animal,human, Deva or even the beings in lower worlds) That is how I see the immeasurable mind. 

I remember going to my first Theravada Vihara years back and thanking them for coming to teach westerners. The monk there made a great point in response, they came because the area had a population of Sri Lankan people who requested them to come, not for some grand vision to bring dhamma to the west. Very few monastics, at least in the Theravada, came out of a desire to spread dhamma in the west. they came as their laity moved west. We are the secondary beneficiaries of that movement. Ive been to that Vihara many times and it is obvious that while they do teachings in English, their man focus is there laity from Sri Lanka. Now there is at least one person who has dedicated the last 30 years of his life to bringing dhamma to the west, and that's Bhante G(author of mindfulness in plain English) who created Bhavana Society. While most Viharas are places for Sri Lankans to come and socialize, Bhavana Society is a no nonsense meditation center that people visit from across the world. This is the kind of place a westerner wants to be and is fully part of the community. This is the type of place to find. 

In the Buddhist scriptures there are references to the Buddha or one of his disciples meeting and debating with Jains. In virtually every instance the Buddha or one of his disciples wins the debate and the Jain converts to Buddhism. A less than favorable light is also portrayed to the founder of Jainism, Mahavira. When we compare the vast amount of similarities between the Buddha and Mahavira and Buddhism and Jainism, it is possible that the differences were even less in early Buddhism. A more drastic change may have occurred when Buddhism placed less emphasis on ahimsa as can be seen in Buddhist writings that tend to justify and allow meat eating, for example. It is possible that the early Buddhists were more insistent on vegetarianism as additionally evidenced by King Ashoka who wanted to gradually phase out the killing of animals for food. King Ashoka ruled and lived before the Pali Canon was put to writing. There are marked differences in the definitions of kamma and nibbana (karma and nirvana) and the Buddha was practicing asceticism prior to enlightenment. In light of these facts it is possible that both Mahavira and Buddha were practicing some form of Jainism/Shramana/asceticism and the Buddha got it right (and was the actual new enlightened one to teach the masses, not Mahavira) in regard to nibbana and kamma but both were insistent on ahimsa and many other teachings. $URL$ 

For Theravada and some Mahayana traditions becoming a lay Buddhist is as simple as taking refuge in the Triple Gem of the Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha and taking the 5 precepts. This is usually at a ceremony and "given" by the monks however the true taking of refuge is something done in the mind, not recited or given. You are in short taking refuge, showing trust in the Buddha and his awakening, the dhamma as the truth, and the sangha as the keepers of that path, more specifically the aryan(awakened) Sangha and also all monastics. Then you attempt to live a more skillful life that is beneficial to yourself and others by following the precepts to the best of your ability. The ceremony usually involves a recitation in the Pali for Theravadan or the cultural language for the Mahayana. This link to Bhikkhu Bodhi's article on the subject is great for further reading on the subject. $URL$ Going for refuge, recited x3 Buddham saranam gacchami I go for refuge to the Buddha; Dhammam saranam gacchami I go for refuge to the Dhamma; Sangham saranam gacchami I go for refuge to the Sangha. And precepts: (1) the training rule of abstaining from taking life; (2) the training rule of abstaining from taking what is not given; (3) the training rule of abstaining from sexual misconduct; (4) the training rule of abstaining from false speech; and (5) the training rule of abstaining from fermented and distilled intoxicants which are the basis for heedlessness. 

I think this ideas are initially coming from Visuddhimaga and then from Abhidhamma Sangahata. Some commentators do not attribute this to Buddha as these are late additions. My personal opinion is that it is not that hard for a advanced practitioner to experience these. 

You have to keep the five precepts constantly in your mind. After while it becomes second nature to you. 

What is the Theravada position to following question? Is there a time difference between death and re-birth? Some further reading: Are my future parents already here? $URL$ 

If anger arises while you watching a movie or playing a computer game, it is a good idea that you are aware of your mental state.
