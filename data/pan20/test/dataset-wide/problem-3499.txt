In the steady state by definition the growth rate of capital is equal to the growth rate of technology (gA) plus the growth rate of labor force (gN). In the steady state, investment (s*F(K/AN)) is equal to depreciation of capital (d), growth rate of technology, and growth rate of labor force so that capital per effective worker (K/AN) is held constant. Since you're asking the overall level of capital it will be increasing at the same growth rate of technology plus the growth rate of labor force. In steady state: s*F(K/AN) = ((gA + gN + d)K)/AN. The depreciation (d) will offset everything but the growth of labor and technology. 

There is no one general standardized formula for the value of a car. That is not how prices work. The price of a used car is going to depend on what other people are willing to pay for it, not some depreciation formula that you can just plug numbers into. This inherently means there is some uncertainty in trying to determine the value of a used car. With that said there are resources out there to approximate what people generally are able to buy/sell a used car for such as the Kelley Blue Book which records the average selling price for models of used cars after a certain number of years. These resources should give you an approximation for what a used car could go for but it will never be exact and is location and time dependent. 

For the central bank to decrease the currency supply and raise the value of the Peso they need something to buy up the currency with. They can't simply ask for donations of Pesos, they have to buy pesos using another currency which holds real value. The US dollar is generally the standard when it comes to those types of interactions, in the case of the Argentina the central bank simply didn't have enough dollars to buy pesos decreasing the money supply. The other important point is that if I as an Argentinian citizen know I can exchange my peso for a US dollar at the pegged ratio I will be more confident that the Peso is worth the pegged rate in dollars. If the central bank is unable to exchange my currency at the pegged exchange rate I am unlikely to trust that exchange rate which devalues the Peso below the pegged rate. 

Then add up all of the distances within the matrix to get the total variance. 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 40. Then divide it by the total number of elements within the matrix to get the average variance. Average Variance = 40 / 25 = 1.6. Now divide the average variance by the average income times two. Mean = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)/5 = 15/5 = 3 Mean*2 = 6. Since the gini is equal to: (The average variance for all incomes) / (2 * the mean): Gini = 1.6 / 6 = .2666 Which is what the other users got through more complicated methods. 

Very few to no firms operate under rising marginal costs for all operations. A good example of an instance where rising marginal costs exist, is when building a skyscraper each additional floor costs more to build than the last one. You need to hire a bigger crane, reinforce the lower floors more, install elevators etc. I'm not quite sure what you mean by empirical literature on rising marginal cost? Any good econ textbook would provide examples such as those. What type of literature are you looking for exactly? 

No there is no impact at all. A price ceiling of means that the price cannot go above . Since the equilibrium price is already below the creation of a price ceiling will not effect anything at all. It is called an ineffective ceiling because it is precisely that, ineffective. 

There are three big reasons for this: 1) It takes time for businesses to price inflation in. As a business owner I am unlikely to raise my prices from in year 1 to in year 2 to account for 4% increase in the money supply. Instead I am likely to wait until I can justifiably raise the price to or some other price that makes more sense for marketing. As a result there will be a lag between inflation and the money supply. In the long run I will choose to price money supply into my prices thus driving inflation but on a yearly basis in the short run businesses will not perfectly price in the money supply. 2) Money supply primarily drives inflation in the long term however short term price shocks can significantly affect inflation. For example if the price of oil suddenly drops due to discovery of new shale reserves in the United States that will be reflected in a drop in price levels across the entire country. For any business the cost of production, transportation, etc. has dropped which will be reflected in a drop in the price level (which dictates inflation) despite no change in the money supply. 3) Economic growth drives deflation even if the monetary base stays the same size. If there is economic growth through an increase in efficiency (i.e new technology) then the value of money will go up. If there is in an economy and the only product within the country is 100 widgets which are produced every year with the past year's 100 widgets being consumed then the price of a widget would be . If suddenly a new type of tech allows us to build widgets for half the cost we could now produce 200 widgets in this economy using the same resources and capital stock. With the same you can now buy 200 widgets or per widget. Effectively this means that the price level has gone down and that the value of a dollar has gone up. This happens in the real world through increases in technology and is the driving reason for a long run increase in the monetary base for almost all economies. 

There is a private database: $URL$ which appears to have all bankruptcy filings logged. It has a subscription but appears to offer a free trial. To access public court filings in general which would include bankruptcy filings you'll ned access to PACER which is the government's database for all public court filings although it does require an account and charges a fee for each document ($URL$ In general public bankruptcy filings are likely not going to be offered for free publicly given that it appears there is no official government body which gathers this information. Your best bet to find balance sheets before bankruptcy is to look at a company's 10K or 10Q SEC filings which includes balance sheets and other required data for publicly traded companies to report to the SEC quarterly. 10K reports are the year end reports and 10Q reports are quarterly reports. The SEC has a useful database for these reports called EDGAR where you can look them up: $URL$ Note that the SEC filings only apply to publicly traded companies. Non-publicly traded companies have no requirement to disclose their balance sheets and that information likely isn't available to you. 

I think the purpose of patriotism is to create incentives for actions with positive externalities. Your example of joining the army is a good one. The opportunity cost of joining the army is huge. You are risking your life for a relatively meager salary and are not gaining skills in the workplace which you could outside of the army. There is however a very strong positive externality of having a large army with willing participants. Patriotism creates an additional incentive for individuals to perform these types of actions which otherwise might not be performed. Actions such as voting, community building, paying taxes, and working in certain industries for lower pay (think ACLU lawyers) are in large part undertaken due to a feeling of community that people within a country feel. This social incentive promotes positive externalities and benefits the society as a whole which is why patriotism is likely such a desirable attribute to be fostered within a country. 

Thus the amount of money spent on the Marshall plan is worth 9.239 times now what it would be in 1950. Thus you can just multiply the amount spent on the Marshall Plan by the dollar value today to get: 

Bubbles occur in every market. Along with the housing bubble in the United States we also faced the "Alpaca bubble" in 2010: $URL$ Over speculation in an unfortunately common phenomena and property due to its need to raise a large amount of upfront capital to construct buildings often faces periods of over speculation followed by a rapid return to fair market value (bubble bursting). 2008 was a particularly bad example of this but by no means the only example of over speculation in the housing market. The examples you mentioned were also due to over speculation in the housing market. I would disagree with your claim that most modern crisis (whatever that means) are due to the housing market as this simply isn't true. 

Your intuition is correct. With 0 savings there could be not only no economic growth but no economic activity assuming depreciation exists. According to the Harrod-Domar model the growth rate of capital per worker is equal to: 

So you are right. It is extremely difficult to prove causality in economics. Using an instrumental variable is a good way to do so. I think you might be a little confused about the difference between "machine learning" and Econometrics. Machine learning works in 2 ways: 1) You have a massive data set with the correct answers already keyed in. You split the data set in 2 into a test and train set, then run programs to create a function to identify the already correct answers given a variety of variables within the train set. You then can use the currently unseen test set to see how accurate the function that the computer has to see how accurate it is. A good example of this is computers figuring out which hand drawn number represents what real number because you can feed in pre-existing data sets. 2) You have no data but a fitness function (a function which defines correctness). You create your own data by having the computer randomly set the function that turns data into the output and then put the many random functions into a situation. After the simulation finishes then you see which functions performed the best and modify all the functions to be more like that. Over thousands or millions of iterations the functions slowly "tune" the functions so that the give the correct answer given the repeated situations. A good example of this would be self driving cars. Some researchers have literally loaded computers up into grand theft auto to allow it to practice. Both cases have very limited applications to economics. In the first scenario you would need to have data sets on thousands of economies over thousands of years all with differing data. We certainly do have plenty of economic data but when you think about it we only have 195 countries to look at and there is only 1 global economy. We also only have around 100 years of good economic data. More over the relationships between variables seem to change. Conventional wisdom used to be the low unemployment led to inflation which doesn't seem to be the case anymore in the U.S. economy. With the second machine learning practice there is no way to simulate the entire world economy accurately enough to test how different policies would impact the world economy due to not strong enough computer power. Econometrics uses instruments because it allows for a natural experiment. You obviously can't just run experiments in the economy to see what happens (ex: What would happen if we dropped the minimum wage to 0 or took away all taxes) because there would be real impacts on people so it's unethical. Instead what economists do is look for places where there is an arbitrary difference between two economies. A good example is when one state raises the minimum wage and another state doesn't. You can now compare the economies between the two states to see whether he state with high minimum wage suddenly has inflation while the low minimum wage state doesn't. This would be an instrumental variable. This allows economists to look at natural experiments and derive causal results from these. The issue with instrumental variables is that you can never be 100% certain that the instrumental variables are unrelated to the dependent variable. In the minimum wage example maybe the state that raised the minimum wage has strong labor unions which has some impact on inflation when the same effect wouldn't be true in the first state. It's the job of an economists to try and do their best to tease out these biases but in reality it's impossible to ever be 100% accurate. So to answer your question "Why use econometrics instead of machine learning" the answer is that machine learning just can't be used most economic applications. It's an huge technology but is not a pancea and still can be wrong. There a great video series which explains what machine learning is and how it works that I'd recommend you watch to understand the subject deeper. 

I put the article through translate and it appears that this is the (translated) section you are talking about: "To achieve this selection of 50 nuggets, the Tech Tour did not scan only the continent, but the whole world. The overall result for Europe is very encouraging since there are 284 companies (including 38 French) , compared to 121 in 2015. They are 181 in China, and 833 in the United States, a country where, nevertheless, injected are five times higher than those irrigating European nuggets." The criteria for a "nugget" seems to be a company valued between with annual growth > 50%. The fact that the U.S. has more of these companies is not surprising. The US economy is equal to that in size of the EU but the tech sector in the US is much more robust. In the US there are 100,000 software and IT companies with less than 500 employees which would put them in this category. US tech makes up 25% of the global marketplace. The fact that there are more US companies that fall into this specific criteria is not surprising. Whether or not this makes the US a better investment is a different question. The number of investable firms has nothing to do with return on investment. If all the European companies grew in value at an average of 10% and the US companies grew at an average of 5% then the European companies would be a better investment in terms of expected value. It may be that the European companies are much riskier and more likely to default which would offset that number. The number of companies that falls into this arbitrary and narrow criteria has nothing to do about the benefit of investing in either in Europe or the US. Investment decisions are based on a multitude of factors. European regulatory risk, political stability, etc. may all be factors to consider when investing in a European company but it's difficult if not impossible to make a blanket statement about the quality of a country's investment opportunities. 

Clearly under this model if the savings rate was 0 the growth rate of capital per worker would be 0. This is because it is assumed that the production function has essentially only two inputs. Labor, and capital. The generic production model that is used with the Cobbs-Douglas model is , where 0 < a < 1. K = the total amount of capital in a country L = total amount of labor in a country. a in this equation is the emphasis that is placed on either labor or capital. Assuming that this function generically holds if K is equal to 0 that would mean that regardless as to the level of capital total output would equal 0. So, because the growth rate of capital per worker is 0 at a 0 savings rate this means that K is a constant and unchanging. This is where depreciation comes in. Assuming that capital goods depreciate over time the capital stock K will over time be getting smaller. Machines break, etc. In the long run capital stock will shrink to 0 meaning there will no longer be any economic activity at all. In essence because savings goes to investment which creates capital, without any level of investment we would eventually run out capital as it depreciates leading to an output of 0.
