I have one more answer. All communistm, anticommunist and others hartreds were not reasons or consequences of each other. They all were consequences of the same common reason. Mass Cruelty The level of inner agression and cruelty in the European society increased during the first half of the XX century. It started by the Britain concentration camps and blockposts in the South Africa. After that - The Great War. Practice of sterilization of socially weak people in "civilized countries". 

I have noticed, that posts here do not use in their argumentation the terminology and thoughts of the theories that attempted to make history more scientific, tried to put a base under it. I mean mainly theories of Arthur Toynbee( theory of civilizations) and Lev Gumilev (ethnogenesis), as these I know more or less, but neither have I met a mention of Jaspers, psychohistorians, or somebody else. Are these theories "outlaws" now? Are out there some people at least interested in the laws of history? 

First off, I think you're looking for popular sanction, not population sanction. Second, 12 out of 13 states would definitely indicate popular sanction. (or, more precisely a majority of the voters of 12 out of 13 statues - or, since Pennsylvania cheated, a majority of the voters in 11 out of 13 states, plus enough of Philadelphia. (Pennsylvania never alerted non-English speaking voters of the vote; they pretty much just declared ratification without actually bothering to issue or count ballots). Remember that in the end, Rhode Island refused to ratify the Constitution until the other states threatened to treat Rhode Island as a foreign power - which would have doomed Rhode Island. Rhode Island was pursuing a populist free money policy that was extreme by any standard. So Rhode Island was irrelevant - your textbook overestimates the importance of Rhode Island. I don't think anyone's calculations included Rhode Island any more than I consider the vote of my pet turtle. That said, the Constitution needed popular sanction - everyone needed to believe that the Constitution represented the government the people chose. One of the things that doomed the Articles of Confederation was the requirement for unanimity; the 13 states couldn't have passed a resolution that there were two digits in 13. By the time of the ratification debate, if New York had advanced the notion that water was wet, the South would have voted that water was in fact both flammable and solid, but never wet. The Articles of Confederation had taught the States that the best strategy was to be the last vote cast and that it was wise to vote against your own interest if by doing so you could extract prices from the other States. I can't call the examples to mind, and I can't find my copy of the book, but Klarman offers some examples of strategic voting that were almost as silly as my example of "water is wet". So the level of popular sanction was set at a majority of the voters in 2/3 of the states. (the Constitution was not submitted to the states, but to the voters, but that is outside the scope of your question.) A majority of the voters in 2/3 of the states was sufficient to ensure that everyone would accept the legitimacy of the resulting government - that's the way "popular sanction" should be interpreted. Best references are Maier's Ratification and Klarman's Coup. The origin of the Constitution is complicated and fully of wonderfuly juicy politics, but it is difficult to distill down to fit within the requirements of a High School Textbook (which is usually the first introduction to a complex subject, but must be written to contain nothing complicated, objectionable or confusing. They are written to be fairy tales to pass the scrutiny of the Texas School Board, an institution respected more for it's ideological purity than academic standards). 

The year in different countries historically started mostly around winter day length minimum, or autumn/spring day/night length equality (Russia had used both). I don't know why the summer maximum was not used. The Egypt year was started by Nile flood. Psychologically I do understand the start at winter minimum (Dec/Jan) the most of all, as it is the point when the day starts to grow. And while our ancestors had not decent lighting, it was maximally important for them. It could be compared to the spring of light importance in the modern Northern Europe (Finland, Iceland, Murmansk in Russia). 

Turmoil at the start of a new sound ethnic - in this case the near future (100-200 years) is very violent - the life is too creative for a normal being, but the most of the people are not normal, so it is OK for them. At the apex of ethnic's existance (War red and white roses in England). - after it the even and creative time of civilization changing later to stagnation comes. At the end of the ethnic existance - the stage of obscuration comes - very long total moral degradation that longs until all resources created by previous stages are consumed. Start of a new ethnic with bad base idea (communism, mazdakizm, yellow sky of justice), about 20-80 years of utmost cruelty and degeneration. The annihilation of the previous ethnos is sure thing - only biological heritage remains, morals are absent). This variant is the worst of all, similar to 1+3 mixed together. During civilization phase it is difficult to provide the necessary structure changes, but people sometimes need them. So, lesser revolutions come. ( French revolutions ). I think, the Egypt revolution is of that sort. But you should make these necessary system changes you need. Or else another revolution will come, and another... And after that you won't have active people. And the 3rd variant will come. 

Although I'm not an expert in the field, it is my understanding that we would not be able to reach much of the Dead Sea Scrolls without modern image processing. (And in the absence of digitization the documents would be available to a far smaller group of scholars). And only recent image processing has revealed the secret of the subject smear, which is a kind of neat insight into Jefferson's thoughts while drafting the Declaration of Independence. Of course we wouldn't know that we had found Richard III without computer facilitated DNA comparision. Computers were used in Bayseian analysis of the Federalist papers to determine authorship. Second source with more details. This was an early effort, so the effort was combined digital/manual; subsequent efforts have used far more digital techniques. This may fit your "super OMG" category. 

In 1460, at the times of the death of Prince Henry, the Navigator, Portuguese mapped African western coast down to the 8 N. The Southern Cross is well seen on this latitude. Really, all stars can be seen between tropics, and the Northern Tropic was reached even earlier. In 1471 they crossed the equator and began to be guided by Crux. And Vasco da Gama's travel started in 1498. Of course, he expected and simply knew he would see the Southern Cross. He counted on it. He was already prepared to use it for navigation. And Europeans had looked at it for more than 40 years already. And the Earth precession couldn't be the reason even if he were the first European to see it. Because he could simply heard about Crux from Arab sailors. And no need to know anything about the precession. And if he didn't heard about Crux, then again no knowledge about precession would hint him about this constellation. These two pieces of knowledge - about existence of Crux and about the precession - are independent for the person that hadn't been in the areas where Crux can be seen. Elementary logic. 

Contrary to popular opinion, the nuclear bombing was not really necessary in order to end the war. Japan was considering surrender from quite some time under some condition linked to the Emperor. But they wished to do so the most honorably possible. One of their hopes was to use diplomatically the USSR against the USA in order to have a better bargaining position. They still had a major army in Mandchoukouo. USA wished an unconditionnal surrender, but they knew that the japanese would surrender to one of these two conditions : 1 - Keeping the Emperor in power and not putting him in trial. 2 - Military invasion by the USSR of the continental part of the japanese territories. Then remember that from the japanese point of view there is few difference between a city destroyed by one bomb or by thousands (americans already got air domination over Japan). Actually, most of the americans chiefs of staff were against the use of nuclear bombs, because they knew it had no real military value in this case. The soviets agreed few monthes before to attack the japanese. So now that you can see that military considerations are at best secondary, let's think about why the bombs have been used. The main objective was both to test the bombs in a real war, and to frighten the soviets. Do not forget that allied forces thought about the "Unthinkable operation". If you want to give a good show of force to the world, you need to do a maximum damage on an undamaged target. Nagasaki and Hiroshima were such nice targets. Bonus point, they were also strategic targets as explained by others answers. The destruction of these cities was military pointless, but it would have been useful in a hypotetically and over-emphasized Japan ground invasion. USA is a democracy, so the bombardments had to be presented as a necessary evil in order to prevent a greater evil. So hitting Tokyo would have been a bad idea, because they needed the political surrender. Note that, not all parts of the USA state or high level military officers would have known about all these elements. So most of the plans quoted in other answers are legitimate. Somes sources : Source 1 Source 2 Opposition of american military Debate sources Source 5 As you will see, the main reason Japan was pursuing the war, was because the americans offered peace terms that was knowingly unacceptable to the japanese. Therefore the responsability of hundreds of thousands of americans dead in a full scale invasion would have lied in Washington. Because an unconditionnal surrender would have mattered more... 

There were no goods in shop in Dec 91. And there were many different kinds in Feb 92. It worked. THAT was a target and it was reached. Quickly. Nomenclature is a party term and existed practically before the revolution of 1917. It meant important party members. Later it meant party members that were sometimes on important positions. As party was not a ruler anymore in 1992, it ceased to be, not appeared. Billionaires appeared before 1992. Only they did not expose themselves. To become oligarchs, they had to get power. It is the common definition of oligarchs - one of few who has power. Yes, in Russia that group consisted mostly of billionaires, but it was later. 

I think that ultimately this question is opinion based, but it is interesting and has already generated one good answer so we should leave it open. I think the premise in the first line is unsupported, "Appealing to the divine is a convenient way of making the subjective, objective." There are a number of ways to answer the question - the best is the test that @Semaphore suggests - a textual artifact indicating that the results of a divination are unacceptable for political reasons. I believe there are multiple examples of that happening. If I recall correctly, the Roman campaign against Hannibal featured several battles that were delayed because the general rejected the augury and sent the augur back for another try. Was that the result of the generals subverting the divine process, or was that the action of a devout general who would not reconcile the augury with the tactical situation. Every divination involves some interpretation, and should always reject interpretations that are at odds with observed reality. Henry IV's quote "Paris is worth a mass" might fit into the category, although he wasn't attempting to influence society through religion, he was abandoning his fidelity in favor of political objectives. But I cannot say for sure that his comment was completely cynical. The Chinese dictum of the "Mandate of Heaven" could be invoked - I'm not a Chinese scholar, but I understand this to be a principle that can only be applied ex post facto - the ruler has the Mandate of Heaven, and the only people who can be shown to not have the Mandate of Heaven are deposed and failed rulers. Is this subversion, or a sincere belief that heaven favors the king? Henry VIII of England, Defender of the Faith, abandoned the Roman Catholic faith because of a contradiction between his duty to his dynasty and his duty to his faith, as interpreted by the political decisions of a religious authority. Was that subversive, or a sincere conversion? Constantine fought under the symbol of the cross, but delayed conversion to Christianity for years. Some claim that was an example of subversion, others insist that it was a sincere conversion but mediated by political realities. There are many who assert that the Salem witch trials were an example of young girls living in an oppressively religious household subverting the numinous for practical reasons. Lord Bragg's recent podcast on the subject seems to argue that Tituba subverted her experience with the supernatural to fit a social narrative, influencing them away from killing her. The conversion of Egypt under Amenhotep and the subsequent recidivism has also been posed as an example. Similar accusations have been levelled against Pope Urban VIII whose condemnation of Galileo may have been based on the will of God or on the good of the church. I've read so many narratives that I've lost track, but the last dozen times I encountered writings on the Delphic Oracle, the narratives have assumed that the utterances of the Oracle were bent to fit political realities. Ultimately all religious leaders act in a nebulous area between faith, pragmatics and inspiration. They make choices that are probably sincere - it would take an act of spectacular arrogance to document ones own heresy.
