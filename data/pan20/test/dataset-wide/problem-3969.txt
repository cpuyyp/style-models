As the title says, I'm trying to find ideals of $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ generated by $n$ elements and no fewer. I suspect $(2^k, 2^{k-1} x, 2^{k-2} x^2, ..., x^k)$ is generated by no fewer than $n=k+1$ elements, but I haven't been able to prove it. I've tried successively replacing single elements in a finite generating set in an attempt to zero out the constant order coefficients of all but one generator, but I'm not able to ensure I've done so while preserving the ideal. If I could do this, an inductive proof would follow immediately. I've also tried to make other examples but none seemed as promising as this one. This one also generalizes the neat example $(2, x)$ (generated by at least 2 elements) which shows explicitly that $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is not a PID. I've searched and found nothing useful. This is problem 3.7 from D.J.H. Garling's A Course in Galois Theory. The chapter itself seems to be a standard introduction to commutative algebra with an eye towards polynomial rings over fields. I hope the question isn't too basic for this site; it's my first post. I've gone through the book and done every problem except for (parts of) around a dozen, including this one. He gives questions that appear to rely on more advanced material than was presented in the text from time to time, so perhaps this question is easy for someone more experienced in algebra, or maybe I'm just missing something. Any help is appreciated! 

Megan, I imagine that what you have in mind is comparisons of $G$-spectra as $G$ varies, not restricting attention just to subgroups of a given $G$ as in the references cited so far. There are some things that hold universally in broad classes of groups and others that are specific to a given group (and its subgroups). You might be interested in ``Global orthogonal spectra'' as studied by Anna Marie Bohmann and, very extensively, Stefan Schwede. See $URL$ $URL$ 

This is addressed to Paul Siegel's answer, which I find misleading, and not just because it is not true that maps that induce the same map on homotopy groups are homotopic. (The famous and open Freyd conjecture asserts that maps of finite spectra that induce the same map on homotopy groups are homotopic, but that is digressive). It is the comments about stable homotopy theory that I find most misleading. Good modern categories of spectra are symmetric monoidal under the smash product, and in such categories $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra as first defined in 1972 are equivalent to commutative monoids (as defined in any symmetric monoidal category). The higher homotopies are then hidden in the definition of the smash product. For purposes of calculation, this is extremely convenient and useful, and there is little point to invoking higher category theory of any sort. For example, people doing serious computations with TMF don't invoke higher category theory. Moreover, higher category theory should not be confused with just the theory of $(\infty,1)$-categories. Those are central to categorical homotopy theory, but higher category theory has many other incarnations. For example, $2$-category theory as developed in Australia is hugely rich and powerful in applications. In the hands of Riehl and Verity it has very important applications even to the theory of $(\infty,1)$ categories, but it is very concretely useful in a slew of other areas, including stable homotopy theory. Moreover, there are quite distinct and quite different theories of $n$-categories, which start with sets and categories at levels $0$ and $1$, and $(\infty,n)$-categories, which can start with simplicial sets and simplicially enriched categories at levels $0$ and $1$ (there are other possible choices). Both 2-category theory and $(\infty,1)$-category are examples where there are lots of applications outside the theory itself, just as is true of ordinary category theory. In addition to the sources others have cited, there is a book ``Towards higher categories'' with articles that discuss various aspects of higher category theory and that may give some idea of the why as well as the wherefore. 

Many of the results you mention form part of the categorical approach to (parts of) Universal Algebra. There is a lot of active research in this area, especially in the study of semi-abelian categories, Malt'sev categories, etc. Although this is not main stream Universal algebra and some universal algebraists may not feel it deserves mention as part of that subject, it may help to look at the book by Bourn and Borceux mentioned in the n-Lab article on semi-abelian categories. 

As always it depends on what you know (i.e. your background) and on what you need. For Galois theory, there is a nice book by Douady and Douady, which looks at it comparing Galois theory with covering space theory etc. Another which has stood the test of time is Ian Stewart's book. For Lie groups and Lie algebras, it can help to see their applications early on, so some of the text books for physicists can be fun to read. They skip some detail but provide the intuition that is sometimes lacking in purely mathematical texts. 

The easiest starting point for equivariant stable homotopy theory is probably the paper with that title in The Handbook of Algebraic Topology, edited by I.M. James. The paper modern foundations for stable homotopy theory in the same volume is one of several possible starting points for spectrum level stuff. 

I wrote and thought I posted an answer a few minutes ago, but it didn't appear. I don't know of any connection between orbifolds and global spectra, so this answer is a digression. Global spectra are one $G$-spectrum for each group in a chosen class, suitably related. Since one wants to start with genuine G-spectra, definitions so far are restricted to subclasses of the class of compact Lie groups. The first such definition was given by Gaunce Lewis and myself (II.8.5 in SLN 1213, 1986). A later definition was given by Greenlees and myself (\S5 in Localization and completion theorems for $MU$-modules, Annals 1997). The cited definitions are quite different (I'm forgetful), and in fact there are quite a few sensible choices for both global Mackey functors and global spectra. Various definitions and examples are sorted out in Anna Marie Bohmann's 2011 Chicago PhD thesis, and more work is in progress. 

The introduction of $Pro(C)$ is in Grothendieck's seminar Bourbaki 195, (1960). There you can see the properties that using pro-objects gives you. This is related to Dylan's two comments above. In the classical case of handling inverse systems (pro-objects) of fin. dim. vector spaces or finite groups, then the limit of the pro-object is compact in a nice way and you can rebuild the inverse system from it. Without the cofiltering condition you do not get that. Likewise, the classical theory of Cech homology naturally gives rise to inverse systems and not just general functors. We thus have a situation in which several important examples / applications lead to such pro-representable functors AND such functors are better behaved.... It therefore looks to be a GOOD THING to restrict attention to pro-representable functors in these contexts. (N.B. I am missing many other situations where a naturally constructed functor is pro-representable.) Another N.B. is that there are other forms of pro-representability involving more general properties than the ones involved in pro-representability per se, but going to absolutely general functors / presheaves, (with no conditions) usually involves other methods. 

What are the units of $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}[x]$? Anything of the form $\pm 1 + 2 x p(x)$ for $p(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ works, and is in fact its own inverse. It's easy to see that any unit must have constant coefficient $\pm 1$ and, if the unit is not constant, it must have highest non-zero coefficient $2$, which lends credence to the above form. I can show that if a unit is its own inverse it must be of this form, but I'm unable to complete the proof. Just in case, I wrote a script to assist me in finding counterexamples to this form and found none. I've also searched and found nothing useful. If my form is correct, then the nontrivial units of $\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$ are precisely those elements with multiplicative order 2. Just since I'm curious, is it more than a coincidence that 2 is the only zero divisor of this ring? That is, is there a characterization of the units of $\mathbb{Z}_m[x]$ (or even a more general structure) which includes this observation as a special case? The $\mathbb{Z}_4$ case is problem 3.10 from D.J.H. Garling's A Course in Galois Theory. I've otherwise completed the book and am now going back through to find answers to the questions I wasn't able to finish. Hints are certainly welcome in addition to solutions. Thanks for any help! 

I have just stumbled on this, so sorry that I did not reply at the time of the question. Some years ago, Tony Bak, Gabriel Minian, Ronnie Brown and myself had serious discussions on this area. We sketched a proof of the connection with Volodin's theory and made some progress, but then Bangor was closed down and I have only recently looked back at this. Our proposed attack was to use ideas from Tony Bak's theory of homotopy for his global actions linked with some ideas from combinatorial group theory and Ronnie's theory of crossed complexes. SOme of our preliminary observations were published in Global Actions, Groupoid Atlases and Applications, Journal of Homotopy and Related Structures, 1(1), 2006, pp.101 - 167. I should stress that our 'proof' was just a sketch and was never completed, nor checked. It also gave a different combinatorial model than their hieroglyphs, but the relations were clearly there beneath the surface. Thus the main part of the Kapranov Saito conjectures would seem still untouched. (I put in for a grant to pursue them but it was refused. I thought that the ideas that the investigations were using were neat and revealed new connections between areas, but apparently I was unable to convince others of this!) 

The diagonal condition was used crucially in Milnor's classical paper. Milnor, John. On spaces having the homotopy type of a CW-complex. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 90 1959 272–280. He gives earlier references to Fox and Serre. In the parametrized generalization, there is a general fiberwise NDR pair characterization of cofibrations that applies (e.g. Lemma 5.2.4 in May and Sigurdsson, Parametrized homotopy theory). 

"Basepoints" of "based" $G$-spaces are required to be $G$-fixed. Conceptually, a "basepoint" in an object $X$ of any category with a terminal object wants to be a map from the terminal object into $X$, and the terminal object in $G$-spaces is the one-point $G$-space. As you have observed, free $G$-spaces can't have such basepoints. Homotopy pullbacks are no problem in the model categories of unbased $G$-spaces or of based $G$-spaces; the latter category excludes free $G$-spaces (which can be reinterpreted there as having disjoint base points.) 

There is considerable use made of, at least, the basic ideas in the theory of Discrete Event Systems. (This is lovely stuff if planning courses as it uses many ideas from abstract algebra and combinatorics, yet is visibly of application to interesting practical problems.) There is work by Gaubert and Mairesse on Tetris models. 

(Just in case the question resulted from a problem set in a category theory course, I have left you to write down ALL the details! In any case, it is a good idea to do so.) 

This will not really be an answer to your explicit question but when I used to teach Kan extensions in category theory courses at Master's level, I used to explore the case in which $A$ and $B$ are groups (which you can take to be finite if you like, and which are, of course, to be considered as groupoids with a single object in the usual 'delooping' way) and $V$ to be the category of sets or of vector spaces. The interpretation of $f:A\to V$ is then a set/vector space with an $A$-action. I leave you to flesh out what the two Kan extensions are, but note the ubiquity if this sort of situation and the insights that it gives you for the general case if you are wanting examples to understand your 'claim' better. I hope that helps.
