For the purposes of this question, lets assume that we are in Edwin Abbott Abbott's Flatland, but the world is a disk, with living shapes Above, and 'dead' shapes Below (the underside of the disk). However, time runs in the opposite direction Below, so if A. Square died on Monday, and went Below (let's assume there a 'strip of paper', like a passage, which he traverses to go from the top of the circular plane, to the underside), and was dead for five days, but was then allowed to return the the world of the living, he would arrive the Wednesday before he died. I'm assuming that time is linear (no parallel universes), and that Cause and Effect operate, but not necessarily in that order. So, for example, A. Square might be able to warn his former living self of his impending death, but would do so knowing it will happen anyway (otherwise his ghost would not be there to give the warning in the first place). The other assumption is that events unobserved by anyone are indeterminate (i.e. a kind of Copenhagen interpretation of time). Can anyone see any logical issues with this? One concern is the travel via the 'strip of paper' connecting the top (Above) world with the Below world - would there be a point where A Square's ghost would be existing both in forward time, and backward time? Could this be done non fatally? incidentally, time Below doesn't involve people walking backwards, and broken glasses reforming; locally, it appears as if time is moving forward, just backwards relative to those Above. I've thought of one issue concerning computation: Imagine a machine which prints either the letter 'A' or 'B'. However, it is rigged to send this printout to its former self, and when the former self receives that printout, it is programmed to choose the opposite. So if it chooses 'A' it tells it's former self this, so it chooses'B', and visa versa. I'd imagine that such a weird 'paradox engine' would be in a suppositional state, like Schroedinger's cat in the box, until some highly improbable failure occurred to break it out of its loop (such as mechanical failure etc.) Would this mean there is a 'virtual' universe where the machine runs thousands of times before the improbable event occurs? I suspect this would mean our universe would occasionally have very improbable things happen due to such temporal feedback loops occurring in nature... The motivation for this is a fantasy story, where I'm trying to devise a mechanism for prophecy based on (as in much folklore) the notion of time working differently in 'fairyland'. 

Radiation is a scary thing, but it's just one example you could use. I don't think scarcity of resources will work out, unless you create some mystery "Resource X" that is A) Scarce and B) needed. Iridium would do nicely if you want to use existing resources. Wikipedia lists Iridium consumption as 10 tonnes in 2010. That's not a whole lot, and if the rockets or the supplies needed it, you'd find Earth significantly lacking it. But again, you run into the issues 

Now, imagine if there was a faulty (by our standards!) theory that had these "magical spirits" that "conduct magic". There are 4 elements to control, and various substances are made of these four elements. Depending on how much of an element it contains, one can control it to a certain degree. Faulty theories ("The sun rotates around the earth") can halt scientific/academic progress for a long time. Add in a world where strange occurrences CAN be explained by magic, and it becomes that much harder to advance technology. Another way to halt scientific progress is if the use of magic strains the mind. If people are constantly mentally tired from doing magic (because by doing magic, a by-product that affects the brain forms in the body), they might not make discoveries as fast. 

I've just discovered this, so apologies for such a long delay! So, some thoughts: 1) information has to be encoded in something (e.g. spirit matter, energy patterns etc.) and its degradation would be, almost by definition, entropy. 2) Hence, would people try to limit the entropy as much as possible, once they worked out that the universe worked in this way? perhaps by encoding a specific memory in multiple ways (so at least one way would survive the trip back). Think, for example, of Thomas Edison's experiments to contact the dead, and Spiritualism as a whole, and some of the Buddhist meditation practices which are about surviving aspects of the afterlife , and so forth. In essence, people will attempt to 'hack' the system and seek a way around the problem. If at any point in time, the physics of 'energy patterns/spirit matter/whatever mechanism' are deduced, then a technology may be derived to minimise entropy, or force some edge-case in the physics which would allow a breaking of the rule... Perhaps. 3) Maybe I missed it in what you said, but if people can come back at any time, can they not come back at a time prior to their forgetting too much? Can they come back as their own re-incarnation, thereby immortalising themselves within a time loop? Could the go back to their living self, and retrieve what they have lost from their living former self? And then keep replenishing their memories? As for effects on religion: 1) prophecy would be big - and done right, more reliable; here's how my religion would do it: A) Supply a message you want to send to the past to a lot of people. B) Kill them all. C) They report to your former selves, but although entropy means they've lost information, they've probably not all lost the same information in the same manner, so each will have a small piece of the message. D) Apply statistical methods to put the fragments together and get some idea of the future. 2) Deceit via prophecy can be done in the same way - just get you're murdered population of death-travellers to tell lies (or lie to them all)... 3) What about temporal edge cases? Can you die/come back at the very edges of Time itself? The start or end of the universe? If you could retrieve any information from such times, you'd have clear stories about how the universe starts and ends. 4) There'll be stories in the myths of people from the 'future' meeting the heroes of the stories. Perhaps advising them etc. 5) Mostly, however, I'm not sure religion will be that different, because it already claims all these things. The only difference may be if there was a scientific means of demonstrating, verifiably, that the universe works this way... And given that we already live in a world where there are consistencies in the stories of people who have Near Death Experiences, where stories (cases) of supposed re-incarnation exists, prophecies etc.. I suspect it'll have the same scepticism we have now, which is kinda interesting, I think... 6) I think it all hinges on getting accurate, concrete factual information out of the dead/re-incarnated by some means. If that can be done, and repeatedly, then there's the scientifically verifiable proof one needs to turn religion into science and fact. Deceit aside, no more doubts about the afterlife, or the origins and end of the universe. Scientists will look for ways to exploit this for time travel, space travel etc. Governments and anyone with resources will try to gain prophecy as a means of power. Religion will die, and be replaced by the Science of the Hereafter. So my answer would be this: If no reliable information can be garnered, it'll be identical to what we have now. Otherwise... huge differences, but religion will be dead,replaced by a fascinating new science. Science if what you get when you put religion and magic under the microscope - Consider Newton - he spent more time searching for secret messages in the bible than formulating physics as we now know it. He studied alchemy. All this was because in his time, there wasn't a distinction between magic and science - science was born of magic once you worked out what the rules of the universe really were, and Newton etc. were merely trying to understand how the universe worked (by seeking underlying rules to phenomenon, such as reactions in alchemy, or 'magical' processes, and finding them wanting or verifying an effect which could be studied). Hope that helps! 

Given a planet without any relationship to Earth, what does it mean for the poles to be "north" or "south"? Is it something arbitrary that can be changed? 

Mollweide is an equal area projection so each pixel reperesents the same area as every other pixel (ignoring rounding errors). However the pixels do not represent perfect squares on the surface so your initial attempt to figure out the area of each pixel from the width of the map is where you made a mistake. The correct way to get an 'area per pixel' value for a Mollweide projection, or any other equal area projection is to divide the surface area by the number of pixel. If we assume the planet is a sphere of radius $R_p$, and the image is $2h$ by $h$ and representing an ellipse with semimajor and semiminor axes $a=h$ and $b=\frac h2$ (Mollweide is always twice as wide as it is tall), and let $\tau=2\pi$ for convenience then $$\frac{2\tau R_p^2}{\frac{\tau}{2} ab}=\frac{4 R_p^2}{h\cdot\frac{h}{2}}=\frac{16 R_p^2}{wh}=\frac{16 R_p^2}{2h\cdot h}=\frac{8 R_p^2}{h^2}$$ With $R_p=R_â´²=6371\space\text{km}$ and $h=830$ then $$\frac{8\cdot 6371^2}{830^2}=471.4\space{\text{km}^2}/{\text{px}}$$ And checking with your pixel count gives $$471.4\text{ km}^2/\text{px} \cdot 1082100\text{ px}=510101940\text{ km}^2$$ 

One of the defining traits of a planet according to the IAU is that it be in hydrostatic equilibrium. That means it can't be holding its shape against its own gravity which results in an oblate spheroid with at most fairly minor lumps. If you made a planetary scale structure out of super string unobtanium (Rather than something as squishy and flexible as rock) that was not in hydrostatic equilibrium, it technically wouldn't be a planet. Ring worlds, orbitals, and the like are not planets. Unlike the "clear its neighbourhood" requirement (the thing that got Pluto reclassified), no one really disputes this part of the definition of "planet". The spin rate required to get enough oblateness to be significant to anyone other than scientists, engineers, and the like just isn't going to occur in something that fits the definition of a planet naturally. The collapsing dust cloud forming a star and its planets is only going to have so much angular momentum. It's also going to be subject to some crazy tidal forces (which will slow it down) In theory a torus (doughnut shape) can be in hydrostatic equilibrium if it's spinning fast enough. Even if it could get spinning that fast, and get into the torus shape, it wouldn't be stable in the long term. If it got even slightly out of balance it would tear itself apart. The rough version of this is: No, a planet is (to the tolerances of a ordinary person) spherical by definition. Anything not spherical is not a planet. 

Before I go on, there's something else that needs to be addressed: Why do we reach medieval technology at all? Well, personally, I believe that even with magic, the feudal system will still occur. It is this feudal system that brings the technologies. A landlord may dictate how the land must be farmed; after all, if lands cultivated in manner X are more productive than lands cultivated in manner Y, then perhaps all lands should be cultivated in manner X. Why one would smelt iron and develop tools, I don't know. Perhaps because controlling fire doesn't help with farming land. So some still need tools. 

Academics What could make curious people stop looking? Stigmas, perhaps. But looking at our scientific history... In 1667, there was the idea that there were spirits in substances. They called them Phlogiston. The wikipedia article contains the following excerpt: 

Or more simply put, you need materials to experiment on, tools to experiment with, and scientists to do the actual research and develop the goods. I imagine that any "elite" group of people is very, very, very rich. So a lab and shell companies that buy a truckload of supplies more or less each month are easily set up. But the brainpower, that's a tricky one. Academics is based on peer research. You (for the academics here, I hope I got it right) spend your life working in a field, trying to find out why something works why it does. A lot of time goes into this. You work based on the research of others - others that have researched the things you research before. Academics is a culture based on sharing. This contradicts the culture where an elite group secretly has superior tech. Communication enables sharing. Thus, for this to be viable, you'll have to take away communication. This could work in 1950, but in modern times, I don't think it's viable anymore. Nearly everybody in developed countries carries a camera and a global communication device. 

Sometimes when someone says a map is "small scale", it seems to mean a map shows a small area, but the things are drawn large as a result, and other times it means the things in the map are shown much smaller, allowing for a large area to be shown. 

Whatever magic was used to slow it down without rendering it completely uninhabitable in the first place is the most likely means of speeding it up, without rendering it uninhabitable. The rotational energy of the Earth is on the order of $10^{29}~\mathrm{J}$. Applying that amount of energy in a controlled enough way that all of it goes into speeding up or slowing down the rotation without even a tiny fraction getting turned into something like heat (and melting the entire surface in the process) or being unevenly distributed (potentially tearing the planet apart, although most of it would stay gravitationaly bound together and would reform) is pretty much pure magic. 

It's conceivable that a plant that is able to acquire nutrients and moisture as it grows (rather than from a central root) would be able to just keep growing horizontally until it runs out of space or dies. Vertically it would be constrained by its ability to support itself and to draw water. A daisy in particular doesn't grow to the size of a dinner plate because the complex set of biochemical processes that cause a daisy to grow the way it does and to become a daisy rather than say a water buffalo result in it growing to be daisy sized and then stopping. A simple scaling of a daisy would cause the same square-cube problems as scaling pretty much anything. Doubling the linear dimensions of a daisy would make it 4 times stronger, but 8 times heavier. A dinner plate sized daisy would collapse under its own weight. We could selectively breed daisies to get bigger, but as they did, we'd need to breed them to support their new size. A daisy bred to be dinner plate sized would need to have a radically different structure from a a scaled up daisy (Stem would need to get thicker faster than the other scaling, a tougher woodier composition, restructuring the head to be lighter for its size, etc.)
