If $G$ is a finitely group and $S$ a finite symmetric set of generators, the associated Cayley graph, then $x \mapsto x^{-1}$ gives rise to a geodesic symmetry $i$ at the identity: If $g=s_1^{e_1}\cdots s_k^{e_k}$ with $e_i \in \{\pm 1\}$, then let $i(g):=s_1^{-e_1}\cdots s_k^{-e_k}$.` Translating $i$ via $G$, there is a symmetry at every vertex. For points in the interior of edges, there is likewise a (local) symmetry. This prompts my question: What concepts of locally symmetric Riemannian spaces can be applied to the study of Cayley graphs? 

The answer is no. Consider the family of groups $G_k:=(\mathbf Z_2{}^k)\rtimes \mathbf Z_2$, where the group on the right acts by interchanging the first and second coordinate. Then the commutator subgroup $G_k'$ is generated by $g_k:=((1,1,0,\ldots, 0),0)$, i.e. is of order two. So $G_k$ is non-abelian (of arbitrarily large order), but as little non-abelian as possible. Note that each element in $G_k$ has order dividing 4. Now let $A=\lbrace a_1,\ldots, a_n \rbrace \subseteq G_k$. Then any element in $A^m$ can be written as $a_1^{e_1} \cdots a_n^{e_n} g_k^{e_k}$, where $0\leq e_i \leq 3$ for $i=1,\ldots n$ and $e_k=0,1$. This follows by applying the identity $ab=[a,b]ba$ repeatedly. In particular, $|A^m|$ is bounded by a constant depending on $n$ only, not on $m$. Edit: To be explicit, any two elements in $G_k$ will generate a subgroup of order at most 32, so $(n,m)=(2,31)$ is one counter-example. 

First of all, can you be more precise in your question? You are asking about boundary conditions at infinity, and this might make sense, but... for what purpose? do you need a set of conditions that imply existence and uniqueness of a global solution? or, do you need to classify solutions of the standard Cauchy problem (with data at t=0) according to their behaviour at infinity? Anyway, there are a couple general tools that might help you at least to clarify what you are looking for exactly: 1) If you need a tool to classify solutions according to their behaviour at infinity, then scattering theory (mentioned by Willie in his comment) might be helpful. However, its main purpose is to compare two different equations, i.e., use the solutions of a simpler equation to classify the solutions of a 'more difficult' equation. So I do not think this is what you actually need. 2) If you need to understand what might be reasonable 'data at infinity' for a Cauchy problem, then the Kelvin transform might be of use. This is a space-time change of coordinates that transforms a wave equation into a wave equation, and exchanges infinity with t=0. Playing with it might give you some insight into what kind of conditions you might impose at infinity on your solution. There is also a much more sofisticated transform with a similar effect, the Penrose transform, but this might be overkill in your case. 

Let $q=p^e$ be a prime power and $\mathbb F_q$ the finite field with $q$ elements. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$ and let $\varphi: SL_2(\mathbb F_q) \to GL_n(k)$ be a representation. Is it true that $\varphi$ maps a diagonal matrix $D$ to a matrix $\varphi(D)$ which can be diagonalized over $k$? (The question in the title more or less boils down to this question.) Background: Since $\mathbb F_q$ is finite, $\varphi$ can be described by a polynomial map $f$ which is defined over $k$. Then $f$ induces a map $SL_2({\bar k}) \to GL_n({\bar k})$, where $\bar k$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. Suppose that the induced map actually is a morphism of algebraic groups. As the diagonal matrices are in particular a $k-$split torus and the map is defined over $k$, the image again will be a $k-$split torus, from which the claim would follow. But to all appearances the induced map will not be a group homomorphism, so I might as well have asked about the smallest counterexample... 

PM Cohn's "Skew fields: Theory of general divison rings", CUP 1995 should prove a valuable reference. In particular, Proposition 2.3.5 states that for each field $k$ there is a skew field $D$ whose centre is $k$ and such that $D$ is infinite-dimensional over $k$. 

For a problem I'm working on, I need the following implication. $A,B$ are two closed densely defined operators on a Hilbert space $H$. I'll be a bit vague about the setting, add assumptions at will as necessary (the operators $A,B$ can be quite nice but unfortunately not selfadjoint). Is it true that $$ |(Av,Bv)|\le c \|v\|^2 \quad\forall v\in D \qquad\text{implies}\qquad |(A^*v,B^*v)|\le c' \|v\|^2 \quad\forall v\in D' $$ (where $D,D'$ are some suitable dense subspaces)? If $A=B$, or if $A^*$ and $B$ commute in a suitable sense, or more generally if the commutator $[A^*,B]$ is densely defined and bounded then the statement seems true. Do you see any way to relax these conditions? 

To my taste, the cleanest approach to the extension problem is contained in Stein's 1970 book "Singular integrals and differentiability properties of functions". For a bounded open set with Lipschitz boundary, he constructs a 'universal' extension operator which, when applied to a $W^{k,p}$ function on the open set, produces a $W^{k,p}$ function on the whole space, with support in a fixed neighbourhood, and suitable bounds on the norm. The method also works if the set is unbounded, provided some uniform bounds at infinity are assumed on the coordinate patches at the boundary. It is not necessary at any step to assume continuity or smoothness up to the boundary. As Pietro mentions in his answer, the extension property is blatantly false if the boundary contains inward cusps, but I understand from your question that your boundary is smooth hence at least Lipschitz. 

The paper Djoković, Dragomir Ž.(1983). Classification of trivectors of an eight-dimensional real vector space, Linear and Multilinear Algebra, 13: 1, 3 — 39 gives a systematic classification of 3-forms over a real vector space of dimension 8, including the classification of 3-forms over a real vector space of dimension 7. Djoković attributes the first classification of 3-forms over a real vector space of dimension 7 (by ad-hoc methods) to Westwick: R. Westwick. Real trivectors of rank seven, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 10 (1981), 183-204. 

As explained by A. Sisto here on p.20 and p.21, "The subgroup generated by $z$ in the Heisenberg group $$〈 x,y,z | [ x,y ] = z, [ x,z ] = [ y,z ] = 1 〉$$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf Z$ and distorted." As $\langle z \rangle$ is the center of the Heisenberg group and hence normal, this gives one example. 

The standard representation of $\mathfrak {so}_n$ has dimension $n$, the adjoint representation has dimension $\frac 1 2 n \cdot (n-1)$ and there are two spin representations of small dimension. But I don't see a way how these, together with trivial representations, should add up to the dimension of $M$, which is $\frac 1 2 n \cdot (n+1)-1$. 

Boundedness for $\lambda=1$ follows from the fact that $\phi(\xi)=\mu(\xi)\xi_j$ is also a test function, $\mu(D)\partial_j f=\phi(D)f$ can be written as the convolution $\widehat \phi * f$, and one can apply Young's inequality for convolutions since $\widehat \phi$ is in the Schwartz class. For different values of $\lambda>0$, the result follows by scaling $x\mapsto \lambda x$. 

Take $s_2=-1/2$, $s_1=-1/2-\delta$, and apply the to-be-disproved estimate to a standard delta sequence $\rho_\epsilon=\epsilon^{-1}\rho(x/\epsilon)$. Since we can take $r=\epsilon$, on the Fourier side the estimate is equivalent to $$ \int\frac{|\widehat{\rho}(\eta)|^2}{\epsilon^{1+2\delta}+|\eta|^{1+2\delta}}d\eta \lesssim \int\frac{|\widehat{\rho}(\eta)|^2}{\epsilon+|\eta|}d\eta $$ which is clearly false as long as $\widehat\rho(0)\neq0$ (the rhs grows like $\log\epsilon$ while the lhs grows like $\epsilon^{-2\delta}$) 

If $v$ is a temperate distribution such that $\Delta v=0$ then the Fourier transform of $v$ must be supported at 0 hence it is a finite combination of derivatives of the Dirac delta, which in the end means that $v$ is a polynomial. Thus if I'm not mistaken the condition $u\in L^p$ for some finite $p$ should guarantee uniqueness. 

The question has been exhaustively answered, I'd like to add a remark. The way I view the Lebesgue integral is: to every positive measurable function you can associate a meaningful integral (i.e. stable by all natural operations and limit procedures), which might be infinite. Now if you have a sign-changing measurable function, you can assign an integral to its positive and its negative part. If one of the two is finite, then you can associate a meaningful integral to that function too. If both are infinite, there are ways to define an integral in some cases, but much less meaningful and stable; some natural operations become impossible to define or unstable in general. I find this a quite natural approach: in most theorems you can replace the assumption 'integrable' with 'whose integral is defined'. Also, it is pretty intuitive that if both areas above and below the $x$-axis are infinite, there is little point in defining the signed area of the whole region. Consider for instance the Fubini theorem (for $L^1$ functions) and its counterpart for positive functions, which we call the Tonelli theorem here in Italy. You can actually merge the two results and just say: if the integral of a measurable $f(x,y)$ is defined, then both iterated integrals are defined and give the same result as the double integral. 

For a prime $p \neq 2$, the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_p \times \mathbb Z/(p-1)$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z_2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. Serre, A course in arithmetic, Theorem II.3.2 (p. 17). Since a field isomorphism $\varphi\colon \mathbb Q_p \to \mathbb Q_r$ will preserve the torsion subgroup of the multiplicative subgroup, this shows that $\mathbb Q_p \not\cong \mathbb Q_r$ whenever $\{p,r\} \neq \{2,3\}$. The remaining case is taken care of by the fact that $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ / $\mathbb {Q}_p ^{\times 2}$ $ \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$ whenever $p \neq 2$, while $\mathbb Q_2^\times$ / $\mathbb Q_2^{\times 2} \cong \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2 \times \mathbb Z/2$, cf. loc. cit., p.18. 

Let $f,g \in \mathbf {C}[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\subseteq \mathbf {C}[x_1, \ldots, x_{n+1}]$ be two polynomials with complex coefficients and suppose that there exists $h_1 \in \mathop{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbf C)$ such that $h_1 \cdot f=g$. Does there exist $h_2 \in \mathop{GL}_n(\mathbf C)$ such that $h_2\cdot f=g$? This is a toy example of a more general question I'm interested in: given a family of representations $\rho_n: \mathop{GL}_n \to \mathop{End}(V_n)$ such that $V_n$ embeds naturally in $V_{n+1}$ (e.g., $V_n=\Lambda^r(\mathbf C^n)$), what can be said about the $\mathop{GL}_{n+1}$-orbits of elements of $V_n$? 

If $g(t,x)$ is bounded smooth and say $g(t,x)\le-1$ on a strip $0\le t\le T$, then one could solve the problem backwards starting from $t=T$ with rough data. By general properties of parabolic equations the solution becomes smooth for $t<T$. Reversing time in the usual direction, you have constructed smooth data at $t=0$ and a solution which becomes rough at $t=T$. This answers in a rather weak sense your question; I guess you are interested in stronger forms of ill-posedness. Probably playing with the previous idea (e.g., repeating at a sequence of times $T_n\to0$ and summing the resulting solutions) it should be possible to produce reasonable data for which no local smooth solution exists, but one should check the details. 

(Too long for a comment, sorry). If $f$ is in $L^1$ then the integral defining the Fourier transform is defined at every point and defines a continuous function vanishing at infinity. Now if the transform also happens to be in $L^1$, the inverse Fourier transform is also a continuous function vanishing at infinity, which coincides a.e. with $f$. Does this answer your question? as to a characterization of the so called Wiener algebra (Fourier transforms of $L^1$ functions) I do not think there is any useful characterization. 

Let $G$ be an adjoint Kac-Moody group over a (sufficiently large) finite field $\mathbf F_q$. By results of Caprace-R'emy, $G$ is simple when its diagram is connected and has indefinite type, i.e. neither spherical nor affine, and finitely presented when the diagram does not contain an edge labelled with $\infty$. In this case, $G$ itself is not amenable as it contains the free product of two root groups $U_\alpha * U_\beta$. Varying the ground field and the diagram then gives a two-parameter family of examples. 

Dixmier gives a complete characterization of ad-locally nilpotent elements of $A=A_1$ in his paper "Sur les algèbres de Weyl", Bulletin de la S. M. F., tome 96 (1968), Theorem 9.1: An element $q \in A_1$ is ad-locally nilpotent iff it belongs to the orbit of the constant coefficient differential operators under the automorphism group of $A_1$. 

It is known that the (global) Bernstein-Sato polynomial is the least common multiple of all local Bernstein-Sato polynomials. In the case at hand, the local polynomials are given by $b_{p,i}(s) = (s+\frac{1}{n_i})\cdots (s+\frac{n_i-1}{n_i}) (s+1)$ (localization at $a_i$) or 1 (localization somewhere else), which gives your desired formula. Experimenting with these polynomials online is possible with Macauley2 at $URL$ For example,
