That last one isn't a terrible idea, but I'm not aware of any creatine side effects except for the tiny tiny minority of people with pre-existing conditions. 

It shouldn't hurt, you're not being a wimp. It took me about 4 months to learn a barbell clean properly, as where one of my friends picked it up in about an hour. It was really demoralizing for me and I learned that in explosive movements you can't really "think" about what you're doing because once you start, the cow's out of the barn so speak. With explosive movements you have to keep doing them until you get the form right, then practice it like crazy to get the muscle memory locked in. The banging of the wrist is probably the most common kettlebell problem, right next to ripped up palms from the friction (use chalk to solve). I can't diagnose your form via this question, but the video I linked shows a more common problem: if you get the bell infront of you too much, it has to rotate around a lot at the top and smacks the crap out of you. If you keep it close to your body and time the rotation of the bar (in your grip) with the pause at the top (when the bell sort of stops mid air), you're golden. This is actually really similar to a barbell clean, where you really want to put the weight into the right spot mid air, then get your body around it. If the bar (or bell) gets too far out in front or behind you, it's going to get nasty. 

If I understand your question correctly, we'll follow the amino acids all the way into making your glutes nice and beautiful (protein used for construction of tissue). Those amino acids can still be "offered up" as calories via catabolic action. The amino acids are released into the blood and form keto acids, which in turn can be transformed to glucose via your liver. I'm simplifying, but in that case the amino acids went into your tissue, then because your body wanted them for fuel it removed them, processed them through the liver, and turned them into glucose. This is a very expensive way to make glucose: energy was required for every step of that chain and you just barely came out positive. This is closely related to a ketogenic diet, whereby cellular energy derives from fat instead of carbohydrates. 

Basically you could do weighted (on your ankle) bird dogs or the glute ham device. The barbell glute bridge is far-and-away superior to both of those for glute development. It's not that uncomfortable once you get it figured out. 

I don't think it will harm your body at all, especially since the other answer seems to be "stop exercising so often". Dave Liepmann's answer is correct in that ratios matter because they mimic the strength of the human body in different dimensions. Your glutes are a lot larger than your shoulders, and your hamstrings are a lot more powerful than your biceps: unless there's an injury or something special going on, you should be much more powerful in certain activities than others. I would get good with your 36kg. It's not optimal, but it's much better than not doing anything. Also, consider adding the clean, power clean, and frontlift. They will require less weight than a back squat (certainly less than a deadlift), and although not listed out in 5x5 are awesome exercises in their own right and will make good use of your weight limitations. If you do cleans, be sure to dial in your form and watch a lot of videos (and record yourself). Cleans are generally avoided by most lifters because they're technical in nature and take some (or a lot) of practice to get right. 

From my personal experience, you can do all the exercises you want, if you do not eliminate the base cause, it won't help. I was experiencing RSI problems while doing lots and varied exercises, including forearm specific. For me this meant investing in a few things: 

A lot of development will come from just working with progressively bigger weights, but if you really want something specific, check this list out. 

Keeping in mind that this experience is from an UNEXPERIENCED runner, let me just say that running barefoot is one of the best things I did for myself :) 

I have an old problem with my knee from mountain biking and I am also terribly bad at running. As a result, running never really worked out for me. My knee would hurt making the whole experience sour. This also applied for treadmills. When I did various martial arts I would run barefoot in the gym during the workouts and I was surprised to see that my knee didn't bother me at all. So I bought myself a pair of those Vibrams and started running outdoors with them. Impressions: 

I'm not sure how you would research this :) You would have to have a group train, for example, only pecs (and no lats) for a long enough time to observe this phenomenon; the duration is problematic, not to mention convincing someone to do it. Then I feel it's also not really 100% ethical since as a researcher in the field you would probably be aware that intentionally creating a strength imbalance increases the risk of injury. As far as less scientific evidence, I've seen a lot of talk about this problem of having much stronger pecs than lats for example, so I feel that this invalidates the theory, since it describes a completely opposite situation (that of unwanted strength imbalance) as being very prevalent. I am presenting this as anecdotal, but I am fairly certain that there is some medical and scientific work to support this. Finally, I think that what applies at their level (Arnold etc.) is not necessarily applicable for the general population. When you are Arnold's size (I'm of course thinking of him during the years in which he was competing), there are probably tons of little details like this that you can observe, because you've already grown so much and are now trying to push your body even more. Finally, I feel like this doesn't really answer your question and I'm sorry for that, but I guess that what I am trying to say it that I'm not sure if it can be answered :) I hope at the very least that my answer can be a good start for more discussion. 

I think research is inconclusive on this matter, I don't believe there has been consistent scientific proof that HFCS is as bad as it was blamed to be recently. Aspartame is also similar. While generally seen as "bad", research seems to suggest otherwise. I personally avoid it, just to be safe. On a personal level, I think that as long as you have a fairly healthy diet (without too much "processed" food in it), you should be perfectly safe from these sweeteners whether or not they're "the devil". If you are, on the other hand, eating a lot of processed stuff, sweeteners are probably not the main issue with that type of diet. 

A lot of workplace cultural norms are there only because they haven't been challenged yet. Things like standing desks, moving around a bit during meetings in a non-disruptive way, and taking a walk around the building are easy to implement. You could re-ask the question as what can someone do who sits down in meetings for two hours a day? The answer is basically the same: focus on the remaining time and try to make those two hours be the worst, not the norm. 

Muscle growth is localized, in that if you just exercised your arms only your arms would have increased muscle mass and strength. But fat loss is across your body. As such the most effective way at reducing body fat, wherever it is, is via proper nutrition. If you can find it, I would recommend watching a movie called Fed Up that recently came out. It does a decent job of explaining the fat storage mechanisms going on in your body, and the largest culprit to obesity (refined sugars in nearly every aspect of a "modern" diet). 

The only scientific evidence I found on their site consists of a non applicable study done on rats talking about a barely-evident increase in fat metabolism due to increased blood flow. The study was looking at the muscles of arterioles, and the quack-product technoshape marketers then extrapolated out to say that it works the same in your abdomen. Even if that was true by any significant margin, you're able to increase blood flow to your abdomen by nearly any exercise. The product is a gimmick. If you want to be strong and lean look to nutrition and strength training. 

Most folks doing heavy shrugs use barbells; dumbbells simply don't have enough weight. It's in EXRX's index. EXRX also has a great list of common errors during the shrug you may want to read about, particularly the "rolling" motion that people tend to do. Not that you asked, but personally I don't find much use for them. If you're deadlifting, rowing, doing barbell presses, and cleans (a typical compound week) you'll be beating the tar out of your shoulders and upper back anyway. 

And then here's this from the June 2013 Journal of Exercise Physiology (VL being vastus lateralis, a.k.a. quads): 

I read Thinking, Fast and Slow last year and it touched on several things you seem to be experiencing. The author is Nobel Prize winning psychologist, and the book is thorough in its citing of studies and empirical data. Fundamentally it came down to the fact that your brain only has so much energy. Pain tolerance draws from the same pool as self discipline and complex (slow) thought. And by "same pool" the evidence suggests it's not some nebulous concept but rather directly linked to sugars and components that make up neuro transmitters. Quoting directly from the text: 

There are others such as getting ice baths and massage therapy, but do what is most suitable for your context. You can read/find more here and here Happy recoveries!! :) 

I believe that more than anything hair loss is due to genetic predisposition. Whether you are doing body building avidly or not...if you are supposed to lose hair, you will. 

I recommend HIIT based strength training, maybe 3-4 days a week. This way, you get in enough cardio (as you work until fatigue) and enough weight training to build endurance, strength and size (everyone wants more size). Here is a Busy Man's Total Body Workout from Men's Fitness Here is a 3 Circuit Routine (personal favourite) I would recommend you subscribe to Men's Health and Men's Fitness and regularly checkout routines at the respective places to keep it fresh. Happy Hunting. 

Stretch: After a tough workout, consider gentle stretching. This is a simple and fast way to help your muscles recover. Replace Fluids: You lose a lot of fluid during exercise and ideally, you should be replacing it during exercise, but filling up after exercise is an easy way to boost your recovery. Eat Properly: After depleting your energy stores with exercise, you need to refuel if you expect your body to recover, repair tissues, get stronger and be ready for the next challenge. Rest: Time is one of the best ways to recover (or heal) from just about any illness or injury and this also works after a hard workout. Avoid Overtraining: One simple way to recovery faster is by designing a smart workout routine in the first place. 

There are a number of schools of thoughts surrounding the concept of when to eat (before or after) a workout, and worse, when the workout is in the morning fresh from under the linen. Some 'weight-loss gurus' say it is best to not eat anything, as whatever you may eat before the workout, will be what is burned and not the fat that is already present in the body. So if weight-loss is your aim, then that is recommended, though, it is not so black and white and you are starved for energy at the time you wake up and will need some amount of fuel to support you during the workout. Another school of thought says eat, but moderate the amounts according to the amount of time that will pass before you start the workout. Large meals Eat these at least three to four hours before exercising. Small meals Eat these two to three hours before exercising. Small snacks. Eat these an hour before exercising. Still others say, eat a snack to get started and intermittently top up during the workout with juice and bread and peanut butter, just enough to keep you going. At the end of the day though, not every and anything will work for everyone. If it is that you are weak when you are lifting, then explore the option of pre-fueling. Otherwise, you might be just fine as you are. Further Reading: $URL$ $URL$
