Our club's empirical threshold is 30% of you body weight. Which simply means, that if your pack is heavier than that and you don't have much experience, you should strongly consider either removing some unnecessary items or choosing a shorter trip (so you can carry less food). Of course this varies wildly and body weight is just one of the variables, along with strengths/fitness/endurance, skll, motivation, age, sex (girls are stronger in %), backpack quality, ... In our trips you sometimes have to carry food for about 2 weeks (and all the technical and camping gear), so this 30% guideline is somtimes violated. And our fathers, when things were much heavier, used to carry as much as 50% of their weight. And sherpas routinely carry up to 100%. Backpacks do damage you health, if they are more then your personal limit. So it's wise to increase it slowly (starting from shorter/easier trips). Note, that heavy backpack needs some skill to put it on right, otherwise you can damage your back before even walking out of the door. Regardless of the limits, if you can make you pack lighter without jeopardizing safety, do it. Poetically, if you pack is 100 g heavier than your friend's, after you come to a camp after a day hike he starts to relax and you first have to run with a 10 kg bucket of water for 5 minutes. 

(origin: commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corda_alpinismo.jpg) This is a "last resort" type method, because it is quite hard on your body on inclined slopes and simply painful on verticals. But it works and you can even use a prusik to back it up. Because the rope presses hard on your leg and eats up your clothes by friction, people started to add more fabric to their pants at the main friction point. Then they started to sew metallic parts to their pants. Then they realized that they didn't need pants if they had metallic parts. This way the first belay devices were born. 

Small area of small fires (grass) - if you act fast, you can put it out faster than it's spreading Big area of small fires (grass) - you can't put out all the fire, but you can try to limit its spread. Follow Kate's advice on effective control. Make sure you do not get surrounded by fire while you are fighting. Any area of big flames (trees/bushes) - escape, save people, forget the forest. Developed crown fires travel rapidly, faster than you run, so be safe before it gets developed. 

There is at least one option from Ferrino, but I am sure there are more from "mountain" brands. Maybe you should stop looking for "4 season" and start looking for extreme/mountaineering/alpinism solutions, because high mountain expeditions usually imply low temperatures and high winds. But make sure you the tent is not an "emergency" tent. However you are right, sleeping in a 1-person tent in winter is not recommended at all, at least if you have relatively little experience in winter camping. In e.g. -10 or -20 C it is still cold when you sleep tightly packed with your friends, and it is much worse when you are alone. And if you make a mistake letting yourself to get too cold, there may be no one around to help you. So in winter people in my area tend to travel in relatively big groups and (if possible) to have a log stove inside their tent, which is obviously impossible with a small tent (please don't take this as an advice to burn any kind of stove inside you tent, it is always very risky). If you still want to try, then there are some key points that you will want to check when shopping for your tent: 

There is no or just little wood above the flames. This reduces smoke a lot. Also the construction allows from loads of fresh air flowing in from the bottom of the flame. The fire burns from thin to thick, top to bottom. Less maintenance. Sure, this takes some time to build and collect the wood for it. However, you don't need to take care of it during the night very much. Means more sleep for you as well as longer sleep periods. Hot ashes and coals will not be wasted, but start to burn/dry the wood under the actual flame. This way you can even use quite wet wood for the base. Safe: This fire is relatively save. This means: Most of the time the burning ashes and flame won't touch the ground and heat it up. 

A lot of good and correct things have been said here. However I want to add something: When I used to sleep in a tent, I took a UCO candle lantern ($URL$ to give me light, but also heat. It works similar to the hot stone, but is much more safe and easy to operate. If the tent is good enough, this small and quite safe to use, lantern, will heat up your tent quite quickly. In general you can also say: The smaller the tent, the more warm it will get. 

A variation of this, suitable for an a-frame shelter would be a long-log fire. However without the correct tools (aka a good and long saw and dead trees with a diameter of at least 40cm) this is an impractical fire and takes quite some time to build. 

A fire in combination with a reflector in front or even inside your shelter is a really good way to get a lot of warmth. As for the type of fire: It really depends on your type of shelter, but the so called top-down fire is the one I can really recommend. If done right, this will warm you while building it :) and once lit, will provide you with around 6-8 hrs of warm fire without the need to care a lot about the fire and without too much smoke. The key concept about this fire is to use thick wood (at around 15-20 cm in diameter) for the base. Use 4-6 of these and lay them down parallel to each other. Upon this base, put a little sand/dirt. Just enough to cover the space between the logs. Put the next layer on top in a 90 deg angle, while using slightly smaller wood. Repeat this, until you have 5-7 layers. On top of this yenga-pile, create a normal fire and feed it until the first layer of thicker wood burns as well. The time this fire burns is determined by a few factors: Type, thickness and humidity of the wood used. And obviously on the number of layers, amongst other factors. Now what's so special and cool about this? 

The range mostly depends on the power of your radio. 500 mW is OK, 5 W is much better. You should study what frequency ranges and what maximum power are allowed in your country for public, and go for the max power. Ranges may include FRS, GMRS, LPD, PMR. E.g. in Russia FRS is prohibited and LPD is allowed, while e.g. in Kazakhstan it's vice versa (so we are having tough time travelling there for mountain trips). With a 500 mW short-band radio you can expect a couple of kilometers, but your milage may vary. In perfect weather in the mountains with direct visibility and a Midland GXT GMRS radio I've once had a talk over 15 km, which felt unbelievable. But if you hide behind a bend of a slope, 100 meters may be enough to stop all the communication, if there are no good objects nearby that can serve as a mirror for the signal. So I would advise checking your and your firend's routes at home to find open spots where you will have direct visibility and arrange communication sessions on these spots at specified times. 

I use tape medical plaster for labeling tubes: wrap your tube in it and then write over using a pen or permament marker. The plaster just makes the surface less smooth and the writing can't be rubbed of that easily. It's not waterproof, though. The other idea which has just occured to me is to use some sharp object to carve your lables in plastic. So even if the marker paint goes off, you'll be able to read the label. 

In addition to great strategy advice by Kate Gregory and berry120, there are some technical points. Take a deep breath If there is no immediate health/life risk, take a deep breath and think a little. 1-5 minutes of planning beforehead will help you do important things first, and avoid doing unnecessary or dangerous things. At this time, you will decide, if you are calling 911 immediately, if you are fighting or retreating and how to fight most efficiently. Estimate the danger I'm not a fire expert, so the following classification is very rough. 

If I get it right, they are using the idea of hunters, who attached a deer skin (fur outside) to the ski (e.g. like this). It's called "камус" and "Steigfell", and I don't know an English word for it. Just like you can pet your cat in one direction and can't do it in the opposite direction, with Steigfell on you can easily glide in one direction (forward) and if you try to glide backwards, the fur will "bristle up". I never tried it myself, but I know a couple of people who say it really works: you can easily go uphill, without (much) affecting forward gliding performance. When skiing backcountry making your own track on snow, even "climbing" 5-10 degree slops can be very tiresome (or you use a grip wax and sacrifice gliding at all). So having a Steigfell (in your case, integrated) is a huge advantage. But don't expect to be able to walk a 30-deg slope uphill.
