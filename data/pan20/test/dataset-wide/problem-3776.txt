This is my understanding (but I may be missing some hypothesis) of what Buzzard asserts in footnote 2 page 26 (section 4) of its paper Eigenvarieties. (In the situation consider by Buzzard, $Z$ is a closed subvariety of $B \times \bf A^1$ ($\bf A^1$ the rigid affine line) and $Y$ is the subset of $z \in Z$ such that $| pr_2(z) | \leq 1$, where $pr_2: Z \rightarrow \bf A^1$ is the second projection -- but I do not think that helps.) Buzzard attributes the idea to Grosse-Klönne and just says "one can use 9.6.3/3 and 9.5.3/5 of [BGR] to prove that $Y \rightarrow Z$ is both an open and a closed immersion". Here [BGR] is naturally the book Non-Archimedean Analysis by Bosch, Güntzer and Remmert. Unfortunately, I am not able to understand how the results of [BGR] imply the desired assertions. Thanks for anyone who can help me understand this argument. 

Since no one answered my question, I have asked the author of the book. Emmanuel Kowalski told me that this remark they make (namely that the form (1) or (2) they give of Chebotarev can be proved using GRH alone, without Artin) is mistaken. In the state of our knowledge, Artin is necessary to get such a precise form. 

In coordinates $(x,y,z)$, consider { $z \geq 0$} and remove from it the half line { $(t,0,0) | t > 0 $}. You get something non convex, but it seems to me that it also satisfies your property. Maybe you need some boundedness? 

Together with the decimal system, already proposed by Neel Krishnaswami, I would also put binary notation. 

I like this example. Consider a surface $V$ in $(\mathbb{C}^{\ast})²$ given by some Laurent polynomial $p(z)$, then the hyperfurface $X$ defined by $ xy = p(z)$ is Calabi-Yau. Its mirror $\check X$ can be constructed by taking the Newton polygon $\Delta$ of $p$ and then consider the toric variety defined by the cone over $\{ 1 \} \times \Delta$ in $\mathbb{R}³$. $\check X$ is a resolution of this toric variety obtained from some subdivision of $\Delta$. Now, the surface $V$ (the one we started from) has a "tropical amoeba". This can be thought of a graph in $\mathbb{R}²$ which is the limit (in some sense) of the image of $V$ under the standard torus fibration $(\mathbb{C}^{\ast})² \rightarrow \mathbb{R}²$. The interesting thing is that this graph gives a subdivision of $\mathbb{R}²$ which is dual to the subdivision of $\Delta$ (this is related Gil Kalai's answer). More over this graph is also the locus of singular fibres of a Lagrangian torus fibration defined on $X$. Such a Lagrangian fibration induces on the base an affine structure as I said previously. A construction such as the one I described above can be used to construct many Lagrangian $S^3$'s in $X$ over the bounded regions defined by the graph. The mirror of these objects are the divisors $\check X$ corresponding to interior integral points of $\Delta$, or better, line bundles supported on such divisors. There are some interesting correspondences between intersection points of these spheres and cohomology of the line bundles, even without getting into $\mathcal{A}^{\infty}$ constructions. 

This property in question 1 does not hold for many models of ZFC. In particular, if $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are two non-Rudin Keisler equivalent selective ultrafilters, then $P_{\mathcal{U}}\simeq P_{\mathcal{V}}\simeq\{0,1\}$. In particular, under CH or more generally MA, there are $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$ non-Rudin Keisler equivalent ultrafilters on $\omega$. Furthermore, if there are two distinct measurable cardinals, then the normal ultrafilters $\mathcal{U}_{1},\mathcal{U}_{2}$ on those measurable cardinals are not Rudin Keisler equivalent, but $P_{\mathcal{U}_{1}}\simeq P_{\mathcal{U}_{2}}\simeq\{0,1\}$. 

$\textbf{A counterexample when $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ is regular}$. This holds if $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ is a regular cardinal. In fact, it holds for any regular cardinal. If $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal, then the ideal of non-stationary sets in $\kappa$ cannot be generated by $\kappa$ many elements. To prove this fact, suppose to the contrary that $(C_{\alpha})_{\alpha<\kappa}$ generates the filter generated by all club sets. Then let $D=\Delta_{\alpha<\kappa}C_{\alpha}$ be the diagonal intersection. Then $D$ is a club set such that for each club set $C$, we have $D\subseteq C\cup A$ for some bounded $A$. However, if $E$ is the collection of limit points of $D$, then $D\not\subseteq E\cup A$ for each bounded $A\subseteq\kappa$. This is a contradiction. $\textbf{A counterexample that works regardless of the regularity of $2^{\aleph_{0}}$}$. One can modify the above example to get such an ideal even when $2^{\aleph_{0}}$ is not regular. The idea is to take the filter of club sets on $P_{\kappa}(X)$ instead of $\kappa$ and generalize the above argument. Suppose that $\kappa$ is an uncountable cardinal such that $\mathfrak{c}^{<\kappa}=\mathfrak{c}$ (i.e. $\mathfrak{c}^{\lambda}=\mathfrak{c}$ for each $\lambda<\kappa$. For example, we could have $\kappa=\aleph_{1}$. Let $X$ be any set of cardinality continuum. Then define $P_{\kappa}(X)=\{R\subseteq X:|R|<\kappa\}$. Then $|P_{\kappa}(X)|=\mathfrak{c}$. A subset $\mathcal{P}\subseteq P_{\kappa}(X)$ is said to be an unbounded set if for each $P\in P_{\kappa}(X)$ there is some $Q\in X$ with $P\subseteq Q$. We say that $\mathcal{P}\subseteq P_{\kappa}(X)$ is closed if whenever $\lambda<\kappa$ and $P_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{P}$ for $\alpha<\lambda$, then $\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}P_{\alpha}\in\mathcal{P}$. As usual, a set is a club set if it is closed and unbounded. It is easy to show that the intersection of less than $\kappa$ club sets in $P_{\kappa}(X)$ is a club set. If $C_{x}\subseteq P_{\kappa}(X)$ for each $x\in X$, then define the diagonal intersection by letting $R\in\Delta_{x\in X}C_{x}$ iff $R\in P_{\kappa}(X)$ and $R\in C_{x}$ for each $x\in R$. It is easy to show that the diagonal intersection of club sets in $P_{\kappa}(X)$ is a club set in $P_{\kappa}(X)$. The filter generated by the club sets in $P_{\kappa}(X)$ is $\sigma$-complete and even $\kappa$-complete, but I claim that this filter is not generated by continuumly many elements. Suppose for the sake of contradiction, that the filter generated by the club sets in $P_{\kappa}(X)$ is generated by continuumly many elements. Then let $(C_{x})_{x\in X}$ be a system of club sets that generates the filter of club sets. Then let $D=\Delta_{x\in X}C_{x}$. Then $D$ is a club set in $P_{\kappa}(X)$. Define $\uparrow x=\{R\in P_{\kappa}(X)|x\in R\}$. If $C$ is a club set, then $C_{x}\subseteq C$ for some $x\in X$. Therefore if $R\in D,x\in R$, then $R\in C_{x}\subseteq C$. In other words, for each club set $C$ there is an $x\in X$ where $D\cap\uparrow x\subseteq C$. Therefore $\{D\cap\uparrow x|x\in X\}$ generates the club filter. Now assume that $A_{x}\in D\cap\uparrow x$ for each $x\in X$. Let $B_{x}\in P_{\kappa}(X)$ be a set such that $A_{x}\subseteq B_{x}$ but $A_{x}\neq B_{x}$. Let $E\subseteq P_{\kappa}(X)$ be the collection of all subsets $L\in P_{\kappa}(X)$ such that if $x\in L$, then $B_{x}\subseteq L$. Then $E$ is a club set. However, $A_{x}\in D\cap\uparrow x$, but $A_{x}\not\in E$. Therefore $D\cap\uparrow x\not\subseteq E$ for each $x\in X$. This is a contradiction. We conclude that the filter generated by the club sets in $P_{\kappa}(X)$ cannot be generated with continuumly many elements. 

As Daniel Pomerleano recalled, I have done some work on this with Castano-Bernard. The article is posted here $URL$ I can try to summarise the main ideas. Friedman and Tian showed that a set of nodes in X can be smoothed (in the complex category) if the homology classes of exceptional cycles of a resolution satisfy a good relation. Roughly this means that there is a $3$-dimensional chain whose boundary are the exceptional cycles (actually, it's a bit stronger than this...). On the other hand Smith, Thomas and Yau (see reference given by Daniel Pomerleano) have shown that a ``symplectic conifold'' can be resolved (in the symplectic category) if the vanishing cycles (Lagrangian $3$-spheres) satisfy a good relation (i.e. there exists a $4$-chain bounding the spheres). In the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow philosophy of mirror symmetry one should be able to write $X$ as a torus bundle (with some singular fibres...) $E/L \rightarrow B$. Where $B$ is a real $n$-dimensional manifold, $E$ is a $n$-dimensional vector bundle and $L$ is a maximal lattice ($\cong \mathbb{Z}^n$ over a point). The mirror manifold $X'$ is the dual torus bundle $E'/L' \rightarrow B$. Now let $n=3$. If one has a one dimensional vector subspace $V_b \subset E_b$, where $b \in B$, then the anhilator of $V_b$ is a $2$-dimensional subvector space $V'_b \subset E'_b$. If you vary $b$ and $V_b$ over some $2$-dimensional object in $B$ then you obtain a $3$-dimensional object in $X$ and on the mirror you have a $4$-dimensional object. This somehow explains the correspondence between "odd cohomology" in $X$ and ``even cohomology'' in $X'$. In our paper, we construct some $2$-dimensional objects (which we call tropical $2$-cycles) which in $X$ give a $3$-chain whose boundary is the union of the exceptional cycles and in $X'$ give a $4$-chain whose boundary is the union of the vanishing cycles. This proves that if such tropical $2$-cycles exist the obstructions to smoothing $X$ and to resolving $X'$ vanish simultaneously. Our work relies very much on Mark Gross's ``Topological Mirror Symmetry'', which you can find here $URL$ 

There are already some questions with almost the same title, but they are more restrictive. Let $G$ be a finite group, $H$ a subgroup, $V$ an irreducible representation of $H$, and $W=Ind_H^G V$ the induced representation. 

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\mathbb Q$, which does not have complex multiplication over the algebraic closure of $\mathbb Q$. For $x>0$, let $P(x)$ be the number of primes $p < x$ such that $E$ has good super-singular reduction at $p$. The Lang-Trotter's conjecture states that $$P(x) = O (x^{1/2}/\log x).$$ In Serre's paper Quelques applications du théorème de densité de Chebotarev, Serre proves $P(x)=O(x^{3/4})$ under the generalized Riemann hypothesis (GRH) for Artin $L$-functions. 

The standard theory of Galois representations is concerned with the actions of absolute Galois groups of number fields over abelian groups (in particular, vector spaces). Anabelian geometry is about the actions (by outer automorphisms) of the same absolute Galois group over étale fundamental group of varieties which are "very far from abelian" (hence the name "anabelian".) So the two theories seem go in rather opposite directions. To obtain applications of anabelian methods to Galois representation, you therefore have to lose aside much of the "anabelianness". The outer action of the absolute Galois group $G_K$ over the fundamental group $\pi_1(X_{\bar K})$ induces an action on the quotient of $\pi_1$ by any of its characteristic subgroups. If you quotient $\pi_1(X_{\bar K})$ by its derived subgroup, you obtain $H_1(X_{\bar K})$, and basically your are back to the study of the action of Galois groups on the cohomology of varieties -- you have completely lost any anabelian aspect. Instead you can quotient $\pi_1(X_{\bar K})$ by the smallest characteristic subgroup such that the quotient is nilpotent. The resulted quotient, $\pi_1^{nil}$ is a nilpotent group with action of $G_K$, and you can study it. This was done in the case where $X$ is the projective line minus three points (arguably the simplest anabelian curve) by Deligne in his paper "le groups fundamental de la droits projective moins trots points", in the book "Galois groups over $\mathbb Q$", from a conference held in 1987. The group $\pi_1^\nil$ is much more complicated and richer than the abelian $H_1$ (just a free abelian group with two generators in whatever category you want to consider it) but still is nilpotent, so, as Deligne puts it, "far from the anabelian dream of Grothendieck". The reward you get about Galois representations from this work and subsequent papers is a geometric construction of all "good reductions" extensions of Tate representations, which is quite important. I believe that many of those representations can be proved to exist by traditional Galois representations method (involving Galois deformations for instance) but I 'm not sure for all of them, and anyway it is better to have a geometric construction. 

I want to know if scalar multiplication over a finite field of characteristic 2 is generally easier to compute than a linear transformation over a vector space over $F_{2}$. Suppose that $p(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial over $F_{2}$ of degree $n$. Then $F_{2}[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle$ is a finite field of cardinality $2^{n}$. Define an operation $*$ on $\{0,1\}^{n}$ where $$(a_{0},...,a_{n-1})*(b_{0},...,b_{n-1})=(c_{0},...,c_{n-1})$$ precisely when $$(a_{0}+...+a_{n-1}x^{n-1})\cdot(b_{0}+...+b_{n-1}x^{n-1})/\langle p(x)\rangle=c_{0}+...+c_{n-1}x^{n-1}/\langle p(x)\rangle.$$ Let $C_{i,j}:\{0,1\}^{n-1}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{n-1}$ be the mapping defined by $$C_{i,j}(x_{1},...,x_{n})=(x_{1},...,x_{i},...,x_{i}\oplus x_{j},...,x_{n}).$$ In other words, $C_{i,j}$ corresponds to the matrix $A$ with $1$'s along the diagonal, a $1$ in the $(j,i)$-th entry and $0$'s elsewhere ($A\mathbf{x}=C_{i,j}\mathbf{x}$). Each $C_{i,j}$ is an elementary linear transformation and each $C_{i,j}$ is a CNOT gate $(x,y)\mapsto(x,x\oplus y)$. Suppose that $\mathbf{r}=(r_{0},...,r_{n-1}),\mathbf{r}\neq 0$ and $t_{p(x),\mathbf{r}}$ is the least number $m$ such that there are $C_{i_{m},j_{m}},...,C_{i_{1},j_{1}}$ where $(r_{0},...,r_{n-1})*(x_{0},...,x_{n-1})=C_{i_{m},j_{m}}\circ...\circ C_{i_{1},j_{1}}(x_{0},...,x_{n-1})$ whenever $x_{0},...,x_{n-1}\in\{0,1\}$. What are some bounds for the number $t_{p(x),\mathbf{r}}$? 

$\mathbf{Theorem}$ Suppose that $X$ is a $\kappa$-complete space. Then the following are equivalent. 

I must admit that I am not familiar with anyone claiming that lattice theory is central to mathematics or that lattice theory is taking over mathematics. Lattices appear in many branches of mathematics. For instance, if one has a certain kind of object such as a topological space or a group, then one obtains a lattice by taking the collection of all subobjects of that object. For example, the collection of all closed subspaces of a Banach space form a complete lattice, and the collection of all subgroups of a group form a complete lattice as well. Furthermore, if one has a notion of a congruence, then the collection of all congruences form a lattice. It is therefore safe to conclude that lattice occur all over the place in mathematics. That being said, while lattices occur everywhere in mathematics, lattice theory does not seem to be a very popular area of mathematics since for some reason mathematics are not too interested in lattices as algebraic structures. In the remainder of this answer, I will outline some general areas where lattices are used. Lattices play a major role in universal algebra because many algebraic structures in universal algebra are built upon lattices and because one can know a lot about algebraic structures in universal algebra simply by looking at the congruence lattice of an algebra. On the other end of the spectrum, it should be obvious that lattices are useful for studying partially ordered sets that do not necessarily have a lattice structure. At last, one can apply lattice theory to point-free topology. Point-free topology takes the notions from general topology and generalizes them to a setting that does not mention points. A frame is a complete lattice that satisfies the distributive law $x\wedge\bigvee_{i\in I}y_{i}=\bigvee_{i\in I}(x\wedge y_{i}).$ Frames are the central object of study in point-free topology since the notion of a frame generalizes the notion of the lattice of open sets of a topological space. The results and proofs in point-free topology are mostly lattice theoretic. While there are few people who research point-free topology, the area of point-free topology is filled with unexplored areas. 

Let me try to add a different point of view on B-fields and mirror symmetry. Ideally in mirror symmetry, given a Calabi-Yau manifold X, you would like to "construct" its mirror X', where the symplectic form on X should give you the complex structure on X'. As already mentioned, classes of symplectic forms have moduli of real dimension $h^{1,1}(X)$ and complex structures on X' have moduli of complex dimension $h^{2,1}(X') = h^{1,1}(X)$. So the kahler class is not enough to determine all complex structures on X'. In the context of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture there is a nice interpretation of the B-field. Suppose X = $T^*B / \Lambda$, where B is a smooth manifold and $\Lambda$ is locally the span over the integers of 1-forms $dy_1$, ..., $dy_n$ (here $y_1$, ..., $y_n$ are coordinates which change with affine transformations from one chart to the other). Then $X$ has a standard symplectic form. We can consider $X'= TB / \Lambda'$, where $\Lambda'$ is the dual lattice. Then X' has a natural complex structure defined as follows. In standard coordinates on TB, given by $(y,x)$ --> $x \partial_y$, the complex coordinates on X' are $z_k = e^{2\pi i(x_k + i y_k)}$, which are well defined due to the nature of the coordinates x and y. But the above complex coordinates can be twisted locally (on a coordinate patch) by $z_k (b) = e^{2\pi i(x_k + b_k + i y_k)}$, where $b = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)$ is some local data. But since on overlaps $U_i \cap U_j$ the coordinates have to match, we must have $b(i) - b(j) \in \Lambda$. It turns out that by putting $b_{ij} = b(i) - b(j)$ on overlaps, we get a cohomology class in $H^{1}(B, \Lambda)$, this is the B-field. The cohomology group $H^{1}(B, \Lambda)$ shoud coincide (in some cases at least) with $H^2(X, R/Z)$, which is what Kevin Lin mentioned. The elliptic curve case (mentioned by Kevin) can be seen from this point of view. This point of view is also called "mirror symmetry without corrections" and it only approximates what happens in compact Calabi-Yaus. I have learned this in papers by Mark Gross (such as "Special lagrangian fibrations II: geometry") or the book "Calabi-Yau manifolds and related geometries" by Gross, Huybrechts and Joyce. I would be interested to know how this interpretation connects to the other ones which have been described. 

Several remarks before answering your questions: (1) Langlands-Tunnell is a result in the other direction: from Galois representation to automorphic forms; it is therefore not relevant. (2) One expects to be able to attach Galois representations only to certain types of Mass forms, those whose component at infinity in algebraic (in the automorphic representation settings) or equivalently, whose eigenvalue for the Laplacian is $1/4$. (3) this Galois representation is expected to take values in Gl${}_2(\mathbb{C})$, hence to have finite image. So you ask: "how does one construct a galois representation from a Maass form?". The answer is: one still doesn't know how to. It's one of the most striking open problem in the Langlands program. There was 25 years ago an announcement that this problem has been essentially solved (with published articles), but it was soon after retracted: see the two references given by Chandan in comments. And for your displayed question about the infinite family, stripped of the reference to Langlands-Tunell and of the "infinite image" condition, the answer is no, as far as I know, 

Yes, both these cases appear. This follows from the Remark, page 92, of my PhD thesis. This is in the unpublished chapter III, devoted to the study of the Shimura variety for U(2,1) (a.k.a Picard modular surface) over $W(k)$, $k$ a field of char $p$, with level structures either spherical or Iwahori at $p$. In this chapter there are more precise results about the different type of abelian varieties that can appear, and in which dimensions. 

One can also construct $P_{\kappa}$-spaces with strong Baire properties using ultraproducts. Recall that an ultrafilter $U$ is $\lambda$-regular if there is some $E\subseteq U$ with $|E|=\lambda$ but where $\bigcap D=\emptyset$ for each infinite $D\subseteq E$. Furthermore, the countably incomplete $\lambda$-good ultrafilters are precisely the ultrafilters where the ultraproducts are always $\lambda$-saturated. $\mathbf{Proposition}$ (Bankston) 

Now define the action of the positive braid monoid $B_{n}^{+}$ on $X^{n}$ to be the unique action such that $(x_{1},...,x_{n})\cdot\sigma_{i}=(x_{1},...,x_{i-1},L(x_{i},x_{i+1}),R(x_{i},x_{i+1}),x_{i+2},...,x_{n})$. Then we say that the algebra $(X,L,R,1)$ is coalescing if whenever $x_{1},...,x_{n}\in X$, there is some positive braid $s$ such that if $(x_{1},...,x_{n})\cdot s=(y_{1},...,y_{n})$, then $y_{i}=1$ for all but at most one $i\in\{1,...,n\}.$ Example: Let $A_{n}$ denote the $n$-th classical Laver table. Then $(A_{n},L,R,2^{n})$ is coalescing where $L,R$ are defined by $L(x,y)=x,R(x,y)=x*y$. Coalescing algebras can also be constructed from various generalizations of the classical Laver tables. Example: Let $X$ be a set and define $L(x,y)=R(x,y)=1$. Then $(X,L,R,1)$ is a trivial coalescing algebra. What are some other examples of coalescing algebras? The motivation behind this question is that the coalescing algebras marginally resemble the algebras of rank-into-rank embedding in the sense that the coalescing algebras maintain somewhat of a notion of a critical point and a composition operation. 

For this question, suppose that there exists a rank-into-rank cardinal. Let $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ be the set of all elementary embeddings $j:V_{\lambda}\rightarrow V_{\lambda}$. Give $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ the operation $*$ defined by $j*k=\bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda}j(k|_{V_{\alpha}}))$. Define $j_{[n]}$ for all $n$ and $j\in\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ inductively by letting $j_{[1]}=j,j_{[n+1]}=j_{[n]}*j$. If $\gamma<\lambda$ is a limit ordinal, then let $\equiv^{\gamma}$ be the congruence on $\mathcal{E}_{\lambda}$ defined by $j\equiv^{\gamma}k$ iff $j(x)\cap V_{\gamma}=k(x)\cap V_{\gamma}$ for each $x\in V_{\gamma}$. Let $A_{n}$ denote the $n$-th classical Laver table. Recall that $A_{n}=(\{1,...,2^{n}\},*)$ where $*$ is defined by
