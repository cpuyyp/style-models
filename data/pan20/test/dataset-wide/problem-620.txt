Self-Energising Cantilever brakes were a Suntour innovation in the early 1990's. The brake arms moved on a spiral or coarsely threaded boss such that the braking force pushed the arm onto the thread in a way that increased the braking force. This was helpful for people with poor grip strength but that the disadvantage that if the rim was damaged the brake tended to lock up on the point of damage - the increased braking force when the brake pad hit the damage fed through the positive feedback system sometimes damaged the bike. Either by spreading the seatstays at the back, bending or breaking the brake mounts, or crushing the damaged rim. That uncontrolled positive feedback could be triggered in other ways, locking up the affected wheel until the bike was stopped and the wheel rotated backwards to clear the fault. 

The ends of the ring often taper, sometimes only one end does. That makes it slightly easier to get a screwdriver under the ring. But doing that often just pushes the ring around. Better to use a pair of pliers to spread the end, then a screwdriver to lift it. It will usually pop off, but the plier hand can usually block it from flying across the room. I've commonly used the circlip pliers that force something open. They're reasonably well designed for the task although grinding the outer surfaces flat improves things. Even so, I often find that the job really requires three hands - for the pliers, a screwdriver and to catch the ring. Plus another to hold the wheel if you don't have an axle vise. AFAIK there is not easy way to do it - I've seen a number of mechanics who work on these a lot and all of them use either pliers or a screwdriver or both. Practice seems to make it faster rather than easier - they've all ended up chasing the ring around the cog at times. Unless you have a spare pair of those pliers or work in a bike shop I think you're better off buying a proper small screwdriver than the pliers, because small screwdrivers have more uses. 

That looks to me like an overtightened bolt. See how the cable has spread out under the bolt? That means more strands have probably been damaged. The problem is not that one strand has broken, but that more strands will break in short order. So yes, do something about it soon. If you're lucky you'll be able to wind the barrel adjuster on the brake lever in and use the same cable, as anyone lazy enough to leave a cable like that on the bike might well be lazy enough to not wind the adjuster in. But I wouldn't bet on it, and either way it's safer to bin the cable and put a new one on, since you won't have much cable left after the fastening bolt which is not ideal (there's a short, sharp end that's hard to get an end cap on and the cap will be poking out at an annoying angle, or without the cap there's lots of sharp ends on the exposed strands). This also gives you a change to see what the shop you bought from is like with warranty service issues. 

If you want to attach slogans to cyclists it's easier to do it on a T shirt. Critical Mass have a huge range of advocacy shirt designs and places like the Chicago Flyer Exchange have a range of artwork ready for you to use. People will generally pay you for the shirts, so you can use them to fundraise a little as well (cost of a printed shirt is usually a lot less than people expect, so just rounding up to the nearest convenient price usually results in a cheap shirt and a small surplus). 

First thing always is to take it back to that LBS and talk to the manager or owner. At the very least that way you know that they know you're unhappy. Probably they will offer to fix the problem for you (or get one of their mechanics to do it). From working in a bike shop we always took those return/re-repair jobs quite seriously, because one angry ex-customer will tell 100 people but a happy customer might tell 2. Getting them to pay a competitor to fix your bike is harder, especially if you want to take it there yourself and get reimbursed. Generally they will get a better price than you will just because they're another bike shop, so it's better for them to send the job through. Which they will do if they can't do the work themselves. Small shops often do this with stuff like suspension rebuilds that require specialised tools and knowledge. But for a simple wheel install? Unlikely. (edit)But now that it's an axle replacement you might have more luck. This is likely to be tricky anyway, since axles for some older SA hubs aren't made any more (AFAIK), so it might come down to who actually has the part. Your best bet might be to find a shop that does deal with older hubs and get a quote from them. Tell them you're going g back to the first shop, so they don't write "replace type 253a axle in SA 3xHD hub" on the quote (because that would let any monkey buy one on eBay). That way you're just doing work you'd have to do anyway, and you might get the actual repair done free. At the very least you have some idea of how hard it's going to be to do the work and what it will cost, for when you're negotiating with original shop. The question for the shop is whether you be significantly less annoyed if they do this than if they just offer to fix it themselves, and how will that story play out to people you tell it to? Unless you lie you're going to be telling potential customers "they screwed up, and when I took it back they offered to fix it but I wanted to have them pay another shop to fix it and they wouldn't do that". Not something that would put me off using that shop. 

I would try to avoid rim brakes for a low-maintenance commuter bike, because they're not low maintenance. And they don't work very well in the rain. They're also not much cheaper than cheap disk brakes. It's not worth the price difference. In my experience the roller brakes are less effective than disks or drums. The roller brakes don't bite, they're very gradual, and require a lot of force on the lever to lock a wheel. Which sounds desirable, but it means they work quite differently to other brakes. I found that when I had a cheap cable disk on the front and the roller on the back I tended to treat the roller brake as broken, since it didn't seem to work at all with normal braking force. They also need non-obvious maintenance, meaning that when something eventually went wrong I had to take them to the bike shop and wait for the one guy who knew about them to deal with the problem (worn pads). Definitely look at hub gears - the reason your generic "European bike with gears" has hub gears is that they're low maintenance and very tolerant of abuse or neglect. The modern hubs mostly work very well (search this site for copious discussions). It's also much easier to build a fully enclosed chain with a hub gear setup. Which matters a lot in snowy weather. In the other Austr-something-a we get kangaroos and Shimano 8 or 11 speed hubs in a range of city bikes (Gazelle at the high end), and at the bottom end various 3 speed hubs. The three speed ones eventually need a new gear cable every 10 years or so, the 8 and 11 speed ones need cable adjustment and new cables more often. The Rohloff end need new oil every 5000km (no, really, it says so in the manual). It may also be worth looking at a hub dynamo setup. Yes, you pay quite a lot for the privilege of not changing the batteries in your cheap LED lights. But, you never have to worry about changing the batteries in your cheap LED lights. In practice I use both - LED blinkies on the handlebar, helmet and underseat, dyno lights above the front and rear wheels. But I never turn the dyno lights off (there's no real drag when riding), and I sometimes forget the blinkies. Luggage carrying is a balance between weight and bulk, and how much you carry. If you can reduce your load to what will fit on a rack-top bag you only need a lightweight rack and don't have much air resistance (plus the load is centred on the bike). If you want to carry more you could use a basket, but for more people the question becomes: one pannier or two? One is lighter, cheaper, carries a bit less, but is off centre. With two you can balance the weight but you have more carrying capacity so you end up carrying more stuff. It's worth buying expensive, waterproof panniers. Ortleib panniers. There are other, inferior brands, but unless it's an Ortleib or looks very much like one, I wouldn't buy it (just for the record, I'm a customer and don't benefit from any sales). After a couple of years an Ortleib will no longer be airtight, and after 10 it will probably leak a bit. My commuting panniers have quite a few holes at the bottom (but not at the top), and whatever is in the bottom gets wet when it rains. But they're (ahem) 20 years old. My good touring panniers (home-made Ortleib style) are 10 years old and don't leak... but they're huge and I don't use them as often. 

You could build or buy a drogue chute. It need not weigh very much, being less than a square metre of ripstop nylon and a couple of metres of thin cord. It may even be legal to do so, depending on how your country writes the "no sail powered vehicle" laws (or whether such a law exists). I'd be inclined to make it tear away by attaching it to my body with velcro. I've done the opposite, and used a small sunshade/tent door as a sail when I had a strong tail wind and I was going uphill on my touring bike. It worked disturbingly well, in that I had to move the main attachment from my backpack waist belt to the seatpost as it was threatening to catapult me over the handlebars (the bike was quite heavy). As a brake I suggest a cross-style drag chute as they're easy to make and more stable than a round or rectangular chute (rectangles are more controllable but unless you're used to parasailing or kite surfing the learning curve is steep). The main problem I can see is that mountains often have wind, and specifically the wind can vary dramatically over short distances. For example, if you come out round a ridge you may move from still air behind the ridge to compressed wind on the exposed face, and the change in drag from a chute will be dramatic. In that case you have to decide whether you want to drop the chute onto the windscreen of the car that's following you, or slow suddenly in front of it. Either could be embarrassing. 

I suspect you either did not notice a slippery section of the path, or braked too sharply. Have you done the usual tests on a new bike which also allow you to become accustomed to how the bike handles, or were you hoping to gain that knowledge experientially without falling? My suspicion is you are still not comfortable on the bike. When you get on a new bike it's always a good idea to first test the brakes before you move, then once you're moving apply the brakes gently, then more firmly. Then speed up to walking pace and do an emergency stop. Do this somewhere very safe, possibly even in your living room. The goal is to break anything that's going to break easily, and detect problems like improperly fitted or insufficiently tightened cable fasteners. Then move out to an open area and do a series of turns and accellerations of increasing enthusiasm as you gain confidence and skill on the bike. You want this all to be done in a place where an equipment or technique failure will be embarrassing rather than fatal, like a car park or playground. Bike mechanics generally do this for every bike they service, calling it a test ride (excluding bikes that are returned unridden, possibly unrepaired, as they're judged unsafe or unrepairable). When I'm buying a bike or testing for a friend I always take these tests to the point of locking up wheels. If you're not comfortable locking up your front wheel don't do that, bust you definitely should be able to deal easily with a rear wheel lockup under controlled conditions. Test the front brake to the point of lifting the rear wheel. Again, IMO a competant should be able to deal with that situation. And any bike must be able to deal with both of those situations without failing. Not, however, a rear wheel slide-out leading to a highside dismount - that will generally deform the rear wheel. 

That's scary, you shouldn't be able to do that. It sounds as though you can straighten it easily too. If you straddle the front wheel facing backwards can you twist the bars in the fork easily? If so, definitely tighten it up. Firmly. You should not be able to move that! Who put the bike together? If it's new, take it back and talk to the owner of the shop - this is something they should be aware of so they can (re)train whoever assembled/serviced the bike. Of course, if it's a big box shop paying schoolchildren $2/bike to take them out of the box and assemble them they won't care, but you shouldn't be buying bikes from them for exactly that reason. (edit: answer second part of the question) Over-tightening it could break things, yes. But that's normally quite hard to do. If it's a new bike get the shop to do this. If it's your bike it's easy enough to do. For a modern threadless headset there will usually be two allen key bolts to tighten, and the best solution IMO is the Rolls-Royce one* - use a multi-tool with a short handle, so you don't have enough leverage to overtighten it. Do the bolts up firmly, test by trying to twist the handlebars. If you can, do it up a little more firmly. Then stop, because you don't want to strip the stem and there's probably something else wrong. For a quill stem there will be a single hex head bolt going down into the headset (rather than across the top). But the procedure is the same, tighten it firmly and test. In both cases, if that doesn't fix it you should open things up and find out why. But I'll leave that for another question. 

A little bit of variation is normal, yes. If the chain is so loose at the loose point that the chain falls off I'd call that a manufacturing or assembly defect and take the bike back to where you bought it and get them to fix it. In more detail the issue is exactly centering the chainring on the bottom bracket/crank, where normally the chainring is not perfectly round or perfectly centred. You can often tweak this a little by slightly loosening the chainring bolts and using the tiny amount of play between the chainring and spider to get a slightly better fit. Loosen the bolts, rotate the crank to the tightest point, pull on the chain to shift the chainring, repeat. You'll almost certainly not be able to entirely fix the problem, but you will probably be able to reduce it.
