You now have a chance to see the data for the countries he dropped. Mexico's (14) data was notoriously unreliable, and appears to go against the trend. But note that Finland (7) is also dropped where the relationship appears to be even stronger (the numbering seems wrong for the countries). So, this is very odd cherry picking that removes data that both supports and weakens the hypothesis. And it is clear that the relationship still is present even if you include the data which was considered by Keys to be unreliable or not comparable, or where the diets were not considered different enough to include. The 7 countries study was a totally different beast. This was a multicenter prospective long term study which started in 1957: 

Animal experiments suggest that the anti-cancer effect is by inhibition of angiogenesis ( new blood vessel growth ) and induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death), and perhaps like many vegetables, they have a role in cancer prevention. 

Question: Is there a link between pH levels and cancer? Yes, there is. In this review of tumor progression and metastatic dissemination, it is stated: 

Atul Gawande blogged on the results of that trial [3] complaining that the participants lacked adequate training in the use of the checklists, and that there was no independent check on their compliance. The authors deny that these were important aspects. Interestingly, lacking any well controlled double blinded trials in checklists, Gawande has turned to simulation testing in a crisis situation, and here the results favoured checklists. [4] 

There's a case report A case of secondary personality with xenoglossy from 1979 where the Indian woman in question developed a secondary personality which spoke fluent Bengali, a language the family did not speak. However, the fact that the subject worked at a university makes one very suspicious as to what resources she had available to her. So, a single case report from searching PubMed hardly constitutes scientifically confirmed. 

So, there is some experimental evidence to suggest that there is impaired platelet function after consumption of alcohol, and in those who consume it regularly. Platelets are involved in coagulation so bleeding times could be lengthened. 

It remains to be seen whether high dose FO has benefits in people other than those with rheumatoid arthritis, and currently NICE have stopped recommending the consumption of oily fish or FO for cardiovascular disease prevention as there is now insufficient evidence of efficacy. The adverse effects of a diet high in n-6 PUFAs was recently shown in a re-examination of the Sydney Heart Study. 458 men aged 30-59 years with a recent coronary event were asked to reduce saturated fat intake, and to take n-6 PUFAs instead from safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine. The results were 

The above mixture includes oil, so it would act via the second part of this mechanism, but there is nothing in the known physiology to suggest it would be better than a meal. 

Garlic and Cancer: A Critical Review of the Epidemiologic Literature says "Evidence from available studies nevertheless suggests a preventive effect of garlic consumption in stomach and colorectal cancers." Interestingly the commonly consumed western vegetables showed little anti-tumor activity. You can download the paper to read which vegetables did best. Garlic has also been touted in reducing the occurrence of the common cold. A Cochrane review [2] only found 6 studies, of which only 1 study was of sufficient quality to meet their inclusion criteria. Their conclusion:

However, the signal for sexual attraction/excitation has not yet been identified, or should we say published.

Any tissue, being alive, needs energy to sustain intracellular processes. So, having any additional tissue will increase your resting metabolic requirements. In this study, they looked at the differences in resting energy expenditure (REE) in non-obese adults as measured by indirect calorimetry, and correlated this with whole body lean muscle mass LBM). [1] 

as that causes maximal tissue damage. Large shrapnel pieces have the same issue as broken off arrow heads, difficult to locate deep inside tissues, and jagged edges causing even more trauma when removed. 

So, ethylene synthesis occurs in both the fruit and peel, and if there is any in the stem, it's likely irrelevant since the majority of the metabolically active tissue lies elsewhere. In the comments to this answer, it has been questioned as to whether the lack of mention of ethylene synthesis in the stem means that it allows this possibility. As explained in the replies, ethylene is lighter than air, so if there is any production there, it can not affect the fruit of the banana as it will rise upwards. But there's another reference here to how ethylene synthesis occurs [2] which negates the possibility of ethylene synthesis in the stem:

The more interesting question is why high fat meals do this. It was thought that fat caused a leaky gut causing the passage of native bacterial endotoxin across the gut membrane, but experimental studies now suggest that the source of the bacterial endotoxin is actually from the food itself. [2] 

The link between glyphosate and chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) appears to be a medical hypothesis. The underlying process is a tubulointerstitial nephritis, and as well as other groups, appears in otherwise young men. A review of this disease published in April 2014 and concluded: [1] 

Mammals are unable to synthesize short chain polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3, and n-6 fatty acids ) and so these are considered essential fatty acids as they need to be consumed in the diet otherwise deficiency diseases appear. The diet therefore has a combination of these sc-PUFAs present, and historically the ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFAs in the human diet was said to be much lower than in the present USA diet of about 16:1. The effect of those sc-PUFAs in the diet is complex, but generally n-6 are considered pro-inflammatory, and n-3 anti-inflammatory. A number of studies have looked at the effect of n-3 PUFAs on disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, and in this recent study of high dose fish oil (FO) vs low dose in new onset rheumatoid arthritis treated with triple therapy, the FO group did better. FO contains a large amount of long chain or marine n-3 PUFAs.

The claim is made that having regular influenza vaccinations helps one stay free of cancer. However, a search of PubMed reveals no such study to support the assertion. Could influenza viruses cause cancer then? So, preventing their infection would then lower the risk for cancer? However, influenza viruses are not known amongst those known to contribute to cancer: [1] 

One would be mistaken by thinking the name of a condition determines whether the biology has been fully established or not. For instance, Guillain–Barré syndrome, is still known as this, even though the biology is well known. Fibromyalgia is a clearly recognised clinical syndrome for which the pathophysiology is gradually unravelling. Patients start out with normal pain perception, and move to a state of hightened pain perception along with a host of other changes. This may or may not respond to the usual treatment of aerobic exercise and cognitive based therapies, with so far, little good evidence for response to pharmacological agents ( though Naltrexone looks promising ). 

The title of the question asks if most blindness solved by cadaver donation? The World Health Organization states that: 

So, cataracts are responsible for the majority of blindness. Cataracts are readily treated by replacement of the lens of the eye with an artificial intra-ocular lens made of a type of plastic. Cadaveric eyes are only used to provide donor corneas ( transparent front part of the eye) for grafting. The lens of the cadaveric eye is not used. Corneal blindness ( often monocular ) is the second most common cause of blindness, and figures about 1/4 that caused by cataracts [2]

So, it is conceivable that in people with some weakening in intracranial blood vessels eg. an aneurysm, a stroke might result with aneurysm rupture. Alan Wild, a head and neck surgeon and assistant professor of otolaryngology at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, is quoted as saying holding in a sneeze in an unlucky person might: [2] 

I think the answer is really in the physics of the cockroach, or other insect bodies. When the insect dies, rigor mortis sets in. Since the flexor muscles are almost always larger than the extensor muscles, the contraction causes the legs to bend inwards into the crossed position. The bug pulled into a cylindrical shape by rigor is now unstable, and is pulled by gravity to roll over to lie on its back as that's the most stable position, and it is the point where the center of gravity is lowest to the ground. So, the answer is that roaches don't naturally die on their backs, but end up there after death. Death by insecticide may be a different issue. $URL$ 

Your question asked whether the association between levels of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturaed fatty acids (LCω-3PUFA) and prostate cancer could be caused by the prostate cancer patients taking LCω-3PUFA supplements. The study Plasma Phospholipid Fatty Acids and Prostate Cancer Risk in the SELECT Trial [1] was a 427 centre trial which enrolled 35,533 patients without known prostate cancer from 2001-2004 and followed them for a number of years. Those that developed prostate cancer were matched by age-race to controls in the study without prostate cancer. They studied 834 subjects who developed cancer in the first 6 years of the study. They then added other subjects who developed cancer in subsequent years. The blood samples examined were those taken from entry into the study, ie. before the diagnosis of prostate cancer. So, to your question was to whether subjects who developed prostate cancer then took fish oils or ate fish in response to the diagnosis, then the answer to this is no. The difference between the high risk group and low risk was equivalent to eating salmon twice a week. The next question of interest is to whether there are any health benefits at all from swallowing marine sourced LCω-3PUFA but all we can say is regarding cardiovascular health, and here the answer is again no. NICE no longer recommend the consumption of either oily fish, or fish oil supplements to prevent cardiovascular disease based on studies such as this one [2], and a more recent study looking to see if there were cardiovascular benefits with people with already existing peripheral vascular disease also found none. [3] So, it would seem best at present to source your omega-3s from plants such as flaxseeds. And as the message seems to be again, eat whole foods and not supplements. 

The fatty liver leads to loss of response to insulin so that hepatic synthesis of glucose is no longer suppressed, and the higher levels of glucose induce higher levels of pancreatic insulin release. The fatty liver also raises plasma triacylglycerols which in turn are toxic to pancreatic beta cells. The accumulation of triacylglycerols in the pancreas, as well as the circulating high levels cause beta cell dysfunction which then leads to a fall in insulin release, and this allows an even higher rate of hepatic glucose synthesis. The rapid restoration of hepatic sensitivity to insulin following gastric bypass surgery shows that the process is potentially reversible in the early stages before permanent pancreatic beta cell failure occurs. 

The largest prospective study that I am aware of in the EPIC-PANACEA study which has followed over 373,000 men and women over 5 years [1] and recruited subjects between the years 1992 and 2000 in 10 European countries 

Some objects which are not large enough to produce effective compression of blood vessels should also be removed in controlled circumstances. The most complete and detailed account of arrow wounds and treatments is Dr. Joseph Howland Bill’s “Notes on Arrow Wounds,” which is considered the “definitive work on American arrow wounds.” [1] 

The answer seems to be probably yes. Rats were given ethanol to a level consistent with human levels that would cause intoxication [1] 

Your question asks if there are any health benefits from intermittent fasting, preferably on humans vs mice. There is a very old 1957 Spanish study which was re-examined by JB Johnson in 2006 [1] where subjects in a nursing home alternately consumed either 56% or 144% of their daily caloric requirement over 3 years. There was a highly significant difference in the number of days spent in the infirmary with 123 spent by the 60 study subjects and 219 days by the controls. Deaths were twice as high in the controls ( 13 vs 6 ) but this was not significant. A much more modern study from 2011 over 6 months [2] looked at weight loss and metabolic markers on 107 young overweight human females who were either randomized to intermittent energy restriction [IER] (25% on 2 days a week) vs continuous energy restriction [CER], and found:
