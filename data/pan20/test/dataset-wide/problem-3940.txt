In Jech one can find a lower bound for the consistency strength of PFA in terms of large cardinals. I don't have my copy of Jech in front of me at the moment, but as I recall the presentation of this fact goes something like this: 

They also show that $\mathrm{PFA} \rightarrow \mathrm{ISP}(\omega_2)$ (and $\mathrm{SP}(\omega_2)$), so one can read this as saying PFA implies $\omega_2$ is as "compact" as a supercompact, minus the inaccessibility. On the other hand, there are consequences of PFA (including the statement of PFA itself) which seem to say that $\omega_2$ is very much incompact. For instance, consider Rado's Conjecture (RC). RC is the statement: If $T$ is a tree such that every subtree of size $< \omega_2$ can be decomposed into countably many antichains, then so can $T$. It's not hard to see how RC is, in some sense, saying that $\omega_2$ is compact: If we replace $\omega_2$ with a compact cardinal $\kappa$ in the statement of RC, then the statement is true by the "compactness of the language $\mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}$" characterization of $\kappa$. But PFA contradicts RC. Nonetheless, both PFA and RC are usually obtained by proper forcings which collapse a supercompact to $\omega_2$. PFA itself seems to say $\omega_2$ is incompact: Let $\mathbb{P}$ be a proper forcing, and consider the language which has a constant symbol for every element of $\mathbb{P}$, a binary relation symbol (for the relation on $\mathbb{P}$), a unary predicate for each dense subset of $\mathbb{P}$, and a unary predicate which will stand for a generic filter. Consider the theory consisting of the positive diagram of $(\mathbb{P},\leq,p\ (p\in \mathbb{P}), D\ (D \subseteq \mathbb{P}\mbox{ dense}))$ together with formulas saying that $G$ is a filter and $G$ meets every $D$ (a new formula for each $D$). PFA says that any subtheory of size $< \omega_2$ has a model, but there's no filter meeting every dense set in the ground model, so loosely speaking, this theory doesn't have a model (although I suppose there could be a model which adds unnamed elements to each dense subset and has a generic meeting each dense subset at an unnamed condition). My question is: Is there some way to reconcile the fact that PFA seems to simultaneously say that $\omega_2$ has properties strongly indicative of some sort of compactness, and also has properties strongly indicative of some sort of incompactness? 

"Markov Chain Tree Theorem" is what you should look up: it says essentially that the stationary probability of a given state/vertex is given by the sum of the weights of all spanning trees rooted at that vertex. 

This was in fact first noticed explicitly by Biane I think, cf. Theorem 1 in Some properties of crossings and partitions. The idea is that $\sigma$ has genus zero iff you can start from the long cycle $(1\cdots n)$ , multiply it by a series of transpositions to get permutations $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\ldots, \sigma_k=\sigma$ where $\sigma_i$ has one more cycle than $\sigma_{i-1}$. This forces the multiplication by a transposition to cut one cycle of $\sigma_i$ in two each time. From there it is an easy exercise to characterize which permutations one can get and why they correspond indeed to noncrossing partitions. 

It's hard to be absolutely certain of course, but I would say no. The most recent reference I can find mentioning the absence of such a proof is this article by Bessenrodt and Pak (2003). I also got some negative answers from modular form specialists to whom I asked the very same question fairly recently... 

Dear mathematicians, I want to know how much advance there has been in complex dynamics of several variables. I am at present reading Carleson's book on Complex Dynamics on one variables.Curious to know about several variables case.t Specifically,what are the best papers in this area. 

How is Hodge theory of harmonic forms related to maxwell's equations.Atiyah says that Hodge was directly motivated by considerations of maxwell's equations while commenting on donaldson. 

Corona Problem for more than one dimension on polydisk and unit ball is one that has resisted solution but partial results are available . 

I think Complex Algebraic Curves by Frances Clare Kirwan is a great introduction. In the first chapter,she speaks examples of brieskorn sphere. Abel's theorem is treated quite nicely. and much more! 

Sigurdur Helgason in his book "Differential Geometry,Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces" proves various results like geodesic is locally length minimizing,compact group of isometries acting on a manifold of nonpositive curvature have a fixed point and many more without using any variational techniques involving jacobi fields but rather cartan structural equations. 

Consider the tree of finite partial attempts to build a well-ordering, and notice that it has size continuum. More rigorously, let: $$T = \{ f : n \to \omega\ |\ n \in \omega, f \mbox{ injective } \}$$ ordered by extension. This is clearly an $\omega$ branching tree of height $\omega$, and its branches are precisely the injections $\omega \to \omega$. But we're interested in the set of well-orderings of $\omega$. Now, those injections which are bijections give us distinct well-orderings, but perhaps there are too few of them. What about the branches that aren't surjections? We can create distinct well-orderings out of them too: if a branch $b$ is not surjective and $X$ is the set of naturals missed by its range, consider the well-ordering obtained by taking $b$, then concatenating on to its end the numbers in $X$, ordered naturally. So the branches of our tree are in bijection with a set of well-orderings of $\omega$, and there are continuum many branches, so there are continuum many well-orderings. Note that the set of well-orderings we get is not even the set of all well-orderings. In particular every well-ordering we get has order type $\leq \omega + \omega$. 

Your conjecture is correct; as a matter of fact, it is possible to compute these sums $C(\mu):=\sum_\nu\chi_\nu(\mu)$ exactly for any $\mu$: Suppose $\mu$ has $m_i$ parts of length $i$, for $i=1,2,\ldots$. Then $C(\mu)=\prod_{i>0} c_{i,m_i}$, where $c_{i,m_i}$ is the coefficient of $t^{m_i}/({m_i}!)$ in $\exp(t+\frac{1}{2}it^2)$ if $i$ is odd, or in $\exp(\frac{1}{2}it^2)$ if $i$ is even. A first proof can be found in Macdonald's Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials, ex.11 p.122; it relies on symmetric function techniques. A second one is given in Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics Vol. 2, ex. 7.69, and is based on the fact that, from a general character theory result, $C(\mu)$ is the number of square roots of a given permutation of cycle-type $\mu$. 

The formula holds for any finite Coxeter group. A uniform proof can be found in Humphreys' Reflection groups and Coxeter groups, Section 3.15. A case by case proof is sketched in Björner and Brenti's Combinatorics of Coxeter groups, Section 7.1. 

You may be satisfied by some noncommutative Gröbner basis programs: I know of the standalone Bergman and the GAP package GBNP. 

What is the complexity of $C$? By "complexity," I mean in the same sense that the canonical constructible well-order is $\Sigma _1$. How absolute is the definition of $C$? Do $V$, $L$, $V _{\alpha}$, $H _{\alpha}$, $L _{\alpha}$ agree on what $C$ is up to $\alpha$, for arbitrary ordinals (or in the case of $H _{\alpha}$, cardinals) $\alpha$? 

The question you've stated isn't the question in Jech, you've made a minor typo. Here's the actual problem: 

It's not hard to show that for any cardinal $\kappa$, there is no dense linear order without endpoints (DLO) of size greater than $2^{\kappa}$ that has a dense subset of size $\kappa$. But one can show that if $\mu$ is the least cardinal such that $\kappa^{\mu} > \kappa$, then there's a DLO of size $\kappa^{\mu}$ with a dense subset of size $\kappa$, so in particular there's a dense linear order of size greater than $\kappa$ with a dense subset of size $\kappa$. Thus in models of GCH, the answer to the question in the title is "as big as possible." Also from ZFC alone, the case $\kappa = \omega$ also has the answer "as big as possible": just consider $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$. So the question is: Is it consistent that for some $\kappa$, there is no DLO of size $2^{\kappa}$ with a dense subset of size $\kappa$? Apparently the answer's supposed to be "yes," and the relevant notion is that of a "Dedekind number," but searches for "Dedekind number" haven't yielded anything relevant, so if someone could point me to a relevent reference, that'd be great too. 

Classification of symmetric spaces by using classification of simple lie algebras due to cartan is my favourite one!

I am trying to read the proof of torelli theorem by Henrik H.Martens "A new proof of torelli's theorem" Annals of mathematics vol78 no. 1 .The proof seems to me like using mysterious combination of 3 lemmas and techniques .Is there any way to find motivation behind the proof.Although I can understand it line by line, I cannot get how the proof is working.This is the proof given in Raghavan Narasimhan's book on compact riemann surface. 

"Suppose that X is a compact projective manifold equipped with a K¨ahler metric ω. Let L be a holomorphic line bundle In general, there exists a hypersurface H ⊂ X such that X \ H is Stein and L is trivial over X \ H" this is a result demailly states in the paper Singular hermitian metric on positive line bundle .Can this be proved in case of compact riemann surface using elementary methods.
