Scored nearly three times the number of kills as the average British fighter squadron, with one third of the casualty rate (5 percent of pilots were responsible for 12 percent of the total scores of the Battle). The 303 squadron had the best kills to losses ratio among all the units, which took part in the battle. The astounding final count numbers after the war was the claimed 110 confirmed kills, nine probable and six damaged considering that the 303rd entered about halfway through the war which is also confirmed in the UK RAF museum website. No. 303 Squadron was one of the top fighter units in the battle and and the best Hurricane-equipped squadron although the number of Battle of Britain claims was overestimated (as with all fighter units). Credited with 15 percent of German kills. An RAF squadron record for a single day of 14 confirmed kills. Czech Sergeant Josef Frantisek the only non-Pole in the Kościuszko (303) Squadron, was the RAF’s highest scoring ace in the Battle of Britain with 17 victories which made him the Fighter Command's top scoring Battle of Britain pilot during his service period of 28 days. Witold Urbanowicz a top Polish ace who claimed 15 confirmed kills and 1 probable was a member of Squadron 303. 

It is also known that there are several glues in the market containing FDA approved ingredients (polymers of formaldehyde for indirect food contact) which is of use in manufacture of household chopping boards. 

Animal studies firmly support the possibility that depleted uranium is a teratogen. Uranium is known to be a developmental toxicant when orally or subcutaneously provided to mice. 

The protective effects of squatting against constipation are not backed up by clinical data per Dr. Darren Brenner, a gastroenterology specialist. Further when inquired about Squatty Potty's claims by Eric Spitznagel, 

Also there are no real statistics on number of finfish or shellfish killed and the numbers provided are all based on best guesses and estimates based on total weights and extrapolation. 

John Michael Safran an Australian radio personality in a 2004 Australian television series 'John Safran Versus God' had presented Omar Bakri Muhammad a Syrian Salafi Islamist leader with documentation of false crimes against Islam allegedly committed by Rove McManus who is an Australian television variety show host. 

Research referred by Emily Martin in her 1991 paper 'The Egg and the Sperm: How Science Has Constructed a Romance Based on Stereotypical Male Female Roles' show that the sperm and egg are mutually active partners who do interact on more mutual terms. There is a take 2 for the egg and the sperm tale coming up with Richard Cone according to her CV present here. 

TL;DR: Yes the incident (viewer complaints) occurred and is confirmed by a reporter Carlos Correa working in the CW6 television station in San Diego. Jim Patton and Lynda Martin the anchors from CW6 News in the AM were talking about a child who accidentally bought a dollhouse and four pounds of cookies. As soon as Jim Patton said “I love the little girl saying Alexa ordered me a dollhouse”, viewers from San Diego started complaining that their Amazon Echo devices had tried to order doll houses through Alexa the voice service that powers Amazon Echo. Previously, it is also noted through CBS11 televsion station that a 6-year-old Brooke Neitzel had ordered $160 KidKraft Sparkle Mansion dollhouse and four pounds of sugar cookies by the same method. Alexa doesn’t recognize the speaker's specific voice and Stephen Cobb a researcher for IT security firm ESET advises to change the default settings in such voice enabled devices to avoid these kind of occurences. 

Certain food-derived excipients contain food proteins either intentionally or unintentionally as contaminants. 

Fatwa is an Islamic legal declaration or opinion pertaining to a specific issue issued by an expert in Islamic religious law at the request of an individual or judge to resolve an issue where Islamic principles are unclear. 

Per Robabeh Ghergherehchi in 2015, "it is presumed that free T4 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are related to obesity, but the findings are inconsistent." 

About 38% of atheists and agnostics have an annual family income of at least $75,000, compared with 29% of the general public. Those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” line up more closely with the general public on family income levels in USA. The GDP of countries generally correlates negatively with their religiosity, i.e. the wealthier a population is the less religious it is. Statistical studies show that the poorest countries tend to be more religious. Belief in God declines in more developed countries and is concentrated in Europe in countries such as Sweden (64% nonbelievers), Denmark (48%), France (44%) and Germany (42%). In contrast, the incidence of atheism in most sub-Saharan countries is below 1%. Religions may play a more active social, moral and cultural role in those countries. 

A 2013 study found that hormones produced in response to stress can reduce melanocyte stem cells that determine hair color. 

'Coding war games' was an extensive research study that involved 600 developers from 92 companies. The results were that 62% of the best performers said they had an acceptably private workspace and 76% of the worst said people interrupted them needlessly. This explains that, top performers worked for companies that gave them control over space, physical environments and freedom from interruption. Headphones may provide absolute control over the worker's audio-environment and helps him in privatizing his or her public space. However, several other studies provided inconclusive results by which we cannot determine any conclusion regarding the effect of headphone use in office for listening to music on productivity since research shows that under some conditions, music actually improves performance, while in other situations music makes it worse. Negative effects of music during task performance 

Sleeper cells are a real 'potential' terrorist phenomenon as discussed by the FBI and US Senate House subcomittees mentioned below. Sleeper cells are different from clandestine cell structure terrorist networks in that they lie dormant until activated by a prearranged or acceptable sudden signal to perform acts of espionage, sabotage and/or terrorism. 

The explanation for this phenomenon is that in some cases, there are effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on venous return and cardiac output which might cause delayed return of spontaneous circulation. 

Referring to ICNIRP in 2007, "reduction factors are not intended to compensate for gaps in knowledge. In effect, their use as a precautionary measure to account for uncertainty in science has been criticized as inappropriate by standard-setting bodies and health protection agencies." 

Security concerns of using radio frequency identification (RFID) tags in passports are discussed here and Mike Rothman also states "But I'm not aware of RFID implants that have GPS tracking capabilities, so it's not clear that this approach would meet such requirements - unless these "dangerous areas" have RFID readers every 30 feet or so." 

Per Katz LC et.al.'s research in 1994 into whether there is a difference in the amount of gastroesophageal reflux when lying with the right versus the left side down, 'the direct comparison of the two positions demonstrated that the total amount of reflux time was significantly greater with subjects in the right decubitus position than in the left'. Per Khoury RM et.al.'s research in 1999 into influence of spontaneous sleep positions on nighttime recumbent reflux in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, the conclusions were 'the left lateral decubitus position is preferred in patients with nocturnal GER'. 

Per Dr. Diana Deutsch, perceptual and cognitive psychologist at University of California - San Diego, peer reviewed research is yet to be performed. "All of this can be put to experiment, rather than a matter of opinion. People could judge blind pieces in A440 versus A432." Per concluding remarks of Emmanuel Comte's Is 'A' 432 Hz a myth?, "432 Hz is a frequency as another, which does not necessarily have the miraculous properties attributed to it. Its use in the history of music is very minor and its alleged generalization is not, to date, musically or historically demonstrated". The author sees no striking superiority over the use of the reference to 440 Hz established at 1/6th of tone higher. "Replacing it by the 432 Hz would simply be an attempt to replace a convention by another".
