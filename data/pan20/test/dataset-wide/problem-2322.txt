I love my Trango Alpine Equalizer, it equalizes your anchor perfectly every time, it's fast and flawless. Simply clip into your anchor points then pull on the master point to watch everything slip into place. TRANGO ALPINE EQUALIZER 

You'll notice that the boots in the images above are made from one piece of leather. Not only is leather still one of the most durable materials on the market, but having a boot with no seams means there's nowhere for the water to seep in. I know that a lot of companies boast having synthetic waterproof boots, but they're only waterproof for as long as their waterproof coating lasts. As soon as you get some wear on them, in my experience, the waterproofness begins to diminish. The only disadvantage to such boots, is that they are not the boot of choice for super hot weather, they don't breathe exceptionally well so your feet tend to sweat when it gets hot out. You need to pack extra socks and change them more often to regulate moisture inside your boot (I wear marino wool socks year-round, they are literally the only socks I buy). But the pros far outweigh the cons, leather boots are stiffer, more stable, more durable, more waterproof, and last a lot longer. You'll probably spend as much or more money wearing through multiple pairs of synthetic boots in the amount of time it'd take you to wear out one pair of descent leather boots. 

Realistically, if you can manage to carry the food, then you can manage the canisters also. They have been proven to decrease bear encounters and are actually now required in parts of Sierra National Forests, as well as in parts of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, Inyo National Forests and in all of Yosemite National Park [see map]. This means you have to carry them whether or not you think they may be impractical. The only other options are to hang a proper food cache or lock your food in a bear proof locker. Burying your food is not a recommended caching technique. I think you may have just gotten lucky with your previous experiences. One thing you could try if there aren't any trees or bear poles around, is to hang your cache over a cliff or a tall rock. I've done this on several occasions while camping above the tree line. 

Barefoot Shoes Also known as minimalist shoes, the theory behind them is to give you as close to a barefoot feel without actually putting the soft, soft flesh of your terribly urbanized and unadapted soles of your feet at risk of damage. My favourite barefoot shoes are Vibram Five-Fingers, I wear either my Mouri's or my KSO's at the beach. Vibram Five-Fingers 'Signa' watersport shoes: The thin sole will be enough to protect your feet from the lava sand, and it will still feel like running on the beach barefoot, with the exception of your feet getting exfoliated by the sand. They also have running specific five fingers if you're interested. 

You can find grassy mountains in Colorado in the Guanella Pass, but you may find that the air is a bit thinner up there than it is in Scotland: Guanella Pass 

They make a strong sharp sound that will carry quite a ways, and double as a pair of fighting sticks incase you need to go sinawali on something. 

Tip: If you're using a munter hitch as a result of failing to pack necessary gear, or dropping your device, then you can make an old school carabiner braking device, which is what they used to do before dedicated descending devices were developed. You can build a minimalist carabiner braking device with only two carabiners. 

A single strand of 1" tube webbing has a breaking strength of almost 18kN. which is 50% more than the total amount of force any climber will ever be able to generate (12kN), but the safety standard is a breaking strength of at least 100% more than what a human body could generate (24kN). That means a single strand of tube webbing may not be acceptable as an anchor for climbing because it does not meet the minimum breaking strength requirement for a top anchor. But more importantly, it's not redundant. It would be suitable as a rappel anchor, it could hold a fall, but it is not bombproof. A loop of webbing, or two strands sould be the minimum requirement. 

There are many factors to consider when purchasing skis, but for the most part, unless you're an avid skier and recognize the advantages of having one pair of skis over another then it's probably not going to make much of a difference for your first pair. For example, I'm currently riding a pair of light camber 190's 130,95,110mm in the back country. They are excellent on the flat and on the ascent, and they keep me afloat when skinning, but they're a bit fast for my liking when I'm skiing glades, and they're a bit tough to keep my tips up. I know now that I would prefer to ride a shorter ski with more rocker, maybe even full rocker since I mostly ski off-piste. Since I'm going shorter I probably also want to go wider, since I don't want to lose any of the float my longer skis give me when skinning. Until you understand how different styles of skis perform, and where you like to perform, then what type of ski you get is very subjective. The skis you've picked out sound like an excellent choice, and after skiing on them for a while you'll begin to recognize whether they're adequate for what you're doing or whether you need to switch to something else after a couple seasons for whatever advantage you feel you want from your skis. Your first pair will be your benchmark pair, and you'll learn pretty quick to recognize the advantages of other styles of ski. 

Many Trekking Poles have shock absorbers in them which dampen the load to your wrists when they impact the ground: More ergonomic grips, which are often extended: And come with replaceable baskets: 

Is it a matter of personal preference, or are there advantages to using different front-point setups on your crampons specific to what you are climbing? For example, I'm still just getting into ice climbing and I have a pair of DMM Terminator crampons, which can be setup a variety of ways; dual front points, mono point, offset mono and mixed mono. They also come with bolt on heel-spurs, for doing things that I will probably not be doing anytime soon. What are the advantages to these different setups? I understand that mono points are preferred for mixed and dry ice climbing, I can see offset mono points being useful climbing overhanging ice or ice columns, but could someone please list exactly what these different front-point setups were developed for? 

1 Russiapedia. Of Russian origin: Portyanki. Properly tying a portyanki takes a lot of practice, and improperly tying them can result in some serious blisters and foot sores. Learning how to properly and quickly tie a portyanki was the first thing a rookie in the Russian army had to learn at the beginning of his military career. 

Leave No Trace I grew up in a place that was surrounded by open wilderness. There are no, "stay on the trail rules" there. After spending a lot of time in Parks, where there are a lot of rules, and comparing them to growing up in the lawless wilderness, I have to admit that the Parks are a lot prettier. Visiting the wild trails and campgrounds from my youth now is kind of disheartening, because the lack of regulations has basically destroyed the areas compared to how I remember them as a kid. This question really ventures into Leave No Trace ethics. Even if you're not in a Park or forest reserve, the fact that you can go off trail shouldn't serve as an invitation to indiscriminately trample around in the forest. Even the wild animals will make trails and stick to them, that's what most of the trails in the woods back home were; game trails made by elk, bears or mountain sheep. If I'm venturing into untamed forrest, and find a game trail, I'll typically follow it for as long as I can. As a rule of thumb, always stick to the trail, especially in frequented areas. In places where venturing off trail is allowed, try to do your best to minimize your impact on the forrest floor. Back home we had a lot of deadfall in the lodgepole pine forests. So we could actually move through the woods without touching the ground by walking on the fallen logs. Avoid stepping on vegetation, especially soft mossy fragile areas, and look for routes that follow more rocky ground. To answer your question, be responsible and do your best to make sure you're familiar with the rules for the area you're in. If you are in an area where hiking off trail is permissible, please be respectful, minimize your impact on nature while you do, and for the sake of future outdoor enthusiasts; Leave No Trace. 

It's when you're moving quickly and quietly along the trail that you're most likely to encounter a bear in the Rockies, and that's because they're easier to sneak up on that way. I run into more bears when I'm on my mountain bike than when I'm hiking. Large predators use trails as often as people do. If you're not making enough noises to identify yourself as human, then you might not give the wildlife enough notice to get off of the trail ahead of you. While trail running, you're typically concentrating on breathing and don't talk a lot, you're also focused on the trail, so you yourself are often unaware of what's on the trail not far ahead. Most of the time the bears will startle and run off the trail, but if you're cruising along, and round a corner right up behind a grizzly bear, it could act defensively. This is the scenario where you would play dead, the bear might paw at you for a bit, but if you play dead it'll figure it's taught you your lesson and then wander off. Black bears are completely different. If you play dead with them there is a chance they're figure they just scored a free meal and start eating you. With black bears you either have to scare them off, or fight them off. Both scenarios are rare. Best thing to do is to sing while you run alone or shout down the trail occasionally. But it's always advisable to run with a partner, someone you can talk to while you run, and who can help you tag-team intimidate a bear if you encounter one. They sell small cans of bear spray at the till in the markets in the mountain towns. It might be wise to pick one up and run with a water pack to carry it in just to be extra safe, but I can pretty much assure you that 99.9% of the time the bear will wander off to a safe distance. That safe distance is quite a bit shorter in national parks however, bears are quite more accustomed to people there. For the most part you don't need to worry about bears. You may see some, thousands of people do in the Rockies, especially in national parks. Enjoy your runs, just make sure you know what to do in the unlikely event of a dangerous encounter.
