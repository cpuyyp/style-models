Smooth points: good representations (irreducible with central stabilizer) Orbifold singular points: bad representations (irreducible with non-central stabilizer) non-Orbifold singular points: reducible representations 

Remark: I would also be interested in the answer to the same question for other finite groups of Lie type, as well as the even characteristic case. 

As Misha said in the comments, if the dimension of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety is greater than 0, there will be characters with values that are not algebraic numbers. This is clear since traces of words in $G$ generate the coordinate ring of $X(G)$. In particular, let $t_{g_1}$,...,$t_{g_m}$ be a generating set for the coordinate ring, where $t_{g_i}(\chi_\rho)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho(g_i))$. Then the map $T:X(G)\to \mathbb{C}^m$ defined by $\chi_\rho\mapsto (...,t_{g_i}(\chi_\rho),...)$ is an algebraic embedding. In particular, notice that for any $g\in G$ that $t_g(\chi_\rho)=\mathrm{tr}(\rho(g))=\chi_\rho(g)$, and so the image of the characters coincides with the image of the coordinates. And the second statement appears in Thurston's, The geometry and topology of 3-manifolds, Mimeographed lecture notes, Princeton University, 1978 as Proposition 6.7.4 according to Alan Reid's A note on trace-fields of Kleinian groups, Bull. London Math. Soc. 22 (1990), no. 4, 349–352, which is worth reading to see how to get an invariant of the commensurability class from the trace field. As Misha states it is a consequence of Mostow Rigidity. Again as Misha noted in the comments, there is no contradiction between these two statements. The Kleinian group $\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ such that $H^3/\Gamma$ has finite volume, and the trace-field of $\Gamma$ is defined to be the field $\mathbb{Q}(\mathrm{tr}(\gamma)\ |\ \gamma \in \Gamma)$. On the other hand, coordinates in the character variety are coordinates on the full moduli space of (unimodular) representations of $G$. Not every point in the character variety corresponds to a discrete subgroup, let alone a hyperbolic structure. 

Another tool that might be of interest is Proposition 5.8 which gives three conditions for the inclusion map $V\setminus W\hookrightarrow V$ to be 2-connected (where $W\subset V$ is a subvariety). 

What about Mehta and Seshadri (Math. Ann. 248, 1980)? Their paper handles the genus 2 or more cases (with a focus on one marked point), but my understanding is that their result and proof (generically) generalizes to genus 1 and 0 (and arbitrary many marked points). Perhaps a good project for your student would be to read their paper, and explain how the genus 1 case can be deduced from their work. The main point of my response is not to just offer a reference. It is to suggest that a good reading assignment for a graduate student might involve reading and modifying an argument. I think this puts the student in a position to need to actively understand the ideas, but just passively read them. I recall reading in a different paper (of H. Boden) that a detailed account of the genus 1 and 0 cases is in Seshadri (Asterisque, 96,1982); already mentioned in a comment. So perhaps it is best to have the student not look at that one (for the exercise), but it is good for the mentor to have resources in case one gets stuck. For the record, Hans Boden's papers on parabolic bundles also make good papers for graduate students to read (since he writes well); in particular, his paper Variations of moduli of parabolic bundles is rather nice. 

For the case of compact $G$, see Proposition 3.27 in: Freed, Daniel S. Classical Chern-Simons theory. I. Adv. Math. 113 (1995), no. 2, 237–303. For the case of complex reductive $G$, see Theorem 61 in: Sikora, Adam S. Character varieties. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 364 (2012), no. 10, 5173–5208. 

This is an old question, and I am not sure if there is still interest in it. However, I think from the point-of-view that the moduli space of rank 2 semistable holomorphic vector bundles with trivial determinant on a genus 2 surface $\Sigma$ is diffeomorphic to the character variety $\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_1(\Sigma),SU(2))/SU(2)$ the answer is yes. I think the point is that the Goldman Poisson structure, a Lie algebra structure and derivation, is defined globally on the coordiante ring of the character variety. In general, such a Poisson structure gives a foliation of the smooth locus by symplectic sub-manifolds. In this case there is one leaf (since the surface in question is closed) and the smooth locus is the whole space since it is $\mathbb{C}P^3$. Remark: For a direct proof, not using the theory of holomorphic bundles, that the character variety is $\mathbb{C}P^3$ see here. 

In the affine setting over $\mathbb{C}$, an algebraic set is path-connected in the analytic topology if it is irreducible (in fact, its smooth locus is path-connected too). Conversely, it is irreducible if and only if it contains a dense open path-connected subset of smooth points. See the appendix here. 

Finite disjoint unions of affine space are affine paved. Let's call these examples "trivial." Projective space is affine paved. The Bruhat cells in a flag variety show there are interesting projective examples. 

I am not sure it is relevant exactly, or if you still have interest in this problem, but perhaps you might find this comment useful or interesting. $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^r,G)$ is generally NOT path-connected. For instance, if $r\geq 3$ and $G=\mathsf{SO}(n)$, over $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, for $n\geq 4$ then it is disconnected. Thus, in this setting, there are commuting collections $\lbrace A_i\rbrace$ and $\lbrace B_j\rbrace$ that are NOT connected by a path through commuting elements. 

Anyway, it is a shot in the dark, probably this is not possible...just the first thing I thought of when I read the question. 

So I don't think I am going to answer your question here, and I think you probably know most of what I am going to write at this point. But perhaps this information will be of use to others that happen to pass by this thread. Let $G$ be algebraic (including compact, and complex reductive) and denote $R(G)=\mathrm{Hom}(\pi,G)$. The tangent space of $R(G)$ at $\rho$ always make sense since it is algebraic and it is the twisted cocycles $Z^1(\pi,\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{Ad}\rho})$. Likewise, the tangent space to a conjugation orbit also generally makes sense and is the twisted coboundaries $B^1(\pi,\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{Ad}\rho})$. Both of these are results of Weil from Remarks on cohomology of groups, I believe. Unfortunately the tangent space to a quotient is not always the quotient of the tangent spaces, so it is not true that the tangent space to $R(G)/G$ is always $H^1(\pi,\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{Ad}\rho})$. Note that if $G$ is compact this quotient is the orbit space, and if $G$ is complex reductive it is the GIT quotient. An easy example is the following: Let $\pi=\mathbb{Z}$ and let $G=\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Then the GIT quotient $R(G)/G$ is $\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$, parameterized by coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, and so is smooth. Thus the tangent space to the identity character is $\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$. On the other hand, the orbit of the identity is trivial and it is a smooth point in $R(G)=G$. So the cocycles are $\mathfrak{g}=\mathbb{C}^{n^2-1}$ and the coboundaries are trivial. Thus the first cohomology is also $\mathbb{C}^{n^2-1}$ which is much bigger than the correct result of $\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$. However the following is true. If $\rho \in R(G)$ is smooth (always true for irreducible reps in surface groups, and all reps in twisted surface groups and all reps in free groups), and also have a closed conjugation orbit, then using an appropriate Slice Theorem (Luna, or Mostow) one can prove that the tangent space at the equivalence class $[\rho]$ is the tangent space at 0 in a quotient of cohomology: $T_0(H^1(\pi,\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{Ad}\rho})/C)$, where $C$ is the centralizer of $\rho$ in $G$. But in general there are known counter examples. See here. Returning to the above example, we then have $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})/C=\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ since $C=\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ (still parameterized by the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, but now instead of the determinant being fixed, the trace is fixed). If the centralizer is acts trivially one recovers the usual statement that the tangent space is $H^1(\pi,\mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{Ad}\rho})$. For example, this holds for irreducible representations and $G=\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ (or their maximal compact subgroups), and $\pi$ is a free group or a (twisted) surface group. But even when $\pi$ is a free group and $G=\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ and $\rho$ is an irreducible representation there are counter examples (namely there are irreducible singularities in that case). There is always an open dense subset of smooth irreducibles and a further subset of those whose centralizer is equal to the center of $G$. These are called "good" representations (a la Millson). The set of good representations modulo G is a manifold, and the set of all irreducibles forms an orbifold (for general $G$ irreducible means that $\rho(\pi)$ is not contained in a parabolic subgroup). Let me try to briefly address (1). Whenever the dimension of the tangent space is the dimension of the space, in the strong topology there is a neighborhood that looks like a ball. The converse is not true in general. Think of $x^2=y^3$ which has a singularity at $(0,0)$ algebraically but the neighborhood of $(0,0)$ in the variety is homeomorphic to a Euclicean neighborhood. On the other hand $xy=0$ also has a dimension jump in tangent space at $(0,0)$ but no neighborhood is homeomorphic to a ball. Anyway, singularities in an algebraic setting can be mild or wild or something in between (like orbifold type). With respect to (1), if $[\rho]$ is in the interior of a maximal simplex, I think it might still depend on $[\rho]$. Anyway, in general (as the example $x^2=y^3$ shows) knowing that a point in a semi-algebraic set has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a ball does not tell you it is not singular. Note: A recent paper of Millson and Kapovich shows that singularities in character varieties can get as bad as you can imagine. See here. For $\pi$ a free group however, I believe generally (for all but a finite number of counter examples) the situation is this: reducibles are singular and have no neighborhood homeomorphic to a ball. For $\pi$ a free group and $G$ equal to $\mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n,\mathbb{C})$ this more or less has been established. See my paper here. Also the irreducibles are either smooth or admit orbifold singularieties. But there are orbifolds that are homeomorphic to manifolds (but not always), so it seems that one could have an orbifold singularity (with an irreducible) that happens to have a neighborhood homeomorphic to a ball (this would give a negative answer to (1)). I don't however have an example to show this for certain. About (2), if the cohomology corresponds to the tangent space (like for free groups, or twisted surface groups), then yes, at a singularity, the dimension must jump, and hence the cohomology does too. But if the point does not correspond to cohomology to begin with, then although the tangent space must still have a dimension jump, the cohomology conceivably could not. Again, I don't have an example to show this for certain.
