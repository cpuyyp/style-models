The 2-group is $B\mathbb Z/2$. In other words, the automorphism $1$-group of $M_{1,1}$ is trivial, and the identity functor $M_{1,1} \to M_{1,1}$ has exactly one non-identity invertible natural transformation to itself: the one which sends a family of elliptic curves $\xi \colon E \to S$ to $\xi \circ i \colon E \to S$, where $i$ is inversion in the group structure of $E$. The claim about the $1$-group was explained in the comments: the automorphism $1$-group of $\overline M_{1,1}$ is $\mathbb G_m$, since $\overline M_{1,1} \cong \mathbb P(4,6)$. None of these automorphisms fix the point at infinity. So we need only to determine the natural equivalences from the identity to itself. Such a natural equivalence would assign to any $\newcommand{\id}{\mathrm{id}}\xi \colon E \to S$ an automorphism $a_\xi \colon E \to E$ over $S$, and it should satisfy the conditions of a natural transformation. For any $E \to S$ the automorphism group of $E$ over $S$ has two distinguished elements, $\id$ and $-\id$, and these are stable under pullback. In particular given $S' \to S$ and $\xi' \colon E' \to S'$ the pullback of $\xi$, if $a_\xi$ is trivial or inversion in the group, then the same holds for $a_{\xi'}$. The converse holds by descent if $S' \to S$ is étale. Now let $X \to M_{1,1}$ be an étale cover by a scheme, let $\eta \colon C \to X$ be the pullback of the universal family. There is an open dense $U \subset X$ such that the only automorphism of $C$ over $U$ is inversion in the group. Then the same holds globally on $X$, so $a_\eta = \pm \id$, because the isomorphism scheme of $C$ over $X$ is separated. Let $\xi \colon E \to S$ be arbitrary. There is an étale cover $S' \to S$ such that $\xi'$ is pulled back from $\eta$. Then $a_{\xi'}$ is $\pm \id$. Then the same is true for $a_\xi$. 

The famous Harer stability theorem asserts that the homology group $H_d(\mathcal{M}_{g,n},\mathbf{Z})$ is independent of g and n in the range $0 \leq 2d < g-1$. This is proven by analyzing the maps of mapping class groups $\Gamma_{g,n}\to \Gamma_{g+1,n}$ given by gluing a torus with a disk removed to a boundary circle (when $n \geq 1$), and $\Gamma_{g,n} \to \Gamma_{g,n-1}$ by gluing in a disk, and showing that these maps induce an isomorphism on homology in low dimensions (regardless of the choices involved in writing down such maps). By considering curves with level structures, one obtains finite covers of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$, or equivalently, finite index subgroups of the mapping class group. So let's consider a finite group G, and denote by $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}[G]$ the moduli space parametrizing n-pointed smooth curves of genus g equipped with an étale G-torsor. Is the corresponding statement for $H_d(\mathcal{M}_{g,n}[G],\mathbf{Z})$ known? It is not hard to write down analogues in this context of the maps of mapping class groups above. Remark: The corresponding statement for moduli of spin curves is known (and is also a theorem of Harer), so one might hope for a statement like this because of the similarities between the spaces of r-spin curves and the spaces of curves with $G=\mathbf{Z}/r\mathbf{Z}$ level structure. 

My question is: just what kind of Galois-theoretical or number-theoretical statements do people hope to prove by studying dessins? Are there at this point any theorems proven via dessins which can be stated without using the language of dessins? 

The cycle class map from Chow groups to Borel-Moore homology lands in the lowest weight part, so the above is somehow analogous to the fact that proper pushforward is surjective in Chow for a surjective map. If $f$ instead is an open immersion, then the induced map on lowest weights is also surjective. This is similarly analogous to the fact that flat pullback is surjective in Chow for open immersions. But here the proof for the result in Borel-Moore homology is very simple, which is one reason I think there should be a simple proof of the above result, too. 

I'm not sure how helpful this is, but anyway: in the étale cohomology of a variety over a finite field there is an action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf F}_q/\mathbf F_q)$ on $$ H^\bullet_{\text{ét}}(X \times_{\mathbf F_q} \overline{\mathbf F}_q,\mathbf Q_\ell) $$ and in the Betti cohomology of a complex variety there is a Galois action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbf C/\mathbf R)$ on $$ H^\bullet(X(\mathbf C),\mathbf C).$$ In the first case the Galois action is on the first factor, i.e. on the variety. In the second case the Galois action is on the second factor, i.e. on the coefficients. This is why there is no need for $X$ to be defined over the real numbers in the second case. I think your misconception is that since the weight filtration in étale cohomology encodes the absolute values of Frobenius eigenvalues, that there should be a similarly strong relation between weight filtration and Galois action in Betti cohomology. The action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\mathbf C/\mathbf R)$ is important in Hodge theory because it's what allows you to talk about the $(p,q)$-decomposition. But it can't be what gives rise to weights, since the weight filtration exists already with $\mathbf Q$-coefficients. 

Here is a long and belated answer, mostly written so that I can work out some details I should have worked out long ago. The short version of it is the following: when $g > 0$, one needs the notion of a twisted modular operad in order to describe the precise sense in which the "gravity operad" is an operad. I do hope all signs below are correct. The "standard" motivation for introducing twisting is that it is needed for the higher genus generalization of the bar transform (the "Feynman transform"): twisted modular operads appear naturally as "Feynman duals" of ordinary operads. The following is a different perspective. Remark: Since the gravity operad was introduced by Getzler, who also proved it dual to the hypercommutative operad, and since the gravity operad is the only twisted modular operad discussed in any detail in Getzler-Kapranov's paper, it seems plausible that this was one of their main motivating example for introducing the notion of twisting. The starting point is the situation in genus zero, and Getzler's paper "Operads and moduli of genus 0 Riemann surfaces". We consider the collection of spaces $\newcommand{\M}{\overline{M}} \M_{0,n}$, which form a cyclic operad in the category of algebraic varieties. Taking cohomology we get a cyclic co-operad $H^\bullet(\M_{0,n})$. So far nothing surprising. The surprise is that even though the spaces $M_{0,n}$ do not form an operad in any natural sense, their cohomologies still do - this is the "gravity" operad. Moreover, the two cohomology operads are dual in a precise sense (which is purely a genus zero phenomenon), but I will not talk about that. The magic words that make the cohomology of $M_{0,n}$ an operad are "Poincaré residue". For this read Deligne, "Hodge II", pp 31-32, or Peters-Steenbrink, pp 92-93. The short version is that the Poincaré residue is defined whenever you have an open subvariety $U \subset X$ where $X$ is smooth and the complement is a simple normal crossing divisor. Let the divisor be $D_1 \cap \cdots \cap D_N$, let $D_I = \bigcap_{i\in I} D_i$, and let $D_I^\circ$ denote the interior of the intersection (the complement in $D_I$ of all other components $D_j$). Then it is a map $H^\bullet(U) \to H^{\bullet-|I|}(D_I^\circ)$. Apply this to $X = \M_{0,n}$ and $U = M_{0,n}$: the set of possible intersections $D_I$ is exactly the set of all stable trees with $n$ legs, and $D_I^\circ$ is the corresponding product of open moduli spaces $M_0(\Gamma) = \prod_{v \in \mathrm{Vert}(\Gamma)} M_{0,n(v)}$ (where $n(v)$ = valence of the vertex). Hence we have co-composition maps $H^{\bullet+|\mathrm{Edge}(\Gamma)|}(M_{0,n}) \to H^\bullet(M_{0}(\Gamma))$, in particular $$ H^{\bullet+1}(M_{0,n+n'}) \to H^\bullet(M_{0,n+1}) \otimes H^\bullet(M_{0,n'+1}),$$ and we would like to say that this makes the cohomology of $M_{0,n}$ a co-operad. There is one obvious problem here, which is that there is a degree shift in the definition. This is not such a big deal: we can get rid of it by declaring instead that the collection $$ \{ H^{\bullet-1}(M_{0,n})\}$$ should form a co-operad of graded vector spaces. But even this does not give us a co-operad. The issue is in the very definition of Poincaré residue: it is only defined up to an ordering of the boundary divisors, which potentially introduces a sign ambiguity. This is dealt with explicitly in Deligne who twists everything by a kind of orientation sheaf $\varepsilon^n$ to get things defined canonically. However, there is a simple operadic solution also to this problem: the correct statement is instead that the collection $$ \{ H^{\bullet-1}(M_{0,n}) \otimes \mathrm{sgn}_n\}$$ does form a cyclic co-operad of graded vector spaces. Here $\mathrm{sgn}_n$ is the sign representation of the symmetric group. So far so good. Now we wish to generalize this to higher genera. Again the spaces $\M_{g,n}$ form a modular operad, and their cohomologies $H^\bullet(\M_{g,n})$ a co-operad. We would like to play the same game again to get a co-operad structure on the cohomology of $M_{g,n}$. The self-glung gives us maps $$ H^{\bullet+1}(M_{g+1,n-2}) \to H^{\bullet}(M_{g,n})$$ that we would like to use to define the modular co-operad structure. Hence we are led to introducing a second degree shift, now depending on the genus: one might hope that the spaces $$ \{ H^{\bullet+g-1}(M_{g,n}) \otimes \mathrm{sgn}_n\}$$ will form a suitable modular co-operad. This is unfortunately not true! The self-gluing does not work with this definition, as the $\mathbb{S}_2$-action on the two points that get identified is not the right one. In fact no strategy like the one used in genus zero will work in this situation. What one should then do is to define one's way out of the situation. Instead of an "ordinary" operad $\newcommand{\P}{\mathcal{P}}\P$ with structure maps $$ \P(\Gamma) \to \P(n)$$ where $\Gamma$ is a rooted tree with $n$ inputs, or an "ordinary" modular operad with structure maps $\P(\Gamma) \to \P(g,n)$ where $\Gamma$ now has genus $g$ and $n$ legs, one introduces a "twisting" $\newcommand{\D}{\mathfrak{D}}\D$ such that there are maps $$ \D(\Gamma) \otimes \P(\Gamma) \to \P(g,n).$$ Then $\D(\Gamma)$ is required to depend functorially on $\Gamma$ in certain ways making it meaningful to talk about associativity and equivariance conditions. One has defined the notion of a twisted modular operad. The game we played in genus zero can now be re-interpreted: instead of saying that $ \{ H^{\bullet-1}(M_{0,n}) \otimes \mathrm{sgn}_n\}$ is a cyclic co-operad, we can say that the usual cohomology groups $ \{ H^{\bullet}(M_{0,n})\}$ form a cyclic $\D$-co-operad, where $\D(\Gamma)$ is given by a suspension for each edge on the graph, and tensoring with the sign representation of the symmetric group acting on the set of edges: in other words, $\D(\Gamma) = \mathrm{Det}(\mathrm{Edge}(\Gamma))^{-1}$, using the terminology introduced in Getzler-Kapranov's paper. This more abstract (but in a sense much more natural) definition now works without any changes also in higher genus!! In this framework one can also give a nice explanation of why these suspensions and sign changes worked in genus zero. The correct cocycle to twist with was $\D(\Gamma)$ defined in the preceding paragraph. But $\D$ is cohomologous, in an appropriate sense, to the cocycle $D(\Gamma) = \mathrm{Det}(H_1(\Gamma))^{-1}$, which is trivial when restricted to trees. In fact $\D$ and $D$ differ by a coboundary, and this coboundary is precisely given by putting a suspended copy of the sign representation in each spot $(g,n)$. So we have recovered exactly the recipe for making $H^\bullet(M_{0,n})$ into a co-operad that we wrote down in an ad hoc way above. 

In general you have a Hom scheme $\mathrm{Hom}_S(X,Y)$ for $X$ and $Y$ two schemes over $S$ whenever $S$ is noetherian, $X$ flat and projective, $Y$ quasi-projective. It decomposes into connected components depending on the Hilbert polynomial of the graph of $f$ in $X \times_S Y$. If $X$ and $Y$ are curves, this gives $\mathrm{Hom}_S(X,Y) = \coprod_d \mathrm{Hom}^d_S(X,Y)$ where $\mathrm{Hom}^d_S(X,Y)$ parametrizes maps of degree $d$. Now an isogeny of elliptic curves is just a map of positive degree which preserves the origin, so you're done. 

Let $A$ and $B$ be $A_\infty$-algebras. It's true, but it's a quite nontrivial fact, that the tensor product $A \otimes B$ can be given the structure of $A_\infty$-algebra, too. What is much easier to prove is that the tensor product of an $A_\infty$-algebra with a dg-algebra is again an $A_\infty$-algebra. One can ask similarly whether the tensor product of a $C_\infty$-algebra and an $L_\infty$-algebra is an $L_\infty$-algebra, generalizing the simple fact that the tensor product of a commutative algebra and a Lie algebra is again a Lie algebra. But in fact I can't even prove what should be a much simpler statement: that the tensor product of a $C_\infty$-algebra with a Lie algebra is an $L_\infty$-algebra. Is this true? Remark. What is quite clear is that the tensor product of a commutative algebra and an $L_\infty$-algebra is an $L_\infty$-algebra.
