A tip: try to write in your own language with the Persian alphabet, that will let you remember it and allow you to acquire faster writing skills. I always did it with all the writing systems I learned, it always works. 

Russian normally does not use the verb 'to be' in the Present Tense ('есть' for all numbers and persons), it just omits the verb altogether: 

That is for historical reasons, and it dates back millenia to those times when the ancient Indo-European languages were pro-drop, that is they tended not to use personal pronouns as subjects, many are still like that, for example Polish. Some examples from Latin: te amo means "I love you" (lit. "you I-love"), but te amamus means "we love you" (lit. "you we-love"). As you can see, there are no subject pronouns in those sentences, still the verb form clearly shows what is meant. All the modern Indo-European languages, including English, stem from a pro-drop ancient ancestor language, the use of personal pronouns as subjects is a later innovation, and some modern IE languages lost the subject-verb agreement completely, like Swedish or Afrikaans. 

The simplest way to determine whether a verb is stative is to see if you can use that verb in a Continuous (aka Progressive) tense. If you cannot, then it is a stative verb. Since in your sentence the verb is in the Present Continous tense, the verb to miss is not stative, it is dynamic. 

No. Farsi has no grammatical gender, its nouns are not divided into Masculine, Feminine, and Neuter, neither are its adjectives. Farsi even has no distinction between 'he' and 'she', both of them are the same, /u/ او. 

Word-finally and preconsonantally, it lengthens the preceding vowel. Between front vowels /e, i, ø, y/ it is an approximant, either front-velar [ɰ̟] or palatal [j]. Otherwise, intervocalic ğ is phonetically zero (deleted). 

The answer is no. Some languages, namely the ergative languages, don't have such parts of sentence as subject and object which are typical for most European languages. Instead, they have agent and patient which don't directly correspond to subject and object. For example, in the two English sentences "The man has arrived." and "The man saw the boy." the subject is "the man". If you translate these sentences into Basque, you'll get "Gizona etorri da." and "Gizonak mutila ikusi du." The first word, "gizon" (man) is marked with different cases in the two Basque sentences, in the firs one it is patient, in the second one it is agent, and the word "mutil" (boy) is the patient in the second sentence, it is marked with the absolute case ending -a, just the same way as the word "gizon" (man) in the first sentence. 

No language can have something one, there are no languages with one tense, or one case, or one number, etc. There always must be an opposition for the category to exist in a language. For example, Hungarian has only the definite article a/az (az before a vowel). But you cannot say Hungarian has just one article, because the absence of the article in Hungarian is meaningful, it means the indefinite noun state, that is why the definite article a/az is opposed to the zero article. The same in English: the money vs. money – the zero article means "not definite, i.e. indefinite". If you take Russian which has no articles whatsoever, you cannot say that all the nouns there have zero articles, because they are not opposed to anything non-zero. In such cases we say that a language has no such category. There is no category of definiteness/indefiniteness in Russian, that is why there are no even zero articles in it. If it looks like a language has something one (one tense, or one case, or one number, etc.), we say this language has no tense, no case, no number, etc. If it looks like a category is expressed with zero morphemes only, be sure, that language has no such category. 

It's very easy to find a Chinese character in a dictionary even if it isn's known to you and you don't know its pronunciation. Naturally, to do that you've got to know how to use Chinese dictionaries. There are several different ways a Chinese dictionary is organized and the characters are looked up, and a big good dictionary usually combines several of them, you can choose the one you prefer. The main ways the modern Chinese dictionaries are organized are: 

In languages that have no category of person, like Manju or Malay, there are dozens of politeness-specific words meaning "I" and "you", most of them being actually nouns. In such languages the same word can mean both "I" and "you" depending on who says it to whom, e.g. in Manju, when you talk to the Emperor, the word you must use for "you" is han (noun, meaning 'khan'), and when the Emperor addresses you, the word he uses for "I" is also han. In Malay, when you write a letter to your grandma or grandpa, you use cucunda (noun, meaning 'grandchild') for "I" and nenda (noun, meaning 'grandparent') for "you". But when your grandma writes an answer letter to you, she uses the same 2 words, but with their meaning reversed, nenda for "I" and cucunda for "you". These things can, naturally, be interpreted in different ways, but I think that languages that have the same words for "I" and "you" have a very vague idea of the 1st person pronoun, if any. 

The nine defective verbs: can, could, shall, should, will, would, may, might, must: I cannot do that. The verb 'let': Let me help you. The verb 'help': He helps me do my homework. (Nowadays many use the to-infinitive after 'help'.) The verb 'make' in the meaning 'to cause': He made me cry. The verb 'do' (Past 'did') used to form questions, negative sentences, and emphatic sentences in the Present Simple Tense and in the Past Simple Tense: Do you know him? (question), I don't know him. (negative), I do know him! (emphatic); After 'needn't': You needn't go there.
