I'll take the question to mean "could any contemporary Allied commander have taken over from Gamelin in 1940 and won the Battle Of France?" Anything else is too broad or drifts into fantasy. The question is still very broad, so I'll focus on one aspect: the mechanized maneuver warfare which was the real German "secret weapon". Could any contemporary Allied commander have taken over from Gamelin in 1940 and adapted to the mechanized maneuver warfare being used by the Germans? No, Because WWII Was Different Than All Before It. 

I found a site with extensive information about the cannon. It includes beautiful scale drawings. While they do not include the height and width explicitly, they do have the total length of the cannon (2.5m) which can be used to extrapolate the scale of the images in pixels / cm. Pixels are used because they will not change with your screen or zoom. In the first image the cannon is about 700 pixels long giving 2.8 pixels / cm. In the second it is about 370 pixels long giving about 1.5 pixels / cm. These are rough measurements. 

It has been noted that The Fatal Eggs has many parallels with The War of the Worlds published 30 years earlier. The War of the Worlds had aliens firing a heat ray. It's the 1920s and electricity is the thing now, so The Fatal Eggs has an electric revolver. In the years before publication "scientists" started claiming they had invented various death rays which could have been inspiration to toss one of his own in. 

I can't speak to the specifics of the Soviet Union, but I want to address the opening assumption of the question. 

One example is that the United States was not technically an "ally" but rather an "associated power" who declared war on Germany for violating their neutrality. They wished to avoid "foreign entanglements" and so did not want to get involved in a European alliance. The countries fighting the Central Powers are referred to in treaties as "The Allied Powers" or "The Allied and Associated Powers". For example there are... 

Whenever 20th century cavalry comes up, it often gets confused with mounted infantry. So let's clear that up. Cavalry is trained to fight from horseback using pistol, sabre, carbine, lance, and the horse itself. Its primary purpose is cross open terrain quickly, crash through the enemy line, and cause disarray. If they can do this from an open flank, rather than charging straight into the guns, so much the better. Mounted infantry are different; they ride their horse to the battle, dismount, and fight as normal leg infantry. The advantage is mobility, being able to move quickly from point A to point B to surprise the enemy or as a mobile reserve to respond to an attack. They're no different than truck, ski, or bicycle troops... except maybe it's a bit more romantic. There was far more mounted infantry in WWII than there were cavalry. Mounted infantry often gets confused with cavalry. 

@Henry covered the tactical angle, there's also a strategic one. The War of 1812, lasting from 1812 to 1815, happened at the tail end of Britain fighting France and Napoleon since 1792. Until 1814 it was a side show for the British, particularly the bulk of the British Navy was preoccupied blockading France and French occupied territory. But in April 1814 Napoleon was finally defeated and sent into exile by the Sixth Coalition; he'd be back in a year, but the British didn't know that at the time. With the apparent end of the Napoleonic Wars, the British were free to turn their full attention to the war with the US. The bulk of these forces went to Canada to invade New York, they were defeated in the Battle of Plattsburgh. Some, including a brigade of Duke Wellington's veterans, joined the forces blockading the US Atlantic coast. With these additional forces the British planned two raids, one against Baltimore and one against Washington DC, to divert forces away from the Canadian border. The US Secretary Of War did not think the British would attack Washington DC as it had little strategic value, choosing to concentrate on defending the important seaport of Baltimore, and so Washington DC was left lightly defended. 

This is repeated time and again with Japanese carriers, most spectacularly at Midway where the US aircraft caught the Japanese rearming. Akagi is hit by a single bomb landing in a hanger filled with armed and fueled bombers. Their pumps and flooding systems failed and she was lost to fire. Kaga is hit by three bombs, Sōryū takes the same, and Hiryū takes four. Bad damage to be sure, but recoverable. They both suffer fates similar to Akagi: armed and fueled bombers contribute to the damage, and their damage control systems fail. In contrast, the USS Yorktown is hit by three bombs and an out of control dive bomber. But in anticipation of the attack they stopped all fueling activities, even dumping fuel tanks overboard. Fires in the hanger deck (also filled with armed and fueled aircraft) are quickly extinguished and she's able to resume fueling within 90 minutes. Two torpedoes put a stop to that, she's abandoned, but does not burn or sink. Salvage teams begin to repair the damage, but she takes two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine. Still she doesn't sink. Yorktown is finally sunk by her own destroyers for fear of Japanese submarines and aircraft picking off American ships. 

"The Albany and Rensselaer Iron and Steel Works, Troy, New York" by A. L. Holley is an excellent source. Holley licensed the technology from Bessemer and set up the Troy mill. His book, published in 1881, has extensive detail about the plant. It used three 7-ton vessels. 

The Eastern Front of WWII was fought on a scale that the Western Front wouldn't see for two more years if at all. To give one example for comparison Operation Uranus, the Soviet counter attack at Stalingrad, was fought with 1 million Soviet troops, 1000 tanks, 1500 aircraft, and 13,000 artillery pieces. And this was November 1942 on a single front. At about the same time the British were fighting the Second Battle of El Alamein with 100,000 men, 500 tanks, 800 aircraft, and just 500 artillery pieces. The scale of fighting on the Eastern Front would not be seen in the West until well after the Battle of Normandy. On the theme of doing it before everyone else, the Soviets concentrated artillery in ways that only the Americans would begin to match in late 1944. Again, Operation Uranus concentrated an accurate barrage of 3,500 artillery pieces on the Third Romanian Army. Massive, crushing artillery barrages would continue to be a feature of Soviet offensives all the way to Berlin. 

Then he scuttled the rest of his ships and marched inland. For more read the The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz. It's a very easy read. Specifically... 

German guided weapons were driven by their desperate need to stop the overwhelming production of Allied armor, ships and bombers. Infantry and pilots needed a weapon that could reliably destroy them outside the range of their defenses. Thus an array of guided weapons were trialed by the Germans. Many used terrifyingly unstable fuels. Most did not see operational use and were cancelled with only the anti-ship missiles Fritz X and the Hs 293 seeing significant deployment. The Allies were doing a fine job destroying German aircraft and tanks, but their bombers were woefully inaccurate. Their guided weapons focused on precision bombing. The Azon and the Bat were operational during the war. The GB-8 and VB-6 Felix were beginning production as the war ended. 

From the beginning of the American Civil War, Virginia had two governments. The original pro-succession government with it's capital in Richmond, and a newly formed Restored or Reorganized Government of Virginia which also claimed Richmond as its capital, but really was in Wheeling (then still part of Virginia) and later Alexandria once West Virginia came into being. The Restored Government considered the secession in violation of the Virginia constitution since it was done without the consent of the people, it was done by the legislature, and declared the existing government illegal. The Federal government, unsurprisingly, recognized them as the legitimate government of Virginia and seated its congressmen. It was this Restored Government that signed the 13th Amendment. For reference, here's some interesting letters passed back and forth between the Restored Government and the Federal Government.

It seems WWI and inter-war ship designers went a bit torpedo mad, both in their fear of them and in their use, finally coming to their senses in the harsh realities of WWII. I've seen many examples of capital ships using extensive space and machinery to mount multiple torpedo tubes. Given the long range of their guns (20,000m and up) compared to the short range of the torpedo (an optimistic 5,000m), this doesn't seem to make sense. Did a torpedo fired from a capital ship (which I'm defining as a heavy cruiser, battlecruiser or battleship) ever hit anything? How many were ever fired in anger? Was it all just a costly boondoggle? Some examples actually built... 

I'm going to take a 10,000 foot view of this. While the scale and speed of the problem has grown immensely, we're still dealing with the same basic sorts of issues that lead to someone wrapping their cigars in a secret order in 1862 and losing the Battle of Antietam. The details have changed, but the basics remain the same. And I'm going to speak about what I know as an IT professional and amateur historian. I can't usefully talk about what's actually going on inside the military and governments. Finally, I talk a lot here about cryptographic hash algorithms, not asymmetric encryption, because that's what I know about in detail. The same principles apply.
