A new 26" freewheel repair wheel starts at around $40US from a bike shop or Amazon, and there are also literally millions of used ones around, so even if it does need a new wheel, if it's an otherwise working bike then this shouldn't be the problem that totals it. The bike in question is old enough that it may be 126mm or 130mm in back as opposed to 135 like you'd find on most repair wheels, but that's an overcomeable problem if so, either by jamming up to a 5mm difference, respacing and redishing, or getting a 130 wheel. As for fixing the hub, the first thing to do, before taking anything apart, is check to see how bent the axle is by spinning the left side with your hand and observing how warbly the right side is, if at all. That can easily cause a lot of resistance and bad feels in the hub, but if it hasn't been too bad too long the rest of the hardware might be usable, and a new cheap axle is only a few dollars. (Note that we're not talking about a nice one, ie Wheels Mfg. We're talking about the other kind, a generic unpackaged OEM-level replacement, which may even come with cones that may be helpful.) The next question is whether the cups and cones are totally disintegrating or just rough, i.e. heavily pitted but still have their basic shape. If the former you need cones or a new wheel if it's the cups, but if it's the latter then a new axle, new bearings, and new grease will generally be fine for a low-mileage bike. If you do need new cones, old random freewheel hubs often use one of a couple different common basic shapes, and so cheap no-name cones often can be made to work, especially if you find a shop that has some different ones to choose from. This is actually the main application where cheap little generic "axle sets" such as the one linked to above can be useful. Determining suitable replacement cones and getting the hub properly set up with them is a larger topic; one place I know of you can read a lot about it is older free copies of Barnett's Manual floating around the internet. Cones can be re-ground to an extent. You can get pretty sophisticated with it, but a very simple method is put the cone and a locknut on a nice straight axle in an electric drill such that the drill chuck is right against the locknut, so as the cone spins there won't be much run out. Find some kind of dowel or shaft of a diameter that matches the profile of the bearing, probably 1/4" in this case, wrap it in sandpaper or emery cloth, and clamp that in a vise. Hold the spinning cone up to it to resurface it. Go slow so it doesn't get too hot. You don't have infinite material to lose with this approach before the cone isn't the right shape anymore, but it generally works pretty well. 

Just to be clear, measuring the difference between a French fork and the more common ISO/British is super easy. The OD of a French steerer is 25mm, and common 1" is 25.4. The thread pitch is also different. The parts just don't fit right together. Making this mistake and sending it out the door without noticing anything amiss is implausible. Also, if you did have a French fork and it's being replaced with ISO, they owe you a new stem too because the quill OD/steerer ID is .2mm less on French than ISO. 

FWIW, most nicer modern hydro levers have either a hinge, faceplate, or other scheme to allow this as well. 

The main distinction is whether the puller is for square taper (and Powerspline) versus Octalink/ISIS. Among square taper crank pullers, there are some older ones made with nutted spindles in mind that don't play nice with the now more common bolt-style ones because their tips are too narrow and can jam into the bolt hole and damage the threads. A couple companies now have good all-in-one tools with switchable tips that work on both square taper and Octalink/ISIS. There is no road versus mountain distinction with crank pullers. One size of extractor thread has been used on the vast majority of cranks for a long time, M22x1. There are several older sizes on cranks made by T/A, Stronglight, and possibly some more obscure ones, all of which need their own extractors. There's also some more contemporary brand/model specific designs such as the Profile ones and Cannondale SI. Within BMX, there's now about a million model-specific crank removal tools, and a whole other discussion of cross-compatibility. 

You don't indicate whether you've got a square taper (older) Record BB or one of the Campagnolo outboard bearing systems (Ultra Torque or Power Torque). If it's an outboard Campy BB and crank, the spindle is a larger diameter than Shimano (25mm as opposed to 24mm), among probably other issues, so it will not work. If it's square taper, Campy uses a different taper geometry at the taper called ISO, as opposed to the JIS standard that almost all other cranks use. More info on this here. As that page indicates, while there is some risk associated with having less spindle engagement, a lot of people successfully mix and match JIS BBs onto ISO cranks without issues. Ideally you get a spindle that's about 9mm shorter than whatever ISO spindle gave you correct chainline before, because the cranks each sit on the spindle about 4.5mm out from before. Note that the good way of figuring this out is before taking anything apart, first observe what chainline the old BB is giving you and whether there would be any issues with making it better if it's not already perfect, then pull the cranks and see what spindle length you've got. Your Gios may have an Italian BB shell. This isn't a big issue but if so you'll likely need to order the new BB. Usually the BB is marked somewhere with its thread pitch, 36mm x 24 tpi for Italian.
