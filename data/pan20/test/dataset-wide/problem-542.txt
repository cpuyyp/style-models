When I ride into the office I use the hair driers in the changing room to kickstart the drying process and then, during the day, I leave them on a ventilation grid close to my desk. I also use the wadded up newspaper method - but I find that the stream of (dry) air is more effective if available. 

Yes. A fixed wheel does not need two, it needs only one (on the non-fixed, presumably the front, wheel). Two separate and independent bracking systems, one per wheel, are required, but as the CTC say 

I would certainly give a lot of attention to the chainring and lockring. One question that I think you need to answer is whether the lockring was loose before the incident or did the chain jamming the cog cause the lockring to come adrift. Then you need to consider whether the lockring loosened naturally, i.e. did it turn along the thread, or was it forced sideways? Do you tend to use a rear brake? From the question I get the impression you don't. (This isn't a criticism - I don't have a rear brake on my fixed, either.) If you use back pressure a lot when slowing and the lockring had been a little loose (when was the last time you checked it?) then it might be that that was what helped contribute to the jump - this is probably the best case for you, certainly the case with the least likelihood of damage beyond the tyre's flat spot. If you're sure that the lockring and cog had been tight before the incident, then I would really give the threads a careful review because you might have stripped them and caused some lateral damage. Given the jam, I would certainly be looking at the spokes: go round the wheel, both sides, just trying to gently flex each spoke, they should each hold firm; listen for creaks too. It also never hurts to pop the bike in a stand and just run the wheel round a few revolutions and watch its line - even if the spokes are all firm, you might see a little wobble. And if you're really thorough, go over the chain and check for bent links (and while you're at it, give it a good wipe and a lube, you can't do that enough). 

It's not going to be directly proportional. Leaving aside the quality of the tyre and what it will be rated for, the shape of the graph is likely to be a U shape: 

Flip it back to non-fixed and get the hang of rolling backwards (perhaps down a gentle slope) first. As others have said, the bike is designed for going forwards, so backwards is a real skill. So you've got two major problems - steering and locomotion. Do you drive? Almost all non-4x4 vehicles are front-wheel steered and reversing any distance in a straight line is similarly tricky. If you've driven a rear-wheel steered vehicle, perhaps a tractor or a forked lift, you'll know that they can be really maneuverable in tight spaces but quite tricky to keep in a straight line when going forwards. It is though all about practice. 10000 hours to be world class! Once you can roll backwards unpowered, then try the rolling backwards with the fixed, you'll at least have conquered the steering problem, now you can mix in the locomotion. 

If you use an iOS device, I use an app called Aero Weather (there is a free version, but I liked it enough to show support for the developer and paid for the Pro version). This shows the various feeds available from many airports, runways, aerodromes and other similar sites. You can show the summary of 4-5 airports on an iPhone screen - more than enough to get a quick overview of local conditions. It shows current readings, but you're able to drill in to their forecasts. As others have said, the airport analyses tend to be written by experts so is credible, but the readings are also frequently updated. For my commute/training rides, I have a local list of various airports within 20-30 miles of home so I can get an instant picture of how the wind/temperature/cloud and so on is differing in the various directions. 

Yes - sure. 150km isn't that far and it's more likely that you'll fail before the bike. No - if the you or the bike is in terrible shape, then one or other of you will fail to make it. Maybe - in the same way as the general advice to a novice is to ask a physician for advice before this type of strenuous exercise, take your steed to a local bike repair shop and get their opinion. 

The construction is different, shorts need to have the elastication around the top to keep them in place around your waist and on your hips, this has an obvious effect on the styling. This isn't totally similar to regular shorts, given that cycling shorts need to be designed for a body that's probably bending over a little more than normal so the top of the shorts at the back will be higher (hence also that cycle shirts have a longer back to help cover the inevitable gap that appears when you bend over). So the bibs help with not needing loads of elastic that digs into your sides because they're being held up from your shoulders, but also the construction covers your lower back (including added insulation in winter/cold-weather varietals). Not only are the shorts being held from above, they're being anchored in place so they won't rotate and ride around your sides - which is even more annoying than tight elastic. It's similar to comparing an open-top car against its roofed equivalent - all that extra strength that comes from the roof has to be pushed into the superstructure around the new top of the vehicle. So it is with shorts. Yes, the call of nature is trickier, but I'd rather be comfortable for hours and uncomfortable for a few minutes, than put up with shorts. 

There is some interesting research here (pp 56-60), in amongst some decent comparisons of methodologies, they suggest that reflective material on the major joints makes the real difference in having cyclists being identifiable and identified. The thinking, as I understand it, is that lights are just lights and could be on (more or less) anything but reflective material on ankles and knees introduces motion and makes you look like a cyclist to a viewer's subconscious. This isn't to say that you shouldn't light yourself up like a Christmas tree, but unusual and unexpected things aren't necessarily going to help you be noticed. 

Padding and warmth are covered in other answers, but in the winter I have a third use. In the warmer weather my fingers swell slightly, which doesn't happen so much in the winter, so my wedding ring has a tendency to be looser in colder weather. Long fingered gloves stop me from worrying so much about it slipping off when on bumpier rides. 

Narrower tyres support higher pressures for similar constructions and, basically, higher pressures equate to higher speeds. While a wider tyre, inflated to the same pressure would present a lower rolling resistance (thorough a smaller contact patch), as Sheldon Brown points out, this different effect of two similar tyres which differ only through width is entirely the point of why they differ. For most conditions you get a more comfortable ride on wider tyres with slightly lower pressures, but to get to that point you trade-off speed. Higher pressures also give you some inherent puncture protection - a well maintained tyre under higher pressure will repel potential sharps more effectively than a similarly constructed tyre under lower pressure. 

In this recent blog post, the author (not me, I just subscribe to their feed) indirectly addresses your question: 

Get measured 'properly' and then compare that to your frame - and also consider what you're planning to do on the machine. If you have drop handlebars (e.g. like a road bike) and might be using them a lot, then you'll expect a different setup in comparison to using straight (or courier bars) or aerobars. Also different bikes have different geometries, i.e. the lengths of the various tubes. I have a relatively long back and short legs and I know that certain brands are wrong for me (i.e. the frame is too short and I am very cramped over the handlebars because I've a downtube correct for my legs, but a top tube too short for my back). @curtismchale gives a good set of things you can do yourself, but there really is no substitute for expert advice and measurement here. A few centimetres here and then, a spacer on the stem or longer cranks or dropping the saddle ... 

Trust. Of course the manufacturers trade on that, but would you trust a helmet that cost a meagre amount? The more expensive helmets are generally sculpted and designed to have more ventilation, be lighter, be more adjustable, be more comfortable, but ultimately, do you trust them to do the job. I wear a helmet because when I race I have to and when I commute I'm under personal pressure to wear one. (To be fair I did recently have a crash and my forehead would have looked worse had I not been wearing one - it at least protected me from a longer cut.) Personally I spent more money because I wanted light and comfortable, but I also figure that something that costs the same as a big lunch cannot have been designed, tested and built properly. 

I'm not sure how you'd teach it, but I think an ability to relax and just get on with it has made my commute much more pleasant. I ride about 12 miles each way, through some fairly busy bits of London. There are some bike lanes, advanced stop lines, separated paths and all sorts of possible things to confuse the new bike commuter, but the thing that obviously gets to a lot of people is that there is just so much going on. The noise, the bustle, cars and lorries going in all directions, shouts from pedestrians, not necessarily at you (but sometimes). You have to pay attention to the road, its surface, the upcoming junctions and obstacles, but beyond that, just create a little bubble of calm. You might be faster than other people, you might be slower, but don't let them distract you or at least try to reduce the amount of road rage you create. I see dozens of things on every ride that could (and used) to annoy me - bikes going through red lights or riding on pavements, car drivers cutting up me or other bikes, talking on their mobile phones or turning without indicating - but since I've stopped worrying, I'm enjoying the ride a lot more. Just worry about yourself and let the others find their own path - and every now and then, just pass a comment to a neighbour when you're waiting at a junction. You'll both be happier for it. 

This is a potential minefield. If someone's on my wheel, to be honest I don't care. I prefer not to draft when commuting - I know the state of most of the roads I regularly use and I want decent visibility of the surface and other road users; it's a commute, not a heads-down speed session, so a few extra seconds at a lower speed is of little consequence. Taking over at the front needs careful thought to, especially to make sure that it doesn't look like you're cutting in or, in my case, suddenly blocking me from taking the line I want - not everyone wants you to 'take a turn'. There are enough dangers on the commute in busy traffic that drafting is probably dangerous, if not rude, if they are random others. There are some further thoughts and interesting comments in this recent article. 

The issue with bike lights, as with most consumer electronics and everything else, you get what you pay for. While £50 is a decent budget, you will be making some sacrifices along the way. In a front light that illuminates, rather than just allows you to be seen, it will require more power, which means either buying lots of AA/AAA cells or using rechargables - so you'll need to factor these consumables into your equation. From the top-end options, e.g. Exposure, Hope, Lupine et al, where you'll be spending well into three figures, as you come down in price, you will need to decide what's important. Cheaper models won't stand up to punishment - your canal tow path, is it bumpy? How good a mounting bracket does your light have - will it fall off easily and disappear into the water? How long will it last? Modern LED models generally have great lifespan, but the cheaper the unit, the cheaper the components. They might last you this winter, but next and the one after? Do you want to spend £50 every year or spend a bit more and replacement less often? Of course there's the other option of changing your route to avoid the unlit section - that's free and doesn't need special equipment! For what it's worth, I have an Exposure Toro front light which was expensive but is now almost two years old and the light and batteries are as good as the day I bought it - still absolutely great when in on an unlit trail. Worth every penny. 

And, of course, once you've got where you're going, you'll feel a lot better about yourself if your belongings are dry. I have an excellent Ortleib, courier style bag, which is totally waterproof, sealed by folding over the top. If you can change into dry clothes (in particular dry socks and shoes), embracing the wet is a lot easier. 

Then get all of the above: once you start racing, commuting, shopping and training on the bike you'll be able to justify a time trial, commuter, road and MTB ... and even then you'll probably find another type you're missing! 

The idea used to be that a triple was just a double with an extra small, 'granny' ring (i.e. only grandmothers would need to use that one) so there was definitely some snobbery in a triple; that it was designed for those who needed a little more help. So on the club training run, you might be teased for it. (Google for 'triple granny ring' for various forum discussions and banter; don't worry, most of the responses are SFW.) Practically, what it tends to mean is not necessarily a bigger gear at the top (i.e. big front ring & small back ring) but a much lower gear at the bottom, for the hills. So with the same rear cassette you might compare a 50/34 double for a 50/39/30 triple (although a 50/34 is probably more what is called these days a 'compact'). That range of triple combined with a typical rear cassette of 12-28 would work for most hills. You also get a lot more options; so you'll get the similar effective ratios in several ways, because the ranges on the big ring overlap more with the middle, and the middle with the little one. Also, the gears are closer together - so you're more likely to find something that works well at the right time. It is also easier to change on the front ring of a triple, on a compact you'll often need to change down a gear or two on the back when you move on to the bigger front ring, which means the chain is being yanked both ways and strained that bit more. But on the triple, you're not as far away, so you'll often not need to change the back at the same time as shifting the front. 

The only answer really is, in the UK, what you're doing is illegal. Full stop. There are various factions who will try to mitigate the behaviour on grounds of safety, but, fundamentally, by going through a red light, even if in your opinion there is room, you are putting yourself into a position where other users of that facility do not reasonable expect you to be. What if someone is running for their green man and hits you from the side? Not so much room now! I'm sure that there are many situations where coasting through a red is safe and where you can see the junction is empty. Indeed, there are situations where the red light is only serving to hold people up and I'd happily see all queued users, whether self-powered or motorised, go through the red; but you'd be in the wrong and need to accept whatever punishment is meted out. 

I don't wear a full-face, whole-head helmet because I've weighed up the risks and I don't need one. I'm not a motorcyclist, I don't have to confront the same dangers a motorbike rider does. Full-head helmets for bikes are available, so where there's a demand, there is a supply. 

There are always trade-offs so it depends on what you do, but there will probably always be arguments in favour of multiple bikes. Simple answer, though, is that there is no such thing as the "all-in-one" bike (unless you have a really small, tight definition for "all"). My cyclocross is great (ticks the heavy duty, gear range, off-road, comfortable boxes), but my fixed is way lighter (so is faster, less attractive to thieves, easier to maintain), my time trial bike is fastest (but not so useful for commuting) and my road bike is too fragile for daily use (and too nickable). I couldn't do the shopping on my trial bike, I wouldn't want to leave my road (or trial) bike locked up away from home, I couldn't race on my fixed (even if I wanted to). So the cyclocross is the closest to an allrounder, but there are things it can't do as well (it's not fast, it is relatively heavy).
