Because it's garbage! Do you think there is a correlation between bad metaphysics in popular science and second-rate philosophers dominating public discourse like Rand? I do. It is definitely a sign of the state of things. She became popular here in the US where it is almost a civic duty to be philosophically illiterate. Philosophy is not only viewed with contempt, but it isn't seen as practical or consistent with the mentality of "get er' done." Under such conditions what looks like philosophy gets peddled about as the real thing, and who is really going to judge the difference? A writer like Rand doesn't need academics under such conditions. I don't think it is her fault since she does feel the void for public intellectuals to be philosophical--however impoverished it is. And it is bad! The closest thing you will find to philosophy in the mainstream is either a cosmetic brand of women's makeup that goes by the name on the Home Shopping Network, or the new MTV show called Failosophy which makes fun of wild viral videos. So the fact that Rand has not been read or taken seriously by us academics is a blessing and a curse. For people know who she was and talk about her books. When it comes to academic philosophy nobody knows what we do or actually cares. Her rhetoric and imaginative literature have been able to resist the social pressures which are making philosophy (at least in the academic sense) an irrelevant relic or as a student just told me last semester, what "looks more like your hobby!" It would be difficult to refute that she knew this and could play with people in all kinds of idiosyncratic ways, even in her coffin. Now for the curse, she falls into the fetish of pop culture and academics alike! She is an ideologue with her social blueprint and "ready-to-hand" ISM. I agree with Eric Voegelin that "None of the ideological Isms is acceptable in a critical investigation" (Order and History, Vol. 4, 236). Rand provides another deformative symbolization in the littered "wasteland" of ideologies. She is an irresponsible reader of other philosophers and history. But what else would you expect from one who weaves fiction in as a cover of mass ignorance? She has low standards and that is the bottom-line. Without getting all high-brow or looking for ultimate answers, it is not too much to ask that we shoot for a higher threshold. We have to remain open to the search and possibility of what can be salvaged without settling for "smart idiots" (Eric Voegelin's term) like Rand. 

We hear much talk today about "consciousness explained" or the "selfish gene." These have become fashionable pop culture scientific explanations of the implications of human evolution from Daniel Dennett to Richard Dawkins. But their claims are not only hyper-reductionist, but seem like an anthropogenic sleight of hand. If one takes Alfred N. Whitehead and Conrad Waddington's work in The Nature of Life, for example then the "epigenetic landscape" has to be considered before I can address these more refined aspects of existence. I need to provide an account or philosophy of organism in order to deal with a gene, consciousness, or whatever otherwise my claims will be wholly abstract. Why should we take seriously thinkers who offer only snapshots or puzzle pieces of Nature that they pass off or present as the completed or ultimate story to the mystery? 

It was German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976) who famously said, "animals are poor in world." Although this may be true, I do not see them as being poor in logic. Paleontologists have discussed how in surviving and thriving in one's environment, pre-human species expanded in their "work" to include the acts of cutting, attacking, and throwing. This allowed for the kind of control and mastery--key pursuits of logic--of beings and things at a distance. Out of this simple example you can immediately see the emergence of positive and negative propositions based on the successful or failed/missed cuts, blows, or throws. Here you have the prefigurations of analytical judgments and the subject/predicate copula in pre-linguistic fashion or without language. Therefore, it appears we can appreciate and humble ourselves before logics without buying into the dogmas and fated tendencies of analytic philosophy. Could this less-romanticized narrative of human rationality, be the more honest basis for how human logic was established? 

Whitehead argues in Part II of Process and Reality that to accept simultaneities in the universe would violate the Ontological Principle which is an inflexible or categoreal presupposition of his speculative metaphysics. He writes: “According to the classical ‘uniquely serial’ view of time, two contemporary actual entities define the same actual world. According to the modern view no two actual entities define the same actual world. Actual entities are called ‘contemporary’ when neither belongs to the ‘given’ actual world de¬fined by the other. The differences between the actual worlds of a pair of contemporary entities, which are in a certain sense ‘neighbours,’ are negligible for most human purposes. Thus the difference between the ‘classical’ and the ‘relativity’ view of time only rarely has any important relevance. I shall always adopt the relativity view; for one reason, because it seems better to accord with the general philosophical doctrine of relativity which is presupposed in the philosophy of organism; and for another reason, because with rare exceptions the classical doctrine can be looked on as a special case of the relativity doctrine—a case which does not seem to accord with experimental evidence. In other words, the classical view seems to limit a general philosophical doctrine; it is the larger assumption; and its consequences, taken in conjunction with other scientific principles, seem to be false” (PR, 65-66). This takes place in the section where he also argues quite powerfully that "atomicity" and "continuity" are both consistent with universal relativity. So much for Zeno's paradox! I believe this is a definitive response. Without going into the significant differences between Einstein’s and Whitehead’s theories of relativity, they agree in principle that the simultaneity of actual entities is metaphysically baseless. If two entities did share the same ‘time-system’ then the universe would be deficient in novelty and fail to be creative—the ultimate category of Whitehead’s philosophy of organism. No entity’s world is simultaneous with another’s and that includes God on this account. Thanks for asking this question! 

Just finished reading Ethics without Ontology (2004) by Harvard professor Hilary Putnam where he argues for a pragmatic pluralism, conceptual relativity, and the obligations to recognize and resist human suffering, with also the aim to promote human flourishing. Ontologies of the inflationary (e.g. realism, idealism) or deflationary (e.g. eliminationism, nominalism) strategies fail to take ethical (practical) disagreements seriously because they presuppose a theoretical reductionism that assumes to solve ethical controversies trans-contextually. Putnam writes: “when a practical problem is successfully solved, there is still often controversy as to whether the successful solution can be generalized to the next problem that seems similar; for the degree and significance of the similarity are typically controversial as well!” (30-31, emphasis original). On this view, ontologies act as conventions that prejudice and precondition our interpretive structures. Echoing what he calls the “pragmatic enlightenment,” Putnam claims that Dewey’s methodological “democratic education” and “fallibilism,” when we investigate ethics as “problematic situations” and invite “proposals,” can avoid the absolutizing and “arrogant” tendencies of ontology's "disastrous consequences." “Dewey stressed that problematical situations are contingent and their resolutions are likewise contingent; but there is still a difference, an all-important difference, between thinking that a claim concerning the resolution of a situation is a warranted claim and its actually being warranted” (129, emphasis original). In the spirit of Levinas and others, is it possible or even valuable to have ethics without ontology and does this trump the quandries of objectivity and justification in ethical judgments? 

Nietzsche’s philosophy is notorious for its famous pronouncement that “God is dead. And we have killed him. Yet his shadow still looms. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?” (The Gay Science--Kaufmann, Section 125). When Nietzsche deals with death in the general sense he speaks of the “art of dying at the right time”, very similar to Heidegger's notion of "authentic resoluteness." A free death is one where the dying chose or take death as one’s ownmost possibility, to put it in Heidegger’s Sein und Zeit language. According to Nietzsche, this autonomy and resolve of the will serves as an inspiration to others to be courageous in the midst of such existential Angst. Yet what remains bothersome is how come this free death does not apply to God, or, for example, to the case of Jesus which Nietzsche admits died too young (as a historical figure and not as an agent of the Christian religion). It seems that this possibility would be especially more prevalent in the case of the divine. Does this reveal that Nietzsche's philosophy is not atheistic, but certainly remains theophobic? 

In the introduction to Process and Reality, Whitehead criticizes the tendency to posit logical or ontological necessity as the primary modes of cosmological explanation. For Whitehead time is a contingent specification of extension. Extension is not synonymous with space, but stems from a higher level of generality as the “undivided divisibile” or “extensive continuum.” Employing a functional definition Whitehead argues we are only in a position to say that time and space should not be treated as necessary modalities despite lacking experience with any non-temporal mode of division beyond our cosmic epoch. However, the limits of experience are not exhaustive of the limits of imagination! Knowledge is derived by contrast and the lack of contrast implies the absence of knowledge. When categorizing our experience of time and space as modes of possible divisions of the extensive continuum (receptacle of the universe), Whitehead argues we have no grounds for claiming anything more than that temporal and spatial relations are contingent. They are the modes of division in our immediate epoch--i.e. not the whole cosmic epoch, which impose conditions on the metaphysical description of the present. As Randall Auxier and Gary Herstein argue in their forthcoming book The Quantum of Explanation, which is an intense study of Whitehead’s robust philosophy, “The absence from our experience of other equally primary modes of dividing the extensive continuum is not evidence for the necessity of time and space as its dividers (that is, ultimately, actual entities), it is rather the best reason to treat them as contingent, and to hold open the possibility of other (as yet unknown) modalities of division. Hence, we find Whitehead carefully offering conjectures about what might hold of other cosmic epochs. This process of entering conjectures is familiar to mathematicians, and it does carry with it a kind of weight of expectation, but its principal function is to remind us that the present inquiry exists in a context wider than we can expect to encompass with our hypotheses.” The insistence upon necessity prevalent in popular science is the kind of dogmatism Whitehead insists philosophers, especially scientists, should resist. Most of the history of science and philosophy has assumed we should without questioning it accept the overstatement. But if the order of nature can change within our cosmic epoch (e.g. laws of nature evolve) then what grounds do we have for adopting the reductionist thinking which says that the conditions of our immediate order holds for all orders? 

This compatibility allows for the "becoming of continuity" and not a "continuity of becoming" as is assumed in Zeno's paradox. Under the conditions of our epoch 

Interesting discussion, but it is further evidence of many shortcomings which have impoverished Kant scholarship for too long. What is being assumed here is that Kant is really just a First Critique Kantian, but he wasn’t. Kant’s transcendental philosophy is much bolder than conventional wisdom has it. I take Kant at his word when he claims to be working out a CRITICAL philosophy, not just writing a First Critique, Categorical Imperative, constructing an epistemology, or whatever. You cannot read the First alone, but especially not without the Third and his popular essays which are too often ignored! The power of determinate judgments (Pure Reason) presupposes reflective judgment. Reason and Understanding are both forms of determinative judgments where particulars are subsumed under universals. Therefore, they both serve a legislative function. But in the case of reflective judgments, universals are the domain of all possibilities. Subsumption really entails the exhausting of all possibilities into the actuality derived in the domain of action. It is absurd to assume that of the human cognitive powers (understanding, reason, judgment, imagination) only some have an independent legislative function because they ALL do. The focus of the First Critique is the subsumption of particulars under universals—when a predicate determines its subject, which is not that interesting from the standpoint of logic. But the Critique of Judgment (1790) investigates when a subject determines the predicate or when a particular goes in search of a universals, which is a hallmark of aesthetic judgments of taste! There Kant explains imagination as this “free-play” of reason and understanding through reflective judgment. It is our mediating power of imagining possibilities that might not even exist. It is having the possibility of reflecting upon possibilities which is required as a prerequisite for us to have ANY objects of cognition or engage in acts of the will. The first critique deals with the relationship between judgment and understanding; 2nd critique pertains to the power of reason in relation to judgment; 3rd critique analyzes the relations between reason and understanding in comparison with judgment. Reason is the experience of enlivening the body; Understanding pertains to the cognizing of experience or an empirical object; Judgment is the power of subsumption. Judgment brings the relation of the three together in such a way as to facilitate action, which have ends always in mind. Reflection is putting the possible before the actual. Transcendental philosophy takes this “reflective turn” and asks what within the domain of the possible is actually necessary. It can be done in two ways: 1) negative elimination of the possible and acting on this; 2) looking for the forms or acts of every actual moment will lead us to the domain of possibilities (e.g. space and time). This doesn’t give us knowledge regarding the intrinsic constitution of these forms but are the conditional circumstances of our experience. Transcendental philosophy seeks to uncover the invariant aspects to the process of understanding, which presents objects of cognition according to the sensible manifold. The understanding is a process of synthesizing the sensible manifold according to the “lawful character” of natural processes. An element of judgments regarding our subjective constitution has a domain of universality. Subjective universal is the involuntary feeling completing an act before it even occurs because of given anticipatory structures within the domain of reflective judgments. Within the entire domain of action there is always some element of freedom because of putting possibilities in front of actualities for consideration. This is the function of reflection within the domain of the will, reason, and understanding. Kant’s view of imagination develops and continuously changes such that it would be wrong to say he has a fully worked-out, consistent theory from his pre-critical writings to the Third Critique. One can be suspect of Kant’s theory because of this weakness where the cognitive power of judgment needs to be worked out in relation to the imagination. So the critical philosophy’s presentation of the imagination as an interaction with the possible as being unstable, weak, inconsistent, and misguided in its incompleteness; it appears to be arbitrary at times and challenges the legacy of Kant’s iron-clad architectonic. The 3rd Critique gives us the power of imagination as it works with the possible in terms of how judgment uses imagination in order to employ the possible. The imagination works from the whole to parts, while the understanding and reason whether of sensible or intelligible schemata works from the discrete parts to a scrambling of the whole. The crux of imagination is our ability or power to appropriate the “possible” which adds to and helps inform what is “actual” in experience. For Kant, the difference between pre-critical and critical writings is the difference between putting actuality before possibility and vice versa. Kant makes a wild claim that no one can think about anything which is possible through the actual. In fact, human cognition comes by way of arriving at the actual by the domain of what is possible. Reason is that energy (possibilities) by which we are moved to act everyday according to Kant. I am alive by having concrete possibilities before me and acting on them by making them actualized concretely. This is a reversal of ancient and medieval traditions. Necessity is held as merely a subset of the possible which is the basis of the Kantian revolution of metaphysics and logic in the Western tradition of philosophy. We work from what could be possible to what happened by necessity, so it is the subject that is determining the predicate. That is what I take Kant’s transcendental philosophy to represent in its entirety. Kant’s immediate contemporaries knew this and respected it! So what prevents us today from showing the same respect to one of the greatest philosophers of all times? I recommend Ernst Cassirer’s superb intellectual biography entitled, Kant’s Life and Work for this more expansive, organic reading.
