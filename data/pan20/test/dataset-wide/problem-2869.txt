From a basic psychoanalytic point of view, a la Melanie Klein, sadness is a regression to the depressive position that follows from the deflation of the infantile delusion of omnipotence -- the idea that things happen in the world just because we want them to. The idea is that we come into the world with no notion of desire or satisfaction. We reflexively behave as we naturally behave and we are occasionally satisfied. With no relation to others, we assume that good things happen just because we wan them hard enough. So whatever we want, we will be able to get it whenever we need it enough. We are omnipotent. At some point, we realize that there are independent causes of the things we want. We are crushed, because this presents the idea that there are things we need that we may simply never get. This is the point where we discover that our actions, primarily crying, do actually affect the actions of those external causes. This is our first sense of the basic notion of responsibility. We now have a reason to cry when we want to, and not to waste our resources otherwise. For Klein, sadness and grief are regressions to the state in which we have first learned when we want to cry and when we don't. Particularly the realization that further action on our part may not be effective. This would come to us in the state of having cried all we can manage and still not being satisfied or comforted enough to go to sleep. The idea that they evoke this very potent early memory explains both the feeling of exhaustion that accompanies them, and the fact their external emotional expression is to cry, but not energetically. (For brevity and continuity, I have skipped over the 'paranoid/schizoid' position here, during which we are omnipotent and contain the satisfying other, but face some kind of equally omnipotent thwarting other and there is no logic to life. But I need to admit her actual logic is not this compact.) 

We all have to admit there are no straight lines in the world. So what would it mean to say what one was, really, in terms of anything in the real world other than ourselves? That implies that from within mathematics, or from objective reality, you are never going to get any ideas about what is important about straight lines. You have to seek an answer from what makes us up: psychology and evolution. Mathematics is not about real things. It is about idealizations upon which human minds can generally be made to agree. Let me establish this perspective on mathematics a little. For a simpler example, let's back off to a number, say 5. You can show me sets of five things and say you have identified what five means, in the real world. But that does not explain how you can also have a length of five centimeters, because you will never be able to draw a line exactly five centimeters long, or cut a length into exactly five separate one-centimeter pieces. Nor could I tell if you did so. Even worse, try linking the five objects to an area of five square centimeters. It is only the fact that we can hook up those intuitions to one another via simple explanations that makes them all aspects of the same thing, the number 5. But as Socrates and the Pythagoreans had already demonstrated long ago, at base, those simple explanations make no sense unless you are already predisposed to understand them. That number is a bunch of very distinct things that fit together in your mind, and have a certain ideal quality. That area of five square centimeters is never exactly five square centimeters, after all. You just know what it would mean if it were. We know what a straight line is the ideal version of: a path that heads from one point to another as quickly as possible and extrapolates the result infinitely in both directions. And we know that it is not real, but a linguistic convention. But it is a very special sort of linguistic convention -- one that comes to humans exceptionally naturally. More naturally than real, observable things come to us when we really observe them. The very special thing about a straight line is that if you draw an approximation to it, another human being is strongly predisposed to actually perceive a better approximation than you drew. They might be tempted to correct your drawing, or if they copy it, they will draw a version that produces the intended figure in their head more properly than you managed in reality. So we have to admit that a straight line is a shared human habit, something to which our visual and explanatory mechanisms are drawn by our nature. (I would claim that these shared human habits are the real subject matter of mathematics.) People will do the same thing with a harmonized interval, or a catchy rhythmic figure. We can more easily get behind these and see the sensory simplifications that the "more proper" forms allow. They are more easily reproduced, because of the simpler waveforms we can sense through resonance in attempts to reproduce the harmonies, or the uses of inertia and muscle memory in the body that we can use to reproduce the rhythmic figures. I would propose that music and geometry have this in common, that we are drawn to seek ideal forms that are the easiest forms to mechanically repeat without tools. From that point of view, the straight line does have a clear definition: It is the ideal form of the drawn or otherwise impressed figure that is easiest for a human being to approximate without tools when copying it. The ideal form is straight because straightness involves solving an optimization problem, if we miss, we can improve our approximation by removing variation. If we fix it enough, we can always make it good enough to convey the right idea. No specific curve has that quality, for us. It is also not of a given length, because we can always be wrong about the length of a line, and we can fix that, too. But that is hard. So the perfect line would be one with no specific length. Conveniently, we have an optical mechanism with perspective, so we have the idea of "vanishing into infinity", to pack arbitrarily large visual spaces into finite representations. And we can imagine a line that would just vanish into infinity in both directions. I agree with Cort Ammon in principle, but I want to undercut his anthropocentrism. Yes, straight lines are useful and beautiful. But this compactness of representation is what makes the idea of a straight line useful to us, and that compactness is 'compact' because we are us. It is easy to imagine that some species might have chosen circles as the basic geometric figure, if they had the extreme symmetry of an octopus who might whip out a circle by drawing with all arms in concert -- or hyperbolas if they had a wormlike ability to stretch themselves out into arbitrarily long strands at a fixed rate. And these would lead to equally useful, very different perspectives that could just as firmly base science and engineering. 

Daniel Patrick Moynehan popularized the phrase "Defining Deviancy Down" for subtler versions of such cases. By simply never counting domestic violence, for instance, unless someone prosecuted, we can imagine we used to live in a much more peaceful world. By setting a higher bar on the degree of social cost, we used to have fewer Autistic people. In his usage, it was about the decision not to consider juvenile punishments to be criminal prosecutions, so it did not look like the incarceration rate was rising as fast as it really was. 

In a very literal sense, this is not true. Discussions of the ethics of sex go back to Cynicism, (with Diogenes the Cynic masturbating in public on purpose) and forward to at least Schopenhauer and to psychoanalytic branches like Lacan. (Though still, much of this is about what is normal, and dispelling unconsidered condemnation, rather than about actual ethical reasons for actual sexual acts.) Critical Theory incorporates forms of feminism that involve strong attempts at analysing the ethics of sex.(Detour to advertise Starhawk and other "informal Critical Theorists", who make a definite point of not excluding sex as motivation, test case or general theoretical source material for her political/ethical positions.) But in every other way, it is overbearingly obvious. Philosophy in the West after the Classical Period was hemmed in tightly by attempts not to contradict Christianity, and we still face direct refusals of students to even read the material on the basis of religious orthodoxy. So, much of this material gets very narrow circulation and little critical attention. (And therefore, much of it is absolutely awful, or hard to plough through as it comes couched in impenetrable framings for sheer self-defense of the author.) (I will not go back and edit that for overly-allusive language... I just.will.not...) And sex is still something over which our society is deeply divided. Older concessions to the animal nature of sex, and the traditional disparity that places on the genders attracts more attention as soon as the subject arises in a critical forum than basic ethical treatment of sex itself as a real source of issues. You stop discussing sex and begin discussing gender- or oppression-based politics. Further, as a general failing of ethics, we are too often looking at two extreme ends of a continuum of generality. Those at one end are obsessed with general principles, which will, of course, apply to sex as well as to anything else, which lets them ignore it without seeming to. And those at the other end cannot place judgement unless they are willing to go to a level of detail that most of us would find embarrassing to read. Since Critical Theory, which tries to include both Freud and Feminism, aw well as Marx, this is slowly improving, as one cannot really 'feel' the problems of feminism or the male equivalent (which is usually some anti-hierarchical pacifism) without thinking through the crazy reduction of sex and violence to economic terms. To pick a given framing that is not afraid of sex, I would point you at Starhawk's Truth or Dare, which is excessively political, but has that politics based in a pro-bisexual pacifist psychoanalytic reorientation of Marxist-feminism, and, despite that, can still be read. (Sorry to be repetitive, but she is really worth it.) 

I like the interpretation of this position given by Sextus Empiricus: That the best approach to knowledge is to continually set aside one's concern for whether or not something is true. Thus it is not just belief replacing certainty, it is continual avoidance of belief, and seeking to hold all opinions in appropriate perspective. I think it is likely to be what Socrates and the Cynics had in mind when they said the wisest man was the one who knew nothing, because believing something wrong was worse than being ignorant. Of course, this, like many other Golden Mean interpretations is a self-contradictory position, if you believe it. Moderation in all things but moderation, tolerance of everything but intolerance, etc. But it escapes this paradox in practice, because if you apply it to itself, you don't really believe it, and it does not bother you to act upon it. 

This is exactly what mathematicians call "a logic". Two propositions are equivalent in a given logic if when all the variables are appropriately filled in, they always define the same set of things. Two things are the same according to a given logic if they satisfy all of the same propositions. Most people think of standard first-order logic, where all variables are able to take all values and all true propositions are equal and the rest (the false propositions) are also equal. But if you want to study something more like human thought than Platonic definitions, you have more subtle rules. So there is not really a definition for 'similarity' across the whole of philosophy, but there is a recognition that studying different notions of similarity is important enough to constitute an entire subfield. From a modern formalist mathematical point of view, this study of logics is the whole of mathematics. So some philosophers consider that subfield larger or smaller depending on their ontology. 

The only approach to modality available in any standard First (or Higher-) Order Logic is the approach that attaches an entire theory with a complete axiomatization for every model of every mood. To discuss, for instance Aristotle's famous naval battle argument, we would need to define an entire system of terms that encompass all of the rules and considerations about what 'must' and 'might' mean in an Aristotelian context. You can add symbols for 'qualifiers' like the quantifiers that represent the modality. People do it, and it remains a standard logic with a few extra rules about 'box' and 'diamond' operators. For given moral moods or moods of desire, belief, etc, you can start from the box/diamond rules and extend them to handle the extra parameters. These have first-order instantiations by models. For any given mood, the odds are this cannot be done at all in only first-order terms. So then this whole consideration would have to be thrown out, if you want to tick to FOL as your entire logical theory. But standard higher-order logic is necessary for a lot of things, including real arithmetic. But this is not a particularly tractable way of addressing the problem. It is very hard to work out the axioms, in a way that would reflect normal usage, without examples. And examples can really only be had by falling back onto a model theory, involving some ad-hoc variant of the possible worlds perspective. You need some notions of 'what-if-scenario', and how scenarios are and are not seen to be compatible with the same sets of facts. Kripke's insight was basically "Why not start from a version that is common, and not ad-hoc?" So he injected one very basic modality (possibility) into set theory itself, and found that most variant modalities can be modeled in the resulting enriched world. 

You can look at the whole of topology as an investigation of the class of related propositions like 'within', 'in' and 'on'. The notion of open and closed sets captures the distinction between within and on, and together we get in. Notions of continuity, compactness, etc. elaborate intuitions about what happens to boundaries and interiors when they are looked at in different ways. Likewise, lattice theory captures 'over' and 'under', etc. So I would consider this support for your Claim. But I would point out that if one large subtopic in mathematics, captures just three prepositions, and one of the most overloaded classes of notational conveniences captures just one other pair, this approach may be unproductively complicated to pursue. 

Neitzsche explicitly said (in longer terms) "Stay sheltered, to remain free. Put three centuries between yourself and current affairs. Do not know who is on which side of what war." So the idea he would care about what wing you are on politically is kind of ludicrous. Left vs Right is about an approach to history, so it shifts over time, and it is not really theoretically sound. Therefore it is not a thing that really applies to any morality that attempts to be trans-historical. This goes double for Nietzsche. At the same time you see him as 'leftist' because of his 'relativism', Nietzsche put a great deal of weight on decent taste and on a certain sort of honor that can only really exist in a 'master' society, one that does not consider everyone anywhere close to equal. (Fascism and the alt-right latch on to this and ignore the whole context.) He explicitly disparaged the Christian leaning toward helping and supporting everyone -- the thing that currently makes the Left the Left, at least currently, in the U.S. He explicitly despised helping people whose problems you have not experienced first hand, or at least come to know through close friendships -- a standard criticism of the 'elite' Left and our current welfare state, which the actual long-term poor often vote against. Also, moral relativism exists in the form it currently has in order to hold 'the herd' together, in the form of multicultural democracy. It is the new Christianity, a new dominant religion. And it still encourages submission -- only submission to something more objective and less precise. So he would probably absolutely despise most of the modern Left (three hundred years from now, of course.) Perspectivism is not relativism because it does not encourage compromise and acceptance. It encourages a sort of intellectual domination, enfolding others' worlds into your own entirely, while maintaining your own position. You are not supposed to temper the idea you are right, you are just supposed to understand everyone else enough to know why you are right. His succession of Creators do not accommodate variant traditions in a broadly multicultural way, they advance totally contrary values in a way that controls and dominates them. Christianity does not remain Jewish... Judaism did not abide the cult of Baal... This approach to reality is far closer to modern Evangelicalism than it is to any liberal or even most Socialist views.
