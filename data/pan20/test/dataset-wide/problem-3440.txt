As you say (how did $\sin t$ in the initial problem become $\cos t$?), $\mathbb{Q}$ is a measure under which $W_t$ becomes $\tilde{W}_t - \sin t$, where $\tilde{W}_t$ is a $\mathbb{Q}$-Brownian motion. So Girsanov's theorem would say $$ L_t = E[\frac{ d \mathbb{Q} }{ d \mathbb{P} }|\mathcal{F}_t] = e^{ - \int_0^t \sin s dW_s - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t \sin^2 s ds} $$ is one such measure. As for uniqueness, if we take $\Omega$ to be the canonical path space $C[0, T]$ with $\mathcal{F}$ generated by the cylinder sets. Then the Wiener measure would be unique, simply by the fact that the Brownian law says any two such measures must agree on the cylinder sets and therefore all of $\mathcal{F}$. In general, the Girsanov $\mathbb{Q}$ is unique up to the Brownian filtration $\mathcal{F}_{W} \subset \mathcal{F}$, since it is constructed $W$-pathwise. 

Identifying assumption: assumptions made about the DGP that allows you to draw causal inference. E.g. exogeneity assumption for IV, parallel trends assumption in diff-in-diff. Identifying assumptions (lack of endogeneity in general) can never be statistically confirmed (a non-reject is good, but it's not confirmation). So assessment of plausibility consists of empirical arguments based on what you know about the DGP. 

I realize this question might be too old to reply to, but it was just bumped to the homepage. But anyway: I think other answers might be missing the forest for the trees a bit. Most basic economic models could be defined with either "stocks" or "flows" as you've defined them. Ultimately, it's about measuring productivity in a generalized production function. You can define the inputs however you'd like- labor could be defined in "full time employee equivalents," or "hours worked," or a vareity of other things. Capital, as many other answers have noted, is incredibly hard to pin down in some cases. That said, it can often be defined and measured through depreciation, investment, "hours of machine X used," "number of tractors used," etc.. More generally, both are pinned down by their relative factor income shares: an early estimation of which led to the creation of the Cobb-Douglas Production Function, which is an instructive example. For that, you define labor as the number of person hours worked (so if you worked for two companies, four hours each, it would count as 8 total "units" of labor), and capital as the total value of all machinery, buildings, equipment, etc.. You then look at how productive resources are allocated between the two, and back out income shares. For this, you never needed to really touch the "stock vs flow" issue, you just had to make sure your definitions were consistent. 

More of a comment: There should be an expectation operator in the statement of the problem, otherwise problem doesn't make sense. That "...the deterministic and stochastic value function must be the same..." is not quite right. The value of $\sigma^2$ is crucial in the restriction \begin{align} \rho = \left(-n + \sigma^2\left(1 - \frac{\alpha\gamma}{2}\right)\right)(1-\alpha\gamma). \end{align} If $\sigma^2 = 0$, then presumably $\rho < 0$ for economically reasonable $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, in which case the deterministic problem may be ill-posed. What is true is that the stochastic value function takes the given form only if the parameter restriction holds. Factoring out the Ito term $\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2$ from the right hand side $$ \sigma^2\left(1 - \frac{\alpha\gamma}{2}\right) (1-\alpha\gamma), $$ the restriction can be written as $$ \rho + n (1-\alpha\gamma) = \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 [ (1-\alpha\gamma) - (-\left(1 - \alpha\gamma\right)^2)]. $$ On the right hand side, we have a elasticity of intertemporal substitution term $(1-\alpha\gamma)$ and a risk aversion term $-\left(1 - \alpha\gamma\right)^2$. What the restriction says is that, with a particular choice of $\sigma$, they offset each other, up to time preference $\rho$ and the drift $n(1 - \alpha\gamma)$. Therefore the value function is independent of $\sigma$. That the value function is independent of $\sigma$ is an artifact of the restriction, and choice of CRRA $u$. Not true in general. 

There is a broad literature that attempts to address the very question you pose- what is the impact of immigration (legal and illegal) on native wages? However, if you're interested in the 'real world' evidence, I'd suggest focusing on empirical labor economics as opposed to more theoretical labor models. The reason for my suggestion is that theoretical economics makes no clear prediction without a lot more information. There are a variety of factors, such as the production function being considered, the labor market conditions observed, the relative substitutability of immigrant and native workers, etc. which tends to make answering the question more of an empirical exercise. As far as the findings of the empirical papers, they actually tend to find relatively little impact of immigrant labor on native wages, with a few notable exceptions. For some examples: This survey paper, though a bit out of date as it's from 2005 outlines the results of 18 papers and finds wide discrepancies depending on modeling techniques and underlying assumptions used. Borjas, 2003 is one of the better known works, and finds what one might expect based on Econ101 models- that an increase in immigrant labor supply leads to a decrease in wages for native workers. A couple very well known articles have tried to tease out the impact of immigration on wages by focusing on particular events (called supply shocks) where the number of immigrants increased "suddenly" for reasons having nothing to do with the economic climate at the time. A pair of papers examined the impact of the Mariel Boatlift, which led to a spike in Cuban immigrants in Miami: The first, a paper by Card 1990 found no evidence of a negative impact of immigration on wages, while Borjas 2015 finds a substantial decrease in the wages for the least educated Miami residents. Several other papers have found either no negative effect, or even positive effects, of immigrants on various worker wages. For example, this paper by Peri in 2011 finds no negative impact of immigrants on wages, but a strongly positive impact of immigrants on productivity. This paper from 2013 finds significant positive impacts of undocumented immigrants on the wages of native workers in Georgia. Ultimately, the exercise of determining the impact of immigrants on wages really depends on the method of analysis and a number of underlying parameters, and applying "standard" (i.e. Principles of Micro) models can lead to erroneous results and a false sense of certainty. If there's anything else in particular you're interested in, let me know and I'll try to improve the answer! EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to include a link to this additional survey paper in the original answer! 

For a nice, and gentle, functional analytic treatment on this, see the chapter on welfare theorems in Stokey and Lucas. (Although what they call "inner product" is definitely not standard functional analytic language. That term is reserved strictly for Hilbert spaces in functional analysis.) Prices are elements of the dual as you and previous answer stated. Where one needs to be more careful in the general setting is specifying a topology. You want the value of bundles to be continuous---hence prices are continuous (i.e. bounded, if the commodity space is Banach) with respect to the topology chosen on the commodity space. 

Economics models usually assume that the structure of the economy is common knowledge among agents. Mathematically, an event is common knowledge if it lies in the meet of all agents' information sets. (The meet of a family of $\sigma$-algebras is the finest common coarsification of all $\sigma$-algebras in the family. See Aumann 1976.) However, in the literature when a paper makes the common knowledge assumption, one almost never sees the meet of any information sets anywhere. Let me give an example (Grossman and Stiglitz 1980). Grossman-Stiglitz model This is a model where two traders with (essentially) mean-variance utility are asymmetrically informed about the mean. By assumption, structure of the economy is common knowledge and traders are rational. Equilibrium price must therefore, first, clear the market and, second, be consistent with the uninformed trader's expectation. Details given as follows. Let $I$ and $U$ denote the informed and uninformed traders respectively. The traders have same CARA utility, $u_I(W) = u_U(W) = - e^{-\gamma W}$. The risk-free rate is $r$. The price of risky asset tomorrow is $P_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{P}, \sigma^2) | \bar{P}$. The informed trader $I$ knows $\bar{P}$; the uninformed trader $U$ only knows the prior distribution $\bar{P} \sim \mathcal{N}(P_0, \sigma_0^2)$. Let both trader have wealth endowments $E$. (CARA utility has no wealth effect, so $E$ plays no role in portfolio choice below.) Given today's price $P_1$ for the risky asset, trader's wealth tomorrow is $W(\phi) = rW + \phi (P_2 - rP_1)$ if he choose to hold $\phi$ units of risky asset. Maximizing expected utility, a traders' demand is $$ \frac{E[P_2|\mathcal{F}] - rP_1}{\gamma Var(P_2|\mathcal{F})} $$ conditional on his information set $\mathcal{F}$. For $I$, $\mathcal{F}_I = \{ \bar{P}, P_1\} $. For $U$, $\mathcal{F}_U = \{ P_1 \}$. The supply $x$ of risky asset is distributed $\mathcal{N}(\bar{x}, \sigma_x^2)$. Equilibrium is a price function $P_1(\bar{P}, x)$ such that $$ \frac{\bar{P} - r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma \sigma^2}+ \frac{E[P_2|P_1(\bar{P}, x)] - r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma Var(P_2|P_1(\bar{P}, x))} = x. $$ In other words, market clears and the uninformed trader computes his demand using the correct pricing function in equilibrium. Now in this CARA-normal setting, things are linear and one can solve for equilibrium by guessing a pricing function $$ P_1(\bar{P}, x) = A\bar{P} + Bx + C $$ and find $A$, $B$ and $C$ by matching coefficients. For example, compute $$ E[P_2|P_1] = P_0 + \frac{A \sigma_0^2}{A^2 \sigma_0^2 + B^2 \sigma_x^2} [A(\bar{P} - P_0) + Bx] $$ and $$ Var(P_2|P_1) = \frac{B^2 \sigma_x^2}{A^2 \sigma_0^2 + B^2 \sigma_x^2}\sigma_0^2 + \sigma^2 $$ Substituting into the market clearing equation and some tedious algebra gives endogenous constants $A$, $B$, and $C$. Instead, Grossman and Stiglitz do something more elegant. They point out that uninformed trader $U$ can condition on the residual demand for any realization of $(\bar{P},x)$ $$ D_{resid} = x - \frac{\bar{P} - r P_1 }{\gamma \sigma^2}. $$ What's even more clever, they note that, since $P_1$ is observed in in equilibrium, they first conjecture that $P_1$ and $$ \tilde{D}_{resid} = x - \frac{\bar{P} }{\gamma \sigma^2}. $$ are informationally equivalent. Then equilibrium condition becomes $$ \frac{ r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma \sigma^2}+ \frac{E[P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid}] - r P_1(\bar{P}, x)}{\gamma Var(P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid})} = \tilde{D}_{resid}. $$ Now things are much less tedious and there are no endogenous constants $A$ and $B$ to solve for. $E[P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid}]$ is an affine function of $\tilde{D}_{resid}$ and $Var(P_2|\tilde{D}_{resid})$ is an exogenous constant. So that $P_1(\bar{P}, x)$ can be backed out immediately. Since $P_1$ is an affine function of $\tilde{D}_{resid}$, it is verified ex-post that they are informationally equivalent. Question To have the uninformed trader $U$ condition on the residual demand, the common knowledge assumption is used. Or, at least, $U$ knows that $I$ knows so that $U$ can put herself in $I$'s shoes and compute $I$'s demand. However, the meet of the information sets does not appear anywhere---as it should. Result of $U$'s calculations should be measurable with respect to the meet. If one is to formulate this mathematically, where would that appear? 

There are a few reasons why, at least in a broader theoretical context, substantial government influence in a market economy may have negative consequences. A few are: Crowding Out Effect Increases in government spending can potentially lead to a decrease in investment from the private sector. This can be thought of in the more formal definition of the term (that an increase in government demands for loanable funds can lead to an increase in the interest rates faced by the private sector) or in the more informal one- that government involvement can change the profit motive faced by private entities in the field. If you assume that those private firms are, on balance, more efficient with resources than the governmental agency, it can lead to negative economic outcomes. Market Distortions One potential problem of increased governmental activity in the economy comes from unforeseen distortions that can ripple through other sectors. For all their problems, one nice feature of market equilibria are their ability to reflect private information and demands, and aggregate the individual actions of hundreds of millions of people effectively. That is no small feat; it is hard for a centralized agency to mimic that effectiveness. One of the major problems with centralized economies in practice is their practical inability to allocate resources "efficiently." Modeling government interaction in a repeated game-like context. Another (albeit more philosophical) problem some see is that, even if a larger government would be optimal for right now, it is often difficult to cut bureaucracy once it becomes entrenched. Therefore, we should consider that "future value" of inefficiently large government spending in the future (even if it is optimal to increase government's size today) into today's perceived "payoffs" of different actions. Problems with the Multiplier Effect: The multiplier, as learned in econ101, is a bit oversimplified in its presentation. While there almost certainly is some multiplier in every case, it isn't really just a single number that turns on an economy wide "marginal propensity to consume." Instead, it's far more subtle, and often depends on who is receiving the benefit, what the context of the payment is, etc. Furthermore, some conservative economists argue it is often too small to justify the expense. Now, note that I personally don't really believe much of what was said above. I'm not trying to suggest that Mr. Corbyn should or shouldn't increase the size of government expenditures (I haven't studied the issue enough to make an informed opinion). Furthermore, I think it should be noted (in the interest of fairness) that many times these theoretical concerns can be misapplied in practice: for example, The Laffer Curve may be the most poorly applied theoretical concept in political economy. Let me know if that didn't answer your question, or if you'd like more detail!
