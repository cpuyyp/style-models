Here is another way of looking at this. The statement X if and only if Y expresses the logical equivalence of X and Y and is written X &iff; Y. This is the conjuction of the two conditionals X ⇒ Y and Y ⇒ X. The "if" conjunct corresponds to Y ⇒ X and the "only if" conjuct corresponds to X ⇒ Y. It should be obvious then, that the statement "if P then Q" is not equivalent to "Q only if P". 

Philosophically, hearsay that is meant literally - i.e., not rhetorically, playfully, figuratively, ironically, etc. - is normally referred to as testimony. Whether the testimony included in news coverage is meant to be taken literally is not clear even if it is clear that many viewers do take it literally. I believe that David Hume's considerations of the epistemological validity of testimony is among the earliest philosophical treatments. See Of Miracles from his An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding (1748). Unsurprisingly, Hume wrote that testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the facts themselves are not credible. The SEP includes an interesting article on the subject : Epistemological Problems of Testimony. The article identifies three features of testimony which indicate the wide scope of the problem of its epistemological justification. Most relevant here is : 

Brouwer formulates his foundational philosophy using a single a priori notion, that of time; expressing the kernel of his idea thus : 

Jobermark's answer makes correct points, and I am not really qualified to talk about the properties of electrons, but a lack of qualification has never stopped me in the past, so here goes : As you have pointed out in stating your question, the apparent fact that all electrons share the same fundamental properties makes it problematic to distinguish between two electrons based on their fundamental properties alone. Another problem with identifying electrons with their fundamental properties is the possibility that these properties may vary over time. For example, according to astronomical measurement and the Standard Model, the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for "at least" half the age of the universe - implying that the Standard Model allows for the possibility of a change in electron mass over time. This brings us to the more logical-philosophical issue of identity, properties, and change (over time). Am I the same person when I am wearing reading glasses as when I am not? I'd like to think so. Consider Heraclitus famous declaration : No man ever steps into the same river twice. Arguments like these have often appeared in the history of philosophy, but it is now generally agreed by logicians that they are mistaken and rest on a simple ambiguity. 

I am reading Adrian Bardon’s recent text, A History of the Philosophy of Time, and in it he makes the following passing comment : 

Using the method of proving the contrapositive,can you explain the reasoning behind how we are able to show that p is false by assuming q is false without use of the truth table? Or is that what is being used to establish this? 

Libet himself concluded that our awareness of decision making appears to be an illusion, that consciousness is "out of the loop". This appears to be different than denying free will. We are conscious of the need to make a decision but we are not necessarily conscious of how that decision is made. The neuroscientist Vilayanur Ramachandran, gives an interesting take on Libet's results: 

I read the quoted text so that the author is not questioning whether one fact can be deduced from the other. The author is asking : 

Firstly, in a strictly formal setting, we note that Gödel's first incompleteness theorem tells us that truth is not reducible to proof, so there are many truths which are not derivable. In a formal setting, we chose our axioms because we believe them to be self-evident truths - i.e., true for no (logical) reason. But why do we assume that only self-evident truths are not derivable. More generally, beyond the formality of mathematics, if one accepts that nature includes random processes, then such processes may provide examples of brute facts which are true simply because they are true and for no other (logical) reason. For example, if one accepts that the human evolutionary process is driven by random mutations of our genetic material, then we are who and what we are for no logical reason. It is true that humans exist on planet Earth, but it is not a logical necessity and it could have been otherwise. Regarding true statements that contradict logic, one might argue that quantum superpositioning may provide examples. Superpositioning is a phenomenon that is supported by experimental evidence, but it certainly appears to be illogical to assert that a particle can be simultaneously in two different states or two different locations. Having said that, it may follow logically from the formalism of quantum theory that superpositioning is a logical necessity. I'm not a physicist, so I'm not entirely sure. 

Modern science does NOT say that everything has a cause. Indeed, it appears to say the opposite. Quantum theory implies that events can occur for no reason what so ever. At least from a purely scientific point of view, causality breaks down at the level of the "very small". So from a scientific point of view, not every event has a cause. Similarily, from a logical point of view, not every truth has a reason for being true. 

ORIGINAL ANSWER According to Graham Priest, McTaggart argued that the notion of past and future and inherently contradictory, and then concluded that there can be no time. When McTaggart attempts to eliminate this contradiction, he gives rise to an infinite regress. For the sake of completeness, we will look at the contraction, the infinite regress, and the resolution. If you are already familiar with McTaggart's argument, then please skip to the second section, below. (That probably means you, OP.) First, let's look at why McTaggart claims that the notions of past and future are contradictory. Let us write P for "it was the case that", and write F for "it will be the case that" - i.e., P for past, F for future. So, for example, if e is some instantaneous event, then we write P(e) to express that "it was the case that e", and similarly for F. Note that e is an instantaneous event - for example, e could denote the moment I click on the "Post Your Answer" button when posting this answer. Now, let h denote the statement "e is occuring". Then we have : 

We now resolve this infinite regress. We begin by noting that every situation s(0) comes together with a set of other situations - situations which are either before or after s(0). Assuming that time is one dimensional, we can represent these situations thus: 

I'm not an expert in this area, so someone may wish to correct me. Since you appear to be wishing to look at this formally, let's start with a formal view of the problem. In a formal setting, a statement P is called not decidable if it is impossible to prove P and it is impossible to prove not(P). Note that provability is a purely syntactic notion here. On the other hand, truth is a semantic notion, and we say that a statement is true in a formal system if it is provable; in other words, we say a statement is true if it is a theorem. With this in mind we can restate your statement P1 as : 

Both of these methods work by assuming the relevant truth values. In the case of proving the contrapositive, we assume that q is false and show that this forces us to accept that p must also be false. Here is an example of a proving the contrapositive : (note: I shall give an example of an informal argument since it will be easier to follow how the methods work.) EXAMPLE : Suppose n is a positive integer and that we wish to prove that : 

Now lets consider what we wish to prove. We wish to show : if V then not(X). It is enough to show that if V is true, then not(X) must be true. Assume V. Then by P1 we have W. By your own reasoning restated above, we know not(W) or not(X) is true. But since W is true, this means that not(X) must be true. Therefore, if V then not(X). It should be easy for you to formalise this argument. 

Later philosophers have characterised Hegel's method as the thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad. It is this method that Hegel used to develop his philosophical theories. Finally, here is an image illustrating the relative demands of understanding Hegel's philosophy : 

People who hold this view, such as Susan Blackmore, argue as follows : Whenever I ask myself "Am I conscious?" the answer will always be "yes". Since we always answer "yes" we leap to the conclusion that we are always conscious. But what about those times when I am not asking myself this question. Here, the argument is that when we are not asking ourselves this question, there are no contents of consciousness and no-one to experience them. The brain simply carries on doing multiple things in parallel, as in Dennett's multiple drafts theory, and none of what the brain is doing is either in consciousness or out of consciousness. The next time we ask "Am I conscious?", a now, a stream of experiences, and a self who observes them all appear together, but a moment later they are gone. And again, the next time you ask, a new self and a new world are all concocted. If you then conclude that you are always conscious by relying on metaphors such a streams, theatres, and spotlights, then you only dig yourself deeper into this confusion. Thus, the conclusion they draw is that consciousness is a delusion.
