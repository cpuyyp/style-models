The Quasi War was from 1798 to 1800. Hamilton is famous for promoting a strong Federal government and it's credit worthiness a decade prior to the Quasi War. Hamilton's famous proposal towards this goal was to have the federal government assume (or rather reassume) the Revolutionary War debts from the States (mostly that of the North). The Hamilton, Jefferson compromise had the Federal Government assuming the revolutionary war debt was concluded July 16th, 1790. Hamilton primary goal in having the United States Federal Government to assume and pay off the revolutionary war debt, had to do with credit worthiness, business and carving out a role for the Federal Government. The revolutionary war debts at the time resided with individual states not the Federal Government. Many of those states especially in the North had not been in a position to service those debts due to their own post war economic troubles. What Hamilton wanted to do was to have the Federal Government assume these debts. The problem was southern states like Virginia were wealthy enough to have paid off most of their assigned war debt prior to Hamilton's proposed deal and thus they didn't have much incentive to have the federal government assume the war debt of Northern States like New York and Massachusetts. The famous bargain struck by Hamilton from NY and Jefferson from Va which allowed the Federal Government to assume this largely Northern held debt moved the nations capital from Philadelphia to the South. Washington DC on lands granted by both Virginia and Maryland, two southern states below the Mason Dixon line. Hamilton's motivation was he wanted the United States to be credit worthy. To be a great trading nation you had to be able to borrow money, and have established credit. The best way to establish the credit worthiness of the new nation was to assume the debt of the States and then to make good on that debt becoming trustworthy to European creditors. Hamilton wanted one central (Federal) authority with the power to secure it's own revenue granted under the Constitution to be in charge of this national debt/credit. Jefferson and Southern leaders vocally opposed the strong federal authority opting rather for a decentralized plan where each state was more autonomous and acted together only when they were all in agreement. Jefferson and his southern allies proved more interested in capturing the capital there by elevating the South in the Union. Sources: 

Fitting to your understanding, the stated purposes of Finland's involvement with Germany in the Siege of Leningrad was to regain lost lands from the Winter's War. To this end, they didn't participate in the direct siege far beyond the pre-war border, by Mannenheim's orders. However, they did aid the Germans in blockading Russia's supply routes. Had peace been struck between the Finnish and the Russians, there may have not only been more open supply routes (which would have severely helped), but parts of the German attack route may have even been cut off. Whether or not the Finnish leadership would have found such a face heel turn prudent with the German army already marching by is another matter. $URL$ 

313 AD was a data point on a long line of fascination with Christianity for Constantine. Constantine's interest in Christianity wasn't wealth, it was marshal. Constantine came to power by defeating rival roman emperors by rallying Christians to his cause. He as many Romans had witnessed Christians going to their deaths across the empire singing and rejoicing; and Constantine had thought to himself.. If I had a few legions of those guys I could deal with the fractured empires troubles. So Constantine began to recruit Christians for his army. The battle of Milvian Bridge also 312 AD, is an example of Constantine use of Christians as his warriors. Fighting under a Christian cross, and giving all credit for the victory to the Christian God, and representing himself as the chosen one of God to lead the empire. Only Constantine was still a Pagan when he did all these things. The flaw in Constantine's plan was that before he could use christianity to unity his empire; first Constantine had to unify the Christian churches. He had to create a unified Church a catholic Church. The problem was in 325 AD christianity was a series of loosely affiliated underground religions which had survived for centuries of Roman persecution. Christians were put to death across the empire as they were discovered, so christians had become skilled at hiding. This hiding didn't allow the free flow of ideas. Christianity was thus a fractured religion made up of many different beliefs, each city lead by a bishop with his own doctrine which may or may not agree with the bishop who had set up shop just over the horizon in the next city. These bishops traditions and doctrines had evolved independently as their was no authority and limited contact with other branches of christianity. So Constantine couldn't use christianity to unit the empire until he united christianity. On this note, the pagan Constantine the Great called the first christian church council, the council of Nicea. Nicea being a suburb of Constantinople, Constantine's capital. He called the bishops of christianity to him. He personally presided over this council, and personally set the agenda... What he wanted and what he got was a unifying statement of belief that would unite all the different churches into one united catholic Church.. catholic meaning unified and being written into the creed. That statement generated at Nicea is today the Nicea creed which remains the most widely used christian profession of beliefs across Catholicism and much of the Protestant churches. I've even heard the Mormons use it. Among Constantine's other innovations was the use of Christian relics. Body parts of martyrs or saints or even items which had come in contact with Christ himself. Constantine collected these totems and used them to court favor from christian leaders, or demonstrate his great knowledge / wisdom about christianity. This was the start of centuries of fascination with relics by the christian church which would only be curbed by Martin Luther's reforms. 

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1964 outlawed various forms of discrimation, although what they outlawed were mostly State laws it's hard to say if this is what you are looking for; since you don't make a distinction on what laws Congress has repealed. Most notably, around the same time in 1973 Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, this measure replaced the 1964 Tonkin Gulf Resolution which in effect repealed it. As noted by jfrankcarr many existing Acts were repealed by further acts, in general Congress amends laws, it's rare for them to be repealed, but in many cases as well the Executive Branch (the President) just doesn't enforce laws that either it doesn't agree with or doesn't think are effective any more. As an aside Anti-Miscenigation laws were repealed, on a State level, but on a Federal level were never able to be enacted - although this was attempted these attempts were for Amendments to be added so that Anti-Miscenigation laws would be law of the land. Never happened though. You can find out more here: how to repeal a law 

The United States would fight two wars with the Barbary Pirates. What was the long term ramifications of the United States tussle with the Barbary Pirates? Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans recognized the worth of a standing professional navy. Lots of tribute paid in the mean while. A great origin story of how we went from paying tribute to armed struggle. It wasn't a foreign policy derived in Washington but involving one of the really heroic block heads of American History... William Eaton. Eaton had run away from home at 16 to join the colonial army. He had risen to officer under Washington. Had made and lost a fortune. He had been a spy master for President Adams who had helped thwart a Spanish invasion of Georgia. Now Adams would send William Eaton a "Man of Action" on a diplomatic mission to Tunisia, to the Barbary Pirates where he would get in all sorts of trouble. 

I got this from the House of Representatives site noted below, and they give a little more on the tradition and how this was originally done by Junior Members, some who were the first's such as the first female Representatives from a state, first Asian-American woman who was the Representative from Hawaii.

The US does provide money abroad for humanitarian reasons, although I am sure some money can go through certain channels (or agencies) and find it's way to foreign political parties that are pro-US. This is certainly the case with governments which receive funds from the US in order to keep the party in power, or certainly influence a pro-US point of view. It happens, has happened and in many ways is legal as it's money spent under Foreign Aid, although it is becoming a political topic now that the US is heading into elections and our budget can't readily support such subsidies. If there are political parties being given money I don't know, but it probably happens and in many cases is probably done so it's untracable. Political parties in power in the US do give money to support parts of their agenda, the most recent example I can think of is the Bush Administration stopped giving aid money to organizations that promoted abortion. There are controversies, but many either blow over when a scandal comes up, or a new Administration comes to power and then reverts any foreign aid assistance guidelines imposed by the previous administration. 

Treatment of snipers varied by country and time. The Germans and British both mixed solo snipers and snipers in squads (both dedicated and mixed). American snipers were poorly trained due to their quick deployment times and a lack of camouflage instruction. $URL$ 

Unfortunately, I had trouble finding a source of evidence to link to you for this, but I recall that, in a high school US History class, we watched a documentary on the death penalty, and it covered the history of it. There were some hand-painted signs advertising the killing of a known convict, but I can't recall what period they were from. That said, the art looked to be from the early 20th century. While I could not find this for you, I do recall the gist of the documentary. The killing of convicts was used for entertainment longer than the USA has been in existence. This ties into the same cultures which used to hold picnics in graveyards. People were generally more morbid about life, likely due to their average lives involving death (remember, most people were famers or hunters and death rates were much higher until only recently thanks to the advent of modern medicine), and this likely carried on well through this age; indeed, it only seems to have decreased following WWII, likely due to three generations in a row being exposed to mass casualties. With later research, I did find two sources which may be on interest, however; pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/execution/readings/… is a fairly good source. It mentions Eva Dugan, whose execution was public (and publicly botched), wherein a wikipedia search leads to a historical account in content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,738741,00.html which, sadly, requires subscribing to view 

This was after a fight to get the capital either in Philadelphia or New York City, and it was set to move from time to time as part of a deal with the Continental Congress. Yet in Federalist number 43 Madison argues that the capital needs to be on its own land, which eventually won out. Its often been said the city is built on swampland that no one really wanted, and think of the symbolism of that all you want. It was made to be the capital so it naturally became the power center and dominated US politics by its nature and creation. It's influence has basically been retained over time, though even the Federalists and Anti-Federalists have fought over governments power and reach the capital has been and continues to be the center of politics as it maintains the Federal Bueracracy and Cabinet offices, as well as very close by the Pentagon which is the military headquarters of the US military branches. Note: I may clean this up later but this should give you an idea of the background. Other Sources: Founding of Washington DC Wikipedia's Version 

The reasoning doesn't seem to be recorded in my source, $URL$ Evidently the session was a special case, as this is only recorded once, and references to the doors being closed are present in the speeches covered in the source. 

The takeover of India, creating the British Raj, was the first step to controlling India. After the 1857 uprising, the British rewarded those who had not joined in the rebellion. 

and created the Government of India Act 1919 to try to appease the Indians with a diarchy. In WWII, the Cripps Mission was launched and failed as well. 

The Maya did: $URL$ , in most cases this seemed to be more extaordinary and in a way of trying to get the attention of the gods in extreme circumstances, such as famine, flood or alternately kings ascending the throne. As did the Aztec: $URL$ , although I have never seem much in the way of explanation other than some considered it an honor to be sacrificed. Depending on how you view the sacrifice witch burning could be another, this was religious and a punishment but again it depends on how you define it.
