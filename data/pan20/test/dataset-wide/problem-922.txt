The optimal search path is to start in the black circle and follow the black line. Supposedly, this will help you find him as quick as possible. A few other tips that I used: 

It came from personal experience While he didn't die, he once got repeatedly stung by a bunch of yellowjackets. The TombQuest Wiki says this about the matter: 

However another good reading order, and IMO the better one, would be as follows (again main novels in bold, and note that I've jumbled short stories, novellas etc. under one title 'short story'): 

I have been looking for significance for the rest of the book, though as yet, haven't written anything up. There have been several sites suggesting that the South represents 'Heaven' and the North 'Hell' - During his time in the hospital he suffers badly and is always wishing that he could return south to his home. Other sites also say he dreamed up a heroic death for himself, perhaps how he may have wanted to die, in the south, while in fact he dies on the operating table. This may be Borges thinking about what could have happened to himself had things gone different. Sources: 

EDIT After some comments, I'm going to clarify and expand on a couple of different contexts. If all the audience know the character If the audience definitely knows the character (e.g. If someone goes to a book meeting after everyone's read a book) then you can probably just quote the character. The audience will know they are a fictional person. If you are quoting multiple times The first time I would go with character, book, author. After that, the reader will know that the character isn't real, and you can just quote the character. If the character is used as the author's 'mouthpiece' Sometimes authors write a sort of biography, but use a character instead of themselves. In this case, and if you have to be absolutely sure this is the case, it would probably be best to quote the author, as that is their thought, not the character's. In all other situations Include all the information, author, character and book. If one person doesn't know the character is fictional, then you need to include all information, at least the first time. Sources, and examples of sites that agree with the character, book, author format: Reddit 

The line about mourning is followed by a reference to the rocky precipice from which the sisters leap. Here marriage is conflated with death. Psyche being led to a crag and exposed is reminiscent of a human sacrifice. Andromeda leaps to mind: 

Great question, btw. The use of "chartered" in this poem is something I think about not infrequently. :) 

This supports the friend/foe idea, and is further supported by a main theme of Eliot's poetry in general, and this poem and the Four Quartets in particular, about the conflict between the material and the ideal world, i.e. the conflict between the flesh and the spirit. 

Christopher Strobbe's answer is excellent, and I'll add this thought because, in my experience, the greatest literature operates on many levels. This is especially important for Dramatic literature, in that stage productions require an actor as vehicle to get the audience to connect with the material, which requires the actor being able to connect to the character's motivations. While the joke about censors (Master of Revels) would likely have been appreciated by much of the audience at the Globe, it's not sufficient to make the immediate reality of Hamlet in the scene convincing. Therefore, from the standpoint of the character of Hamlet: 

Beatrix Potter is much beloved of children and adults alike. Known mostly for cozy stories like Peter Rabbit, she almost seemed to break the mold with the lesser known classic The Tale of Two Bad Mice, which may well be her most transgressive narrative. It's well known than Hunca Munca and her husband got their names from Fielding's Tom Thumb, but what does the character of Hunca Munca represent in context? 

I understand that Beatrice is basically saying 'I would rather X than hearing a man say he loves me.' But I don't understand the dog barking at a crow bit. What does a dog barking at a crow signify? I did some research and found that a crow is a bad omen, so perhaps the dog barking is warning the owner of a bad omen? 

I agree with this, especially where it says 'if I wasn't sure that everybody would know who I was talking about I would go on to cite the book title and author.' and the Shakespeare/Juliet example Yahoo One answer: 

Here is a guide to citing fiction by Monmouth University. It doesn't say anything about quoting characters, but it does say the following: 

This seems to indicate it was planned to stop on the number 75, though Carey doesn't mention why. It could just have easily ended slightly before if the climax was a few issues before hand, the repercussions didn't have to continue for so long. It could have been planned just to end on 75 because that is quite a nice number, but I doubt that is the case. It is most likely that Carey had noticed this and decided to likewise end on 75. The fact it was planned in advance to end on the same number seems to infer that it was intentional. 

Could this be it? It seems to be a reasonably famous book (Cover says over 2 million copies sold) so it might be something your library had. 

Notes: Babel was published in 1941, when Penrose was only 10 years old, so the story predates the exciting, recent work in tiling patterns. The game Hex likewise doesn't appear until somewhere in the 1940's, but after its creation, a very large number of modern strategy games adopted this pattern. It never hurts to look at the Spanish, but Borges seems to write in a way that allows very faithful translation between English and Spanish. (His work tends to do well when translated by algorithms, in my experience;) Although it is possible to connect 3 rooms by creating a hallway through a vertex, this would disrupt the hexagonal shape, and render it an irregular, 7-sided polygon. 

This idea of literary elevation of genre fiction is reserved for relatively few genre authors--in speculative fiction those names include Swift, Orwell, Dick and Lem, although this list may extends beyond such Olympian heights. The same type of "transcendence of genre" is afforded to comic book authors such as Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, who elevated the "comic book genre" into the field of "literature". The idea of dividing the medium into genres goes back to Plato, where such divisions were seen a useful and necessary. 

This is an initial attempt at answering, and the answer may evolve. - The verse itself is a synthesis of romantic and transcendental love Joe Campbell would likely have talked about the Amor/Roma connection, which might also be expressed as Eros/Agape. 

Is a recognition of the mind of a creator with understanding far surpassing the average human viewpoint or conception. Symmetry here may be taken in the mathematical sense, with the implication of duality required in reflective symmetry. (i.e. "good" only has meaning in relation to the opposite concept.) The key line in the poem is: 

I believe the story you are after is the short story The split cherry tree by Jesse Stuart written in 1939. I found this by searching 'story boy father school teacher microscope' and it was the fourth or fifth hit. I read the story and as I couldn't find a good conclusive summary online I wrote one myself: 

This isn't an official guideline, but it seems good advice. So in the case of my example, like this: 

Also note there are a few more being written, and several planned as well. And if you want to be pedantic like Gallifreyan is in the comments below, you could technically say that The Martian should be read first :P I personally think the second order is better as it makes a better read. It makes more sense and nothing happens which you need knowledge from another book that hasn't been read yet to understand. Although obviously I have no idea where the unpublished ones should go, so I've placed them chronologically. 

A halter used to be a rope for hanging people - a noose. Nowadays it has evolved to be a strap around a horse's head, but you can still see the original 'rope around the neck' idea. DLosc in the comments below points out that it used to mean a strap round a horse's head, and became a noose when hanging was introduced in the middle ages. This website pins the strap round the horse's head meaning to Saxon times, and the hangman's noose to mid 15th century. See here: 

(On the track, he seems to pronounce it as "hat" requires a Boston accent if it's actually "heart"â€”Iggy is from Michigan;) Q: Do the lyrics posted on the internet come from a textual source, such as liner notes, or is it possible inaccuracies have been introduced and codified by the internet?

Meter is often used to set up a variation in meter. This is surely the case with this particular line, although the position only partly aesthetic: 

Again, my breakdown of the first line is in no way definitive, (and I'm not entirely happy with my choice, though the intent is readability and as a guide for delivery--it has been pointed out that a case can be made for a stress on the "in", which I personally feel is sub-optimal;) but it's indisputable that the second line is in perfect iambic pentameter. The genius of this choice is a factor of the beats to syllables ratio between the first and second line--4/11 vs. 5/10. This creates an extraordinary effect that might be termed "metrical compression", and itself can be understood as the merging of traditional and modern English poetry. Iambic pentameter might be taken as the normative meter in that in reappears in many important lines, and is used to set up or contrast the metrical variations of previous or subsequent lines. The other indisputably iambic pentameter lines is the poem are: 

Eliot's work, by contrast, is highly humanistic. If you're interested in this theme in Hughes, I'd highly recommend the poetry of Robinson Jeffers, who precedes Hughes, per Jeffers' central theme of inhumanity.
