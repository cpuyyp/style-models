The topic you talk about is Synergist(something such as a chemical or a muscle that enhances the effectiveness of an active agent) and Antagonist(a muscle that contracts with and limits the action of an agonist with which it is paired) muscles. The action of deltoid is shoulder abduction, flexion and extension so synergists of deltoid are Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres major and minor, Subscapularis and antagonists of deltoid are Pectoralis major and minor, Subclavius, Serratus anterior, Trapezius, Latissimus dorsi, Rhomboid major and minor, and Levator scapulae. 

I'm 29 years old, 5'10", 165 pound, 12% body fat percentage man. I have so small Gluteus Maximus size and I want to gain some size there. I do hip thrusts, glute bridges, squats, deadlifts, hyper extensions and any variation of lower body exercises for gluteus, I consume 2.2 times kg of LBM protein from highly bioavailable sources, enough macro and micro foods but still not enough result. I don't believe about genetic limit if you are not IFBB level. So i need some tips and advices about gluteus development techniques(not about how to do a good diet). 

There are heart rates zones that specific for each person depends on the VO2 max value. As they mention most treadmill boards there are aerobic, anaerobic, cardio, etc... The zone you should analyze is the maximum heart rate(effort) zone that you don't allow lactic acid to decrease your muscle activity. In that zone you can cycle for hours. 

There is no way to keep muscle mass without working out but if u keep your diet clean as u do while work out, u can minimize your loss and as they said before its easy to regain when u start back. So only tip I can give is taking care about your diet. Keep your protein intake as much as before and keep your daily caloric intake in maintenance (no weight loss and gain). 

Don't worry about mixing, just make sure flavors match. Creatine supplements are mostly have no flavor so you can mix any but most bcaa has fruit based flavors so maybe its not a good idea to mix it with whey unless they have flavor. 

I'm using preworkouts for years too. I tried many brands and there is no magic in that stuff. Now im doing my own preworkout with my way. I like tingling feeling and i put arround 2gr of beta-alanine, cold brew coffee that contains 150mg caffeine, 5gr of creatine, 5 gr of arginine, 5 gr of bcaa, 5gr of citrulline ...etc in my shaker and voila. That's way cheaper compared with ready product and I can manipulate it as I want. But the most important thing about preworkouts, body get used to the stimulants like caffeine so i don't consume coffee in workout days and i do caffeine diet to give body a rest. If you dont mind about taste thats a great method but if you care my favorites are C4 and PRE-JYM as preworkout. 

Progressive overload is one of the basic principle of building muscle mass so not be able to reach the rep count you mention is not so important. Always start with a weight you can do and increase the volume in each session. Never jump so much be patient and that weight will be your warm up set if u keep doing and taking care of your diet. 

I doubt if isometric exercises could improve punching speed – maybe you meant bodyweight exercises? Isometric exercises are ones where the muscle that's working is being held in a constant state of contraction, as in a plank. Here are some exercises to improve punching speed and power that we use in my boxing class: 

I've been doing Crossfit full-time (5-6 days/week) for a year now, and I have a really, stubbornly weak squat. It's so weak that it's always my limiting factor on compound movements like thrusters, cleans & jerks (not my upper body). I have very long limbs in general and especially long femurs, but it would surprise me if that's the only problem. My stats and 1RMs 

Here are some hypotheses I have considered and ultimately dismissed (but correct me if I should reconsider): Hypothesis #1: I should do Starting Strength. Counter-evidence: I did SS assiduously(*) for 9 months before starting Crossfit. It worked moderately well for most of my lifts except my squat, which plateaued extremely fast. Now that I'm doing Crossfit, my other lifts are again improving, while my squat rarely budges. Hypothesis #2: I should eat more. Counter-evidence: I eat around 2400 calories/day with a lot of protein, and my squat is the only lift that's so stubborn, so I assume this isn't the problem. Hypothesis #3: I have a mobility problem. Counter-evidence: If anything, the coaches at my gym comment that my mobility is unusually good. I can sit in an ass-to-grass squat with my knees touching my chest and my butt touching the ground, for example. Hypothesis #4: I have a squatting form problem. Counter-evidence: I'm lucky that my Crossfit gym has a strong emphasis on lifting technique, and the coaches think my squat form is reasonable. Their main comment is that I have a hard time keeping my torso upright (especially in back squats, but also front squats). I've tried to work on this, but it seems partly like a necessarily evil given the extreme length of my femurs compared to my upper body. So what should I do to suck less at squatting? Are there diagnostics I can use to figure out what the problem is? (*) Pun intended. Not going to lie. 

I'm a beginner lifter (female) doing Starting Strength. I'm having a problem with my deadlift form that I think might be partly related to individual morphometry. So, what happens is this: I set up as described in Rippetoe's SS with the bar at midfoot. I take my grip. I bend my knees until my shins touch the bar. Because I have (very) disproportionately long thighbones compared to the length of my torso and shin bones, this puts my hips quite low, my back at about a 45-degree angle to the floor, and my knees jutting pretty far out over the bar. It's a very awkward arrangement. When I start to pull, inevitably my knee angle "wants" to open first to the point that my back is horizontal before the bar actually leaves the ground (just like in Fig 4-35 in Rippetoe's SS). With this kind of form, I was deadlifting 1.28X my bodyweight. If I force myself to maintain the same back angle through the pull, I could probably deadlift more like 1X my bodyweight, if that. Even if I deload to just 65 lbs, it stills feels really awkward that my knees are in the way of the bar as I start to pull. I noticed that Rippetoe does allow for substantial differences in deadlift back angle due to individual morphometry – e.g., in Fig 4-31, the leftmost stick figure's back is almost horizontal. However, like I said, when I set up according to his instructions, my back angle is actually more like 45 degrees. So my questions are: what kind of form, especially back angle, is correct for someone with my morphometry (long thighbones)? An additional complication is that my squat is embarrassingly weak, so is it a problem of weak quads? And what should I do about it? EDIT: Indeed, my hips are rising to near-horizontal before the bar leaves the ground. 

Try to slow down the pace until you can do full pull-ups with good form and not swing. If you feel that you do not have the power to do the pull-ups with good form, use alternative ways of doing them until you are strong enough. Alternative pull-ups can be either with one or two legs on something a bit elevated from the ground so that you can help lifting yourself. You can also do negative repetitions to build strength where you have a chair or such and lift your body up and then slowly sink down without help still with good form. 

Your maximum heart-rate is set in our genes and can not be changed. And before going for a max heart-rate test you should be aware that it is a challenge which is very hard on your body and your heart. Due to this, never do max heart-rate tests when you are alone. Always have a partner when doing it. If you are a runner; you can try to reach your maximum heart rate by going for a warm up run for about ten minutes and then go for a small hill which need to be long enough for you to be able to run continuously upwards for more then two minutes. During the length of the hill you increase the speed in short intervalls so when you have been running for about one minute you should run as fast as your body can and you need to keep this speed up for about a full minute if possible. When you reach the top of the hill, your should bave been very close to your maximum heart-rate. Another way of testing this is to do the same resistance with warm-up and then a full performance run on an exercise bike. If all you are looking for is a quick estimation of your maximum heart-rate you can always use the old formula: 

I quite often read while I'm on the cross-trainer. Reason is mainly that I find it hard to motivate myself to work on it otherwise and by reading I stay on it longer then if I am just focusing on training. Also by reading I feel that I have to work a bit harder to keep my balance and by doing so maintain a stronger core. I have not read anything about this, neither good or bad but I have thought about it without coming to any conclusion. Looking forward to see what others think about this! 

The cool down period after a workout is very important and should not be minimized. A workout is a strain on the body as joints and muscles struggle to keep up with the challenge. After this challenge is over the body need to calm down so that it have the time to flush out tired muscles, keep joints warm and flexible and of course to slowly cool down the temperature. A good tip is to use 10-15 minutes after a workout to stretch during the cool down period and let the body to calm down in its own pace. I would recommend you to an article about the benefits of the cool down at exercise.about.com
