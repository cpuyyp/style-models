Unless you are traveling down the Autobahn at top speed with your bike mounted to a roof rack you hyper-car, you will probably be just fine. Pressure washer water velocity is about 243 mph (391 km/hr). A Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport is the world's fastest road legal production car with a top speed of 431 km/hr (268 mph). Technically, if you had a special rack designed for your Veyron (wouldn't want to upset the handling at 400 km/hr), you might be able to generate enough velocity for this to be a concern. Even then, it is likely only the head set bearings (or maybe bottom bracket if you have external bearing version) that will take the brunt. Even then, these bearings are oriented in a plane perpendicular to the plane of motion (which will greatly reduce the velocity of the water that actually interacts with the bearing seal face). Plus, don't forget that the front wheel usually rides inside the car and the rear hub is left on the bike, but will be running in disturbed air, which will further reduce the force of the rain water. 

CVT transmissions using conical pulleys and a V-belt are common on mopeds, scooters, and very small engined cars. One of the advantages is in the name: a continuously variable transmission with literally an infinite combination of gear ratios. 

Along with changing your brake pads/cables, you might want to eventually explore switching out what is undoubtedly steel rims on your bike with new aluminum alloy rims. The steel rims are notoriously 'slippery' to brakes -- especially when wet. The judder you're experiencing could also be a bent rim and a new rim would fix that (so would retruing your current wheel). You can either rebuild them using the old hubs or buy new built wheels. Because of the hand labor of rebuilding if you use a bike shop, it's often cheaper to just get new machine built rims with new hubs. Your bike likely has 27" wheels. You can swap them out with 700c contemporary wheels if you have enough reach on your brakes. Most brakes do. I did the same thing with my 1975 Peugeot UO-18 and the braking is now stellar with alloy rims. 

These days, many "hand built" wheels are really hand finished. The machine does the initial lacing and tensioning, the human does the final tension balancing. This could take less than five minutes of human time. Note that if you give your shop a random hub and a random rim, it'll take some time to research what spoke length you'll need for the lacing you want. Spokes might also have to be special ordered and/or cut to length. This type of research and prep work would add onto the actual time spent building the wheel. Rear wheels take more time in general than front wheels because of the dish. Disc brakes will also take more time because of the dish or if you change the lacing on that side. So I would say in terms of shop labor time, on the short side it'd be 0.5 hours of labor for a hub and rim that they're familiar with and have premeasured spokes for; to 2.0 hours for a hub and rim they've never seen and will have to do some research and maybe special ordering or fitting before they can start work on it. In the USA in 2017, shop labor is between US$40-80 an hour depending on location. This includes shop overhead such as rent and tool use. The shop may cut you a break depending on how much you are a regular. Tl;dr: Between 0.5 - 2.0 shop hours depending on how much research, special ordering, and preparation is needed as well as the complexity of the job. 

No. The bead seat diameter (inner diameter) is different by 8 mm. You cannot shrink a steel or Kevlar bead by 8mm, as they are designed not to stretch or shrink (otherwise a clincher tire will roll off the rim in a corner). You can try but the tube will burst out from the extra space. The tire bead is what interfaces with the rim. 

As mattnz alluded to it can be notoriously difficult to estimate calories burned, even with a heart rate monitor. As a bit of history, for the longest time it was generally believed that Polar heart rate monitors were the most accurate, because Polar essentially purchased the rights to the best proprietary algorithm available (going by memory, I will need to find the reference for that statement). The take home is that even if you have a high quality heart rate monitor you may still not be getting an accurate estimate of actual calories burnt as it can vary brand to brand. Without a heart rate monitor (as you are doing now) you should see even less accuracy. That said, of the two I would hazard an educated guess that Strava would be more accurate due to the depth of data they have at their finger tips. Now none of us know what analyses they are doing behind the scenes, but if they are leveraging any of that immense data archive, they should be able to provide better estimates, assuming they have a high quality statistician working (or consulting with) the company. Hmm... I should submit a cv... 

You could keep the cranks you have. You'd need to have your local bike shop bore and tap them for helicoil as but then they'd be (almost) good as new - depending of course on how much the actual chain rings are worn. I'd expect this to be roughly a 40-75 eurodollar job, so it might be cheaper than a new set. 

This is going to be difficult. I assume you have a tadpole or delta and you're trying to drive the dynamos off the paired wheels - and not the single (drive) wheel. Problem 1: Single-Sided Hubs The problem is that the paired wheels often use single-sided (aka wheelchair) hubs and most dynamos are made with standard hubs that are designed to be supported on both sides. Schmidt SON are (apparently) the rare counterexample that have single-sided custom versions. Problem 2: Dynamos have a "direction" Furthermore, dynamos are often built to rotate in one direction. Rotating them the other direction will lead to fiddly bits falling out of them. That's a problem because almost all dynos have the wires coming out one of the sides (usually the drive side) - and that'll mean that for the right side wheel, the wires coming out the right side will be unsupported. So in practicality, having a right-side dyno might be very hard. Problem 3: Double the Drag Dynamos have drag even when non-powered. It varies from about 3-5 watts which is negligible especially on a commuter bike, but when you have two of them, you're doubling to 6-10 watts of constant drag, which is felt more on a trike. Problem 4: Double the Electrical Inefficiency While you'll have twice as much current, you'll also at least double the amount of power you're losing to inefficiencies. You can rectify both using bridge rectifiers to get DC from AC but you'll lose some voltage (and thus power) going through the bridges. The problem is going around corners or in a circle, one hub will be putting out a higher voltage than the other and the lower voltage one may not be operating at max efficiency depending on your circuitry. The bridge rectifiers will prevent backfeeding but you're increasing the inefficiency of the system. Solution 1: Use buck-boost circuits to charge Lipos On my commuter (bicycle), a front dynohub is constantly charging a LiPo whether the lights are on or off. This is because my cheap Sanyo hub has drag regardless of whether it's under load, so I might as well as use the drag. I rectify and then pass it through a buck-boost to charge up a LiPo which then I boost to charge my cellphone when connected. You'll want parallel buck-boost circuits to avoid the problem of unequal power output listed in Problem #4 above. Solution 2: You're on a trike, forget dynos You're on a trike and so weight is obviously not important to you (sorry, couldn't resist the dig). So just get a small 10,000 mAh battery pack and/or solar charger and use that. It's better than the constant drag you're imposing. Solution 3: Get one really high quality dyno Get just one really high quality Schmidt SON dynamo and put it on the left side paired wheel if possible. Why the left? If youâ€™re in a country where you drive on the left (most the world except UK and Japan) then the road slightly slopes to the right for drainage. You're already needing to constantly turn a bit left to maintain a straight line and the unequal drag on the left will act as a slight trim and be felt less. The Schmidt SON dynos have been measured to have the lowest amount of drag when unloaded. Peter White says they have a tadpole compatible Schmidt SON for special order. I have no affiliation with PW except for a single order I placed a decade ago. 

Figure 2. Proportion of total power used to overcome rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag over a range of speeds. From R. Chung: At what speed does Aerodynamics of a bike come into play? Next we need to assess the gains of a lighter bike on a climb. If we compare the difference in weight between a climbing bike and an aero bike, the differences is relatively small compared to your total weight. Probably at most the weight of a water bottle (lets argue a 1 kg difference). Using Bike Calculator, assuming you are light (i.e., 60 kg) a 1 kg difference in the bike weights would require a sustained grade over 10 degrees to see a difference close to 1.5% in velocity (see Figure 3). This means you need long, steep, sustained gradients to generate the performance difference observed in the first GCN video. Few if any time trials are structured like this, which implies a climbing bike is actually a highly, highly specialized tool. You can verify this in the field by doing test time trial with and without a water bottle to estimate the effect this weight has on your realized performance. 

Cost/Safety/Performance: If the rest of your trailer is as beat up as your tow-bar, you might consider just replacing the entire trailer as your tires and axles are most likely also at the end of their lives. Trailers are pretty cheap and you could just buy a new one for 150 eurodollars or if you look at a thrift store or on your country's equivalent of Craiglists, you might find a replacement trailer for less than 50 eurodollars (which is about what the repair would cost). If you get one with the same wheel size, you can keep your old wheels and tires for spares. You could also easily repurpose your old trailer as a lawn handcart (wheelbarrow). 

there's a chance that the crankarm threads were worn or damaged -- and that is why the pedal came out. In that case, you will need to drill-and-tap a helicoil into the crankarm. This isn't something a normal DIY person can do, but it is relatively easy for a bike-shop and should only cost around US$20-40. 

You may be overwashing it. Rust needs water to oxidize steel and you're providing it in copious amounts. That combined with either the sulphur in the air or salt (if you're near an ocean) is a deadly mix. You may want to give your exposed bolts a nice coating of something that will prevent rust. WD-40 is fine for that purpose but washes off easily. Some people use Silicone Spray (available at your car parts store). I'm a fan of Boeshield T-9 -- it's purportedly based on a formula that Boeing designed to keep airline parts from oxidizing. The nice thing about Boeshield is that you can also use it as a conformal coating for electronics, meaning that at least as it applies to bikes, drips of it getting into your lights and speedos will not damage them. Note that any of these will be VERY bad for you to put on braking surfaces. That is, your braking surfaces will look nice and shiny -- but will be very slippery and won't brake anymore. Stopping disk rotors from rusting is hard -- the best way is to keep them dry and ride them a lot. And don't worry about a bit of mud on your bike. It's supposed to be dirty. 

It might have to do with how frequently the computer writes your GPS location to file. To optimize storage some write out a location to file once every few seconds, but carry out its own calculations on a higher resolution dataset in-memory before purging. If your route is quite twisty this can result in a shorter distance as Strava (and everyone else) assumes a straight line between locations in a .gpx file (this is really the only workable assumption). Check your bike computer settings, some allow you to specify the recording resolution (e.g., once per second). The downside could be that your computer may not be able to store as many tracks as a lower resolution setting (e.g., once every 5 seconds). 

In short no. I actually took a true wheel that I had built and carefully equalized all the spokes on each side with a spoke meter. This actually put the wheel slightly out of true. Rims, spoke nipple rim interactions, hubs, etc., are all imperfect. How you place the tension meter on the spoke will be imperfect. All of these little errors can add up to put the wheel out if true. Use the tension meter to check that you are at a good starting point, then finish the true by hand with a truing stand. 

The problem as @criggie notes is that the dropouts are not the same size front and rear. Thereâ€™s another problem which front hub drive ebikes experience which is that the front wheel loses traction very easily when accelerating or going uphill. So you lose all your power just when you need it most. 

A cheap source of touch up paint, especially for the more garish colors is nail polish. Use a clear coat on tip for maximum strength. 

Yes, floor pumps can condense water in them. The water is from atmospheric water vapor. When the pump walls are colder than the surrounding air, the vapor can condense just like dew forms on leaves in the morning. Temperature swings assist in the formation of dew and this is made worse by leaving it on concrete, which is not only often much colder than the surrounding air, but also retains moisture. After a while, the moisture in the pump will build up to the point where it has to get blown out the next time you use it. Especially, pumps like the Lezyne (which I also have) which are single-action designs, the top of the pump is open to atmospheric air and so the moisture can easily condense on the inner walls above the piston and trickle down into the main chamber. How to get rid of it: 1) Easy way: Dry pump a few times (i.e., pump it a few times with nothing attached) until nothing comes out. If you can do this outside in the sun, even better. 2) Slightly harder way: Do #1 first, then disassemble the top of the pump so that it's open to air. Take the piston out. Let everything air dry or dry on top of a radiator. While you have it apart, grease the piston seal slightly with the vendor approved lubricant -- usually any light silicon grease that is safe for teflon/rubber/leather. How to prevent it from happening Don't store your pump in a basement or garage where there is cool/damp air. Keep the pump off concrete. Store it somewhere where there is cool/dry air (best) or warm/dry air (second best). If that's not an option, you could also hang the pump upside down (with the handle in the stored configuration) so that any condensate that forms in the piston or on the handle will drip down. Keeping it away from the concrete floor would be an added bonus. Bonus Finally, here's a youtube video made by Lezyne showing how to overhaul their pump: 

Qualification Your question is missing specifics such as hill grade, but let's assume you are talking about steeper grades where it is relatively easy to hit speeds above 40 mph. Second you didn't mention environmental conditions (such as cross-winds) as some positions become rather dangerous if you are hit by a cross-wind or are descending a rough road. Focusing on Body Position While equipment has an effect, your single biggest gains will be improvements in your position on the bike. However please note that some of the more aerodynamic positions also unbalance the bike making it more unstable, increasing the probability of a crash. A reasonably safe and efficient position is to keep your weight back and get your your body into a wedge position (see image below). By getting down far enough the wind should hit your back rather than your chest, preventing your chest from acting like an air scoop. Also notice that the hands are brought in as close as possible to reduce drag generated by the arms. You should also bring your legs in as close to the frame as possible. Your goal is to present as little profile as possible. (Source: Bicycling) You can further tweak this position by bringing your body further forward and your face closer to the handle bars. This reduces the gap between your handlebars and your face/head reducing turbulence and shielding more of your lower body from the wind. In this case the rider has his hands on the drops as he is also navigating turns. (Source: youtube) More Unstable/Dangerous Derivatives It is possible to get into even more aerodynamic positions. The fastest position I have found is taking the position found in the first or second image and getting your head and body in front of the handle bars and tucking in all your extremities in the remaining spaces (the rider below is partly doing this). In the most extreme case your face should be an inch off your front wheel and your chest on your handle bars (not shown). 

The Porteur style of bicycle popular by newspaper delivery men in France in the 1940s-1960s had reverse brake levers, seen here in this diagram from an article from Bicycle Quarterly (the photo jpeg is titled rebourherseville1960.jpg): 

Aluminium doesn't like bending and rebending (try it with a soda can). I'd make sure that the frame isn't bent and if it isn't, then either get a new fork or an old fork from a donor bike. Your bike shop should help you do either. p.s. The headshock does limit which forks will fit on your bike as it changes the geometry. 

Instead, the best pedals sold for folding bikes are the removable axle pedals made by MKS and others. Rather than the pedal folding, the pedal axle disengages from the crank with a quick release. This removes the folding component and so this type is stronger and more rigid. The other advantage is that you can also get clipless as well as regular pedals. But even with this design, the pedal will still remain the weakest link in your power chain. The removable axle thins where it enters the crank (which means that the bearings are also smaller) and that the pedal retention system while improved and generally bulletproof is not foolproof (they keep making better fools). 

As a completely different answer, I am sure a lot of these type of tests are done by manufacturers. The information likely remains proprietary and never sees the light of day. The job of marketing is not to disseminate scientific facts, but to convince the public to purchase item X. The business model of cycling publications is to entertain, not run scientific journals. In the end a few dedicated souls try to do their own experiments, but this information is never largely disseminated. In the end the consumers never know the real truths, and relies largely on anecdotal evidence. 

The springs simply keep the quick release (QR) skewer centered in the wheel hub, making it easier to insert the hub (and wheel) into the frame dropouts. It has no safety function other than to facilitate seating the wheel correctly. If the wheel is not seated correctly in the drops when you tighten the QR then you run the risk of the wheel coming out during a ride. That said, this is true whether or not you still have the QR springs. When tightening the QR, it should be tight enough that the QR lever leaves a mark in the palm of your hand. Finally, if you are getting a squeaky metal noise your single QR spring may be on backwards. The narrow end should point toward the hub, the wide end toward the end of the QR skewer. If you have it backwards the wide end of the spring will get jammed into the frame and hub axle, potentially making a squeaking noise when tightening the QR.
