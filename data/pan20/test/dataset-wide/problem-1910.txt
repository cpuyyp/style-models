I have a number of things to say so I'm going to attempt to make this as brief as possible, but this is a complex topic so I apologize if this gets lengthy. Before I begin: It is extremely unlikely that employers are "discriminating" by indicating that they want good written and verbal communication skills. While there may be some people out there doing that, it's honestly pretty ridiculous to imply that it's discrimination and I'll explain why in a moment. Ok, so let's break this down a bit and look at a few factors I think you're overlooking: 1) Being a native speaker or fluent in a language has almost nothing to do with being able to communicate effectively. I know plenty of incredibly intelligent, native English-speaking people who can't clearly and concisely convey an idea to someone with a lower-level understanding. Which brings me to my next point... 2) Just because a job isn't a sales/customer-facing position doesn't mean the ability to communicate is less important. There are multiple facets of communication and being able to speak to strangers and empathize with people (sales) has basically nothing to do with being able to convey ideas and concepts effectively. One of the most critical aspects of a software development position is the ability to work with team members, analysts and customers to identify and resolve issues. If you can't explain technical information or relate concerns effectively then you're going to waste valuable time re-discussing or even worse re-developing things because there was a lack of communication. 3) Frankly, I think IT is one of the most diverse fields you could discuss and that out of all the possible things you could complain about discrimination shouldn't be very high on the list. I've worked with people of all genders and nationalities, both in person and through online collaboration. If anything the stereotypical Asian/Indian engineer you often see in media/advertising is an indication that discrimination isn't a major issue. 

Acknowledge the problem, make him show his notes, force him to improve [Edit: Worked in some good advice from the comments.] The recommendation to post this over on workplace.se is not a bad one, but this political problem has such a strong UX leaning, it's unlikely that site will provide you with the specific advice you'll find most useful. I think it's possible to make life easier with this guy, but not before stepping up, taking on the responsibility of Team Lead, and confronting the problem head on. This suggestion isn't going to make the problem disappear, just make it more livable-with, initially reduce his input by making more work for him, and eventually increasing the chances that his input provides actual value. Engaging in some candid communication is often the best approach in these situations, but it's not an approach without risks. The main risk being that this guy turns out to be a real asshole, develops a nice big bruise on his ego, and decides to make things even worse out of spite. I would call this guy aside and tell him that: 

I agree with the other posters, an NDA is meant to protect the companies involved from having sensitive information/data/etc leaked to outside parties. If you are applying for a position AT the company the NDA was with then I see no reason you shouldn't be able to mention that. However, if you're concerned then instead of contacting a lawyer I would recommend contacting the HR department of the company you're looking to apply to and ask about it. Tell them you have a question regarding their NDA agreements and whether it would be appropriate to mention a prior work relationship with the company covered by an NDA in your cover letter. That way you have a definitive answer from the company, and you don't have to give them your name or info in order to do so. That way if they say "absolutely not" you just don't mention it and they will never know your app was the one inquiring about it. 

As others have said: honesty is the best option in this situation, you don't want to have it seem like you're covering something up or hiding something. Just explain what you did (and why) and then ask how you should have handled the situation differently in the future. The other reason I'm adding this answer is this: when there is a situation in a work environment where you have something (or have access to something) that you aren't supposed to... NEVER delete, alter or otherwise touch anything. The very first thing you need to do is contact your supervisor and/or security manager and inform them that you have "spillage" and that they need to investigate/resolve the situation. It is extremely important that you take no action so that they have the ability to assess the situation as you found it. Your mistake here wasn't your intention, it was the fact that you acted without instruction in a potential security breach. Information security is one of the single most important areas these days, and while I'm not trying to make you nervous you should understand that companies take that stuff extremely seriously. 

Conclusion Pulled off effectively, and assuming this guy is reasonable, this approach should initially get him out of your hair while he goes and spends lots of cycles strategizing about how he's going to change the world, and googling what 'heuristic evaluation' means ; ) If you can take control of the situation by showing him you have a firm grasp of what it is he should be providing, but giving him perceived freedom of going off and coming up with his own great ideas, but that are delivered on your terms i.e. with backup and rationale, you turn the tables on him. You essentially reframe the relationship. Again, it's a risky approach, and if you don't have a great deal of confidence that you can pull it off, you should ask for general advice on how to handle this sort of situation, either from your HR dept, or somewhere like work workplace.se A couple of good books that deal with the topic are Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most and Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When the Stakes Are High The ultimate goal is that this guy will actually learn how complex and diverse a discipline UX really is and get somewhat of a reality check, hopefully leading to a widening of his vision of his role, and eventually to an improvement in the quality of his input. All of which should make your app better, and make life a bit easier for you and the rest of your team : ) 

The point I'm driving at here is you still need to differentiate yourself from other candidates, and the number one thing for many companies is your ability to communicate. I'm currently a software developer, but I spent a decade working in sales/management and if I were hiring today I would MUCH rather an average programmer with excellent communication skills and a good attitude than a "rockstar" programmer with middling communication and a bad attitude. 

Unless there is a VERY good reason why you can't make it earlier (something such as having children you are responsible for dropping off at certain times) then I think it's an extremely bad idea to ask to reschedule. Particularly since it's only an hour earlier than your normal start time, are you really saying that you can't go to bed and get up one hour earlier for an interview? Frankly, if I was the interviewer in that situation your resume would immediately go in the "pass" pile even if you were otherwise a stellar candidate, because someone with rigid and unflexible schedules/routines are far more difficult to work with. Without knowing more about your situation (why the time is a big deal) it's hard to give advice, but I'd strongly suggest you sit down and evaluate why a start time prior to 9:30 is a big deal... because it really shouldn't be. I'm a night owl myself, I'd much rather be up until 2-3am and sleep until 10~ than be up early. Yet I still drag myself out of bed at 5:30 every morning for work even on days I stay up too late and don't get "enough" sleep, because that's the schedule I work and I value being a good (and reliable) employee more than my "preferred" sleep schedule. Also, getting off earlier in the day is super convenient... 

Ex-headhunter here. (Mainly tech industry roles, Director level and above) I think you may be giving this situation, and this firm, a little bit more respect than is deserved. Here's the context in which you are making this decision: To a recruitment firm, you're essentially a name in a database. If that name comes up in search as a potential candidate, you temporarily become an important asset, but only for as long as you remain in the running for a role. While it's unfair to paint all headhunters as ruthless mercenaries, as is often done, few of them have truly have your career development in mind. You could say that this firm has dropped the ball when it comes to your case. Letting you know the details of the role early on, and now giving you the runaround when it comes to maintaining contact. It should be in their best interest to "keep you warm", even if they are scrambling on their end to reorganize after the departure of your recruiter. How you proceed here, I think, depends on whether the position is posted publicly not. If it's an open posting, then screw the recruiters - you owe them nothing. The likelihood of repercussion is slim. Them missing out on the chance to present you to their client is their problem, not yours. If it's a closed position, it's slightly different situation. There are two main potential risks. 1) The person at the company that hired this recruitment firm (and possibly others) will be expecting applications through those channels, and you risk not getting your application on their desk. 2) You "step on someones toes" as you put it. This should only be a concern if you think this recruitment firm is going to play a big part in finding your next role, either this one or another. By going around them, there a small chance you'll make someone there look bad, or lose favor, and that may negatively impact your standing with them. If I was in your shoes I would do the following: If the position is posted publicly, stop losing time and apply for it now. If you can't find the position on the company's site or elsewhere, then write to the recruiters and say something along the lines of "It's been n been days/weeks since I heard anything from you, and I'm growing increasingly concerned that I'll miss out on this opportunity, so I'm going to move ahead with my application, thanks." If that doesn't motivate a reply, then you really have nothing to care about. Give them a couple of days. If you get nothing back, apply to company as best you can, and say something like "I was a candidate with X recruting firm, but some personnel issues there have lead to complications and hold ups, so I'm applying to you directly out of concern that I'll miss this opportunity". Bottom line: Take a note of the recruiters book and be a bit more ruthless about this. Remember that even if you step on toes, you're probably still going to get the call from them if you look like a perfect match for the next role they're trying to fill. 

I don't see any reason why you would ever turn down a raise unless it also comes with a different title or responsibilities. In the latter case it might make sense to turn it down because you wouldn't want them to spend time/resources training you only to have you leave a couple weeks later. However, if it's just a raise by itself then you should absolutely accept even if it doesn't result in any additional pay (you leave before it takes effect). 

As for your experience with interviewing: I think that you're attempting to rationalize to yourself why you weren't selected, and if I had to guess I'd say it's because you're either overestimating the relative strength of your qualifications or your resume isn't doing a good job of highlighting why you're a strong candidate for the positions. As another poster said: you're not being passed over for having a foreign sounding name in a field where a TON of companies are outsourcing IT services overseas and everywhere you look in the online community are developers of all races and nationalities. That's what I meant when I said it was a little ridiculous to imply, because I don't think you could pick another field that's as diverse or forward-thinking. I would suggest that you try to keep an open mind about things and not be too quick to dismiss the importance of them. IT is a good field to be in, but just like a college education... it's not a magic bullet. There has been tremendous job growth over the past 20 years, but there has also been an explosion of people getting educated in the field. Some people seem to think you can't look without bumping into countless opportunities, but that just isn't realistic.
