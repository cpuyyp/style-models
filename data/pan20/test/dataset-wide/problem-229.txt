Obvious the place to be in the aftermath of a nuclear war and in the event of a nuclear winter is to go South. The question was about which Third World countries will survive in the event of a nuclear winter. Australia and New Zealand are certainly First World countries. Argentina and Brazil can almost qualify too. China historically has been a major super-power, and is modernizing fast but may fit the bill of being a Third World country. South Africa has a mixture of affluence and poverty. All in all, it is more probable that many nations will survive with their governments intact. Most likely they will be coalition governments or military dictatorships but generally similar to the governments during the Firs and Second World wars. Third World nations are probably going to be "eaten up" by stronger nations in their rush to survive and rebuild. A recent review of the consequences of nuclear war specifically about the climatic impact. While the Physicians for Social Responsibility published a report suggesting even a limited nuclear war will result in global climate change and a famine affecting two billion people. Research was unable to find anything about the impact of a nuclear winter on the South East Asia region. Nations like Malaysia and Indonesia surely will survive. While countries close to China will politically realign themselves in its sphere of influence to ensure their survival. Possibly India and Pakistan will wage nuclear war against each other, but if the northern hemisphere has been devastated this might stay their hand. 

Many religions do not necessarily equate ghosts with souls. Also, the supernatural and the religious may be related, but they don't necessarily become the one thing. In a world where human consciousness survived in a spirit form, these would be simply seen as spirits of the afterlife. As their becoming more powerful and dangerous this sounds like the dangerous kinds of spirits or ghosts in some Asian supernatural traditions. Indeed there are religious traditions where the body has multiple 'souls', for example, the ancient Egyptian religion. The existence of ghosts will form the basis of ideas of what existence beyond the grave is like, and if the religion allows for multiple 'souls', then ghosts could be only one of those 'souls'. (The word "souls" has been place in inverted commas to distinguish it from "souls" as we conceive of them.) If this world has some form of awareness of other worlds, no matter how imprecise, once more this concept will feed into the ways they might believe in other worlds where the gods might dwell, which is common enough for many human cultures, places of the afterlife (heavens, hells, valhallas, paradises, even worlds where people are reincarnated to live the next phase of their existence), worlds for different spirits and 'souls', and possibly simply worlds where ghosts go after they're finished here on this world's equivalent of Earth. In a world where ghosts are real and there is the distinct but imprecise knowledge of the possibility of other worlds these concepts will furnish a rich basis for the creation of remarkably diverse and creative range of concepts involving spirits of all kinds and 'souls' of all imaginable kinds. Religions, naturally, will be strongly influenced by these concepts and employ them in various ways for the propagation of their beliefs. 

This is entirely dependent on the power structures in this future world. Racism is essentially a mechanism for disempowering the already disempowered. To institute racism social, economic and political power needs to be taken away from the outcast group. Of course, if the morphological changes are being made to the bodies of the wealthy and powerful, then it may be the former natural types who are discriminated against because now the so-called elites will be able to distinguish who their inferiors are. Racism works by downgrading the status of persons or classes of people whose labour, this can be physical or intellectual, is captured and employed for the benefit of the wealthy and powerful. African slaves were turned into living machines whose work was employed to create wealth and power in Europe and the Americas. There was no point in continuing to consider them as having value in their own right human beings so they were axiomatically stigmatized as less than human. What the Nazis called untermenschen. While prejudice easily arises with respect to outgroups, those who don't look, act or seem like us, real racism needs a foundation of power to facilitate the dehumanization of an 'underpeople'. It's all about power, it's always been about power. 

Crusades are launched by nations because the target country has resources and property they want to acquire, or the crusaders want to extent their territorial sovereignty. Their monotheistic religion is merely used as the basis for the political propaganda to rally the population behind the campaign. Since their religion is all about virtue and law, your average skillful propagandist wouldn't need to do much to find egregious examples of the failures of virtue and law in the target nation. Lo an behold! You have poor benighted people in the target nation who need saving from the heinous of their rulers or they are all evil sinners who should be put to the sword. Whatever! Once your populace swallows your propaganda, it's time to mobilize your forces and set off to claim what is rightfully yours. Crusades are land and treasure grabs wrapped in the finery of outrage and branded with religious ideology. Religion, irrespective of whether monotheistic or polytheistic, is nothing more than the fuel for a political campaign to justify plundering the wealth, resources, and real estate of the target lands. Historically the Crusades were intended to reclaim the religious heartland of Christianity, but they worked quite well as a means of plundering the territory they were supposed to liberate. It's all about who benefits from the crusade and how much they can carry away. The religion is only there for ideological justification, thus granting the crusaders the stamp of approval from their deity (or deities, as monotheism doesn't have a monopoly on crusades). 

The causes of war and, therefore, of conquest can be summarized as power, resources and ideology. Power If their power potentially threatens your power or sphere of influence. Perhaps not now, but why wait for the inevitable? Resources Their system has system your civilization needs, will need or just plain wants. Also, related to power especially their access to resources will place their system in galactic geopolitical ascendancy over your system. Resources can include living space. For example: We both need earthlike planets for habitats, theirs is the closest and easiest to reach and conquer. Ideology "We hold these truths to be sacred, self-evident and the best thing since sliced bread." Our heinous, slime-covered neighbours don't. They're evil. We must crush their horrible system. And, of course, vice versa. We are horrible in their three pairs of eyes. Ideology is the most complicated factor. It can be any cultural, political, economic or religious institution or factor. Usually, tied up with power and resources either directly or indirectly. It both amplifies and reinforces any decision to wage war. These three concepts have general application. They are the underlying causes. The putative reasons for going to war may include something like a Zimmerman telegram or the invasion of Poland or crossing the Rubicon, however, the terrible triad is usually lurking there in the background.
