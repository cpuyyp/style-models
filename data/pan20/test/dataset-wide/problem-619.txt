Yes, there are problems. Not only do the mechanisms have to be complex, as you can see in the videos, but they have to be very strong, too. The moving parts of the chainring drive has to withstand the total force the rider is delivering, because the input to the pedals will try to drive the expanding elements inwards. Complicated precision mechanisms, high strength, and low weight is a combination that is rarely found together for reasonable prices. Compare that to a derailleur system. In a derailleur based drivetrain, the derailleur doesn't see any significant loads. All it really has to do is to move the chain from side to side. That's about it. It can be a little tricky when you are shifting under load, but pins and ramps on chainrings and cogs can do the job to ease the load on the derailleur. In the expanding chainrings, that has to bear the brunt of the entire rider's power output. Ever had a brake cable slip through the binding bolt while braking? That was only with hand power. Imagine standing on the brake lever, imagine how much of a hassle it would be to make that connection rigid enough. Furthermore, imagine trying to shift under load when you have to overcome the force you're putting to the pedals. You still need a chain tensioner on the drivetrain too with these systems so there really isn't any benefit apart from novelty. 

Depends on what is meant by "best". The most thorough approach would be to remove the cassette from the wheel and clean it in an ultrasonic cleaner. Probably excessive. Second best it to remove the cassette and use a mild solvent (e.g. WD40) and a rag to clean the sprockets. This is a good time to examine sprockets for cog wear (the smaller ones in particular). It is also possible to clean in situ with a wipe, a rag or some kind of floss. Whatever you do, do not flood a mounted cassette with solvent. You might inadvertently remove lubricant from the freehub and/or wheel hub. 

Your bike appears to have "Giant Tracker Sport Disc" hubs. They appear to use cartridge bearings. Additionally, some service manual PDFs found online make it appear axle removal is a somewhat involved process, and so your axle removal may have disturbed some bearings. It also appears to use a proprietary axle type but I'm not 100% on that. Take your bike to where you bought it or another giant dealer, as they'll have the specialized tooling needed to fix your bearings and will be able to order a new axle. 

I personally remove, clean and examine my cassette once a year. If your chain is well maintained you are unlikely to have to clean your cassette more frequently. 

Zero means going straight, 90+ degrees is probably impossible. So what is the maximum steering angle needed to ride safely? 

Speed may be considered to be the ultimate output of the cycling process and therefore performance would be measured with a chronometer/speedometer. And that would be it. Watts may be considered as an input in the cycling process. A power meter will provide an intermediate measure of effort, which is but one of the speed determinants. Several factors may be considered, some belonging to the environment (wind, traffic, etc.) some to the rider (aero position, state of mind, proper pacing, etc.), and some to the bicycle itself (aero, weight, inertia), such that speed will vary greatly for a given power level. You may also want to measure other "performance" metrics, such as how efficiently you can convert food to Watts. Heart rate monitors are well known devices. Muscle monitors are appearing over the horizon. They could conceivably be measures of metabolic performance. 

I use lots of paper towels, but I know Home Depot, Menards, Lowes etc all sell big bundles of terry cloth towels in their cleaning supplies sections. 

You can't. Calories burnt depends on your speed, elevation change, and your body composition. e.g. riding at 30mph burns more than double the calories per hour than 20mph. The calorie calculators just make a rough approximation, and their margin of error is significantly greater than the difference between their assumed bike weight and yours. Just take what they provide as an estimate, or supply your weight as being your actual weight plus the extra weight on your bike and call it good. 

I would suggest considering two power components: (1) rotational speed and (2) torque. It should be naturally obvious that these two principles will impact the ability of a chain to jump across sprockets. As rotational speed tends towards zero, shifting becomes problematic. As torque increases, the chain will require more lateral force to be lifted above a sprocket’s cog. Going uphill while maintaining a reasonable cadence has limited negative impact on modern cassettes that have sculpted cogs to promote easier shifting. However, these designs are challenged if you are a masher (slow cadence + high torque). In the old days, riders would put less pressure on the pedals to reduce torque while keeping a high cadence. Today, higher end components work well under high torque as long as cadence stays above... I’d venture 60. 

Your sliding out at 5mph wasn't because the tires were slicks, it was for some other reason. They were either lousy tires, improperly installed, rider error, or some other factor. If you are riding on the road, there is no need for any kind of tread. Slicks are perfectly fine, despite your thoughts from your previous experience. In fact, they are ideal, and will be easier to handle on the road than tires with tread. A definitely don't get any of those combination tread tires, those are the worst. Forget the treaded tires with kevlar inserts. Get the Armadillos, Continental Gatorskins, or some other sort of flat resistant tire. Make sure they are always pumped up before you ride, and they'll serve you well. 

Larger sprockets are slightly more efficient. According to $URL$ you may get 0.5% more effective Watts, which would translate into something like a 0.2% speed gain. At an average of 20kmh, that is 40 meters per hour... 

I know nothing about the theory. But the world record for gravity bike is, according to Guinness, 103km/h. ($URL$ 

use 2+ bags. A small handlebar bag in which you carry your valuables (phone, wallet, etc.) and the number of panniers you feel is necessary to bring your purchases back home. Bring the handlebar bag inside, as if it were a purse. You can probably lock the panniers by threading the locking cable thru the pannier(s) handle(s). 

The COMPLETE set will likely cost more than 3x the cost of your frame and parts. The tool to prepare a bottom bracket is almost 500 bucks all by itself. So I'm not going to answer "the COMPLETE set", especially because your copy/paste wall of text doesn't indicate all of the exact specifications for all your parts, which is needed to know exactly which tool is needed. Get one of the bike Park Tool or similar kits, primarily for home maintenance. Then, get the Park Tool blue book, or some other book, to read so you know what you are doing when installing stuff. Otherwise, take it to the shop for the elements you can't really do for cheap (frame preparation), or see if any LBS has a public shop option, as Kibbee mentioned in the comment. 

This would roughly translate into 0.5 mm, probably impossible to measure while the cassette is on the wheel. A better way is to compare your old sprockets to new ones, when you clean your ageing cassette. Keeping in mind that sprocket wear is inversely proportional to the cog count, I'd suggest focusing on the 13T-15T-17T (or so) sprockets. Put the old sprocket on top of a new one (you have to purchase a replacement anyway, so buy one as a reference until the old one is worn) and inspect visually to appreciate the amount of wear at the back of the cog. 

Lastly, fresh powdery snow is a lot easier to go through than wet solid stuff. But powdery can be far worse if a hard icy surface lurks below the snow. Bottom line: Just go out and ride through snow and see what you can handle, then ride through something a little tougher. Best part is, the soft snow makes falling easier! 

Using the dt swiss calculator, I calculate 292 and 291mm spokes for building a triple-cross wheel with your selected components. 

Carbon fiber isn't necessarily a "weak" or "fragile" material. If you had a tube of the same diameter and thickness of typical CF as a typical steel frame tube, that CF tube would be extremely strong and durable. Metals like steel and aluminum are isotropic materials. That means their mechanical properties are identical in all directions. If you have a cube of steel, it will respond the same way regardless which direction you pull or push on it. Carbon fiber is a composite material. It consist of tons of little bundles of the fibers held together with an epoxy. A block of steel is, well, like steel, but carbon fiber is like a big bundle of straws glued together. In one direction, it is extremely strong, but if you push or pull to the side, it will collapse. In that one dimension where it is strong, it is vastly stronger than steel. However, in other directions it's rather flimsy. So, engineers have been able to exploit those properties in bicycle frames. In a bicycle frame, the vast, vast majority of the forces are primarly along a single dimension. They can make tubes thinner and lighter yet still retain the desired strength and stiffness. So, there is no mechanical reason that you couldn't build a fully loaded touring bike or something like a Salsa Fargo with a carbon frame, and it could be just as tough and durable. And it would probably be lighter than a steel or aluminum frame. But the reason it isn't done is because of the market. Carbon fiber is an expensive material and difficult to work with, and its mechanical properties are best suited for when you demand very light applications. When you build a steel framed bike, when you get the tubes sufficiently strong enough along their length, that because of steels isotropic properties, you get the lateral strength for free, the strength to resist things banging into it, withstanding crashes, etc. In a carbon fiber frame, you don't get the strength in the other dimensions unless you choose to design it in. In carbon fiber bikes, where weight is a serious concern, the engineering decision has been made to not make the frames strong in those areas. They could do so, but they choose not to because its not necessary for the bikes intended purpose. When you build a heavy loaded bike, you lose a lot of the carbon fibers advantages, and so it would be far more economical to use steel or aluminum. Especially when throwing a couple filled water bottles in your pannier nearly exceeds the weight savings.
