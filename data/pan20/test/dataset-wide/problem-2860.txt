It is important in reading Dawkins to understand that the only evidence that is admissible are essentially material: 

One example of a philosophical work where this is mentioned is CS Lewis's Mere Christianity. Toward the end of Chapter 7, he says: 

Most theists I've read (Aquinas being one best example), reject the notion of infinite regression in causality, and note that no material object is it's own cause. This implies there is a non-material (metaphysical) initial cause, which is called "God." Many theists would also point to miraculous occurrences as contrary evidence to this stated idea of "causal closure." One may disagree with them (it sounds like you do!), but if you ask how theists think about this, they point to things like events in the life of Jesus, Moses, or Muhammed (or more recently, well-documented miraculous healings taking place in post-revolution Lourdes, France). To be honest, from some of the names in the linked article, it seems like there might be question-begging in this principle: if one takes a materialist notion of reality, to say "physical events have to have physical causes" because there's no proof that anything contrary has ever happened pre-supposes the evidence I mentioned is wrong (which one must suppose to be wrong because physical event have to have physical causes...). 

The implication with this model is that it's possible to know one's happiness at each point in time along the way. Consider one possible counter-argument offered by Herodotus: when Croesus asked Solon who was the happiest person in the world, Solon told the story of others who were happier than Croesus. When Croesus asked Solon why Solon did not consider Croesus the happiest, Solon responded that it was impossible to judge the happiness of one's life until it was at an end. So, there is at least one different approach. 

One simple example of a philosopher who would have disagreed with the "existence precedes essence bit" is Plato: 

It probably depends more on the specific example, but you are probably referring to faulty generalization: 

As with the question you refer to, I would start by appealing to the philosophy behind Bayesian inference. From that framework, I agree with Calvin, that a state of ignorance is an unbiased one. Jeffreys wrote about precisely this, when he wrote that someone coming to a new problem should use the uniform (unbiased) prior to represent their ignorance. Since Bayes Law describes how a rational agent updates belief based on new knowledge, one can conclude that the only way for a rational agent to remain unbiased is to not know anything about the issue - you cannot remain unbiased. Your bias may shift toward believing something to be unknowable, but even that is a bias toward the question. So it seems a rational person cannot formulate unbiased positions. To show two practical examples: 

If you want a more detailed account, you can read his works. If you want a slightly-more-detailed-but-not-too-much, there's an epsiode of the History of Philosophy about Al Razi. 

From that point of view "We don't love God" does not imply that God does not love us. Most theologians I've read have said something like that our love of God requires us to allow it (that is, we exercise free will in the matter), and so our lack of love of God is despite the fact that God already loves us, not because God doesn't love us. 

One philosopher with basically the same idea (God as organizer of matter, not as creator) was Al Razi: 

We all know that appeals to authority do not make for good arguments. At the same time, it seems that in daily life, people act as if they have actual knowledge and not belief. I was listening to a podcast on al Farabi, and it was mentioned for him, hearing something from an authority did not constitute knowledge. So that got me wondering: Have any philosophers looked at how to reconcile how much in our daily experience we trust beliefs we get from knowledge and the philosophical intuition that those beliefs do not constitute knowledge proper? 

According to this reasoning, not only the existence of a chair, but existence itself is for one to define for one's self (necessarily, as a mental construct). 

So, in this view, it doesn't make sense to think about "time" as we normally apply it to our daily lives. God is outside of time. This quote also points to the idea that the nature of God that Christians believe in (the Trinity) also wasn't a "change" - it happened before there was time, and change necessarily depends on time (something was one way at one time, and different at another time). In terms of how standards of behavior change over time, consider the quote from Matthew 5: 

I'm having trouble understanding what it would mean for something to not equal to itself - equals is a synonym for is, and obviously, a thing must be itself. Moving in the other direction, there are lots of examples where a thing can be "equal" to something else: 

According to Martin Luther then, because of the nature of sin and what it's done to our souls, we are "forced to serve sin," and it is only by God's grace that we are prevented from sinning - in either case, it is not our own doing. (A list of quotes from the work). 

You mention justice as the reason to give someone a treatment that needs it, but one must also consider the virtue of prudence, as it is not always possible to make these decisions in a vacuum. Given the reality of finite resources (money, time, medical professionals), only so many treatments are available at a time, so there has to be a system for deciding who will get procedures and who will not. That some are denied procedures is not, in itself, unethical, but rather a function of how this is decided. 

I think this is the most debatable step. Certainly, in moral relativism, one does not admit a single standard. If a moral relativist said something like this, he would only mean "I think it is better, but you may not." However, I doubt any moral relativist would say something like this. More likely, it seems that a moral relativist would acknowledge the statement as vacuously true since the premise ("If you say that one set of moral ideas can be better") is false. 

As many programmers will know, in Java there are two different notions of equality. In one case, equality is about the object itself, but in another case equality is about the object's properties (the method of an object). This is analogous to your chair example. In measure theory in math, there is the idea of two sets being equal almost everywhere. The idea is that the two sets are the same except for a set of points whose measure is 0. In general in mathematics, there is a notion of an equivalence class, which is used in several different ways, but always following the same idea: for any purpose, the two objects are interchangeable, and thus "equal" for a particular purpose. For example, the rotation of a square by spinning it all the way around once, and spinning it all the way around twice, are "equal" in the sense that they result in a square with the same orientation. 

This question is made rigorous by the mathematical field of measure theory. In measure theory, a probability measure is one in which the measure of the full set is 1. Most of the obvious examples of measures are called translation invariant - just a fancy way of saying that all events are equally likely. However, it's possible to construct non-translation invariant measures on infinite sets. A specific example of this can be seen in the Poisson distribution (examples: arrival times, number of children in a family, number of passengers on a train) - although each integer itself has non-zero measure, the sum of the probabilities of all numbers together is still 1. 

Lots of good answers, just one thing to add. I have seen different uses of the term "spiritual" used by atheists: 1) In the first sense, it is metaphorical. This is the point of the Hitchens quote from jeroenk. Quotes by Einstein, Sagan, and other similar types likely fit into this category. 2) The second sense is "spiritual" in the New Age, mysticism sense of trying to connect to something that transcends matter. For an actual atheist, I can't imagine this point of view is internally consistent. If you deny that there is anything divine and that the universe consists only of the matter, trying to connect to something that transcends matter doesn't make sense. 3) Adoption of religious practices for non-religious purposes, with the primary example being meditation, are sometimes called "spiritual," even though there is no claim to a "spirit" being involved. 

One obvious answer is to look to the recent writing by Pope Francis called Laudato Si. It explains one particular way of connecting environmental issues with a theological/dualist/anthropocentric point of view. While obviously being primarily theological in nature, it also hits on relevant philosophical view points. 

In such a world view, it is not obvious that "to help out others to one degree or another" is necessarily the moral thing to do. 2) Closely related would be a morality based on the two works of Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Together, they argue for a laizzes-faire that acknowledges what many observe: that we generally want to see others be better off: 

Outside of academia, there are practical examples of existence as an individual mentally constructed phenomena: 

One can ask about "the meaning of X" for any X. One can therefore ask about "the meaning of the statement 'the meaning of life'", or the meaning of that statement, recursively, for ever Thus, since there is no base meaning (it's a kind of "turtles all the way down" statement), the statement "meaning of life" is meaningless. 

I would start with the IEP article on aesthetics, following the various links to philosophers mentioned in there (reproduced below). 

Each person defines a utility function. Each person, based on personal factors, preferences, psychology, etc., says "When I have this basket of goods, I am this happy." The problem of utilitarianism then is to find a way to maximize everyone's happiness given these different individual preferences. Someone just knows. Someone who is somehow considered worthy of making these calls decides that people will be X amount well-off with a particular basket of goods. 

However, in your specific example, I cannot imagine someone who had only ever met men who used language like that to refer to women, so the specific example you gave just seems to be someone ignoring facts. 

I think there are a couple important points: First, you are right when you say that we can't use an experiment to see how old this universe is, but I think that misses the point, because we can run experiments on the consequences of that event instead, and falsify hypotheses of the universe backwards from that. Second, we know that to run such experiments or to deduce logically from them the consequences of those experiments makes sense because matter is intelligible. Matter isn't magical. It doesn't behave unpredictably. It is governed by rules. Many philosophers throughout the ages have held this. In terms of contemporary thinkers, you can see this idea in works as diverse as those of Richard Dawkins and of Pope Benedict. 

His conclusion, of course, having considered the evidence and how to reconcile atheism and religion was converting to Christianity. 

I think with some training in mathematics (undergraduate level), dealing with infinite sets in different ways becomes pretty natural. It is obvious that any human mind can only comprehend finite things, so instead of trying to understand an infinite thing you reason about a finite description of how to construct it. You then use this finite construction to reason about the set. For example: instead of trying to keep in your head what the real numbers are, you instead just consider the reals as the completion of the rational numbers. So although the real numbers have a much greater cardinality, understanding that cardinality doesn't have to be that much harder. The best example of something that seems to escape human reasoning about sets is the Continuum Hypothesis: whether there is a set whose size is greater than that of the integers but less than that of the reals. 

Within those who stipulate there is a God, I've seen 2 major approaches to this question: 1) Logic is subservient to God. If God, or one of his representatives says something or behaves a certain way, then it becomes de facto logical, even if it does not follow from normal rules of logic. (My opinion, for what it's worth, is this often leads to "logic" seeming arbitrary instead of being the bedrock for argumentation that it's supposed to be.) 2) God is not simply logical, God fundamentally is logic. This follows in the sense that God is existence itself, love itself, beauty itself, etc. This tradition (which follows from an Aquinas approach to God) would disagree with your statement that "As God possess infinite knowledge, he can break laws of logic." The approach that this tradition usually takes is to say that we believe based on the evidence at hand that God is logical, but that because God is infinite, we cannot understand all that God does and thus some aspect of it remains a mystery (where "mystery" has a technical meaning). I would add that the Christian tradition has equated God's reason with the second person of the Trinity ("en arche ein ho logos"). In understanding this question then, most Christian philosophers I've read have pointed to this fact and the corresponding thoughts on the Trinity to understand the different related questions you raised. 

Just one quick example: Two numbers are coprime if they do not share any common factors (other than 1) and are not equal. From the definition, it is sufficient to show that two numbers are prime numbers to show that they are coprime, but it isn't necessary: 8 and 9 are coprime, but neither are prime. Thus, not all sufficient conditions are necessary. 

Algebra - how to use operations on sets of elements to combine two elements into another (potentially different, potentially not) element Geometry - deals with the distance between points and the things that fall out from that Fundamentals - logic and set theory, which serve as the basis for the rest of mathematics.
