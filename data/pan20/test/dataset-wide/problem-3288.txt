I do not understand the (bolded) last sentence above. How does essayer de NOT presuppose the prisoner's escape? The prisoner must have presupposed the possibility of escape before trying it? 

How is 1 true? I ask not about what is prescriptively idiomatic. For example, what if in uttering 'Really?', a speaker means >Really? How is this fortunate?< but without uttering the second question? 

I don't understand how "forward, through" evolved into one of the meanings of the Greek prefix para-, the one which means 'contrary to'. Etymonline seems to refer to AHI's particular entry of * per- labelled by the superscript 1, but nowhere does AHI explain this meaning of contrary to. Strangely, AHI designated para with the superscript 1, but AHI only features para once. Footnote: My research of the etymology of paradox motivated this question. 

The teacher emphasised his use of curious NOT to mean 'strange', but to mean a state that MAKES one curious (ie: inquisitive, solicitous). Does anyone know this term (of causation)? 

To me, the Description and Examples for Thematic/Semantics Roles appear 100% interchangeable: so what are the differences? 

I can't pinpoint why, but this ellipsis appears extravagant and wrong, because it makes such as seem mutilated and deficient. Is this type of ellipsis special? Would someone please explain or naturalise it? What were the precise steps or processes behind the ellipsis of 'such as'? 

I recognise the absence of authority or identity, but is the above true? What are the of Chomsky and Pinker? 

feeble (adj.) [:] late 12c., "lacking strength or vigor" (physical, moral, or intellectual), from Old French feble "weak, feeble" (12c., Modern French faible), dissimilated from Latin flebilis "lamentable," literally "that is to be wept over," from flere "weep, cry, shed tears, lament," from PIE bhle-* "to howl" (see bleat (v.)). **The first -l- was lost in Old French. The noun meaning "feeble person" is recorded from mid-14c. Is the loss of the first -l- part of a larger phenomenon? I am unsure whether dissimulation explains the loss of the first -l- here, because nothing in the Latin flebilis /ˈfleː.bi.lis/, [ˈfɫeː.bɪ.lɪs], seems to sound like the first syllable in Old French feble. 

Strangely, § 145 doesn't explain how « à cheF » evolved into « acheVer », but §142 (on pp xcii-xciii) claims to do so, but I see no explicit elucidation and so I am still confused.

I am trying to conquer my failure to disambiguate 'meaning' and 'semantics' by asking whether one can substitute for the other in certain sentences and then by verifying the substitution. So can 'semantics' can be used to rewrite [p 7.]? If so, is my [3.] correct; does [3.] mean the same thing as [1.]? 

Seeing only one s in demesne, I am confused by the OED: Where is the original s? Where is the non-etymological (so epenthetic) s? Etymonline states less. 

Please feel free to emend this if I have not described my question cogently. Though knowing little of Latin, I have exemplified with it because I have encountered it more than Ancient Greek. For example, in Latin, in addition to their (usual) meanings as prepositions, many common prefixes ad-, com-, de-, ex-, re-, etc... serve as intensive prefixes, but for a given verb, what motivated or induced the prefix used? Was a prefix chosen randomly? Or does each intensive prefix uniquely connote or imply an especial, particular intensification? 

I do not understand 1; why should not 'synchronic' be 'diachronic' instead? How can phonetically-motivated diachronic sound changes result at a given point in time, rather than over centuries? 

1. Please see the title of this post. 2. This phonological change (is this the right term) did not affect Latin to Spanish, because déluge = diluvio (nm) and the cognate for the English 'assuage' is aliviar. Does anyone know why not? 

Where can you download or obtain (preferably freely) such a chart like $URL$ with each phone pronounced, for offline use? 

The last paragraph above asserts that in 14a, the blue cannot replace the red. But why not? Why cannot [14.1] be rewritten as [14.4] below? [14.4] the x dislikes the fox named y. 

I already understand and so ask NOT about the definitions 1 and 3 above. Instead, I ask for a linguistic analysis of inasmuch (and similar syntagmas). To parse it, I consider its original form as 3 separate words (in as much), as stated above. 1. In in as much, what do the 3 separate words mean individually? For each of the 3 words, which definition from OED matches? OED is linked here for your convenience: in, as, much. 2. How did the bolded 3 morphemes combine to mean definition 4? For example, 3 contains no word that means in definition 4. So whence did originate? Please expose and explain all hidden, missing semantic drifts.

Of what was *bhes- ? How? I can't understand how hypothetical Proto-Indo-Europeans would have judged *bhes- to sound like breathing? 

I reread pp 78-79, but still do not understand why 28 is wrong and only 27 is correct. What is the main idea here? How does the concept of Heads resolve?

My question concerns only p 48: what does grammatical mean? Its use does not appear to match any of the definitions of 'grammar' below. I know of the distinctions between Descriptive, Prescriptive, and Teaching Grammar, but which do not appear relevant here. Sorry for the surfeit of quotes.

Explicit Question (TL;DR): I exemplify with English, because it has changed more than e.g. the Romance Languages, for a given time period. For brevity, I use the noun 'disquisition' to mean any decent, reputable piece of writing. What linguistic concepts reveal how a disquisition (from one time period), differs from another (written from another time period)? To wit, in which linguistic concepts do changes in writing differ? 

How does 'to go' relate to 'to yield'? Both verbs appear to differ in meaning. Moreover, what precisely does 'to go' mean here? Is this the right diction? I'm confused, because most verbs deriving from this PIE root concern either a submissive 'yield' or hindered progress (eg cede), neither of which equates to 'to go' somewhere. 

What semantic notions connect the 5 meanings beneath of 'so', with its PIE Etymon 'se-' that signifies 'self, one's own'? I can't understand how ''self, one's own'' semantically generalized to: 

How did "to cause to accept or be accepted" evolve into to appear, seem, think ? The connection or relationship escapes me. 

In modern English, 'penance' differs from 'penitence'. However, modern French lacks a cognate of the English 'penance'. Instead, 'penance' seems to be translated as « pénitence » (nf). Per contra, per the bold above, Old French did contain a cognate of the English 'penance'. So how did the same Latin etymon evolve into all this complexity? Please expose and explain all hidden, missing semantic drifts and links. I'm unversed in Latin, but I noticed that Etymonline above spells differently: first with the ash grapheme, then 'ae' separately. Please advise. 

For example, per (d), why can an NP (= Noun Phrase) Immediately Dominate D (= Determiner)? Why is there no Phrasal Category DP (= Determiner Phrase) that intervenes between NP and D? 

English and Spanish verbs express longing from the subject's perspective, but French from the object's. What might explain this difference? For example: 

I am confused why the definition of Theme covers only the NP in the predicate: why not the entire VP? What is wrong if I interpret Theme for sentences 1 and 2 as their entire predicates, as follows? The Theme of 1 is the roll of the red ball 2 is the hug received by Martha. 2 suggests differences between the ordinary English meaning of 'theme' and the Linguistics meaning. Am I correct? If so, then what motivated Linguistics's selection of this term? 

How do these 2 semantic shifts differ? In both, the original word adopts the (polar) opposite of its original meaning. I can't spot the distinctions? 

This dichotomy was inculcated in me for French and Spanish, but never explained or explored. So why was 'to know' partitioned? What's so special? Why did English evolve to unify the verb? 

Whence does this connotation of 'head' as foolhardiness originate? PIE? It appears in English words of Germanic origin like 'headfirst' and 'headlong', but also Latinate words like precipitate. What metaphors or key ideas explain and overlie the semantic drifts? What semantic drifts bridge the original meaning (of 'head') with the induced meaning of impetuosity? The head contains the mind, and so it seems contradictory to impute impetuosity to the head? For instance, feet implies impetuosity, because the feet enable someone to hurry somewhere recklessly. I don't know whether ancient peoples knew that the head contained the mind. 

Where can I find each PIE phoneme (which I don't know how to pronounce) transliterated and represented as IPA? Afterword: (Delightedly but fortuitously) Searching 'Grimm's Law' on Youtube directed me to this helpful video (explained in simple English), at whose 2 mins 27 secs juncture, the videographer (though a linguistics student) displays and pronounces (his understanding of) the PIE consonants. The video above motivated me to watch this user's other videos. In this one, he explains and pronounces ALL the PIE phonemes, to his understanding. 

I don't understand how the bolded sentences constitute a disaster? The book didn't include the Sumerian for food, but Google yielded: 

How does the crown relate to the front? Please expose and explain the hidden, missing semantic drifts and links. How should the etymology be interpreted, to connect the ulterior acceptation with the original meaning? 

2 of 2 quotes Root, stem, base Taken from: [...] English [W]ord-[F]ormation [...] by Laurie Bauer, 1983 (published by Cambridge University Press). ‘Root’, ‘stem’ and ‘base’ are all terms used in the literature to designate that part of a word that remains when all affixes have been removed. A root is a form which is not further analysable, either in terms of derivational or inflectional morphology. It is that part of word-form that remains when all inflectional and derivational affixes have been removed. A root is the basic part always present in a lexeme. In the form ‘untouchables’ the root is ‘touch’, to which first the suffix ‘-able’, then the prefix ‘un-‘ and finally the suffix ‘-s’ have been added. In a compound word like ‘wheelchair’ there are two roots, ‘wheel’ and ‘chair’. A stem is of concern only when dealing with inflectional morphology. In the form ‘untouchables’ the stem is ‘untouchable’, although in the form ‘touched’ the stem is ‘touch’; in the form ‘wheelchairs’ the stem is ‘wheelchair’, even though the stem contains two roots. A base is any form to which affixes of any kind can be added. This means that any root or any stem can be termed a base, but the set of bases is not exhausted by the union of the set of roots and the set of stems: a derivationally analysable form to which derivational affixes are added can only be referred to as a base. That is, ‘touchable’ can act as a base for prefixation to give ‘untouchable’, but in this process ‘touchable’ could not be referred to as a root because it is analysable in terms of derivational morphology, nor as a stem since it is not the adding of inflectional affixes which is in question. 

Optional Reading and Supplement: I reify the above: Suppose you encounter a disquisition with no background information (ie: the author, context, or date). As you start to read this disquisition, you will be able to estimate its time period, spontaneously and subconsciously. (You may not able to distinguish English writing in the 1500s from that in 1600s, but you can probably distinguish writing in Early Modern English from Late Modern English (1800s).) Please help me understand this subconscious ability: What precisely enables the reader to date a disquisition? For example, distinction is helped by: diction: former mandatory study of Latin (and Greek) explains the prevalence of Latinate over Germanic words in writing of the 1700s. syntax: sentences were longer in the past. but not grammar: authors may use different verbs, but tenses remain the same, except the past's preference for the subjunctive mood and literary tenses (eg French, Spanish). 

Please aid me to infer the connection with the Passive and Causative diatheses, implied by the use of the prefix 'anti-'. 

This questions concerns the velum for phonetics. I am trying to control my velum and especially to billow it or curve it like a dome, per the 3 minutes and 45 seconds juncture of this Youtube video.
