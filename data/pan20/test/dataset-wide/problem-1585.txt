EDIT Since DJClayworth (and likely others) believe that the "other side" of the CPS argument is my opinion, here are some supplemental sources that support my question (which is, in some ways, answering my own question, but there you have it): 1.) Tongue tie and breastfeeding: assessing and overcoming the difficulties, J Hum Lact 1990 Sep; 6(3): 117-21.: 

I just had my car serviced today, and my mechanic mentioned that canola oil was invented (or originally used) as a form of motor oil. Is it true that the canola oil we use in the kitchen is the same as an oil that's been marketed as a motor oil? 

Are Windex and other commercial window cleaners better at cleaning windows than vinegar and water (and other household chemicals)? For example care2.com suggests the following is the best window cleaner: 

While the statistical relationship between gun ownership and mass homicides has been discussed on Skeptics.SE, I have not seen any questions or answers on the following claim. The policy of the National Rifle Association includes statements such as: 

It seems to be commonly accepted that having a physician do a physical exam every year is beneficial. However, others seem to have concluded otherwise, for example see the Oct 17, 2012 article in the Washington Post Are general physicals pretty much useless?, which cites (with my emphasis): 

This is a question about the persuasiveness of the methods, quality of data, analysis and conclusions arising out of this study. Edit Per the comment by @Oddthinking, I think a good answer to this question would examine the methodology of the paper, and identify any substantial failings e.g. (any of which may or may not be the case): 

Are passengers protected from lightning while inside a car? If so, is this protection from: a. The rubber tires; or b. the metal shell of the car? 

Was Dr. Diane Harper the lead researcher for these vaccines, and do her comments amount to a refutation of the (unmentioned) evidence that the HPV vaccines reduce the risk of cervical cancer? 

The presence of iron microparticles are a byproduct indicate the presence of molten iron. No other explanation has been brought forward for their presence (that I am aware of). Molten Iron and Steel: Witnesses There are numerous credible eyewitness accounts of molten iron or steel. These include video of what appears to be molten metal dripping from the side of the WTC, as viewed in the linked YouTube video. Dr. Abolhassan Astaneh, UC Berkley Professor of Structural Engineering and, according to Wikipedia, one of the leading structural engineers to investigate the collapse of the World Trade Center towers, said "I saw melting girders at World Trade Center". Leslie Robertson, WTC Structural Engineer stated, "they pulled out the big block of concrete, and there was like a little river of steel, flowing ..." Captain Philip Ruvolo, NYPD stated in front of others who were in agreement "You'd get down below, and you'd see molten steel. Molten steel running down the channel-ways. Like you were in a foundry. Like lava". Ken Holden, director of NY Dept. of Design and Construction on C-SPAN 2, states "Underground it was still so hot that molten metal dripped down the sides of a wall". Here is a photo of molten metal, from WABC-TV. The liquid flowing out of the buildings is identified by Gery Warner, PE and former engineer at Alcan Aluminum as molten iron. 

There seems to be a growing movement of people who thing that praise is bad for children, as for example on the Not School blog. The thesis seems to be: 

Ignoring cost-savings from cloth diapers, are there any known long-term benefits to AP? Are there any detriments? Have there been any solid studies on some or all of the effects (positive or negative) of the tenets of AP: (a) co-sleeping, (b) extended nursing, and (c) baby-wearing? 

Is there any evidence that any of the above actually occurred, and that the photo has any relation to a woman of the sort described in the story? 

Professor Fagan also notes that the rarity of capital punishment limits the effectiveness of its deterrence – it is applied so infrequently that it is incoherent to believe it would enter into the state of mind of potential murderers. Professor Fagan goes on to comment that no study has ever been put forward that provides any evidence whatsoever that capital punishment ever enters into the state of mind of those who are about to commit murder (i.e. none of the studies even address causation): 

These are not necessarily inconsistent, but the underlying inquiry that both seem to be driving at is whether the Albertan oil sands are bad for the global environment because they emit a lot of greenhouse gasses. So perhaps the question could be rephrased as: Does oil extraction contribute to greenhouse gasses worldwide? If so, is Alberta a significant contributor? 

Have these billionaires taken a cash (or contra-stock) position on their holdings? As an aside, it would be interesting to reference any explanation of their position and strategy in the light of an expected massive impending U.S. financial calamity. 

The NY Times: A Search for Clues in Towers' Collapse By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON, Published: February 2, 2002: 

While this article is only imply that praise is good, it seems to be advocating praise of effort instead of praise for results -- in other words, I read it to be saying "not all praise is good". Leading us to my skepticism. What evidence is there to support the conclusion that certain types of praise for children are bad? Where "bad" means, as the article suggests, children forget about "independence, autonomy, and critical thinking" and the praise "engenders dependence". "Bad" also includes the consequences of this result. Further: What evidence is there to support the conclusion that only certain types of praise are good, and in particular (a) only praising the efforts? or (b) only praising accomplishment? 

I've started a community wiki to consolidate the answers. The professor I spoke with mentioned one drug that was discovered, alas serendipitously, by Barnett Rosenberg that effectively cures (with over 85% success) testicular and ovarian cancer: Cisplatin. This is an ideal counter-example to the skepticism (though at it's heart the skepticism is about the ability of our economic and legal incentives to procure cures, pardon the pun). Are there any other drugs that effectively cure anything that had not already been cured? Ideal answer would be listed as: 

There does not appear to be any plausible, competing theory that can explain the presence of nanothermites on the steel examined by Harrit. On his website, Dr. Harrit includes over 50 articles published in respected scientific journals. Other Sources of Information There's no substitute for sitting down with an advocate over a beer to really evaluate the credibility of ones' claim, but here's a bit of reading that might further thought on this - and from which much of this answer has come. 

According to the article “Buffett's $55 Billion Gamble is a Bet on U.S. Collapse, Warns CIA Economist”, a number of billionaires have taken a cash position on their holdings at the expense of stocks. The article details the transactions as follows: 

In all though, I thought it was an interesting enough article to quote in response to this question, an article worth reading in its entirety. 

It's a common statement that passengers of a car are protected from lightening while inside because the car has rubber tires (which are insulators). An alternative theory often put forward is that the vehicle is made of a metal conductor. The question is, then: 

Having just read a Slashdot article "Violent Games Credited With Reducing Crime Levels" on this topic that suggests that violent video games reduce violent crime, I thought it worthwhile to post it to this interesting thread. The Slashdot article cites the paper "Understanding the Effects of Violent Video Games on Violent Crime", dated April 7, 2011, the abstract for which is (my emphasis): 

It is possible that the conclusions of the above studies are consistent, perhaps because although THC only slightly impairs motor skills that slight impairment leads to a significant increase in the risk of a motor vehicle accident. Otherwise it would be helpful to understand the nature of the inconsistency. 

The above is affirmed in the more recent article “Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates? The Views of Leading Criminologists,” Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 99 (2009): 489-508 (Michael L. Radelet and Traci L. Lacock). Few are as eminent in criminology as Professor Radelet, from whom I select a choice quote “The more people know about the death penalty the more likely they are to oppose it”. The United Nations, Norval Morris and Marc Ancel Criminologist Norval Morris prepared for the United Nations (and, incidentally, cited by Justice Marshall in the Furman case), citation Capital Punishment, UN Doc. ST/SOA/SD/9 UN Doc. ST/SOA/SD/10 (1968), Vol. II, p.123 states: 

I'd have thought this would have been asked already but I didn't see it. Is driving the speed limit safer on a highway? By "highway" I mean high-traffic areas, such as 4-lane divided thoroughfares. Having commuted for some time, I've noticed that people who clearly drive at excessive speeds seem to be dangerous. However, more often than not the danger I see is from people who are driving slower than the prevailing rate (where the prevailing rate is generally more than the speed limit). This seems more dangerous because it disrupts the flow of traffic, irritates drivers and people behind the slow driver end up tailgating. Is there any evidence to suggest that: 

Was there an illegal CIA project called MKULTRA, and if-so what did it involve and when did it end? Did it involve, as suggested in a quote from Ted Kennedy, a massive conspiracy involving dozens of universities and institutions to perform tests that would probably be considered illegal? From the Wikipedia article on MKULTRA: 

Professor Fagan, professor of Law & Public Health at Columbia University The view of Professor Lamperti is affirmed by the systematic review of Jeffrey A. Fagan, Professor of Law & Public Health at Columbia University in his article “Capital Punishment: Deterrent Effects & Capital Costs”. In this article, Professor Fagan provides a thorough and highly critical analysis of the flaws in the statistical methods and conclusions of those who argue capital punishment is an effective deterrent: 

tl;dr: There is no evidence supporting the conclusion that capital punishment is an effective deterrent for murder, and significant evidence to the contrary. The only way to arrive at an alternative conclusion would be to ignore or refute: 

However, other studies have found otherwise: "The impact of cannabis on driving." Bédard M, Dubois S, Weaver B., Public Health Program, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON. michel.bedard@lake-headu.ca states: 

Arguably the presence of someone with a gun at a prospective target would act as a deterrent, but the claim seems to be that use of the guns by a "good guy" prevents mass killings, which (perhaps incorrectly) I take to mean that the "good guy" with a gun used it to kill a potential mass murderer before the killing began. While the use of firearms has certainly stopped a number of mass murderers from continuing a killing spree that had already begun, are there any examples or records of statistics on the number of mass murderers having been prevented because there a "good guy used a gun"? 

Though it appears the access to the article is restricted, I would nevertheless like to understand better the claims made, and the scope of this and related studies. In particular, I would like to know how sound the methods of the study are e.g. did they cherry-pick the 63 studies, or were these the only 63? Are there conflicting studies that have been left out? As well, what do the authors mean by "religious" e.g. is the scope of the studies limited to only Christians in the USA? All to express: How convincing is the methodology of this study, or any related studies proposing to answer this question? 

Both are references from eminent professionals, so I'm left wondering which is correct. Why's there a disagreement between what Kenneth Rogoff states and what the Economist states – is it just a matter of semantics? Are there indisputable examples of where the US federal government has defaulted? 

Do commercial window cleaners offer any advantage over vinegar + water (+ dish soap), the best window cleaner suggested by some web-sites? 

Unfortunately I could not find in short order either the Urban Institute or Federal Reserve studies referred to. It is not clear from the article whether 35% of Americans are currently in collections, or have at some point been in collections (and if it is at some point, how far back these statistics account for). 

I would like to know which is correct - or perhaps why the two authorities differ. Does inducing labour increase the risk that a C-section will be necessary? 

Obviously there is bias in the source I've given because it's the same author as the claim being analyzed. However, the paper spells out in better detail the actual claims Levitt has made, and further it provides the basis and references for those claims — The evidence put forward in the paper supports the conclusions in the book. Clearly, analysis by individuals other than the author of the book would better illuminate how well supported the conclusions are, but I wasn't able to find any right away. 

So-called pox parties have been around in various forms in varying degrees of popularity since the 1980's, and are described on Wikipedia as: 

I recall this claim being published in a newspaper a while back but time has buried it in the Interwebs, though it does come up from time to time as e.g. 

According to Researcher: Children's cancer linked to Fukushima radiation By YURI KAGEYAMA Oct. 8, 2015 4:25 AM EDT 

Which is all to say that while there seems to be a consensus that contrails have a climate change impact, the jury seems out - at least in the mainstream media articles that came up - on what that effect is. The claims, at least as I have read them from the above, would seem to include that contrails: 

It seems that there is conflicting evidence on whether inducing labour causes an increase in the likelihood that a caesarian section becomes medically necessary. Let me quote two authorities: British Medical Journal “Outcomes of elective induction of labour compared with expectant management: population based study”, BMJ 2012; 344 doi: $URL$ (Published 10 May 2012) 

In the article titled Men want more testosterone, the world needs less in the Globe and Mail on Sep. 27, 2011, Margaret Wente states:

Does Van Eck phreaking perform as described, i.e. allow a person to observe what is being displayed on a given computer screen (notably a LCD) from a distance without having any physical connection to the machine being monitored, and without the knowledge of the person being observed? 

This was one of several reports prepared for the United Nations from 1959-1980. See e.g. The Abolition of the Death Penalty in International Law, By William A. Schabas at pp.156ff. One notable report was by the eminent French jurist Marc Ancel, who concluded "all the information available appears to confirm that such a removal [of the death penalty] has, in fact, never been followed by a notable rise in the incidence of the crime no longer punishable with death." It is worth noting that when these studies began in the 1950's the majority of UN state members were "retentionist" (i.e. they retained capital punishment, as opposed to abolitionist). In 1977, only 16 or so countries were considered abolitionist (not having a penalty of death), whereas by 2012 that number was around 97. In other words, the studies were commissioned and paid for by the United Nations at a time when the organization was predominantly composed of states that employed capital punishment. Conclusion State-sponsored killing of people in the name of capital punishment is ostensibly justified because it prevents further crimes. This deterrence falls into two categories, specific deterrence (i.e. recidivism by the convicted) and general deterrence (i.e. dissuasion of potential murderers other than the convicted). As a specific deterrent capital punishment has no known benefits over life imprisonment. As a general deterrent, there has never been a study indicating that the state of mind of any murderer has ever been influenced by the possibility of capital punishment. Further, no jurisdiction has ever been mentioned for having a decrease in crime rates because it implemented capital punishment. A persuasive counter-argument by an advocate of capital punishment ought to explain the dramatic drop in murder rates after Canada abolished it, the opinion of the majority of US criminologists and Justice Marshall, and the comprehensive academic and UN reports indicating an absence of deterrence from capital punishment. No such counter-argument has been forthcoming. Which is all to say that capital punishment is not known to be an effective deterrent for murder. Please permit one final quote from Professor Lamperti:
