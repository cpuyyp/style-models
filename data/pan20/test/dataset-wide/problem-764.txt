I'm not entirely sure, but I would guess that it's simply because the discoverer suggested it. After a few steps in the process of characterizing an asteroid's orbit, the discoverer gets to suggest a name (within reason) to a committee. The full guidelines are available at the relevant IAU webpage. (It's longer than is worth reproducing here.) Note that there are plenty of "celebrity" asteroids, drawn from a wide range of human endeavours: Adamsmith, Balzac, Beethoven, Megryan, etc. If anything, I'm surprised that an asteroid wasn't named Nimoy sooner. There's already a Mr. Spock! 

I think the misunderstanding is that it's not that explosive when the star "lights up". The process is in some sense continuous, so the nuclear reactions start slowly and gradually increase in strength as the star continues to contract, grow, and heat up inside. Once the amount of radiation from the surface becomes sufficiently hot, we can speak of "blowing away" material, but even then it's not violent. The absorption of light in the gas creates a pressure that pushes the gas away. It picks up pace as the star settles down (and depending on how massive the star is), but it's broadly a consistent stream. (Astronomers are probably unwise to use the word "ignite" because all we mean is that the nuclear reaction rates become non-negligible. It's not like a rocket taking off or something.) Generally, star formation is a poorly-understood process and a hot topic for research. For stars larger than about 7 solar masses, we think that nuclear reactions begin before all the material has gathered in the star. i.e. while some is still flowing on. If this happens through a disk, then the light can stream out everywhere but the equator without much affecting the growth of the star. That said, at very high masses, you do run into a problem of blowing mass away. For this reason, we don't really expect to see many stars over a few hundred solar masses, and those that are can be violently unstable (like Eta Carina, which threw off about 10 solar masses of material in the mid-19th century). And as for stars genuinely "blowing up", this does happen in other circumstances. For example, in the core of a solar mass red giant, matter becomes nearly isothermal. It eventually gets hot enough to ignite helium, and it nearly all lights up at nearly the same time in a helium flash. This briefly produces as much light as a small galaxy! But only very briefly, and it doesn't make it to the surface for us to see. Incidentally, this is also the same mechanism as Type Ia supernovae: an isothermal carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes matter until the carbon lights up, and the whole white dwarf basically ignites at the same time. 

I'd say it's very hard to get an accurate (or even precise) age just given a single spectrum. Currently, the spectrum would probably first be used to determine $T_\text{eff}$ and $\log g$, and thus values would then be used as inputs in the stellar model. Remember: I'm talking about interior models, so they don't typically produce a model atmosphere to compare. You've then already got the issue that there are more parameters than observables. This is resolved by supposing that the mixing length parameter is the same as the best-fitting values for the Sun (for which we have much more data) and that the abundances of helium and metals are correlated. (We call this an enrichment law.) This makes the problem tractable, because the high-resolution spectrum should also tell us the metal content. Knowing the evolutionary state is easier, I think, because the surface gravity should help you to distinguish, especially given a high resolution spectrum. As said, I'm no expert here, and I'm aware that misclassification can happen with multi-colour photometry, but I don't expect it to happen with high-res spectra. If you'd like to read further, here are some quick resources that might be of interest. First, some lecture notes on determining stellar ages recently appeared on arXiv: 

If your question is why the star starts moving up the red giant branch, it's in essence because of the behaviour of the surface opacity and the development of a substantial convective envelope in order to meet the surface boundary condition. It's basically the Hayashi track in reverse. We can say this because if you create a model of a star and artificially suppress convection in the equations, then the model just keeps getting colder and colder at roughly constant luminosity, instead of ascending the giant branch. See e.g. Fig. 2 of Stancliffe et al. (2009). Note that the star still becomes large in terms of radius, just not bright. 

As you say, making black holes quickly in the early Universe is a major unsolved problem in astrophysics. There are various hypotheses, of which two roughly correspond to supermassive stars. All basically involve trying to give the black hole a headstart in mass. There isn't really enough time to grow a $100\,M_\odot$ black hole to $10^9\,M_\odot$, so the idea is to rather get something more massive than a few $\times1000\,M_\odot$. The most recent review I know of offhand is probably Volonteri (2010), but I'm not up to date on the literature. Basically, imagine a few hundred thousand solar masses of gas collapsing into a primordial galaxy. As the gas collapses, it potentially fragments, depending on whether or not it can cool efficiently. If so, the fragments can presumably form stars, but in a very dense cluster. Ultimately, either (a) the massive stars in the cluster collapse into black holes that then merge into a larger black hole, which can subsequently accrete its way to supermassiveness (supermass?); or (b) the individual stars first merge in the centre, creating a star of perhaps some thousands of solar masses, which would collapse into a massive black hole that could grow. If the primordial galactic cloud doesn't fragment, we expect a sort of monolithic collapse. Somewhere in the middle, gas will start to reach hydrostatic equilibrium: a protostar forms. But it's a protostar that's potentially accreting several solar masses of material per year (or even faster). So what happens next depends on whether that rapidly infall of material has to time to reach local thermal equilibrium with the protostar, or if it just piles up on the outside. If the former, then the protostar can become very large: thousands or tens of thousands of solar masses, which, like the supermerger product above, presumably leaves a massive black hole in the end. If the small protostar evolves independently of the infalling gas, it's probably also big enough to leave a black hole, just a much smaller one: tens, maybe hundreds of solar masses. But it's a black hole embedded in this enormous cloud of infalling gas, which potentially settles into an envelope around the black hole. This structure has been dubbed a "quasi-star", and the black hole inside can grow very rapidly in this cocoon. Eventually, the envelope will evaporate/disperse, leaving the now massive black hole to continue to accrete its way to supermassiveness. Note that these formation mechanisms are expected to be particular to the early Universe. Once you add even a small amount of metals to the gas, then star formation is expected to look much more like the "modern" Universe. In fact, star formation in these scenarios is still far from settled. The main reason is that you need to follow how the gas evolves from the scale of the protogalaxy all the way down to the protostars inside. This is a range of scales something like $1\,\mathrm{AU}/10,000\,\mathrm{ly}\approx10^{-9}$, which is numerically very difficult. And, finally, to answer the question directly, in neither of the supermassive star options do the stars really collapse in supermassive black holes. SMBHs are so big that they can only have grown so large through accretion. The supermassive stars would collapse into their progenitors (or "seeds"), which would subsequently grow to such large masses.
