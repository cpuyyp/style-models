When I was younger, it seemed most mountain bike shocks had rubber boots on them, but now most seem to be "naked." 

People generally reuse hubs rather than rims because of the cost and lifespan differential. That said, as long as the spoke count and dish/pattern* is the same, you should be ok. 

I have a new bike with 160mm rotors and Avid BB5 brakes. I wanted to step up to Avid BB7 brakes as they seem easier to adjust. The BB7s come packaged with rotor options -- 160 / 180 / 200 mm. 

I've almost done this (gotten the valve lost inside the rim) trying to inflate a tire. It's not hard and it could even conceivably happen as a tire self-deflated. 

You could also try to emulate how the Sondors ebike has a hard triangular shaped box in the diamond frame that is quite capacious - here it has a bottle battery but many people have stuffed them with RC type square lipos: 

Corrosion, UV, oxidation, and liquid protection for frame materials that can corrode or oxidize (namely steel) or might get damaged by UV (carbon fiber, wood, polymer, or the glues used in such) Abrasion protection Marketing and looking flash 

One word: Sugru. It's a great self-curing plastic that allows you to "hack" your shoes in all sorts of ways. You can knead in a bit of it to make sure the tightest buckle position is blocked. You can use it to add a lip to the release to make it easier to grab. You can use it to repair your shoes. Next to ShoeGoo and gaffer's tape, it's the Best Thing in the UniverseÂ®. You can get it at $URL$ -- and sadly no, I don't get any kickbacks from them otherwise I'd be a millionaire, as I evangelize it as much as I can. :-) 

One thing to keep in mind is the availability of parts. I have a Dahon in Tokyo and the local bike shops there don't always have the 20" tubes and have to order away. You might want to bring a couple of inner tubes (and depending on how long you're there, some tires). Also, while in Tokyo I broke a folding pedal off my Dahon. This is one of the weak areas of the standard Dahon design as it uses plastics/composites in the folding pedal. I had to wait a couple of weeks for this to be special ordered. If I had replaced it with a non-folding pedal, I could have had a replacement immediately, but then I couldn't fold the bike in half any more. I replaced it with a metal folding pedal that is much more solid. In conclusion, if you'll be in India for a while you might want to stock up on: 

The three-speed Sturmey Archer internal gear hubs are a bit less complex, but still I wouldn't take one apart for the lulz. 

An allen key may not be giving you enough torque -- you may want to use a hex bit on a socket wrench or torque wrench. You'd have to give us the specs on the hex bolt for us to look up the appropriate amount of torque -- but it's certainly more than you could get with an allen key. But be careful of using a socket wrench as that may give you so much torque that you snap the bolt or split the steerer tube -- the use of a torque wrench is strongly recommended. It sometimes helps if you can take the quill stem out, use alcohol to remove any residual oil off of the wedge. You can also rough up the outside of wedge a bit with a file. Some people also use coarse grit (lapping compound) or carbon-fiber assembly paste to increase the friction and reduce galling risk. You may want to grease the hole at the top of the stem quill where the wedge bolt enters as well as the surfaces between the quill and the wedge to reduce friction. If the bolt has a habit of loosening itself, you could use blue Loctite on the bolt threads. But the main problem is that with BSOs, the tolerances are so poor that something is either too tight and galled into place, or so sloppy that no end of tightening will get you solid tight without breaking something else. And sometimes the drones at the factory do something truly idiotic like put a 25.4mm stem into a 26.00 steerer tube. 

There's only 2mm on each of the rear triangles has to move. Sheldon Brown has an elaborate system using strings to make sure that the motion is symmetrical but I think this is rather overkill for anything but the most expensive/vintage bikes. I cold set my 1975 Peugeot UO-18 to use a 9-speed cassette with no issue. 

Plastic fenders: If the fender is made of plastic or wood, then there is a metal L-bracket underneath the brake calipers bolt that holds the fender on. This bracket needs to be bent just a tad so that the fender is at a better angle viz a viz the wheel. It's easier to bend this with the fender removed as you can crack a plastic or wood fender. Finishing Touches: After you've done all that, you can put some polyurethane or hot glue on the sliders to help them grip a bit more. I like to use glues that I can easily take off again. One brand I like is ShoeGoo. It is incredibly tough and tacky but you can also get it off hard plastics and metals if you need to readjust the fenders again. 

This may be more of a comment rather than an answer but you seem to think the only alternative to a road bike is a mountain bike. Have you considered getting either a cyclocross or a touring bike with drop bars? These have a similar look and geometry to a road bike but are built much more strongly. 

It could just be bad luck. Or, there may be a piece of glass, a tack/nail, or caltrop stuck in your tire in a way that wasn't visible to the shop that replaced your inner tube. It may be deeply embedded in the rubber tread, invisible on both sides, and only pierce the inner tube when under both air pressure and the weight of a rider. When you or the shop changes the inner tube yet again, they should keep track of the orientation of the inner tube to the outer tire and where the puncture is. They should triple-check the outer tire casing at the location of the puncture. Or it could be bad luck. 

Mattnz's answer is canonical and addresses aluminum, steel, and titanium frames. Until we can easily 3d print metal frames, custom frames are going to be tube based. Hydroforming metal for one-off bikes isn't worth it and you can't easily braze aluminum (you have to TIG weld it). But this leaves out another important material (as Chris H notes): carbon fiber. If you want your own custom bike that has a radical (non-tubular) shape, you should do your own carbon fiber layups. This is something that you can do DIY as well as ask a custom CF builder to do. And it can be literally any shape you want, within engineering limitations. 

tldr; You need a new light. Get a new one based on 18650 or larger, rechargeable lithium batteries. As David Richerby notes, buy the best light you can afford. You'll save more over the long term as money buys durability. 

Mid Seat: The child-seats that are either immediately behind the handlebars can be found in the aftermarket. But as the bottom left image in the google-image-search above, you can see that some seat designs will cause knee-strike. Generally these should be avoided unless it's for a very small child or your bike is on the larger side and there's no risk of knee strike. Front Seat: The bike seats that are placed in front of or on top of the handlebars are usually custom to that bicycle as they depend on the shape of the handlebars or front wheel.
