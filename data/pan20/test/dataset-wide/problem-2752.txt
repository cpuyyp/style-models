By multi-meaning-messages I mean the capability of the people to convey communication with different significance (sometimes even opposite) to different target audiences/constituencies AND such information co-habit. It could be considered lie but due to status of the emitter is not handled as such. The emitter of the message is aware of it and use it as a tool to expand/keep its influence for example. Most of the receivers are not aware of it. I had been noticing that philosophy plays an important role for effectiveness on absorption of the messages by different targets. Examples 1: [As Lewandowsky says about the billionaires supporting rightwing populism: “Theirs are very personal motives and probably not the motives these people will admit to themselves. There are very few people who say, ‘I’m greedy and I like being greedy.’ Instead they will say, ‘I’m a libertarian and I believe that society is best served if free individuals pursue their own interests.’”] $URL$ Example 2: When persons use the term "democracy" they might mean "democratism". Example 3: When persons use the terms "Nation:State" they might mean "Oligarchy:Corporation". The picture tries to capture that sometimes the multi-meaning-messages can run very deep and does not spread fast... 

Maybe this help: [Definition: A necessary condition for some state of affairs S is a condition that must be satisfied in order for S to obtain.] [Definition: A sufficient condition for some state of affairs S is a condition that, if satisfied, guarantees that S obtains.] From here. It has got examples and a tests. ☺ 

Philosophy is a tool. It is a good tool. If the tool is used properly it will benefit our daily lives. If we do not use it properly it will not benefit. Philosophy used properly: .. An illiterate and handicap mother in Africa which just lost her youngest child due to malaria... An western person who is familiar with philosophy OR not and finds a way to support organizations who are capable to reach those who are struggling. Philosophy is about DOING good! Philosophy not used properly: .. Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem quoting Immanuel Kant to justify his terrible works. The picture tries to illustrate how philosophy can help the person to navigate from a war contributor to a peace contributor... 

Good question. Maybe if Kant would had access to our knowledge today would he would update his thought. He was a genius, no doubt. It seems to me that noumena [(in the sense they are the (supposed/.../presumed) things themselves, which we in lack of better concept so far, we say: reality] impose certain constraints to life which has got thinking ability and life with thinking ability responds to such constraints with a set of heuristics which moral/ethics/.../"what works" are examples and maybe are just byproducts of thinking ability. So, in the end if we eliminate free will we have to start to find another heuristic to deal with it and moral & cia are not enough for it. Now, with AI (artificial intelligence, which I prefer to name artificial integration) we just lost ANOTHER degree of freedom... so it is about time to think about the reduction of freedom implies in terms of the "next" heuristic... After all we are just algorithms producing biochemistry and bio-electrical signs. See for example the book of the picture... ☺ 

Good question. SUV is a car but we call it SUV assuming that is a car. Enlightenment is a religion but we call it Enlightenment assuming that religion is detached from Enlightenment. It seems it is not possible for our little brains to split religion AND something such as science, capitalism, communism, clubism, statism, enlightenment and so for... things emerge from other things... As Max Planck put it "For religion, God is at the beginning; for science, God is at the end." See more, for example, in God Is a Person Reflections of Two Nobel Laureates. Religion is embedded everywhere. ☺ It seems to me The Analyst, by George Berkeley, 1734 was a superior exercise to make sense of things which worried him then. It was so good that even today we revisit it. Read, please, the text of the image the way it is presented and then read it replacing "I" by "Religion" ☺ 

Don't anthropomorphize God. It doesn't have to necessarily be a being with feelings. It might just be a system that hosts beings to evolve, that have feelings. Flooding the earth in SimCity isn't horrible at all to the computer that causes the event. 

No, it wouldn't, it would be better. If all beings were to act good, synergy will be formed, hence everybody would live a happier live. "Would it be better if everyone was good?" Yes. 

This answer is based on the following assumption: It is better to have experience accompanied by knowledge, than just knowledge. So lets try the following to (hopefully) gain experience. See it as me proving to you that you can discern between states of dreaming and states of wakefulness, I can't just do that with solely you reading text I typed, you have to do something. This is based on the assumption that reality is more than just intellect. The other (right) half of your brain is also involved in processing your reality, and that is the emotional/experimental aspect. So do the exercise below, please: 

What it says, in my perspective is, is analogous to the following: You don't specifically need software application A to show the logical behavior of transistors inside a CPU. You could also do that with software application B. So here software application A and B are the subject matter, or the content terms. Where as the behavior of the CPU is the abstract level you are proving the logical behavior of. Here is another example. The concept of addition. Here I proof the logical validity of addition: "When I take 3 apples, and I take 2 apples more, and put these inside a bag, I have 5 apples in my bag." The logical concept proven here doesn't require an example with apples. It could have been any example to explain the concept op addition. So the subject matter of apples inside a bag is not important to proof the logical form of addition. If apples would be required, its not an abstract logical concept. As logic doesn't apply to specific matter. Math for example doesn't only apply to the stock market, but applies on the whole universe. 

You might be very interested in reading this book: $URL$ I read it 5/6 so far, its really life perspective changing and very positive and constructive. Its the best book I read about truth and consciousness so far, and I read quiet a few. With its logical assessments and derivations, it truly is a Big Theory of Everything. 

This is something you can teach yourself, just like playing the piano. The point of this is that you self-reflect that you are not doing anymore what you want to do and get back at it. Google on "lucid dreaming and fMRI" and you will have biological evidence that areas in the brain of self reflection are more active during lucid(conscious/awake) dreaming, than non lucid dreaming. That your mind is wondering of is because the angst/anxiety is controlling you (or you let it control you). First you will experience those fears that are just beneath the conscious surface. The more you practice the exercise above, the more angst you will discover that lies deep down inside you. When you know/experience they are there, you can do something about it, recude them, and take control. Can you imagine, that those fears that live deep down inside you, that almost never get to the surface, influence very much of your daily life experience? As long as there are others things controlling you (or you are letting them control you) you have less control than you could possible have: you are dreaming. This has thought me that I am dreaming often throughout the day, while almost anybody would say they are perfectly awake and not dreaming at all. That is because I am not skilled enough yet to constantly think about what I want and act upon that. The exercise above gives me more control of experience life because I can put more into it of how I want it to be, because of reducing the fears. I even start living at night: consciously experiencing the dream reality. Its starts with playing around (like children learn their environment) but it becomes more than that. You can really practice overcoming fears and use strong willpower (intention) to create what you want and see the effects immediately. So the give one concrete answer to your question: You know you aren't dreaming in some aspect when you have consciously created what you wanted in that aspect that has created synergy (more than there was). I use aspect because again, this isn't a binary state. It is not that you create all that you(with good intention) desire, or you create nothing at all. That would also imply there is an ending state. But combining stuff to create synergy is endless. It is fact you can create partially, step by step, what you desire: the house, spouse, children, work, quality time you desire, as long as it creates synergy. That is how your consciousness grows. Look up things like: 

I have pondered this for a while and I think that authority is a modern bastardization of an older concept. When you study something enough, you gain the knowledge that enables you to author a book on the subject. In the development of language, authorities in a subject often invent new terms to denote specific elements within the subject. Someone who wants to engage the subject, perhaps, for example, to learn to cook, will find an expert or "authority" from whom to learn. When a subject uses authority to control an object, the object necessarily loses its intrinsic control. Really, this never happens, but we are made to feel it happen when, for example, we are threatened into obeying. One may say that "you can't break the law" and this is true for real laws, like the law of gravity and the conservation of momentum, but for human laws that are made up by legislators, it's obviously not true. We still say it, and that evidences a kind of superstition, as Larken Rose puts it. Power, on the other hand, is simply the ability to control. One may say that the difference between the (coercive) authority you mean in your question and "power" is that authority only exists because of the disposition (superstition, belief, abdication of conscience, whatever) of the object, whereas power exists regardless of the internal state of the object. 

Let's all be philosophers who look "at how to reconcile how much in our daily experience we trust beliefs we get from knowledge and the philosophical intuition that those beliefs do not constitute knowledge proper." Perhaps your question asked about an existing philosopher who has done this because your interest in philosophy is heavily tilted toward a reliance on authorities ;-). When I heard that Socrates made the claim that we cannot know anything, I liked that claim. I have taken it up as my own claim as well. What we can do is define things, and if we provide definitions that are simple enough, then others can use the same thing in the same way and we can achieve some agreement. For example, we defined 2 and + and = and 4, so we can agree that 2+2=4, and we all "know" what it means. Well, we all define what it means. But we use the word know to mean something, and we would be well served to be more honest about it. That's what I think your question seeks: honesty. I have three children. They and my wife used to ask me if I was sure when I answered a question, sometimes. At first (and probably long before I got married), I would put a sureness-measure on my answer: "99.44% sure." Since I liked math, I imagined I was saying that the present circumstances could present themselves ten thousand times, and I think I'd be right in all but 56 of them. I suppose that I have decided that I will claim knowledge when the chances I estimate of being wrong are one in a million, though ten thousand also seems big enough, to say I know it. I still say I'm sure when it's one out of a hundred or more, but by now everyone I talk to knows what "I'm sure" means when I say it. Ok, so let's reconcile authority with knowledge. There are two kinds of authority, one of which is actually fake. The fake authorities say "It's my way or you go to jail." They use brutality and violence rather than reason. They suck. Can we say that here? Well, they do, and that's why. The other kind is people who study so much that they're aware of a lot more in a particular area than the rest of us. If they disagree with what we say about a particular thing, they're probably right because... they're an authority. The reason that's a fallacy is that probably isn't good enough. To be good enough, you have to go through all the work the authority did (and if they did it well, that shouldn't take too long). Fallacies are dangerous, but most people learn that they've used a fallacy by suffering (not dying), so they aren't all that dangerous. The fallacy of appeal to authority is difficult to see (but it's getting easier because of fake authority) because most authorities (but see my previous parenthetical) actually do pretty good work. If they use threats instead of reason, then you can write them off. Knowledge does not come from coercion.
