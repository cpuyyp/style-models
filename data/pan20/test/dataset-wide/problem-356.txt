Rare and precious experiences maybe, but outside of novelty of experience or self-identity construction, why would people value these so highly in most cases? 

If you stretch the definition of cell, I don't see why it couldn't be big in a low- or zero-g environment. It's going to be wildly more complex than a microscopic cell due to the size alone. I have a hard time imagining it being more like a cell than a highly complex multicellular organism, though. Even if it looks like a single-celled Eukaryote it's going to be vastly more complicated than any life form ever encountered by humanity. Major questions will involve why it would get so big, but we're deep into fantastic territory anyways with this. As for surviving in space... that's harder. Problems include: 

The company apparently has unlimited resources, but are there any constraints on them at all? If not, there would seem to be a lot of options. Deployable nets? Electric current, like electric eels? Mesmerizing color patterns, like cuttlefish? Baiting the whales with a chemical or physical lure but moving faster than they can catch, leading them into whale pens? Superheated or explosive chemical discharge, like bombardier beetles? Concussive blasts based on water pressure, like pistol shrimp? A paralytic or deadly toxin? A toxoplasmosis-like infection that makes whales attracted to capture areas? 

Given the overwhelming similarity of most day-to-day experiences (unless you've got some wild social/experiential setup), the passive accumulation of experience likely wouldn't be worth much. Especially if qualia cannot be destroyed, inflation should quickly drive the relative value of most individual qualia to virtually nothing. Most people will be poor by dint of the commonness of their life experience. 

This is similar to the above. If we're talking about forming your own identity or dealing in rarity, then maybe. Otherwise, a lot of daily experience seems like it would be valued as trash. tl;dr: As laid out, I don't see why people would use qualia as currency if they had other options, as the subjective value of different experiences would leave qualia with wildly diverging values. It would be more like a bartering system than a currency. Answering the question of why people would choose to use qualia will set the stage for the actual use of the currency. If you're set on this system, the society in which it operates will have to be molded to fit, and that involves arbitrary choices on your part. 

Key Question: How are these subsistence-farming, blacksmithing humans producing/finding these batteries? Why is it that the androids can't or prefer not to produce or find the batteries themselves? Answer to question as posed: Infinite ways. There really isn't a limit on how this might work. Addiction and reward systems, as outlined by Renan, could do it. But to make the servitude really invisible I think the best tool is going to be control of historical information. Time is on the side of the immortal machines, and so minor changes over time can really add up. Human society could be manipulated via introduction of new cultural or social standards in which service to the machines is highly valued, and people self-organize to be of as much use as possible. The humans' religion might be an especially handy tool for this. If the machines control information, they could provide "help" in the humans pursuing something that they know humans will never achieve (maybe it's impossible but humans don't have the knowledge to be aware of that, for example) in exchange for service. If the humans don't have a good way to record historical information over time, they might never know how little progress they've made over countless generations. If informational manipulation doesn't work for you, the machines could monopolize some necessary resource, like water, via ordinary acquisition or subversion (like draining away all potable water into a supply the machines exclusively can access, or poisoning the sources humans can easily reach) and then effectively enslave the humans through trade. Which method might they choose, and why? With so many options, answering the question of why the androids would bother to rely on the human population at all for access to batteries will help narrow down which specific methods might best fit their situation. 

I'd like to join the chorus but if everyone does, things get boring, so I choose not to: Your knight got screwed. He has a small island but no "anchor points" on either side of the river. The existing bridge likely already has an owner (There are other lords on either river bank, right?) who will be displeased to have the bridge taken away. The king promised "the new lord will be able to collect plenty of taxes" probably without ensuring to keep it. After all, he said nothing about water rights. Well that's politics. However his situation is not too bad, if he's clever (and a bit ruthless) First he needs to find out the status of the bridge. 

Finding out the claims does not need to be easy. There's no central register. Any close city might have something in their records but a written contract in some private drawer might be lurking around, too. In medieval times credits were usually paid back by nobles in terms of "royalties" (pun likely not coincidental but etymological). The noble got money now in exchange for lending his rights at something later like a source of tax income for a certain amount of time. This means the bridge as a tax source might be lend off to a rich family (the forerunner of banks) only to fall back to him after the time agreed in advance expires. The bank gambles on the income in the near future. They will calculate carefully to make sure they'll get their share. This might already be the case. If so, the bank has a strong but time-limited claim. If not, any other claim (by other lords) can be circumvented: The knight should address the king with concerns about the state and load of the bridge. He proposes to reduce the load on the already run-down (even if it's not) bridge to allow for repairs, if he gets in writing the right for taxing any new and old bridge located once the length from his island to the capital downstream and twice upstream (supposing the capital is located upstream, otherwise vice versa) regardless of previous arrangements. If he's able to get that, he has royal decree that nullifies any claims and ensures he will always have the closest bridge to the capital. Plus he doesn't need to repair the old bridge, because he only assured to allow for not actually pay for repairs on his own. Next he gets a credit lending out tax rights on the old bridge. The bank is bound to ask for the use of the money: "Constructions, I want to invest in my land to make it prosper by attracting more trade." The bank will likely agree, because more trade means more income from the bridge, which they will get. Now the old bridge isn't of any concern for him. He already got a fixed share of the money beforehand. If there are any claims: Sort them out with the bank yourself! He invests the money into building a new bridge. The bank will be pissed, because he'll be cutting their tax income with the new bridge: "But I said I'll invest in constructions!" With the two concurrent bridges, tax will be low attracting many merchants. The knight can increase the tax, as soon as the old bridge falls back to him. In case there are strong claims over the old bridge, he can also sabotage it. He should only do so after the bank's claim expired. No need to anger them too much. Now for water rights: He can have some bandits coming along the river. Attracting bandits shouldn't be too hard. If everything else fails, have some loyal men play them. The bandits anger the king a little. And the knight reports his watch saw a boat escape along the river around that time. However he was unable to do anything and still is, unless he's allowed to deploy some chains across the river to stop and check travelers. This should clarify water rights right away. Now the Knight owns two sources of income: 

Religion Procreating is bad and must be forbidden except on the only one holy day each year/decade were you are all permitted to try procreating once and only once, for thy great ancient lords told ya so. Thou shalt not make babies when thy lord didn't allow you. Beware citizens, being X is watching you. 

I think such combat robots might be usefull. Let's consider why. Firstly, today we're using flying combat drones that are really effecient to supplant conventional aircrafts. They can sustain much higher speed, because you don't have to care about a human suffering from g forces inside your drone. Nonetheless, even if they're pretty efficient they have the same problem all aircrafts got. When you're fighting in higly dense area, like forests, mountains, towns, these sort of drones tends to be less adapted. Secondly, you might think then "Eyh let's use flying drones with propellers, these would act like helicopters and works perfectly". Helicopters are far more adapted to urban environment for sure. Nonetheless that's the kind of hard to maintain equipement, I can't find my source anymore but I read somewhere on world building SE that helicopters had a ton of drawbacks preventing armies from having hundreds of thousands of these instead of using trucks. On top of that, even with no drawbacks, you're not going to fight inside buildings with such drones. And you definitely can't do it either in forests. So then another solution is using drones with wheels/tracks or perhaps many legs, but not humanoid shaped with two legs and two arms. Wheels and tracks ? Not adapted to difficult terrains too. Many legs ? Means more cost, will be more stable and more efficient than two legs robots. At least, robots with legs would have that advantages animals and humans got to move on almost every kind of terrain. But then why giving arms/heads/eveyrthing that defines a human shape to a robot ? Well perhaps for military it's no use at first, in combat situation a robot do not need arms, it can have turret mounted weapons most likely and accessories to supplant arms, it does not need a head either, or not the same one we human got. But outside of fighting ? Don't your drones have any other goal than just to fight ? A soldier does not fight each second of his life. He need to do things that could require arms, like building stuff (fortifications most likely), or transporting supplies, or doing some maintenance tasks, even help the civilians (don't forget today's armies are often used to provide assistance to civilians in case of natural disaster)s. Last point for me would be : Civilian use and war economy. If the army is producing drones for it's own purposes, it is very likely the civilian industry will produce drones to. If they are enough advanced, people would really like to have a robot with which they can talk and live. And I guess everyone likes more to live with something that mimics living beings (so cats or dogs, or even human-shaped robots) than with weirds robots looking like a tank. Would you like to talk to a tank in your dinning room ? If yes, then you're really hardcore sir ! But anyway this is not the point. If drones are produced by the civilian economy, esthetics factors (like humanoid shaped robots) needs to be taken into account for customers, thus having humanoid like robots makes sense. And when war will break out, all the robots produced by the civilian industry would make perfect second hand drones to use as military stuff. They'll just need to be refitted a little, like adding a new shape with a bit of armor, creating some programms to teach them how to fire, and give them small fire arms and here you are, cheap robots fighters coming from the civilian industry without any need to heavily convert your civilian factories into military factories. Easy isn't it ? Even easier than converting cars factories into tank factories. It would most likely give a great advantage in the case of a total war, to have at once a full stock of ready-to-be-converted robots. The best is, before any war breaks, the country using such method would be considered pretty weak "Eyh look at them they have such a small army, they are no threat to us." And then the war breaks, and millions of civilians robots are turned into fellow fearless soldiers, ready to fight for the mother/father - land.
