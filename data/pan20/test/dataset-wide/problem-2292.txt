According to the USDA, thornless versions are available, which is likely the kind my apartment complex purchased and planted: 

There is a light outside my apartment door that likely is what attracted this guy in originally, but even at night time, it just sits here. This isn't the first time I've witnessed a moth do this before either. How are moths able to do this, and why do they do this? 

I can't say for sure if this site is autoritive or not, but it does say that shaving your legs makes it more difficult for a tick to stick to you: 

I have friends who swear by silk inners. They are thin, so can be worn under other gloves, but are extremely warm for the thickness. Combine these with windstopper outers - as mentioned elsewhere, layering is good practice. On the downside, silk is really expensive, at least where I live. On the upside, silk lasts a long time and doesn't get smelly. 

Growing up in rural New Zealand, we often encountered electric fences. Some of them were illegally high-powered to deal with big animals. We tested fences either with the back of our hands or with a piece of grass. As specified a few times in this question (thanks @Michael Martinez), using the back of the hand is for safety. An electric shock can cause muscles to clench. If you place your hand around the wire and get shocked then you risk being unable to unclench your hand. Using the back of the hand, with the palm away from any wires, means that if a shock clenches your muscles then your hand and arm move away from the wires. An anecdote: A mate of mine grew up on a farm used for Sweetwaters (a popular music festival a few decades ago). He says that the combination of stoned hippies and electric fences was extremely entertaining. In answer to another question above, I have a cousin who peed on an electric fence. It was not a pleasant experience (for him, anyway, his mates were laughing their heads off). 

This got me curious, & using Expansion anchors in construction applications got me looking. While I couldn't find anything specific to climbing applications & submersion, I did find a reference to 304 or 316 stainless steel being used in submerged marine environments (harsher than typical freshwater) by boat builders. To my knowledge, no expansion anchors are available in 304 SS, so you would be limited to 316. I did come across this fastener selector tool which does specifically mention expansion anchors being used in submerged applications (in concrete). It is worth noting that even bolts installed in high, dry desert locations will need to be replaced sooner or later, so it is a good bet that the more extreme environment will shorten their lifespan no matter what you do. Also, maybe of more importance here, is making certain not to allow different alloys to come into contact with one another for extended periods. Do not use two different alloys for the bolt & the nut, & if you leave your hangers on the bolts when not in use, make sure that they are stainless steel also. Allowing dissimilar metals to remain in contact with water will result in Galvanic Corrosion. Which essentially means the rusting process will happen much faster. Just a thought, but you may want to be especially wary if the bolts are installed in sandstone with a high Iron content, as it seems to me that the Iron in the sandstone could react much more strongly with the stainless in a submerged environment. Anyone else have any observations on the effects (or non-effects) of Iron containing sandstone on anchor bolts? My two cents; give it a try. Maybe just very carefully inspect each bolt before use after a submersion. Edit: It may also be worth firing an email off to a manufacturer: $URL$ Edit: Edit: Just did, waiting for response. Edit(x3): Didn't hear back from Fixe, so I emailed Hilti customer service with the following question: 

If you are roped up for glacier travel and the person in front of you has just fallen in then you can hammer a snow stake in to provide an anchor. Note that in this case you probably won't have your ice axe available since it will be stuck in the ground with your knee bracing it, holding up your mate. I've not seen the shorter stakes (the snow flukes) in the photo in action. 

Red Rock Canyon & Valley of Fire have very heavy human visitation, so any large predators are likely to be scarce (Mountain Lions & Bobcats). Coyotes are present, but unless cornered will not give you any problems. The mostly likely encounter with 'dangerous' wildlife you might have would be with Rattle Snakes. There are several species, some more aggressive than others, found in the Mojave & Great Basin regions, although they are not very active during the colder winter months during which you are planning on visiting, however may seek out warm areas near humans. I have spent several years hiking & camping in the Mojave & have only ever come across exactly 3 rattlesnakes. Also remember that rattle snakes will not always rattle, especially if cold. There are several species of scorpions as well, however the stings of most are really no worse than a wasp sting, unless you have immune system issues or a particular sensitivity. (There are wasps too). The scorpion present in southern Nevada with the most potential for a deadly sting is the Arizona Bark Scorpion, it is to my knowledge not native, but I have found them in Las Vegas, most likely an introduced population or a lone hitchhiker. Note the wide body & coloring for identification. Scorpions are also not very active in colder months, however may seek out warm areas near humans as well. 

I asked my fitness instructor this question a few years ago. She had several things to say. Electrolyte replacement is for when you have been in a high cardio, sweating mode continually for an hour or more. Endurance runners and cyclists, yes. Gym bunnies, trampers, walkers, no. Very few things on the market are actually true electrolyte replacement. Almost all the things in the fridge at your local store with things like "vitamin water" on the label are just soft drinks, full of sugar and caffeine. She said that in New Zealand there were only two proper electrolyte replacement products you could buy without going to a specialty sports shop. As an aside, you can usually tell a decent one by the fact they taste metallic and "slimy". :-) For long distance hiking (6 hours or more) she suggested that if I suffered from headaches on the drive home then perhaps I could put a bottle of electrolyte replacement in the car and drink it at the end of the trip. Otherwise, I should stick to water and the usual hiking snacks of peanuts, crackers, dried fruit and so on. In the gym, she said there should be nothing but water in my bottle and I should replace water lost exactly. I should stand on the scales with my full water bottle at the beginning of the workout and stand on the scales with my empty water bottle at the end of the workout and the two weights should be the same. 

You've got most of it down already. Cooking away from your sleeping area is always a good precaution, and never eat or bring food into your tent. A PDF from CapitolRiders.org points out some of the precautions you can take: 

I've noticed that there is a moth on the outside of my apartment door that has been just sitting there for two days now: 

Another source doesn't say it will help prevent them from sticking to you, but it does say it'll help you feel them sooner, allowing you to get them off of you before they latch on: 

Don't freeze the bottle - fill it with ice cubes. Better still, don't use ice cubes, use ice sticks that fit in the neck of bottles. 

Given that it is above the mesh pocket at the side, my guess is that it is for walking/ski poles. If you need to put the poles away for a short time (for example, a traverse using your ice axe, a river crossing), you don't need to go to the trouble of loosening the compression straps (the ones holding the tent poles in the photos above). 

A similar caution should be taken with Desert Bighorn Sheep. Although you are unlikely to get near them, males will act aggressively if they feel they need to defend their herd. Black Widow spiders & Tarantulas are also present. Though neither are actively aggressive towards humans. One other thing to watch out for; the Teddy Bear Cholla. If you have an unexpected encounter with one of these, you will not soon forget it! Bits of them will, shall we say stick with you. 

Your technique of cooking/eating at one site and then moving to the next should work perfectly (so long as they are far enough apart - I imagine they are). As for disposing of the byproducts of cooking, I would dump anything that won't harm the environment even further away from the cooking site so that others who may use the site won't be in danger. I would think that grease shouldn't impact the environment so it should be safe to dump. For things that you should not just leave (things that constitute as pollution), you can use another bear bag or garbage bag to hold all of these things and hang it just like you would with your food. It may be smarter to hang this one separately from and further from the bear bag that contains your food. This is exactly what I did once on a 2 day hike. 

If you are looking at two piece rods because of their more compact size, you may also want to consider telescoping rods. I've had (3) telescoping rods & all but the Amazon-special-carbon-fiber job have served me well (the no-name brand amazon one broke into many pieces...), but I've loved the Mako Calypso 8' rod & my much smaller Shakespeare telescoper as well. With these rods too, some people will try to argue that they lack sensitivity, but I've felt the hits on these & landed anything from trout, perch, & crappie to a stripper off an ocean pier. Personally, I started experimenting with telescoping rods so I could more easily take them with me while backpacking & biking. Now, they are all I have! I have used two piece & one piece rods in the past, but that was so long ago I don't think I'd have any practical advice on what is out there now. I'd only note that as @That Idiot noted, multi piece rods do have a tendency to fly apart while casting or fighting a fish IF you don't check the connection between casts. (Note that this doesn't happen with telescoping rods).
