You need to isolate this noise to identify the cause. Its great that you can duplicate the noise without having to ride. Try these suggestions to help narrow down the cause. 

So other than drilling the bare minimum diameter holes in the frame, what else do I need to consider? 

The real bear comes in trying to undo BB cups, especially if they've been on for a while. Or you have weird left/right threads and not sure which way to turn it. The right tools help hugely here. The only thing I can think of in the way would be a chainguard. They generally have to be completely unscrewed/bolted to access the chainrings. 

Basic troubleshooting steps 1) Is there power coming from the dynohub? Use a multimeter on AC 6V (possibly 20Volt setting required on a standard meter) 2) Is the power capable of flowing to the lamps? Use a meter on continuity-beep or on resistance setting to check. 3) Does the lamp fitting carry power to the lamp? Same as #2 4) Does the lamp work? Use continuity or resistance test again. Replacing the wire is a good idea if it looks manky, and new lamp holders will give you more light for the same input. The hub is the most expensive part. 

The word "c'mon" is a bad choice for an alert word, because you close your mouth to form the M and the C is a back-of-mouth sound that you can't say loudly. The N sound is a nasal sound, so the volume there is through your nose. So the only loud part of this word is "---OOOOOnnn" If your alert phrase was "Come on!" then it would be better than "c'mon", but the word of volume is some variation on HEY or HOI or OI 

1.37 x 24T is the big threadings, its 1.37 inches across and 24 threads per inch (so you need to turn it 24 times to advance it 1 inch) Also check Saint Sheldon's info at $URL$ Based on that I guess you want a 3NN bottom bracket cartridge, but do use a ruler/calipers to confirm all the dimensions. Your other option is to clean and take the old spindle/axle into a nice LBS and ask for assistance. They're generally good at that kind of thing. 

set the bike so the chain is on the second-smallest cog. Then click the right-hand shifter so it would move to the highest gear/smallest cog if you pedal, but don't pedal. Use a ring spanner or similar to release the pinch bolt clamping the cable in the rear derailler mech. Pull the inner cable snug, making sure all the outers are seated in the frame bosses. Mind out for fly strands in the inner cable, they pierce skin easily. With the cable snug but not moving the rear derailleur, tighten the pinch bolt onto the wire. Minor tweaking from there can be done using the barrel adjuster which is on the rear of the rear derailleur where outer cable housing loops around. 

METHOD Write up your marking criteria before seeing any entries. That will help you not be swayed by bikes you like personally. SCORE Allocate 100 points per entrant, with say 10 for finish, 10 for rideability/functionality, 10 for originality etc. Leave yourself 10 points for wow-factor, and 10 points for whatever you didn't expect. That will help you be more objective, repeatable, and be able to defend your scores. SHARE If there's a bunch of bikes, consider doing it as a tag team with someone else. Discussing the display will help show things you might not notice straight away by yourself. TIME Use a timer - allocate the same amount of time to judging each bike... no less than 2 minutes and no more than 3 for example, will take you between 3 hours 20 min and 5 hours to judge 100 bikes. You want judging done by early afternoon so people can see the ribbons/awards. So start judging from 0900. AWARDS Have shiny ribbons and certificates for the winners to take home and keep. If there are cups they tend to be returned after 10 months for the next year's winner. 

Nope - go for it. Here are two suggested routes from Strava, which were generated at $URL$ and then clicking a start and end point, and changing some options. This first one is based on "most popular with cyclists" and runs for 30 km with total elevation change of 204 metres. 

Further information at $URL$ I think the spring reproduces some of the trail that would otherwise be absent. 

Speed is generally not an issue - I've topped 40 km/h solo on my tandem, and the previous owner exceeded 70 km/h on it on a race, with two riders. 

Instead you want to try the reach adjust, and try tweaking the caliper mounting bolts so the caliper is aligned how you want it. 

Buy yourself a set of new brake pads. They come with all the washers and nuts. When the current pads wear out, move all the washers and bolts to the newer pads, which you keep safe till you need them. Or just fit new pads now. 

I did half of this - my late 80s 3x5 speed freewheel with nuts got upgraded to a 3x7 freehub with quick release, because the wheel was available. Turned out the freehub was actually 8 speed, so I could have gone as high as 3x8. However its already hard to get the wheel into the frame - I don't think you'll fit a wheel and an 11 speed cassette in there. Also the QR has to be checked after every ride. I've had the back wheel rotate slightly in the dropouts and it rubs on the chainstay, which means it moves at the power stroke. I did not cold-set the frame, so the dropouts are not parallel they are now slightly which allows a little movement and eventually the QR comes loose enough to move. Depending on conditions this might be 10 to 100 km of riding to back off loose. The rear thumb shifter will need to change, that's a given. I got away with using the same rear deraileuer mechanism and wire, but had to change the lever to a 7 speed indexed one. You'll also need to change the chain. 5 speed chains are quite thick and may bind up in a 6/7/8 cassette. Mine cost $50 for a cassette, $3 for some spacers, $40 for the thumb shifter, and another $40 for the new 6/7/8 speed chain. That was probably too much, but the freehub and chain needed doing anyway. Summary this is probably not worth doing unless you get the replacement parts really cheap (ie free or almost free.) 

The Stem Cap is alloy and it had white aluminium oxide "rust" , so the same treatment has left a different look. I left the four offset stem bolts chromed and unpainted, because in my experience painting nuts and bolts is a waste of time. 

Alright this bag was measured for another bike so its a bit saggy here. The pump hook gets in the way, and the downtube is much smaller and a different angle from the designed bike. Flaws - the zip is the wrong way around, and should close forward so cables can come out easier. Velcro is all wrong for this bike. I also use a top-tube bag for more storage when on a long ride. That holds snacks and my phone running on another USB battery (because its annoying when strava stops recording.) 

Two tricks for baulky pumps. 1) You can get a bit more air in by going hard on the pump at the end. Try for at least 3 full strokes per second, faster if you can. A minipump is easier than a long pump. 2) Go slower - Work on a steady stroke, but at the end do a quick hard ram to seat the plunger. This will force the pressurised air through the valve in the tyre. You might want to look at servicing your pump, which means lubricating the plunger seal, or replacing the o ring if its worn or torn. 

I'm going out on a limb but if you only maintained your internally-geared hub just once, three years ago, then its probably excessively worn due to poor maintenance. Also the oil is likely carrying metal flakes which are doing continuous damage to the gears. IGH are low maintenance but not zero-maintenance. An oil change right now might be enough to bring it back but excessive wear will likely have shortened its overall life. Depending on wear, you might benefit from a new 1/8" chain and new cog too. If you can't or won't do maintenance yourself, then simply book it into the local bike shop for work annually and pay for someone else to do it. 

I have an old RSX hub on my road bike - when servicing the bearings, the cones were found to be horribly pitted. So I tool the old cones into an LBS and asked for replacements. They whipped out vernier calipers and measured, and found some suitable ones. One was $21 and the other was $4 NZD. To move the dust cap over, I simply used the right size of socket and a bench vise to press the dust cover off. Same method worked fine to put cap on the new cone and did not damage the race at all. 

ANSWER: You cannot run a 50 tooth cog with that derailleur. You might be able to use a hanger extension, but that will make the small gears even worse. Wolf's Roadlink allows up to 40 tooth, and Wolf's Tanpan says 44 or 45 tooth is the maximum cassette size supported. Note these are for 10 and 11 speed. If you're absolutely stuck on a 50 tooth rear cog, then you're looking at a SRAM 12 speed Eagle setup, which will not be cheap. Cassette and shifter must change, and its very likely your freehub won't fit the cassette, and then the OLD will be too large to fit in your frame. Not a good plan. 

We don't do specific product recommendations. However I got a cheap $25 ANT+ HRM off DX.com and it has work superlatively for the last 6 months, on the original battery. I got a cheap cadence meter off a local supplier and its been nothing but rubbish. Chews through a battery in a day or two, and is very hard to find. I'm glad it was on clearance at $20 down from $80, cos I wouldn't have been happy with its performance at $80. Many modern android phones have ANT+ built in. No Apple product has ANT+ - they all depend on BLE Bluetooth Low Energy. IMO Cheaper items win out because of their replaceability. Expensive ones smash just like cheap ones, why waste the money on pricey sensors? This advice doesn't apply to power meters- I don't own one and cannot comment. There are no "cheap" power meters. 

For the sake of consistency, I'd do the same thing on both sides of the wheel, but even if they were opposite I doubt you could notice a difference. 

Visually you can see there's more clear space through the higher-grade cassette. Shimano claims an 11% increase of the void space in the back of the cassette between these two versions. 

The purpose of this is to hold the correct too in place while you apply leverage. Also means your fingers are nowhere near the pinchy bits. When working alone you can now use hand leverage, and then a progressively increasing series of hammer taps to work the cup loose. NOTE the drive side cup is left-hand threadded. So turn it the opposite way If you're talking about the cup on the non-drive side, then its often a different fitting, with a lock ring. You can either do exactly as illustrated, but use a park HCW-11. Or you can use a pair of stiltsons or some sliding lock-jaw pliers on the locking ring part. 

The threads are not opposites, so that hose won't go into a schrader chuck. Compare the end with these adapters - see how the brassy one looks like another schrader valve, and the topeak one looks larger? 

Doubtless there will be the few oddballs with a metric thread as well, but they'll be really uncommon.
