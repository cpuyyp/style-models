The bottom line about assistance exercises are that they can be ANYTHING you want as long as they help you reach your goals. So don't think too hard on these, get some good volume in, but don't kill yourself. Here is a google doc spreadsheet that already has all of the formulas and weekly work outs in place. So once you've read the above article you can use this to start plugging in your numbers. START LIGHT and start with the empty bar if you have to.

BCAAs are found in whole foods such as cottage cheese but the volume isn't up there like it is in a BCAA blend nor are they as readily bioavailable since the BCAAs in typical blends are free floating. Like many others I don't consider whey protein powder to really be a supplement since it's technically a dairy byproduct, however, you can supplement WITH IT out of convenience. If you choose to supplement with protein powder I would take no more than 0.8g/lb a day(and you don't even have to worry about hitting that max). Also, if you supplement with whey protein powder you do NOT need to supplement with BCAAs since most whey powders contain the same amino acid blends. Nutrition: This is a tough one. I can't recommend any specific diet but since your goal is to get significantly leaner without packing on much weight, I would recommend that you plan out your daily caloric intake to be 500 less than your calculated TDEE(total daily energy expenditure). To cut to such a relatively low body fat percentage you'll need to accurately count your calories and weigh foods. Don't get caught up on fad diets, just watch your macros and don't go too overboard. Carbs are not your enemy. You will need to be sure to readjust this using updated TDEE values as you gain weight from the newb muscle gains you'll get from starting a strength training program. The key to any diet is moderation and diversity. Don't let yourself get caught up on the organic vs processed paradigm as studies show that GMOs(genetically modified organisms) are not anymore harmful that natural ones. You won't be doing yourself any favors by following any severely restricted diets and studies show that dietary restrictions often lead to behavioral regressions after fitness goals are achieved. Alan Aragon suggests that you adjust your caloric intake to favor more solid foods versus liquid ones(solid calories vs liquid calories has a lot to do with the quality of calories, the satiety, and the tendency/relative ease to overdrink calories). Just keep this in mind but don't take it too too seriously. You do not need to plan your meals around particular timing patterns. Plenty of research indicates that meal timing is a hugely irrelevant factor as far as metabolic efficiency is concerned and has no real bearing on it. This is actually a GOOD thing because it means that you can make your meal timings accomodate YOUR schedule. If you find that eating 5 times a day at specific times works the best for you then that's what you should do as long as you keep it in line with your caloric intake requirements, but, just keep in mind that there's no scientific or health benefit to doing such. 

I'm aware of what the report says but was advised to post the question. I am also interested in the responses more so that I can figure out how to proceed with my own gains. One of the main draws I had to SL 5x5 was the 45 minute workout time, but now since things are getting a little tough, the rest time between heavy(relatively)sets is really drawing out the length of the workout to 1.5 hours easily. I was just advised recently by Dave Liepmann that this was normal and he also said that he changes the programming when this occurs. I'm wondering if it's "time" to switch to SL 3x5 even though my lifts aren't THAT high? For reference: 

My question is really general and doesn't pertain to any one specific individual but seeing the question about the Bizzy diet on here makes me question. Its workout plans instructs individuals to perform high intensity interval training to 'melt the fat'. But, can HIIT even be performed effectively by people who haven't practiced any cardio at all in a long time? Say a couch potato who has only lifted weights and never actually run? Situations like that. 

I need some solid input from you guys. My friend let me try his Inzer lever belt, it's a size medium, here's the thing though, the medium measurements for the lever belt are 30 to 33. When I used the inzer belt, I was basically 1 hole from the tighest setting, if you've used the lever belt it has the plate on the back side that you adjust when you cut/bulk. This setting pinched me a bit more than I liked but I felt like the amount of support I had was perfect. I ordered a single prong inzer belt, sized medium, because I prefer the prong over the lever. But here's where I made the mistake and just want you guys to confirm or give thoughts. The single prong medium is measured for 33 to 35. I got my single prong medium today and honestly, it cucked me. I'm like literally one hole away from where I feel like the belt would give me the support I'm looking for but I cannot get it in. So the next hole down I just don't have the abdominal pressure I want compared to the inzer. So I'm thinking damn, it all makes sense now, after looking at the measurements. The inzer lever belt for me felt the best on nearly the tightest setting, that means the belt for me probably fit in the 30 to 32 range since the 33 would be too big, considering the lowest range of the medium prong is 33 inches, and it's just 1 hole away from probably being a good fit. The small prong is 28 to 32 inches, so I have the top end of the fit on that belt to fit in the 30 to 32 inch fit on the lever belt. So obviously, I should've gone with the small prong belt to begin with, right? Or am I just retarded and the pronged belts don't give as much support as the lever belt? I still have at least 3 more holes on the medium belt before it's completely tight. Would I even benefit from a smaller size? 

I think that having at least calculated a few of your baseline TDEE values can be beneficial if you're overweight and have gotten your body "used" to under consuming calories based on something like say, willpower for example. Body weight x 24 is an absurd amount, for me that means my body would require roughly 4200 calories for maintenance. My actual calculated TDEE is ~2536. Just google TDEE calculator and you'll find the ones that are based off scientific values and even ones that let you adjust based on activity level. The best way to reduce weight without sustaining metabolic damage is to reduce your calories by 500 of your TDEE and then readjusting your TDEE for weight lost. If you go into a severe deficit you'll lose weight for a short amount of time and then plateau. A lot of the times when someone can't lose weight even through intense exercise they're either eating too much(e.g. surpassing their caloric maintenance) or just plain not eating enough(eating enough to reach their calculated TDEE MINUS the caloric deficit). 

In the StrongLifts report there's a section where the author discusses being able to easily run and jog with moderate endurance if you can squat heavy weight such as 300lb. But I don't buy it. I am sure he is not the only one to have purported this but I'm curious as to if there's any truth to it, given a subject who has never trained in any type of running, and if there's not how people simply believe it. 

Good morning, I am an avid lurker here and I try to answers that I feel confidently knowledgeable about to answer but after much reading between answers to my own questions, other questions, and comments, I am more unsure than ever of how I should proceed. Let me put my goal into focus: to lose fat weight. Right now I am not interested really in strength training even though I've been doing stronglifts. I guess the biggest thing I'm skeptical or unsure about is what ACTIVITY I should be doing(cardio? HIIT cardio?)to most effectively lose fat weight. I love the relative efficiency of StrongLifts but as I said I am a skeptic of what it claims. The biggest ones are "gain muscle while burning fat", "your body will be forced to pack on muscle to squat 300lb" , "more strength = more muscle". I'm not going to lie; the latter two claims sound like total broscience and yes I know that SL 5x5 is a sort of derivative of other 5x5s like Starting Strength. I have hit a 250lb PR squat doing it, but, at weight this heavy, my lifts seem to stall and plateau all over the place even though I have deloaded and plateaued. To me, it doesn't scientifically make sense that one could actually gain strength on SL 5x5 that isn't just a vast amount of "newb gains" since you technically don't actually pack on weight, whether it's muscle or fat, unless you eat over maintenance. So if you're not eating over maintenance how can you reasonably sustain any kind of strength gaining progression? I feel like my diet is what has really hindered my progress on SL 5x5, since, to be totally honest I just don't eat that much. But now that I recognize that my primary goal right now is to lose fat weight, is a restricted diet with a strength training program even really the most efficient way to go if I'm not even really setting myself up to gain that strength? I understand the principals of intensity and volume but just don't feel like they apply the same to individuals who actually are primarily concerned with losing fat weight if you take into consideration the actual science behind weight gain and weight loss. One of my other issues is my diet I believe. My TDEE is calculated to be 2439 calories/day, which if you take off 20% makes it 1952. I eat below 1952 every day but don't see any weight loss and I think it's because my body is used to what I eat. I consume around 1500 calories a day if I'm lucky. I tend to only eat when I'm hungry and I don't really load up much on junk food. But I'm still quite chunky. So this + the fact that my gains on SL continuously stall and plateau makes me wonder if I should be switching to HIIT cardio to reduce fat weight. What do you guys think? edit: I do appreciate both answers so far and they make sense but I guess I'm just looking for something more grounded as maybe an acceptable method. I keep googling and googling and googling things like "stronglifts fat loss" and "5/3/1 fat loss" and keep seeing posts from guys who say: "No offense man but aiming for strength while losing fat is just going to be an exercise in futility in both areas" or "If you're going to cut, then cut, if you're going to bulk, bulk" or "trying to add strength while cutting sounds like a bad idea to me". So I just don't know what really to do. The reason I'm so focused on finding something more grounded is because I keep reading that you need the intensity. Well I can't get stronger if I'm mostly attempting to cut which undermines the intensity. So does that mean I should cut and focus on HIIT cardio 5xWeek and then bulk up?
