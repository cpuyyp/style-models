I'll use cohomology with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}/2$ everywhere. Suppose that the space $P=\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$ embeds in $S^{n}$ (where $n>2$). Recall that $$ H^*(P)=(\mathbb{Z}/2)[x]/x^{n} = (\mathbb{Z}/2)\{1,x,\dotsc,x^{n-1}\} $$ By examining the top end of the long exact sequence of the pair $(S^{n},P)$ we find that $H^{n}(S^{n},P)$ has rank two. Lefschetz duality says that this group is isomorphic to $H_0(S^{n}\setminus P)$, so we see that $S^{n}\setminus P$ has two connected components. (I don't need any orientation conditions here as I am working mod 2.) Let $A$ and $B$ be the closures of these components, so $A\cap B=P$ and $A\cup B=S^{2n}$. Lefschetz duality also gives $H^{n}(A)\times H^{n}(B)=H^{n}(S^{n}\setminus P)=H_0(S^{n},P)=0$. We now have a Mayer-Vietoris sequence relating the cohomology groups of $A$, $B$, $P$ and $S^{n}$. As $H^1(S^{n})=H^2(S^{n})=0$ this gives an isomorphism $H^1(A)\times H^1(B)\to H^1(P)=\{0,x\}$. After exchanging $A$ and $B$ if necessary, we can assume that $H^1(B)=0$ and that there is an element $a\in H^1(A)$ that maps to $x$ in $H^1(P)$. It follows that $a^{n-1}$ maps to $x^{n-1}$, which generates $H^{n-1}(P)$, so the Mayer-Vietoris connecting map $H^{n-1}(P)\to H^{n}(S^{n})=\mathbb{Z}/2$ must be zero. This contradicts exactness at the next stage, because $H^{n}(A)\times H^{n}(B)=0$. 

I'll assume that you mean the Borel cohomology $H^*(EG\times_GM)$. If so, the answer is $$ \mathbb{Z}[\![c_1,\dotsc,c_n]\!]\otimes\Lambda^*(a_1,\dotsc,a_n), $$ where $|c_k|=2k$ and $|a_k|=2k-1$. To see this, first note that you can replace everything by maximal compact subgroups without changing the homotopy type. This means that the relevant space is $EU(n)\times_{U(n)}U(n)^{\text{ad}}$, where $U(n)^{\text{ad}}$ refers to the space $U(n)$ with $U(n)$ acting on it by conjugation. This can be described in a different way as follows. For any complex vector bundle $V$ (with Hermitian inner product) over a space $X$, we can consider the fibre bundle $U(V)$ whose points are pairs $(x,g)$, where $x\in X$ and $g$ is a unitary automorphism of $V_x$. If we take $V$ to be the tautological bundle over $BU(n)$ then $U(V)$ is easily identified with $EU(n)\times_{U(n)}U(n)^{\text{ad}}$. For any $V$ and $X$ it is known that $$ H^*(U(V)) = H^*(X) \otimes\Lambda^*(a_1,\dotsc,a_n), $$ and my claim above is a special case of this. The key ingredient in the proof is Miller's stable splitiing theorem for $U(n)$, in the equivariant form proved by Nitu Kitchloo; some additional details are in my paper "Common subbundles and intersections of divisors". 

Here is a little background, partly taken from some notes of Dietmar Vogt: $URL$ When $M=S^1$ we can just take $f_{2k+1}(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))=\cos(k\theta)$ and $f_{2k}(\cos(\theta),\sin(\theta))=\sin(k\theta)$. This gives an isomorphism $S\to C^\infty(S^1)$, and of course we can precompose this with any of the many automorphisms of $S$, so $C^\infty(S^1)$ has many different bases. If $(f_j)$ is a basis for $C^\infty(M)$ and $(g_k)$ is a basis for $C^\infty(N)$ then the functions $h_{jk}(x,y)=f_j(x)g_k(y)$, enumerated in a suitable order, will give a basis for $C^\infty(M\times N)$. If $V$ is any nuclear Frechet space, then a theorem of Komura and Komura shows that $V$ is isomorphic to a subspace of $S^{\mathbb{N}}$. I do not understand all the issues here, but it seems like there is not too much difference between $S$, $S^{\mathbb{N}}$ and subspaces of $S^{\mathbb{N}}$. It is certainly known that $C^\infty(M)$ is always a Frechet space. Vogt's notes show that when $U$ is a nonempty open subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$, the space $C^\infty(U)$ is isomorphic to $S^{\mathbb{N}}$. If we choose $U$ to be a tubular neighbourhood of an embedded copy of $M$, then $M$ will be a retract of $U$ and so $C^\infty(M)$ will be isomorphic to a summand in $C^\infty(U)$, and thus to a summand in $S^{\mathbb{N}}$. 

Put $A_p=\mathbb{Z}/p$ and $B_p=\prod_{q\neq p}A_q$ so $G=A_p\times B_p$. Multiplication by $p$ acts as zero on $A_p$ and as an automorphism on $B_p$ so $pG=0\times B_p$ and $G/pG\simeq A_p$. Put $U_p=\text{Aut}(A_p)=(\mathbb{Z}/p)^\times$. There is an evident homomorphism $\phi:\prod_pU_p\to\text{Aut}(G)$. Any automorphism $\alpha\in\text{Aut}(G)$ induces an automorphism $\alpha_p\in\text{Aut}(G/pG)=\text{Aut}(A_p)=U_p$. In more detail, the projection $\pi_p:G\to A_p$ is surjective, and $\ker(\pi_p)=0\times B_p=pG$, which implies that $\alpha(\ker(\pi_p))\leq\ker(\pi_p)$. From this it follows that there is a unique homomorphism $\alpha_p:A_p\to A_p$ with $\alpha_p\pi_p=\pi_p\alpha$, or in other words $\alpha(g)_p=\alpha_p(g_p)$ for all $g\in G$. We thus have a map $\psi:\text{Aut}(G)\to\prod_pU_p$ sending $\alpha$ to $(\alpha_p)_{p\in\text{Primes}}$. If $\psi(\alpha)=1$ then for all $g\in G$ we have $\alpha(g)_p=\alpha_p(g_p)=g_p$ for all $p$, which means that $\alpha(g)=g$; this means that $\psi$ is injective. Given this, it is not hard to check that $\phi$ and $\psi$ are inverse to each other. Thus, $\text{Aut}(G)$ is the same as $\text{Aut}(t(G))$. 

First, for any bundle $V$ of dimension $d$ over $Y$ put $$ \lambda(V)(t) = \sum (-1)^k[\Lambda^k(V)]t^{d-k} \in K^0(Y)[t]. $$ This is a monic polynomial of degree $d$ over $K^0(Y)$. It satisfies $\lambda(L)(t)=t-[L]$ if $L$ is a line bundle, and $\lambda(A\oplus B)(t)=\lambda(A)(t)\lambda(B)(t)$. Thus, if $L$ is isomorphic to a subbundle of $V$ then $V\simeq L\oplus W$ for some $W$ and we find that $\lambda(V)([L])=0$. Let $p\colon \mathbb{P}(E)\to X$ be the obvious projection. For any $U\subseteq X$, put \begin{align*} A^*(U) &= K^*(U)[t]/\lambda(E|_U)(t) \\ B^*(U) &= K^*(p^{-1}(U)) \end{align*} The bundle $H$ over $\mathbb{P}(E)$ is tautologically a subbundle of $p^*E$, and using this we obtain a ring map $A^*(X)\to B^*(X)$ sending $t$ to $[H]$. Essentially the same construction gives maps $\phi_U\colon A^*(U)\to B^*(U)$ for all $U$. Recall also that $\lambda(E)(t)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $d$. It follows that the set $T=\{1,t,\dotsc,t^{d-1}\}$ is a basis for $A^*(U)$ over $K^0(U)$. Now suppose we have open subsets $U$ and $V$. There is a Mayer-Vietoris sequence relating the $K^*$ groups of $U$, $V$, $U\cup V$ and $U\cap V$. Using the basis $T$, we obtain a long exact sequence relating the $A^*$ groups of $U$, $V$, $U\cup V$ and $U\cap V$. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for $p^{-1}(U)$ and $p^{-1}(V)$ gives another long exact sequence relating the $B^*$ groups of $U$, $V$, $U\cup V$ and $U\cap V$. The maps $\phi$ link these two long exact sequences. They are obviously compatible with ther restriction maps $A^*(U)\to A^*(U\cap V)$ and so on, but a little work is needed to check that they are also compatible with the connecting morphisms. Now put $\mathcal{U}=\{U\;|\;\phi_U \text{ is iso } \}$. If $U$ is contractible then $E|_U\simeq U\times\mathbb{C}^d$ and the standard calculation of $K^*(\mathbb{C}P^{d-1})$ shows that $U\in\mathcal{U}$. If $U$, $V$ and $U\cap V$ lie in $\mathcal{U}$ then the Mayer-Vietoris sequences together with the five lemma show that $U\cup V\in\mathcal{U}$. Now suppose that $X$ can be covered by open sets $U_1,\dotsc,U_n$ such that all intersections $U_{i_1}\cap\dotsb\cap U_{i_r}$ are empty or contractible. Then one can check by induction on $n$ that $\phi_X$ is iso. If $X$ is a finite simplicial complex then the open stars of vertices provide a cover of the required type, so $\phi_X$ is iso. The case of a completely general $X$ follows by homotopy invariance and a limit argument. 

Suppose instead that the rank is two. This means that any maximal torus in $G$ is also a maximal torus in $SU(V)$, so $G$ is a parabolic subgroup. Suppose that $V$ is reducible as a representation of $G$. This implies that there is a one-dimensional subspace $L\leq V$ that is preserved by $G$, and thus that $G$ is contained in the image of the homomorphism $\phi:U(L^\perp)\to SU(V)$ given by $$ \phi(g)=g\oplus(\det(g)^{-1}.1_L) $$ As $G$ is connected and nonabelian of rank two, I think it has to be the whole image of $\phi$. Suppose instead that $V$ is irreducible. I think it then follows from the standard story about parabolic subgroups that $G$ is all of $SU(V)$. 

Suppose for simplicity that $M$ is connected and orientable. Choose a point $x\in M\setminus A$, and a closed disc $U$ centred at $x$. We can use the chart to deform $i$ into a homotopic map $j$ such that $j(A)\subseteq M\setminus\text{int}(U)$. Collapsing the complement of $U$ gives a map $p$ from $M$ to the one-point compactification $U\cup\{\infty\}$, which is homeomorphic to $S^n$. It is standard that the resulting map $p^*\colon\mathbb{Z}=\widetilde{H}^n(S^n)\to H^n(M)$ is an isomorphism, but $pj$ is constant, so the map $i^*p^*=j^*p^*=(pj)^*$ is zero, so $i^*$ is not an isomorphism. 

Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $K$ be a finite field whose characteristic does not divide $|G|$. I am interested in the theory of finitely generated modules over $K[G]$. Of course many problems are not present here because $K[G]$ is semisimple and all modules are projective. My case is partly covered by Section 15.5 of Serre's book "Linear Representations of Finite Groups". However, Serre likes to assume that $K$ is "sufficiently large", meaning that it has a primitive $m$'th root of unity, where $m$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the elements of $G$. I do not want to assume this, so some Galois theory of finite extensions of $K$ will come into play. I do not think that anything desperately complicated happens, but it would be convenient if I could refer to the literature rather than having to write it out myself. Is there a good source for this? [UPDATED]: In particular, I would like to be able to control the dimensions over $K$ of the simple $K[G]$-modules. As pointed out in Alex Bartel's answer, these need not divide the order of $G$. I am willing to assume that $G$ is a $p$-group for some prime $p\neq\text{char}(K)$. [UPDATED AGAIN]: OK, here is a sharper question. Put $m=|K|$ (which is a power of a prime different from $p$) and let $t$ be the order of $m$ in $(\mathbb{Z}/p)^\times$. Let $L$ be a finite extension of $K$, let $G$ be a finite abelian $p$-group, and let $\rho:G\to L^\times$ be a homomorphism that does not factor through the unit group of any proper subfield containing $K$. Then $\rho$ makes $L$ into an irreducible $K$-linear representation of $G$, and every irreducible arises in this way. If I've got this straight, we see that the possible degrees of nontrivial irreducible $K$-linear representations of abelian $p$-groups are the numbers $tp^k$ for $k\geq 0$. I ask: if we let $G$ be a nonabelian $p$-group, does the set of possible degrees get any bigger? 

Let $P$ be any partially ordered set. For any map $x\colon P\to [0,1]$, put $\sigma(x)=\{p\in P:x(p)>0\}$. Then $BP$ can be identified with the set of maps $x$ such that $\sigma(x)$ is finite and totally ordered, and $\sum_px(p)=1$. Now suppose that $a$ is an element of $P$ which is comparable with every other element, and define $e\colon P\to [0,1]$ by $e(a)=1$ and $e(p)=0$ for $p\neq a$. It is then easy to see that the map $h_t(x)=(1-t)x+te$ preserves $BP$ and gives a contraction. This construction is most often used when $a$ is largest or smallest in $P$, but you really only need it to be comparable with every element of $P$. In particular, if $P$ is nonempty and totally ordered then you can choose $a$ arbitrarily. As another way to look at this, if $f,g\colon P\to Q$ are two poset maps, and $f(p)\leq g(p)$ for all $p$, then it is standard that $Bf$ is homotopic to $Bg$. If $P$ is totally ordered, we can define $f,g,h\colon P\to P$ by $f(p)=p$ and $g(p)=\max(a,p)$ and $h(p)=a$. Then $f\leq g\geq h$, so $Bf$, $Bg$ and $Bh$ are homotopic, but $Bf$ is the identity and $Bh$ is constant. 

There are some potentially useful formulae in Section 7 of this document: $URL$ I have not seen them in the literature, though I may not have looked in the right place. They are directly applicable to complex Grassmannians, but it may be possible to adapt them. 

Suppose we make a graph $G$ as in Moritz's answer. The number of edges is then $a_n=\sum_{p < n \text{ prime }}(p-1)/2$, which is asymptotic to $n^2/(2\log(n))$ by the prime number theorem. Now put $b_n=\lfloor n\log(n)\rfloor$, which is much smaller than $a_n$ when $n$ is large. It is a theorem of Pósa (see $URL$ for example) that a random graph with $b_n$ edges almost surely has a Hamiltonian cycle. (More precisely, if we let $g_n$ denote the number of graphs on $\{1,\dotsc,n\}$ with $b_n$ edges, and let $h_n$ denote the number that have a Hamiltonian cycle, then $h_n/g_n\to 1$ as $n\to\infty$.) This remains true even if we replace $b_n$ by $\lfloor cn\log(n)\rfloor$ for some $c>0$. As $a_n\gg b_n$ for large $n$, and there do not seem to be any very small counterexamples, it seems quite likely that there is a Hamiltonian cycle for all even $n$.
