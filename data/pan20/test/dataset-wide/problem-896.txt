All of this has me a little curious as to the thought processes of Defoe and company (although I'll stick to Defoe, for simplicity). Was Defoe aware that he was using a new sort of realist techniques, and was this usage intentional? Put another way, are the indicators of formal realism in Robinson Crusoe part of an effort by Defoe, or just elements of the writing that were noticed long after the fact? 

We can consider Tennyson less than enamored with such an idea, and indeed, other works of his dealt with real revolutions in other countries that he felt could threaten Britain. My fellow students, professor and I chose to interpret The Kraken in the political context, within the larger collection of Tennyson’s works. The Kraken itself may represent the working masses and their dreams of freedom, growing steadily larger under the elite upper-classes. Their revolutionary ideas of social change are in an “ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep”, as they always are during periods of political stability. However, their discontent, stuck in the depths of their minds and hearts, has grown bigger and bigger, until it is a monstrosity. Eventually, Tennyson feels, this will all burst. The Kraken - the masses - will rise as ”the latter fire” of revolution begins, throwing the country and perhaps the world into turmoil. The death of the creature is also symbolic. It could be an indication of Tennyson hoping that any resulting chaos will be short-lived or will fizzle out, or that another “cycle” of peace (to quote Sypher) will begin. Anyway, this is simply one interpretation of the poem, a consideration of Tennyson’s views on social and political change as a whole. I hope I’ve convinced anyone reading this that Tennyson did have varying thoughts on revolution and its implications, and that this may well be the underlying meaning of The Kraken. While it can be argued that the poem is an explanation of religion or of our deepest feelings, or that it should simply be taken literally, I think that the idea of sudden political change is also an equally valid stance. 

He also wrote more stories after LOTR, in addition to a couple (non-fiction) research papers before that. So he wasn't entirely new to writing in general. 

So it's not really a retirement, it's more of a temporary break. And the last quote implies that stars prefer to be in the sky versus on the ground, because Coriakin was punished with coming down. For those who don't remember, the duffers were the (for a time) invisible and one-legged creatures. Coriakin was supposed to be guiding them. Finally, it's also unknown what punishment merits a star coming down. 

The poem appears to glorify war with its talk of bravery and talk of honouring the light brigade. However, the second to last stanza appears to contradict this: 

Here is also a list of place names and their equivalents, taken from the book linked above: (warning - really long) Wessex - Name - Region of Wessex Actual Name 

The Scarlet Letter, Chapter II As time passes, the letter changes in meaning. Some people "refused to interpret the scarlet A by its original signification". The A comes to mean "able" in their minds. (Chapter XII) Eventually, the letter becomes somewhat sacred: 

Presumably, this means that either Holmes is not aware of Moriarty, or Moriarty has not yet come to prominence (alternatively, it could just be that Doyle had not planned out Moriarty yet, which is the likely out-of-universe explanation). Keep in mind, too, that Holmes has had multiple encounters with all of these characters. He is well aware of their movements and their plots, and at times regards them all as the worst - mini-Moriartys, so to speak.1 I guess my points are these: 

This seems somewhat ironic, insofar as Aurora is the one to reject Romney's advances, whereas Boyd appears to have inadvertently rejected Barrett Browning's advances. It begs the question of whether this reversal is a reflection on that courtship, and whether Barrett Browning agrees or disagrees with how it ended. 

A review by William O'Donnell says that Frost is "unequalled" by any British or American poets in the 19th century in his use of blank verse. In the early 20th century, such a structure was rejected by Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, although Frost continued writing the same way. Iambic pentameter, of course, permeates Frost's work. However, it is an odd, even informal variant. A contemporary analysis of Frost notes that "The Runaway", while using the meter, is irregular even in the first few lines: 

The poem both honors their bravery, but notes that their bravery got them killed. To quote this article, "Tennyson's soldiers are bold, heroic, glorious, honourable, noble and dead." 

Hyperion and Endymion are poems by the famous poet John Keats, both based on Greek mythology. Hyperion talks about the Titan's despairing after their defeat by the Olympians, and was written in 1818-1819. Endymion is based on the myth of Endymion, where the moon goddess Selene falls in love with him, a king and son of Zeus. Are these poems supposed to be related to each other? They both cover Greek mythology, which prompted my question. 

Rose doesn't recognize him, and when questioned about how to leave (to get to the Keep of Time), he abruptly tells them to try the trump again, and walks away. However, before they leave, he tells Rose: 

In 1984, O'Brien expects Winston to know what Room 101 is. I know that Room 101 is more torture, but why would O'Brien expect Winston to know that? 

It's unknown, but it appears that although The Epic of Gilgamesh was written first, the Pentateuch (part of the Bible containing the creation stories) has the first description of the flood story. From the Idaho University page on The Epic of Gilgamesh: 

We don't know for sure, but he may have known the river. Blair originally submitted a list of four possible pseudonyms to his agent, Leonard Moore, telling Moore that he could make pick of the four1: 

The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton depicts Holmes' and Watson's encounter with Charles Augustus Milverton, a man who is, according to Holmes, "the worst man in London" (he even drives Holmes to burglary!). Given the criminals whom Holmes has had dealings with, this is not a title he bestows lightly, and so it seems likely that either the detective and the blackmailer have met before, or that Holmes has worked on a case involving Milverton. Is there anything to suggest that Holmes, before being hired to deal with Milverton, had previously encountered him? If so, what were the circumstances? 

1. Professor Moriarty I'd like to go into Moriarty in more detail, because Worth was not the only inspiration for Moriarty. Doyle did not simply draw on Worth for inspiration. Masters of Crime states that Doyle himself only acknowledged being inspired by one criminal: Jonathan Wild, a 17th and 18th century master of the criminal underworld. In The Valley of Fear, he is even referenced by Holmes: 

The Scarlet Letter, Chapter XIII In short, the letter started as a badge of sin, but due to Hester's actions later it became something, if not to be proud of, not to be ashamed of. 

It's well known that Silverberg wrote novels based on some of Asimov's stories. For example, The Child of Time was based off of The Ugly Little Boy, and Nightfall was based off the Asimov story of the same name. How many other (if any) novels/books/other works did Silverberg base off of Asimov stories? 

(I don't remember the main character's name) The book opened with the main character (an old man) living on a mostly abandoned world. I don't remember the exact setting, but it was barren of sapient life. There were animals that were like a cross between a racoon, komodo dragon, and velociraptor. They were sentient and hostile to humans, but the main character had somehow tamed them so they didn't attack him. A woman visits the man, asking for his help with something. I'm fairly certain it's not explicitly stated in the story yet, but the man understands what she wants. He refuses. It turns out there are two rival factions warring for control of pretty much everything, and he doesn't want to participate in the war. Furthermore, he doesn't trust the woman to be who she claims to be (she says she's from faction A, but she might be from B) At some point in here another man appears, heavily injured and unconscious. I don't remember much about this, except I'm fairly certain the woman kills the unconscious man. The story culminates with the reveal of the a piece of technology. This is some sort of wristband that allows the wearer to warp between parallel Earths. The old man's version of the device was older and in the form of a belt. There was an asteroid. In different versions of the Earths, the asteroid went from overshooting it on the right, to hitting the edge, to full-on collision, then hitting the left edge, to missing, etc. The old man was living on a planet where the asteroid had come close enough to obliterate life, but not actually hit and destroy the planet. The woman turned out to be evil (shocker amirite) and stole something (I think) from the old man. He chased her, and she kept running and warping from world to world. At some point they even warped to a place where the asteroid had completely destroyed the planet and there wasn't even an atmosphere. At the end, it turns out the old man was the creator of this technology. He couldn't live in a world with that tech being constantly used, so he left to live like a hermit on an Earth far away. He had created the device, and another person had refined it into a lightweight wrist device. He spared the woman and told her to leave, but she still tried to kill him. She failed, and I'm fairly certain the old man just left her for the komodo-racoon-raptor beasts to kill. He packed up camp and left for a more distant world, possibly using up the rest of his device's battery. At the end, the leader of the pack of the komodoraptors was implied to have gained human-like intelligence, implying that it would start a dog-eat-dog style civilization. Lastly, I'm fairly certain the reason the old man didn't like the technology was because he thought it would lead (spoiler: it did) to humanity exterminating other versions of humanity and pretty much any other animals they came across, cutting off their future and preventing them from evolving further. The ending possibly implied that he realized what the komodo lizards would become, but maybe not. I'm fairly certain I read this story in a collection of short stories from assorted authors, again in the US about 6 months to a year ago. 

As with the horse, there is no evidence to suggest that these farmyard creatures have sentience. This might be indicative of a pattern. There were also various monsters in certain books: 

For comparison, this falls around the time of one of Doyle's earliest works, The Sign of the Four, set in 1888. Now, at the end of the first part, Watson asks readers to "journey back some twenty years in time" for the second part of the story, which takes place in 1874 and 1875. Clearly, the first part can't take place in 1895 because Moriarty was dead by then - The Final Problem takes place in 1891. So if we assume that "twenty years" is an approximation, we can place The Valley of Fear at 1888 or 1889. I would place the story at 1889, given that it's a better approximation, but Watson appears to be living with Holmes at the time. In the epilogue, they receive a letter: 

You don't need to read them in any order. Overall advice The interesting thing about The Hardy Boys is that the writing style has changed over time. I don't know just how many ghostwriters have been used since their beginning in 1927, but it's got to be quite a few (Wikipedia suggests it's more than a dozen, often collaborating). Combine that with the fact that America itself has changed, and you see that the overall dynamics of the pair and of the plots are far from regular. Nowadays, some of their books have them fighting terrorists. That would not have been happening 60 years ago. There have been several subdivisions of all the books that have been written. My argument is that most divisions, from a pure reading point of view, are superficial compared with the overall trends. You don't have to worry about reading, say, the entirety of Undercover Brothers to move on to the next period. My advice: 

Not really private islands, and they don't really retire either. When a star is old enough and has lost enough power, it can go to one of the islands on the Eastern Ocean. While there, it recovers its strength and becomes young again by eating "fire-berries". 

There are no recurring characters, except in the sequels and spin-offs. For example, as you noted with "except for the sequels", there are recurring villains such as Slappy the dummy. However, in the spin-off series of Goosebumps HorrorLand, there are recurring places/enemies (such as the park itself). But in the plain Goosebumps series, no. 

The scarlet letter has many meanings in the context of the story. In the beginning, it represented a sin and crime committed. As the story (and Hester) move on though, it becomes a symbol to be proud of (at least in Hester's mind): 

The only occurrence of "church" in the book is in the preface, "From the Publisher to the Reader". This is also fictional but not really part of the events of the book. 

I was re-reading The Silver Chair recently, the 6th book in the Narnia series. Towards the end of the novel, 

The Guardians are a group similar to the Cahills and Vespers, their job is to guard the pieces of the doomsday device. According to the 39 Clues wiki page, they protect the pieces of the Doomsday Device and they move them from place to place until they find the right place to hide it. The only known living guardian is Atticus, though his half-brother Jake may also be one. As to the locations of the pieces of the doomsday device being unknown, it's possible if not likely that they were known before all of the other were killed/died. 

The colonel originally told Miss Emily that he was doing this as a favor to her deceased father, whom he said had given the town a loan some time ago. While Miss Emily believed this, several others evidently saw through it, although they said nothing to her. Emily Grierson had hit financial troubles, so to speak, and so essentially getting rid of her taxes was a way for the colonel to help her keep going without losing her pride. It's written that Miss Emily would never have accepted a charitable donation. I'd bet that this stems from the fact that the Griersons were a proud and reputable family. They might have once been members of the powerful Southern aristocracy, and Miss Emily likely still had plenty of heirlooms and reminders of that time. The family was described later on - somewhat sarcastically - "the high and mighty Griersons". Therefore, Miss Emily would have viewed it would an insult to have to stoop so low as to accept financial help from others. The colonel likely intended this as a gentlemen's agreement - informal, not legally binding, but bound by a gentlemanly moral code of the time. The story goes on to say that those who followed him had "more modern ideas", which evidently did not include such agreements. Therefore, they attempted to undo the remission, which, of course, led to Miss Emily's refusal to pay her taxes. We see this inter-generational discord arise in another way, when only a young alderman thinks they should be direct to Miss Emily about the smell emanating from her house. 

There isn't a direct relationship, but here's a map drawn by Bertam Windle based on his correspondence with Hardy: 

TL;DR of this answer: There are definitely gender stereotypes here, of a more violent male passage vs a gentle female one. However, it's also a different resolution of the narrative. You can think of it as saying "gentleness will lead to a better end", but again it's unclear if this is what the author intended. It's also highly likely it was just a publicity stunt. Heck, if you even asked this question it sorta worked. Who knows, maybe the author intended people to read stuff into it that he didn't write. 

Yes. The poem was written in response to seeing his cousin, Lady Wilmot Horton, at a ball. She is his cousin by marriage, through a man named John Wilmot, governor of Ceylon.. 

No. She was just Amy's mother, nothing special. She had a habit of going out and coming back with men, having a one-night-stand with them. One night, a college frat boy tried to take her where she didn't want to go, and she killed him. After this, she dropped Amy at the convent, telling Lacey (who answered the door) that she was going to be right back.
