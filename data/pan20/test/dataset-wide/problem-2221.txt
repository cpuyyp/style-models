Some teams do insure certain contracts, however many contracts are too risky for any insurance writer to issue a policy (A great example is Amare Stoudamire's contract with the Knicks). The issue that necessitates player insurance in the first place is the idea of guaranteed contracts. These are contracts that require the team to pay out the entire value (or some major percentage) of the contract no matter the status of the player. If the player is hurt or is cut by the team they must pay all of the guaranteed money to the player. However different leagues have different types of contracts and different levels of guarantees based on (At least in the US) how their collective bargaining agreements are structured. These are the agreements that allow the leagues to exist and play games in the US. In the four major sports here are how contracts work: 

Most of the current T20 leagues around the world are very new and the playing rosters are typically not settled; players change teams a lot between seasons. In addition, many players play in a lot of these leagues, often for only brief periods such as a few games at the start and end of the season only due to international commitments. In these cases, what determines the eligibility to play for a team in the CLT20? Is there a minimum number of games or is playing just 1 game enough? What if a player was contracted to a team, but didn't actually play any games due to injury or form? Maybe there are no rules at all, and the franchise can bring any players they can managed to hire along to play the CLT20, even if they have never played for that team before? If a player played for a team in a previous season, but not the one in which the team qualified for the CLT20, can they play? 

This chart shows that most often the winner was in the 7th position. However I would not take the results as conclusive one way or the other. But I would say that there is not a strong correlation between draft position and overall results in a fantasy league. 

However, this is exceptionally rare in high level baseball as I cannot conceive of a situation where a runner would move backwards on a ground ball. An MLB runner will be 10-30ft from the bag when contact with the ball is made. He will then determined the kind of contact, if it's a ground ball he's going to run as fast as he can to the next base, if it's a liner he will freeze and if it's a popup or flyball then he will use his judgement to determine if a fielder has a play (go back to the bag and tag up) or does not have a play (advance quickly to the next base and beyond). 

In non limited overs cricket (i.e. 5 day test match cricket or 4 day 'First class' cricket), there are almost no restrictions on where fielders can be positioned, the only restriction being a limit of two players behind square on the leg side. You will sometimes see situations in which every fielder, apart from the wicket keeper, is on the boundary. This is sometimes known as a 'ring field'. Typically you would see this if a top order batter is batting with a tail-ender. The bowling team wants to stop the batter scoring boundaries, but are happy for them to score a single bringing the tail-ender on strike who they have a better chance of getting out. The inner circle was introduced in limited overs cricket in order to stop the bowling team setting these kinds of very defensive fields for long periods, which makes the game boring. Without any restrictions, the fielding team could set all the players back to stop boundaries which makes for boring cricket. For instance, see this description about what used to be possible in one day cricket before fielding restrictions were introduced. The way the inner circle works is that a certain number of players (the exact number differs between 50 over and 20 over cricket) must be within that circle. This means that there will always be some gaps on the boundary that the batter can target with attacking shots. In powerplays, the number of fielders that must be in the inner circle is increased, meaning even more gaps in the outfield giving the batter the incentive to hit the ball in the air over the top of the infield into the gaps, or even to try and hit a 6 knowing that if they miss hit it there are less outfielders who might be able to catch it. 

So team A will send their players who weren't the right mix for team B to team C, and team C will send their players to team B, who will send the closer to team A. A recently revealed potential scenario actually has some interesting details and insights into this. The author there gets into the details, but it amounts to this: 

College rankings sort of matter. NFL power rankings don't at all. There are a number of factors here, but let's examine what the two are, so we can make sure we know how apples to oranges this comparison really is. Collegiate Rankings: These are official polls done by major new organizations. The two major polls are the AP poll and the USA Today poll. In the AP poll members of the media rank their top 25 teams. In the USA Today poll, NCAA I-A coaches vote for their top 25 teams. These lists are compiled, and posted on major sports websites. Until this year, these polls were factored into the computer rankings that determined which two teams would compete for the national championship. This year, four teams will be selected to compete, and these polls may or may not factor into the decision making process. Power Rankings: Anyone can put together a power rankings. Generally the major ones are a single, or small set of journalists ranking the best teams. ESPN, SI, YSports and many other organizations put out their own Power Rankings. These rankings have absolutely no importance whatsoever to determining league championships. 

Try dusting the inside of the shoes (or outsides of your feet) with chalk (or talcum powder) before using them to soak up some of the sweat, which can then we wiped out with a slightly damp cloth. There are various commercial products you can get to soak up shoe smell while shoes are being stored (not climbing shoe specific). These are usually in the form of an inner sole with some kind of absorbent material inside. You could probably achieve a similar result using bi-carb soda. Try putting a few tablespoons full inside a small cotton bag and insert into the show while not in use. The bag should let air in (so the bi-carb can soak up the smell) while stopping the bi-carb from getting into your shoe. 

So suffice to say, if there is a runner on, it's almost always better to pinch hit in this circumstance. No matter who pitches the 7/8/9 the odds are good you are going to need another run to keep pace and two to win. So it's a good idea to pinch hit for your pitcher if you even have a chance to score. 

Generally when you buy a large number of baseball cards you're going to get a ton of common and uncommon cards. Obviously you want rare or special cards to be kept separate and be well maintained, but the bulk of your collection is going to be common cards. I'm planning to start collecting again soon and would like to have a good idea of what kind of storage I should plan on obtaining for the bulk of my collection. What storage solutions exist that make these cards easy to access, keep them in fair condition and do not take up too much space? I'm especially interested in solutions that readily expand to take on more cards. 

The ratings system used by the ICC to rate countries is a modified (simplified) form of the Elo rating systems. The basic idea behind these type of systems is that 

If all balls are fair there will be 6 balls in the over. If one batter faces all of these and gets the maximum score possible each ball, which is 6 runs for hitting the ball on the full over the boundary, then they will score 36 runs in the over. 

A deliberate knock on is a penalty as opposed to an accidental knock on that results in a scrum. In the case of a defender batting down a pass, the referee has to judge whether they think the defender was actually trying to catch (intercept) the pass or just trying to knock it down to prevent the pass from being completed. The later is a penalty, you have to be trying to catch and control the ball. As for the yellow card, if this occurred near the defenders try line, or if there was a good chance of a try being scored had the pass been completed (i.e. was going to a winger with no more defenders on the outside) then this constitutes what is sometimes called a 'professional foul'. This is grounds for a yellow card. Essentially if the referee thinks a player deliberately incurs a penalty in order to illegally stop a play that has a good chance of leading to a try a yellow card should be given. This is more typically given for infringements in the ruck, such as lying over the ball to prevent the attacking team from retrieving it, but other circumstances such as the one you describe also fit the description of a professional foul. The terminology of 'cynical' I haven't heard before, but it is referring to the same concept. 

The answer to this question is Kaz Matsui in 2004 for the New York Mets with 125 hits. The next best are Tommy Harper of the Seattle Pilots with 126 in 1969, Deon Sanders of the Reds in 1997 with 127. And finally rounding out the top 5 are Lou Whitaker and Luis Polonia For the 89 Tigers and 90 Angels respectively with 128 each. My analysis determines that it's fairly common for a team to have a leader with fewer than one hit per game. It's happened over 250 times since the 162 game schedule was adopted in 1962 (with 4 strike shortened seasons thrown out). Which is an average of about five teams per year. My research also indicates that the all time low water mark is: Bill O'Rourke of the 1878 Boston Red Stockings with 71 hits over the 60 games that comprised that league year. I've confirmed this to be the case, there are several players from other leagues (Union Association and American Association) that have fewer hits, but it seems their teams played many many fewer games than were scheduled (my baseball history is not strong enough to know why without more research).
