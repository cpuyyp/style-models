This appears to be one of Sergii Tsololo's more convincing efforts in the synthetic "space" image genre. It is listed on various stock photo sites as "Blue and purple space galaxy," or with added 4-way spikes, "Blue space starfield with flares." A real astrophoto would identify the subject and not be tagged "abstract" or "fantasy." To check it another way, I submitted the image to Astrometry.net, whose plate solver failed to match the field within their 10 minute time limit. When I submitted an amateur photo of the Trifid Nebula as a control, Astrometry.net found a solution in less than 1 second. 

Surface brightness of galaxies and nebulae is typically expressed as visual magnitude per square arcsecond. Skyglow is often quantified in the same way. Given the angular dimensions of the frame and the magnitudes of a few stars in it, photometry software could compute sky brightness by excluding all visible stars and dividing the total brightness of the remainder by its angular area. Here is an online tool to convert between $\mathrm{mag} / \mathrm{arcsec}^2$ and $\mathrm{cd} / \mathrm{m}^2$. 

It was posted on November 26, 2002, with the caption "Name This Martian Robot." There was an essay contest to name the two Mars Exploration Rovers to be launched in 2003. The winner was Sofi Collis, a third grader in Arizona. 

Earth is a special case since the equatorial and ecliptic coordinate systems are defined in terms of its own rotation and orbit. Earth's north pole vector in equatorial coordinates is $$\vec N_{\oplus,eq} = (0, 0, 1)$$ To transform this to ecliptic coordinates, we rotate about the $x$ axis by the obliquity $\varepsilon$ = 23.44$^\circ$ and get $$\vec N_{\oplus,ecl} = (0, \sin \varepsilon, \cos \varepsilon) = (0, 0.3978, 0.9175)$$ In a spherical coordinate system, two angles define a unique direction. In equatorial coordinates these are the right ascension $\alpha$ and declination $\delta$. This IAU report, table 1, gives $\alpha$ and $\delta$ values for each major planet's north pole as of 2000-01-01 and formulas to compute them for other years. To convert these to rectangular form $$(x_{eq}, y_{eq}, z_{eq}) = (\cos \alpha \cos \delta, \sin \alpha \cos \delta, \sin \delta)$$ Then if you want J2000 ecliptic coordinates $$(x_{ecl}, y_{ecl}, z_{ecl}) = (x_{eq}, y_{eq} \cos \varepsilon + z_{eq} \sin \varepsilon, z_{eq} \cos \varepsilon - y_{eq} \sin \varepsilon)$$ But if you want another planet's orbital plane to be the $xy$-plane, then you also need the orbit's inclination and longitude of ascending node; I leave that transformation as an exercise for the motivated reader. 

Reda and Andreas 2008 equation 28 comes from Jean Meeus, Astronomical Algorithms, equation 12.4. He derived it from Aoki et al. 1982 equation 13, which IAU used from 1984 through 2002. Let's break it down: 

From a heliocentric point of view (U, V, W) = (8.5 - YY, XX, ZZ). Then $\tan{l} = V / U$ and $\tan{b} = W / \sqrt{U^2 + V^2}$ as you'd expect. 

To transform an equatorial $(x, y, z)$ into a galactic $(x_G, y_G, z_G)$, the Gaia data release 1 documentation, section 3.1.7, uses $$ \begin{bmatrix} x_G \\ y_G \\ z_G\end{bmatrix} = \mathbf{A}'_G \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{bmatrix} $$ where $$ \mathbf{A}'_G = \begin{bmatrix} {−0.054876} ~ {−0.873437} ~ {−0.483835} \\ {+0.494109} ~ {−0.444830} ~ {+0.746982} \\ {−0.867666} ~ {−0.198076} ~ {+0.455984} \end{bmatrix} $$ is composed of three coordinate frame rotations $$ \mathbf{A}'_G = \mathbf{R}_Z(-l_\Omega) ~ \mathbf{R}_X(90^\circ - \delta_G) ~ \mathbf{R}_Z(\alpha_G + 90^\circ) $$ with the north galactic pole at equatorial coordinates $(\alpha_G = 192.859^\circ, \delta_G = +27.128^\circ)$ and the galactic equator crossing the celestial equator at galactic longitude $l_\Omega = 32.932^\circ$. This is equivalent to the transformation defined in the Hipparcos catalogue, volume 1, section 1.5.3. Murray 1989 and Liu 2011 give similar matrices whose elements differ after 6 decimal places, which matters only if you require sub-arcsecond precision. 

The Milky Way consists of numerous faint stars near our galactic equator. Many of these are visible in binoculars. As time lapse videos show, they move across the sky along with the bright stars. The light and dark patches in those digital images are easier to see visually near the galactic center in Sagittarius than in the opposite direction near Orion. Due to its oblique angle, the galactic equator appears to go through a special cycle as everything revolves around the celestial pole. From mid-northern terrestrial latitudes, it runs overhead NW-SE when Orion is highest, low in the north when Virgo and the Big Dipper are highest, and overhead NE-SW when Cygnus is highest. We see no more than half of this cycle on any given night, which may explain the illusion you perceived. 

Yes, if you observe Earth and the Moon at a favorable time. Near a Saturn summer solstice, e.g. between 2012 and 2022, Earth appears well above the horizon from Saturn's north pole. If the planet body is out of the way, so are the rings. The other observability issue is Earth's elongation from the Sun. This reaches a maximum of about 6$^\circ$ at intervals of about 189 days, e.g. late September 2018 or early April 2019. Even then, you would need to shade your optics from the Sun and be above Saturn's atmosphere. 

For an astronomical object, a 1000 mm focal length objective forms an image 1000 mm away. However, the image of a terrestrial object focuses farther out: 1010 mm for a target 100 m away, 1020 mm for a target 50 m away. When switching from a terrestrial target to an astronomical one, the eyepiece must move closer in. Aligning the finder on a terrestrial target is bound to produce some parallax error. After focusing the telescope on a bright planet or the Moon, aim the telescope at Polaris and fine-tune the finder. Finally, even with good finder alignment, sometimes you will have to sweep to locate your target. It gets easier with practice. 

Casertano et al. used the period-luminosity (P-L) relation of Cepheid variables as a sanity check on Gaia DR1 parallaxes. They chose Cepheid variables within the Milky Way having parallaxes in TGAS (Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution, reusing Hipparcos data for a head start). The period and apparent magnitude come from ground-based photometry (van Leeuwen et al. 2007, section 2 and appendix A). The Cepheid period-luminosity relation gives an absolute magnitude, leading to a distance estimate whose reciprocal is an expected parallax. The actual parallaxes agree with the photometric estimates. Having found the Gaia DR1 parallaxes sane, they used those parallaxes to make a tentative estimate of the Hubble constant $H_0$, which in turn serves as a sanity check on a recent $H_0$ estimate based on various HST observations (Riess et al. 2016, cited as R16). Later they hope to combine HST photometry of Milky Way Cepheids with final Gaia parallaxes for an improved $H_0$ estimate. 

Cosmologists estimate the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years. The most distant objects we could theoretically observe emitted light that long ago; light from more distant objects hasn't reached us yet. Due to expansion of the universe, that horizon is now about 46 billion light-years away. If we assume uniform expansion in all directions, we can approximate the observable universe as a sphere of that radius, consistent with the diameter you'd heard. I figure its volume as roughly $4 \times 10^{32}$ cubic light-years. The shape and size of the unobservable universe are anyone's guess. 

Depending on the root cause, vibration damping pads may or may not help. Some telescope vendors sell sets of three for $50 or so; an Internet search also yields a few do-it-yourself recipes using silicone caulk, sorbothane insoles, etc. Other home remedies are possible, such as adding weight or shims to the mount, or hanging a chain from the optical tube assembly.
