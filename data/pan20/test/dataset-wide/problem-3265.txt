High-ranking women taking up arms as commanders was not uncommon in Northern Europe duing the late medieval period. Often, they were required to step in when their husband died, but they could also be appointed to lead if he had to be somewhere else. During the bombardment of Copenhagen in 1428, Queen Philippa, married to Eric of Pomerania and daughter of King Henry IV of England, led the defense and rallied the citizens of the city. In the upheavals that marked the end of the Kalmar union, Stockholm was besieged several times. In 1501-1502, Christina of Saxony, wife of King Hans of Denmark, was left to lead the defenses against forces under former Swedish regent Sten Sture the older, while Hans sailed for Denmark. During the siege, the defenders were reduced from about 1000 to just 70, before they surrendered. A few years later, the wife of the Swedish regent, Sten Sture the younger, Christina Gyllenstierna, led the defenders of Stockholm against Christian II of Denmark, when her husband had been killed in earlier fighting. At the same time, Sweden's second most important castle at Kalmar, was defended by Anna Bielke (whose mother Gunilla Bese had for some time held command of Vyborg Castle). After Christina had surrendered, Christian instigated the Stockholm bloodbath. 

While investigating on Albania, I kept finding peoples I never heard of before. Notwithstanding my vast ignorance, this was systematic to the point that I started investigating. Take a look at this map: it does not even reproduce all of the ethnic groups. The overabundance is so evident that this question is asked elsewhere on the internet (with no answer, spare that click for later). This website has a comprehensive list of ethnicity, but offers no answers. I was impressed reading: 

Premise: I do not have Buxton's book, so my objections are based on other sources. The origin of this claim are to be traced in a series of references. These include: 

If we instead strictly limit ourselves to documents thought as written documents only, I would like to cite: 

What evidence support either version? I am particularly interested about the French version, as I have some vague idea of the English one. 

(The two last claimed that they were sons of Magnus after his death). I also found two cases of four brothers: First, we have the sons of Harald Gille from the list above: 

Perhaps Napoleon's marshal Michel Ney? He was first one of the marshals that forced Napoleon's abdication, and was promoted when Louis XVIII was put on the throne. During the Hundred days, he promised to bring Napoleon back in a cage, raised a force, but defected to Napoleon at first chance and commanded the army that fought Wellington at Quatre Bras and the left flank at Waterloo. After the defeat of Napoleon, Ney was executed. Granted, this was more of treachery on the personal level, but I think it fits the intent of the question. 

I'm going to base the following of an essay by Frans G Bengtsson, "Marskalkarna av Frankrike", found in Sällskap för en eremit. The essay in turn was written after he had read Gabriel d'Orgeval's Le Maréchalat de France and, particularly the part I will take my material from, G.A. Macdonell's Napoleon and his Marshals. I'll be using the word "hate" a lot as a catch-all since it is hard to tell from a short account exactly how strong the dislike actually was. I'll also cover dislikes between all the Marshal's, for the benefit of anyone finding this question in the future. Onward to the actual answer: The Marshals seems to have rather disliked each other as a general rule: 

I have recently written an answer to the question you have linked. There I explain in detail how, alongside preexisting polytheistic religions, the Arabic Peninsula was largely monopolized by Judaism and Christianity by the 5th century. The structure of religious belief was then not different from that of other countries of the time. By the 6th century, Mecca was emerging as the most important centre in the peninsula. It became known as the Holy City, and there were Sacred Months during which the Arabs from every corner would gather there. Already before the advent of Islam, the Kaaba was a temple. It was believed that Abraham had built it, and pilgrims would circumambulate it much like modern Muslims. Before the prevalence of monotheism, the land was divided between a mostly nomadic north and a sedentary South. The latter was a pragmatic society, that did not leave many writings concerning religion and philosophy. In fact, we do not know very much about the structure of ancient religons, when compared with the Greek one, so your comparison is somewhat unfair. Source: The Cambridge History of Islam 

First, not all world championships is every fourth year: Ice hockey is every year, athletics every second. However, I could not find any event held every third or every fifth year, so this does not really break the basic four-year pattern (Badminton seems to have used a three-year schedule for a while, but is now on a four-year one). This supports the theory of a general connection with the olympic schedule. In many cases, also, it seems like the olympic games were for many sports considered as the world championships. This is the case of e.g. football ("soccer", if you're from the US), athletics and ice hockey. While this obviously, did not guarantee that it would continue to be held every fourth year, it did establish a basic pattern. Also, one should consider that one can probably not have events more dispersed than four years: for most sports, a four-year schedule means there will only be two or three world championships during the best years of a career. A five-year schedule would reduce this further. Together with the wish to avoid two large events the same year, this would mean cycles of two or four years. For some sports, it appears that reducing the value of every fourth world championship is a bearable cost, so theycan have events every year. 

The ancient Seleucia was founded along the Tigris river around the year 305 BC, and abandoned in 165 AD, due to the river mutating its course (Wikipedia). However in 780 AD the Catholicos (=Patriarch) of Seleucia was the most important Christian authority, overseeing over a quarter of the world's Christians [2]. This fact alone suggests that the city was far from an abandoned site, and rather thriving. Some sources refer to Middle Ages Seleucia as Seleucia-Ctesiphon. So let's assume that the Catholicos was based in Ctesiphon; the destruction of Ctesiphon was perpetrated by the invading Arabs, who later founded Baghdad. However Again there is an inconsistency, as the Arabs burned Ctesiphon (or Seleucia-Ctesiphon) in the VII century, and founded Baghdad one hundred years later. Where were the Catholicoi(?) based meanwhile? All this is in disagreement with the most common view that Seleucia was abandoned because of Roman attacks and replaced by Ctesiphon in the II century. The neighboring Ctesiphon, was in turn abandoned in the VII century after the Arab invasion, while Baghdad was founded in the VIII century. Everything appears like a giant naming mismatch.

Denmark and Norway had plenty. Denmark had six bastard kings in a row, five of which were fathered by Sweyn II: 

While not exactly records of actual events, stranded whales where important enough to the early Icelanders that they regulated them in their laws. Grágas states that you are even allowed to work to secure a stranded whale on Sundays. Stranded whales are also recorded in sagas, such as Grettir's saga, which, among other things, records a feud over a stranded whale. While the sagas can not be taken as straight history (Grettir also encounters ghasts and witches), they can provide valuable insight into mentality and everyday happenings. 

Probably more common than you would think. Lots of nobles were little more than farmers with a coat of arms. Peasants could acquire a lot of wealth. Were the division between the two classes fell varied enourmously between countries, as well as the relative status. To give an example: In Sweden, the noble class was created in 1280, when anyone who would equip and keep a war horse in the service fo the King was declared to be exempt from other taxes. Thus, the entire nobility was created straight from the peasantry, so there difference between "peasant" and "noble" was not a matter of blood, but rather one of exactly how much money you had. Marrying someone slightly less rich than you would not be a great deal. Note that even if you want to restrict "nobility" to having some sort of conferred title, the only ones that really existed in Sweden were "duke" (almost exclusive for royals) and "knight", and a person like Bo Jonsson (Grip), who controlled two thirds of the country, never attained either (and he was, BTW, married to the daughter of a knight). 

After the defeat of the French fleet off the coast of Egypt in 1798, Napoleon's army was cut off in a far away and hostile country. One year later, after eluding the British fleet, he made it safely to France. Some argue that he bought some British commanders, while others discount this hypothesis and acknowledge a mix of luck and courage on Napoleon's behalf. In order to judge the likelihood of different scenarios, it seems to me that we must know what level of surveillance he had to elude in his sail. So, what countermeasures did the British - and their allies - employ to prevent Napoleon from leaving the Middle East? 

We know how several (hundreds?) migrations brought people from Central and East Asia towards Europe and the Middle East. Most of these people established their own rule over some land, but it seems to me that invaders either survived to date as an ethnic and/or cultural majority (Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria, ...) or disappeared as a group - leaving genetic and/or cultural heritage to different degrees (Huns, Lombards, Vikings, ...). However, when we look at the ethnic map of Europe, there is considerable less fragmentation than in the Caucasus only, especially if one considers the difference in overall extension and population, and that Europe itself contains a fair amount of impervious regions (Alps, Pyrenees, ...) The question: why so many groups survived (at least culturally) in the Caucasus compared to nearby regions? I'm interested both in geographical reasons and in historical developments (e.g. national states vs empires, political fragmentation vs centralization, ...). 

The most obvious example would be the Siege of Kaffa, in which the Golden Horde tried to take control of what was then a Genoese colony, situated on Crimea. However, the Black Death spread in the mongol army, and they had to abandon the siege. Before they left, they hurled dead corpses into the city, in the hope that the plague would spread. It eventually did, and from there to the rest of Europe. Here is a blog post discussing the more medical aspects, which also cites a primary source in some length. 

One example is the Battle of Bogesund, a part of the internal conflicts of the Kalmar Union, which led to then Swedish regent Sten Sture the younger being mortally wounded after a cannonball had bounced on the ice, and ultimately allowed Kristian II of Denmark to seize the Swedish throne. Other battles has taken place on Storsjön, Bysjön, and Viken. There is also a mythological batttle on Vänern. For a really history-changing event (even if was not an actual battle) which was made possible due to winter conditions, there is the March across the Belts, during which king Charlex X of Sweden managed to cross into the Danish island Sjaelland and threaten Copenhagen. The peace that followed transferred large parts of present Sweden from Denmark-Norway. 

Another source [8], also discusses this legend, and the earliest recorded occurence is again in Firdausi. However the author speculates about the earlier development of the theme. According to al-Masudi's early history of India, shatranj, or chess 

I take your question as "just before the advent of Muhammad." Therefore I will not delve into ancient history, and limit the answer to late-antiquity and early Middle Ages. First of all we have to note that people in the Arabic Peninsula could (and can) be divided geographically between the (mostly) arid North (notwithstanding oases and narrow coastal regions) and the prosperous South, with its Sabaean-Yemenite people. The South was dominated by sedentary kingdoms, and was the Arabia Felix of Roman sources, thanks to prosperous trade and local production of spices. This land became object of a struggle between Jewish and Christan preachers, with alternate phases. Judaism penetrated in the Arabian Peninsula as earlier, and became a crucial region after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. Christianity arrived later, but its universalism demanded conversion of the local people. The apex of Judaism was reached with the conversion of the King Dhu Nuwas and the subsequent massacre of Christians of Najraan. Immediately afterwards, with the approval of Byzantium, an expedition of Ethiopians, who were Christians, conquered the Kingdom and brought its independence to an end. Judaism however survived until the advent of Islam. The other areas of Arabia were instead populated by a complex marriage of sedentary people and nomadic Bedouins. The latter did not leave written records, but we know that the Arabic Hijaz was divided by the Christian zone of influence to the North (centred around Najraan) and the Jewish one to the South (gravitating Yathrib). These areas met in Mecca, which was to become the most important centre in the region, following the fall of the Sabaean South to the Ethiopians and the stalemate in the North between the Sasanid and Byzantine Empires. The religion in Mecca was complex. Reportedly, at the time of the Quraysh domination, besides Christianity and Judaism a triad of goddesses was venerated: al-Laat, al-Uzzaa and Manaat. These were daughter of Allaah, which was interpreted as either the God of the Bible or another Semitic deity. In these days, Arabia became haeresium ferax, a cradle of heresy. The importance of Judaism/Christianity was evident in that the people of Mecca, and Arabs in general, considered themselves descendents of Abraham and Ismail, which are Biblical characters. In the Sacred Months, the Arabs from far and wide would flock to the Holy City of Mecca and its Haram, the sacred precinct, and the Kaaba. They would gather for the Ukaaz, a fair which was also a scene of poetic contests, and climb the Holy Mountain of Arafaat for the pilgrimage. In the sixth century, a new concept of Arabia Sacra was emerging, alongside with the rise of the Arabs, finally aware of being a nation. Muhammad was born in AD 570 circa.

The regions marked as Swedish holdings were given to Sweden as part of the treaty of Westphalia, following the Thirty years war. They were not fully incorporated in the Swedish state. This meant that they had their own laws and diet, but were under a Swedish governor (this can perhaps be compared to how the Channel Islands today are not parts of the United Kingdom). Sweden also had rights of representation in the imperial diet as well as relevant Kreis diets. The Swedish King's relationship with the Emperor of the HRE was complex: while technically a vassal, this did not really matter that much, since the title of Emperor at this point had lost most of it's power, even if the Emperor still held a lot of power as the head of the house of Habsburg. Also important was that Sweden together with France had rights to guarantee that the Westphalian peace would be upheld, which gave some right of interference in general HRE politics (Charles XII made use of this in 1707 in order to restore the rights of protestants in Silesia: in the end, the emperor acceded, but that had more to do with the military treat of the Swedish army than legal matters).
