So basically once the batsmen complete the first run (which is the only run required to win) then the match ends. If the ball goes to the boundary then that won't count, and therefore the batsman will only be credited 1 run not 4. However if the ball goes to the boundary before they complete the first run then 4 runs will be given to the batsman (and the team score also), since once it reaches the boundary the match ends. 

As can be seen that the 1992 world cup was 4 years 3 months after the 1987 world cup. In Australia and NZ the best cricket weather is after the new year, so that is probablty why it appeared as 1992 and not late 1991. Exactly 4 years later Sri Lanka held the world cup in 1996. If this was readjusted, again leaving only 3 years for them to host, which could have been too short EDIT ADDED: Thinking a bit more Sri Lanka's turn was correctly set at 1996 since it was held in February possibly for the same reasons as it was held in 1992 for Australia and NZ. They could have chosen October/November 1995 (as was the 1987 World Cup in India/Pakistan) but perhaps the weather was better in February 1996. Of course in western Europe mid year is the best time so May/June 1999 was logically the next time it would be held. The 2003, 2011, 2015 World cups were in February but were correct and not offset by a year. The "heads up" of when these cups would start would give these hosts time to prepare and separate itself from the dates of the ICC Champions Trophies END EDIT Perhaps the change was down, not to the 1999 world cup, but the 1992 world cup. They probably wanted it to be 1991 but that would have meant February 1991 and not late 1991, which could have had issues with both NZ and Australia having enough time to get ready for the world cup. This was the first world cup that featured colored clothing and day-night matches. They probably always wanted to get back on the orginal 4 year pattern laid out by the original first 4 world cups. and in fact they kinda did with those 2 being only 2 months into the following year. Other possible factors Another consideration was how close the ICC Trophy was to the World cup. It started out every 2 years, but later changed to every 4 years, ideally not the same year as the World cup: wikipedia link 

Besides from their signature shoes, player jerseys are some of the most popular merchandise bought by fans. My question is, do players earn from the sales of replicas of their jerseys? 

The Olympics, in general, only requires an athlete to be a citizen of their country for them to be eligible to compete under their flag. The Olympic charter states the following: 

Players are often seen challenging out calls/non-calls by the linesmen, but when the chair umpire makes a call correction, can a player still challenge the corrected call? 

Fastest laps are classified as the fastest time set around a particular race track during a Grand Prix, however, due to the new fuel rules in F1 that banned mid-race refueling, some of the fastest laps are hard to break, even though the cars set qualifying times that are faster than these set times. Take the Japanese GP at Suzuka for example, the recorded fastest lap around the circuit was a 1'31.540 by Kimi Raikkonen in 2005, but a faster 1'30.915 lap was done during qualifying by Mark Webber in 2013. A more recent qualifying vs race time comparison was during this year's Monaco GP. Daniel Ricciardo got pole on a 1'13.622 while the recognized fastest lap was a 1'17.939 by Lewis Hamilton. Why are Fastest Laps taken from the fastest race lap and not from the significantly quicker qualifying times? 

Which means throwing the ball down at the wicket (which is much harder than the grass) could damage the ball. The umpire may warn the player (and captain) of such behaviour according to this rule. 

Note that the Rugby world cup and Commonwealth games features almost the same nations as the cricket world cup. As you can see the "even" years are pretty jam packed so making it the "odd" makes sense, though they are the same years as the cricket world cup which could make planning harder so they don't happen at the same time. Remember, all these tournaments take a lot of money to host and the TV rights, sponsor money and getting the people in are all important. Having the lesser sport of cricket not competing with the likes of the Summer Olympics would work in their favour. 

Aside from Charlie Whiting, the FIA Race Director, the race stewards who look at and deliberate on on-track incidents are apparently not the same every weekend. There have been races where I hear the Sky F1 commentators mention a few familiar names as part of the stewarding team, former F1 drivers like Emanuele Pirro and Nigel Mansell. Looking around the internet, the FIA website has published biographies for known race stewards of certain race events, but they all come from different backgrounds in the motorsport industry, some of them former FIA officials and some racing drivers. (see source) Is there any specific criteria for selecting race stewards? Does being a former F1 driver qualify you to be one? And did these people volunteer or are they a part of a collection of people that are assigned to be race stewards every race weekend? 

So with all the above, LBW is considered at the point of first strike of the body without the bat. If that is not LBW, he is only given out if he swipes at the ball to prevent the ball touching the wicket with his hand unless it is to avoid injury. Using the bat to prevent the ball striking the wickets after the shot has been played (and already made contact with either the body or bat) is considered not out. If any other part of the body including and it is deliberate then it should be out. I have seen this happen in matches and have not seen anyone given out 

So, regardless if it hits the side or back wall, the ball can only bounce at most once to keep the rally going. The rules only mention the requirement of hitting the front wall above the tin. the ball can strike any other wall at anytime provided the ball only has at most bounced once. 

Is there a record of who has had the worst first serve percentage during a singles match in a grand slam event? This question includes both men's and women's games. 

A similar case happened during the 1982 season, where five drivers (Didier Pironi, John Watson, Alain Prost, Niki Lauda, Rene Arnoux) shared the most number of wins with two wins each, while the eventual champion (Keke Rosberg) only had one. The circumstances behind the championship were quite bizarre, though, as Pironi suffered a career-ending accident during the German GP, five races before the end of the season. Before then, he was leading the championship comfortably. Compared to the multiple retirements and non-scoring finishes shared between the multiple race-winners, a consistent points haul throughout the season by Rosberg played a huge part in his title victory. 

Now if you are attempting to run out the batsman a fielder wants to hit the stumps. A ball that bounces actually takes longer to get to the wickets since the bounce slows the ball and the trajectory is slightly further. However a bouncing ball has more accuracy than one on the full. It is harder to hit the stumps on the full than a bouncing ball. This decision is a split second decision. Now as far as a returning the ball just to reset the game (no run out) a fielder should throw the ball on the full, and not hard either. A bouncing ball may make it more difficult for the wicketkeeper to catch and may risk overthrows. As for damaging the ball Law 42 (FAIR AND UNFAIR PLAY) has a clause: 

In 2008, the Seattle Supersonics moved to Oklahoma City and became the Thunder, but because Oklahoma City was still in the Western Conference, the NBA still had a balance of 15 teams per conference. Same case in 2012, when the Nets moved from New Jersey to Brooklyn which was also still in the Eastern Conference. What if the Sonics or the Nets moved to a location outside their respective Conferences and cause a conference to be short one team? What does the NBA do in this situation? Does the season continue as it is as long as there are at least 8 teams in each conference to take to the playoffs? 

The league fines players for flopping and flopping can also be grounds for a technical foul. While players have been fined for flopping in games throughout the past few years, I want to know if anyone's ever been suspended for repeated flopping offences? 

No. The positions are fixed and each player will have to fill those positions. As far as position formations there are no variations like there are in football. However, during a match, depending on strategy players may either swap position or location on the field during a phase or 2, but only really skilled teams can do this since it is important to fill your roll and have the knowledge that the guy next to you is where you expect so you can pass to them. In other cases utility players (typically backs) can be skilled enough to fill a different positions. (i.e. a player may be able to play full-back, or wing). Nowadays teams like the All Blacks pick players that can fill different positions off the bench. Forwards tend to be rather specialized so don't mix so much. Really only the flankers (6/7/8) could have players interchange but the tight 5 are so specialized they tend to stay in that position. 

Source If we extend the list to the top 10, the shortest player among them would be Roscoe Tanner, who stands 6'0". Is there any definite advantage that tall players have when it comes to serving the ball? 

Taking a look at the last 3 years, the Atlanta Hawks (2014) and Memphis Grizzlies (2015) have had the lowest W/L percentage of all the teams that qualified for the playoffs in their respective years, both teams qualifying for the 8th seed in their conferences with a W/L percentage of 41.5% (34W-48L). My question is, what is the lowest win-loss percentage record for a team that has qualified for a playoff spot in NBA history? (Not including the lockout shortened seasons) 

Assists in basketball are counted as passes that directly lead to a scored basket. I've noticed players passing to their open teammates for a jumpshot, or throw up lobs for players cutting to the basket, but there are also times when I've seen assists count where the receiver takes a few steps after getting the ball before making a shot. My question is, how much time does a receiving player have to score for it to count as an assisted basket? 

I did not see the coverage so cannot comment on their disagreement however when fielding within closer proximity there are considerations the fielder must make. 

If you look at the time of year these world cups took place the time between them are almost comparible. wikipedia list 

It does come down to the specific organisation running the game but generally the rules are consistent. Injury is more detailed and depends on its severity, but I would not call that so much as a 'break' 

In the 4 majors of Tennis, the men in the singles competition need to play the best of 5 sets. From what I have seen, is that if a player plays a 5 setter and wins, they are going to have less of a chance of winning the next match than if they had won by 3 sets (just my observation). This is considering more about endurance, stamina and fatigue rather than skill or who they play against in the next round. Have there been such analysis done and if so what is the probabilities. Like saying that the same player against the same opponent in the next round is a % greater chance of losing if they played a 5 set match beforehand instead of a 3 set match.
