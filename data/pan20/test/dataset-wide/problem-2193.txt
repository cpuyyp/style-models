I've seen soft putters advertised on disc-golf websites and in stores. What advantages does a soft flexible putter provide? I've heard that they "grab the chains" better but what does that actually mean. Is there a physics explanation or is this just all hype? 

This was actually a fairly tough on to dig up. As you mention in your question, the East and West swapped back and forth, and until 1985 the AL and NL were in sync. However something happened in 1985. Change came to the playoffs. The LCS were changed from 5 games to 7 and in addition the commissioner decided that the AL and NL would go to opposite divisions hosting each year. So in 1985 it was declared that the West would get home field as scheduled and that in the AL the East would get home field for a second year in a row. After that they returned to their regular schedules with the AL East hosting in odd years and the AL west hosting in even ones, and the NL east hosting in even years and the NL west hosting in odd years. This was tough to track down, the best source I found was this mailbag from a Mets blog about the following year's NLCS. 

Soccer balls are a bit different from the balls in other sports. They are often very colorful and are a significant part of the brands of the companies that make them. Unlike in sports like Baseball and American Football where a couple of suppliers make all of the baseballs for pretty much all levels of the game, and they are all identicle except the occasional logo, soccer ball manufacturers make new balls all the time (every year, multiple times a year). These balls usually have unique color schemes, different stitch and panel patterns, all designed for different amounts of visibility, aerodynamics and other properties. The World Cup ball is special though. It's the signature ball that people will remember for four years. It usually includes colors and designs that are relevant to the home country. The Brazuca is a colorful ball with the star pattern that can be seen on the Brazilian flag. I'm sure there is a huge marketing schpiel, but mostly this is part of creating an enduring symbol for the World Cup. While the Brazuca seems to be largely uncontroversial (literally the first WC ball in my memory to not have a volume of negative articles written about it), the Jabulani from the South Africa WC had a lot of complaints about it's aerodynamics, causing long shots to float and knuckle in ways that made them very difficult on keepers. 

No. Runs only count if they are plated before a tagged 3rd out (and never count on a forced 3rd out). MLB rules section 4.09 (a) 

In the November 28 2012 game between the OKC Thunder and the Houston Rockets, Thunder forward Hasheem Thabeet was ejected from the game. Shortly thereafter he was reinstated and returned to the court and a technical was assessed. What was the ruling that allowed him to return? 

The answer is actually quite simple here. Côte d'Ivoire prefers to be referred to this way. Here's Wikipedia: 

So if you're placed on the DL on 7/1 you can come off 7/16. However, this usually means you were hurt 6/30. There is an additional short term DL in major league baseball that was instituted with the most recent CBA, this is only for players who have suffered a concussion and is a 7-day disabled list. However, for all intents and purposes it works exactly like the 15 day DL just with a shorter duration. 

We know what a force out is (a runner is forced out when a fielder with the ball steps on a bag that they are required to advance to). But what is a "reverse-force" Rule 2.00 

While it's not really possible to keep score in football like you do in baseball (in baseball you capture a lot of data that would be impossible to capture in football), they do make scorebooks for football games so that you can track various statistics (like you'd track hits, homeruns, strikeouts etc in baseball). Here is an example a quick search on Amazon turns up. This obviously doesn't have a very good look at what the pages look like, but it appears it has space to track plays through the game (possibly even indicating formation, yardage and how the runner/receiver ran his route). It should be noted that similar score tracking devices are employed in football (soccer), and basketball. They don't have the same nostalgia factor you see in baseball scorekeeping (I've never seen a picture of a fan in a stadium for any of football, american football or basketball keeping score, whereas its common practice in baseball to distribute score sheets in programs). 

Each team points are calculated in a four-year period. Calculation of points for a single match is calculated in the following formula: 

I also seen cases when there isn't any offence players around the throwing player because it's the first throw or because they count on him to score or don't want to be causght surprise in fast break.

The reason Al-Deehani compete under the Olympic flag is that the Kuwait Olympic Committee has been suspended by the International Olympic Committee due to governmental interference. The reason the Yugoslavian medalists compete under the Olympic flag is: 

As for your third question, it is very hard to answer it because it can include trophies? can it include friendly games? can it be at any league level(for example english fourth division)? the most league goals scored in a season I found was 134 by Peterborough United at english Fourth Division, 1960–61 season.

When we are talking about professional basketball this result isn't realistic. NBA: On November 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers 19-18 in the lowest scoring game in NBA history. This was prior to shot clock being added in 1954/55. The lowest scoring NBA game since adding the shot-clock was in 1955, when Boston won Milwaukee 62:57 (119 points together). The lowest score by one team was in 1999 Chicago vs. Miami when Chicago scored only 49 points. 

Surfing competitions are conducted in similar format as in sports such as Artistic gymnastics or Floor (gymnastics): users demonstrate the performance for a predetermined period and the referees handing out grades based on the number of rules and criteria. The ASP (Association of Surfing Professionals) Judging Criteria for 2012 is listed here. 

M - Match result, Teams gain 3 points for a victory, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a defeat. In a penalty shoot-out, the winning team gains 2 points and the losing team gains 1 point. I - Match importance, Friendly match equal 1 point, FIFA World Cup™ qualifier or confederation-level qualifier worth 2.5 points, Confederation-level final competition or FIFA Confederations Cup equal 3 points and the biggest world tournament FIFA World Cup™ final worth 4 points. T - Opponent strength, calculated by the following formula - , when the minimum multiplier is 0.5 for team ranking 150th and under. The ranking position is taken from the the most recently published FIFA World Ranking. C - Confederation strength, In addition to the opponent strength, it also considers the relative strength of entire confederations, UEFA/CONMEBOL = 1.00, CONCACAF = 0.88, AFC/CAF = 0.86 and OFC = 0.85. When calculating matches between teams from different confederations the mean value of the confederations is considers into account. 

So according to this definitions the case you describe is in deed a "Closed Game" since you didn't left any open frames. the last 9-pins throw was part of the bonus shoot which isn't included in "Close Game" definition. Here is a very similar post that present the same question with a little bit different scenario. 

Winner - a shot hit by a player so the ball jumps more than once on the opponent side without the opponent being able to even touch the ball. Example Unforced error - a mistake made by the player from quite an easy shot hitted by from the opponent for example hitting the ball wrong, lack of precision or improper position. Number of unforced errors usually counted for statistics and indicate the level of each player's game. Example 

You are right that the French Open is the only Grand Slam tournament without Hawkeye, The reason is that Clay, unlike grass and hardcourts, leaves a mark that players and umpires can check and verify if the ball was in or out. You can argue that some mistakes can be made but that's quite rare, A hawkeye system is very expensive and the cost/benefit ratio doesn't pays. Gilbert Ysern, the director general of the French Open and a former umpire, address to this: 

Drafting has changed dramatically with the new collective bargaining agreement. There are really great reasons to pick under slot players early in the draft. First, a bit on how the draft slotting system works. Each draft position in the first ten rounds has a dollar value assigned. The first pick in the draft is worth a certain dollar amount, the last pick in the tenth round is worth significantly less money. The dollar values for the picks a team controls are summed together to form a teams "bonus pool". They can use this money to sign all of the players they draft. If you exceed this pool you must pay penalties. The first 10% is just monetary penalties, if you spend more than 10% you start forfeiting future draft picks (which also means less bonus pool money in the following years). There is a great primer here on draft slots and the penalties. Any player a team drafts after the tenth round may be signed for up to $100k without counting against their bonus pool. However, any amount they spend over 100k does count against their pool from the first 10 rounds. Here's the thing. The first four or so draft slots are huge, significantly larger than the other draft slots. So if a team drafts a player in one of those slots who they know will sign for less money, they get to save a ton of money to be able to draft high risk players in the later rounds and offer them larger bonuses than other teams would be able to. This is important for several reasons: 

Typically an umpire will shout "Strike" on a strike call and raise their right hand. (traditionally they would point to the right, but that's not typical anymore). On a ball, they may indicate the count, but typically will not say anything at all. From a cursory glance of MLB's official rules there seems to be no official guidance as to the words or signals that MLB umpires should use to indicate balls and strikes. The rule that covers this seems to be 9.04.a.2 

Bullpen specialization is a relatively new phenomenon. And there are a ton of factors that come into play, but I'm going to keep it simple here. First and foremost, almost ever pitcher is more effective if he pitches fewer innings in an outing, if he pitches fewer days of the week, and if he throws fewer pitches when he does pitch. It's important to also note that this is the rule and that many many exceptions exist. It's also important to know that there are only so many guys in the league who can go through the same batting order 3 times and not give up a ton of hard hit balls the third time through the order. That means that for many starting pitchers their maximum efficacy is 6 innings. There is even a stat for this, it's called the Quality Start, that's when you go at least 6 and give up fewer than 4 earned runs. So that's why we have starters and relievers. Now, why do relievers have specific jobs in the bullpen? Mostly because most pitchers are really effective at one thing. Left handed relievers are super useful because a lot of the best power hitters are left handed and it's hard for lefties to hit off of left handed pitchers. Closers are usually your best reliever, would he be a good starter? Maybe? But a lot of the best closers are guys who started for a while and got hurt and needed to pitch shorter duration outings (see John Smoltz), or really young guys who can't yet handle the innings load of a starter's schedule (see Aroldis Chapman, though he's stuck at closer for a while now). Most of your relievers are guys who were drafted as starters and washed out in the minors from starting roles because they couldn't cut it. Heck a lot of guys who pitch in relief even started in the majors for a while before being replaced by someone who is better at it. The fact is that there are only so many guys who can handle pitching even multiple innings at the major league level. Look at the rotation of your favorite team. How much better than the second or third best reliever is the 4th starter? It's pretty stark, if you asked that reliever to stretch out and start, he'd fare much worse. So why not change it up and let one guy pitch the last three innings of a start? This is actually something you see in the minors, and is also something you'll sometimes see in the majors in September when rosters expand and teams are trying to get their young guys extra innings to see what they have before they have to make roster decisions in the off season. However, the problem is, with a normal roster, if you let a guy pitch 3 innings in a night, he's not going to be available for another several days after that. You play baseball every, single day almost. So you've only got 12 or 13 pitchers, and you're using up two every 5th day, you've only got two or three guys who can come in if either of your starters gets hurt or gets in trouble in a game. That's not a good position to be in. Other than the trouble or injury factor, you also have a talent issue. Major league hitters are really good and if you put pitchers out there who are over extended for their talent levels, they will be eaten alive. Most ML pitchers can handle and inning, maybe 2, but often by the third inning, a player is seeing them for a second time in that outing, and then it's curtains. It's a rare talent to be able to go through the batting order a second time, more so a third and even rarer a fourth time. Ultimately, a reliever is such because he has a limited pitch selection (one of the greatest relievers of all time, Mariano Rivera basically got buy on 1 pitch). A starter has 3 or 4 and can mix things up to get through the order a few times with minimal damage. A reliever is usually good for an inning or a batter and that's the limit to his efficacy. If there were enough starters to go around, you might not see specialization like this, but there are a limited number of guys who can pitch even 6 big league innings, so we have relievers. Not sure where to stick this so it gets put in a post script. This is a really cool chart and it illustrates what I'm talking about using ERA. If you look, especially at the last line, the MLB numbers. You can see that the first inning is universally pretty rough, but after that a starter settles in it is pretty good, until about the 5th or 6th inning, and their ERA starts to creep up again. After that you get to see just how effective modern bullpens are. The better question might actually be "why aren't all pitchers throwing shorter outings."
