You are on an uphill swim on this one. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs, and I can say, it's so much nicer to work in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the flow like the first job I talked about. 

I would report him, and encourage others to do the same. The best case for you here is for HR to understand how volatile he has become and dismiss him immediately before his notice is up. HR may not care much about what he is saying, but they certainly should care how this is affecting the morale of other employees. 

This is a work culture you are not likely to overcome, and even if you do manage to work remotely, you may still be unhappy. For six years, I worked remotely 2 days a week at a company that discouraged working from home except when it was needed. How? I negotiated this up front when I was hired and they were desperate, and later when they tried to take it away, I let them know (nicely) that I'd probably be looking for another job if they pulled back this benefit. They never questioned me again about it. Perhaps the same hard-nosed attitude will work in your case. I have since switched jobs to a company that openly allows working remotely a few days a week so long as you get your work done. I can certainly say, this is a welcome relief to be in a "work-from-home" culture, than going against the culture like the first job I talked about. At my first job, you were lucky to get a conference line number to call into for meetings, usually you had to track someone down to start it up after the meeting started. At my new job every invite at my current company contains details on the conference call. We don't use our conference rooms much at work, most people would rather just talk at their desks unless we have to whiteboard. To sum it all up, If you want to work from home on a regular schedule, you will enjoy it much better under a new company that has the internal culture to support it. 

He has no idea what a nuisance he has become to you, so any idea that involves bringing in HR or his manager is overkill at this stage. There is going to be nothing more effective than having a quick, non-confrontational chat with him to the tune of "Dude, you're driving me bonkers the way you pound your keyboard...Can we find a solution that works for the both of us?" Before you do this though, research some solutions you can propose, e.g. different keyboard, soft mousepads under the keyboard, etc. 

If you're the lead, however temporary that position is, you do take responsibility for both failure and disaster. You don't get a free pass because you did something on a short assignment. Whatever the reason for your current issues you need to tell your boss that you're struggling. 

Marv's answer is not strictly accurate; your probationary period ends when your contract says it does. As your probationary period is defined solely in the contract of employment you signed with your employer there's no guarantees that your situation will actually be better once the term has ended. To quote from the Citizen's Advice Bureau - this is a large quote but it's highly pertinent. 

Read your contract Contact the Citizen's Advice Bureau Talk to your employer - you may be misinterpreting things Contact an employment lawyer 

All employees must have a contract. You should also have a written statement of employment particulars if you've been employed for 2 months. This statement should cover everything in your question. If you don't have one after 2 months your employer is breaking the law. Read your contract. 

This seems to be a legal opinion rather than the actual law. Holiday Pay As far as I'm aware (IANAL) your employer is breaking the law by denying you holiday pay. Your are legally entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid holiday a year (or more if it is in your contract). Paid holiday accrues as you work. If you've worked for your employer for 3 months you are legally entitled to 1/4 of your holiday allowance. Note that some of your entitlement may have been accrued in the previous year, depending on when the holiday year starts. Your employer is not obliged to allow you to carry this over. The Citizen's Advice Bureau has a lot of information as well. Sick Pay You are probably entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP). There are no restrictions on length of service under 8 weeks. There may, however, be other restrictions related to your employer which mean your employer does not have to pay you. If your employer does not have to pay you SSP then "you may qualify for Employment and Support Allowance instead". Your contract may also provide you with enhanced sick pay or additional rights, once again you need to read it. 

In the latter two examples feel free to substitute Hi for Dear; using Dear in this situation sounds less strange to me, in UK, but I imagine it'd be overly formal elsewhere. If you're received an e-mail from someone then respond to the person or entity that signed the e-mail - you're not going to be incorrect then. tl;dr: If in doubt don't mention anyone. 

People are more than used to informality in e-mails and it looks weird if you attempt to do more. If you're worried about appearing overly informal then use the team's name: 

This is an unfortunate side-effect of a work culture that doesn't thrive on that constructive-criticism feedback loop. You probably aren't receiving this type of feedback, because the people who are reviewing you are not receiving feedback like this as well, nor are they comfortable with giving it. It sounds as if the company as a whole does reviews to satisfy the HR requirement, but no real review come as a result of it. The first half of my career (10 years) was like this, I always got stellar reviews, and no negative feedback. Goals and constructive feedback were almost a joke to the employees in the fact they didn't do it seriously. I grew technically in my position, but the way I related to others was weak (I just didn't know it) I then switched jobs, and immediately I got some good constructive feedback. After I was done pouting about the first real feedback I received, I got to work fixing the problem, and keeping up to date with my manager on how he saw my progress. I realized I craved that type of feedback, and over the course of that job I grew tremendously, and asked my manager on many times if he had any more feedback to offer. I say all this to say, it may be time to consider a job change. There are absolutely companies out there that take reviews seriously, and work out this type of feedback loop. Honestly, if you are looking for career growth, nothing helps more than to have a colleague in your field point out improvements you can make. If you interview, the questions you should definitely ask around are: 

It could be a trap Realize here there is a chance you've been already caught in the Honeypot, and if you don't report this, you may still have to answer tough questions like why you opened the file. Infosec loves to do things like this, whether dropping a CD in an open area with "Salaries" written on it, or perhaps in this case leaving a document in an easy to find place. The idea around the honeypot is you see something desirable, and then do something you shouldn't (Opening this file). This is a huge weakness for companies, because you can easily be socially engineered to give away your password and cause your company to come under attack. In your specific case, this may well not be a trap seeing that you saw actual salary information, but you should be forewarned that not everything is as it seems. 

An open space is not just about removing walls, it's also about changing the culture of the employees to collaborate more as a team, and not necessarily just person-to-person conversations in a box. Ideally, if you are in an open space, you are co-located with other members of your immediate team. As part of this co-location, open space, you are free to express ideas among team members so that everyone can benefit from hearing the conversation, even if they are not directly in on it. I love when I see open spaces work, Tom and Suzie are talking, and Jim is silently listening. Jim hears something incorrect and can immediately speak up, rather than finding out days/weeks later that something isn't being done correctly.
