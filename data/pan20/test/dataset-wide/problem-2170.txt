It's not only for the interest of the company; it's also for your best interest. Imagine that for a reason or another, you stop dating your Manager's brother. And your brother manages to convince you Manager that you've been acting badly toward him. (Let's go to the extreme and let's say he lies and tell his sister that you cheated on him.) Now she'll side with him against you. You'll be in trouble. With you not having to interact directly with that person (the Manager) at work, you're free to live your life, without fearing having your personal relationship interfere (in a good or in a bad way) with your professional life. 

Obviously there is a communication problem. But right now, you have conflicting information. A said something. B said something else. The correct way to handle this is not bureaucracy, reports or relying on unproven accusations. The correct way is to invite coworkers A and B into a room with you and asking them what happened. You can then find out how to proceed. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding. Maybe you will get actual criticism. Maybe it will end badly and you will need to file a report. But you need to find out in a professional way. By communicating with both A and B. 

A project manager manages projects. If the person's job is to manage projects, the company can title these persons Project Managers. You don't need a certification to manage a project. The stay-at-home-parent who plans the next family vacations manages a project. The parent-partner can call that person 'project manager'. There are certifications for project management. Some companies require their project managers to have these certifications, but it's certainly not standard. I suggest you don't make an issue out of it, until you're high enough in the hierarchy that you'd have the power to change that. Until then, don't worry about it. Other companies do that and it won't make your company look worse. 

There is at least one reason this person works in HR and not in a medical profession and that reason is she has no idea what she is talking about. That person has no experience in HR either or she would know better. Just ask someone with migraines whether they come for a day or two or if the neatly line up. Hint: they don't conform to company policy either. So this should be a red flag in two regards: one you are talking to an unreasonable and either inexperienced or plain stupid person and two you have set off their warning flags. Justified or not, you will need to keep that in mind dealing with HR. 

In the Accomplishments section of your CV, write the contest name, the name of the team and the prize won as the sub-section header, and in the description, describe the task that were yours in the team for that contest: 

The correct etiquette here is to apply for the job if it seems of interest to you and if you feel you fit the description or nearly fit the description. Your skills and your experience should be visible on your CV. If the hiring responsible find them a good fit for the job, you'll receive an answer. They'll ask further question if needed before considering you. In all case, sending a CV sounds more assertive (because you know you could do the job) than asking :) Sounding assertive is good when looking for a job. Keep in mind: they're paid to browse through CVs. You're not paid at all, so you have nothing to loose in applying. 

As you didn't give a location, I'd like to give some general advice: tailor your CV to the position of your choice. That means make sure you follow the standards of your country/region and the company in question. My CV would be borderline illegal in the US and a US CV would be super-weird where I live (Central Europe). Random advice on the internet is mostly given by people who make money off of giving you this advice. And they cannot sell their advice twice to the same person, so it's in their best interest to sell you different advice next year. However, the only judge that matters is the company you apply to. Make sure you read what they expect. You cannot really go wrong with proven advice from 5 years ago instead of the latest unproven hype. Because nobody in HR will read your CV and be like "oh my god, this is so 2012". This is not fashion. A solid CV does not go out of style. The only thing I would agree on is that you should describe what you did, not what your job description said. But I think that's obvious. So check out what your target company expects. Then try to make your CV look best inside those parameters. 

That's life, and that's the workplace. It might not have been intentional, he might have reasons for it. In any case, you won't certainly change him. But keep in mind that when it'll be your turn to retire, will you do the same? You'll have the chance to pass it on the next generation ;) 

I have never been required to show the actual paper proving I have completed a degree in an interview. Now, you still should not lie on your CV, and the same should be applied to job interviews. So the advice is: be honest. On your CV you can formulate it to say that you completed all the requirements for Master X, and that you've passed all the classes in the programme for Master Y. HR and recruiters are not dumb and will notice the difference in the formulation on your CV, so, during the interview, explain the situation. Depending on the job and on the degree(s), the paper proving that you completed a master might not be important, and your application for a job could still be considered. (For instance, where I live, the title 'engineer' is ruled by laws; you must absolutely prove that you have completed an engineering degree, so you would not be allowed to have a job that would make you an engineer. On the other hand, if the job you're seeking is for a programmer job, generally, your skills will be considered, and not whether you fully completed a Master's degree.) 

Document anything that happens (keep the emails and comments). Consult a lawyer about any claims he makes (for example the money). Work through your notice period normally. Then move on and don't look back. Some people are not professional. You will have to live with it, you cannot change it anyway. 

You already did the right thing and asked to share the gas costs. That's definitely the polite thing to do, but it's not unusual that those costs are not shared because quite frankly, the cost of actually collecting the people in terms of time spent for the driver is way higher than gas prices, even in Germany. Be someone people like to have in the car. Be nice, be friendly and above all in Germany: be on time. A perfect passenger is already waiting when the car arrives. For two weeks, you don't need to do anything special or costly. Make sure you offer your thanks. "Danke f√ºr's mitnehmen" (thanks for giving me a ride) would be appropriate and a normal saying whenever someone takes you somewhere. Showing appreciation goes a long way and is worth more than anything you could buy. You cannot go wrong with a box of chocolate though. 

Here is a couple of thoughts: Asking an employee about his/her mood on a daily basis is, IMHO, very intrusive to their private life. Theoretically, a persons mood should not affect the work. It's not the case in practice, but a lot of people just don't want that to affect their work and thus make big efforts to not display bad moods and let these affect their work. These persons would probably consider the application irrelevant and would chose the first/default value. Also, you don't mention what kind of App, but if my boss were to force me to install an app on my phone, I would again find that very intrusive, and I would probably find all the reasons in the world to postpone the installation and set up, and then I would probably try to find another job. 

Apologize. And mean it. Make sure this never happens again. From what I can make of your story, you need to behave more professional in the future. It's a company's guest house, not a frat party room. You don't go out in groups knocking on people's doors after hours. If you want to have fun, go out. 

The first thing that I noticed about your question is the fact that a lot of people are talking about other people without them being present. 

From what I've seen around me, you will not move up the ladder in the same company. You'll have to prove your skills in another field to another company. If you can work and make demos of what you can achieve as personal projects, you can start at the bottom of the ladder as a developer at companies who seek new employees. The fact that you have experience as a tester will look nice on your CV, but it will be used only to increase your chances of having a job as a dev, it will not help the salary. Aside from a developer's job, you might consider management as well. There are challenges there, and it's not un-common for former testers to get management roles.
