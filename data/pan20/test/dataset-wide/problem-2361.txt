1. How is abstention different from suppression? It is not. Suppression means "preventing the development, action, or expression of (a feeling, impulse, idea, etc.); restrain" 1, so they are actually synonyms. (In case you are referring to the psycho-analytical concept of repression, instead of suppression, then abstinence is indeed different from it since repression is applied in a different context and from a different point of view.) 

Is this common sight to see a refrigerator in a monk's room in Theravada monastery? The few times I've been in a monk's private room, I never saw one. But in the same housing (under the same roof), it's common. 

(Disclaimer: Bear in mind this is just a way of seeing things, I have no interest in discussion since it belongs in the chat & this question is very much opinion based. Anyone can argue in which ever way they want and still be supported by references and\or experience.) Does it have to be one or another? Can't it be both? To me it seems a bit of both and I would also add psychology. 

Disclaimer: Taking only this discourse into account (without post-canonical works), the following is what I find reasonable. If there are other suttas which also shed light on this, I'd be glad to know. So, it seems a householder cannot make an end to suffering on the dissolution of the body without being free of the "fetter of householder-ship". Since this applies to the furthest case of "on the dissolution of the body", it would be safe to assume that it also applies before. If this is correct then the answer depends on the meaning of "householder" & "fetter of householder-ship". Since the meaning of "fetter of householder-ship" is not, as far as I know, explicit in any of the discourses, I'll lay out two cases: Case 1 If "householder" means "living in a house" & "fetter of householder-ship" means "owning a house" Then, the answer is yes, since one can live in a house without being it's owner. Case 2 If "householder" & "fetter of householder-ship" mean the same thing as "living in a house", Then, the answer is no, since the problem is living in a house. Since Case 2 seems absurd (because of it's implications) and Case 1 is suggested implicitly by the possibility of there being householders who -have- abandoned the "fetter of householder-ship", I would say: "Yes, a lay person -without- the fetter of householder-ship can become an arahat". I hope this is understandable & helpful. 

The main objective of Vipassana Meditation is to acquire.. Universal Consciousness ,Transcending Body Consciousness. Too much Psychological Stress or Physical suffering ,create STRONG BODY CONSCIOUSNESS . Too much pleasure creates ATTACHMENT TO THE BODY . The Buddha , therefore suggested the MIDDLE PATH ,for OPTIMAL PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT. However , in modern day situation ,working under HIGH STRESS and PHYSICAL PAIN , is quite COMMON. I believe , the spread of Christian Philosophy , is partly responsible for this. Christianity was taught to people living in Extreme Poverty .Live One Day at a time and leave the Future in the Hands of God , is the central teaching of Christianity . Buddhism , on the other hand , was taught mainly to The Rich and Princely classes (NOBILITY), who did not have to worry about their day to day Existence. Buddhist teaching , therefore, is centered around Future Planning. ..Christianity rejects or ignores Future Planning. Christianity believes in a Human, Father like God , who takes care of your Future.... Buddhism , on the other hand believes in a set of Universal and Eternal Laws , that governs the Material and Psychological Universe --on the basis of which , you can make future planning. Modern day Scientists , have succeeded in combining , these two concepts and succeeded in Cosmological Studies. A simple way to start with , will be , to study popular books on Cosmology.... This will help you ,to acquire Universal Consciousness, in-spite-of the stresses and pains , you are living with. 

According to the Law of Action and Reaction ,Every action of the Individual will be Neutralized by a Reaction from Nature. If you want Body Consciousness ,then you must think of Universal Consciousness. If you are concentrating or observing or being conscious of your Breathing Process (Pranayama) ,then think that the Air that you Breathe ,fills the Universe and Infinite Space as Ether . The Air becomes less and less dense ,as we move away from the Earth ,but it never-the-less exists as Ether (Sunya or Brahma ) . This thought will create an Universal Consciousness . Body Consciousness will come as a Reaction to this thought . An alternative , is to study some popular books on Cosmology. 

Advaita Philosophy was popularized by Acharya Shankara , who succeeded in convincing Indian Buddhists , that Buddhism is a branch of Hinduism.You may refer to the book " Shankara Digvijay--traditional life of Shankaracharya" ,written by Madhava-Vidyaranya ,published by the Ramakrishna Math , Chennai ( Madras) , India and available at Ramakrishna Mission Centres.Shankaracharya lived in the second half of Seventh Century AD (aroud 650 to 690 AD ).He succeeded in convincing Indian Buddhists , that Buddhism was a branch of Hinduism and succeeded in integrating Buddhism to Hinduism. Shankara also portrayed the Buddha as the Ninth Incarnation of Vishnu . Those Buddhists , who did not integrate with Hinduism ,were later (around Tenth Century AD) , slaughtered or converted to Islam by force , by the Muslim Invaders. Shankara's Philosophy is known as Advaita Vedanta Philosophy. But over the years ,it has undergone many modifications , by different preachers ,trying to popularise the idea in their own ways. Latest attempt at popularisation of Advaita Vedanta ,was by Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) ,who also founded the Ramakrishna Mission. Hinduism has many Books of knowledge ---the Vedas ,the Upanishads ans the Six Schools of Philsophies. The Vedas popularise worshiping different powers of Nature --like the Earth ,Sun ,Air ,Fire ,Lightening ,Sky etc. symbolised as Gods. Upanishads are philosophies of Individual Teachers -who tried to popularize the concept of One God --Creator ,Sustainer and Destroyer of the Universe .They also tried to integrate Individual Consciousness to Universal Consciouness and to Space and Time--assuming the existence of a set of Universal Laws. The Six Philosophical schools ,attempt to integrate the ideas of Upanishads , into a self consistent logical system. They are --(1)Shaankhya (2) Yoga (3) Nyaya (4) Vaisheshika (5) Purva Mimansa (6) Uttara Mimansa (Vedanta).Advaita Vedanta has evolved out of Vedanta . Literally Advaita means Not Two-ordinarily accepted as One or Zero.So the Universal God , can be One or Zero( Shunya or Space).In this philosophy , Existence and Non-Existence , are treated as two sides of the same coin.It assumes three sates of consciousness -waking , sleeping (dreaming) and deep sleep (unconsciousness ,coma or memory less)--all to be TRUE . And tries to INTEGRATE them to a SUPER_CONSCIOUS state--called the Ultimate Reality. For a beginner, trying to understand Advaita Vedanta and its links to Buddhist philosophies ( or Tantra) , I would suggest going through the works of Swami Vivekananda. 

So it appears these two meanings can be derived from the word. I think some light can be shed by seeing the word used in another context in which there can only be one meaning due to the nature of it's context (simile): 

But it also acquires a moral sense because it is also applied in moral contexts. The next excerpt is an apt example of this: 

I'm not too familiar with Zen literature so I do not know if the term has any additional nuances (Hence the Wikipedia answer. Maybe someone else can jump-in if the term has further subtleties). Thank you for the question though. I didn't know this. 

Isnt the desire for giving up the desires, a desire? Yes, it is. A wholesome one that ends when you reach the 'park': 

1. Is the Pali Canon the only canon in modern Buddhism? No. Additionally, as far as I know, there are also many versions of the Chinese Canon which contain the Āgamas (parallels of the Nikāyas from the Suttapiṭaka of the Pāli Canon), Mahāyāna sūtras & Vajrayāna sūtras. There is also the Tibetan Canon which contains the Kangyur (material which is similar to the Chinese Canon) and the Tengyur (Commentarial works, Abhidharma and additional treatises). 2. So would the term canon be completely synonymous with Pali Canon in the context of Buddhism? Bearing in mind what was said above, no. 3. What is the status of texts such as Bodhicaryāvatāra which aren't in the Pali canon? That text is present in the Chinese Canon1 & Tibetan Canon2. 

I have heard on various occasions that the Buddha slept very little. I was also looking for some specific reference in the literature that can attest to this. One of the most common references in the early texts is the wakefulness (jāgariya) pericope: 

How can you use Q&A to gain good Karma and also aid to realize liberation? By reflecting on a few principles when asking & answering: Asking & Answering Notice in what category does the question lie in: 

Where can I read original Jātaka tales online? At Sacred Texts there are 6 translated volumes that contain all of them. 

This distinction, however, is not "set in stone" or "black & white" since householders are encouraged to be celibate if they feel inclined to do so. 

(Bear in mind that I have no knowledge of Dzogchen, this is only what I found through search engines.) What is Thögal? 

From personal experience: If we don't counteract we might become a hopeless victim of the developing delusion, creating an object-subject tension. But counteraction should not create opposition or more tension, but a middle way in solving the slight or major disturbance. How it is done varies from mind to mind. I never understood the 'letting go' part - repeated as a mantra everywhere - one can let everything through, but if one does not chase the thieves of delusion, anger, wrath, ignorance away that arise during life and rarely ever during meditation, he or she will eventually succumb to them. That is why often meditation was advised as a remedy to counter the pollutants in life, by conscious mental effort to tame the incessant monkey of the jumping mind. Difference between rigour and mindless drill is often confused. It was - I think - always a question of discipline supported by inner truth. In worst cases we may start recognizing the pollutants as regular in our mental continuum, thus not even recognizing them as something opposed to development and realization. I would argue that: Ad. 1: If we simply observe the arising delusion we might be swept in, with poisons developing, if we counteract we create opposite tension, making psychological space for it to fill it later; Perhaps the method is to find higher grounds in mental state (as if climbing a mountain), and then neutralizing the poisons with light effort by analysis of causes and conditions and supporting the analysis with scriptural thought and "good speech, good thought, good action"; If the thoughts are polluted, the speech is polluted, is the speech is polluted so is action, it works the other way around: good action improves thought and speech by synchronizing them. Ad. 2 Dissolving mental habits is difficult if they are long-lasting, clusters of these are difficult to immediadately cut through (although it happens sometimes) one has to find not the opposition and be stranded in duality but something akin to trancendent Third, that neutralizes both; Between love an hatred, for example, one finds a paternal and a maternal mind towards beings that feel both releasing oneself from the duality. 

Causality in Hindi/Buddhism is not understood as in the Western cause-and-effect - as if - 'I hit something and it gets kinetic energy'. It is co-arising: a seed and a moist soil may give rise to a sprout. Karma is an effect of co-arising causality, not of I/O of cause and effect, and it is an extremely complex phenomena; To be in the "web of illusions" is essentially entangling the mind in these co-arising factors and being suffocated or attached to them, to be liberated from Samsara is ultimately to be unbound from these illusions, thus performing techniques that are extensively used to cut through the chain of delusions, attachment, ignorance, envy etc. "It is bound to be constantly reborn until it can balance out that equation. It can't just blend back into the whole again until it is neutral." - I agree with your view (not from a "Buddhist" perspective, but personal) - 'nothing is lost in nature' - it is not easy to "disappear" once born into a pre-existent set of relations. Yet, that is neither misfortune, not a trap, most Buddhists cherished the body as a "treasure to acquire" in the chain of being - on Earth.
