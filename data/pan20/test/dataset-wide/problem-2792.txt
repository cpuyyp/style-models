▻ IMPLICATIONS FOR ROSS'S ENUMERATION OF PRIMA FACIE DUTIES : BENEFICENCE DOES NOT REQUIRE EMPATHY AND IS DISTINGUISHABLE FROM IT Empathy (1) is morally neutral. It is consistent with complete indifference to the suffering or well-being of others. It is hard to see how we could have a prima facie moral duty to acquire or exercise a cognitive awareness that carries as such no moral implications and does not even recognise the moral significance of others. Empathy (2) is not open to this objection. Yet I think it is possible to distinguish it from beneficence. I can fulfil a duty of beneficence without empathy. For instance, I am told that a family is in hardship and am asked for $100 to support them. Without any of the cognitive or affective factors involved in empathy (2) I can donate the money. My thought may simply be the beneficent one : people in hardship should be helped. I may not know or ask who the family are, what are their precise circumstances, how it would be if I were in their situation : I should help the needy, there is nothing else to think. That may be the sum total of my moral reasoning in this case. ▻ EMPATHY AS A SIXTH PRIMA FACIE DUTY Even if beneficence is not identical with empathy and does not require it, might empathy still be a sixth prima facie duty in its own right ? I think (excuse the pun) a prima facie case can be made for empathy as a prima facie duty. It leads in a Kantian direction of respect for persons, though I neither claim nor deny Kant's authority for it.

NIETZSCHE AND THE STOICS A major point of difference between Nietzsche and the Stoics in regard to the role of the emotions is something you might care to condsider. For a first look at the difference consider the following (read past the references to Spinoza, interesting but not for your purposes) : 

Alexander's views are complex and hard to summarise clearly in a short space but, to judge by the terms of your question, he might be a figure worth exploring. 

What, finally, of 'in principle' direct objections to abductive inference of the kind offered e.g. by Van Fraassen ? Fraassen uses scientific examples but if abduction is indefensible then it is indefensible in the arts too. See Stathis Psillos, 'On Van Fraassen's Critique of Abductive Reeasoning', Philosophical Quarterly, 1996, 31-47. 

The analogy does not hold. If you murder just one person then you are a murderer; you did an action that puts you in the class of murderers. You are no more nor less a murderer than if you had murdered 10,000. Essentially, being a murderer is a a description that applies to a person by virtue of his or her having committed an act, perhaps just a single act as in your example. It marks the fact that an action was done; it says nothing about the ongoing mental state of the murderer. Nothing you can do in the future can remove the description. Just like the loss of virginity, the description applies for good. If you sometimes do stupid things, it does not follow that you are a stupid person. Stupidity is an ongoing mental state in which you are all the time (or very far more often than not) unintelligent, slow-witted, obtuse and foolish. If you sometimes do stupid things it clearly does not follow that you do stupid things all the time or far more often than not. And to underline the point, stupidity is an ongoing mental state; being a murderer is not, it just signifies the fact of a person's having done an action. 

'Lost' is metaphorical and vague; it has no proper place in such a definition. I should say that 'a widower is man whose wife died during their marriage and who has not married again'. Clearly in no idiomatic sense does a man who murders his wife (merely) lose her; he terminates her existence. 'Lose' is passive; 'terminate' is highly active. A widower might not suffer any loss at all. He might relish his new-found freedom. Colloquially we would not, I think, call a man who murdered his wife a widower. This is not because he isn't one but because (a) 'widower' is an empathic term, suggesting sympathy with the man when, as a murderer, he does not have our sympathy at all; and (b) because 'murderer' is the ethically dominant description here. He is referred to as a 'murderer' rather than a 'widower' because his being a murderer is a morally more significant 'fact' about him than the fact of his widowerhood. 

I can understand your difficulty but I wonder if the key to the mystery of Aquinas' meaning lies in the sense he attaches to 'self-love'. I think this means happiness or beatitude. There is no necessary implication of self-centred, selfish love. My happiness and your good are quite consistent : part of my happiness might consist in promoting your good. Aquinas's language of concupiscence and friendship is hardly pellucid but there is no necessary opposition between the two. They can combine. If, for instance, my happiness includes friendship with you, this love (friendship-love, 'philia' as the Greeks called it) can prompt a desire to help you. You urgently need a bandage to protect an injured arm. Accordingly I urgently desire to procure a bandage and this desire is a form of concupiscence in Aquinas' wide understanding of the concept. I have a strong desire to get hold of a bandage and this is love (concupiscent-love, in language one would never use nowadays). The self-love that Aquinas identifies as the primary basis of human action is only a desire for happiness or beatitude. It is a desire for (what I perceive as) my good. That good can include friendship; and within friendship there can be, with no tension or contradiction, both friendship-love and concupiscent-love. Indeed, when I rush to get a bandage for you the two loves are combined : I desire to get the bandage (concupiscence) because I love you as a friend. Concupiscence and friendship are two sides of the same coin of action. Perhaps this will throw a little light on your textual problem. 

The 'Utilitarianism' (1861/63), ch. 4 quote reads in full : 'No reason can be given why the general happiness is desirable, except that each person, so far as he believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness. This, however, being a fact, we have not only all the proof which the case admits of, but all which it is possible to require, that happiness is a good: that each person's happiness is a good to that person, and the general happiness therefore a good to the aggregate of all persons.' One point is that Mill does not claim to offer a strict proof here, i.e. one that demonstrates the truth of his thesis - only 'all the proof which the case admits of'. He advances only 'considerations ... capable of determining the intellect'. That aside, and the central point, does Mill commit the fallacy of composition here ? Does he infer from each desiring their own happiness (a form of psychological hedonism he endorses) to each desiring the happiness of all ? If Mill were to be making a purely psychological - psychological hedonist - claim that if each person desires their own happiness, then the aggregate of persons desires the happiness of the aggregate of persons, the broken-backed nature of the argument would be indisputable. It would be a straight fallacy of composition. But this isn't his claim. His claim is that it is by desiring the aggregate happiness we make the maximisation of our own happiness most likely. This is why 'the general happiness [is] a good to the aggregate of all persons'. It must be admitted that Mill expresses himself clumsily. But put the point like this. Mill says that each person desires their own happiness. We can add, each person desires to maximise their own happiness. What is the most rational policy for achieving the maximisation of our own happiness ? It is to maximise the aggregate happiness. The assumption is that maximising the aggregate happiness will as a matter of fact maximise our own happiness or make its maximisation most likely. There is no fallacy in the argument with this assumption inserted. But you might challenge : is this what Mill said or might have said or might have thought ? There is good evidence that Mill did make this assumption. In his 'Autobiography' he writes about the period after his nervous breakdown (1826): 'I never, indeed, wavered in the conviction that happiness is the test of all rules of conduct, and the end of life. But I now thought that this end was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.' 'Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others' : this is, I suggest, the assumption at work in the 'Utilitarianism', ch. 4 quote. [Whether maximising the aggregate happiness will maximise our own happiness or make its maximisation most likely, I am none too sure. And I do not endorse psychological hedonism. But I set these matters aside in an examination of the logic of Mill's aergument.]
