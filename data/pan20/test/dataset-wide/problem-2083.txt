Use a high-quality camera Consider using a 45-degree glass setup to allow the camera to look through the centre of the screen image, and correct some of the gaze alignment of video conferencing (everyone seems to be looking off to the side) Put it near a communal area, perhaps the water cooler if it's not too stereotyped Use decent speakers and microphones, there's nothing more annoying than an expensive setup with rubbish audio Add a telephone handset so you can take a conversation semi-private or deal with excessive noise at one end. Yes, like a prison visit room. Keep it away from quiet working areas - the different lunch schedules will make it noisy at different times. Use it as part of routine meetings; if you don't, it will stop working or be forgotten. Add either a closable door at each end or duplicate the setup in a different room for more private meetings. Put the screens at the same height at each end(!) Put clocks either side (or on the screen) if there's a time difference. Finally, give it a name; The Hatch, The Portal, The Wormhole, the Prison Visit Window, St Louis (meet me at), whatever, so people know how to talk about meeting there without awkwardness. 'Wait, show me that fax at the Hatch' 

If you turn it down, they may find a lead who can sort things out, or another who doesn't know the situation and fails too; given the history I think the latter is more likely. If you accept, then you will have to do something different to your predecessor. Management is not about miraculously making your junior employees work 2.5 times quicker, in order to please the higher management. It is about coordinating your team on one hand, and protecting them from excessive workloads on the other. You can accept the job, but you will need to step up your game - you cannot just say yes to management and whip your juniors. You need to improve your relationship with them and earn their respect, while giving clear feedback to upper management about what work you will accept. A lot of technically brilliant people are bad at managing people, because it is a completely different skill set; why would being good at writing code make you good at coordinating humans? Be aware that if you are pulling most of the weight on the team, adding management to your responsibilities will lower the capacity of the team as it will take up your time and energy. So I would say that if you are willing to change your skill set to be a manager, and willing to change your attitude towards your juniors from frustration to support, then accept the position. It will not be easy, but if you step up to it, you may be able to turn the ship and make your team one that delivers on time, where the word of the team lead on what can be achieved in the available time has meaning to upper management. 

Talk to them, with a view to firing some of them. Complying with management requests is a vital part of any job, so we are going to set up a scenario where they must either clearly comply or clearly fail. That clarity gives you the basis to fire anyone who does not comply. You could just do that, but I think it would be better to give the team the opportunity to change direction, making it clear that you have the above process to enforce compliance. From the employee's perspective you may have been a bad manager in the past, and their clique may be a reaction to that. Unlike the trigger-happy responses here, we should allow for this possibility and create a constructive future direction. It is unlikely that the whole team is entrenched - some are likely to be willing to change direction but caught between two polar camps. By confronting the issue directly with them individually, you make it possible for them to buy into a new option without risking the wrath of the existing team. So the steps would then be: 1. Create a policy or edict that requires compliance, which they would usually ignore - integrating a new team member, following a new process or procedure. It must be measurable to provide clarity so that there is no wiggle room. 2. Call the team members in individually, explain what is happening, demonstrate that you are both aware of the problem and looking to resolve it constructively. 3. Follow through with the policy or change, and measure all team members comprehensively. 4. Assuming that some of the team fail to uphold the demands of the policy, fire the worst one or two, and measure for a further period. This way if there was doubt about your willingness to follow through, they have a renewed opportunity to change their path. It is always worth considering employee issues from both sides (including the one where you are in the wrong), and I believe it is worth engaging with people and giving them the opportunity to take a good path; anything else misses the opportunity. But factions within an organisation are toxic, so the current situation must not be permitted to continue. Thus the approach here to create a fork in the road, point out the fork, and then follow through. 

Caveat: Some companies, particularly technical consultancies, like to move people around a lot. I'm not sure whether they like finding a good fit or keeping smart people off-balance, or just getting rid of older people with families who can't jump at a moment's notice. These companies might well move you across the world and like that you are so fluidly relocatable. I still wouldn't tell them you want to move, but moderate it down to being open to relocation. * I went from being a lonely, fat geeky graduate at 21 to a broadly happy married family man at 31. Much of my need for a purpose has been filled with having a family to look after. 

Prepare to quit In negotiation, it is almost impossible to negotiate successfully unless you have a viable alternative. Not just an idea that you could go and be a pop star, but actually talk to your contact at company Y about whether there are positions there. Either you're staying because you could negotiate, or you're leaving. Both require a plan B. If you're happy to gamble, state your terms If you're willing to stay as long as they raise your salary by $15k, then say that. You've been warned that could get you fired, so you know that is a gamble. There are certainly ways to try to soften the impact for this fragile Owner; say that being EA to the Owner is a significant responsibility and you want to be able to fully commit to the role. You can put it in passive terms ('I would certainly look forward to receiving the pay increase commensurate with replacing Z') rather than active ('pay me, sucker'). There are no magical unicorns Unfortunately business people make stupid decisions, and people who own companies sometimes do so because they would be fired from working for someone else. It doesn't seem likely that you can follow your preferred path at that company. On the plus side, you can get a great reference from your current boss. Get it now, and ask her to put you in touch with anyone she would recommend - you want to find another boss like her, so perhaps she can be that conduit.
