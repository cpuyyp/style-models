Since it's an evaluation of filtering processes, I don't really care if a filter is better or worse, rather than the justification. I cannot find any resource which compares directly filters. Could you explain to me the pros and cons of those filters in comparison with CF? I would appreciate if there is any resource, but it is not mandatory. 

Conclusion Are the left parties the right way to go in first place? Democracy by its nature gives more power to lower classes than upper ones. What will happen if there is a party that is willing to redistribute blindly just to keep happy only the lower classes? We all know that upper classes have more political influence than lowers, but if a party achieves to keep happy the lower classes then they will vote them again and again. Therefore, here's a spiral where the government manipulates the masses to vote them, the investors will leave as they will not afford to lose money, and competitiveness will fall. Edit: 

There is also this concept of creative destruction. Which basically means that old less productive technologies must die in order to free up resources to be made available to new, more productive technologies. It's analogous to pruning. But it occurs naturally in a free market economy and does not require management or government intervention. Protectionism impedes the natural and beneficial process of creative destruction. 

Price elasticity of demand is related (but not equal) to the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. This Wikipedia article defines PED as: 

Economists have been exploring control theory applications to macro economics for decades. For example, here is a 40 year-old research paper written in 1976 on the topic. 

$URL$ As you can see in the graph, price controls policies create excess demand, therefore you will end up with shortage or you will import more bananas. I'm not a banana expert, but I assume bananas are pretty inelastic. Also, banana supply is inelastic in the short run (they have already planted bananas), therefore the excess demand will be less than the graph shows. Whatever the case, price control policies generate deadweight loss and it depends on the elasticities who loses more (consumer vs supplier). This market is no longer efficient and that impacts the welfare negatively. 

Non-linear adaptive human behavior, uncertainty and governmental decentralization of control (i.e., democracy) are the main reasons I believe control theory has not become a more common tool for policy makers. Economics is simply not an exact science. Whereas engineering is more so. So control theory is more useful in the engineering discipline. 

Corporations are essential and they do provide benefits to the overall economy. Corporations are essential in the sense than individuals, when given the freedom to choose, do choose to invest their capital in corporations. And these corporations, in turn, use this capital to produce products and services which other people voluntarily purchase. Corporations are a net benefit to the economies in which they operate because they produce products which customers voluntarily purchase for prices which allow the corporations to return a profit to their shareholders. To the extent there are exceptions to this vis-a-vis crony corporations and government subsidies, the previous paragraph is notwithstanding. 

To be honest I don't quite understand the question, but it's here for a week so I'll give a short explanation of CAPM. The CAPM is an attempt to explain the risk and return on an asset i.e. it is a risk/return analysis. I don't understand why do we need to transform beta in first place. The CAPM Formula is the following: $E(R_i)=r_f+β_i[E(R_m)-r_f]$ $(1)$ or $(R_{it}-R_{ft})=α_i+β_i(R_{mt}-R_{ft})+ε_i$ $(2)$ Where, 

Foreign Investment is not all about taxation. It depends a lot on qualitative factors, such as unionization, regulations, stability, work ethics etc. For example, there are high taxes in Scandinavian Countries, but a potential investor knows that he will acquire high skilled labor and the regulations will not change out of blue i.e. he is able to do a long run plan. Is he able to do the same in Yemen, even if it provides 0% taxation? Also, there's not such a thing "today I decrease taxation", therefore "tomorrow Investment will increase". Corporations plan for today, tomorrow and the day after. Perhaps Investment will increase the day after or even later. Also, there's another problem. Nowadays we talk about taxation without realizing the real purpose of it. In theory, we pay taxes in order to obtain public goods and services, such as national security, railroads etc. Was that 30% tax make sense with the services provided by Au? 

In nearly every public school district in the U.S., one can observe the following pattern: There are fewer middle schools than elementary schools. And there are fewer high schools than middle schools. (And the count of students per school goes inversely as the count of schools.) But why is this the case? Is there any explanation for this based on economic principles? For example, why is the reverse not the case? Why are there not fewer elementary schools than high schools, let's say? 

Yes. It is a fair comparison. Human nature, market behavior and principles of finance and economics have not changed much in the recorded history of mankind. For example, the principles set forth by Adam Smith in his opus The Wealth of Nations are just as relevant today as they were in 1776 when the book was published. 

As colossus pointed out, technology advance is not associated with Unemployment. Malthus argued upon scarcity, but he has been proved wrong. As you hold an undergraduate economics degree, you might already know that economics "best friend" is history. There's no reason to talk about a future technology boom, as we have already experienced it. There's not any similar technology boom in history from that of 20th-21th century. Not even close. Also, Marx has been proved wrong on this subject. Austrians have worked extensively against Marxist Theory (most notably F.A. Hayek and L. von Mises). About the political tendencies and the left. After WW2, Greece and Korea suffered a civil war between communists and non-communists. Koreas' split is well known, but people do not know much about Greece. In Greece the communists lost, but the implications were tremendous. Left parties (socialists) abused communist ideals and they deindustrialised the economy. Also, they created class conflicts and massive statism was in favor. They created an economy full of rigidities and inefficiency. They gave tremendous power to unions and they abolished any concept entrepreneurship. Some Greek quick facts: 

Convenience premium. The market prices in a premium for convenience. This explains why hot dogs cost more inside the ballpark than at the convenience store outside the ballpark. And why convenience store goods cost more than those sold at the supermarket. Put another way: Part of the cost of an item is not just the cost of materials and labor to get it there, but there is also a cost of availability. In other words, when you don't purchase the gas on the highway, the cost of it being available there is still present. Which you pay when you buy. Note: This answer agrees with the price elasticity explanation given by @Ubiquitous but avoids the price elasticity concept in favor of the perhaps more lay concept of convenience premium. 

Are the arguments pl and pu responsible for the level of decomposition? For example, if I pick $pl = 2$ and $pu = 4$, it will go for 2-4 days/weeks etc and if I go for $pl = 32$ and $pu = 64$ it will decomposes for 32-64 days/weeks/months etc or am I missing something? Thank you in advance 

As you may already know, we can either regress the $(2)$ if we are interested on both $α_i$ and $β_i$ or alternatively we just use the formula $β_i=Cov(R_i,R_m)/Var(R_m)$, because $α$ should be close to zero (transaction costs). 

Diclaimer: This is not a homework question. Every word of it was written originally by me. Hypothetical Scenario Alice is shopping for groceries and thinks the current price of bananas at 0.79/lb is a little too high for her budget. Alice calls Bob, her local legislator, and asks Bob to sponsor a bill that regulates the price of bananas to cost no more than $0.50/lb in the grocery store so Alice can afford to buy them. Bob thinks this is a great idea because it will help more people (especially the poor and those on a fixed income) afford to buy more bananas — a very nutritious food. Question Is this bill to regulate the price of bananas really a good idea? What would be the impact of such a law if it were to pass? 

I'm trying to compare the results of Christiano Fitzgerald bandpass filter with wavelets. I'm familiar with wavelet decompositions in general, but I'm rather new with Christiano Fitzgerald (CF). So far, I have understood that CF is able to decompose the series to trend and cycles and it is also able to decompose the signal in specific time frames as wavelets do. However wavelets operate with a pyramid algorithm where the first level decomposes the signal to mother and father and it finds the 2-4 frequency and the trend. Then, it picks these results and it decomposes them again to find 4-8 and so on. The documentation of mFilter in R states the following for CF:
