Primoridial black holes can be found (hypothetically; there is no experimental evidence yet) of any small size above the Planck mass. Stellar black holes, however, cannot have a mass below the TOV limit (1.5 to 3 solar masses) There does seem to be an upper limit1 of 50 billion solar masses. However, I suspect2 that this takes into consideration formative constraints (i.e. the constraints posed on the formation of such a BH); and does not prohibit such a black hole from existing. After all, the Schwarzschild metric certainly does not impose limits on the size of a black hole. Note that talking about the limiting dimensions of a black hole is slightly meaningless as the dimensions change in different reference frames. It is far easier to talk about the mass of a black hole; the radius can be calculated in various frames from that information. 1. Natarajan, P. and Treister, E. (2009), Is there an upper limit to black hole masses?. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 393: 838–845. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13864.x 2. but cannot confirm yet; I will have to read the paper more thoroughly 

I have the exact same binocular, and in fact I also have a very similar tripod and head. I'll take a photograph this evening to demonstrate my setup. I am very happy with the setup, and I find it very stable. I usually sit the tripod on grass, but I do not recall ever having a problem with it on concrete or stone. I do try to keep the neck as short as possible, and use the legs for height. Also, the binocular can have it's tripod mount moved fore or aft, I think that mine is in the full aft position. You might be able to hang a large mass (bag, perhaps) from the underside of the tripod; you should find a hook already there made specifically for this purpose. 

The most likely candidate would be the Tardigrade. These little guys handle vacuum and radiation just fine. So long as water is provided, according to tests done in LEO the Tardigrade would survive on Mars. Even if they do dehydrate, they spring back to life once water is provided again. 

Any gas that has a lower atomic mass than iron. The only condition on the gas is that nuclear fusion with it should be exothermic (the energy required to fuse the nuclei should be less than the energy obtained). However, usually a majority of hydrogen is the best. If the majority gas is of a higher element, we'll need a sufficient gravitational force to initiate the fusion, and that's not always easy. While it is possible for just hydrogen to start fusion in a star, some carbon or nitrogen is a good thing to have to start fusion more efficiently. Different initial conditions lead to different kinds of stars. 

The same celestial objects (stars, planets, the Moon) could be seen every year. So, people figured out there was a pattern to it. At first, geocentrism was prevalent due to prejudice and the stars "orbiting" the Earth in a clean manner (no strange effects). If you stare up at night, stars move in a circle with the center approximately at the Pole Star. This can be mistaken for the Star moving around the Earth. Objects like visible planets (with retrograde motions) were relatively small in number — we have the inner solar system plus Jupiter and Saturn, so people gave plausible explanations for these. Ptolemy theorized that the planet orbits around a "ghost point", for example: 

Pluto itself so bright that Charon would not be visible in the image if it were exposed in a way to show the remaining moons. Likewise, the remaining moons as so faint as to not be visible in an image that resolves Charon. Thus, the photo that you see is a composite of two image processing techniques: one designed to showcase Charon and one designed to showcase the remaining moons. 

Interestingly, the second and third forces pretty much cancel out when the disk is still uniform in distribution. But once large clumps of matter accumulate those large masses (protoplanets) gravitationally pull at the other matter in inconsistent and sometimes violent ways, especially when multiple protoplanets align (once per orbit of the inner body). Thus, the area of the protoplanetary disk is being 'swept up' of all the mass: some is pulled into the sun by gravity and loss of momentum due to collisions, some is pushed out of the solar system by radiation, and whatever matter was not disturbed by one of those processes is then subject to being disturbed by the gravity of the protoplanets themselves. The protoplanets will, over time, either absorb that matter or gravitationally slingshot that matter out of the system or too it's very edges. In short, the protoplanetary disk within a few tens of AU of the star in the center is a chaotic mess of a place. Not much matter can form a stable orbit there. 

On the outset this seems true, however there are other forces at play here. Our measurement devices are held together by electromagnetic interactions, and the strength of these will not change. So the measurement device will hold itself together. Imagine two faraway atoms. When space expands, the distance between the two atoms increases. However, the size1 of the atom does not — this is determined by electrostatic equilibrium (and quantum mechanical considerations), and this remains unaffected. Even if the atom was stretched, it would rebound. This scales up to measurement devices, so they don't get distorted either. Indeed, the expansion of space only really makes sense when you look at galaxies — these are pretty far away (when not in the same supercluster) and they don't have any interactions maintaining an equilibrium distance between them. 1. Whatever closest analog we have to "size" for atoms; eg the area which contains 99% of the charge density; or the nth Bohr radius. 

the circular area around the Earth is more or less the area (there's a velocity dependence here which I'm not getting into) in which a moon-like body can form a reasonably stable orbit. The size of the small "well" will increase as the planet moves farther from the sun, and also when the planet is more massive. Jupiter is both pretty far away from the Sun, and is very massive. This leads to a huge sphere of influence. The asteroid belt may have something to do with this too, but I doubt it (it's pretty far away). However, if we assume the "half-baked planet formation" theory for the formation of the belt, Jupiter may have leeched off much of the mass that would have otherwise become part of that planet during the formative period. 

I feel that HDE gives a good start of an answer, but stops short of the important part. We have seen in HDE's answer the formation of a star at the center of the collapsing molecular cloud. When the star begins to fuse lighter elements, the protoplanetary disk has several forces acting on it: 

The wonderful article linked by Wayfaring Stranger in the comments alludes to the reason for not sending photographs, but does not answer the question directly. As with most spacecraft outside Earth or Lunar orbit, the data rate is extraordinarily low. This page gives data rates for the current Rosetta mission, which are on the order of a dozen or two KiB/s. So a 10 MiB uncompressed image file would take 15 minutes to send. Though it would be an undoubtedly interesting photograph, it would come at the opportunity cost of magnetic readings, temperature readings, radiation readings, and other important scientific data which would help plan our next probe to survive the environment. 

A moonless night is, as you suspect, a night in which the Moon does not appear visible in the sky. This happens once per month, when the Moon is near the Sun. Due to the proximity of the Moon and the Sun in the sky, at that time the Moon is the smallest sliver possible, and therefore not a full moon. This is because it is actually the Sun that illuminates the Moon, and when the Sun and the Moon are in the same direction in the sky we are seeing the non-illuminated side of the Moon. Note the direction of the sunlight in this image: 

It would, if there were no interactions. However, everyday matter is held together by other kinds of forces (electromagnetic, mainly). These are quite strong, and any "stretching" of space will be counteracted by these forces "pulling" the atom/molecule/object back to its original size. So the expansion of the universe only matters on the larger, cosmic scale, between objects like galaxies which are separated by a large enough distance that they don't affect each other too much, gravitationally speaking. 

Basically, if two particles are placed with no other interaction between them, the distance between them will increase. Imagine living on the surface of a balloon which is being blown up. Your size stays fixed, because you're more or less rigid, but items not attached to you will move further away. Your ruler, another rigid body, stays fixed in size (though it may bend to accommodate the new curvature — this isn't so important). But two rulers (which are not attached to each other) move further away. 

With all this in mind, the simple solution of heliocentrism explains everything in a much cleaner fashion, without leaving much doubt in mind. Kepler's laws make much cleaner predictions. Remember that people had catalogs of astronomical data to verify things with. Later on, once Newton came up with his theory of gravitation, Kepler's laws made even more sense (though I believe that Newton formulated his theory with some inspiration from Kepler's laws). I'm pretty sure that there were on-Earth experiments to verify the inverse-square as well. Nowadays, sending probes to space and getting a different perspective has confirmed this with 100% certainity for us. More or less. 

Obviously, the direction of the sunlight is the direction of "up" during the day. If you look at the horizon slightly after sunset or slightly before sunrise, you might actually catch a glimpse of the sliver of Moon before it set or rises slightly after or before the Sun. 

The guide star laser is used to adapt the optics at a specific time and location, for specific atmospheric conditions. It is not, as your question implies, used to calibrate the optics for long-term use. Therefor, if order to calibrate the satellite with a laser fired from Earth, the reconnaissance target would have to provide the laser. This is useless for non-cooperative targets, which I would imagine make up the bulk of the reconnaissance targets. I suppose that one could fire a laser from the satellite itself, but this would have the obvious disadvantage of making it even more obvious when a spy satellite was overhead. In any case, the guide star image does not penetrate the entire atmosphere, I believe that it produces an image just a few tens of kilometers up. This is useful because it is the thicker, denser and more turbulent lower air of which is the most concern to optics. Firing the laser from above would thus see the laser energy absorbed in the thinner, stiller, more predictable upper atmosphere, thus it would have must less advantage. One final reason not to use a guide star laser on a reconnaissance satellite would be power budget. These satellites are as small as possible, with as small a heat and reflectivity index as possible. The added power source, be it RTG, conventional batteries, or solar, would likely increase the reflectivity of the satellite. 

Currently, there's no single explanation for this. The simplest explanation is that there isn't any imbalance — there are large antimatter bodies in the universe; just separated from us. However, these would have to be pretty far away (otherwise the boundary annihilation would be detectable). Theoretically, this requires antimatter to have clumped early on, which is rather unlikely/impossible. A far more likely explanation is that charge-parity symmetry is violated. In other words, flipping the charges and parities in a reaction may not lead to the same dynamics — the outcome (when the charge/parity is flipped back) or distributions of outcomes may not be the same. Usually, we expect that if we flip the charges on both sides of a reaction, the reaction proceeds in the same manner (with same probabilities, etc). There is evidence that suggests that this may not be true. If this is indeed the case, then the matter-antimatter imbalance is not that hard to explain. 

There can be stars (and small star systems). Stars need not be found only in galaxies. There can be gas clouds. Most nebulae are in intergalactic space. Indeed, for a while, both galaxies and nebulae were termed as "nebulae" until the differing nature of galaxies was discovered. Almost any (small) structure that can be present in a galaxy can be present in intergalactic space, for that matter. Black holes (neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, ... ), star clusters, star systems, etc can all be present. Finally, there's a very rare (rare in the density sense) plasma, mainly of hydrogen, that makes up almost all of the intergalactic medium. Zero pressure is an unattainable ideal case. 

I'm not far from you (Israel) and I am also waiting to see comet ISON. Comets are very unpredictable, and comet ISON has not yet reached the critical part of its journey which will determine visibility for us. Comet visibility is usually due to reflection of the Sun's rays on the coma and tails of the comet, as the nucleus is to small to see directly. So ISON's visibility (and all comets for that matter) depend on how much gas, water, and other materials that it outgasses. This in turn depends on how much volatiles it has, how much the Sun melts them, how much the slingshot around the sun and tidal forces fracture the nucleus, and other factors. So the actual visibility that will occur is very difficult to determine in advance. That said, ISON has all the markings of this being its first trip around the Sun. Thus, we assume that it has many volatiles to release and we assume that ISON will be exceptionally bright. In any case, ISON will be most visible when it is closest to Earth, near the end of December. It should be most visible in the early morning sky, I'm guessing at about 4:00 AM or so. This is because ISON will be close to the Sun (thus visible close to the time that the Sun becomes visible). Like all celestial bodies, it will rise in the East. Each day the comet will move farther from the Sun and thus will be visible earlier and earlier in the night, until it disappears from view probably sometime in mid January. You are welcome to visit Beersheba and have a peak through my binoculars!
