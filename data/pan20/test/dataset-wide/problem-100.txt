I think I get the gist of what you are saying, here are the variables: First, culture doesnt really collapse, it changes. But to understand how it would change you have to understand what drives culture: 

Honestly you have no constraints Except for the limitation based by their lingual physiology. The guinea pig is physically incapable of forming English words. Their language could easily be a logical order of the squeaks they make or with their intellect they could make translators to speak whatever language they want. 

When talking about evolutional adaptations, the result can generally be almost whatever you can imagine that being said there are some logical conclusions nature comes down to. 

What scientists? The real question is what is the mission? A mission of scientific research to an alien world is too broad, the entire scientific community would want in on that. The better way to go about this is what is the objective of the research? To that end I postulate this: With the advance of Genetic Engineering the GE community would be hungry for extra terrestrial biological solutions (adaptations). Ground teams are expensive so few can go who do you send? 

Genetic Adaptations Sherpas have evolved to survive at high altitudes coping with both less pressure and less oxygen. In this instance you should try and aim for the same. There are limits to this (The Armstrong zone for a finite one), though im not entirely sure how to math it. Basically, there is an absolute minimum oxygen concentration necessary for a human to maintain a metabolism and that would be your threshold. At a certain high altitude (way beyond Everest) this becomes impossible. But you could slap out bunches of adaptations to raise your current ceiling to that point starting with improving respiratory efficiency which humans have poor marks in. Dietary Options You could editorially create a plant that contains chemicals and enzymes to improve the oxygenation of your people. For instance DEX is a chemical climbers inject themselves with to survive by enhancing their oxygenation capacity. You could create herbal equivalents of this or better. Would fit into this periods technology and attachment to nature. Technical This is the least applicable because it stretches the periods technology. There are historical examples of pistons in the era which are what you need to make pressure canisters (of air). This is also slightly infeasible for an aireal city using archaic technology. (but don't underestimate the ancient Chinese, afterall they did have public running natural gas lines) 

So I have some SME in this :D First, no disguising satellites as space debris is stupid. 1) We currently track space debris the size of baseballs in space, tracking something as big as the ISS would be routine. 2) Something as big as the ISS could be seen with a telescope. So if you got something that big in space and are lying to everyone calling it debris that is obviously gonna raise concerns. Now, currently every sattelite in orbit is tracked and identified with purpose and country of origin. Even military satellites. Military satellites usually have no listed purpose, its quite comical really how easy it is to point them out. I suggest looking up a project called "Cesium" if you want to quickly know more about satellite tracking. How would I hide a weapons grade satellite? in plane sight! We currently launch all kinds of sattellites into space. -What would your rod shooting satellite need? A barrel perhaps? -What other kinds of satellites have barrels? Imagery sattellites like hubble? -Do we take imagery of our own planet? yes Answer: send your satellite into space listed as a commercial photo imagery surveying satellite with shell companies to back it up. Maybe use its targeting feeds to provide imagery data to further its cover. Now, what if another satellites takes scans of it, well you can coat your satellite in some scan resistent material but then you are pretty SOL when people start asking "why does it have scan resistent materials". You would have to arise a lot of suspicion to get someone invested enough to starting battering your satellite with the litany of scans. You could also just structure your internal structure to resemble an imagery satellite as much as possible. 

After that it is a matter of evolutional roulette but its not hard to fathom adaptations to allow large filter feeding animals. 

Why Not? Evolution is not a defined cut and dry process, especially if there is no need for a specie to evolve (IE it maintains apex dominance). As a world building creator you choose how you want flexible processes such as this to progress. It is perfectly reasonable to say in this case: "they just didnt". 

Kill all the stupid people selective breeding 101, got to remove the undesirable offspring to reinforce your desired trait in the genepool. 

Since this appears to have gained bounty and remained unsatisfied, I want to rehash my favorite answer with some differences: Most fears are, at their root, not logical 

Its not really great, but then a cart defending against a dragon even with metal is a tough stretch. 

You cant The only thing that can prevent inter breeding is genetics ultimately saying these two sets of chromosomes are too incompatible as everyone else has said here. There will always be humans or member of a specie who are 'special' enough to cross the line, take for instance the seal who went down on a penguin or other instances easily found on darker google searches. Historically even governments have tried to implement policies to prevent interbreeding of human races only to result in failure, tragedy, and tons of human suffering. But there is no amount of hate, disgust, science, disease, or fear that can prevent all attempts of inter-specie relationships. 

Man's intelligence is his greatest weapon Because of that, no "animal" is superior to man no matter how beastly you make it. The only way to beat man is to make a more intelligent being. Anyways since that rules out GE, because why not just make an superior intelligence chimera. I'd pick Polar Bears They have the high intelligence (problem solving), they are trainable, they are mean, and just like a grizzly bear can rip your face off on a moments notice. They can dig (its how they hunt baby seals) They have superior smell they are expert swimmers Just like other bears they can take a heck of a beating and just get angrier 

How any lifeform works is by consuming energy, storing it, and releasing it. plants take in sunlight convert it to sugar and break that down during respiration. Animals eat plants convert the sugars and proteins into fat which they later burn during respiration. How they use this energy and the efficiency to which they use it is purely based on their unique traits. Chemically, sugars and fats are mechanically the same in the sense they are long for the most part; hydrocarbon chains, that can be easily reacted with oxygen to produce thermal energy. This doesn't necessarily work for a magma eater as any hydrocarbon chain generally combusts long before that temperature is reached. However, the principal still applies, absorb an external energy source, convert it into stable semi-reactive compounds which can react with a readily accessible external element (like air) to create energy. 

Yes and no First the hard core facts: What makes a river work on earth is gravity and differences in elevation ie ultimately a difference in potential energy. In this system it is not possible per say to use difference in elevation as a driver of the river because it must wrap around (because water cant travel uphill at any point in the stream). Fun Natural facts of the Water Cycle: Mountains are a major contributor to the formation of rivers as water sources. When water vaporizes in the water cycle into the atmosphere it's looking for ways to cool and condense and return. Because of the elevation of mountains they can act as a condensation point collecting the water vapor as rain, mist, dew, etc. This water then flows down the mountain and feeds rivers. How to make this work: Strategically place mountains near your river and build collection channels so that they feed their water into the main river. Have all of the streams pointed in the same direction (like right of the mountain into the river). Because all of the rivers tributaries are flowing water in from the same direction this will result in a current flowing in one direction. The river can then be wrapped back into itself. One important detail: Water must be consumed from the river or else it would just pool. But this could be used to water fields, civilization, or intentionally be vaporized to further fuel the cycle. But this is essentially a river, its basically the same concept as a lazy river at a water park. A heck I just drew you a picture instead, deal with its quality: 

It can't, Anything below sea level naturally accrues water be it from the active water cycle (weather) or subterranean water pockets. And depth only increases its chance of flooding. Even man made quarries, which can be some of the deepest holes capable of fitting a human, often need pumps in order to not flood. All water goes down hill Also, If a feature went as deep as the Marianas trench and didn't have the pressure of water baring down on it. I would be surprised if it didn't explode with volcanic eruptions. 

Legality is an ambiguous notion in international disputes There is no supreme justice of international disputes. Why? because in order to have such a thing requires an overarching government Isnt that the UN? no, the UN is merely a body of nations who agree to certain conducts. It is merely a place members may go to have their case heard by other nations. If that's true, dont they have an army? The UN doesn't really have an army. They extract small membership dues from members that they can use to support military action however the bulk of its military might is donated by generous members primarily but not entirely from its security council. So if a nation doesn't follow its rules wont they just use their military to destroy them? Sadly, if that were true, would North Korea exist, would Africa be as chaotic as it is? The real kicker with the UN is the security council. With China, Russia, and the US currently being the most impactful players (as in taking the most politically motivated actions). Particularly, the big five security members have the "veto power" which enables them to instantly terminate any UN resolution from adoption. So Why does this matter with space nations? If you so wanted to be an orbital Hitler and commit acts of genocide in space and declare yourself a nation, you could! The Geneva convention is virtually guidelines rather than real law, with various members being able to get away with playing with it. The trick is you need to cozy up to a security council members who can veto any resolutions to end you. However, This does not prevent any nation or alliance (like NATO) from individually declaring war on you, as that is their sovereign right. If you declared yourself an independent space nation then the country of Estonia can personally invade you, if it so desired to violate international "law" and claim space. So why does the concept of international "law" exist? because those UN members want it to. In order to have trade and peace "law" must exist. Thus the single most determinant factor in international law is economic (and strategic) interest. Whose interests does it help? whose interests does it conflict with? Finally,
