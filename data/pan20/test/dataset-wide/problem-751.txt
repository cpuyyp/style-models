It depends on the composition of the atmosphere. In a helium (or other light gas) atmosphere, your voice would have a higher pitch. If the gasses are heavier, your voice drops. The density is also a factor: on Mars, sounds can't be as loud as on Earth. Sound is transmitted as pressure differences, and the largest pressure difference you can get is that between the atmospheric pressure and a vacuum. The speed of sound also changes with the composition and pressure of the atmosphere. This would change the way you perceive the distance and direction of an object that makes a sound: we normally use the tiny differences in time between a sound reaching our left ear and our right ear. A different speed of sound screws up those time differences. 

Answer based on a misunderstanding of the question, left here because it contains some useful background on WISE. The pie-shaped patterns starting in 2010 are results of the WISE mission (see the video description). The radial pattern within those pie shapes is not explained by my answer. NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is a space telescope launched in 2009 to map the entire sky in infrared wavelengths. 

I agree that the crater needs to be lined, but you also have the problem of maintaining a satellite in stationary orbit above the crater. Nearly impossible unless the crater is on the equatorial plane. Also, a stationary satellite around the moon would be influenced by the Earth, so you would need to burn fuel to keep the satellite in position. 

If the mass of the star is about 1/4 the mass of our sun, then the core's (where fusion occurs) temperature and pressure will never be enough to fuse anything other than hydrogen into helium. The death of this star may be something like a fire dying. The flames disappear for a while, then you may get one or 2 popping back into existence. Our sun will start to fuse helium into carbon before all the hydrogen in the core is used. In the description of a heavy star, it is described as a onion with its layers with the higher fusion products occurring in the lower layers. They use this model since the iron fusion requires temperature and pressures above a certain level. Neon has lower requirements, but still greater than carbon fusion, and so on. What is not mentioned, is that there is still hydrogen fusion occurring in the center, as well as all the other fusion, helium, carbon, neon, etc. 

As the other answers have said, it's a matter of distance. Not just directly (large distance = small gravitational effect), but also because large distance = long orbital period. If Planet 9's orbit is 10,000 years long, it has moved across a very small portion of its orbit over the past 100 years, so the force vector of its gravitational attraction has moved across a very small angle. That alone makes the wobble much harder to detect than the wobble caused by e.g. Mercury with its 3-month orbital period. Here's a graph that illustrates which objects we can see with current technology, and which are below the limits of current technology. 

(emphasis mine). So they're not saying dark matter is exactly like a fluid, they're saying dark matter has some properties that are comparable to the behavior of fluids. 

The easiest way is to look it up, e.g. here: $URL$ Because the moons' positions change, and they are too small to distinguish in a small telescope, there are no general rules. 

The orbit of a moon around the sun depends on the time to orbit the planet and the planet's time to orbit the sun. In the case where the moon takes a long time to orbit the planet (like the Earth-Moon), the orbit just wiggles along the circle. In the case where the moon has a short orbital period compared to the planets year (like Jupiter-Io), the path is like you drew in the first figure. 

They are not that rare; there are 4 to 6 solar and lunar eclipses each year with an equal number of each (on average). 

It is very unlikely with the normal fission process for most of the elements. They can be divided into 2 groups: slow reaction and fast reactions. The elements with slow reactions do not generate enough energy in a short enough time to be able to heat sufficiently to provide light. The elements with fast reactions would disappear before enough accumulated to form a large body. Also a fusion chain reaction is not likely since the combination of material to maintain a self sustained reaction for thousands of years is very remote. 

OSIRIS-Rex has been spotted on its approach to Earth, at a distance of approximately 7 million miles (12 million kilometers) away, with a brightness of approximately 25th magnitude. The Large Binocular Telescope was used for this observation, this has a pair of 8.4-meter mirrors. 

you can see the telescope is perpendicular to the solar panels, so it'll tend to look at objects perpendicular to the Earth-Sun line, which causes the bright bands you see in the video. $URL$ 

Some of those "far more difficult feats" (like detecting planets that orbit other stars) are done by "cheating": we (mostly) can't see those planets directly, but we can detect their presence by the effect it has on the light of its star. That's a technique we can't use for objects in the outer solar system. Here's another visualization, one that shows the rapid progress we've made in how much of the solar system we can detect. In 1980, we had identified about 8000 asteroids. By 2010, we'd found half a million. The red area in the graph above is shrinking steadily. Asteroid visualization 

It depends on what the job is. For continuous broadcast and reception of signals, a geostationary satellite is best. For obtaining crop information, a low Earth orbit satellite might be better. 

It's not that the neutrino detectors don't have a chance of detecting a neutrino, but that the neutrinos do not interact with matter (well hardly ever). If there are $6.5\times 10^{10}$ neutrinos per second per $cm^2$ and if the detector has an area of $10^{6} cm^2$, and it detects 1 neutrino per year, then 1 out of $2.05\times 10^{24}$ neutrinos interacts with the detector. $2.05\times 10^{24}$ pass through the detector unnoticed. 

On the Near Earth Object Program web page from NASA, it lists about 80 objects that passes near the Earth over the next 4 months. Many of them pass within 0.01 AU, the closest one will pass on Oct 24 and be only 0.0038 AU (or 1.5 times the Earth Moon distance) away. From Wikipedia: 

Sometime after 4.5 billion years, the sun will change into a red giant star and expand to about 1 AU. Some people think it will be beyond Earth's orbit. (In any case, Earth's orbit would have changed and likely to have struck the surface of the expanded sun.) The asteroids would experience a stronger solar wind and their orbits would become more elliptical, so Jupiter's influence would be significant. 

The second critical parameter is the beam width. Beam width depends highly on frequency: beamwidth = wave length/dish diameter When you use several dishes in an interferometer, you can increase their effective accuracy and decrease their collective beam width. A bit more info on the mechanics of the Lovell telescope: 

No, "dark fluid" is not a synonym for dark matter. The Daily Mail article derives from a press release by the EPFL and an article in Science magazine, neither of which mention the word 'fluid'. We don't know what dark matter is yet. There are several theories. One of them compares dark matter to a fluid: 

So, servo motors and presumably, calibration are what enables this accuracy. The Lovell telescope has 2 elevation drive motors with gearboxes on each side of the dish. These can be driven so that one motor pulls the dish, and the dish drags along the second motor. This eliminates gear backlash in the system: the two gear trains are "wound up" in opposite directions. This means they can make adjustments without gear backlash interfering.

The only light you would see, would be from the stars outside the black hole. Any light that is generated inside the event horizon would be refracted towards the singularity. You wouldn't see the object in front of you since the light would not reach your eye. 

It is estimated that the sun's core is about 1/5 of the radius of the sun (from Wikipedia). I know that the density of the plasma increases substantially the near the center, and that the volume of the core is 0.008 times the total volume. $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {4/3\pi (0.2)^3}{4/3\pi (1)^3}$$ $$\frac {V_{core}}{V_{sun}}=\frac {(0.008)}{(1)}$$ What is the mass of the core compared to the total mass? 

The further north you go, the time between sunset and darkness becomes longer, no matter the season. The reason is due to the velocity at that latitude. If there is 10 min of twilight on the equator, then there is $10\sqrt{2}$ min at 45° latitude, 20 min at 60° latitude, ... Added: I used the website that @barrycarter listed above and discovered that there are 2 maxima and minima during the year. The solstices have the longest twilight times and the equinoxes have the shortest twilight times.
