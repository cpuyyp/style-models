There is a good guide on existing bottom brackets standards. An excerpt from it: "The BB386 EVO cranks are compatible with almost every BB shell standard (BSA, BB30, PF30, BB86)," says Jason Miles of FSA. "We currently make bottom brackets and adaptors for BSA, BB30, and PF30 frames and are working on BB86 bottom brackets. So look for a proper adapter. It seems that this is what your are looking for. Note that you will need a bike shop's help with installing it as it requires to press away the existing BB and press in the new one. 

If you are certain that it is the upper pulley that rubs against the cassette, you may want to explore these two options. 

These rims should be compatible with the original 26" × 1.75" tires. Note that you asked about frame vs wheel rims compatibility. You also mention hubs that you want to use; frame/hub, fork/hub and hub/rim compatibility issues are different question. In particular, the chosen rim should have the same number of spoke holes as the hub has, and that hub comes with hole counts varying from 28 to 36. 

I have a 2000 Ultegra 9-speed right/rear brifter that does not "release" the cable properly. My initial search on this problem suggested that this could often be cured by flushing with WD-40. So I've done that, and the problem persists. But after comparing the operation of the right brifter with the left I got more insight on the problem. It turns out that if I hold the outer lever vertical (i.e don't let it move), then the inner lever clicks and releases properly. But if I don't hold the outer lever, the inner one will eventually start pushing the outer lever around without the inner ever clicking. So it seems to me that there is an arrangement like this: Outer lever -> Inner actuator -> Inner lever And there is supposed to be something between the outer lever and inner actuator that is offering resistance to the movement of the inner actuator so that the inner lever will be able to, umm... actuate the actuator. So, is there an obvious adjustment or missing part that I should be looking for here. Or just more WD-40? It seems like the problem is not enough resistance, not too much, so it doesn't seem like a lube problem anymore. 

I have a Specialized Crosstour that is about 10 years old. I rode it occasionally and never had a flat. Then it hung in my garage for a couple of years. When I took it down, the tires were flat and I couldn't shift. It went for a tune-up. Hours after getting it back, the front tire went flat. There was a single small hole, so I applied a patch. After sitting overnight, it was flat again. The new hole was 2 inches from the previous. I tried patching it again. Before patching, I inspected the tube & tire. I couldn't see anything and didn't feel anything sharp. The second patch went flat, so I took it apart, and wiped down the rim, rim strip, and inside of the tire. Never did I feel anything sharp. I installed a new tube this time. This held for about 3 days, and then was flat again (I never rode the bike this time). This time the hole was on the opposite side of the wheel as the previous holes. In all cases, it was a single hole on the spoke side and I aired the tires to 95 lbs. My only guess right now, is that I am causing the flat by pinching the tube when putting the tube in. I air the tube up a little so it is round and am pretty careful when I put it in the tire. I'm not sure what to do next and what could explain the punctures? Update 1 I came home on Tuesday, and my wife had taken it to the bike shop to be repaired. They didn't find anything and their new tube is still holding fine (3 days later). I'm forced to conclude that I was causing the hole by my poor installation technique. Update 2 The new tube install from the bike shop held for 3 days at about 30psi. At least it was at 30psi before I aired them up to 95psi and rode 2 blocks on our street. The next day, the front tire was flat again. I haven't yet taken it apart to see where the hole is. Final Update I accepted Popup's answer because it seemed the most likely explanation. I have replaced the rim tape with cloth tape AND used a thorn resistant tube. I will do the same to the rear when I have an issue with the rear tire or tube. 

If the AC/DC convert is a simple rectifying bridge plus filter and voltage stabilizer, it should work with a direct current source as well. The only question is how many batteries connected serially you will need to reach the minimum acceptable voltage. Given that specifications for your lamp say to use 6 V A/C you can go with four AA batteries or two 18650 accumulators. 

You need to service your new fork periodically. I've seen vendor's recommendations to do it once every 50 hours of operation. For my taste, that is way too often. Once a season should be the lowest frequency for the service. 

Have you considered cable pull adapter that would allow you use both MTB shifter and present road front derailleur? Jtek Shiftmate 7 seems to do what you need. I have not used any such adapters myself yet but I thought you should need about such possibility. 

History Bought a new Diamondback Haanjo Comp in mid July, 2016. Rode 220 miles on trails and broke a spoke. I rode another 190 miles on combination of trails, paved and gravel roads, including about an hour's worth of cyclocross practice on a new course that was rather bumpy, then broke another spoke. I'm about 300lbs. I don't ride over or down curbs, and am generally careful, but I do hit some bumps and things harder than I would like on occasion. I am currently running WTB Nano comp tires in 40C at about 50 psi rear and 40 psi front. I did contact HED about this issue, and had a good email exchange with Andy Tetmeyer, but ultimately it was just an offer to build me a set of wheels on the side, and no suggestions for improving these wheels. Question Is there anything I can do to make these wheels (primarily the rear) stronger? Can I change the spoke lacing to a 3 cross? Perhaps changing the spokes themselves to something else? I don't want to spend money on "clydesdale" custom wheels that cost close to what I paid for the bike. Am I destined to just get a new rear wheel with 36H or are there other inexpensive things I can try? 

You can remove two cogs 17, 19 and replace them with one new 18, and then add 26 to the end of the cassette. That would allow you to keep more evenly distributed gear steps in the middle. That is how certain modern 11-speed MTB cassette extenders are sold: along with the biggest 46 teeth cog they also pack something around 18 teeth. So this way two cogs go out and two go in. 

I assume you would use the bicycle in the city. In this case, a suspension fork does not make much comfort difference compared to a rigid one — there are no roots or rock gardens in St Petersburg. It will make even less difference in a deep snow when all terrain features are smoothed by it, and you cycle slower than usual because the ground is more slippery and treacherous. I would definitely go with a rigid fork (no matter what material). In terms of comfort, I would also go with the widest tires possible. 

Look out for the chain line / belt line. With a chain, you don't have to care about this much as a chain will run at quite an angle without problems (derailleurs rely on this, obviously.) The belt will be much less tolerant of a chain line that is not straight. With the pre-centertrack belts the alignment between front and rear sprockets needs to be within +/- 1/8" otherwise the belt is just going to run off of the sprockets. Centertrack prevents the belt running off, but I doubt it will run great if the sprockets are misaligned. Worth googling for this - you'll find many conversion projects that went off the rails because of this. One challenge you may well run into is that even if you are able to get a combo of BB and crank that will allow the belt to line up, the chainstay will be in the way. I have a Civia Bryant and the drive-side chainstay is shaped so that the front sprocket will clear it - i.e it has a "dent" in the chainstay. This suggests that it's hard to have a non-dented chainstay design that will work, and, well... most chainstays don't have dents. On balance, I think you'd have to be really attached to that frame. One other thing to verify is the range of spacing you will have available between the front and rear sprockets, and whether this will be compatible with the combinations of belt length and sprocket sizes available. You need enough range to both be able to get the belt on, and to tension it properly. The information about the ranges needed for various belt/sprocket combinations is available on Gates website. 

It would require changing the complete drivetrain and the rear wheel. However, the good news are that a freewheel coming with 7-speed Shimano cassettes is compatible with 10-speed systems, so you won't need changing the rear hub/wheel. The reason why the complete drivetrain has to be changed is that the front chainrings may not be working well with a narrower 10-speed chain. 

Your frame and fork clearances should allow wider tires. Both in increased width and height. Typically, bicycle vendors designate if a bike is "plus" compatible. If not, the risk is high that no tires designated as 29+ will fit in a 29 frame. In such case, you'd better consider switching to 27.5+ wheels if you are firm to go plus. Your rim width. There are limits to how wide/narrow a rim can be to accept a given tire width. Here's ERTRO guidelines, copied from here:
