I'm traveling abroad for a year, and I'm wondering if anybody has good experience with portable workout equipment such as resistance bands or suspension systems 

I'm wondering if there is any study that compares two groups doing identical exercises, except that one group has fewer rest days than the other. I have seen a lot of conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of rest days, with some studies arguing that your body needs rest to grow and to decrease the risk of injury, and other studies showing that virtually everyone can substantially increase workout volume and achieve positive mass returns from it. Essentially, I want to know the best ratio of exercise to rest for mass. Has anyone seen good academic research on this subject? 

Doing push-ups and pull-ups is great. However, since you're doing them so frequently and with so much repetitions, your muscles are getting used to it. You have to shock your muscles to get them to grow. Now, what does that mean? Actually it's simple: switch up your rotation! Try 1 push-up over 12 seconds: push up slowly, then hold, then go down slowly again. You should start to notice that reps become more difficult and your muscles should begin to burn a lot earlier. Same goes for pull-ups. If you're trying to grow muscles, you should switch up your routine every 3-4 weeks in my opinion. For my body, my muscles are adapted to my routine after about 3 weeks so then I switch from heavy weights to lower weights but more repetitions, after that I increase the weight a bit (but not maxing out) and slow down my repetitions. 

I have access to a standard gym in Africa, and will be here for one year. What program or combination of programs would provide the largest physique changes for when I return to the states? 

I hear a lot of advocacy of squats as a method for producing testosterone and human growth hormone as part of exercise-induced muscle hypertrophy. I cannot, however, find any academic research on this question outside of anecdotal evidence. Is there any research to suggest that squats are the most effective exercise at producing hGH and testosterone? What other exercises do this? **Note, I am not skeptical of the claim that the total work done during a particular exercise is related to hGH output-- I am skeptical of the claim that squats are significantly MORE effective than other exercises at inducing higher postexercise hGH blood levels. I am wondering if there is evidence explicating the degree to which certain compound exercises contribute to blood-serum hGH levels. 

I follow the starting strength weight training program. One thing I like about it is that it consists of few (4) but effective exercises. In general there seems to be some sort of consensus as to which weightlifting exercises are the most important. Several other programs use the same 4 exercises (squat, deadlift, bench press and overhead press). In addition I want to do some stretching every day to revert the effects of sitting at work. Searching the web I find a huge variety of suggested stretches. This is a bit of a problem. Like in weightlifting I am looking for the minimum number of stretches with the maximum effect. What I have found so far are the following: 

I know it's conventional wisdom that muscle mass is dependent on food intake. If you don't eat big, you won't have big mass gains. I'm wondering, however, if the same is true for strength. For example, if I consumed the upper-limit for the daily recommended protein intake for body-builders but did not consume a lot of calories (~2500 calories) would strength gains be impeded? I've seen skinny guys at the gym all the time lifting an incredible amount of weight, so I'm wondering the extent to which strength is attenuated due to diet restrictions. 

I will be living in Africa for the next year, with little access to a gym. I was thinking about purchasing a portable gym resistance band set, but I'm skeptical of the efficacy of resistance bands in building muscle mass. Does anybody have any links to studies or anecdotal evidence confirming or denying the effectiveness of resistance bands? And if so, what routines do you recommend? 

If you're new to machines, just take a low amount of weight and see how the thing works. For example: the regular and incline-chestpress machines in my gym provide 2 somewhat broad handles, which means I got quite some space to place my hands. Every position will train my chest differently. Try different positions and learn how they affect your muscle. Some machines are harder than others. Look at how other people are using them, you can learn a lot from that alone. Machines that got cables can often be used to train multiple muscle-groups. If you can change the cable position vertically, you can often train biceps, triceps and even some lats and shoulder with just 1 machine. Again: see how other people use them and try things out. As for free weights.. well they can be quite tricky... I was always performing a dumbell-press where I would have my hands against each other when my arms would be fully stretched, meaning my hands would move towards each other when pushing upward. I tried pushing them straight up instead of to each other (that would be the same movement as with a barbell) and my muscles started burning a lot faster, even with weights up to 10kgs lighter! The gym can be intimidating when you're new around, but keep in mind that everybody started out with 0 knowledge. Exercises in the gym aren't rocket science and everybody can learn them, it's just that there's so much exercises that it might seem very complex. Last but not least: never care how much other people lift!!!! I started out with dumbell presses as low as 6kg per dumbell, and now, after 1,5 years I don't see much people (apart from the beasty boys) lifting much more than me. Everybody will be outmatched some day. Even if you can lift 150kgs on the bench, there might come a guy around who does 160kg. Train for yourself for shere pleasure and results and focus on that. 

There have been dozens of questions asked about the best way to maximize muscle mass. Consistently, the highest rated answer suggests focusing on whole-body compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and shoulder presses instead of split routines. Routines like StrongLifts 5x5 or Starting Strength, it is argued, will produce much greater strength and mass gains than a split routine. I was wondering if there is any actual research to confirm compound exercises are more effective at muscle hypertrophy than split routines. I'm all for the simplicity of Starting Strength, but I always feel like I need to add in bicep curls or tricep extensions in order to feel like I'm getting the most out of my workout. 

I am a 44 year old male. A few days ago I managed to fall skiing downhill and hurt some ligaments in my shoulder. I have done a lot of skiing in my life and must have fallen a 100 times without hurting myself seriously. Falling and hurting oneself is something I associate with older people but for me this is coming sooner. The reason for this may be that I am tall: 192 cm and heavy: 100 kg. I understand that flexibility is very important and will adress this. Also I will lower my bodyfat percentage. What I am wondering is how my situation should influence my strength training? I have read that the fast muscle fibers are the one we loose as we get older. That seems plausible since we use the enduring ones a bit in our daily life. I would think that on impact the muscles would mobilize and brace themselves to absorb the shock. The fast ones would maybe react faster than the enduring ones? Also max force would be important. Should I aim for max strength or explosive strength? I am a bit sceptical regarding training for explosive strength since I am afraid I might hurt myself. Regarding bulk I would think that it would be best for me to add as little muscle mass as possible. I can probably loose 10 kg of fat but not much more. And I do not want to be heavy since that leads to harder impact. Unfortunately I have always had much more enduring muscle fibers than fast ones. So using say 10 reps instead of 5 have been the fastest way for me to get stronger. But now I can not afford to get bulky. I guess that means I should train with fewer reps?
