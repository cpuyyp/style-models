I'm confused about how one acquires the data necessary to compute price indices--specifically, how one acquires quantity data. Suppose I wanted to compute the Laspeyres Index, defined as $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} p_{i}(t_{f}) q_{i}(t_{0}) / \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} p_{i}(t_{0}) q_{i}(t_{0})$ where $N$ is the number of different goods, each $p_{i}$ is a price, and each $q_{i}$ is a quantity. Each $p_i$ is measured in units of currency per units of a good, and each $q_{i}$ is measured in units of a good per unit of time. But as far as I can tell, we can't measure $q_{i}(t_{o})$ or $q_{i}(t_{f})$. These represent the instantaneous rates that a certain good is sold at a particular time, whereas data-collectors are only able to ask how much firms have sold of a good over a period of time--in other words, we can measure $\int\limits_{t_{0}}^{t_{f}} q_{i}(t)dt$ by summing the total sales of all firms that sell good $i$ during the period between $t_{0}$ and $t_{f}$, but not $q_{i}(t)$ for any given $t$. How do actual econometricians measure $q_{i}(t_{o})$ and $q_{i}(t_{f})$? Do they measure the number of goods sold $x$ days after $t_{0}$ or $t_{f}$, then divide by $x$ for a sort of local approximation? Or do they use some other method? 

The U.S. owes about $6.2 trillion of debt to other countries. Some people have suggested simply printing of the money to pay the debt, but obviously that simply devalues the dollar. It would work, but it would drain value from everyone with U.S. dollars (such as American citizens). A variation on this plan though seems like it could work. Here it is: 

For most goods, we can compare the value of them by how people trade them. If in a free market, 10 apples can be traded for 20 oranges, then apples are twice as valuable as oranges. Likewise, if 10 apples can be traded for \$1, and 20 oranges can be traded for \$1, the same thing holds. When I lend or borrow money, I am essentially buying or selling future money. If Alice lends Bob \$10 for 10 years with \$1 interest, then Bob is essentially selling Alice \$11 future dollars for a price of \$10 today. Additionally, if Bob buys \$10 of future corn today, and then corn is \$11 in the future, that means \$10 of todays money is worth \$10 of future money (on average since future corn today may be evaluated differently then future corn in the future, just due to unknown information. The free market is pretty smart in the long run though.) Can this be used to track the changing value of money then, such as inflation and deflation? (I guess its hard to use this, since both interest rates and the money supply are simultaneously manipulated by government backed institutions.) 

Two things to note here. First, subtracting inflation from the nominal interest rate is an approximation to the real interest rate, but only in discrete time. Furthermore, the "true" relationship it's approximating isn't division of one rate by the other--you have to add 1 to all three of your quantities (inflation, real interest rate, and nominal interest rate) first to get the true relationship. Here's a brief overview. Consider the Fisher equation of $r = i - \pi$ where $r$ is the real interest rate, $i$ is the nominal interest rate, and $\pi$ is the inflation rate. This equation is often introduced as a linear approximation to the true real rate of interest, given by the equation $\frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} = 1 + r$ Let's see how this holds in a discrete time model. Denote your nominal income as $Y$ and the price level as $P$. Your real income is $Y/P$. If all this income is invested in some interest-bearing asset in a discrete time model, your real income in the next time period becomes $\frac{Y (1 + i)}{P (1 + \pi)}$ and if we want to find a real interest rate that summarizes this change in real income, we would need to write your real income in the next time period as $\frac{Y}{P} (1 + r)$ which gives us the identity $\frac{1 + i}{1 + \pi} = 1 + r$ that the Fisher equation approximates. However, if we work in continuous time, this breaks down. First, the units don't work out--inflation rates and interest rates are measured in percentage change per year (or some other unit of time), so they cannot be added to the dimension-less number $1$. Second, it turns out that Fisher's approximation is actually completely correct in continuous time. Using derivatives, we define our quantities as follows: $i = \frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{Y}$ $\pi = \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{1}{P}$ $r = \frac{d(Y/P)}{dt} \frac{1}{(Y/P)}$. Using the quotient rule, we can rewrite $r$ as $r = \frac{\frac{dY}{dt}P - \frac{P}{dt}Y}{P^{2}} \frac{1}{(Y/P)}$ which simplifies to $r = (\frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{P} - \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{Y}{P^{2}}) \frac{P}{Y} = \frac{dY}{dt} \frac{1}{Y} - \frac{dP}{dt} \frac{1}{P} = i - \pi$ which gives us the Fisher equation, no approximations about it! Note that this assumes continuous compounding from your nominal interest rate. If you instead have a compounding rate of $\tau$, we would define $i$ differently, and our equation becomes $r = \tau \ln(1 + \frac{i}{\tau}) - \pi$. However, for the purposes of the data you're working with, I am 90% sure that this modification is completely superfluous. If you want to use something more precise than the Fisher equation, you need to know exactly how your data was computed. What price index was used to calculate the inflation rate? Under what assumptions was the nominal interest rate calculated? In short, while I can't speak to the reasons for your supervisor's recommendation, they're definitely correct that you should subtract inflation rather than divide by it. There's a reason why we use the Fisher equation. 

In Rogoff's article (at least current version) the first sentence you quote links to IMF's World Economic Outlook Database. My guess is that when he is referring to output he means Gross domestic product, constant prices. Looking up the numbers in the database we have 63038.4 billions of 2011 rubles in 2014 and 61097.5 in 2016 which translates to 3.1% decline (negative growth). If I use per capita numbers than that also gives 3.1% decline which I guess is "comparable" to 4% decline. 

More new hires when there are more unemployed (people without work actively looking for some) given the same number of vacancies? More new hires when there are more vacancies given the same number of unemployed? 

No problem. $$Q =\left(\min\{K, L\} \right)^b$$ It just means that first you compare $K$ and $L$ and your quantity $Q$ will be equal the lower one to the power $b$. Example: $b=2$, $K=3$ and $L=7 \implies Q = 3^2 = 9$. 

Many governments try to decrease savings in the economy so that recessions do not occur. Does it make sense for savings and poverty to coexist though at significant scales? Let's say a population was both in widespread poverty and they had savings. If they had unmet needs, they would spend their money on those needs. This would occur until either savings where expended or the needs where met. If savings where bad and caused poverty, it would eliminate itself it seems. So either it is bad, but doesn't need to be discouraged since it eliminates itself, or is good and doesn't need to be discouraged. I guess the problem could be if savings where uneven, but then 

Of course, this will anger other countries immensely, but it isn't technically illegal, particularly since the U.S. has such a large military. My question is, would this work? 

Regression discontinuity design just as difference in differences is a method for exploiting natural experiments. It builds on arbitrary rules that give different "treatments" to otherwise similar units. An example from Wikipedia: 

Budgets are often made up things which are not tax in some instance rent from assets such as natural resources (good example is Norway or Saudi Arabia) or in case of many African countries foreign aid makes up big part of the budget. 

You often hear economists (proudly) say that they don't take stated preferences seriously, but instead rely on observed preferences. Correct? To me both are problematic if you want to understand preferences, since people often do things they don't want to do. Example: I prefer to go to bed at 22:00 but I observe that I very often get caught up and don't do this. Decision making of individuals is complicated and I think everyone should be careful interpreting observerd preferences? My question is: Can anyone provide further points thinking about this issue and/or articles about the interpretability of observed preferences? I am aware there exists micro-models with "Hyperbolic discounting" making preferences time-inconsistent. I am looking for some more general discussion and frameworks. 

The government introduces USD 2.0 (I'll use & as the currency symbol). They will exchange \$1 for &1 both ways. They slowly encourage USD 2.0 (tax cuts, make the banks do it, tax USD 1.0 more, contracts need to be specified in &1, etc...) Now, although they will give &1 for \$1, they stop giving \$1 for &1. They buy \$1 and sell &1. a. Central banks can convert their money from USD to USD 2.0. Now getting this part right is important. At the same time as part 3, certain kinds of debt (specified by the government) may be converted to USD 2.0. Consumer Debt, such as mortgages and credit cards, are converted. So are intergovernmental loans. Loans from the U.S. government to foreign countries may not converted, and stay in USD 1.0. a. The above list is not exhaustive. A list of types of debts and set of rules for the conversion will have to be established. b. At this point, foreign countries will start to get nervous, and will try to sell their loans. Since it is already apparent that USD is going under, and these loans can't be converted to USD 2.0, they likely will not get face value, even in USD cash (since that can be converted to USD 2.0). They certainly won't be able to liquidate all of it, simply because there isn't enough USD cash for it to be liquidated. c. It is very important that you, in allowing certain types of debt to be converted to USD 2.0, don't accidently allow a pathway for foreign loans to directly or indirectly be converted to USD 2.0. Now, the Federal government stops trading USD for USD 2.0 at all. The U.S. economy should be shifted entirely to USD 2.0 at this point. Now, you can simply print of 6.2 trillion USD 1.0, pay the debts, and be fine. USD 1.0 will become worthless, but USD 2.0, what the economy is based on, will be fine.
