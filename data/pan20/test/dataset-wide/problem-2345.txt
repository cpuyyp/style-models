As @Tullochgorum said, the Simpson is a very dangerous area, but it certainly looks beautiful! It's broken down into many sections, and since I don't know your level of off-road driving, I wouldn't presume to tell you which would be best. Disclaimer: I'm not an off-road driver, and have never been on this kind of trip, so everything in this answer will be from online research. I only quoted sources which agreed with other sources, so I hope that means the information is credible. To answer your question about vehicles, a 4WD is absolute essential to have almost any possibility of safely crossing the Simpson. 

I've heard that one difference between a turtle and a tortoise is that turtles fully immerse themselves in water, whereas tortoises spend most of their time on land, and drink at the edge without swimming. I'm not sure if that's true. My husband hasn't gone into those woods, so he doesn't know whether or not there's a pond or other body of water nearby. What is the breed of this gorgeous creature? Is it a turtle or a tortoise? I'd also like to know some other things, such as approximate age; preferred diet; nesting habits; best place and time of year to see them; conservation status (some turtles in Massachusetts are protected or endangered); and any other interesting characteristics.

Last October, we were on a road above a beach in a small town near Bar Harbor, Maine, in the Northeast United States. We looked down and saw two fishermen loading their trucks with piles of something fascinating they had just brought in from the ocean with large nets. I'm trying to learn what they are, and for what purpose they're used. They're round, probably 5 inches in diameter, spiky, and mostly green with a bit of brown. The fisherman was inspecting one closely in his hands, and we were able to get a good picture of that. I didn't get a close-up of the other side, but some in the pile look more puffy, so maybe those were upside-down, or right-side up, depending on what it actually is! At first I thought they were totally covered in those spikes. However, if you click to enlarge the picture and look closely in the middle, there's something that almost looks like it could be a mouth or other opening. My guess is they either end up in salt water aquariums, or at a type of restaurant where I've never been. I know all seaweeds are alive, so I assume they're alive at the time of harvesting, although I don't know for how much longer, especially in a big pile on a hot day. Are they some type of sea plant, or animal in the sense that we generally think of animals? If it's the latter, and they're bound for a restaurant, what and where are the individual body parts? What parts are edible? How are they served? If they are indeed edible, and someone has actually tasted or cooked with one, and has something more familiar to compare it with, I'd love to know that. 

The poison ivy plant itself is not what makes people itch. It's an oil called urushiol, which is inside the leaves, stems and roots of the plants. That's why some of the sources I quote below use the word urushiol, as that's the technical term for what causes the reaction. Most of the research I found indicates that between 15% and 25% of people are resistant to the effects of poison ivy. This source puts the number at 15%: 

I'm interested in the definition and usage of irruption, and what it means in the context of bird behavior and bird watching. I understand that birds, including owls, have migration patterns. Is irruption a migratory behavior? If not, what makes it different? Is it something that happens only with owls, or with other birds too? Can a layman tell by observing a bird if it is one that irrupts, and, if so, whether or not it's in a period of irruption? 

In areas of very clear water, many obstacles can be avoided, and slipping would be the most likely problem. If the water is dark or murky, you're more likely to step on something just because you couldn't see it. Some of the hazards might be more likely if you're carrying a backpack, especially if it's heavy. For instance, if the load shifts you may lose your footing more easily, whereas the support of a shoe might keep you more steady. Also, if anyone in the group has a pre-existing condition that makes barefoot walking less than ideal to start with, they might be more susceptible to problems in the water. That's true for me. An old leg and foot injury left permanent problems (mostly lack of feeling in one foot) so I'm not even allowed to walk in the yard barefoot anymore. Your party has already decided to cross barefoot, so that's probably not an issue in this case! My husband and I have crossed a lot of rocky streams in the White Mountains area of New Hampshire. We don't go barefoot, but love the feel of the water rushing on and around our feet. We wear flip-flop sandals with some texture under the foot and on the bottom of the sole. They give some support, and are lightweight and easy to carry. That doesn't technically answer your question, though. I just thought I'd share it as an alternative. 

Usually when I'm at the beach, especially at low tide, there are many pieces of open or broken shells of mollusks, including clams. They can't survive without their shells, so those broken pieces are left over from animals which have died. Every once in a while, I'll come across some intact clam shells. Those indicate the presence of a clam. They all belong to the bivalvia family, but the smaller sized varieties are most common along the beaches I frequent. Since these clams live under the wet sand, that can mean they're either already dead but haven't yet been eaten, or have just been washed up with the tide and are still alive. When I see clams above ground under the hot sun, I'm concerned that drying out is dangerous for them. If I put them out into the water, are they more likely to stay healthy? The website of the Washington Department of Fisheries and Wildlife has good information about the types of clams I'm most likely referring to, along with pictures showing the sizes.

Define dirty. The question says potable. The stuff that will hurt you requires very fine filtration that I don't think is feasible using natural elements. Filters for protozoan cysts and bacteria typically filter to 0.2 microns Yes you can filter larger particulate matter (e.g. dirt) but that is not (typically) the dangerous stuff. Is Water Treatment Even Necessary? Q: Why do I need to treat water in wilderness areas? A: Regardless of how pure water may look, any water source on the planet could be tainted with microscopic waterborne pathogens—disease-causing pests that, if ingested, could cause severe diarrhea, cramps, vomiting and fever. Recent research, though, suggests that wilderness water at higher elevations is much cleaner than previously believed. Some experts argue that the blame for intestinal infections is more often traceable to preexisting conditions and lax sanitation, particularly unwashed hands. Q: What's in wilderness water that can affect me? A: Three groups of waterborne critters are most commonly linked to water-related illness: 

Yes FILSON is a company. That is commonly called a stocking cap. That is kind of expensive for cap. But it is a nice cap. 

I think you are better off describing the conditions. Like choppy and or gusty. The boat could heel / lean, rock, or even capsize. It is more the captain and crew that are floundering. Past flounder is distress. Crew and or boat need help. 

Vapor barrier liner gives about 10 F. You wake up damp and they are not real comfortable but they work. Not only does it hold some heat in it prevents moisture from building up in the bag. Especially over multiple cold nights a bag will build up condensation. A buddy of mine used one year round for ultralight. 

You asked about access the tree. Inspect it. Push on it. Look for bugs. Knock on it - if it sounds hollow that is not good. Try and break off limbs - if they break easy that is not good. Assuming you cannot find a spot in a clearing then look for protection like large rocks or fallen trees. If you have climbing gear you could tie it off. 

Should work fine if he is set up for smaller fish. Even a set up for large fish would work but you would need to put a light line on it. Saltwater reel is designed to withstand the corrosive effects of salt. It works fine in fresh water. As for bait and lure it will depend on the fish. A local tackle shop can help you out. Your uncle knows his gear. Ask him if he thinks it will work. 

Mixed has had limited use. A wide range just does not make sense as you would just tear up the smaller game. Even with similar sizes would get longer shot strings (smaller slow down faster) so a moving target at a distance you are guaranteed to miss with part. If you do some pattern testing you are likely to get a mixed pattern bigger than the smaller shot alone. 

There has to be a balance somewhere. Limited trails still limits the use and in a way you are concentrating impact to a smaller area. People clear land all the time and don't create an imbalance. Ranchers even introduce domestic animals without creating an imbalance. 

I would not have guessed you could deplete O₂ or saturate CO₂ but evidence that you can. You compared to a tent. A typical backpacking / climbing tent design is different. The walls and ceiling are breathable with a rain-fly over the top. Even a 4 season tent is breathable. 

Clean and condition. REI Good old saddle soap is good. Then lots of boot conditioner as the salt will dry them out. Then water proofing. 

Basing on stretch. Assume 40% or 1.4 stretch. Let x be the distance to the anchor from the ground Let y be the rope out beyond the anchor (free rope) Total rope out = x + y Fall factor would be 2y / (x + y) You touch ground when 

Yes most of what you eat consumes water for digestion - nuts, grain, beans, and meat. Most if not all vegetables. Only limited fruits have excess water over digestion. Can only hope you have enough water to consume a healthy diet. This game condition in which you only get water from food is not realistic. 

I think you mean moisture - humidity is still in the air. What is interesting is the moisture collected only on the floor so it is probably the coolest spot in the tent. Try thicker wood over the pallets or skip the pallets as they let cool air circulate under the tent. The ground holds heat pretty well. 

I don't think two whippets makes sense. Personally if I think I might need self arrest then I want an ice axe. If I am going to ski down something steep enough that I am worried about stopping if I fall then I want two ski poles to minimize my chance of falling (and probe for snow conditions). A whippet when you have conditions you feel you can stop (arrest) with a whippet. And you don't think you could stop without one. 

High end colored tape like used for marking climbing gear or nail polish. Like a gaffers tape. Nail polish is just a paint can get in a lot of colors and small quantity. 

Consider splitting the kit. Put dressings, scissors, hemostat, tape ... in one for non perishables. I like using a fishing tackle box. Athletic tape, antiseptic powder, saline solution, and bar soap all hold up in the heat pretty well. In a car accident with major problems you are not worried about ointments. Airway, bleed, stabilize, and get professional medical help. Ointment and other perishables a small box or even a bag and store under the seat. Or a thermos - like a coffee thermos. Look at Klean Canteen insulated food canister. Rotate out as needed. I would check every 6 - 12 months.
