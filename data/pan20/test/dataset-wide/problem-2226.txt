The most famous (relatively) recent incident of this was in the Australia vs Sri Lanka semifinal of the 2003 World Cup, where Adam Gilchrist walked, despite being given as not out by the umpire. That's potentially a slightly different situation in the modern day and age of DRS when the Sri Lankans would have had the option to review the decision, but still definitely stands as an example of good sportsmanship. 

In this context, a pass refers solely to a forward pass (with all the restrictions that go with that - most notably, it must be from behind the line of scrimmage). Handoffs, backward passes (including laterals) and the snap from the center are not counted as a pass. One very important difference here is what happens if the ball is not caught cleanly by the recipient - on a forward pass, it is an incomplete pass and the play is dead, but on a handoff, backward pass or snap, the ball is live and can be recovered by either side. 

The only situation in which 2.5 m comes into play is if the Decision Review System is used. At that point, if the point of impact is more than 2.5 m from the stumps, then (hand waving slightly) the on-field umpire's original decision is less likely to be overturned. Specifically, see section 3.3(i)(iii) of the Decision Review System - Playing Conditions (Appendix 2) from the standard Test Match Playing Conditions: 

Basketball: always has a result. As many overtime periods as necessary are played, at least under NBA and FIBA rules. Baseball: just about always has a result. As many extra innings as necessary are played - the only exception in MLB is if weather interrupts a game at the end of the season with no playoff implications in which case they may never finish the game. American football: NFL regular season matches have only one 15 minute sort-of sudden death overtime period. NFL playoff matches continue indefinitely. Tennis: always has a result, via a tie-breaker in most tournaments, but three of the four Grand Slams play "2 games clear" in the final set; in the most extreme case, 138 games were played in the final set. Cricket: Limited overs can result in a tie (or a no result if an insufficient number of overs are bowled); the tie is sometimes broken via a "super over", but not in all cases. Timed matches can result in either a draw or a tie. Darts - I think always has a result, but I'm not that au fait with the various competitions. 

i.e. the ball must be struck in order for it to be a legal return, and a strike can happen only if the racket is held in the hand. This then results in the loss of the point: 

It's not a coach's challenge per se, but cricket has the concept of player reviews, where either the batsman or the captain of the fielding side can request a review of an umpires decision. 

"Career stats" are not a concept which are rigorously defined by the Laws of the Game, so anything here is going to be based purely on how your chosen stats provider chooses to count things. That said, we can look at how Cricinfo handles this situation. In the first Ashes Test of 2005, James Hildreth caught Ricky Ponting while on as a substitute fielder: 

This was unintentional, and caused by the pH of the pool being "outside the usual range". Quoting from BBC News: 

you can see that the fixtures are all listed as "away team (at) home team" (the times listed there are funny because I'm in the UK, so the site has listed UK times). The same certainly applies to the rest of the "Big Four" sports in the USA (NFL, MLB, NHL) and to the college variants of those sports, but I note that the MLS site follows the "European" convention and lists the home team first. The "away team first" convention is widely attributed (see e.g. 1, 2, 3) as being due to baseball, where the away team always bats first and the home team second - thus it makes some sense to list the away team first, particularly given the "top of the innings" and "bottom of the innings" names. Other sports are reported as having simply followed baseball's convention. 

Note that this also answers your second question: the restriction is enforced an the instant of delivery, so fielders "walking in with the bowler" is absolutely fine so long as they are on or inside the 30 yard markers when the ball is delivered. 

It has always been the case that overhand sets have been judged very strictly in beach volleyball. Players can and do make overhand sets - see for example, a couple of points from the Rio Grand Slam earlier this year, but they have to come out very clean in order to avoid being called as a double touch. 

Perhaps the most famous example of all is the West Indies cricket team who have won many international series and tournaments. Other than that, the MƒÅori people of New Zealand have had various "international" representation: 

Bottom line: because that's what rules say. Quoting from the 2015 Rulebook, Rule 15, Section 2, Article 1: 

i.e. singles are multiplied by one (not two), doubles by two (not three), triples by three (not four) and home runs by four (not one). 

However, as you've determined, "competition rules or organisers" usually do determine otherwise, so you're going to have to read the rules for the specific competition.

I've been through this kind of issue with other sports, and the best solution I know of is to make it clear why you're playing the game. That may sound obvious, but once you get round to asking people, you discover that they actually have significantly different motivations: 

None. In general, an abandonment is not a result which is covered by the Laws of Cricket; an abandonment can happen only if an agreement is made under Law 13.1.2 ("Number of innings") as referred to by Law 16.4: 

Other than the goalkeeper, there are no positions defined in the Laws of the Game, so nobody needs "permission" from anybody play anywhere on the pitch. The captain, or anyone else on the team for that matter, can tell anyone to move into any position at all. Whether they'll be listened to our not is a different question of course, and that's down to the relationship between the manager, the captain and everybody else. 

(There are some edge cases about batsmen running up and down the pitch multiple times before the catch is taken. I'm ignoring those here as they're somewhat unlikely). Both those criteria are met in this case, so the non-striker would be on strike for the next ball (assuming it wasn't the end of the over of course!) 

As written, (3) is the right answer as 5 players from each team are on the court at any one time. Quoting Article 4.2.2 of the FIBA rules: 

he had made his ground at the striker's end. the wicket cannot be put down by the non-striker's person or bat (Law 29.1.1 explicitly states "the striker" in sections 29.1.1.2 to 29.1.1.4).t 

The captain can use the ball for as long as he wishes, so long as the ball is fit for play. If the ball is unfit for play, 

Your recollection is wrong, at least under MLB rules. Quoting from the Official MLB rules, page 144: 

As the Chiefs beat the Patriots 42-27 they have a +15 ranking while the Raiders have a +10 ranking from beating the Titans 26-16, so I think the Chiefs should still be ranked higher than the Raiders. (Also, the Broncos should be ranked even lower, having won only 24-21). I personally suspect the algorithms being used for generating the on-line standings just don't go that far down the tiebreaker procedures; I don't believe anything later than strength of victory has ever actually been needed. 

No. As with run outs and the more obscure forms of dismissal (obstructing the field, etc), the bowler is not credited with a wicket for a batsman retiring. While the effect of a batsman retiring is very similar to that of a wicket falling, it's actually a different procedure - in particular, a batsman who retired for any reason other than "illness, injury or any other unavoidable cause" (i.e. who would be recorded as "retired - out" if they do not resume their innings) can in fact resume their innings with the consent of the opposing captain - see Law 2.9 for details (or the renumbered Law 25.4 in the October 2017 code). 

The simple answer to this is "yes, this is allowed". There's nothing in the Laws of the Game which specify how the bat should be held. 

I don't believe there is anything in the Laws of Cricket which specify where a batsman must stand for a ball to be allowed. However, there is the well known "Law of Don't Be Completely Totally and Utterly Stupid" - I fail to see any possible advantage that a batsman could gain from standing behind the stumps. 

Vatican City has both a national football and cricket team. However, as neither are members of the appropriate international governing body (FIFA and the ICC respectively) they don't compete in any form of regular competition, but instead play friendlies against other teams. 

No, unless the striker was trying to avoid being hit by the ball. This is made very clear in (the newly numbered) Law 23, but there is no substantial change from the old Laws: 

Don Biglia's comment is pretty much spot on - the soccer team just plays somewhere else, or not at all, when the stadium is in use for the Rugby World Cup. To take a couple of examples: 

Going way, way, way, way back the record is held by the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869 with their undefeated season; exactly how many matches they won depends on which matches you want to count, but they didn't lose any. 1869 obviously isn't the live ball era, but it is the year that MLB recognise as the start of professional baseball.
