Allegory in its most general form is an extended metaphor that runs throughout a work; whereas an image is localised. Neither depends on the Idea - they are affective rather than intellectual. Ubuweb positions Conceptual poetry on the Idea in opposition to Romanticism with its positioning on the Emotion. Alan Davies poem a an av es belonging to the Language poetry school starts off as: 

In this he was in agreement with Adam Smith, who is usually understood, wrongly, that a pure economics is possible. 

Humes critique of induction is a question in epistemology, how do we guarantee & justify true knowledge. I also think, and this is mere speculation as I'm not familiar thoroughly enough with Humes work that it was an critique on the scientific method. I don't think its a critique on everyday 'induction'. If Hume could be sceptical about the neccesary truths of Christianity, I suppose he felt it incumbent to also critique those of science, and the obvious place to begin is at the beginning: what justification can we have for induction? That nature is uniform is a justified belief, as you point out, but it's not a necessary truth in the formal sense of the word (but maybe epistemologically neccesary, as you also point out we can only operate in the world with a framework of justified belief, whether or not those justifications are conscious or with significant foundation). I'm inclined to think that there are links with romanticism, as clearly Hume was a literary man, and he was good friends with Rousseau - he offered him refuge. I suspect he shared his general disillusionment with rationality as the pre-eminent virtue. 

The world is a large place, the ways of making a living are varied; one need not press on continually with ambition; rest is possible - indeed recommended; but also the world offers more to the sensability than that of affairs - politics or trade. 

The Copenhagen interpretation posits a boundary in the World between the observer and the non-observer (that is the rest of the World). There is knowledge (Observables measured) associated with each boundary. But one could rerun the same experiment with the boundary elsewhere in the world. In fact one should perhaps take into account all such boundaries. It should be possible to turn this into a topology on the space. Each Open (that is Boundary) will have associated Knowledge which will then vary in some particular way. This very much reminds me of sheaf-theoretic techniques in Geometry. Is then a sheaf-theoretic interpretation possible or advisable? Has any work been done in this direction? Of course sheaf-theory has an alternative incarnation as an etale bundle. So if the first is possible then a bundle interpretation should be possible. The real intent of this question isn't mathematical, but philosophical - that is a certain experiment is run and a priviliged observer is given ontological status. This appears to me not quite right. All possible observers should be given the same status. The question is then how do these local observers become a global one. The global patching of local data is what sheaf-theory is designed to accomplish. 

Truth & relevance are two different but related things. For example it is true that 120000007+1=120000008 but no one cares about this particular result, to most people at most times that this is true is irrelevant. Why is this different from the truth and relevance say of 1+1=2. Because this latter statement is the one by which one can be inspired to think through a general theory of addition in a way the first statement is unlikely to inspire. Mathematical truth can also be relative. For whilst 1+1=2 in the ring Z, it equals zero in the ring Z/2Z. One might answer this by saying that the ring Z was understood implicitly... 

When Marx was writing the system that is called Capitalism was prevelant in a small number of North European nation states, predominantly England; though he traced it back to the commercial city states of Northern Italy; this was one of the reasons he emigrated to England - to study its effects and causes at first hand. Capitalism should be distinguished from the petty capitalisms of the classical civilisations of Islam & Rome; the immediate precursors of Capitalism. Its also worth noting that contra the physical & biological sciences that his science isn't attempting to uncover the laws of motion for all economies for all time - it is not a universal theory as Newtons theory of Gravitation was a universal theory - but that it was a historically & socially constituted description & critique; he wrote that a new economic & political order would demand a new analysis. As an astute observer of the Capitalism regime he predicted that it would cover the globe - ie what is now known as Globalisation (in at least some senses). He also admired the energy of the bourgeois (as opposed to the feudal order) which he considered would transform the relations of production throughout the globe; part of this must be at least predicated on the global extent of the colonial empire which would ease the introduction of these new methods. 

Was neoplatonism a synthesis of Jewish & Platonic monotheism? Neoplatonism was a school of mystical philosophy synthesising Jewish theology and Platos philosophy. Its major theorist & practitioner is Plotinus. But there appears to be two dialogues of Plato in which such a philosophy could be drawn from - that is Parmenides and Timaeus. Obviously monotheism is not usually associated with Plato. But consider that Parmenides is a discussion on the intrinsic nature of the One; and that in Timaeus he discusses how the Grand Artificer/Craftsman created the world. There is no indication that these are the same; but he expects the creation story to be taken seriously in some manner if the following passage is any indication: 

Yes, so long as one sticks to a discipline. For then there are acceptable canons and authorities by which one can make an informed and justified opinion. Within a discipline, taste and judgement is trained and trainable, though the extent it can be so done is obviously dependent on an individual talents, capacities and opportunities. 

Kant was interested in how consciousness apprehends reality directly as well as conceptually, he regards space and time as part of our inner sense which enables experience. That physical reality conceptually and in reality is non-euclidean, that there are other geometries available does not obviate the fact that our immediate experience of the space around us is euclidean (in an intuitive sense and not intellectual). Were we creatures that evolved in another possible world where the curvature of spacetime was visible & appreciable on the human scale and immediately apprensible to us in some manner then that would be the geometry he would have used. He also distinguished analytic and synthetic propositions into two kinds - a priori and a postereroi, and asked the question are synthetic a priori propositions are possible - which he claims is a question never before asked - why, because, on the face of it this appears impossible - how can something be before experience & also of experience. Because he supposes what he calls our intuition enables the conditions of our experience, he concludes that there are such propositions - and they are space & time. 

In Physics there are two large themes in conceptualising the world - atoms & waves. I'm familiar with the work of the greek atomists, is there a philosophical precursor to waves? From what I've understood Aristotle argued against atomism so presumably he must be arguing for a continua of some kind. Does this tie in with the idea of substance?
