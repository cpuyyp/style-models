Yes. Free fall means the only force acting on a body is gravity. The only force acting on the Earth and every other body in orbit is gravity, so all the planets are in free fall. (There are very small forces from, for example, solar wind but these are minute in comparison to the gravitational forces) 

Image from Wikipedia, adapted from image by NASA Our eyes have evolved to take advantage of the transparency at these wavelengths. If we had evolved in an atmosphere with a very different mix of gases. One in which visible light was absorbed, we would have evolved eyes that see different wavelengths. There is a notable "window" at about $10\mu m$ in the diagram above. And you might wonder if any animal has evolved to see in this window. However, our own bodies emit thermal radiation at about $10\mu m$, eyes wouldn't work as they would be swamped by their own glow. However this window is used by thermal imaging devices. 

Gamma ray bursts are very rarely bright enough in visible light to be seen with the naked eye. This is why they weren't detected until there was a network of satellites looking for atom bombs. You didn't see a GRB. If what you saw was Bright, and Fast it was likely to be a bright meteor, sometimes called a fireball. These appear as a very bright, fast-moving "shooting star". They are rare, but not so rare that it would be possible to identify a particular event from the information that you give. A reflection from a satellite can look like a star that brightens and then fades. The Iridium satellites are well known for this though other satellites can also produce "flares". Iridium flares have been visible since the late 90s. There are other mundane possibilities, but these would seem to be the most likely. Remember memory is a funny thing. After 20+ years thing that you "remember" might be different. 

The best model we have is that of electro-weak unification. The photon is an quantum of the electromagnetic field, and as long as there has been an electromagnetic field, excitation of the field have existed. The "weak" nuclear interaction is another field, (it has the effect of changing up quarks to down quarks, and so is responsible for beta decay of radioactive material). Quanta of the weak field are rather different from photons. They are charged and have mass, but at very high energies (a million billion degrees or so) the electromagnetic and weak fields are unified into a single "electroweak" interaction. But after the universe had cooled (it took sometime between $10^{-36}$ and $10^{-32}$ seconds) the weak and electromagnetic fields split, and the first true photons formed. These photons didn't get very far before colliding with other particles that were being formed. As you note, it took nearly 400000 years until the universe cooled enough to become transparent. Now you mention visible light. The photons formed after the split would have had very high energies, we would call most of them gamma rays if they existed today. But as photon of all energies could be formed, a small fraction would have been in the visible range. At recombination, when the universe became transparent, the temperature was about 3000K, at which temperature most photons are in the infra red range, but enough are visible to have given the universe a very bright orange-red colour, similar to the colour of a lightbulb. 

The nodes are the two points on the orbit of the moon at which the plane of the orbit crosses the elliptic. The position of the nodes change in a predictable way due to the perturbation by the sun (and the other planets). Since the orbit is constantly changing, the position of the longitude. The node is not the position where the crossing last occurred. Rather it is the intersection of two imaginary lines in the sky, the ecliptic and the orbit of the moon. The position of the nodes are measured as an angle, clockwise from the first point of Aries, thus it is a longitude, or right ascension. On the first of September 2016 the longitude of the ascending node of the moon is 162.484 degrees, and decreasing slowly. The linked pdf indicates a value of 12♍41, apparently this means 12 degrees 41 minutes within Virgo. The notation is not used in astronomy. If you are interested in the scientific study of the sky you should be aware that astro.com is an astrology website. The presentation of ephemeris may not represent scientific practice. I consider modern astrology to be pseudoscience and fraudulent. 

If you want to be accurate, there is no simple way. Even the method below is approximate, as it doesn't account for gravitational perturbations from other planets. Using Kepler's method you first calculate the mean anomaly, then solve Kepler's equation to find the True anomaly. The True anomaly is the angular position of the planet from the perihelion. Next you calculate the cartesian position of the planet in heliocentric coordinates, using the geometry of an ellipse Then you repeat the whole calculation for the Earth. You can then calculate the position of the planet relative to the Earth, and convert that cartesian position to the spherical coordinates of right ascension and declension. Finally if you need telescope pointing coordinates, you use the location and time to convert to a position in the sky. $URL$ describes the process in more detail. There are also tools that can do this (Eg $URL$ 

Yes, and it is not uncommon for an orbit have an eccentricity close to one. The wikipedia site, linked in a comment above, notes C/1980 E1, which entered the inner solar system with an eccentricity close to one, but had a close encounter with jupiter and was accelerated. It left the inner solar system with a eccentricity of 1.05, and so is on a hyperbolic trajectory, and will escape from the sun's gravity Orbits that are highly hyperbolic are very unlikely. Comets formed as part of the solar system. They are not really harder to spot than any other comet. A comet takes many months to make its passage through the inner solar system. There is plenty of time for them to be spotted, especially if you have probes like SOHO or NEAT 

Minutes of a degree are "minúte". There are a few things that could cause errors. One is atmospheric refraction: it can cause an error of about 1 minute at the an alt of 45degrees, and over 30minutes on the horizon. When observing objects close to the horizon, this is a sigificant source of error Its pretty much impossible to check without access to the source code. However There is plenty of astronomical software that can calulate Az-Alt positions. Pyephem, xephem, stellarium come to mind, and you can ask them to calculate with or without atmospheric distortion. 

For the asteroid not to break up it needs to either be big, or tough. You can experiment with the impact effects calculator but you should notice that a rocky asteroid with a diameter of less than about 1km will partially break up on impact with the atmosphere, and there may be multiple craters formed. If the asteroid is less than about 100m in diameter than the breakup will be complete enough that the resulting meteorites will fall at terminal velocity, and won't form craters in rock. Iron meteorites are tougher, but even these are likely to break up if they are less than 500m in diameter. Needless to say, these are not small events, and we have never actually witnessed any object hitting the Earth that is large enough to make it through our atmosphere in one piece. The direct answer to the question is that there are no typical small impacts of bodies that don't break up. The Barringer "meteor crator" impactor was an iron asteroid, with a diameter of about 40 or 50m, that broke up on impact with the atmosphere, and fell in a circle of about 150m in diameter, forming the 1km diameter crater we see now. The mass of the impactor was about 1 to 2 million tonnes. It hit the atmosphere at about 15 to 17 km/s but by the time it reached Earth, it had slowed to less than 12 km/s. It exploded with the energy of about 10 Megatonnes of TNT. The dispersal of the fragments was not enough to from several craters. See a barringer type impact Or read about the impact
