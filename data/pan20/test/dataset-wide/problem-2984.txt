Shoemaker proposes that identical persons are individuals who are psychologically continuous and share the same brain. This is the brain theory of personal identity. However, Parfit takes objection to this with his brain-division thought experiment. Suppose you severed person A's corpus callosum, and put one hemisphere into person B, and another hemisphere into person C. What, then is the identity relationship between A, B and C? This can be thought to be a valid objection to brain theory because: 

Analytic philosophy primarily tries to solve problems a priori. Science can be considered to be synthetic a posteriori, based of some a priori theoretical framework. But would any conclusions that you come to (rigorously and objectively) through a posteriori analysis be considered scientific? 

I think this is not about randomness vs objectiveness but rather randomness vs nothing being actually random. Objectivity has it's own opposite: relativity. Because of relativity we have big problems determining what's what, therefore objectivity is recommended specially when dealing with advanced physics, universal laws and such things. 1+1 will always equal 2 only if the correct rules are applied, just as the author said. Otherwise, 1+1 = 2 is not true. As a rule-based example: 1+1 = 10 if the base rule is that we deal with a binary system. To discover if there is any true randomness somewhere in the Universe may not be that easy. For example anything natural is related to Golden Ratio and/or Fibonacci, so there's nothing random in living organisms or plants (not even at DNA level). Going from DNA level and atoms to a very large scale like galaxies, we will notice that even the stars have a non-random arrangement in galaxies. So from an Universal point of view, the vote goes against randomness (note: not to be confused with chaos). That being said, what's left to do is try to generate our own synthetic randomness, just to prove that it can be done. But in this situation, we may find that this isn't easy either. In the case of computers, it's well known that numbers generated using them aren't genuinely random. Any piece of software needs some kind of unpredictable physical input to be able to generate from there. But what about humans ? Well, most of the choices they make are based on something quite pre-determined so we don't get much randomness from there. but as we trick the computer giving it physical input, we could find a way to bypass the human pre-determined concepts so we get something random out of it. Let's design a situation. We have the drawing of a cube. Any sane mature human should understand that those lines drawn in 2D are the representation of a 3D cube. But the orientation of the cube cannot be determined from the 2D drawing, so each human would have to pick a way he thinks the cube orientation is. 

Aristotle discusses two types of justice - one, more general justice that concerns having all the virtues, and a second justice concerning how a state should act. He believes, if I'm not mistaken, in meritocracy. Certain individuals are more deserving of things than others, so justice, as far as states are concerned, does not equal or imply equality. I'm forming an argument regarding the duties of individuals, so I'm not concerned with his second type of justice, but his first. But given his ideas in the second type of justice, does he also disregard equality in his first individual-based justice? 

The "hook" symbol for implication (⊃) is the same symbol for superset. Is this just a coincidence, or is there a relationship between these two ideas? 

Why do we qualify "implication" with "material"? This seems to imply that there are other kinds of implication. 

I understand that ≡ is logical equivalence, "iff". = is a symbol for numerical equivalence. And := is an identity claim. I often only see = and := used with variables and names, while ≡ only appears with predicates. I'm not sure if this is just from my limited exposure to logic or an actual convention. What's the big difference if we were to say a=b vs a≡b?. Or, for that matter, Px:=Qy? 

One does not have to agree to a conclusion if he agrees to all the facts leading to it. Example: you can have 5 symptoms and a nurse can maybe formulate a diagnostic bases on that. But the doctor with many years of experience may independently check that all 5 symptoms exists and manifest as described by the nurse but he may set a totally different diagnostic. Hegel himself admitted that his dialectical method was part of a philosophical tradition dating back to Plato but he criticized Plato’s version of dialectics. Hegel argued that Plato’s dialectics deals only with limited philosophical claims and is unable to get beyond skepticism or nothingness. According to the logic of a classic reduction to absurd argument, if the premises of an argument lead to a contradiction, we must conclude that the premises are false. That leaves us with practically nothing. In turn, Karl Marx presented his own dialectic method, which he claims to be a direct opposite of Hegel's method. Direct quote from Marx in the paper "Afterword": 

Democracy is not ethically better or worse than other systems, and so, taking that into account, I only see one reason why it might be considered unethical to not take into account the majority's voice, and that is if doing so violates the social contract. The social contract is a justification of government - the people who will be ruled consciously* choose to give up certain rights in exchange for security, civil liberties, and other benefits. If one of the civil liberties promised in the social contract is the right to political participation by rule of majority, then to ignore the majority's voice is to violate that right, and thus the social contract, rendering the government illegitimate. *I emphasize consciously here just as a note, since the idea of tacit consent is still debatable. Other than the above scenario, I don't see it as unethical to override a majority. Of course, some frameworks, such as a utilitarian framework, say we should maximize the majority's pleasure and prioritize that over a minority's pleasure, but that in no way implies listening to the majority. If you morally obliged in a position of power - meaning, if you have a moral obligation to do X, and have the power right to do X - to override a majority vote, then you, following a principle of civil disobedience, must override that majority. 

By choosing the orientation the humans think the cube may have, we can say that we generated a random sequence of 0s and 1s. But is it truly so ? If we do this test to thousands or more, we may find that a selection is way more preferred compared to the other. That means some other pre-determined factor (like spatial orientation capabilities, geometry knowledge, the distance between the eyes and object) influences the choice. So in order to actually have the random result we must consider all these factors when making the test. So basically, if we are able to account for everything involved, we may find a trick to generate something truly random. Otherwise...slim chances. 

The identity of person A cannot be definitely associated with person B or C Person A is psychologically continuous with B and C, A, B, and C all share the same brain. 

The only x and y principle states that the relation between "x=y" only depends on facts about x & y. So if we say something like "Bob is this particular human being" then this relationship is only determined by facts about "Bob" and facts about "this particular human being". Many people seem to say that violating this principle is a problem for personal identity issues. But I really don't see how this is an issue. For instance, facts about "Bob" are contingent on facts about "Bob's mother" who named him. What's the main problem about violating this? 

University research is not a guarantee for accuracy of theory. Any theory can get to be widely accepted and then something else comes in that invalidates the initial theory. It's how science evolves. Given this and how today's science and specially physics tends to work, I'd rather trust an independent research of a small group of scientists than that of an university's research. The logic is most of the time university projects are bound to comply by the very restrictive already established theories (there are exceptions, but they do not form a majority) while independent research can practically dig in any direction unrestricted. So far this approach worked very well for my research teams. 

Ok, maybe I'm misunderstanding Parfit's thought experiment, but I'm having trouble rectifying premise 3 (that A B and C share the same brain). If you sever the corpus callosum, and put fragments of A's brain into other bodies, how could you possibly claim that those fragments are numerically identical to A's original, unified brain? Of course I understand it's a thought experiment, and that this doesn't have to be practically possible, but really, I'm finding this a bit of a stretch--which I suspect is because I'm misunderstanding the thought experiment. 

I see that the double turnstile ⊨ denotes the semantic consequence of some sentence of logic, and single turnstile ⊢ denotes the syntactic consequence of some model. This seems equivalent to me. Why do we need to make this distinction? Are there cases where P⊢Q but P!⊨(does not entail) Q? 

Where is the line drawn between immoral inactivity and a simple lack of action? Under a Kantian framework, inactivity is immoral when it violates a moral obligation you have. This is generally never, since moral obligations are generally negative (i.e. "don't kill someone" is a moral obligation). Kant does posit an ambiguous duty of beneficence, which states that we have a duty to help others. He doesn't say to what extent we have to help others, so it's still unclear if we should vote for Hillary to stop Trump (or vice versa). To be honest, this duty is usually ignored. The main point here, regardless of the duty to help others, is that if Trump or Hillary wins the election, blame can not be placed on any individual who failed to vote. In fact, it's not the voters' fault at all. If Trump does something stupid, only Trump can be blamed. A utilitarian framework provides a clearer bright line. All inactivity, in the exception of one case, is immoral. It is only moral if any action at all would make the situation worse. The thing is, we have to take into account others' actions here, too, unlike under a Kantian framework. So, if we think Obama is a better president than Hillary or Trump, we should abstain from voting so he can remain president, right? Except, other people will vote for Hillary or Trump, rendering our action moot. So, we have to vote for the "least-worst" candidate under this framework. If this interests you, some utilitarian writers include Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. However, while I believe both discuss inactivity, neither of them specifically describe political participation obligations or the lack thereof, which is more dense.
