Recently the following was explained to me by Melanie Wood. (What follows is a summary of some results from her preprint here; see in particular the discussion at the top of page 3.) If $f$ is a primitive irreducible binary $n$-ic form with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$, then we can consider the locus $S_f$ in $\mathbb P^1_{\mathbb Z}$ that $f$ cuts out. This will be finite over $\mathbb Z$, and hence is equal to Spec $R$, where $R = H^0(S_f, \mathcal O)$. The finite $\mathbb Z$-algebra $R$ will be an order in a number field of degree $n$. Not all orders in all number fields arise this way (if $n >3$), but certainly some do! Now it turns out that restriction of $\mathcal O(n-2)$ to $S_f$ (which is an invertible sheaf on $S_f$, and hence gives an ideal class of $R$) is canonically isomorphic to the inverse different of $R$, and hence if $n$ is even then we can consider the restriction to $S_f$ of $\mathcal O((n-2)/2)$, and so obtain a square root of the inverse different of $R$. As is explained in the above linked preprint, $R$ alone does not suffice to determine $f$; rather $f$ is determined by $R$ together with some extra ideal-theoretic strucure. So (as far as I know) this construction of the square root does not depend on $R$ alone, but on extra data. Nevertheless, it gives a very interesting answer to my question in those cases where it applies. 

This is an amplification of Mohan's suggestion to consider the context of projective varieties. I will asume that $k$ is infinite. Given your $k$-algebra $R$, we get Spec $R$ as a variety $V$ in $\mathbb A^d$ for some $d$. We may take the projective closure (i.e. Zariski closure) of $V$ in $\mathbb P^d$ to obtain a projective variety $\overline{V}$. If $V = \mathbb A^d$ there is nothing to say: $R = k[x_1,\ldots,x_d]$ and witnesses its own Noether normalization. So assume that $V$ is a proper subvariety of $\mathbb A^d$, so that $\overline{V}$ is a proper subvariety of $\mathbb P^d$. Because $k$ is infinite, we can (and do) choose a point $P$ (defined over $k$) lying at infinity, and not on $\overline{V}$. We can (and do) also choose a hyperplane $H$ (defined over $k$) which does not contain $P$. We may then apply the projection from $P$ to $H$ to obtain a morphism $\pi: \overline{V} \to H$. Properness of projective morphisms implies that this map has closed image in $H$, say $\overline{W}$. Because $P$ was chosen to lie at infinity, this restricts to a morphism $V \to H \cap \mathbb A^d$, which again has closed image, say $W$. (As the notation suggests, $\overline{W}$ will then be the projective closure of the affine variety $W$.) This map is finite, in the sense that $V \to W$ corresponds to a map $R' \to R$ with $R$ finite over $R'$. Now if $W = H\cap \mathbb A^d$, we have obtained our Noether normalization of $R$, since $R'$ is a polynomial ring in this case. If not, we proceed inductively, replacing $V$ by $W$ and $\mathbb A^d$ by $H\cap \mathbb A^d$ (an affine space of one dimension less). Eventually we will reach a stage where the projection to the hyperplane is surjective. (If $V$ has dimension $n$ then we have to perform $d -n$ projections altogether.) So you see that you have a lot of flexibility in how to achieve the normalization (because at each stage there are a lot of choices of $P$ and $H$), but the choices are not completely arbitrary (because of the condition that $P$ not lie on $\overline{V}$, and that $H$ not contain $P$). For example, thinking this way, you will easily see what goes wrong in Mohan's counterexample. (Taking $a = x$ in his example corresponds to projecting from a point $P$ that does lies on the projective closure of the hyperbola.) 

Chapter 16 of Jacquet--Langlands is about the Jacquet--Langlands correspondence, which concerns the transfer of automorphic forms from quaternion algebras to the group $GL_2$. The modularity of the theta series that you write down is a (very) special case of this correspondence. But probably Langlands more had in mind going the other way, in the following sense: in Chapter 16, Jacquet and Langlands not only show the existence of transfer, they characterize its image. In particular, their results show that the modular form $f$ is in the image of transfer from the definite quaternion algebra $D_{11}$ ramified at $\infty$ and 11. Thus one knows {\em a priori} that there has to be a formula relating $f$ to the $\Theta$-series of some rank four quadratic forms associated to $D_{11}$; it is then a simple matter to compute them precisely (here one uses the fact that $f$ is a Hecke eigenform, and the compatibility of transfer with the Hecke action), and hence obtain the formula $f = (\Theta_P - \Theta_Q)/4.$ The question of characterizing the image of transfer is an automorphic interpretation of what is classically sometimes called the Eichler basis problem: the problem of computing the span of the theta series arising from definite quaternion algebras. The name comes from the fact that the particular case considered here (but with 11 replaced by an arbitrary prime $p$), namely the fact that modular forms of weight two and prime conductor $p$ are spanned by theta series coming from $D_p$, was I think first proved by Eichler in 1955. 

I'm not sure what ingredients you are allowing, but here is one proof sketch: Let $A$ be our f.g. abelian group. Since $\mathbb Z$ is Noetherian, the torsion subgroup $A_{tors}$ is also f.g., and the quotient $A/A_{tors}$ is torsion free, and f.g. (being a quotient of something f.g.). [As pointed out in a comment, we will later show that $A_{tors}$ is a direct summand of $A$, and so the Noetherianess argument is not actually needed.] (1) If $A$ is f.g. and torsion free over $Z$, it is free. Proof: Induction on the dimension of $V := {\mathbb Q}\otimes\_{\mathbb Z} A$ (which is fin. dimensional, since $A$ is f.g.). If this equals $1$, then $A$ is a f.g. subgroup of $\mathbb Q$, and finding a common denominator shows that it is cyclic. (This is the Euclidean algorithm.) In general, choose a line $L$ in $V$. If $A \cap L = 0$, then $A$ embeds into $V/L$, the dimension drops, and we are done by induction. (Of course, this actually can't happen, but never mind; we don't need to prove that here.) Otherwise, we have $0 \rightarrow A\cap L \rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow 0,$ and $B$ embeds into $V/L$, so is free by induction, $A/A\cap L$ is f.g. (by Noetherianess of $\mathbb Z$) and embeds into $L$, so is free by the dim. 1 case. Freeness of $B$ makes this s.e.s split, so $A = A\cap L \oplus B$ is free. (2) In general, $A = A\_{tors} \oplus \text{something free} .$ Proof: We have the s.e.s $0 \rightarrow A_{tors} \rightarrow A \rightarrow A/A_{tors} \rightarrow 0.$ Part (1) shows that $A/A_{tors}$ is free, and then this freeness lets us split the s.e.s. (3) Now suppose $A$ is torsion. Its Sylow subgroups are unique (by abelianess, although there are many other ways to prove this too), and all have mutually trivial intersections, to $A$ is isomorphic to their direct sum. (4) We have now reduced to the case $A$ is a $p$-power order abelian group. Let $p^e$ be the exponent of $A$, so $A$ is a ${\mathbb Z}/p^e {\mathbb Z}$-module. Choose an element $a \in A$ of order $p^e$. Then we have ${\mathbb Z}/p^e {\mathbb Z} \hookrightarrow A,$ an embedding of ${\mathbb Z}/p^e {\mathbb Z}$-modules. Sincer ${\mathbb Z}/p^e$ is injective over itself, this splits. (There are many elementary ways to prove this, or to alter the argument: e.g. apply Pontrjagin duality, which for a group of exponent $p^e$ is just Homs to ${\mathbb Z}/p^e {\mathbb Z},$ to get a surjection from a ${\mathbb Z}/p^e {\mathbb Z}$-module to ${\mathbb Z}/p^e {\mathbb Z}$, which must then split, the latter being free of rank one; now apply Pontrjagin duality again to get a splitting of the original sequence.) Continuing by induction on the order, we write $A$ as a sum of cyclic groups of $p$-power order. (5) We have now shown that any f.g. $A$ is a direct sum of a free group and of cyclic groups of prime power order. It is easy to rearrange this information to get the classification in terms of elementary divisors. Comment: while this may not seem so slick, I think it has the merit that the techniques it uses are elementary versions of standard commutative algebra arguments for analyzing modules over any commutative Noetherian ring, namely various localization and devissage techniques. E.g. the preceding argument extends immediately to the PID case. In step (1), one uses the PID property to find a common denominator, rather than the Euclidean algorithm. In step (3), one observes that $A_{tors}$, being finitely generated and torsion, is annihilated by some non-zero ideal $I$ in the PID $R$, hence is a module over the Artinian ring $R/I$, and so is the sum of its localizations $A\_{\mathfrak p},$ where $\mathfrak p$ ranges over the finitely many (non-zero, hence maximal) prime ideals containing $I$. EDIT: If one wants to work more in the spirit of the classification by elementary divisors, and avoid working one prime at a time, one can combine steps (3), (4), and (5) as follows: (3') Suppose $A$ is f.g. torsion. Let $e$ be its exponent. Then it is a ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$-module, and contains an element of order $e$. Thus one has an embedding ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z} \hookrightarrow A,$ which must split (either by the injectivity argument of (3), applied now to ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$, or the Pontrjagin duality argument). Proceeding by induction, one writes $A = \oplus {\mathbb Z}/e\_i{\mathbb Z},$ where $e_i | e_{i-1},$ as required. EDIT: Suppose that one wants to prove directly that ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$ is injective as a module over itself (as Martin asks below): using a standard criterion for injectivity of modules over a commutative ring, one need just show that for any ideal $I$ of ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$, any map $I \hookrightarrow {\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$ of extends to a map ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$. This is easily done: $I$ is of the form $f {\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$, for some $f | e$. Equivalently, $I = ({\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z})[e/f]$ (the $e/f$-torsion submodule). The given map $I \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$ then necessarily lands in $({\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z})[e/f] = I,$ and a map $I \rightarrow I$ can certainly be extended to a map ${\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Z}/e{\mathbb Z}$, as required. 

$Isom(F,G)$ is indeed an etale sheaf. If we take $F = \mathbb Z/n$ and $G = \mu_n$, then $G$ is a sheaf of $F$-modules, and so evaluation at the global section $1$ gives an isomorphism of sheaves $Hom(\mathbb Z/n,\mu_n) \cong \mu_n$, which identifies $Isom(\mathbb Z/n,\mu_n)$ with the subsheaf of $\mu_n$ whose sections are primitive $n$th roots of unity. Thus there is no global isomorphism precisely because (by assumption) there is no primitive $n$th root of $1$ in $k$. Certainy if we take $l = k[X](X^n - 1)$ we can find a section of the $Isom$ sheaf over Spec $l$, but this section does not descend to a section over Spec $k$, because it does not satisfy the requisite gluing conditions on Spec $l \times$ Spec $l =$ Spec $l\otimes_k l$. (These gluing conditions amount to the Galois invariance that Tom Goodwillie refers to in his comment above.) Perhaps the source of your confusion is that if $V$ is an open set of a topological space, then $V \cap V = V$, but in the etale site (in which generality intersection is replaced by fibre product), $V\times V$ is typically quite a bit larger than $V$. 

Just to augment Kevin's series of comments: I think that the conductor of the induction of some character $\chi$ over a quadratic field to $\mathbb Q$ would normally equal $D N(C)^2$, where $D$ is the discriminant of the quadratic field, $C$ is the condutor of the character (an ideal in the quadratic field) and $N$ is the norm from the quadratic field to $\mathbb Q$. E.g. in Kevin's $23$ example, one inducing a character of conductor 1 from $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-23})$, so the conductor is $23$. [Added in response to an edit in the question: This form has nebentypus equal to the Legendre symbol mod 23.] In the Maass case one should be able to do something similar, by e.g. choosing a prime $p \equiv 1 mod 4$ such that $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{p})$ has non-trivial class group, and then inducing a non-trivial character of conductor 1. [Added in response to an edit in the question: Such examples will have nebentypus equal to the Legendre symbol mod p, I think.] [Added in response to an edit in the question:] Based on the formula above for the conductor, I think that to have square free conductor one will need to induce a character with trivial conductor, i.e. coming from the (strict) class group. I think that such an induction will always have non-trivial nebentypus, though. (The key point being that if $H/{\mathbb Q}$ is the stict Hilbert class field of the real quadratic field, then this is a generalized dihedral extension.) Another argument, pointed out me by a colleague, is that if the conductor is square fee and the nebentypus is trivial, then all the local factors of the automorphic representation at primes in the conductor are Steinberg, which is not possible for the induction of a character. [One more remark:] It seems to me that if we replace $\mathbb Q$ by some well-chosen number field $F$, then it will be possible to find an unramified quadratic extension $E$ of $F$ such that $E$ in turn admits a degree $4$ extension $K$, everywhere unramified, so that $K$ over $F$ (a degree 8 extension) is Galois with the quaternion group as Galois group (as opposed to a dihedral group). I think if we then take the corresponding order 4 ideal class character of $E$ and induce it to $F$, we get a monomial representation of $F$ with trivial determinant whose conductor is equal to one (and in particular, is square-free). In other words, one is a little bit "lucky" in the $\mathbb Q$-case that Hilbert class fields of real quadratic fields are dihedral over $\mathbb Q$. 

Here is another way to look at it; it is a more explicit variant of Sandor's answer: If you look at the family of (proper transforms of) lines passing through each of the two points you blew up, you can see directly that you get two rulings, the members of one crossing the members of the other transversally in exactly one point. This will let you construct an explicit isomorphism with $\mathbb P^1\times \mathbb P^1$. 

I believe that the question is still slightly mis-stated; see my comment above. (I'm sorry if I've blundered here, but will be set straight if I have, I'm sure!) To make your question more concrete, one should take $X$ to be an elliptic curve, $r = 1$, and then $Ch(X/F)_0 = E(F)$. So your question becomes, why does $E(F)$ achieve large rank over various extensions. You discussed this in your question, but I don't your discussion fully describes the situation. There is work of many people, especially Mazur and Rubin (as well as the others you mention) showing that Selmer groups grow in something like the expected way as you enlarge $F$ appropriately. The reason I single out Mazur and Rubin is that they work in a very general context, but they only deal with Selmer groups. One expects that the Mordell--Weil groups grow in the same manner (since one expects Sha to be finite), but this is not known, and no-one knows how to exihibit any points on elliptic curves by theoretical means, other than via Heegner points constructions. Given this, I think the answer to the higher codimension question will be similar: no-one knows how to make cycles (other than Heegner cycles in certain special contexts). If you replaced the Chow group by some Galois-cohomological stand-in (i.e. some kind of Selmer group), perhaps one could then say something. I don't know of work of that kind, but it may well exist. 

In calculus we teach that if $x = x_0 + \Delta x,$ then $f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0) \Delta x.$ In other words, the derivative of $f$ at $x_0$ tells us the scaling factor for the change in $f$ when $x_0$ moves by an infinitesimal amount $\Delta x$. What does infinitesimal mean? Well, we are ignoring higher order terms, i.e. terms in $\Delta x^n$ for $n \geq 2,$ i.e. we are working not at the level $\Delta x =0$, which says $x = x_0$, i.e. that we are on the diagonal, but at the next level $\Delta x^2 = 0,$ which is working modulo $I^2$. (Working modulo $I$ is the same as setting $\Delta x = 0$.) This is written in one variable, but works for any number of variables. 

This is an answer to the question about the general structure of the centre of the enveloping algebra: The centre of the enveloping algebra (in particular when $\mathfrak g$ is reductive) is one of the basic objects in the study of infinite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras and Lie groups. It was first described in general (for reductive $\mathfrak g$) by Harish-Chandra, as far as I know, who proved the following: let $\mathfrak g$ be a reductive Lie algebra (over $\mathbb C$, say) and let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra. Let $W$ be the Weyl group, which acts on $\mathfrak h$ via the adjoint action. Then there is an isomorphism $Z(\mathfrak g) \cong Sym(\mathfrak h)^W.$ (Here $Z(\mathfrak g)$ denotes the centre of the enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak g)$, and $Sym(\mathfrak h)$ denotes the symmetric algebra of $\mathfrak h,$ which is the same as the enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak h)$, since $\mathfrak h$ is abelian.) E.g. if $\mathfrak g = {\mathfrak sl}_2$, then a Cartan subalgebra is one-dimensional, therefore $Sym(\mathfrak h)^W$ turns out to be a polynomial ring in one generator, where this generator can be taken to be the Casimir. If $\mathfrak g$ is semi-simple of rank $l$, then the centre turns out to be a polynomial ring in $l$ generators, one of which is the Casimir, and the others of which can be taken to be the so-called higher Casimirs. (Their degrees are the so-called exponents of $\mathfrak g$, or perhaps the exponents shifted by one; I'm unsure about the standard normalization. [Added: As Mike Skirvin confirms in a comment below, they are the exponents shifted by $1$.]) To learn more you can google Harish-Chandra isomorphism, or look in one of the many representation-theory texts that are out there. (I like Knapp's book Representation Theory of Semisimple Groups: An Overview Based on Examples, but there are lots of choices.)
