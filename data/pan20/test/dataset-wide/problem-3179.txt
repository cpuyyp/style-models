Personally, I always hate it when a TV or movie producer takes some famous book and makes major changes to it, like adding a totally new character. Like hey, if you didn't like the story, write your own. Don't put your words in someone else's mouth just so you can piggyback on his popularity. Thee was certainly no such character in the original Robin Hood story. Whether this really is or will become a "staple of the mythology", we'll see I guess. But that little rant aside ... To make a Muslim character living in England plausible, you don't have to suppose any large community of Muslims establishing a permanent residency in England. You just have to posit that ONE person could have made it there. And that seems pretty obviously possible. Others have noted that Muslims did visit England and trade with England in this period. You just have to suppose that among the hundreds? thousands? of Muslims who visited, one decide to hang around and join this particular group. 

Alex has given a good general answer. Let me add a detail: The ancient Jews had a simple system for mass-producing copies of Scripture: Get a room-full of scribes. One stands in front with the book to be copied. The rest sit at desks with blank paper. The guy at the front reads slowly, while the rest write down what he says. Then they had various schemes to check that a copy was accurate. Like always write the same number of letters per line. Then when you get to the end, if the original ends on, say, page 32, line 20, and that line has 15 letters, then if your copy does not end on page 32, line 20, with 15 letters, you must have added or dropped letters somewhere. They'd also spot check places in the middle. I'm not sure if this technique was used for books other than Hebrew Scripture, but it seems obvious enough that it could have been. Of course this assumes there's a large enough demand for copies to justify getting a bunch of people. 

After the Independence War, the US was not capable of invading or colonizing other countries due to the lack of leadership and resources (it was not as powerful as other European nations). Throughout the middle of the 19th century especially after slavery abolition (note that the slave trading and cheap labor provided by slaves were two of the biggest contributors to the U.S. economy), the U.S. had to find another way to increase its trade. After China's borders were forced to open, it was a golden opportunity for the U.S. that it could never miss. 

Until Japan made a strategically foolish decision to attack Hawaii which invited the US into the war, Japan was winning the war in China (Manchuria) and other South East Asian countries. The SU was very weak in the east at the time without much naval power. There was no reason for Japan to be afraid of Soviet invasion. Japan defeated Russia in Russo-Japanese war in 1905 and the main reasons for Russia's defeat were weak Russian naval power and Russia's internal political situation. Japan had confidence in its military power in World War II, too much of which led to its defeat and surrender. 

Even though other countries in East Asia were either opened or colonized by European nations (except for a few including Korea), Japan was one of the few countries (including Korea) that have never been opened by European countries. Japan was strategically very important to the US as it was the geographically closest to the US and it still remained closed without much influence by Western countries. The US had to force Japan to open up its border so that it could take a strategic position and use Japan's land and resources to improve its trade and economy. From Japan's perspective, Japan watched what happened in China and it could not risk weakening itself as China did through the wars. Japan needed Western technology and weaponry to defend itself. That's why Japan had to take the offer made by the US. Conclusion: 

At least some ancient Greeks accepted homosexuality. Thebes and Sparta are both reported to have military units made up of homosexual couples, the reasoning basically being that this would inspire them to fight harder to protect their lovers. Some sources say that Sparta considered homosexuality superior to heterosexuality because they believed women were inferior to men and thus not worthy of true love -- a woman was only good for reproduction. For the most part Greek homosexuality appears to have been pedophilia, at least, they routinely talked about the older man as the "lover" and the younger as the "beloved", though I don't know what the upper limit on the age of the beloved was. Plato quotes Socrates as saying that when he was a boy he was proud of his abilities to seduce older men. Homosexuality was certainly known and practiced by the Romans, but it was widely condemned. Or at least, the surviving history books were written by people who condemned it. But for example, according to Plutarch, when Julius Caesar was a young man, he was appointed ambassador to Illyria, and had a homosexual affair with the king of Illyria. But Plutarch says this brought widespread criticism, opponents taunting him as the "Queen of Illyria" and the like. According to the Bible, Sodom and Gomorroh accepted homosexuality. I don't know of any other ancient cultures who accepted it. Of course that doesn't prove there were no others: I don't claim to know all about every culture that ever existed. 

Because they needed Japan as a trading base and gateway to China, India and other countries such as the Philippines. Japan was one of the few countries that have not been technically colonized in East Asia. Its strategic importance was too great to be overlooked by any country, especially the U.S. 

Of course not. They have their own names such as AK-74, AK-103, AK-105, etc. and the latest version is AK-12. Why would people call AK-12 AK-47 which is far more outdated than AK-12? 'AK' stands for 'Automatic Kalashinikov' and 'Mikhail Kalashinikov' was the Russian general who designed the rifle. According to the production history of the linked Wikipedia page on AK-47, AK-47 is still being produced. 

Strong European countries such as Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia and other countries were expanding rapidly in the uncharted territories such as Africa, India, China, the Philippines, and Japan because they need to increase their trade and plunder natural resources from weak nations. The US was a late comer to this ever-intensifying competition and East Asian countries (China, the Philippines and Japan) were the only territories left for the US to compete with other European nations. China, through two Opium Wars, was weakened significantly and had to accept Western countries' power and influence, which led to the collapse of the Qing Dynasty. 

Arnold Schwarzenegger is a native German speaker from Austria and a naturalized US citizen who became Governor of California. Wikipedia indicates that his grasp of English was quite weak in childhood. Schwarzenegger himself indicated that his command of English was weak in 1968. In 1968 he was 20 or 21 years old, indicating that his mastery of English came as an adult. Martin Van Buren, the eighth president of the United States, was a native speaker of Dutch and learned English later. This case might not fit your requirements as he was a native-born US citizen from New York. 

In Adomnán of Iona's Life of St. Columba (Book 2, Chapter 39), the author speaks of a man from Derry who swore an oath of slavery to a man who saved him from the death penalty. He later ran away and ended up in Scotland, where he met St. Columba. The man, named Librán of the reed-bed, explains his his back-story thus: 

Exploration of the Gobekli Tepe archaeological site in Turkey from the 1960's to the 1990's revealed that monumental construction predates the development of agriculture, rather than the other way around (which was the previously prevailing viewpoint). 

On September 20, 1979, the US signed a treaty with Kiribati abandoning its claims on several islands ("Canton (Kanton), Enderbury, Hull (Orona), Birnie, Gardner (Nikumaroro), Phoenix (Rawaki), Sydney (Manra), McKean, Christmas (Kiritimati), Caroline, Starbuck, Malden, Flint, and Vostok"). It appears that sovereignty over the islands was disputed, but the treaty clearly had a similar effect to an outright gift of undisputed territory. It also is pretty clear that the USA could have retained the islands by force if it had wanted to, so this wasn't a case of surrendering territory under serious threat of conquest. 

To the best of my knowledge, there are no surviving records outside the Bible that can be linked to the time of Solomon. There are surviving mentions from the records of other nations to King David, and to some of the kings who reigned after Solomon, but not to Solomon. (Not shocking in itself -- lots of people in ancient times are known to us from only one or two sources.) It's instructive but not definitive to examine the Mosaic Law. I was surprised when I checked on this to find that the Mosaic law does not have any clear prohibition of prostitution. Deuteronomy 23:17 bans cult prostitutes, but not prostitutes in general. Deuteronomy 22:21 says that if a man marries and discovers that his bride was not a virgin, she can be executed. But if a prostitute never tries to marry ... there's no clear law against it. It was certainly condemned as horribly immoral. It makes me wonder if it was like pornography or alcohol abuse in the U.S. today: widely condemned, but not illegal. I say it's not definitive because just because something was written in the law 430 years before doesn't prove the law was still enforced or even thought about. Or new laws may have been written. So I think the answer is: no one knows. I'm happy to hear if anyone has information I'm not familiar with.
