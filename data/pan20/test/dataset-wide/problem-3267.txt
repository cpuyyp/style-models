This source states it occured in 1193. the source for that source is $URL$ which goes into great detail on the damage. An excerpt: 

Who was the first US police officer killed in the line of duty? When and where did it take place? By US police officer, I mean any active-duty police officer working for any force in the US post-constitution. 

However, there are various reasons how so many came to be depicting lions in general (besides what you stated). For example, the lion in the Netherlands coat of arms is from the Dutch Republic Lion. The Dutch Republic Lion came from the Duchy of Brabant coat of arms. The Lion on the Duchy of Brabant coat of arms is now also present on the coat of arms of Belgium. This is one example of two or more coats of arms (or parts of coats of arms) coming from one source. To sum it up, many of the lions you showed just aren't the same. Lions in different attitudes are seen as distinctly different lions. However, in some cases, they came from a common source. Because the lion was seen as the king of the beasts since the Stone Age, at least, it was a common charge (or supporter). Thus, the fact that two coat of arms have lions on them does not necessarily mean both came from the same source (although it could). 

The Romans named the days of the month by counting down to kalends, ides and nones. We use numbers counting up from one for the first day of the month. When did this change take place? I assume that it was gradual, with people using the modern system when it was the more convenient, but I can find no information about who did it, nor when it happened, except a vague reference to the Roman system being in use until the Renaissance. 

Counting as we know it, including zero as a number, was brought to the traders and merchants of Europe by Leonardo of Pisa (whom we now know as Fibonacci) by his book "Liber Abbaci" in 1202. This system was already used by academics for mathematics, but was not known to the majority of the population. (ref: "The man of Numbers" by Keith Devlin, ISBN 978-1-4088-2248-7) My question is how did common people here in Britain count before that, for instance the year, day of month, hour of day: how were they counted, if at all? 

This depends on many conditions (especially the type of gun), but I will outline a few of the main ones here. Vickers Machine Gun (1912) 

Have the gospels been preserved accurately? The Gospels are commonly thought to be written in this order: 

If there were five-hundred plus Christians (brothers and sisters), there definitely would have been more people opposed to Christianity living at the time. It's highly unlikely that all of these hundreds (likely thousands) of people would have died in the next ten years leaving only the Gospel writers. 

So, yes, there was involvement from South and Central America, but it did not play an instrumental part in either of the World Wars. 

The text also states that the arms were moved with chains. However, some of these details (especially the part about the arms) is considered to be made up by Flaubert. The part about the wings is likely made up also. This account should be taken with a grain of salt. For example, according to the Republic, it was bronze. According to Jewish texts (c. 12c. AD), it was made of brass. Another Greek wrote: 

I have read that New year's day was fixed at Lady Day 25th March from 1155 until the reform in 1752, but I can't find out who fixed it and why, can anybody help? Responding to the comment by C.G. Campbell, I've forgotten where I read it, sorry, but that's not really relevant -- it doesn't matter if I got the date wrong. In 1750 the New year was officially Lady Day, so it must have been set sometime, so my question is still when and by whom? 

My question embraces history, cosmology and astronomy, I hope this is an appropriate forum to ask it, if not I apologise and hope to be re-directed. I have read, but lost the reference, that when the remnant of Magellan's expedition returned in September 1522, their log showed a date the day before that of the inhabitants of the port where they landed. This is important evidence that the Earth orbits the Sun, but it is not mentioned in any reference to the voyage that I can find. Please, does anyone have more details, and where I can find out more about it? 

He cites Description de l'Egypte IX, 468, which is in French. Description de l'Ã‰gypte is a "series of publications, appearing first in 1809 and continuing until the final volume appeared in 1829, which offered a comprehensive scientific description of ancient and modern Egypt as well as its natural history." If someone who can read French could provide a translation of the respective passage from the book, that would be great. 

They don't all seem to be the same lion. Spain and Denmark's lions aren't even yellow. This is another rendering of the Coat of Arms of Sweden: 

There are a few flaws in this conclusion. First of all, the text in all caps is just wrong. The church had the New Testament from the time it was written. Quoting Wiki here, 

I'm going to analyze the text itself rather than the events here (this is History SE, not Christianity SE). (Fredsbend has written a good answer about other aspects) 

Ba'al is a Northwest Semitic title applied to many gods of the region. The one I believe you are referring to is Moloch. Here is a exaggerated description of him by Gustave Flaubert, written in 1862. Although it is is not first-hand, he did visit Carthage to research and gather material for it. 

I was seduced by the simplicity of Cominterm's comment/answer, but what happened when they got to "ten", and "eleven" and "twenty" and "one hundred" without knowing about a zero digit? Regarding the "put on hold" this is not a trivial question that can be answered fairly easily -- I spent a lot of time trying to find out before I posted it here, and surely it comes well within "Cultures and historical practices" as listed in "What topics can I ask about here?" I am interested in the evolution from Roman numerals to Indo/Arabic, particularly in how people described dates, especially days of the month.

My answer is that this is just a dramatization with little to no research done by the producing team. The tradition of playing the winning team's national anthem was not begun until the 1932 Olympics (a common misconception is that the tradition started at the 1924 Olympics). So, in other words, it is impossible that the Star Spangled Banner was played at the 1896 Olympics. The only anthem played at the 1896 Olympics was the Greek anthem (because they were the host country). The Olympic anthem wasn't used until the 1960 games. So, to sum it up, TV is very unreliable and should be used when seeking drama, not fact. Sources: 

To sum it up, about seventy pounds has always been considered a decent load range, but the average infantryman can carry more. However, during battle, when troops need to move faster, it is common to lessen the required load. Sources 

I've tried to cover the major attempts here, but there were many other attempts that I did not list. 

Yes, both World War I and World War II involved South and Central America. WWI Here is a list of South American countries that severed relations and those that declared war. Sourced from here.
