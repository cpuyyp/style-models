They aren't really interview caliber but I wear DZR GMT-8's to work everyday. They work nicely for a laid back business casual. DZR has 3 other models if the GMT-8's aren't your style. You could also try Chrome's Kurk-Pro, but those are even less office appropriate. I think the main reason that companies don't make them is that they don't see a big market. I hope this changes as more people decide to bike-commute to work. DZR GMT-8s: $URL$ Chrome Kursk-Pro: $URL$ Here is a picture of a custom job on some dress shoes: $URL$ 

I use many of the same techniques that @M.Werner recommends. Get a general fit and then tweak as needed. Generally I will take a guess at where things should be and then climb on. It is usually obvious when I'm way wrong. For a little fine tuning I will balance with a counter top or the like and then pedal backwards for a bit, obviously doesn't work with FG, hopping off and making tweaks. The final tweaks I make come from riding around noting changes to make and then when I take a break or am ready to turn around I make adjustments. I find I get a better idea for how well honed my setup is by actually riding than by measurements. 

8 km is about my daily commute one way, and it is known to rain here in the Pacific Northwest of the United States from time to time. I wear my work clothes when I ride, but my commute isn't very strenuous. One very modest hill in the morning to work, and a bit more challenging hill in the afternoon from work. I'll usually wear shorts until late October or early November, and working in IT I can get by with fairly casual attire. For the rain, I have rainpants. As others have said, even the best quick drying shorts are going to take a while to dry if they are wet. If it's only misting outside, I don't put on the rainpants. A little light moisture on the surface of even cotton blend shorts will dry fast. 

Yes, that's the tricky part. I obtained a thin plastic tube (about 1mm diameter), and bent it to form a sort of archway above the computer. I threaded a flexible wire (naked wire used for fastening, not electrical wire) through the tube. This wire provided stability to the arch, and its ends were wrapped around the handlebar left and right of the computer, to fix the "archway" in place. I cut a small hole in the side of the plastic tube, and threaded the two electrical cables into the tube, one from each sides, so they came out at the hole. Then I soldered the LED to the two cables. Finally I gently pushed the legs of the LED into the hole (one to go left, one right, following their respective cable), so the LED sat in the hole. I finally fixed the arch to the handle bar using the wire ends. The result looked like this: 

Dead animals on the road in the dark are my primary concern, but mileage varies. Dogs, snakes, and deer are the most common ones I see. Dogs are most concerning as they will sometimes give chase. I've read that dogs can determine an intersect point between a moving object and them, but they cannot adjust very well to something which suddenly alters it's speed. The advice I've read, if chased by a dog, is to maintain a speed, and then accelerate when the dog and the cyclist are about to make contact. The cyclist will be just outside the dogs reach, and the dog won't be able to adjust. Snakes around here are mostly harmless and small, but I prefer not to kill living things if I can avoid it. In other areas, there are any number of venomous snakes, and riding one over is a good way to encourage a snake to strike one. Deer are disconcerting because they really aren't afraid of cyclists and seem not to understand what I am. I have seen video and read accounts of deer striking and mountain lions attacking cyclists and knocking them off their ride. Any large animal could easily knock one over and cause harm. Predatory ones, especially big cats, could prove the most dangerous as a cyclist tends to resemble fleeing prey. 

Personally I use Google Maps with the bicycle directions option, but I am usually looking for commuting routes not exercise routes. 

I use compression clothing because they are usually better at wicking away sweat and keeping me dry and cool (remember cotton kills). I also like that because they are tight fitting I don't have to worry about them getting caught in my bike, I have had shorts catch on different parts of my frame before. Another plus is that I think I look pretty good in compression clothing. Bike shorts with a bit of pad are awesome! But as far as fatigue I don't have any information. I think the prevailing theory is that compressed muscles will be less fatigued, but I have my doubts with that theory. 

While there are jeans specifically for cycling (see Tom77's answer), they are still a compromise (and can be expensive). I found the best option for longer rides (> 2 km or so) is to change trousers. That way you can wear bike trousers when biking, and nice trousers when you want to look nice. This also avoids problems when you get dirty or wet during the ride, and lets you adapt your bike trousers to the weather (insulated in the winter, shorts in summer). At most destinations, there is a washroom where you can slip in to quickly change trousers; I did this for years every day before and after work. If that is not practical, you can get slightly bigger cycling trousers and wear them over your regular trousers, so you can put them on and take them off without any indecent exposure. Or just change trousers in a quiet corner...

There is likely much more variability at the point where the seatpost and frame meet as compared to the point where the seatpost and seat meet. $URL$ 

It's likely the cable and not the shifter. I have Shimano Rapidfire shifters, and I've dropped my commuter bike a few times--both with and without me. More than once I thought I had a shifter problem, but when the LBS looked at it the problem was the cable. Cables take a real beating with an index shifter as opposed to a friction shifter. Being a year round commuter, I have my shifter cables replaced every two years. It is sometimes said that if you talk to three different bike mechanics about anything that you are likely to get at least four answers. However, in talking with mechanics, I've found they tend to bet on the cable as the problem. 

No, you most likely did not. Bicycle chains are very strong (and chains on children's bicycles are usually similar to chains on adult bicycles). Plus, if a chain is really overloaded, the links will separate (i.e. the chain will tear) before the force is great enough to actually stretch the chain material (which is usually hardened steel). Note that bicycle chains do get longer due to wear on the material. This is often referred to as "stretch", but that is misleading - the chain does not lenghten due to being pulled, like a rubber band, but because the friction in the links wears down the material. So something else must have happened to make the chain sag. The most likely explanation is that the back wheel was pulled out of its dropouts, as indicated in BillSkiCO's answer. It is also possible that the chain was already sagging before, you just did not notice. On bicycles without a derailleur, chains can sag quite a bit without causing problems.
