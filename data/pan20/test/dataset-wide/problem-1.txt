There are useful things that Mars can provide, but none of them are really dependent on a colony belonging to Earth. If humanity continues to grow, we'll eventually start running out of room on Earth. Living space on Earth could become so expensive that moving to Mars is actually reasonable. This would work best if there is already a colony on Mars, but it doesn't really matter if that colony belongs to a particular Earth country or corporation or not. Another possibility is inventions. I've already mentioned some of the difficulties I can foresee a Martian colony needing to overcome. In particular with hydrocarbons, there will be quite a bit of interest in developing new strategies to process waste biomatter into useful hydrocarbons. These new techniques could prove quite useful on Earth as well. However, none of these things require being on Mars, just going there. The US space program has resulted in quite a few useful inventions (such as velcro), but they have been a result of solving the problems of going to space rather than some product of being there. Similarly, I believe that going to Mars or other planets will result in a number of very useful inventions, but none of them will actually require anything from the other planets. 

Backstory: One unfortunate day in a parallel universe at a lab, an accident causes a massive explosion that blows a janitor (working there part time while going to college) out of his world. His anchor to the space-time of his universe is (painfully) severed, and he lands somewhere in USA. His arrival is also accompanied by an explosion, though unlike at his departure it is merely big enough to be easily noticed. Nobody else is injured by that explosion, but he is found, severely wounded and in a coma, and taken to a hospital. Even though the wounds should have been easily fatal, he survives with little assistance. After a month, he finally wakes up. While he was unconscious, the government realized that nobody knew who he was—he didn't match the description of anyone missing, he didn't match with any known records of people, and even other governments failed to determine who he is. When he wakes up, the wild theories of him coming from another world gain credibility when they find he speaks a completely unknown language. It doesn't take him too long to learn enough English to communicate—he is quite intelligent and his memory was significantly improved by the accident. He is also able to figure out that he's no longer on the same planet by seeing a globe and noticing that the continents are not what he is used to. Unfortunately, being a janitor, he has no clue how the explosion transferred him to another world. By this point he's become somewhat of a celebrity. He is proof that parallel universes exist and that travel between is possible. Everyone knows who he is. With no way home, he tries to adjust to life here. He is given a scholarship to go to college to study physics, where he hopes that he might be able to figure out how to get home. After graduating, he works in a government lab and continues working on ways to go to, or even just contact, parallel worlds. After a decade or so (and no luck getting home), he realizes the final result of what the accident did to him—he's not getting older. Question: So now the government has access to someone who recently became immortal. They have no means of replicating the process by which he became immortal, so he's the only one they'll ever have. He has an excellent memory that hasn't been (and won't be) diminished by time, and he is very hardy. What would be the best way (for the near future) for the government to utilize someone who is immortal? For example, if the Earth was going to be destroyed and a generation ship was sent out as humanity's last chance, he would be great to have along because he would not forget the purpose of the generation ship. 

(late edit - I feel like I didn't do a good job of tying my answer back to the original question) If this is a part of your universe, you don't have to explain how brains only work if they have a spirit inhabiting the body - it should be sufficient to declare that this is the case. The biggest impact I see this having in society is a significant reduction in atheism in the sense of people who believe there is nothing after death. However, I would expect such a world to still have a large number of people who do not believe in God and/or follow any particular religion - the existence of some form of spirits does not prove the existence of God, and certainly does not prove any one particular religion true. This would also have an impact for the development of and discussion around artificial intelligence - if it's known that true intelligence requires a spirit, there would be much less fear of an AI becoming far more intelligent than people and taking over, unless someone figured out how to give an AI a soul, which of course someone would be trying to do. 

Let's take a look at what we're actually dealing with here. I assume your intent is that you want to get projectiles going at relativistic speeds. If you look at the formula for relativistic kinetic energy it's pretty easy to derive that going at $\sqrt{0.75}c$ means having as much kinetic energy as you do rest mass energy - in other words, for a 10 gram projectile to get moving at about 0.866c you need to convert 10 grams of propellant into kinetic energy for the projectile with 100% efficiency (not possible due to the second law of thermodynamics), or convert something like 100 grams of propellant with 10% efficiency. Let's assume you have 5-gram bullets, and you can get about 50% efficiency from your propellant (this is stretching believability, though). So you need a way to convert about 10 grams of mass into energy very quickly. Antimatter. The colonists are using antimatter. Here's a Wikipedia link I really like - Order of magnitude (energy). If you look at this chart at the $10^{14}$ row you'll see "Energy released by annihilation of 1 gram of antimatter and matter". Now look up at the $10^{13}$ row and notice this entry - "Yield of the Little Boy atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II". 1 gram of antimatter and matter is about 3x the energy yield of Little Boy, so the 10 grams you need for a relativistic projectile gives you about 30x that energy yield. 

The radiation is your only real problem in space. So with a nice radiation-proof spacesuit, you could survive a nuclear blast at a ridiculously close range. So how far would you have to be in order to be safe from radiation, assuming essentially no radiation protection from your spacesuit? According to Wikipedia, a dose of 0.1 grays (10 rads) is enough to cause radiation sickness. Let's look at one of the charts NASA included: 

Our bodies are really good at recognizing anything foreign in them. In order to evade our immune system, bacteria (and viruses) need to have evolved mechanisms specifically to do so. The serious plagues through history have been diseases that already are or have become adapted to people encountering a new group of people that haven't encountered the disease before. It would actually be more accurate to assume that the microorganisms we encounter will have no defense against us. Second, most bacterial infections aren't trying to kill you - they want to survive and reproduce, and that is done better by not killing their host. The ones that are really successful are those that actually benefit their host - you have a microcosm of bacteria in your gut that aids in digestion and keeping you healthy. Related to that, in addition to your immune system alien bacteria also has to deal with the bacteria already in your body. Being already adapted to living in our bodies, our helpful bacteria would almost certainly out-compete non-adapted alien bacteria. 

I think that you can explain a lot with one central idea: The nanites try to keep people alive Thanks to the nuclear apocalypse, billions were exposed to massive doses of radiation. Without the nanites, they would have all died of radiation sickness. The nanites did their best to keep people from dying, but the radiation damage was just too much for them to fully repair. They were able to prevent many deaths, but the amount of DNA damage left the survivors barely recognizable as humans. For a few generations their DNA was still very unstable and led to extremely high mortality rates, but with the help of the nanites enough were able to survive to lead to a generation with more stable DNA. By this point they are no longer human - they are the demons. The variations are due to not everyone's DNA being damaged in the same way, leading to the nanites attempting different strategies to repair them. One strategy could have been to include the DNA of nearby animals - a person who has bird DNA grafted in could be the ancestor of some of the winged demons. In addition, by the time their DNA stabilized the nanites became integrated into the demons. This is how they can survive with otherwise implausible body structures, and also why they have unusual abilities. It can also have affected their reproduction rate, allowing you to make them however common or rare you want. The survivors also have the nanites helping them stay alive, leading to them healing faster and being more durable. This means that your unrealistic RP can have a somewhat realistic explanation - in real life it would take you quite a while to heal from being shot or stabbed with a sword, but thanks to the nanites a good night's rest goes a long way to helping you fully heal. As a side note, this also gives you a way to have an interesting and powerful "magic" curse - commanding the nanites to abandon someone/something. It would cause them to lose all their nanite enhancements, including rapid healing and increased durability. The Genesis Bomb The members of the moon colony aren't aware of the extent to which the nanites are keeping everything running, and the ways in which the nanites have updated themselves to the current situation. This is why the genesis bomb does not behave as expected. At ground zero, the nanites detect the surge of energy but misinterpret it as another nuclear apocalypse in the making. So they quickly abandon their hosts, leaving them to die, and absorb as much of the energy as they can to render it harmless. Thanks to their misunderstanding of the nature of the energy much of the energy still escapes to terraform the rest of the world. The nanites at ground zero eventually realize the energy is of a different nature than expected, and dump it into a single life form - a tree. Filled with enormous amounts of genesis energy, the tree grows into Yggdrasil. Away from ground zero, the nanites do not abandon their hosts, but attempt to do what they did during the nuclear apocalypse - keep everyone alive. This causes further changes to the life forms, but thanks to the energy being inherently creative (whereas nuclear radiation is destructive) there is not the same massive die-off that there was following the nuclear apocalypse. The unusual changes to the geography of the earth come about because of the interference of the nanites. Their absorbing and redirecting of the genesis energy caused it to behave in ways that the moon colonists could not have predicted. An option: You could have the genesis bomb be the reason why the demon's DNA stabilized - if not for the genesis bomb they eventually would have died off, but the nanites somehow utilized the genesis energy to stabilize the DNA. 

A person and their dup are two different people. There would be a lot of complications with this, particularly in developed countries. For example, you would not be allowed to work for one company while your dup works for a competitor. A person and their dup are a single person. In some places this will include things like working limits - if the previous limit was a 40-hour work week, the new limit is still 40 hours, but is now combined for you and your dup. A person and their dup are one person with two bodies. I think this is what will effectively be the case in most places because it is the most flexible. This allows for laws to be updated sensibly - a work limit could be 40 hours per body. 

Gravity is not caused by the Earth's spin. If you're near the equator, the spin of the Earth does counteract the force of gravity a little bit, but only by about 0.3%. So gravitationally, nothing would really be affected by the Earth spinning in the opposite direction. If the Earth starting orbiting the sun in the opposite direction, the biggest change would be that the seasons would go in the opposite order: Winter to Fall to Summer to Spring. Of course, if you're in the middle of Winter or Summer when this happens, you're not going to notice anything. If you're in Spring or Fall when this happens, you'll definitely notice when Spring changes back into Winter or Fall changes back into Summer. As for the global climate, here's an article that explores that a little bit. The short version is that the directions of trade winds would change, causing different effects in different areas. So places that are now habitable would become less and less habitable, while other areas would become more habitable. 

Your family is starving: If you don't have enough to eat, you don't feel safe or stable even if the land you are living in is otherwise a utopia. You are going to go to desperate measures to find food. If other people have food and you don't, you're going to try to steal food or something that can be used to obtain food. There is a lot risk in doing this, but if it's literally do or die... You have been cast out by society: Hundreds of years ago, exile would have been more harsh than a death sentence. You no longer have anyone helping you if you are sick or injured. It would be difficult to get any other village to accept you. Setting up a farm on your own would be very difficult, and because you're an exile it makes it much easier for others to find you and punish you again for whatever caused you to be exiled. The rule of law is broken: If the law is being ignored or is twisted in favor of those in power, you don't feel the safety and stability the law is supposed to provide. This is where Robin Hood figures and rebel groups fall. These people generally want to follow good laws, and feel that in order for that to be possible they need to cause massive changes to happen. Peer pressure: If your friends are members of a gang, you'll feel social pressure to be affiliated with that gang. You might actually be press-ganged into joining the gang. This could happen with a bandit group, too, whether they are recruiting or outright kidnapping. 

I'd suggest that he go get something to eat. No, really. If he goes into a restaurant and orders something to eat, the army's not going to attack him - there are civilians in there! If he's not being aggressive while he's in there, they're going to send someone in there to try to talk to him. It might help if he started talking to some of the people in there to show that he's willing to chat. Also, he should avoid the appearance of taking hostages or using human shields. One way to do that would be to make sure that he is in a place where people are frequently entering and leaving. This also has the benefit of providing more character witnesses for him - "No officer, he wasn't killing anyone. He seemed to be enjoying a cup of hot chocolate." Part of the reason why this would work is that it immediately removes him from the context of an aggressive situation (he's damaging their fancy toys) and into a social one (many people like to chat while they eat). Another part of why it works is that it is unexpected - the military would be expecting him to continue to attack and destroy more vehicles and ships, so doing something else should cause them to re-evaluate the situation. What if the military attacks him anyway while he's in the middle of a bunch of civilians? This demonstrates that the military does not value the lives of their own people and that they're quite incompetent. He's already demonstrated that he is far more powerful than them, so if they aren't going to take the opportunity to talk with him it makes for a strong argument that that military deserves to be dismantled.
