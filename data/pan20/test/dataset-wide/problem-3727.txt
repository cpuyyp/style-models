If $L/K$ is abelian and $K/k$ cyclic, then $L/k$ is going to be normal if the Galois group at the gottom acts on the class group attached to $L/K$ via class field theory, and it will be abelian if action fixes the classes. This is due to Hasse and follows easily from the standard results in class field theory. This is Prop. 1.2.8 in my survey on class field towers (I apologize for the outdated content. All of this needs to be rewritten). There are similar constructions in Kummer theory going back to Kummer; this can be used in several proofs of the Kronecker-Weber theorem and should be e.g. in Washington's book; see also Prop. 2.2.1 in the survey If the base extension is abelian and not cyclic, stuff happens. There are many articles investigating this problem, but nothing as simple as in the cyclic case. 

This makes a little bit more precise what has already been said in the comments. This list of emigrants (most of them were forced to leave since they lost their jobs; this applies to Emmy Noether, Richard Brauer, and later to Artin, who had a Jewish wife. Siegel, as far as I know, left because he couldn't stand the situation). One reason for founding the Mathematical Reviews, by the way, was the pressure on the Zentralblatt put up by German mathematicians (including Hasse) not to let emigrants review articles by Germans. French and Russian were widely used after World War II because these countries had excellent and very influential mathematicians at the time. 

Let $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ and let $P = (3+2\sqrt{-5})$ denote a prime ideal of norm $29$ in the ring of integers of $K$. There does not exist a quadraic extension of $K$ ramified exactly at $P$, but there is one over the Hilbert class field $K(i)$ of $K$. This means that the ray class group modulo $P$ does not split into the product of the ideal class group, which has order $2$, and another group. In particular, the maximal abelian extension unramified outside of $P$ does not split into a compositum of an unramified extension and a purely ramified extension, and neither does $K^{\rm{ab}}$. 

$f = 1$. In this case, $L/k$ is unramified and $\ell \mid h(K)$ since $L/k$ is an abelian unramified extension- If $f$ is divisible by some prime number $p \equiv 1 \bmod \ell$, let $F$ denote the subfield of degree $\ell$ in the field of $p$-th roots of unity. By Abhyankar's Lemma, the extensions $KF/K$ and $LF/L$ are unramified and abelian, so $\ell \mid h(K)$. $f$ is only divisible by primes $p \equiv -1 \bmod \ell$ that remain inert in $k/{\mathbb Q}$. We assume that $\ell \nmid h(k)$ and have to show that $\ell \mid h(K)$. The ambiguous class number formula tells us that $\# Am(L/k) = \ell^{t-1}/(E_k:E_k \cap NL^\times)$, where $t$ is the number of primes dividing $f$, and where $E_k$ is the unit group of $k$. The number of strongly ambiguous ideals (those generated by ideals fixed by $\sigma$) is given by $\# Am_{st}(L/k) = \ell^{t-1}/(E_k: NE_L)$. If $\ell > 3$, or if $\ell = 3$ and $k \ne {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-3}\,)$, then the index $(E_k:E_k \cap NL^\times) = 1$ because $E_k = \{-1, +1\}$ and these are norms of units. Thus there must be at least two primes dividing $f$. But then the number of strongly ambiguous ideal classes is $\# Am_{st}(L/k) = \ell^{t-1}$ since the index $(E_k:NE_L) = 1$. Thus there is a strongly ambiguous ideal class of order $\ell$ generated by a prime ideal above one of the primes dividing $f$. But then the prime ideal in $K$ above this prime $p$ cannot be principal, hence has order $\ell$, and we conclude that $\ell \mid h(K)$. 

This approach is suggested by Tevian Dray and Corinne Manogue in their program of Bridging the Vector Calculus Gap. They focus on multivariable calculus and differential forms, but they discuss single-variable calculus (pdf) once. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have a textbook for that. 

Hake's Theorem, due to Heinrich Hake of Düsseldorf in 1921, says that an improper Henstock–Kurzweil integral (aka generalized Riemann integral, gauge integral, Perron integral, or Denjoy integral) on a bounded interval is already proper. That is, if $f$ is defined on a half-open interval $[a,c)$, $f$ is HK-integrable on $[a,b]$ for each $b$ satisfying $a \leq b < c$, and the limit of $\int_a^b f$ as $b \to c^-$ exists, then we may define $f(c)$ however we like and find that $f$ is integrable on $[a,c]$ and that $\int_a^c f$ equals the aforementioned limit. (The converse is also true; if $\int_a^c f$ exists, then it may be calculated as a limit.) I can't find anything about this Hake. Most references just say ‘Hake's theorem’, a few say ‘H. Hake’, and Bartle's book on the HK integral says ‘Heinrich Hake in 1921’. Bartle also gives a reference, an article in Mathematische Annalen, whose byline says ‘Heinrich Hake in Düsseldorf’. And that's it. Various online search attempts give me references to this theorem, the contemporary Düsseldorf telephone directory, and the 18th-century law professor Ludolf Heinrich Hake, but nothing more about the 20th-century mathematician who proved the theorem. Does anybody know anything about him? 

Like Terry Tao, I find the transience of slides to be a problem. This is one reason why I stopped using slides as such and began using a single continuous-scroll page for each topic. I lecture from the bottom of the page, so students who are behind can still see the top. (I'm also one of those people who mixes the projector and the board, with bullet points and formulas on the projector and worked-out examples on the board, so I don't scroll down the page very quickly. Fortunately I work in a facility where the lighting allows this.) 

As has already been remarked by Lasse Rempe-Gillen, you need to know what a Cauchy net is, say from a uniform structure. But since you want $\kappa$ to be discrete [edit: I had ‘complete’ here once] as a topological space, surely you just want it to be discrete as a uniform space, so let's do that. And then give $\kappa^\kappa$ the product uniformity. (For $\kappa := \omega$, this is the uniform structure that underlies the usual metric on Baire space.) So the answer is Yes, $\kappa^\kappa$ is complete. This is because every discrete uniform space is complete, and (as Lasse has remarked) any product of complete spaces is complete. Also, note that the underlying topology of the product uniformity is the product topology, so $\kappa^\kappa$ has the topology that you originally wanted. The cited facts are all part of my general knowledge; I will try to find specific references for them. 

The associativity of the secant method is, by the way, a consequence of the usual geometric interpretation of the group law on conics. 

In addition to Alex's answer I would like to point out that studying the group $K^\times/N(L^\times)$ is a perfectly fine goal (related of course to the validity of the Hasse norm principle in extensions of number fields), which should not simply be dismissed as a "wrong question". A good place to start is the work by Leonid Stern, the most recent article being On the norm groups of Galois $2\frak n$-extensions of algebraic number fields, J. Number Theory 129, No. 5, 1191-1204 (2009). 

$L/k$ is normal if and only if for every $\sigma \in G$ there is an $\alpha_\sigma \in K$ such that $\mu^{\sigma-1} = \alpha_\sigma^2$. Let $L/k$ be normal. Then we can define an element $[\beta]$ in the second cohomology group $H^2(G,\mu_2)$ with values in $\mu_2 = \{-1,+1\}$ by setting $$ \beta(\sigma,\tau) = \alpha_\sigma^\tau \alpha_\tau \alpha_{\sigma\tau}^{-1}. $$ If $L/k$ is normal, then $[\beta]$ is the element of the second cohomology group attached to the group extension $$ 1 \rightarrow \mu_2 \rightarrow Gal(L/k) \rightarrow Gal(K/k) \rightarrow 1. $$ 

Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality by Edward Frenkel is, in my opinion, a lot better than Lockhart's lament. 

How did Dirichlet express "this series by a definite integral" and derive the asymptotic expression for $g(t)$? Let me remark that Endres and Steiner (A new proof of the Voronoi summation formula) use Voronoi summation for proving the sharper estimate $$ g(t) \sim \frac1t \log \frac1t + \frac{\gamma}t + \frac14 + O(t) $$ as $t \to 0$. But this is not "easily found". How did Dirichlet transform his knowledge about the asymptotic behaviour of $\sum b_n e^{-nt}$ as $t \to 0$ into an average behaviour of $b_n$? This smells like a Tauberian result, but I'm not fluent enough in analytic number theory to see how easy this is. 

I don't think that there's a good answer to this. The following episode at least shows that people have been thinking about the problem of capitalizing Abelian for quite a while. In her letter to Hasse dated Oct. 29, 1932, Emmy Noether informed Hasse that Ferdinand Springer had demanded that adjectives like "abelian" and "galois" had to be capitalized in all journals published by Springer. On Dec. 9, 1932, she wrote that she had passed on "Hasse's declaration of war" via Blumenthal (editor of the Math. Annalen) to Springer. Apparently Hasse had demanded that this should remain the author's decision. 

A dimensionful real-valued quantity takes values in a $1$-dimensional real vector space (a ‘line’) rather than in the space of real numbers as such. Given two such quantities taking values in the line $L$, their sum also takes values in $L$; given a quantity taking values in $L$ and a quantity taking values in $L'$, their product takes values in $L \otimes L'$ (which is also a line). Dimensionless quantities are included in this, since $\mathbb{R}$ is itself a line, in fact the unit of the tensor product. So, instead of the Jordan (or whatever) algebra $A$, we really have an algebra $A^\bullet$ (I am making up this notation here), which is a completion of the direct sum over all lines $L$ of $A \otimes L$. It is worth checking that whatever functional calculus you rely on in $A$ also extends to $A^\bullet$, which is true if you include enough lines; for example, if $q$ takes values in $L$ (and never takes the value $0$), then $1/q$ takes values in the dual space $L^*$ (which is also a line). Formally, we can add quantities with different dimensions, obtaining a result in $L \oplus L' \subseteq A^\bullet$ (and even do things like $\sin q$ if $A^\bullet$ is completed appropriately), but what's important is that each expression in which the units balance has a $1$-dimensional subspace of $A^\bullet$ in which all of its values lie. To relate this to Qiaochu's answer, Qiaochu's $A$ is my $A^\bullet$, and my $A$ is the subspace of Qiaochu's $A$ that is fixed by the action of $G$. 

I don't think that there is anything interesting about this constructively, as long as we limit ourselves to finite sets in the strictest sense. The proof that a winning strategy exists gives us no help in finding the strategy, so in this sense it is nonconstructive, but we never needed help in finding a strategy. Only finitely many moves are possible, with only finitely many options for each move, so all that we ever had to do to find a winning strategy (if one exists) is to enumerate all of the possibilities. Practically, this is impossible, so it would be nice if an existence proof for such a strategy would shorten the search, but this is a separate issue from the acceptability of the proof for constructive mathematics. Put another way, we can already prove constructively, since there are only finitely many possible plays of the game, that one player or the other must have a winning strategy, so any proof that relies on this is still constructive. 

In a handwritten note on the reprint he sent to Gauss he remarked that $\sum 1/\log n$ (this is Gauss's version of the PNT, at least if you replace the sum by an integral) is a better estimate than Legendre's. I am a little bit puzzled as to why Dirichlet's claim to have proved the prime number theorem is not discussed anywhere in the literature. Or is it? 

This is a comment on the manuscript rather than an answer to your question. When I read that ${\mathbb Z}$-Euclidean principal binary quadratic forms correspond to norm-Euclidean quadratic orders, my immediate reaction was the guess that the non-principal forms must correspond to Lenstra's Euclidean ideal classes. This is in fact true, as a simple calculation shows. The nontrivial ideal class in $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-5})$ is generated by the prime ideal ${\mathfrak a} = (2,1+\sqrt{-5})$. By definition, this class is Euclidean if for every $\xi \in K$ there is an $\eta \in {\mathfrak a}$ such that $N(\xi - \eta) < N{\mathfrak a} = 2$. The identitiy $2(2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2) = (2x+y)^2 + 5y^2$ then shows that this is equivalent to the form $2x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2$ being a Euclidean quadratic form over ${\mathbb Z}$. Thus it seems that this form is missing from Houriet's list, and I believe that this is the only form missing. The known cases of Euclidean ideal classes for real quadratic fields (disc $K = 40, 60, 85$) show that the answer to problem 2 is negative: not every primitive Euclidean form represents $1$; one example is given by $2x^2 - 5y^2$, the nonprincipal form with discriminant $40$. This does not answer your actual question, but perhaps it shows that one has to be very careful with making conjectures that seem to be plausible in this area. Edit. Let $R$ be the ring of integers in a number field $K$, and let $S = R[i]$ denote a subring of the ring of integers in $L = K(i)$. I guess it is easy to see that the form $x^2 + y^2$ is Euclidean over $R$ (here and below: with respect to the absolute value of the norm) if and only if $S$ is Euclidean. But $disc\ S = \pm 4 (disc\ R)^2$ shows that if $S$ has class number $1$, then so does $R$ (because the UFD $S$ necessarily is the full ring of integers, so $disc\ L = \pm 4 (disc\ K)^2$). This shows that if $x^2 + y^2$ is Euclidean over $R$, then $R$ is a PID. Something similar clearly goes through for any binary quadratic form over the integers. The fact that the proof of this special case already uses class field theory indicates that one should not expect a 3-line proof of the general claim that if $R$ admits a Euclidean quadratic form, then $R$ is a PID.
