Just to be clear, I have not read enough about this subject to give a full answer, having only read Molotov's biased opinion. I am not sure I fully buy his opinion, considering what he said about the Holodomor. However, I feel he is correct in stating that the USSR would have lost if the invasion had started even 1 month earlier. I also liked his point about how odd the idea of an alliance with the British was. On another note, it was interesting to hear his first hand account of what all the major actors in WWII were like personally; he didn't like Ribbentrop very much! 

So I found out from a post on skeptics:SE that when Yuri Gagarin landed from being the first human in space during the Vostok 1 mission, he parachuted down and landed in the Soviet Union near the Volga river on a farm. Wikipedia recounts it like this: 

German racialism was historically flexible enough to accomodate pro-Chinese and pro-Japanese reconfigurations. Japan did not attack the Soviet Union as it was manifestly not in the interests of Japan to do so after the Nomohan incident (see Battles of Khalkhin Gol at the encyclopaedia). Germany did maintain diplomatic and political links with Japan. Some technology transfer occurred, and some trade in incredibly high value strategic goods. The level of coordination and trade was far less than the relationship between Britain and China for example. Yet China is one of the Allies. Propaganda often obscures the real relationships between states. 

Historical sources and methods are targeted at answering contextual questions about the meaning and nature of human behaviour and experience over time on the basis of the documentary record of the past. Questions must be timely: they must deal with change and continuity. They must deal with the situation in time. Questions must deal with the documentary record of the past: history is fundamentally a textual pursuit. Even when historians construct, for example, wage-price series in economic history they are reliant upon the textual records of the past. This question can become problematic when the documentary records of the past are recent in origin (for example: evidence supplied by archaeologists). Questions must deal in human practices and behaviours: while we can observe evidence for climatologists or botanists from the documentary record of the past, these activities then become biology or ecology. History itself is concerned with the human world of meanings and experiences. Many things which may not appear to initially be human meaning or experience (boat construction) actually are: the science, craft and practice of building boats is an intensely social and meaning driven endeavour. Questions must deal in context and meaning: Historians typically answer questions about meaning, rather than volume. While answers may be available for questions such as "How many soldiers were in a division in Germany?" a historian will seek to answer, "Why did Germans choose a certain divisional structure?" As such, many things that people wish to know about the past cannot be answered by historians, as the questions are not meaningful or contextual: a practice may be an irrelevancy, or the sources may not record the practice in a way (or at all) that allows it to be contextualised. This is because historians deal with the documentary record of the past, which tends to be documents that people cared about preserving (or did not seek to deliberately destroy). These records tend to be about the meaning of human social practices. Additionally, as historians read meaning from texts, the methods of reading meaning produce limitations on the answerable questions. The use of empathy or historical economic statistics reduce the number of produceable meanings. Thirdly, this is because mostly people want meaning and context questions about the past. "What was it like to be...?" rather than "How many nails in a hob nailed boot on average in 14th century Florence?" and the funding agencies support the former but not the latter question. 

From the 1620's on, it seems like England was endlessly dealing with battles between parliaments, kings and armies. Did these battles keep English leadership from getting overly involved in the development in the colonies? If so, did that help to create a sense of independence that helped lead toward eventual separation from the mother country; as well as a sense of personal liberty that helped shape the American constitution? 

in Paradise Lost, he references tons of ancient religious figures. Where would Milton have learned these things? 

In his lectures on iTunesU (link), Steven B. Smith reports that Aristotle wrote about many different systems of government that predated the Athenians. 

In reading about Thomas Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemings I learned how he basically took her on as a concubine when they lived in Paris. It seems that this sort of thing was commonplace in the antebellum south. I wonder if institutionalized sexual abuse was a feature of previous slave systems. Did slaves in Ancient Rome suffer as much sexual abuse? How about in Athens? Were the Spartans sexually abusive to the Helots? 

I personally don't like this question because it gives credence to racial theories. Scientifically speaking, there is more variation from individual to individual than there is between peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. Anyway, addressing your question: One theory I've heard is that King Phillip's war was the cause. The idea behind this theory is simple: When the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock in 1620, the Native Americans aided them in establishing themselves, and helped them not to starve, by teaching the pilgrims, people who had lived as refugees in the Urban Netherlands for a generation, to learn farming and survival skills. They even celebrated the first thanksgiving together. In New England, generally speaking, the contact between the Europeans and Natives Americans were more than cordial - there was intermarriage, and conversion to Christianity, and peaceful coexistence. The primary difference between the two populations was more one of lifestyle than one of race. By about 1670, the mixing of the two populations, combined with declining Native American populations and quality of life, set the stage for "King Phillips War" Supporting Source and Wikipedia links. The common narrative goes like this: Metacom, a Native American nicknamed "King Phillip" by the settlers, started attacking and slaughtering the colonial population. The English colonialist responded in kind, slaughtering the Native American population. Both sides killed whichever "enemy" they came across, including women and children. Persons of mixed heritage were victims of both sides. 5% of the settler and 40% of the Native American population died. The general slaughter led to well defined racial identities that didn't exist before the war, and set the stage for future separate ethnic trends in North America. There is, of course, an opposing theory presented in this book that the war was not about race at all, but was instead a civil war intended to increase British control of the region, which used "divide and conquer" strategies, split what was a unified community to increase colonial power. One results of the increase British control was marginalization of the Native population, and a stronger racial identity for the settlers. 

I think they left some ideas that still resinate in western culture. The word "spartan" means "marked by strict self-discipline or self-denial" or "marked by simplicity, frugality, or avoidance of luxury and comfort" definition The word "laconic" "using few words in speech or writing" [definition] Most significantly, I've read that Plato was greatly influenced by Sparta. After witnessing what he thought was chaos in Athenian democracy (i.e. the execution of Socrates), Plato was perhaps attracted to the stability offered by a permanent ruling elite. 

I'm gonna guess the Depression of the 1930's, WWII and the aftermath that lasted well into the 1950's. From there, actual growth in Wester Europe and the US probably kept folks decently employed. The social and economic turmoil of the late 1960's and early 1970's was a common theme across western society. 

During the Hundred Schools period (600-221 BCE) Chinese cultures changed significantly as ideas were contested amongst the ruling elite. What do we know of peasant cultures in China during this period? What was their yearly economy? Their diet? Their marriage customs? Their religions? Do we have accounts of their lives and thoughts? Do we have waste fragment texts explaining their culture? What was the every day life of the ordinary person in China in this period, and which major sources support such an account? 

"Event" isn't a common term in historiography. The idea that a constellation of behaviours can be summed up in a neat little bundle and assigned a fixed and undisputed meaning is counter-intuitive for both humanities and social science historians. In particular, "events" appear to be readily assigned "meanings," which most historians view even more suspiciously. (Except, of course, as the historical study of public history meanings themselves). 

Put simply, the British planted the seeds for colonial control in the early 1800s, needed about 50 more years to fully exploit the Chinese people. The advent of the Soviet Union, WWII, the UN, and the end of colonialism in the 1960s precluded formal colonial control of china. It is noteworthy, however, that Tibet, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Manchuria, Mongolia, Nanjing, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Dalien, Shandong province, Qingdao, Harbin, Eastern Siberia, and parts of Beijing, and many more regions in China were formally under control by European, American, and Japanese interests. More time was required for these colonial interested to control all of China. It is useful to pose question as by comparison, like "If India was colonized, why not China? South Asia had a comparable population and military strength to China in the 15th century, so why not?" The method by which Britain came to control India was not one of military conquest; it was more of an expansion of economic interests. Here's how Britain came to control India: 

In these iTunes U lectures on Milton, John Rogers suggest that Milton was espousing "monism" in Paradise Lost; that the theology of Paradise Lost involved the ideas that the soul and body are one and that everything is part of God. This seemed similar to Spinoza's philosophy. Even if I have this all wrong, I wondered if Milton and Spinoza knew of or about each other. 

I know the founders like Jefferson and Madison were extremely well read. I've heard they were very effected by the enlightenment. Do we know with any certainty if they read Spinoza? 

How did the American college fraternity and sorority system come to incorporate ancient greek? Was this an 19th century phenomenon? That is my question. Any color on the following would also be appreciated. Other than in some of the 19th century school architecture, was this reflected elsewhere in academia (or in the society at large)? The question struck me when reading about the Spartan mess halls. It all seemed very similar to my fraternity (dominated by athletes, mostly football), except there was no homosexual sex (that I'm aware of). Even the game of football itself - as well as it's antecedent, rugby - struck me as a ritualized form of hoplite warfare. 

Many Native Americans had died of Old World disease, Africans did not When the Europeans showed up in the New World, they brought disease that killed a large portion of the local people (60%? 80%? 90%? ). This meant, from the European standpoint, that in the 1500's and 1600's, New World land was available for the taking. West Africa, on the other hand, had a high population density. Europeans were militarily not strong enough in the 1700's even to take and control African land; it would have been too expensive to defeat the Africans in war to take the land, and the Europeans would have had difficulty in holding the land as well. It just wasn't feasible to steal African land. Why didn't the Africans grow sugar and export it to Europe? Cash crops and subsistence farming are a different enterprise; with its higher population, subsistence farming was widespread in Africa, so once again, there was not enough land available to do cash cropping. Edit: Mayo aptly points out that Europeans had issues with Tropical Africans diseases, especially Malaria. This is an excellent point, although yellow fever killed plenty of Europeans in the New World. 

This is a conceit almost entirely confined to US internal propaganda, and a particular kind of instrumentalist sociology that likes to divide populations based on decile groups of income received. There will always be that 40-60% of income receivers who earn greater than the bottom 40% and less than the top 40%. This is not a coherent theoretical tool. 

The following video should give you an overview of the working class experience of the 1930s in the United States, combined with a basic look at the material culture of the era. youtube: US Dept. Labor For an depth accounts, I have to immediately recommend social history. ABC-CLIO publishes a ten volume account of the United States in the 20th century, but these volumes are priced at $1000 for the set—refer to your local library. Correspondingly, the United States is viewed as the "model" society for the study of "Fordism," and historical works on Fordism as a theoretical phenomena will discuss the 1930s. From a concrete perspective: US material culture in the 1930s was dictated by the expansion of consumer industries in the 1920s combined with the recession of the 1930s. In urban life housing stock was dominated by dormitory apartments built during previous housing booms, these were poorly watered and sewered, if sewered at all. If you are familiar with the "ghettos" of the 1970s, this was the standard of urban housing. Suburban life did not exist in the 1930s, there was a stark urban/rural divide. Far more small shop keepers and professionals existed in the 1930s than today. Most commodities would be purchased through small locally owned stores. Workers bought on local credit far more than today, as they did not hold bank accounts or credit cards. Widespread poverty dictated the life of most Americans in the 1930s, while the "well to do" who had enough to eat and did not live in slums lived in fear of penury. Only a few super rich, then as now, were secure in their lives. Incidentally, apart from a small number of well known movie actors, and the voices of a few radio stars, the super rich made up US celebrity culture, which was far less developed. Most urban people had tap water within walking distance. Prepared food items were increasingly sold as commodities (bottled soda, etc) replacing the on site manufacture of similar goods in specialist stores. A wide spread consumer culture existed in the sense that advertised and packaged goods existed, with marked consumer preference for items varying in little respect. Tobacco was far more widely used. Clothing was a major purchase, as was furniture, equivalent in many ways to "big ticket consumer items." People wore hats. The rich owned and wore devices or implements made out of fine metal (watches, paper openers, cuff links). The material culture of the working class was dominated by iron and tin goods, and paper and glass in recycled packaging. Radios were replacing pianos as the method of domestic entertainment, and had often been purchased previously in a period of boom. Electricity was mainly for lighting. Technologies which have now disappeared which existed in the 1930s include: postal mail within cities (it was the equivalent of a very formal text message), telegraphy (a long distance SMS), the cinema (acted like television), radio plays, iron stoves, street cars / trams. 

Notes [1] Bayly, Christopher Alan. Indian society and the making of the British Empire. No. 2002. Cambridge University Press, 1988. [2] The best example of this is related to Tea, Opium, and the relationship between the British Empire and the Qing dynasty. According to [1], they learned how to do this within the Mogul Empire when expanding the British East India Company. It was also used in the African expansion. Because the Opium trade / wars are the easiest example, I will explain that. Around 1750 - 1800 the British were importing a lot of Tea from Qing China. The only payment that the Qing would accept was silver. Britain was importing so much Tea around 1790 that the trade deficit was causing economic problems. They sent George Macartney to negotiate new trading rules so that the British Empire could trade goods instead of silver, reducing the deficit. For a variety of reasons, the Qing refused and maintained the silver requirement.[3] The British tried a bunch of ways to get this to change, and during the Napoleonic wars the figured out that they could grow Opium in India and smuggle it into China. It turned out (not surprising to us today) that Opium smuggling was very profitable, and that once you get customers, the are fairly "loyal".[3] This smuggling went on for a while, until Opium use combined with a loss of silver bullion was causing economic hardship and social breakdown. The Qing dynasty responded by shutting down the Opium trade, which sparked the Opium wars. The Qing lost the Opium wars, and the British got a bunch of small colonies in China and were free to trade as they pleased.[3] The areas administered by the British (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Xiamen) were originally small villages, and they quickly became the wealthiest areas of China. Why? Because the wealth of the Chinese hinterland was flowing out of China through these port cities.[3] Over time, the colonial possessions were gaining not just wealth, but also power. The power of the British and other Europeans and Japan was increasing throughout China, while formally the Qing dynasty was still in control. The Qing Dynasty was a rich, powerful country. It was richer and had a better economy and a better educated elite in 1750 than any other part of the world. It took a long time for this society to crumble, and the elite understood what the British were doing, and some fought back. In contrast, Africans were already quite divided when the British were moving in. Compared with the Germans and French, the British tended to leave the existing power structure in place and extracted just the wealth of the local area (Indirect Rule? Protectorate? Shaka Zulu). The British in the late 1800s had several advantages: They were really good at conquering and administering colonies, they were rich and industrial. They knew how to extract the wealth of the colonies. [3] Lipman, Jonathan N., Barbara Molony, and Michael A. Robinson. Modern East Asia: An Integrated History. Pearson, 2011.
