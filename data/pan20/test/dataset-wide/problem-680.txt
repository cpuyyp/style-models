On the assumption that everything was fitted properly, my first guess would be chain is too long, my second would be that derailleur adjustment is required, but this guess doesn't specifically fit your description of "hard" pedalling. But these are only guesses, remember, maybe your LBS can help you some more. 

Given the added details in the question, I'd probably agree with @tommy_o's answer and @armb's comment, but would also say this: It sounds like you do not currently ride and are looking to start. If this is the case, I wouldn't be tempted to spend too much money first time around. Obviously you need to spend enough to be comfortable that what you buy is not going to fall apart. But beyond that, your scenario will probably go one of three ways. 

The lightest lock I have found which I see as "strong enough" is the Abus 401 d-lock, which weighs in at approximately 1kg. Might that be light enough for you? Now, when I say "strong enough", what I actually mean is that this lock has a "Sold Secure Gold" rating - this is a scheme used by the UK insurance industry, which basically means that if I attach my bike to something using this lock and the bike is subsequently stolen, then my insurance company will cough up. As far as I am aware this is the lightest lock to meet this standard, and I know of no lightweight chain that I would consider appropriate. As far as I am concerned bike locks have two purposes. First, to deter. Second, to make sure the insurance company pays out should the worst happen. They will not prevent. Now having said that I almost never use this lock. This is because when I am out on a leisure ride, I hardly ever park the bike up. If I know I'm going to make a stop, or if I'm touring, I will carry this lock, but not otherwise. When my bikes are at home, they're secured by (insurance approved) anchors to the garage floor by those heavy chains and d-locks that you've already discovered (in general I like the Kryptonite Fahgeddaboutit range which will deter and are insurance approved). But those locks live in the garage and don't travel. When I am commuting, I keep a set of locks at each end. Works out expensive but as you say, they're heavy. And yes, I mix a chain and a d-lock, both conforming to this Sold Secure Gold standard. Note lastly that I make absolutely no claim that "Sold Secure Gold" locks are any good at what they do! In fact I've heard others say that its just a scam. But they keep the insurance company happy, that's all. 

Definitely something plastic, as that's going to be both safer and lighter than glass. I'd look for something that was polarizing, as that will reduce glare, and something that offers UV protection. You also should be aware that different colour lenses suit different light conditions, so you might need to make a decision based upon when you normally ride. I note that you live in London - I'm in the UK too and given our frequently poor light conditions, for the majority of the year I ride with clear (but high contrast) lenses. Here's a colour chart I found a couple of years ago, to give you an idea. As for replaceable lenses, they're a great idea but make sure you have an idea of the costs involved first. I got some glasses a couple of years ago and found that the cost of the spare lenses was disproportionate to the cost of the glasses themselves. (But still cheaper than 2 pairs of glasses.) Another thing would be fit. You don't want them moving around as you cycle - I made the mistake once of buying some nice glasses mail order, when they arrived they were too loose on my head. Lastly, if you come the the same conclusion as I did about using clear lenses, consider safety glasses such as these. They hit the same quality standards as bike glasses but are a fraction of the price. They are more fragile than cycling glasses but if I go through three pairs a year, its still cheaper. Aside from that, how much do you want to spend? The pros seem to ride Oakley Radarlocks at the moment but, for what they are, the price is staggering. 

None of this is particularly good news for you I'm afraid. You can park pretty much anywhere provided there's space, that you're off the road, and that the road isn't already closed. In an RV, in the Alps, I would think you need to think about being in place the day before. Certainly, they will close the roads to traffic probably no later than breakfast time. But it's not just whether the roads are open, it is whether there is anywhere to park (especially in an Alpine pass). In general, road restrictions are lifted very shortly after the race has passed - 5 or 10 minutes. But be aware that, at that point in time, the world and his wife are trying to get away, so you're in an instant traffic jam. Life may get more complicated if you are on a mountain, and the stage has a mountain top finish. If this is the case, expect the teams and the officials to have priority getting down the mountain after the race is over. It wouldn't surprise me if you were held for some time before you could leave. One thing you can do to try to counter all this is to park a distance away from the route, and then to either walk or cycle. This has worked for me in the past (especially beating traffic afterwards) but may or may not be practical for you. But certainly bicycles tend to be ignored by the gendarmes and you're pretty safe to be riding on the race route until shortly before the caravane passes (an hour or so before the race itself). Whenever I go to the Tour de France I always come up with a cunning plan to try and beat the crowds, and it is never quite cunning enough, just because there are so many people. 

I would ask myself the question: "Even if it looks like the tyre is ok, do I really want the hassle of the thing blowing 10 miles from home - even if there's only one chance in a hundred - and then having to change the tube, hoping it doesn't re-puncture, all the while freezing your ** off? And probably in the dark too. And even then, when you get home, having to replace the tyre in any case." Compared to the price of a new tyre I know what my answer would be. (I should probaby add that tyres in general are more susceptible in thev walls, which would sway me even more.) Congratulations for keeping your cool by the way. Your logic seems totally sound in terms of this guy being a psycho but very often adrenaline wins hands-down over rationality.
