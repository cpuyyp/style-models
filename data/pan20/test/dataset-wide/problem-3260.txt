Gustav Eriksson went from fugitive without anything to him but his name to King of Sweden in less than three years. In september 1519 he escaped from his imprisonment in Denmark. In november 1520, his father, and most male relatives, were killed in the Stockholm bloodbath By Christian II of Denmark. His female relatives were imprisoned, and the family holdings confiscated. He was essentially a fugitive in Sweden, with no close relatives or possesions. He went to Dalecarlia to rouse the inhabitants there to rebellion. In january 1521, he was appointed commander of the dalecarlians, who marched south and successfully captured several castles and towns. Other parts of Sweden also rebelled. In August the same year, he was appointed Steward of the realm by the rebellious Swedes. He also managed to get money and troops from Lübeck in 1522. He was elected king June 6 1523, and from October the same year, he controlled all of Sweden. 

(a): "Lekarerätt" (b): Actually"spelman", which is not tied to a specific instrument This law also appears in the Ostrogothic law, and in manuscripts of the Danish Jyske lov, so it seems to have been quite well known. Thus, medieval Scandinavians accorded travelling musicians protection on par with female thralls, even subjecting them to a degrading mock trial by arms if they should complain. They were certainly not well respected. 

I was reading a book that touched on Eric of Pomerania, King of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. After he was dethroned in 1439, he set up as a pirate in the Baltic. Now, the book claims that this was not entirely strange, and that privateers existed and had recognised legal status. Checking Wikipedia, I found that England had indeed issued letters of marque for over a hundred years by then, and that the idea reached back another fifty or so years. However, I am wondering what kind of protection such a letter (or other equivalent proof of being employed by a state) would give someone when captured by another state. Klaus Störtebeker was executed for piracy, but that was after the Victual brothers had stopped being privateers and moved on to "real" pirating. Would it possibly have been different if he had been captured when King Albert was still at war with Queen Margaret? I'm primarily interested in the fifteenth century and northern Europe, but arguments and examples from later (or earlier) and other parts of Europe are acceptable as substitutes. 

You might be thinking of the Nine worthies, nine kings which personified the chivalric virtues. They were: 

The Anglo-Swedish war of 1810-1812. A phoney war forced upon Sweden after the devastating defeat in the Finnish war; neither side wanted to fight the other, and no battles were fought. There were, however, a formal declaration of war and a signed peace, and British troops that were stationed at the Island of Hanö occupied it during the war. 

It appears that he got this from Bede's The reckoning of time, but it does show that the knowledge was well spread. Vincent of Beauvais (c. 1184/1194 – c. 1264) correctly described what would happen if an object was dropped in a hole through the entire world. Nicole Oresme (c. 1320–1325 – 1382) correctly argued that there were no way of knowing if it was the Earth that rotated, or the celestial sphere; if the air and water moved with the Earth, there would be no physical sensation. He did in the end say that he believed in a stationary Earth, but that seems more a matter of tradition. Sources I translated the passage from Adam from the Swedish of Emanuel Svenberg's translation. Vincent of Beauvais I found mentioned in C.S. Lewis The Discarded Image. Nicole Oresme is quoted at length in Károly Simonyi's A cultural history of physics. It also contains a useful introduction to what classical works were available to medieval scholars. 

Yes You do not need to look further than Aristotle. In On the soul, he considered plants to have a "soul" (we would perhaps instead call it "essence") which made them capable of two things: reproduction and growth. The "souls" of animals also gave them the power to sense the world and move in it, and the human "soul" gave rational thought. 

The Victual brothers, a fourteenth and fifteenth century group first organised to aid King Albert when he tried to defend against Queen Margaret in a war for the Swedish crown. They can arguably have been said to have started as a band of privateers, but when Albert was forced to make peace and give up his crown, they continued their piracy without any veneer of legitimacy. They had safe harbours in Rostock, Ribnitz, Wismar and Stralsund, and occupied and plundered around the Baltic sea and as far away as in Frisia. They eventually occupied Gotland, and brought all trade in the Baltic to a halt. Margaret had by that time united Denmark, Norway and Sweden, but sought help from Richard II in England. Eventually, the Teutonic order drove them from Gotland. The Victual brothers were followed by the Likedeelers, based in Frisia, which plundered around the North sea instead, until about 1440. 

I have no definitive answer, but I can point to a few differences. First, as you noted, Poland of 1665-1660 had indeed very little in the way of allies, whereas in 1700-1712, they were at least allied to Russia, and in some manner to Saxony. However, the Polish-Saxon king Augustus had only declared war as Polish king, so while Saxony was a safe home ground for him, he could not use it fully. Even so, the war did not end until Charles decided to ignore this technicality and invaded Saxony. The Russians, for their part, were largely busy trying to capture and hold on to land around present day St Petersburg, and sent relatively little help to Poland (they were probably happy that two of their strongest neighbours duked it out with eachother; they would certainly make sure to gain from the weaknesses of both later). Second, in 1665, Sweden was the aggressor, while in 1700, Poland was the aggressor. It is possible that the Poles found it easier to gather to defend against an enemy that they did not feel had been forced on them by their king. Third, the Swedish army was wastly different. The army of 1665 was essentially similar to the one that had fought the Thirty years war: mostly mercenaries and some conscripts. It was thus dependant on plunder (this was part of the reason the Swedes invaded from the start: they needed a new war to pay for the old one), and needed a peace which guaranteed enough money that it could be paid off. The army of 1700 mainly consisted of croft soldiers, which could be kept in the field almost indefinately, were very well drilled, and had no special conditions for stopping to fight (more on this below). The main drawback was that it was hard to replace if it suffered defeat, which would later prove to be fatal, but worked very well during this part of the war. Thus, the army of 1700 was overall more well trained, more disciplined, and was not about to complain about lack of pay. This made it possible for Charles to fight where and when he chose, even in the face of setbacks. Fourth, Charles XII was a vastly different creature from Charles X Gustaf, and their goals were different. Charles XII saw it as his mission to punish Augustus until he no longer was a threat to Sweden. Charles X Gustaf mostly wanted to conquer and plunder, preferably as quickly as possible. However, once the war had dragged on for several years, with no peace in sight (Poland's political division for once was a kind of advantage), and the opportunity came, he prefered to cut his losses in Poland and try to march against Denmark instead (with results beyond what anyone could have reasonably expected). Thus, while I can not really point to any deciding differences on the Polish side, the Swedish armies were so different that they might be considered from different countries. One wanted to make a quick grab of land and valuables, while the other wanted to make sure that Poland learnt a lesson about going to war with Sweden. When the first failed in it's goal, it was better to move on to another target, while the latter could keep trying until it was soundly defeated. Sources The above was written of the top of my head, but a good account of the deluge is Peter Englund's Den oövervinnerlige, "The Invincible" (not sure if it is available in English). For the Great northern war, Frans G. Bengtsson's biography Karl XII:s levnad, "The life of Charles XII, King of Sweden" is somewhat old, not very scholarly, but for the most part very readable. 

An example of solid food made from sprouted seeds is the Finnish speciality of mämmi/memma, which is made from malted rye and traditionally eaten at Easter. It seems to be attested since at least the 18th century (source in Finnish, I used Google translate). 

Avancez! was the personal motto of William Chalmers, a member of the Swedish East India Company, who left about half of his personal wealth to supply for a school which eventually became the current university (the other half went to Sahlgrenska sjukhuset, a hospital founded by one of his colleagues). The school has copied his motto. 

You usually don't get casualties that goes so high; one side or the other will have the sense to realise that the battle is lost and retreat. When they can't, their losses will ramp up while the winner's will stay relatively modest. One battle with very high losses on both sides is the Dano-Swedish Battle of Lund. However, that was not due to the generals grinding the units down; it was a very confused affair where the Swedish cavalry broke of to chase the Danish cavalry, while the Swedish infantry was very hard pressed and would have lost if the cavalry had not returned. In the end, the casualty rates for both armies where over 50 % (including wounded and prisoners of war). It has been noted as one of the bloodiest pitched battles ever. 

Harald Hardrada started out as a member of the Varangian guard, and served in several campaigns in different parts of the Empire. Towards what would be the end of his career in Byzantium, he was awarded the titles Spatharokandidatos and Protospatharios. While these titles do not seem to have been much more than court titles, they do indicate that he was a known and important person. He also played a role in the fighting over who would succeed Michael IV as Emperor. 

(Lots of interesting stuff here: the first three brothers were all married to the same woman, Ragnhild, who killed them off and also set her nephews against eachother. Ljot fought against MacBeth). Well, if you include people who claimed to be a son of the king and aspired to the throne but didn't quite get there, the sons of Magnus Barefoot of Norway qualifies: 

Britain (sort of) In 410 CE, the Roman emperor Honorius refused to send soldiers to the island to defend it, basically leaving it to fend for itself against the invaders from across the sea. This effectively led to the end of Britannia as a Roman province. 

Probably not. In general, the motif of a man and woman embracing is very common on guldgubbar, but there is nothing overtly sexual about them. Occasionally, there will be some kind of tree behind them. A Google image search of "guldgubber" will give you several examples This does not mean that this could not be an exception. However, I found a clearer picture of the same guldgubbe here. I have to say that I can see neither leafy boughs nor anything else vaguely phallic. If Viking age artists (which, admittedly, were a few centuries later) wanted to depict something a phallos, they could be explicit, see this statue, likely of Frey. Finally, any sort of identification with people or gods from myths and legends can not be taken as anything more than guesses.
