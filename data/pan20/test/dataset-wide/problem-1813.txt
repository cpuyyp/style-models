I am trying to deploy a Rails application in the Phusion-Passenger Docker image: $URL$ The Gemfile for the application specifies Ruby version 2.3.1, but the image comes with 2.2.5 by default, so bundle install fails. I've read the documentation a couple of times, but it isn't clear to me if it is possible to user a different major/minor version of Ruby with this image. I have tried the following in the Dockerfile 

Create the user in the Default Directory (Active Directory) with whatever permission you want Follow the steps in the link above to create a new subscription user, which you can then choose from the list of users in the Active Directory Log out of everything and then try to login at $URL$ as the new user 

They can only use 1 AMI They can only deploy to 1 specific VPC subnet They can only use 1 specific VPC security group 

However, when the user tries to upload a file using SCP, they can't, as the dev_login script is interrupting the process. Is it possible to use the 

I use the following directive in sshd_config to detect if the user trying to login to a server is called developer, and issue a bash script to the user if that is the case: 

This is every SysAdmin's nightmare of things to do. Basically we want to control who has access to which hosts. As simple it may sound, the problem is to find a scalable and low maintenance(mgmt. overhead) solution. We use bcfg2 for Config Mgmt much like Cfengine & puppet. Some ways: 

Through VPN, you can access both your local network(corp/home) and remote network(devlopment net) simultaneously, whereas when you SSH to some server, you pretty much on remote network. VPN is one of the alternatives, when your development servers are on a separate network and there are no routes to access it from main/corp network. 

I did similar project 2 years ago and I was in similar position not knowing where to start and how to tie the ends together. Step1: Figure out what you want to accomplish and write it down. Step2: See if the requirements are realistic and can be accomplished altogether. If not, what items are you willing to sacrifice. (This is where it takes a long time). step3: Choose a platform for LDAP. in your case, you already have an existing one. step4: Documenting & Testing. step5: The cut over plan is most critical as it doesn't matter if you accomplish all you wanted to but also to make sure there is a smooth transition. In my case, we had to do in a phased manner. From reading you comments above looks like you already have Openldap in production. Your requirements look like: a) Allowing users to use same password policy on AD. b) User accounts to propagate to LDAP automatically. Answer to a) You can setup a PAM pass-through module in LDAP to delegate password authentication to a DC via kerberos. In this way you will not have the headache of maintaining password in two places. I did on 389-DS LDAP, and the documentation link should be sufficient. When a user authenticates, the PAM module checks if user account exists in LDAP and if so, passes the passwd to PAM stack with krb5.so to authenticate. Check 389-DS documentation which should apply here too. Answer to b) I hit all the cylinders to figure out a way to use a ready solution but nothing came close. This is because you have to massage the schema for accounts and groups. So I with the help of a colleague wrote a script in perl to sync the users & groups from AD to LDAP. A snippe to f code is here. 

I have 2 AWS accounts and have set up cross account authentication using IAM roles. I have created a AWS CLI named profile for the second account, which uses a role_arn and specifies my default profile as the source_profile. For my default profile, I keep my KEY and SECRET as environment variables, rather than as static strings in the ~/.aws/credentials file. However, when I switch to the named profile, and query the API, I get the following error: 

This seems to be the default behaviour for this plugin, so it has to be managed using the plugin features. Basically, you have to set up the plugin to backup-then-delete the objects with a prefix to the same bucket. In that way, Logstash will skip object when it polls the bucket after the next interval. Sample config: 

Your terminology isn't very accurate so its hard to tell what you are trying to do. Cloudformation creates "stacks". You can create a stack that contains an RDS instance. If you want to update a stack, you can upload an updated JSON template to that stack. The only changes that will be applied to the stack are the changes from the original JSON template that was used to create the stack. So, if you have an RDS instance in the stack, and your updated template does not include any changes to that RDS instance, applying an updated template (which changes other parts of your stack) will not impact your RDS instance. If your updated template contains changes to your RDS instance, then, depending on what those changes are, your existing RDS instance could be deleted. I would advise testing on a dummy stack first. 

I have found one way of doing this but looks like it will only partially solve it. Number of conflicting users: 250 Number of hosts with homeDirs: 50 seed for script. 

We are using SCCM to deploy Office 2010 and it has worked very well. Most of the customization is done using the 'setup.exe /admin'. We divide desktops, laptops and servers to different collections(similar to OU in AD) and then further division based on tiers of deployment like IT, Accounts, sales, Executives. If anyone is looking for Windows 7 deployment, then SCCM 2007/2012 is way to go. It has a little learning curve as some of things just don't work out of box and need to be worked over-and-over again. But the end result is worth the effort. I used this link as reference for packaging Office 2010 for SCCM. 

Thanks for the great responses. Since I will end up using the existing insfrastructure, I am going to answer my own question. :) I am not sure if this is a valid method but I gave points for all possible solutions. In short: I will be using SCCM for deploying Windows OS and packages. MDT for managing and testing images. When a client PXE boots, it will have two options: Install Windows/Install RHEL. After the authentication, the OS installation is automated. SCCM is used for post deployment operations and for linux I am going to test puppet/bcfg2. Thanks again. 

I am currently migrating a DNS zone from one DNS server provider to another. I am trying to estimate how long it will take for the change to propagate, and to understand what the delay might be if I chose to rollback mid-stream. Previously, I thought I could do: 

Must people who are tricking around with it for the first time will run it on a single server, and then spend days trying to figure out why the health goes yellow due to unassigned shards. 

I've confirmed that NGinx is preserving all the Environment Variables that I need. The difficultly seems to be with this line (line 11): 

Is there any way I can get a named profile to refer to my environment variable credentials rather than static credentials in ~/.aws/credentials? 

This is logged 32 times during the 16 minute outage I am trying to figure out what is going on here. My concern is that due to deficiencies in my balancer config, that the balancer is repeatedly trying to send requests to the rebooting server (and therefore returning errors to the user). Why is Apache repeatedly telling me that it is "disabling worker"? Does the balancer module intermittently send user requests to the failing node, to try and determine if it is back up, or does it have its own internal health checking mechanism that is invisible to the user? 

To visualize and administer LDAP, there are many options, here are some. I personally use ldapsh to perform some quick ldap edits. It visualizes your ldap tree as directory structure which is easy to navigate and make edits using vim or your fav editor. 

(the port number is the office extension and was available). Similarly for other PCs and users. Remote user side: The user working from home will log on to WebVPN and start the Java Application. Once started, he/she can open mstsc.exe /span (/multimon for windows 7) and connect to 127.0.10.11:8891. Windows XP users might have issue with spanning across multiple monitors, when you maximize a window it will stretch across all monitors. In that case, use SplitView. Recommendation: WebVPN is much better than RRAS or client-based solution. You can setup many applications to stream thru VPN without needing to install it locally. Manage Home PC over Internet:(If you have a situation like me) In order to manage the remote home PC over internet, we used a NetSupport with Gateway enabled feature. Configure Netsupport gateway on the DMZ server(preferably windows) and edit firewall rules to allow traffic over internet. On home PC setup the http communication to the public IP or DNS address. Then you can connect NetSuport console to the remote gateway and just connect to the PC over internet. It communicates over HTTPS. We looked at MS Intune for this, but it doesn't allow unattended RDP which we needed as the executive might just walk-in and say, please fix my home PC. :/
