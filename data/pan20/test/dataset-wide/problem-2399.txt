It might be a cultural thing; But we should all stop trying to please the whole world and start to action what is practically good and with good intentions. Follow the dharma and action without fears. Think about it, is it justified to do bad deeds just because somebody threatens you to? 

In Buddhism there are concepts that are so complex that transcends beyond common reasonable, objective thinking. Therefore to your question, the answer is obviously "No". The question instead should be: Does common 'reasonable and objective' thinking downplay the depths of true Buddhism teachings? This will eventually guide you through your doubts. 

In simple terms: Precepts = refraining from actions. My understanding is that the 5 Precepts not only helps us from creating negative karma (Kamma = intention + actions) but also helps us in cultivating a foundation to release our attachment to the 5 Skandhas. (Actions being external factors of attachments.) To your question: [My question is how fair or correct to narrow third precept to sexual misconduct or adultery?] <--- I do not see any bits of "unfair" or "incorrectness" to limit sexual misconduct to the third precept. No matter in Theravada or Mahayana, they have given numerous examples and conditions on what is considered as Sexual Misconduct and inappropriate actions. And the range of stuff is very wide. [Does over-thinking violate third precept because its a misconduct of mind due to uncontrollable and misuse mind?] <--- No. The 5 precepts corresponds to actions only. Over-thinking is addressed through training the mind. A method of training one's mind is to observe how they arise from the 3 poisons: Greed, Hate, Ignorance, and then apply respective antidotes (Generosity, Loving-kindness, and Wisdom). This training is obviously the core teachings of the Buddha, i.e. the 4 noble truths and 8 folds paths. 

My experience of letting go and detaching I know that meditating on letting go and detachment is a fruitful activity. I experience physical discharge when I see I am holding on to something, that isn't true, and I let it go. In other words, I detach from it. As a variant to this meditation practice I also attach again. That is, I try to get myself back into that feeling that I had when I was attached. The moment that I notice the slightest mental activity of getting carried away again, I reevaluate that it isn't true and keep my focus there until I feel I am detaching again. I do this a couple of times until I know longer feel any interest arise anymore when I focus on attaching, and thus, the attachment doesn't happen anymore. To me it is like getting bored with the subject. There is nothing in it for me anymore that I want to grasp. It seems that all energy that caused any attachment dissipated. Stop creating mental constructs instead of letting go of them Now on the the purpose of this question. Today I realized that what I attach to is always a mental construct. And that mental construct is always created by myself. Then I came to think about the words 'letting go' and 'detaching'. These words seem to imply there is something there, that exist on their own, of which you 'need' to 'let go' and 'detach'. There is something, but not there in objective reality, but here in subjective mental constructs. What if, the moment I observe a mental construct, I realize I don't want to create that mental construct in the first place. Then there is nothing to let go, there is nothing to detach from, as it simply doesn't exist anymore. It isn't being created in the first place. That puts me in the chair of being the 'creator' of all my experience. So then I do not practice the 'letting go' and 'detachment' from anything anymore, I practice the 'stop creating' of unfruitful mental constructs, which leaves energy for creating mental activity that is fruitful. Questions: 

Buddhism views suffering as coming from 8 different forms, as below: Suffering of birth; Suffering of old age, Suffering of sickness, Suffering of death, Suffering of getting what you don't want, Suffering of not getting what you want, Suffering of getting what you want while not being able to hold onto it forever, and then there is the most mysterious one of all, which is all pervasive suffering or misery. Therefore, in mainstream Buddhism, it is widely accepted that "Suffering is inevitable" so long as your are still in the wheel of re-incarnation. (Un-enlightened). The core of Buddhism teaches about treating suffering (4 noble truths) through enlightenment (8-folds path). Hence, from the above list, there was no further dissection of pain vs suffering, because that would be redundant and further complicate matters. In comparison, it seems DBT basically replaced the word "Suffering" from Buddhism's context, with the word "Pain" in DBT's context. Not saying DBT is less comprehensive, after all it is a researched therapy with Buddhism flavors. I believe it's probably more useful and easier to be accepted to treat those people with different conventional/religious backgrounds. Always be mindful that - Suffering and pleasure are two sides of the same coin. 

To teach mindfulness is one thing; To teach the dharma is another thing. Supplementing my original comment to the question and simply put: If the corporation is unethical, anything/any means that supports this corporation, is unethical. 

I believe in patterns, and patterns of patterns, where scale is of secondary importance. Much like a fractal. The formula is more fundamental then the form. From there on, I believe that the mind will always be delusional. That is inherent to the formula by which it operates. The hypothesis is supported by the following: an illusion arises when the mind perceives something with an error. Hence the mind will never have a 100% accurate map of reality, and thus will always be delusional to some extent. Bridging to Samsara: I do not believe that there is an end stage, that it is boolean like: you either are in samsara, or you are not. I believe that to be true for very specific 'mental puzzles' though (more on that later). So I think, like with all things, that samsara is a concept. If you think of samsara to exist by itself, it is an illusion. Moving forward from this point of view I think that samsara can be experienced on a micro scale and macro scale. Macro scale would be to exerperience the end of samsara on the level of a life time. In the reality frame from which we now both view this webpage. Micro scale would be to experience the end of samsara during a meditation session. Let me give an example of ending samsara at micro scale. I am meditating on the feeling of my body which is reflecting mental effort. Then suddenly I find myself inside this story (my mind is wandering). The theme of the story is aligned with the bodily feeling that I was focusing on. The central theme is that I am trying to do something, I try to solve something like a mental puzzle. I am trying to do this inside a context which hosts a 3D environment, full of visual and other sensory perception, a memory and entire past, etc. So it looks like a life-time. Not 'my' life necessarily. I may even be in a complylety different role or life than the one I am currently experiencing. Now the crux is: when I come to realize what I am mentally doing, and that there is no need to do it, I let go. That moment the entire environment fades, or I stay there and be in control of keeping it alive (only for a while). Much like a lucid dream. I can choose to wake up out of it, or just enjoy the scenery while being freed from this mental strain. That what I was doing, comes forth from craving and desire and illusions. So the moment I realize myself and fully see what I am doing, I can let go. No moment earlier, because when I do not see fully what I am doing, and I would attempt to let go, I would fool myself. With that, the environment collapses or when I put effort in, I can keep it alive for a while. The thing is: I am freed from the mental strain. The reason I am relating all this to the cycle of birth and death is that: the entire environment, experience of self, the role I have there and what not, seems to be in function of self-reflecting. To find out what I am doing and learn about myself. And as soon as I let go, I die there. The environment goes away or I am no longer in the role that I was in. Now my understanding of ending Samsara from a Buddhism perspective is that it is described at the scope of a life-time. I am wondering, is there any literature that talks about ending samsara at a more micro scale level. Like the example experience I gave above? From my personal experience I come to the conclusion that there are too much similarities between the meditation experience described above and my life, that is likely for them to have their root in the same formula, only on a different scale, like a fractal pattern. 

Your Karma, good or bad, will depend on how you treat, raise, and teach your child. It is What you do with him/her, that will result in good/bad/neutral karma. Hence, by just bringing a child into the world, it is neither a good or bad karma, it is neutral. 

Karma will result from 'Intention' + 'Action'. basically, any action will form karma, and intention behind will increase the strength of karma. Intention itself will also cause Karma. Therefore: A) Karma will result. B) Karma will result. C) Karma will result. D) Karma will result. In Buddhism, there is no such thing as "Payment" of karma through guilt. You will experience the Karma (good or bad) as long as you created it. If you realized something you did was wrong, learn from it, refrain from repeating it, and do something about it if still possible. No one has a "say" about the strength of your karma, as Karma itself is a manifestation of natural universal laws. No one can tamper with universal laws. Not even the Gods. 

All relationships are subject to impermanence, just like all illusions. Also, the way you perceive a relationship, will always differ to the other person within that particular relationship. The relationship is merely 'true' only within your perception, which is also impermanent, just like an illusion. 

I'm convinced that I give meaning to whatever I perceive. Which either can make me suffer or happy. So I have seen that I create my own suffering. That state is reflected in my body (or bodies?). Objective reality holds no meaning it itself. The meaning arises the moment I interpret information. This insight came to me after meditation where I saw things arising from nothing. I could choose to stay in the nothingness by not interpreting, or observe, interpret and meaning arose. What buddhist topics are related to this phenomenon? 

From my experience, one can influence outcomes of whatever by using intent. This is investigated much currently by Thomas Campbell, which you can read about in this My big TOE book and see in his videos on YouTube. What I read from a Buddhist perspective ($URL$ the mind certainly plays a role in your own physical health. What about influencing that health of others? For example, when one of my kids has the flu, I wish them good health using meditation. I have no objective proof but it seems to speed up the recovery. My question is, what does Buddhism teach in using the mind to heal physical problems of others? And what about healing their mental problems through focused intent? I wish to have tagged this with 'mental', 'physical' and 'health' but those tags aren't available. 

The question is: How does Kamma associate with "provocation"? Example 1: A says to B "Hit/kill me if you dare." Example 2: A tells B that killing is justified if the cause is right. In the above examples, and if B did the hitting/killing after the provocation, who's kamma is worse? A or B? And Why? 

You can always build your "worldly success" while practicing Buddhism. There is no conflict of each other. If you are talking about go the monastic direction and live like a monk, that's a totally different story. 

Work is merely part of life, not all of it. Recognize that this current society is ruled by people who designed money, material, etc...which is why we have to work for money to ensure a certain quality of life and 'keep the wheel rolling'. Remember, work is merely a tool for income to support life. Instead of hating work, it is better to think of how you could spend your life and make it meaningful ! Through work and your job, it is merely your stepping stone to achieve a higher goal. Putting Buddhism teachings aside, a common reason why people do not like their job is mostly because of the people and work nature. Think about what's causing the trouble, and make suitable solutions for it. 

Ego is identification. Some thought experiment, that consider the option to have action without identification, may point it out: 

me (or the role that I play as a human being) my understanding of the current situation my imagination of a future possible situation that I (or better: we) gain from (as in win-win) (in balance with nature/life and my estimation of the effort to get there. 

You can imagine that if you would gain an abstract value of 10 (on a scale of 1-10) with an estimation of the required effort of value 1 (same scale). Then it is something you are willing to go for and thus feel motivated. On the other hand, if you estimate that the gain will be an abstract value of 1, and the estimation of effort value 10, then you are less motivated because of effort:gain ratio is much higher. And when you have doubt whether it is possible at all to get at that imagined, more beneficial, situation, you feel uncertainty and doubt. Which doesn't add to the motivation to go for it. So my state of being is independent of the environment and I simply feel positive/negative depending of the parameters that I get to choose to fill in whatever formula that I get to choose. Of course, I can only choose if I see choices. So knowing which emotions exist, understanding these emotions and formulas to execute to produce them are key here. Working on something that I am motivated for feels positive. Feeling thankful feels positive. The formula of thankfulness: 

If you have owned a pet bird before, you will understand the fact that birds cannot be enslaved in any ways. You can only tame a bird, not enslave. 

The cause to your biases, speculation, stereotyping, jumping to conclusions,.....are your strong attachments to Impermanence. To cure this, you must Recognize the "Nature of impermanence". Once you did, your biases, speculation, stereotyping....will cease to exist, for they are also impermanent. 

You will have to be very distinct whether your attachment is towards: 1. Your positive influence to the world; 2. Your reward, no matter big or small; 3. Your egotistic sense of success; and/or 4. Your self/improvement, enlightenment, etc. If you are towards 1-3, you are not achieving enlightenment. If you feel you are towards 4 but you are not reducing any suffering, you are not achieving enlightenment either. Remember, enlightenment is not just about letting go, but void of suffering. Are you following the 4 noble truths? and the 8 folds paths in what you do? And by the way, egoistic achievement is NOT necessary for progress in science and technology. You can say it is a motivation for some people, but it is not the only possible motivation. Therefore, the "individualistic roots" are neither permanent nor necessary.
