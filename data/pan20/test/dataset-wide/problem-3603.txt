Sounds like its your hip adductors, which consists of several muscles that make everything tick. In regards to doing "LOADS" of leg exercises, I see guys who do a lot of by-the-science strength training, but I also see a lot of guys hanging out on isolation machines doing various things. 

You can read up on fixing them here, and a lot of it comes down to strength training. The big compound barbell lifts like back squat, over head press, deadlift, and row will do magical things for your posture (and much else). I'd recommend checking out Starting Strength or Strong Lifts 5x5. Additionally, try not to fall into the "23/1 trap", where you have one hour a day of great training and then spend the rest of your day causing the same problems to your body that got you into the mess. Some other things that will make a big difference: 

The medical community and the public in general seems to regard strength training as a general voodoo practice that will "hurt you". Fortunately, this has been getting debunked soundly for over a decade now. 

If you want definition in your biceps, you need to train them like a body builder would: lots of isolation work, moderate to high rep range, and lots of volume. Personally I can't stand training that way and although I don't have studies in front of me to prove it, anecdotal I know it causes a lot of injuries. Isolation work is a terrific way to develop tendinitis and overuse injuries and imbalances. As you said you are strength training, so I would pick from strength training exercises. Specifically: 

A good barbell program like Strong Lifts 5x5. Starting Strength is great too, but if you like SL 5x5, go with it. Get to intermediate strength standards. Honestly, until you are at least intermediate in your physical strength, it's just sort of silly to focus on anything else. After you get to intermediate on all of the standards (maybe take out the clean, if you really want to), you have a terrificaly balanced training program, a lot of good habits, and a foundation to go into body building, strength competitions, or any form of general athletics. 

I google'd around a bit and found other folks talking about hamstring tendons sliding around on their femur, and the general approach seems to be stretch and strengthen, like normal. Those both worked fine for me and as a bonus the increased hamstring flexibility has really helped me lower my squat depth. 

There are a lot of gym rats who immediately opt for a body building and they are nearly always the same people a year later with chicken legs, blown out shoulders, and weak backs. 

I would recommend following a program. Unless you were an Olympic trainer in a past life, the reality is that other people (professional trainers and coaches) know what you should do more than you do. As such, follow the advice that has been laid out in advance, for free, by these professionals. So to answer your question directly, you should not only keep track of what you do but you should also be following a plan of exactly what to do. What exercises, how many times, how much force/weight, how much time, etc. I would recommend Starting Strength or Strong Lifts 5x5; there is no way you're going to have comparable results coming up with your own plan. Edit, I found an old training plan that I used for weeks on the Madcow 5x5 program (for intermediate lifters). For me I carried this around with a pen, and would make little notes about injuries, missed weights, etc. 

Nothing beats running of course, but it looks like you have to scratch that off your list entirely. You might want to give cycling a shot. With clipless pedals and shoes the force is delivered through the ball of your foot, not really at the toes. Also, you can drag the cleat back on the shoe that it's pretty far to the back of your ball. Very stiff shoes, generally for racing, should help to keep a lot of the load off of your toes. 

Ballistic forces (swinging) add a lot to the equation, but putting all of that aside it takes strength to hold onto a bar with all of your body weight. 

I wouldn't sweat the difference in weights you can do on one versus the other, there can be a lot of good reasons for that. The angles, range of motion, and muscle involvement all shift. On heavy barbell rows, despite your best efforts, your chest will drop a bit to meet the bar. On the lever machine, you can't get away with that. On a pure row, the weight is going to come up near-perfect vertically, versus on the lever machine it will track on whatever angle the lever is bolted into place. That last aspect alone, the angle your pulling, makes a big difference. StrongLifts 5x5 (I think) was adapted from the Bill Starr's famous 5x5 dating back to 1976. I know that's where Madcow 5x5 came from, and I assume the lifts for StrongLifts were chosen in a similar fashion. Either way, the original 5x5 (Bill Starr's) actually called for the power clean. Barbell rows were only substituted later because you can self-learn a barbell row but for cleans most people need training. I think it's safe to look at barbell rows, cleans, and lever rows as the "upper back pulling" part of a strength training program. I moved away from barbell rows personally because of the load on my lower back, which is already pretty high from the constant other-lower-back-demanding barbell loads. Once I got to around 225lb 5RM, I flipped to squat cleans and weighted pullups and never looked back. Barbell rows have put a lot of beef on people's backs, and deserve to be the primary upper back compound lift early on. But a lot of people move away from them for good reason, especially if you do a lot of squat/deads/cleans. 

It's also a great opportunity to focus on things like plyometrics and pistol squats. A lot of single leg stuff tends to not happen in a gym but you can use your gym-less time to work on mobility and strength on both sides of your body. 

The harm would be found in a lack of support for parts of your body (or another person's body) that needs support and doesn't benefit from getting tossed about as you run. Chafing is another issue, and a lot of runners will wear bandaids over their nipples to prevent bleeding and broken skin. A lot of folks with big legs wear slick shorts that cover at least the tops of their thighs, so that their hip adductors don't rub the skin raw. Jockstraps have been replaced largely by compression shorts, which for some people (like male Olympic weightlifters) is critical because you really don't want anything sticking out when the bar flies up across your pelvis. In short, if you can run without the need for protective gear, have fun. People who need support will wear clothes that provide it. 

The only time I can imagine this making sense is for warmups, rehab, or when trying to focus on a particular aspect of form. 

The stronger you get, the faster you'll be able to go. If you get to the point where you can do one-arm pullups or with 1/2 your bodyweight in plates hanging off you, a regular bodyweight pullup will need to be force-ably slowed down to keep yourself from whipping about. I wouldn't concentrate on any particular areas though. One of the great things with compound movements like that is that they're fairly natural, so your body will eventually do it with the appropriate amount of muscle activation. Your big muscles (lats, in particular) will handle most of the load and your smaller muscles will take a back seat, which is exactly how it's supposed to work. Go as fast as you can on the way up, but specifically on the downward (eccentric) side, make sure you don't drop like a stone. You want a controlled release so you don't shock load your arms. 

Interval training is very effective form of training because it's hard. So you were doing one of the harder forms of running and doing it a little harder then you normally do it, and then you started getting some pain from it. My history of competitive running, at least with my body, has shown me that training for running is essentially managing over-use injuries. If you could simply keep ratcheting up distance and speed forever at a constant rate, everyone would run sub 4 minute miles and hop around like gazelles. If I encountered what you did, I would do this: 

There are other areas where although not primarily an eccentric movement, there's a large eccentric component (ie: skull crushers and good mornings) where eccentric lengthening (and DOMS) is just going to be part of the movement. But barring those types of examples, I don't see why you'd purposefully rob yourself of pushing more weight by "training" your eccentric abilities more than are required for successfully performing the exercise. 

Perhaps, for someone completely de-conditioned who can exert such small amounts of force on their bodies that the recovery time is small. But in practical terms: no. 

That means you should be doing a full body routine, three days a week, hanging out in the 12 rep range. Each time you workout you should be hitting all major muscle groups, focusing on compound lifts. You should notice strength increases weekly, sometimes more frequently; in other words you should be regularly and gradually increasing your weights. Starting Strength by Mark Rippetoe is a program you'll see referenced a lot for good reason. So on your rest days, which is every other day, you can do whatever you like but make sure you're not adding a lot of physical stress. Yoga, light cardio, sports, and things of that nature are good. You definitely don't want to be sedentary (at all, ever), but don't steal the recovery time that your body needs. That type of discipline gets more important the stronger you get. A lot of people are on perpetual plateaus because they don't have a proper program that maximizes work effort and rest. 

You don't need to cycle on and off protein and amino acid supplementation. Again, you get protein and amino acids from normal food that you eat. 

The barbell row really is a terrific exercise right up until (for me) you start going over your bodyweight. So if you're 180lb, having 180lb's of bar+plates tends to be pretty heavy primarily because you're probably already doing a lot of other lower back exercises. A big advantage to barbell lifts (vs bodyweight) is that you can incrementally change your weights and really tweak the volume vs intensity vs reps vs sets. The angles stay nearly identical, versus what you're experiencing on your inverted (supine) row. With inverse rows your pull angle is changing as you move the bar up and down. Eventually, you will plateau strength with bodyweight training. Pistols squats are awesome, but your body only weighs so much and you get more efficient at doing them as you progress so they become easier. You can put a weighted vest or backpack on, but now that's not bodyweight training anymore. Boiled down, I'd recommend these points:
