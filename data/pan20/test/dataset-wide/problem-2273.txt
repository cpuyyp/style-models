Fuels tend to be prohibited on commercial flights, by definition. There are a variety of solid fuel stoves which are popular with bushcrafters and day campers although these tend to be relatively heavy and bulky and rely on you being able to find suitable fuel at your campsite. Their major downside is that they may not be allowed in some areas depending on local definitions of an 'open fire' and they are certainly not as convenient as most liquid or gas fired stoves. Multi-fuel stoves are a good option for this sort of problem as you can get ones which work with gasoline, diesel and kerosene eg the priumus omnifuel. These generally work very well and are light and convenient and you can get the fuel pretty much anywhere (although obtaining small quantities can sometimes be a problem). One downside is that if you use automotive fuel the smell tends to permeate everything and for obvious reasons gasoline needs to be handled with some care. Although the stoves which connect directly to the fuel bottle are a lot better in this respect. Any stove which works with gasoline should also work with naptha ie lighter fluid (expensive as stove fuel but easy to find) and in larger quantities it is used as panel wipe by automotive paint shops. Another option is alcohol. Something like a Trangia is very reliable and not at all expensive so even if it gets confiscated on the return flight its not too painful. The traditional trangia set is very bulky but all you really need is the burner, a cooking pot (or mug) and something to support it and you can get aftermarket lightweight supports and heat shields. In most places some suitable fuel is reasonably easy to obtain either as denatured ethanol (methylated spirits in some countries) or isopropanol (aka rubbing alcohol). 

In bushcraft and survival there are a range of tasks which a bladed tool can be used for. In the context of woodcraft and survival you are likely to be a lot more interested in making tools and implements, preparing wild food and game and generally extracting resources from your environment than in normal camping or trekking so basic and general purpose tools become more important in comparison to specialist equipment that you carry with you. The context of survival as opposed to woodcraft usually implies an unexpected emergency situation so it is often a case of using whatever you have available. Similarly a survival kit may is likely to be tight on space and weight. At this point it is well worth saying that there is no advantage at all in buying an expensive knife untill you have the experience to make an informed decision for yourself about what makes a good knife. Similarly the ability to sharpen a knife properly will give you vastly more practical benefit than one made from some exotic super steel. For actual survival a large chopping knife like a golok is likely to be of the most immediate use as it will make easier work of jobs like building a shelter and splitting kindling as well as being versatile enough for a range of scraping, carving and digging jobs and is adequate for carving tools and preparing game. Ideally this would be supplemented by a smaller knife better suited to fine tasks and it is also worth noting that large knives like this do need some care, forethought and practice to use safely (not that small knives don't) In my experience mid sized (5" - 14") knives tend to be a poor compromise being unwieldy for fine tasks and lacking the right balance to be useful for chopping. A viable alternative is a small woodsman's axe although here a bit more care is needed in selection as most common small axes and hatchets are intended only for splitting firewood and not that well adapted to a more general purpose role. As already mentioned it is better to invest time in learning to sharpen your tools properly than spend a fortune on expensive blades and similarly make sure that you keep a basic field sharpening kit with the tool, ceramic or diamond stones are a good lightweight solution. For relatively inexperienced users there is also a lot to be said for lightweight folding saws as they are intuitive and reasonably safe to use although they do need to be backed up by at least a small knife as they are useless for slicing type jobs (food prep, carving etc) Unless you are in a saltwater environment I would tend to recommend plain carbon steel over stainless for fixed blade knives as it is easier to sharpen and keep sharp and generally performs better. In most circumstances corrosion will not be anything other than a cosmetic issue. All else being equal a fixed blade knife will generally be cheaper and more reliable than a folding knife, having said that a knife which you have in your pocket because it is convenient to carry will be infinitely more useful than one which is in your drawer at home. For well stocked survival kit I would personally recommend a combination of 

There are a few distinct methods which require few or no tools. 1) Skewers : good for fish and small pieces of meat, especially more tender cuts which don;t require long cooking. simply thread the meat onto a sharpened green stick and support over the fire. Here a fire of hot embers with little or no flame works best. The larger scale version of this is spit roasting. 2) Cauldron : if you need to boil water or make soup or stew but don't have a metal cooking pot there are two techniques. Firstly A shallow bag made from leather or tightly woven canvas can, with care be used to boil water over a fire without burning as the water seeping through the material keeps it cool. The second method is to use any container which will hold water, even a natural hollow in a rock, fill it with water and place into it rocks heated in a fire. 3) Pit roasting/BBQ : this technique is still fairly widely used. You basically dig a pit, line it with rocks, light a fire, let it burn down to embers. Place your wrapped meat in the hole and bury. This can be an efficient way to cook large joints of meat. 4) Wrapping/steaming : wrap the meat well in leaves, seaweed and or/clay and place on hot embers, this will steam the food and works well with fish. Directly wrapping in clay can also peel off feathers, scales or spines and so save on some preparation time (results may vary) . 5) Ovens : if you have a bit more time you could make a simple oven from clay or stones. This is essentially a hollow which you light a fire inside alloy it to burn down and then rake or sweep out the ashes and place your food inside. 6) Hot rocks : you can fry food which only needs quick cooking such simply by laying it on reasonably flat smooth rocks heated in a fire. 7) Direct cooking : some things like shellfish, thick skinned roots and tubers and even some cuts of meat can be cooked by placing directly onto embers. 8) Hot smoking : still widely practiced, involves cooking food in the hot gasses from a low fire 9) Air drying : in some environments food can be cured simply by cutting into thin strips and letting it dry in the wind. Points to note. In most circumstances the best way to cook it with a fire which is burned down to a good bed of embers with little or no flame or by indirect heat such as heated rocks. This provides a much more controlled and consistent heat than an open flame. In some cases this may require having separate fires for cooking and heat light, or you can always transfer embers from your main fire to a separate cooking area. Take care when cooking that the fuel and any plant material used for wrapping, skewering food etc is not poisonous. Some types of rocks can explode when heated, this is a whole separate subject but in general avoid flints or stones taken from a river bed. 

As an aside it is also worth mentioning the Buffalo sleeping system as this inherently works well with bivi bags as it is a lot less sensitive to getting wet than most other sleeping bags although it is a not to everybody's taste and doesn't compress as well as lofted insulation. 

In the US you probably won't be able to become an apprentice in the traditional sense at the age of 14 as you will be legally obliged to be in school or at least educated by someone with parental responsibility. Similarly it is not usually possible to employ minors except for casual work with very few hours. There is also the fact that in the modern world a falconer is not someone retained by a feudal lord with a job for life so they are running a business and won't have a lot of spare time to train people for free, especially as even unpaid employees may attract all sorts of extra costs in terms in insurance liability etc. Having said that I wouldn't want to put you off from something which has genuinely inspired you. I would suggest that you learn as much as you can about the subject via books and the internet (don't forget books). Also find out of there are any falconers local to you, many carefree will be very happy to help young enthusiasts as far as they can, especially if they can show that they really do care about the subject. Here you may need to be gently persistent but I would be surprised if you can't find a master falconer who doesn't respond well to genuine enthusiasm. As you are 14 you will also need to get your parents/guardians on side as they will probably need to give permission for any training you can get ect and you may need to demonstrate that you can handle your schoolwork at the same time. Bear in mind that traditional apprenticeships always included a lot of dull tedious work so you need to be ready for that in one form or another either directly or indirectly. 

In addition to personal equipment appropriate to the terrain and conditions there are some rescue specific basics which should be easy to provide, this is more geared to providing support to the main search and rescue effort than actually going out at the sharp end yourself. Obviously a lot of search and rescue kit and training is quite specific but the support logistics are more generic and can be just as important : 

Fully inflatable mattresses don't provide a great deal of insulation from the ground and tend to be fairly heavy plus they take a bit of effort to inflate and deflate which can become a nuisance if you are moving camp every day, especially in bad weather. A closed cell foam pad is inexpensive, rugged and provides good insulation for light weight. Their main downsides are that they don't compress much and are rather bulky and take up a significant amount of space. Also being fairly thin and firm they don't do much for comfort on hard or lumpy surfaces. The self inflating mats are a lot more compact than closed cell ones for a similar levels of performance while still being fairly easy to set up. They also tend to be a bit softer and thicker for the same weight and so may feel more comfortable, plus you can get extra thick ones, albeit with a corresponding increase in weight and bulk. Like fully inflatable ones they can be punctured. Overall inflatable air mattresses aren't that well suited to backpacking. The choice between self-inflating and closed cell option really comes down to a compromise between price, durability and pack size which ultimately depends on your own personal priorities and the conditions you expect to encounter. If you are unsure then a a basic closed cell foam mat is a pretty safe bet
