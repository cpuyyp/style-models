No, this is not classified information. There have been plenty of descriptions of the timeline to launch US nuclear weapons, most much more detailed than anything Secretary Clinton said, and none of the people publishing them have been prosecuted. Also the articles giving those details are still easily available, and have been for years, indicating that the US military does not see any problem with them being published. Here are some examples: 

Sticking anything into an ear, for the purpose of cleaning it or otherwise, is dangerous and can result in ruptured eardrums as well as other damage. My doctor said "nothing should be inserted into an ear that is smaller than an elbow". Ear wax does indeed come out naturally. Mostly, but not always. If your earwax doesn't come out naturally, then the issues above still mean you shouldn't clean out your ears yourself (or get any unskilled person to do it). Your doctor will clean your ears using a syringe technique. You can help it out by putting mineral oil, or olive oil, in the ear, which softens the wax. 

Other researchers conducted a similar survey (obtining compatible figures) and then checked on the credibility of the reports: 

Doctors do always tell you to finish your course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. The reason for this is that you feel better before all the bacteria are killed within you body. If you stop the treatment early, the bacteria will start to grow again and the infection will recur. It is also likely that the second attack will consist of bacteria with more immunity to the antibiotic (the ones without any resistance were killed, right?) and so will be worse. However there are other reasons apart from the immunity issue. Here is a good article on the subject. And another. And another. And another. Other factors also contribute to the rise of antibiotic-immune bacteria, including the overuse of antibiotics for minor illnesses. You edited to ask if bacteria "become immune" to the antibiotics. Its not clear what you mean by "become immune" but the answer is still probably "yes". The second wave attack by resistant bacteria is due to two effect. Selection is the primary one. Some of the bacteria in the infection are more resistant to your prescribed antibiotic than others. A partial course removes the bacteria that have low resistance and leaves those with high resistance, which form the 'second wave' infection that results from stopping the course early. In that case those bacteria are not "becoming resistant", it's just that the resistant ones predominate. However it is also true that mutations can and do occur, and this can result in bacteria that previously had low resistance becoming highly resistant. In that sense bacteria sometimes are "becoming resistant". This paper gives more information. 

By appropriately expanding the definition of "fly" (or by choosing to believe some undocumented and implausible claims) you can make a case for some of the other pioneers. But the Wrights undoubtedly have the best documented and most credible case for being the first to fly. 

Now the trend is much less pronounced, but still detectable (especially if you consider Israel a special case, given its ongoing conflict). Without Israel there are certainly few countries with low gun ownership and high gun homicide. And it's probably worth restating that the US has rates of both gun ownership and gun homicide more than double any other country on that chart. EDIT: I haven't been able to make a chart, but the figures for all homicides (more than just gun-related) follow a similar pattern to gun-related homicides. The US has double the homicide rate of the next highest country in the OECD, and four times the rate of most (with the strange exception of Luxembourg, whose homicide rate is very slightly higher than half the US). EDIT:Several people commented that the questions was asking about violent crime, not just homicide. I found what look like reasonable figures for assaults at Nationmaster Encyclopedia . Plotting those against gun ownership gives this graph: 

Firework displays can be a hazard to aircraft. Sufficiently large firework displays are notified to aircraft operators through NOTAMs. The Canadian NOTAM Manual contains a specific section on fireworks and pyrotechnics (Section 5.5.10). Some displays may result in the establishment of restricted airspace, which would compel aircraft to route around it. Aircraft may also choose to avoid areas in which firework displays are happening. However as Ryathal says, fireworks are in general forbidden near airports, and airliners cruise too high to be affected by regular firework displays. The NOTAMs mentioned above are more likely to affect smaller unscheduled aircraft. There might also be occasional suspensions of operation like the Manchester one described by him. 

While there have certainly been stories widely reported in the news that turned out to be untrue, this doesn't read like one of them. The key is the entry on the Verizon security blog. Whereas 'urban legend' stories are usually short on specifics, and often cite unnamed 'friends of friends', the Verizon report claims that it was actually them who dealt with this incident. It is entirely understandable that they don't name either the person or the company. Given the widespread attention given this story it is highly likely that Verizon would have taken this story down if it had been a prank or an early April Fool. The poster is named (another thing that tends not to happen with urban legends) and exists and is a security professional according to this and this. He claims that he has personal knowledge of the incident - something that would probably get him fired if Verizon knew he was lying. According to several reports he spoke to ABC News about it. Some reports have details that are not in the original security blog. All in all I see no reason to doubt the truth of this. 

Inside virtually every phone charger is a transformer. Transformers have a finite resistance, and hence there will always be current flowing through them if they are plugged in, even if there is no load (i.e. nothing charging). That's basic physics. But the obvious follow-up question is: how much energy does it use? Estimates vary, but its certainly not much. This article claims (without reference) that its 1-5 watts. This page claims that it's less than half of a watt. And further claims that this represents one hundredth of a percent of a typical person's usage. This article gives more figures for different standbys, and gives that for a phone charger at about 0.4W. You can consume that power for 380 days to get the same amount of energy as a hot bath. Of course with very many people using phone chargers, that can add up to a very large amount of electricity. 

TL;DR Essentially, there is no conflict. Here is a pretty normal summary of major events in the universe. Here is another. And another. There are some discrepancies, but given the level of uncertainty we have in the timing of these events, nothing that is a major disagreement. However it should be said that the events listed are not explicitly mentioned in the Bible. The article is more of a reconciliation of the scientific description with the Biblical story. I would quote from the references, but I would end up having to quote much of each reference to show agreement. Instead it is left as an exercise for the reader. 

Again Mexico is the exception, but so is the US. It has a much higher level of gun ownership and gun homicide than any of the other countries. So much so that it obscures any trends in the graph. Let's replot without those two countries. 

It is well known that Nelson Mandela was involved with the formation of MK, the armed resistance wing of the ANC. However the organization was set up primarily to sabotage rather than to kill. As the campaign escalated people were killed by MK - as many as 63, with more than 400 injured. For comparison it should be remembered that this actions was a revolution against a deeply repressive regime, which had killed 69 people, more than the entire MK campaign, in a single incident at Sharpeville. It is certain that many fewer people were killed by MK than there were civilians killed by the Patriot side in the American War of Independence. The suggestion that 63 deaths amounts to 'genocide' under these circumstances is ridiculous. There is no indication that Mandela was directly responsible for any of these deaths. Even when he was prosecuted by the Apartheid regime, the charges were "sabotage, ordering munitions, recruiting young men for guerrilla warfare, encouraging invasion for foreign military units, and conspiring to obtain funds for revolution from foreign states", but not murder. Nelson Mandela did indeed receive support from countries to which the USA was opposed. The US was at the time providing substantial support to the Apartheid regime, and had condemned the ANC as a terrorist organization. Mandela was convicted at his trial of 'statutory communism'. Communism is defined there as: 

In other words, it's not a defence to simply say "I don't have the key". You are presumed to have the key unless you can provide some evidence (not necessarily proof) that you don't have it. (With apologies to @Konrad Rudolph, who originally held this view and I disagreed with him) With that single exception, nothing else in the law appears to override the basic legal principle that you have to be shown to be guilty in a court of law. The police have to show that there is encrypted data in order to show that you failed to provide a key to it. If you have (unencrypted) astronomical data on your laptop, then the burden of proof would still be on the police to show that it was encrypted data. And anyway, the case would still be tried in a court of law. The police can no more send you to jail because they think you have encrypted data than because they think you committed a murder. A court can send you to jail if it can be proved that you have encrypted data, you refuse to disclose the key, and you can't show that you don't have the key. To answer the question at the end: No you cannot be put in jail just because the police think you have encrypted data.
