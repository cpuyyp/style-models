That being said, the basic premise that will provide the basic entrance into this question can be stated another way, "There is no independently existing thing called you, yourself, or your life". And beginning there, we can immediately see aspects of truth in this. Thoughts we have repeated to ourselves for decades have nothing in common with reality. If I tell myself "I'm no good" every time I fail, then I will come to believe that there is an 'I' that failed, and that 'I' has has a property called I'm no good, and that property then becomes a plausible explanation for the failure. Over time, the existence of the property gains form and mass, and becomes more and more certain. However: the 'I' that 'is no good' can only exist with the support of the properties that construct it. Before 'I'm no good, the 'I' simply is, and empty of content, it is likewise formless - rootless. There is no true you underneath the you that is constructed by repeated habits, constant dialogue, internal chatter, and unawareness. To put it another way - if there is a you, then the you or I is the space that gives rise to properties as possibilities - that can create 'I'm no good'. That space, as space, has no existence independently in the universe. The space that you are is neither separate from, nor distinct from the space that you are not. The mind - which is also not divided - but appears to be - is not separate from anything else (though our experience of the mind is that it is within us) - the wall in front of us cannot exist as it exists without us standing before it and perceiving it. Does that mean that if I leave, the wall ceases to exist? That is the type of thinking that traps us in duality. The wall is not separate from you, nor you from the universe - so how can it not exist - and how can you leave? Where would you go? Everything I'm writing here is merely like a sculptor's hammer. I don't know you, and I am unable to offer you anything that would speak directly to your concerns without knowing them. However, imagine I am offering you that you can use to knock on the door of your own understanding. Since everything is right here, quoting , 

What is powerful; what is extraordinary; what is beyond measure is to be aware of identification as it arises. I've played some powerful games in life; some ridiculously competitive games that bestow upon the winner the admiration of the spectators. There are basically three ways to deal with winning a game like this inside the context of dis-identification. 

Note: I am aware that this response jumps around. I was looking to capture the space of several points rather than promoting a well-founded point of view. 

Don't get attached to the peace of mind part. Mindfulness that is overly self-conscious will leave you attached to being 'good at concentrating' or something. Open yourself to your task and the environment within which the task exists - let the outward expression of joy you find in your practice be a gift to those who are near. 

Don't be an idiot - There is a tiger in the field in front of you if you see him. Do not chase him to prove that he doesn't exist. Don't rule out anything - While not being an idiot, also allow your mind to venture far beyond what you consider to be possible or true; and don't get attached to anything you come up with. A quote from Dogen(I think) sums this up well: 

While what I will suggest here isn't the TRUTH, it's a possible place to stand. The ego tends to think it has improved when gaining insight into one's own self-deception. And this is valid - if there were no short term accomplishments in a spiritual path, it would be a difficult path indeed. However, it's this very sort of of short term gain that can inhibit spiritual growth. We are prone to gain a greater sense of self-importance when proud or attached to our insights. Yesterday's insight is today's ego trip. My point is that given we are all - when measured against the background of who we really are - quite small; I think it would be safe to assume that yes - you were lying with no caveats. That said, you are not now condemned eternally for your self deception, but it may be that you now feel obligated to make something right - to clean up actions you have taken in the past. Taking it too an extreme example - I killed your dog yesterday, because I thought dogs were wicked. Today, I realized that I suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and as such, I now know that dogs are not wicked. It doesn't follow that I didn't kill your dog. I still did, and even though my reasons for doing so were based upon faulty assumptions - there are a whole slew of consequences that flow from my action. But perhaps most importantly is the label you have attached to what happened. We as humans unfailingly deceive nearly every time we open our mouth. When I say to my wife, "You make me so mad", that is a lie. She didn't make me mad - I had a reaction to something and chose to blame her. Variations on this abound. So - a question - what do you care if your statement was a lie or not? Telling the truth won't make you a good person; nor lying a bad. What matters is not how you choose to view what you said - what matters is what you might now need to do because of what you said. If there were consequences that you can in some way be responsible for and if need be, clean up, then it would be wise to do so. 

... Then you will harm people while not intending to do so. As far as I can see, there are two points of access for what you seek to accomplish. 

Short answer: You cannot. Longer answer: You really, really can't. You can't even really see how much you are unconscious in the present, and you and I are considerably more unconscious that we'd care to be aware of. Awareness of unawareness is itself awareness. 

Siddhartha by Herman Hesse is an excellent book and is written with the spirit of mystery and wonder that also permeates most Buddhist teachings. 

Did Buddha speak about the duration of lives in any way that related it to where one currently stands on the path? For example: "When one is closer to enlightenment, one will have shorter lives after each successive rebirth." This wouldn't make a lot of sense when following the literal doctrine of Rebirth, but maybe it would make sense as a metaphor. At any rate - is anything like this idea touched upon in the sutras? 

I suggest throughout your path of forgiveness, you keep the spirit of that quote in front of you. When you try and bulldoze through upsets and constantly overcome emotional setbacks, it's easy to get swept up in the mess of thoughts and feelings - and easy also perhaps to stop caring; or to lose sight of the spiritual possibility that gives you power to face what frightens you. I find that if I treat my upsets as an opportunity for awareness and awakening, I have much more power in traversing the dangerous territory of the mind. For now, I will refer to you as two - I will say it when referring to your mind ( to MIND ) and you when referring to possibility of being who you really are ( to SELF ). It is nasty. It will attempt in many insidious ways to sabatoge your goal. You wish to forgive, and it will do what it can to try and make sure that doesn't happen. Your goal is forgiveness. It's goal is survival. It will attempt to protect you from getting hurt again using whatever resources it can. It does not want you to be free. It wants you to be safe. You may find that yourself in an argument with your husband about something totally unrelated to the infidelity - and it will start chattering away. "Well what does he know anyway? He cheated. Why do I even trust him? He might be lying to me right now." If every time thoughts like that arise, you try and suppress them; overcome them; or the like, you will lose the opportunity of awareness. What will give you freedom is if you can find a way to give space to those thoughts without succombing to them or trying to overcome them. If you can just let them be, they will lose their potency and your awareness will expand. You might also find it thinking negative thoughts about you. "I'm such a fool. He doesn't even love me. Why am I forgiving him?" It is the same thing, the target is just reversed. If you deal with these thoughts as the TRUTH - you will be trapped, a helpless victim of it's whims and fancies. However if you permit these thoughts to exist; recognize them for what they are; and allow them to be - as it talking - then you will gain freedom. The more space you have for what you consider to be the worst parts of yourself - the more your awareness will expand - and forgiveness will stop being the right thing to do or a good idea and become a natural freeflowing expression of your Self. It is very difficult. From my perspective, infidelity is one of the most difficult upsets, because the emotions that get triggered tend to be the most primal and the most deeply rooted. If, however, you find a way to give yourself space - not once, but repeatedly - then this can become a most transformative experience. The last bit I have to offer is this: You chose to forgive. You didn't have to choose that, and many people don't - and I suspect the majority of people who do don't have the awareness to confront it head on as you are. Your word given freely has a great deal of power. If you relate to your word as a sacred promise independent of any emotional state or discomfort you feel, this too can help you guide yourself. As you chose this freely, you get to be the author of your destiny; not a victim who is at the effect of something or a bystander watching your emotions overcome you. Because you said, "I choose to forgive", that is solid ground you can stand on. That is you. It would not say that. 

To really get that. To own that, and make it part of you - it allows for pure wonder. You can discover how ridiculously little you listen. Mostly we defend our lack of listening - trying to prove that we were listening - at least as best we could. If you take the case that you are not listening from the start - there is nothing to defend. What becomes possible is discovering the barriers between you and listening - and there are literally millions of them (e.g. They said something that reminded you of something you had to do; Something in what they said threatened you; You want them to like you; ad infinitum). Once there is awareness of an obstruction - the obstruction loses its grip. What is present in the absence of the barriers to listening is listening. It is not something done - it is something that arises in the absence of obstruction. 

When one is undertaking Buddhist practices, one is already doing something that will further their growth. If one reaches the point where what is between him and the next level of awakening is to discontinue intoxicants, he will know that before he could learn it from a precept. But if one must first eradicate all desires and sensory pleasures before undertaking the journey, the journey will be a short one indeed - the journey before the journey will be the journey. Buddhism is both dogmatic and non-dogmatic. It's dogmatic nature can give rise to deep spiritual discipline when practiced with rigor at a very high level - but as with any dogma - it can strangle practitioners - confuse them into clinging to their own understanding of an interpretation rather than opening themselves to a larger context. It is easy to see the non-dogmatic aspects in Buddhism - as stated here by Venerable Sumedho: 

is a great starting point for thinking. The great thing about this is that the thinking that follows from this premise works like a diamond drill, chiseling through years of accumulated morass. In other words, anyone can get themselves into this inquiry and roll it around in their mind; inspect it; test it; poke holes in it; and basically just look at it - and in thinking on this phrase, you will find yourself opening up. Just using it as a tool to stimulate thinking can teach you how to think and open you up to different insights. It is the perfect "koan" for a person at any level of experience and practice. There are two guides that help for thinking about this - in a way they represent polar extremes of the spaces people often go through when considering notions like this: 

Does anyone know what Hesse intended us to derive from this sequence? Specifically, has he spoken upon this issue, or written about it? It's always been completely mysterious to me. I'm looking for something more solid than unverified speculation. I'm not opposed to opinions, but I'd like that any opinion be informed by some source - either Hesse, or another writing about Hesse's works. 

Authentic listening grants freedom. Here is your access to listening: Notice where you don't. I once received the following (it was given with that label): 

So, there is time for meditation. There are no distractions that you deal with that are bigger than the distractions the millions of people who meditate deal with. What it takes to meditate is to be willing to listen to the chatter in your head and to see it for what it is. It is not you! It is just noise. There is nothing that happens in your mind that requires immediate action. All there is to do when meditating is to give space to the noise; to observe the noise without becoming the noise. Thoughts are just that; thoughts. What you will also find is that the moment you sit to meditate, your mind is suddenly a buzz with things you have to do. You will notice yourself becoming overwhelmed with concerns about incomplete projects, promises un-kept, dreams unfulfilled, things you have to do today, etc. All there is to do is to let the thoughts be...and eventually...they will let you be. 

First - this is a question directed towards advanced practitioners of mindfulness or similar meditation. I have been meditating and practicing other transformational work for about 17 years. Throughout the work, I've had many peak experiences, many "aha" moments, and I've experienced the deepening and expansiveness of my awareness and understanding. I've learned to be suspicious of any type of insight or experience that presents itself as "the answer" - in other words; I've had thoughts like "this is finally it! I got it!" So many times that I pretty much ignore that type of noise as soon as notice it. Lately while meditating, I've become increasingly aware of physical sensations (neither pleasant or unpleasant) in my body, particularly around my upper chakras; and the overall - for lack of a better word - intensity of my experience is elevated. As I allude to - I've never had a transformational experience that I considered "real" that came about with a bang - the worthwhile experiences are usually quite subtle - if fact my sense is that the essence of transformation is increasingly subtle rather than the other way around. My question is, what do I make of my recent experiences? It carries with it an intensity that seems well, intense. I recognize that more information is probably necessary to answer this; but in general terms, is this par for the course? Is it just something to notice, and let pass? Is it a symptom of something and/or, is there anything to do about it?
