You can download the data from the CRU-NCEP database $URL$ CRU stand for Climate Research Unit and it has the most accurate historical data available to the public. They are reanalyzed data from meteorological stations and ships. The highest resolution available is 0.5 latitude * 0.5 longitude degree grid. And for temporal resolution they have 6-hourly and daily. The data is in NetCDF format which is a format most map processing data use. If you don't know how to handle ncdf you could use Google Earth as well $URL$ . To know more how the data is derived you can read this paper. Hope it helps. $URL$ 

I think Wikipedia explains quite well. It is the wind that transport the airborne water droplets from a nearby showering cloud. It is quite common in UK especially near the coast which is often very windy. Usually the weather forecast will say that it has scattered shower with sunny spell. $URL$

Technically the depth is distance below the ocean floor, but bear in mind that unless there happens to be a cluster of seismometers close to the earthquake (unlikely in the ocean environment), the accuracy of depth estimates is only approximate. If you look at the table of earthquake depths in, for example, the Tonga Trench, you will see a few really deep earthquakes and many times more 'shallow earthquakes' at a nominal depth of 10 km - meaning 'shallow-ish'. 

The Laplace equation, (d^2 Ψ)/(dx^2 )+(d^2 Ψ)/(dy^2 )+(d^2 Ψ)/(dz^2 )=0, is just a steady state 3D flow equation. It's a black box conservation of hydraulic potential. Diffusion doesn't come into it. The Diffusion equation (assuming homogeneous isotropic conditions) is (∂^2 Ψ)/(∂x^2)+(∂^2Ψ)/(∂y^2)+(∂^2 Ψ)/(∂z^2)= S_s/K ∂h/∂t. This discretizes the time element, and is very much dependent upon the diffusive properties of the aquifer. Note that S_s/K is the reciprocal of the 'hydraulic diffusivity', hence the name of the equation. 

I guess nobody has given DJ Sims the simple answer he/she wants because such a generalized question is indeterminate. The chlorine is relatively stable, so 'how many ozone mols are destroyed' depends upon the availability of relatively short-lived ozone. In a dry atmosphere this is very much a function of temperature. At -50 deg C ozone's half life is about 3 months, but at 0 deg C it is only about 5 days. It also depends upon humidity, pH and a swag of associated high-atmospheric reactions. The ozone availability is also a function of ozone's regeneration rate. 

There are many universities and institutions that offer free online course nowadays. They are taught by world-famous leader in the field of the subject. I recently attend this course offer by University of Exeter on Climate change. It is very easy to follow and there is homework and test to do $URL$ People can get a certificate after they complete the course. I recommend you to watch documentary about climate change and read some science magazine which has the latest development on climatology. Visit a science museum and attend some open lectures will definitely help. In terms of career, you could do a PhD in climate science which has a strong element in biology and ecology in terms of Earth system modeling. This is a email subscription that send you regular advertisement on PhD positions and relevant jobs. $URL$ Computer programming and data visualization are very important skills you need for climatology. So maybe some courses on how to use R, Python, Matlab, Fortran would also be useful. Hope this helps. 

I would bet that Bon and Tbb are both 'spot on'. The hardness, black colour, conchoidal fracture and sharp edges are all typical of obsidian. Many obsidians are smokey to bottle green in transmitted light. Also, the location of northeast Anatolia is another giveaway. Obsidian is a glass that devitrifies over time, so we only find it in areas of relatively recent volcanic activity. Northeast Anatolia is indeed noted for its historic volcanism. Nemrut, in eastern Turkey is the most famous volcano, erupting as recently as 1441, and is known to produce obsidian. There are also a few other smaller volcanic centres in the region, any of which could contain some obsidian. Those with an eye for geological detail may be able to spot the most obvious on Google Earth. Hint - there is a line of at least 5 volcanoes between western Lake Van and Mount Ararat in Armenia. There are others, mostly less obvious, further north in Eastern Turkey. 

NVZ is correct. Get a palaeo-geographical atlas and see how the the distribution of the continents has changed over time. There is much more ocean than land, and it has ever been so, but there is no particular pattern to the way the continents have drifted. It's not quite random because the heat distribution in the mantle isn't random, but given the conveyor belt system of plate tectonics there will always be a tendency for crustal plates to clump together before breaking up and then clumping together somewhere else. 

It depends on your data, if the rainfall data is in a grid with temporal and spatial dimension, you can use a NetCDF format to analyse the data via R, matlab, IDL or Python. NetCDF is Network Common Data Form, which is a very common format of grided and temporal data. In Python, you can simply do several 10-year average map to see the long term decadal trend. Or you could plot a transient period of a smaller region with average rainfall to see monthly or seasonally change. To find out the intensity of distribution you could plot a map with a logarithmic scale of colour. Use a threshold to identify extreme rainfall event that is above the threshold. I use a Python package called iris which can easily plot graphs using NetCDF data. You can look at some examples here $URL$ For getting the rainfall data, you can download the rainfall data from the CRU-NCEP database $URL$ CRU stand for Climate Research Unit and it has the most accurate historical data available to the public.

User 32214, I suggest you draw back from Texas, disregard local weather anomalies (which don't count for much), and look at the bigger picture. Major seasonal changes in the heat distribution occur by three main processes. By far the most important is day length / relative accumulation of solar energy caused by the way the Earth's spin is inclined to the plane of orbit of the planet. This yields the normal seasonal variation. In addition, Hadley cells redistribute tropical heat polewards, whilst continental-scale (and larger) loops in the various jet streams bring thermal anomalies on a scale of weeks or even months. These processes bring inter-annual variations in the climate at any given location. Jet stream meteorology is rather complex, but a good summary is found in the clip: $URL$ The effect of climate change is to push extra heat polewards. This reduces the thermal gradient between either side of the polar jet stream, thus making the jet more sluggish in its migration around the world. This sluggishness causes the jet to slow, and create north-south loops, yielding extra cold anomalies on the cold side, and extra hot anomalies on the equatorial side. These account for record breaking hot and cold anomalies in North India, Moscow, Western Europe, and maybe Texas (though I am not familiar with Texan weather systems). So the short answer to your question is in two parts. Firstly, there is the major annual shift in climate due to the Earth's spin angle relative to the sun. Second, less important, but more interesting is the that climate change is very slightly beginning to alter the heat distribution of the planet. Or, you can adopt Donald Trump's 'science-free' head in the sand policy, in which case any climatic trend is a total mystery! Recently we have seen a rather odd scenario developing, in which the polar and subtropical jet streams have been merging. These are normally very different and distinct. Maybe this is a one-off anomaly, or maybe we are entering uncharted territory, where it will be harder to predict hot and cold spells - at least until we get a better handle upon how climate change will influence future jet streams. PS another factor is the annual oscillation of the inter-tropical convergence zone, but I suspect Texas is too far north to be involved in that process.
