Considering your digestive tract makes up a huge portion of your immune system, it might since active cultures help promote better intestinal health. The problem with this supplement is that it provides a tiny amount of active cultures. From Amazon: 

This is a very good answer on the effects and theories on the purpose of sleep. Some interesting tidbits: 

Other causes If you do not have Gynecomastia then reducing your bodyfat and developing your pecs will change their shape. Don't get me wrong, you can't change how the actual muscle looks beyond making it bigger/smaller but the combination of muscle development/bodyfat does give it a different appearance. 

Furthermore, a lot of joint problems come from muscle weakness or imbalance and improper movement mechanics. If you are having joint problems then you want to make sure to address any flexibility or mobility issues in the joints. Improve muscle strength and balance. Reduce sedentariness and avoid any painful activities. For shin splints, improving ankle mobility, calf flexibility and hip activation (Specifically the hip rotators like glute medius) should help. Make sure you aren't ramping up your training load too quickly - tendons, same as muscles improve their capacity over time. From the book Human Anatomy on exercise and cartilage 

Probably a bunch of other stuff like poor form and poor flexibility/mobility. It sounds like you just started exercising so I recommend developing a slow and steady pace. Fitness is more like a marathon, it happens over many weeks, months and years. Push yourself but within reason and vary up your training, sounds like you are doing very repetitive movements. 

Toning up doesn't exist. Also starvation mode doesn't exist. They are both mainstream concepts that vary in definition and include a wide range of different ideas. Your metabolism is crawling right now though because you are severely under-eating and things will only get worse if you don't make sensible changes. What you are trying to do is improve your body composition i.e Gain muscle; Lose fat. I don't know how severely underweight you are since I don't know your height, but what is clear is that: You are underweight Let that sink in a bit. So having established that it's clear you DO NOT need to lose weight. Instead you want to develop a physique, such as the gentleman below. 

Instead you want your elbows to at more of a neutral angle, not too flared but also not too tucked in. If your elbows are really tucked in you will shift the focus more on your triceps. The fingers aren't that important, what's more important is your wrist. You want that to be as straight as possible. Videos: Long Explanation on overall push up form. Quick push up form demonstration. 

It's not just protein that will keep you full for longer but also fat and fibre (vegetables/whole grains). Which is why the best breakfast I find has some combination of eggs and veggies. I would strongly recommend against eating some kind of breakfast sandwich from a restaurant/cafeteria although a homemade sandwich is great. I also recommend staying away from cereals since they aren't satiating and offer a poor macro split. Here are some balanced breakfast ideas: 

There definitely is a danger of overheating but that's really inherit with saunas in general. You can avoid that by waiting some time between your workout and going into the sauna. In between you can take a cold shower/bath to cool off further. As for muscle recovery, there are a lot of methods different people employ. Most of it has to do with cold rather than heat such as: 

The deadlift isn't really a super-specialized movement and your deadlift max is going to be governed by a combination of things: core stability, hip and leg strength, grip, etc. If you continue strength training, eating at maintenance or more, and get good recovery your deadlift is unlikely to fall behind. Even if it does, after a few sessions you'll be back at 100% or more. Here are some strategies to maximize your Squat and Deadlift gains. 

The only way to lose fat in a sustainable way is to change your habits and behavior. Diet isn't the answer because it's temporary. What do you do after you finished your Atkins regiment? Go back to how you used to eat and gain all the weight back. So this means you have to address your immediate environment and behavior in everyday life. Not be in an artificial and alien environment where you don't have stress, food is catered to you, and your entire day is structured and restricted. Sure you learn how to do better in a fat loss resort. But you do not live in a fatloss resort. Forgot the fantasy Television is television. It's not real. Make your own retreat. Have your SO take a 12 week break from work and start structuring her lifestyle so that she can lose fat. If she can't do it at home, she can't do it anywhere. Only then you won't be further $40,000 in debt. Here's how you can actually help Stop spending your money and start spending your time. People love to buy products and try to just throw their credit cards at their problems. That doesn't work. Spend time with your SO and help her establish better habits: 

I also find the goblet squat much easier on the back than the back squat. You can also try doing the leg press although you have to be very careful since it is possible to load the spine if you go too deep or your hips start to come off the bench. Overall I recommend getting physical therapy and getting specific advice from a sports medicine doctor. 

Overtraining is a chronic problem. The best indicator for overtraining is your progress in the gym. It's not possible to be overtrained while making good progress. The first symptom you describe is perfectly normal after an intense workout. Just make sure to hydrate, drink a post-workout shake (Protein + Carbs), rest and you should feel fine within an hour or so. Your second symptom doesn't seem connected to training. A lot of people have trouble sleeping for a variety of reasons. Just because you can't sleep doesn't mean it's a direct symptom of overtraining. Overtraining isn't a specific medical condition, instead it's an umbrella term that describes various symptoms related to exercising too much -in relation to other factors like calorie, protein, sleep, stress levels etc. 

Jim, as most people are, is pretty sedentary but lets assume he's pretty active and give him a ~1.5 calorie multiplier. Which means he needs 2550 calories to maintain his weight. But Jim wants to GO-MAD! So he adds a ~2450 daily calorie surplus to his diet because hell he wants to get results quick. So lets assume to add 1lb of muscle you need 2500 calories. Lets also assume you can gain 1lb of muscle per week. Both 'estimates' are extremely optimistic. So in order to gain 1lb of muscle per week Jim has to eat a weekly surplus of 2500 calories, which translates into 357 calories per day or ~2900 calories. Instead Jim is doing 5000, which means he's eating an extra 2000 calories on top of what he needs to gain 1lb of muscle a week! Or an extra ~14000 calories per week. Which translates into a nice 4lbs of fat per week. Comparing this against the hypothesis "GOMAD, gain 25lbs in 25 days", Jim falls short by only gaining 17.5lbs in 25 days. Lets add some bloating, water retention and increased glycogen levels due to the absurd surplus and sugar and you can easily see how its possible. At the end of the experiment Jim gained: 

For overall the knee health, I recently wrote an article on dealing with knee pain. Some main points: 

You don't need to just strengthen your lower back. You are having lower back spasms and difficulties but it's not because your lower back is weak. It's because of systemic issue directly related to your sedentary lifestyle. As such no 'band-aid' solution will help, instead you need a comprehensive overhaul. What you probably suffer from 

Your body is over-reacting. The reaction is in the right direction in that you DO need more calories. But going on a binge because your body feels like it isn't the right answer. You should be eating more since probably 2000-2500 calories isn't sufficient for someone trying to maintain their weight and exercises vigorously. Your maintenance is probably more around 2800-3200 (depending on your height/weight/activity level). So you should be eating more in that range if you want to maintain your weight. Also make sure to actually weigh out and measure your food so you actually hit 2-2500. A lot of people think they are eating a certain amount of calories but either over or underestimate by a significant margin. If you eat around 3k and still have significant hunger problems then you either do need even more calories or the food you are eating isn't very satiating. I definitely would echo eating more fat, although you really won't need more than 30% of your total calories. It's also essential not to over-eat since a big surplus can result in an increase in bodyfat. What's most likely happening with you is a pattern of undereating for several days then having a unintentional 'refeed' day where you eat a big surplus. That holds you over for a couple more days before you get really hungry again. So just increasing your calorie intake overall will get you out of this pattern. 

Where does he look more muscular and 'bigger'? Clearly in the latter picture. Another example is Frank Zane who competed at around 185lbs: 

From my personal experience sleep is essential for focus, productivity, muscular and skeletal system recovery, memory, energy levels, mood and a lot others. There are a lot of different sleep methods from just reducing sleep time to doing sleep intervals (Taking 30 minute naps every 2-3 hours I think). I haven't seen any supporting claims that these methods do work for a significant part of the population. My recommendation is to start with the accepted approach: Sleeping ~8 hours at night time. I personally recommend not sleeping later than 11pm. Evaluate how you respond to that schedule and then start making modifications and see how you react to it. That way you can objectively determine what sleep pattern works the best for you. Make sure to make small adjustments, giving your body enough time to adjust to the new sleep schedule, and record as objective data as possible such as mood/energy levels/focus etc. 

Movement is actually an essential part of maintenance and recovery. Many regenerative processes depend upon impact and activity to repair and build themselves. An example of this is synovial joints. From my knee pain article: 

I've had a very similar pain after doing an intense dumbbell circuit that heavily taxed my forearms. Towards the end of the workout I got a sharp pain while doing barbell front raises -the stress is very similar on your grip/forearm as a kettlebell swing. So most likely this is an overuse injury which causes the tendon to get inflamed. From personal experience the best cure is ice and rest. You can take OTC anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen but I never bothered myself. It takes anywhere from 3-5 days to 2 weeks or so to recover. Another thing that seems to help is massaging/doing soft-tissue work on your forearm muscles. You can just use your hand or a tennis/golf ball and go back and forth on the muscle. To prevent injuries like this in the future: 

Yes it is completely possible. First, let us be clear. You aren't mainly talking about gaining muscle; Instead you are talking about looking better. Probably having a muscular and defined look. It's important to distinguish that because often the biggest obstacle in achieving the look you want is bodyfat, not muscle mass. To illustrate the point: A powerlifter at ~320lbs 

Here's the article where he cites those sources. I can't help but personally agree as rotational movements have always caused me back pain even if they do relieve it in the short run. Other causes of exercise induced back pain: 

According to the wikipedia article sauna followed by cold exposure produced the best results. Overall I think there isn't clear science specifically dealing with the sauna and muscle recovery. At the end of the day, if it makes you feel better you will probably enjoy your training more and get better results in the long run. 

It really shouldn't be a problem eating quite a bit more than 700 calories, even with a suppressed appetite. The key is proper planning and management of your diet so you know what and when to eat and make sure the food availble is there. You mention your appetite is best early in the morning/late at night so it sounds like you take your medication in the morning and its effects last all day. In that case you can have a big breakfast and dinner. Even though it's somewhat better to eat more meals during the day a lot of successful diets -warrior diet, lean gains, IF- are centered around only 1 or 2 big meals. If your medication is split up into separate doses you can time your meals so you eat right before you take your next dose. That way you can have 3 or 4 meals a day which is completely sufficient. If your medication isn't split up you can still do 2 meals and just rely on smaller snacks/meals. For food choices you want to stay with calorie dense and appetizing foods. Fats in general are very calorie dense, so foods like nuts, nut butters, heavy cream, eggs, butter, avocado, cheese, fatty meat/fish etc make it extremely easy to hit your calorie goals. An example breakfast could be eggs + meat (sausage/salmon/steak/bacon)/and or cheese, with a piece of toast/fruit and some veggies. That easily can get up to a thousand calories by itself. Carbs also are a good choice because they can increase your appetite and generally are easy to eat. Things like bagels/flour tortillas pack a lot of calories. Fruit also is high in carbs and make for a great snack -such as oranges/bananas. Its best to stick to whole grains but more processed carbs like sugars/white flour will be easier to eat. Liquid calories can be used as a last resort if you just cannot get the calories up via solid foods. You can make a meal replacement shake by mixing milk, protein powder, fruits, and peanut butter for example. A modest shake can easily pack ~500+ calories and would be very easy to put down. If you have a sensitive stomach/lactose intolerance look into pure whey isolate/lactose free milk. The most important thing is to figure out how many calories you should be eating to achieve your goal -sounds like you want to lose fat, so probably around 1500 calories if you are sedentary. Then figure out how many meals you can realistically eat and split up your caloric intake over those meals. Try to make the meals as balanced and healthy as possible -natural/whole foods, no processed foods, vegetables, balanced macro split. And you will be fine. One last thing to consider is that if you just started on a new medication its possible your appetite will improve soon as you develop tolerance and the side effects are lessened. 

So its clear: in order to achieve a 'muscular' look, bodyfat is actually more important than muscle mass. I say this to shift the discussion from that muscle mass is either as important or more than bodyfat. Because with that assertion a 'bulking' diet is more superior because its the fastest way to gain muscle. Now back to your question.. is it possible to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time? From my experience -and excuse the small bit of self promotion- yes. Is it as fast as if you tried to do one or the other? No. Having said that, different circumstances require different approach: 

Here's a video illustrating benching in the power cage. He has a pretty high arch but that's the only alternative if the lower safety is indeed too low. Another option is to do the pin press. It's not a full range movement or a substitute for regular bench press, but it is a nice supplemental exercise which you can rotate with regular bench. Finally, dumbbell bench press is comparable to barbell and is a lot safer when training by yourself. Also as @MaedeRubenstein mentioned, make sure to keep the bar/dumbbells over your chest. Even when you start failing, just let it come down to your chest. Attempting to throw it back into the hooks might cause you to miss and end up with the bar crushing your neck. If it lands on your chest one technique is just to roll it down to your thighs, and just sit up.
