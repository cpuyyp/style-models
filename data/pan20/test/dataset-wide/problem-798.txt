Since those coordinates are relative to the Earth’s axis, being a practical measurement system for Earth ground observers to use in pointing their telescopes, you need to combine that with Earth's orbit. As a useful visualization, mark that point on a model of the celesial sphere. Compare that with the ecliptic pole: the difference between thise points is what you want to know. I expect you’ll find they are separated by 7.25°, but by marking a model sphere you’ll understand the actual direction. 

Well, Wikipedia says that it's 7.25°to the ecliptic and gives a reference. Looking there clarifies the value in 3 dimensions: 

You need an Orrery. Specifically, one that includes Earth’s rotation. My noting the meridian on the model Earth, you can see how the Earth may be rotated some amount each time the Moon passes on a line between the Earth and Sun. The wikipedia page gives a formula. Take the result (given in UT) and apply the timezone offset for the desired longitude. The same page discusses Lunar calindars and may have the info you are really interested in. 

You ask “someday will these moons collide with each other and be destroyed?” so the answer is yes, at least the inner group. So having 62 (a lot of them) is not the issue; the outer part is stable over billions of years. 

Neither of these seem correct to me. Could someone with real numbers weigh in on this? I seem to recall that seeing artefacts is only possible in the latest high-res images taken from lunar orbit, and the telescope that uses the reflector gets back single photons on some trials and is a much more powerful laser than you could buy! But, a continuous beam may be different? How big of a laser would you need to see a reflection with a viewing instrument that doesn't cost more than the laser? 

I understand that a “large” moon, like ours, keeps the planet’s axis from being peturbed, because the spin axis and the moon’s orbital plane exchange momentum and tend to stay in the same plane, and the orbital angular momentum is much stronger because of the long lever arm. So, tipping the planet means changing the moon’s orbital plane too, and the peturbations don’t make a significant change to its large value. So, why is Pluto, along with the orbital plane of its satellites, tipped nearly 90 degrees? 

In our solar system, the answer to this depends on how you define "annular eclipse" (as opposed to transit). I wrote $URL$ to see how big planets' moons appear compared to the sun. The full results: $URL$ Planet/moon combinations closest to annular eclipse (note these numbers are averages, not ranges): 

Both of these look similar to my answer, so I'm reasonably confident that I'm correct this time. $URL$ if anyone wants to check my work Things to note: 

when the local sideral time is almost a minute ahead of the sun's right ascension. What's going on here? Since the Earth is an ellipsoid, and not a sphere, it turns out that "up", the direction perpendicular to a location on Earth, is NOT directly away from the center of the Earth (it turns out gravity acts in a direction that is neither towards the center of the Earth nor perpendicular to the surface, but that's not relevant for this question): see $URL$ for details. If you want really accurate calculations you'll have to use $URL$ 's $URL$ function. Although this doesn't cause the discrepancy above, another consideration is a location's elevation above the surface of the Earth, which can also have slight effect (since "up" isn't always towards the zenith). Happily, one thing you can ignore is refraction, since refraction at the zenith is effctively zero. My $URL$ is a very approximate representation of where the Sun is overhead and is generated by $URL$ 

What resources are available to find the positions of planets, stars, moons, artifical satellites, asteroids, and other heavenly bodies? 

Yes, you could definitely see Jupiter as a round object if it's angular diameter was 369 arcseconds. The limit for seeing something as round appears to be a diameter of around 1 arcminute. Notes: 

This suggests NASA isn't confident enough of Mercury/Venus (and Earth/Sun) positions to predict that far in the past or future, so my results may be fairly inaccurate. 

I happen to have represented my nation at IOAA Start with "Roy and Clarke's" book : "Astronomy: Principles and Practice" Move on to the references mentioned in the book. 

Here is a link which does the rough math involved. The semi-major axis of this ellipse is equal to the parllax angle P, while the semi-minor axis is equal to P*sin(b), where b is the stars ecliptic latitude. EXTRA NOTE: These parallactic ellipses are often rotated and parameters modified as the abberational ellipse is superposed on it. In practice, things get nigh complicated. 

Hence, distance measurements using parallax method have their range based on the angular resolution of the telescope being used. Image source: $URL$ 

Since the direction of revolution of all the planets is the same, the direction of angular velocity vector on the planet is taken to be North, and the direction of revolution is said to be east. Just like Earth. 

At all places where I have read of Moving Cluster Method for measuring distance to a cluster and once applied myself on data, I have been told that the method has been successfully applied only to Hyades cluster in Taurus. 

The Failures of High Magnification Higher magnification doesn't help you observe deep sky objects better. Deep sky objects unlike stars are extended objects. They subtend a finite solid angle on you. This ensures that the surface brightness(brightness per unit solid angle) of extended objects remains constant. Hence, a higher magnification would not make it brighter for you to see. It is worse for another reason. After a certain magnification, the apparent angular size of the extended object becomes comparable to the field of view, or sometimes even greater. Your eye won't be able to distinguish the object against the background since most of the background is the object itself. Good Uses of Barlow Some of the uses that you can put your Barlow: 

For something to be possible in this universe, doesn't even have to be consistent with the physics we know. Astronomical surprises have often led to revisions in our theories. Thus, all the rare situations you described are possible. How do we detect such evasive systems? There is no definite answer. Based on the data we have about the system, you can get creative while doing data analysis and come up with new methods. That is one of the reasons science continues to be fun. Maybe someone who has had some experience with the concerned matter can expand. Also, such systems are rare due to a physical reason. Mass transfer between binary systems ensures that one of the stars get evolved earlier than the other. The other star either ends up being a low mass star and evolves accordingly in most cases. The remaining cases account for your rare description of systems. See Algol Paradox for an interesting read. 

Indeed, the situation is temporary on a scale of hundreds of millions of years, with reoccuring instabilities. The moons don't run into each other in the short term, but the orbits affect each other and are affected by The sun and other bodies in the solar system. See this presentation by Matija Cuk for details. 

I know that normal planets don't get any larger than Jupiter (or 2 Jupiter radii if hot), as adding more gas just increases density, not radius, until you reach the point of being a brown dwarf star. That compressability, I suppose, is a property of the overall average material that forms star systems, as beyond a critical size it accretes the ambiant gas as well as dust in the cloud. That is, it's mostly hydrogen and a quarter helium with a bit of other stuff. But what about a body made of other stuff, such as rock or metal? Without worrying about planetary formation processes, just that atoms are piled together and feel self gravity. Perhaps it needs to be grown slowly so it has time to cool before adding more. Otherwise, no special techniques: just what would happen if material of suitable composition was heaped together? I suspect that normal ideas of minerals would not exist under that kind of pressure, even if carefully allowed to cool. But can elements other than H and He still compress their volume in the same way, or would a rocky world be able to reach sizes of millions of miles? What about more exotic cases, like the "puffy" planet I heard of that has the density of styrofoam? 

That's an interesting way to put it. Indeed, since bodies spend most of their time at the slow end of an eccentric orbit, the extended lobes will attract each other, torquing the orbits into a birdsnest shape. See this presentation by Dr. Madigan. I'm really disappointed that the more scientifically literate press (like SciAm) doesn't cover this idea, but hypes the large distant bodies idea. (See slide at 15:58 in the video. But, it's the explaination up to that point that describes the mechanism.) In short, the particular clustering of orbit shapes and orientations can be explained through self-interaction of the long-term averages of the bodies' orbits: the apahelion acts as a "virtual object", as you put it, and attract each other. 

This says the sun's declination is 17$^{\circ}$57'18.0" which means the sun is (almost) directly overhead at that latitude. The right ascension is 15h13m30.08s which means the sun is (almost) directly overhead where the local sidereal time is this value. To compute local sidereal time we first use $URL$ to get GMST (I'm using the approximation): 

Since the collision is perfectly elastic, the ball's velocity goes from -80 km/h from the train's reference point (negative being towards the train) to +80 km/h from the train's reference point, a speed increase of 160 km/h. For a stationery observer, therefore, the velocity goes from -30 km/h (towards the train) to 130 km/h, an increase of 160 km/h. The situation you describe only applies if the train isn't moving. I made an error in units below, assuming the train is moving at 50 km per second (not hour) and that the ball is moving at 30 km per second (not hour), am I'm too lazy to correct it. The general principle, however, still applies. The confusion may occur because we're ignoring the train's loss of momentum, which means the train is going slower after the collision, and moving backwards in its own frame of reference. A slightly more detailed calculation: 

where the light blue circle is the Earth, the small blue dot is the geocenter, the black dot in the blue circle is the center of the ellipse, the black ellipse is the orbit of the satellite, and the two black dots on the ellipse are the perigee and final positions of the satellite respectively. Even allowing for the Earth's rotation in the 90 minute timefram, I'm not sure anyone on Earth could see the satellite both at perigee and at its final location. I'm working on a more complete answer at $URL$ 

$m v_b+M v_t=50 M-30 m$ $\frac{m v_b^2}{2}+\frac{M v_t^2}{2}=450 m+1250 M$ There are only two solutions to the equation above, one of which is the initial conditions. The other is: $ \left\{{v_b}\to -\frac{10 (3 m-13 M)}{m+M},{v_t}\to -\frac{10 (11 m-5 M)}{m+M}\right\} $ Plugging in 0.0585 kg for the mass of a tennis ball and 640000 kg for the train, this becomes: $\{{v_b}\to 129.9999854,{v_t}\to 49.99998538\}$ effectively confirming the calculation. I'm not convinced this is a good analogy, however. Gravitational boost occurs when a planet's gravity almost captures a spacecraft, thus nearly making it a satellite, and giving it the same revolution velocity around the Sun as the planet itself. The wikipedia analogy bears only a passing resemblance to this.
