You're going to have a problem with gravity. The center of mass of a sphere is at it's center. As a rule of thumb if you are inside a uniformly dense shell the gravitational attraction of the shell cancels out. There is no way for people to stand and walk on the inside of the surface. Spinning the sphere, hoping to create the illusion of gravity through centripetal force, would lead to non-uniform acceleration. As people traveled away from the equator towards the poles the outward force would decrease. Similarly the direction of the force would be constant while the surface normal (the direction upwards relative to the floor) would be changing. The problems with rotational gravity could be avoided by switching to a cylindrical structure of constant radius. This would also allow for regions to be further away from your light source resulting in colder "polar regions". 

Since vortex rings are sustained by aerodynamic interaction they're not going to work past the speed of sound (340.29 m/s). Best way to protect something from aerodynamic forces is to put it within a fairing of some sort. Such a fairing won't practically contain a plasma. However if you use a copper fairing and fill the inside with lead, it will do an excellent job of damaging whatever it hits. 

No you could not have a macroscopic underground ecosystem powered by lava. At their most extreme hyperthermophiles can survive temperatures of 105C. Lava starts giving off visible light at temperatures ten times that. The closest real world examples to what you are talking about are hydrothermal vents. These only support multi-cellular life up to temperatures of 80C. 

The US considered demonstrating the devastating effect of an atomic bomb before attacking Japan in an attempt to convince the Japanese to surrender without massive civilian casualties. They concluded that they could propose no technical demonstration likely to bring an end to the war. For the same reasons that the US didn't announce the existence of nuclear weapons before bombing Japan, if Japan had the capability to drop an atomic bomb on the US during WWII they would have done so without warning. The most likely outcome is whichever country developed the bomb first would launch a strike at the first opportunity. When the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki they had the capability to conventionally bomb Japanese cities and were doing so regularly. Japan didn't have the capacity to fly bombers over the US. The closest thing they had were high altitude balloons armed with firebombs. This delivery method wouldn't be suitable for delivering a nuclear weapon to US soil. The US was able to launch its attack on Japan from Tinian about 1500 miles from Japan. While the Japanese did have a foothold on American soil in the Aleutian Islands these islands are much closer to Russia than mainland Alaska, let alone the rest of the US. Given the US's superior position late in the war I doubt knowledge of a Japanese atomic bomb would have discouraged the US from bombing Japan. 

Interior hydroponic grow ops with full spectrum lighting will work anywhere regardless of external light conditions. If that isn't your style greenhouses will provide a warm environment for anything with a 75 day or less growing season. They'll probably be enough twilight in your planet's 150 day day that the growing period can be extended beyond just the 75 days of full sunlight. 

* The importance of cultural context in communication is quite well demonstrated in Darmok, the 102nd episode of Star Trek the Next Generation 

Entering and exiting the atmosphere as part of reentry has been done since the 1968 with the Russian Zond 6 lunar probe. This technique, called skip reentry, involves entering the atmosphere at a shallow angle so that the spacecraft is pushed back out of the atmosphere one or more times before reentry. Transitioning from orbital velocities (7.79 km/s) to controlled atmospheric flight (600 m/s) burns off so much energy that you're effectively having to relaunch for each transition back to orbit. This is highly impractical. 

You can't have a tube magazine of a crossbow. The length of the bolts is long enough that it would need to stick out far in front of the bow for it to have any real capacity. This would make it far too cumbersome to be practical. The closest real world designs to what you are considering were the repeating crossbows of China and Korea. They had a stacked magazine on top of the bow that dropped a bolt into place during a lever powered cocking process. 

Be very careful about the puddle of flammable vapors you are standing in. The acid blood special effect in Alien was done in a similar manner. 

Higher gravity is not better for food production. Livestock have evolved to live at 1g. Living in a higher gravity environment would put unneeded stress on their bodies. While individuals will probably gain muscle mass to compensate, the stressed muscles will be tougher from the extra work. Given that one of the most significant effects of microgravity upon organisms is muscle atrophy a lower gravity is not going to improve food production either. 

I don't see any reason why not. While not a true example, an octopus or other cephalopod has bilateral symmetry for their mantel, and arms and tentacles that radiate out around their mouth. They are in fact only bilaterally symmetrical. There are also starfish that have bilateral symmetry as larva and radial symmetry as adults. 

Wound healing isn't controlled by the nervous system. Clotting happens automatically when blood vessels are ruptured. Similarly the inflammatory response is triggered by chemicals released from ruptured cells at the injury site. In very simple terms healing is the regrowth of the injured area. This production of new cells is the same process that cells are produced constantly throughout the body. (Somewhere between 50 and 80 Billion cells are replaced every day). The only difference is that instead of only producing enough cells to replace existing ones, a surplus are needed to create new tissues. As long as a human is otherwise healthy, wound healing isn't affected by the number of wounds. It could be possible to retard the healing of one wound site, probably by restricting the flow of blood to it. This wouldn't have any benefit though since the limiting factor is the rate of tissue formation not resources. 

The miasma doesn't harm animals because the miasma only affects intelligent races. The reason orcs and ogres aren't affected is because they are already tainted by the miasma. Given enough time all intelligent life would turn monstrous if exposed to the miasma. The source for the miasma is obviously magical. Some big spell cast either deliberately or having gone awry. 

Martial arts are just codified combat training. Unless technique, practice and experience confer no advantage upon combatants there will always be a benefit from some form of fighting experience. While your hypothetical animal may be relatively stronger than a human, against one of their own kind such an advantage doesn't exist. This is the situation where possessing a martial tradition will prove most advantageous. 

A sword with a whip attached to the handle is strictly worse than the same sword without. When you are using it as a sword you have the extra weight of the rope dangling from the handle, flopping about, and catching on things. Swords have an edge. This is one of the key features of a sword. If the edge isn't aligned correctly you've effectively hit someone with a weirdly shaped club. As soon as you aren't holding a sword in your hand you have no control over edge alignment. To effectively cut something you have to put some force behind the blow. When someone is holding a sword in their hand they can throw their body weight behind a strike to add more force to it. If you're swinging a sword around on a string you've only got the mass of the sword to provide force of the blow. 

While kangaroos meet a lot of the criteria they are failing on a couple of key points. While kangaroos do congregate in mobs the socials structure is too loose and flexible to a human establish them self as top roo and get the entire mob to follow them. Furthermore this would open the human to regular challenges to his authority from other males. Since these dominance challenges involve face clawing and powerful stomach kicks I don't think humans would be successful at this in the first place. If the animals were going to be kept for meat they would need to be kept in a fenced enclosure. Kangaroos are talented jumpers and the fences that are normally used to fence in other livestock wouldn't be effective. 

If you're looking for something scientific sounding to explain the the silver vulnerability. Start with your explanation of why they're invulnerable to everything else. Something unique to silver disrupts their vulnerability. For instance the "invulnerability protein" reacts violently with silver creating toxic byproducts. 

Since you've ruled out direct manipulation we're left with selective breeding. Selective breeding to the point of sapience will take a very long time. It took roughly 5 million years for the most recent common ancestor between humans and chimps to begin using tools. You're probably looking at a similar time scale for your cephalopods. Chimps reach sexual maturity after 7 years. Cephalopods reach sexual maturity around 1 year, though this will probably increase with time to allow the brain to develop more. From this we can estimate that it will take roughly a million years for selectively bread cephalopods to develop sapience. The selective breeding program would look like a large number of tanks to support a large enough population to reduce the risk of breeding in genetic diseases. Cephalopods can already die of boredom in captivity. There would need to be enough enrichment activities in each tank to keep them entertained especially as their intelligence improves. Next time use CRISPR. 

What you are describing is an armor piercing shell. Specifically you are describing an APHE (Armor Piercing High Explosive) shell. APHE refers to a class of projectiles with an armor piercing penetrator and a shock resistant explosive with a delay fuse. These are designed to pierce the armor before detonating. There is a trade off between kinetic rounds and explosives. The properties that make a good penetrator, hardness, stability and massare not what makes a good explosive. The normal solution is to use different materials for the penetrator and the explosive sections. 

Michigan is already known as the "Great Lakes State" since it borders 4 of the 5 Great Lakes. It will continue to be known for the Great Lakes regardless of any industry that may or may not exist in a particular alternative present. 

If a GMless world is indistinguishable from one ruled by a GM. By definition there is no way to distinguish between the two. This makes the question of the existence of a GM unproveable. It is an interesting theory, but it is equally possible that instead of a tabletop game the world is the dream of a butterfly, a story told by an invisible pink unicorn, was brought into existence by the noodly appendage of the flying spaghetti monster, or that what we observe is all there is. They could certainly have fragments of a rulebook, or claim that things happened by DM fiat instead of some other phenomena. There are similar books and claims in this world. Often these claims are contradicted by other similar claims. Your cult could use any of the existing arguments for the existence of god however like in the real world the skeptical would probably remain skeptical. 

No it's not possible to make a weaponized tuning fork. In perfect laboratory conditions on materials prone to shattering ie. glass it has been possible to shatter materials using their resonant frequency. Getting arbitrary objects to explode just by tapping them in an object the size of a knife is pushing the bounds of impossibility. 

Even if the gum replaced your saliva with a strong acid (that miraculously you aren't affected by) you don't have enough saliva to be able to melt through a wall. The average human produces about half a liter of saliva a day. If you spent your entire day licking the wall that is the maximum amount of acid you would be able to apply to a wall. 

If it did evolve it would probably form as a development of the parietal eye. This is a third light sensing organ that exists in some species of fish, reptiles, and amphibians. This organ is missing from all extant birds and mammals. For such an organ to evolve into a second pair of eyes there would need to be a very strong selective pressure that would encourage it's growth. Since in many some species the lens of the parietal organ becomes opaque as the animal matures there seems to be an active pressure encouraging the lack of use of this organ. Having a second fully developed set of eyes would require a lot of additional infrastructure. Humans would need another visual cortex to process the information they were receiving from this extra set of eyes. There would also need to be a capability to focus on two separate images at once and make sense of these disparate images. A much less developed system could provide a good enough solution to predators approaching from behind. 

What you're talking about is shooting people out of a gun. The problem with this is that guns get their projectiles moving at very high speeds very quickly. Far too quickly for people to handle. To put this is perspective humans can survive brief exposure to 100 g of acceleration during a crash. A 1km long space cannon with a muzzle velocity of 6km/s would provide 1,800 g of acceleration to it's projectile. The spacegun you are describing has 2,000 times that muzzle velocity. You will run into similar problems on the end of the journey. When the 3,000 ton slug collides with it's target both it and the target are going to be destroyed. Unless there is a system to slowly decelerate the projectile any occupants are going to be dead on arrival. 

Capsaicin or other pepper spray. Capsaicin works by triggering the sensory neurons associated with sensing heat and physical abrasion. The inflammation associated with exposure is a result of our physiological response to the sensation, not a chemical response to the Capsaicin. Your hero will cause a lot of pain to their adversaries without injuring themselves. One of the disadvantages of aerosolized compounds is that there is always the risk of self exposure due to the direction of the wind. Since your hero won't feel the effects while transferring sensations of pain this will improve their efficacy. 

Natural latex rubber. It's a bit hard to source in 13th century Holland. If your magical enclave has access to non-native plants then rubber trees are within the realm of possibility. 

Mechs are strictly worse than tanks of comparable size. There is no environment where a mecha is going to be superior to a tank. The upright posture makes them easier to detect and target than a tank. A smaller contact area with the ground means that they will get bogged down in soft or unstable terrain easier. Their upright posture makes them a less stable firing platform. The higher center of gravity makes them more likely to be knocked on their side due to driver error or impact. A tracked vehicle is more energy efficient and less mechanically complex than a mecha. We live in a world where man portable anti tank missiles exist. If there existed an environment where a mecha could travel it would be an easy target to any well equipped infantry group. 

Ignoring the ethics of it, raising enhanced children as soldiers isn't practical. First off you'd need a 18 year lead time for available soldiers. Good luck knowing what your military needs are almost two decades in the future. It's also a massive up front investment. Raising normal children is expensive. Enhancements and training won't be cheap either. What you get for all this time and money is someone a little stronger and slightly faster who will die just as fast as everybody else. 

Pretty poorly. I'm going to assume that by hunter gatherer society they don't do much metalworking. This means that their spear is going to be made of mostly wood, bone, sinew, and rock. A flaming spear made of such materials is going to be structurally weakened and unbalanced by the attachment of a wick. Sure it would look scary at first, but attacking like this loses the element of surprise. There aren't any lighters or matches available so a small fire would need to be built to light the torches. This could be done out of sight of the enemy meaning that they would be detected as they approach, or a fire could be built immediately before the attack which would attract curious people wondering "Why does our enemy stop to build a fire before attacking us?". 

Not much. Even with the added complexity of a non-binary computer electronic computers are vastly superior to mechanical computers or doing it out longhand. What we would use computers for wouldn't change since computability isn't dependent on the system used to represent numbers in hardware. We'd still see a similar iterative cycle of improvement in computing hardware eventually running up against the same physical limits we are now. 

It would not be effective. If you had a fire shield hot enough to instantly melt a sword as it was swung at you. It would be hot enough to destroy the ground you walked upon. You would be standing in a pool of molten sand. You would not be able to do this near anyone not protected from the extreme heat, or near any structure or building. Even if you do melt an object it will still have the same amount of kinetic energy and will still hit you with the same force. A bullet of molten lead will actually transfer more of that energy to you. Increasing the lethality.
