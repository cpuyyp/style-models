If $\gamma$ is smooth with $D\gamma$ of rank $1$ everywhere, then $\gamma(\mathbb{S}^1)$ is a submanifold ($\gamma$ is injective by definition and $\mathbb{S}^1$ is compact). In particular, it is a connected manifold, and we have a well-defined topological degree $\deg(\gamma)$ since it does not depend on a choice of a regular value of $\gamma$ on the image. This is one straight-forward generalization of the case $n=2$ for curves in higher dimensions. There are probably other approaches as well. Outerelo and Ruiz introduce $w(f,a)$ for continuous $f$ defined only on hypersurfaces $X:=\partial\bar{U}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ (for some $U$ open and bounded). In particular, the construction does not seem to work for curves for $n\geq 3$. More generally, the topological degree appears to be defined only for maps whose domain and codomain are of equal dimension. (In this interpretation and modulo technical details, the winding number in the plane is the degree of a map defined on the unit disk which restricts on the boundary to our curve.) 

No. Let $G$ be a locally compact group acting on a compact Hausdorff topological space $X$. Then the canonical $*$-homomorphism $C^*(G)\rightarrow C(X)\rtimes G$ is injective iff there is an invariant measure on $X$. The later can be equivalent to amenability of $G$ for some $X=\beta^{lu}(G)$. When $G$ is discrete, then $\beta^{lu}(G)$ is the Stone-Cech compactification of $G$. 

By the way, it is known for $SU_q(2)$ and $SU_q(2)\cong A_o(Q)$ for $Q=\begin{pmatrix} 0& |q|^{1/2} \newline -\text{sign}(q)|q|^{-1/2}&0 \end{pmatrix}.$ I just find out that the Haar state is tracial if and only if the coinverse $\kappa$ on the dense Hopf $*$-algebra satifies $\kappa^2=id$ (see "compact quantum groups" Thm 1.5 by Woronowicz). Thanks! 

Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group. Q: If $l^\infty(\Gamma)\rtimes \Gamma=l^\infty(\Gamma)\rtimes_r \Gamma$ canonically, can we conclude that $\Gamma$ is an exact group? The converse implication is well-known and if we replace $l^\infty(\Gamma)$ by $l^\infty(\Gamma)/C_0(\Gamma)$ we have indeed an affirmative answer to the question. The latter fact can be found in Section 5 of "Ghostbusting and property A" by Roe and Willett or Theorem 5.6 in $URL$ 

A vastly improved support for handwritten math (e.g. via digitizer pen) incl. its conversion to typeset math would be awesome! In a long run, ideally it should be able to replace LaTeX. Just think of how much of researchers' time is spent on inputting math. 

Formally, the answer is "yes, of course, by simply translating all the winding number stuff in Artin's proof back to homology", but I hope it's clear by now it's not what I have in mind as reasonable. The motivation is to be able to present a general Cauchy Integral Theorem as early as Cauchy-Goursat, in particular before introducing $dz/(z-a)$. 

Depending on one's approach to Complex Analysis in One Variable, Cauchy's Integral Theorem is one of the first interesting results about holomorphic functions in any course. There are several related versions of it: 

Actually, matrix-valued differential forms are used a lot in hypercomplex analysis/hypercomplex geometry, which, as the name suggests, includes certain complex manifolds. There is a nice account of such differential forms in Rocha-Chavez, Shapiro, and Sommen "Integral Theorems for Functions and Differential Forms in $\mathbb{C}^m$" (2001) (~200 pages). The first chapter is a general introduction to (complex-valued) differential forms, the second chapter discusses differential forms with values in the 2x2-matrices, and then the book goes on into the realm of hyperholomorphy, including hyperholomorphic Hodge theory. 

Let $G$ be a non-amenable countable discrete group. How can I show that the group von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ has no injective direct summand? 

Let $k$ be a field with characteristic zero and $G$ be a (connected or not) linear algebraic group defined over $k$. We know that $G$ has a Levi decomposition i.e., $G=R_u(G)\rtimes L$, where $R_u(G)$ is the unipotent radical of $G$ and $L$ is a Levi factor of $G$ which is a reductive complement to the unipotent radical. Q: What does this mean? $G(k)=R_u(G)(k)\rtimes L(k)$ or $G(\bar{k})=R_u(G)(\bar{k})\rtimes L(\bar{k})$? where $\bar{k}$ is the algebraic closure of $k$. I guess it follows from the fact that the first Galois cohomology of a unipotent group over fields with characteristic zero is trivial. Because I have learned the following: Suppose $1\rightarrow A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow1$ is a sequence of morhisms of algebraic groups and that the induced sequence $1\rightarrow A(l)\rightarrow B(l)\rightarrow C(l)\rightarrow 1$ is exact for some Galois extension $l/k$ finite or infinite. Then we get an exact sequence $1\rightarrow A(k)\rightarrow B(k)\rightarrow C(k)\rightarrow H^1(l/k,A)\rightarrow H^1(l/k,B) \rightarrow H^1(l/k,C)$. 

I would say, it depends on how much Differential Topology you are interested in. Generally speaking, Differential Topology makes use of Algebraic Topology at various places, but there are also books like Hirsch' that introduce Differential Topology without (almost) any references to Algebraic Topology. Having said that, topological theory built on differential forms needs background/experience in Algebraic Topology (and some Homological Algebra). In other words, for a proper study of Differential Topology, Algebraic Topology is a prerequisite. Addendum (book recommendations): 1) For a general introduction to Geometry and Topology: 

Let $L/K$ be a finite separable field extension and let $\theta$ be a primitive element for $L/K$ with minimal polynomial $\mu(t) \equiv \mu_{\theta/K}(t) = \sum_{k=0}^n c_k t^k$. I am trying to compute the powers $\theta^n,\dots,\theta^{2n-2}$ in terms of $1,\theta,\dots,\theta^{n-1}$. In other words, I am trying to compute the structure constants of the basis $1,\theta,\dots,\theta^{n-1}$ in terms of the coefficients of $\mu(t)$, but the expressions quickly become unmanageable. I can hardly imagine that I am the first one to attempt such a calculation, so my question is 

Q1: Answer can be founded in $URL$ Q2: I think it is still open. Q3: Answer is Yes. It is proved by Tu see LEMME 3.5 in "La conjecture de Baum-Connes pour les feuilletages moyennables. K-Theory 17 (1999), no. 3, 215--264" 

Let $K$ be a local field of characteristic $p$, where $p$ is a prime number greater than 2. In particular, $(x+y)^p=x^p+y^p$ for $x,y\in K$. The fake Heisenberg group is defined to be $$ G=\{\begin{pmatrix} 1&a&b\\ 0&1&a^p\\ 0&0&1\\ \end{pmatrix}: a,b\in K\}$$ It is a non-abelian, $K$-split connected algebraic group, which is also unipotent with nilpotent length two. Consider its Lie ring $$ \mathfrak{g}=\text{Log}(G)=\{\begin{pmatrix} 0&x&y\\ 0&0&x^p\\ 0&0&0\\ \end{pmatrix}: x,y\in K\}$$ Since $K$ is not perfect, $\mathfrak{g}$ is not stable under scalar multiplication. In particular, $\mathfrak{g}$ is not a vector Space and is different from Lie(G), the Lie algebra associated to G. Q.1: Do we know the unitary dual $\hat{G}$ of $G$? Notice that $G$ is a central non-split extension of the additive group $K$: $$0\rightarrow K\rightarrow G \rightarrow K \rightarrow 0.$$ I can image to apply the Machey Machine to this group extension similar to the real Heisenberg groups. Q.2: Is $G$ CCR? or type I? Q.3: Let $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ be the Pontrjagin dual of the additive group $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $G$ act on $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ by the coadjoint action. Are all orbits closed or locally closed in $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$? Recall that the adjoint action of $G$ on $\mathfrak{g}$ is defined by $Ad(g)(X)=gXg^{-1}$ for $g\in G$ and $X\in \mathfrak{g}$ and the coadjoint action of $G$ on $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ is defined by $Ad^*(g)(f)=f\circ Ad(g^{-1})$ for $f\in \hat{\mathfrak{g}}$. Dear all, my motivation is about the Kirillov orbit method for unipotent Groups over a local field of positive characteristic (see Corollary 7.3 and Exapmple 8.3 in A general Kirillov Theory for locally compact nilpotent groups). It describes the unitary dual of $G$ by its coadjoint orbits. In order to do this, we need to know Q.3 has an affirmative answer according to Corollary 7.3 and Exapmple 8.3 in op. cit. So if the associated Lie ring $\mathfrak{g}$ is a vector space (this is always the case if char(K)=0), then we can identify its Pontrygagin dual with its linear dual, on which the unipotent group $G$ acts algebraiclly by the coadjoint action. Since unipotent Groups act algebraiclly on an affine variety, all its orbits are closed. Then the orbit method (Corollary 7.3 in op. cit.) implies that the group $G$ is CCR and the Kirillov-orbit map is a homeomorphism. Hence, we have affirmative answers for all my questions. For unipotent Groups over a local field $K$ with char(K)=p. I find the above obstruction. However, if we start with a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ (in particular, a vector space) with nilpotent length less that $p$ and consider the group $G=\exp(\mathfrak{g})$ obtained by exponentiating it, then we have affirmative answers for all my questions by exactly same argyments. Remark that $\exp: \mathfrak{g}\rightarrow G, \exp(X)=\sum_{l=0}^{3}\frac{X^l}{l!}$ with the inverse $\text{Log}: G\rightarrow \mathfrak{g}: \text{Log}(g)=\sum_{l=1}^{3} \frac{(-1)^l}{l+1}(1-g)^l$. 

Notice that using the dual basis with respect to the trace essentially seems to run into the same issues. I have looked into J.S.Milne's notes on Fields and Galois Theory and on Algebraic Number Theory as well as in Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory, but in this regard they don't seem to go beyond calculating the discriminant. 

I don't know about generally accepted, but $\log^{(n)}X$ seems pretty concise. It conforms to the usual notation for functional iterations and there is no room for confusion with either taking powers or using different bases, e.g. $(\log_2^{(n)}X)^k$.

I have a few questions about amenability at infinity for locally compact, second countable, Hausdorff topological groups. Recall that a locally compact group $G$ is said to be amenable at infinity if there exists a topologically amenable action (in the sense of $URL$ of $G$ on some compact Hausdorff space $X$. Permanence property: Q 1. What kinds of permanence properties do we know about amenability at infinity for locally compact, second countable non-discrete groups? e.g. If $\Gamma$ is a Lattice in $G$, which is amenable at infinity, does it imply that $G$ itself is amenable at infinity? Examples: Q 2. Which locally compact non-discrete groups are known to be amenable at infinity? e.g. Are Haagerup groups amenable at infinity? Q 3. Let $G$ be a locally compact, second countable Hausdorff topological group, which acts amenably on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Does the transformation groupoid $X\rtimes G$ admit a continuous proper negative type function $\psi$? negative type means 1) $\psi(x,e)=0$ for all $x\in X$; 2) $\psi(x,g)=\psi(g^{-1}x,g^{-1})$ for all $(x,g)\in X\times G$; 3) $\sum_{i,j=1}^nt_it_j \psi(g_i^{-1}x,g_i^{-1}g_j)\leq 0$ for all $t_1,\ldots,t_n$ in $\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $\sum_{i=1}^n t_i=0$, $g_i\in G$ and $x\in X$. 

Addendum: As can be seen from Timothy Chow's answer, the statement in Stewert and Tall's book that "Miyaoka had used a technique parallel to that of Wiles, by translating the number-theoretic problem into a different mathematical theory — in this case, differential geometry" is actually a bit misleading in that regard. For, in fact, he did the opposite - he tried to transfer notions from differential geometry (and related alg. topology) to the arithmetic world rather than give a differential-geometric (in a strict sense) proof. Sorry to get the hopes of our differential geometers too high! 

In particular, it seems that implicitly $A_i$ are meant to be $\mathbb{R}$-subalgebras (without unit) and $A_{i+1}$ an ideal of $A_i$. On the other hand, not all $A_i$ are necessarily ideals of $A$ since in general the length of $A$ as an $A$-module need not equal $\dim_{\mathbb{R}}A$. Or perhaps $A_i$ are only vector spaces such that the quotient vector space $A_i/A_{i+1}$ still "magically" inherits multiplication from $A$? Or am I missing something entirely obvious? Thanks!
