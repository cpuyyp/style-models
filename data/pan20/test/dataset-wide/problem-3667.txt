For weight loss, all that matters is the calorie deficit. You can lose weight just by reducing caloric intake and without exercising. *Of course, exercising can help you lose weight faster because a pound of muscle burns more calories than a pound of fat (a help of maybe about -6 calories/day for us non-Olympic athletes - it's still help!). When to exercise is a personal thing. Some people like to avoid a crowded gym so they go on "off-hours". Some people like having someone to talk to, so they go during "peak" hours. Some people don't want to shower at the gym so they'll work out after work and shower when they get home. Don't feel like you have to lock into a routine (always morning, noon, or night), life happens. You might get discouraged if an emergency lunch meeting derails your gym plans and you feel like you've "failed". Make your dedication routine and you'll fit it in your day. 

Posture Exercises - YouTube - need foam roller Mayo Clinic - Slideshow of Core Exercises - bridge a.k.a. pelvic tilts (works pelvic floor), planks (works abs and lower back) and superman's (lower back, stretches abs) are great, no additional equipment needed Deadlift - you want to maintain muscle balance by exercising the opposing muscle (the lower back and abs are opposing muscles), need access to bar/plates or dumbbells 

Are your fingers short in length? That might be compounding your problem. My fingers are short - I can't palm a basketball. Some lateral pull down bars have the foam padding which makes it a greater circumference. I usually use the bar that is pad-less (because of my fingers being short). Also, you don't have to use the "conventional" methods to target your back. You can try a kettle ball deadlift. You can try using the different bar attachments for the lat pull down machine like the V-bar and see if you like the "feel" of that better. That site also shows the "close grip" other grips such as reverse grip, neutral grip, overhand close grip, etc.. 

You can throw in protein powder if you want or greens. If you are strength training, I think you need to try to meet your protein intake. Do some experimenting or try a home shake. In the meantime, get the rest of your servings from protein you do like: eggs, chicken, lean beef, and what have you. 

You can do standing calf raises by going on your tip-toes and then flat. You can do them on the floor or for a greater extension use stairs to get a deeper flex going down (i.e. heel lower than toes). You can carry dumbbells but for stability and safety reasons, I would suggest doing those on flat ground and not on a step. $URL$ 

Not every stomach is built for protein powder (if that's what you're using) so I think your body is saying that it has to get used to it and/or it just doesn't like the taste. You might just need to find the brand and/or flavor you do like. I personally like Metabolic Drive protein powder - that doesn't seem to be so rough on my digestion. Muscle Milk tends to have a lot of sugar in it. Recently though, I just make homemade shakes. Here's my recipe that I throw in a magic bullet: 

You guys should do relay races together! In the states, my husband and I do the Muddy Buddy. He is 10" taller than me so sharing a bike has been daunting. He looks like those clowns that ride tiny bikes (less the make-up). I see you are in Australia, here's a site for some Adventure Races. You guys can work on improving times together. Adventure races are so much fun with a partner and it's always a great community. 

Since you are only running 10-15 miles/week and your race is in 7 weeks with a goal of sub 45 min, it's going to be tough (unless you are an incredible athlete). Had you been following the training runs from Cool Running's 10K schedule, you would have ran 28+ miles this week. To work on your speed you need to do speed drills and you need to up your running. It's not really a realistic goal... HOWEVER... Cool Running's training schedule is somewhat conservative. That schedule is for a 40 min - 48 min finish time and you said you can already do it in 48:45 min. You can try out the training run for the week you should be on and see how you feel. If you feel good, keep going with the schedule! 

I heart deadlifts and good morning's. Deadlifts are a pretty natural body movement we do probably more than we think about it (sans weights to start usually of course) - lifting kids off the floor, picking up something you dropped, opening lower cabinet doors, putting/removing items from the trunk of your car... The exercise is just a way of strengthening those every day muscles with proper form. 

I personally think GU isn't very appetizing and would opt for packets of honey instead. Although honey won't have sodium and potassium like you find in gel packs. I found an interesting study and an article that suggests training your body to tap into your fat stores. 

Create a food diary and count your calories Create a work-out diary and count your work-outs. This will help you track your improvements. 

Generally you need to have a 500 calorie deficit every day to lose approximately a pound a week. Losing weight is all about calories in vs. calories out. Quality of your meals is also paramount. Garbage in = garbage out after all. So long as what is or isn't in your stomach does not affect your ability to sleep, that's all that matters so that your body can repair your muscles. Personally, I can't go to sleep hungry. You need quality sleep and avoid overeating for weight loss. Waking up ravenous may make some people overeat during their first meal. If you need to eat smaller, more frequent meals while incorporating healthy snacks to avoid being so hungry for the next meal, then that might be what you need to avoid over indulging. If you are used to eating 3 "full" meals, then that is fine too. Keep your overall calories in control and you'll burn fat. 

Enlist a gym/work-out buddy! Knowing someone is counting on you and holding YOU accountable for showing up will help motivate you to get moving. You can always walk to a mid-point and grab lunch together. But you must recognize if your "buddy" is making excuses and making it easier for you to quit too. Then you have to cut them loose!!! If you can't enlist a buddy, try to just get outside: walk to the park or grocery store. Can you run some errands by walking instead of driving? Window shop? Since you are just starting to run, alternate running and walking. Use landmarks like, "I'm going to jog to that tree". Write down your accomplishments! This is very important in self-motivation especially if you see yourself starting to slack off. By keeping a log, you can see how far you've come and also keeps tabs on yourself for taking too many days off. Don't feel like you need to be running for a certain distance or time to feel accomplished. That's why a personal log is good because it's relative to YOU and your only competition is yourself. Check out local running shops. They usually have meet-up's on certain days and have all sorts of levels. Check out running websites for training programs and forums. You are not alone! 

Congrats on your weight loss and quitting smoking! I do think your smoking history has something to do with your lungs burning. Your body isn't used to your new lifestyle (you pretty much shocked it by quitting smoking and losing 50 lbs I assume was the same time as quitting?) and it's adjusting. I would suggest letting your lungs heal and letting your body clean itself out. Running is an advanced activity. Keep at a pace before you feel the burn so that you are out there longer. I would suggest incorporating a weight training regimen into your exercises. It will get you into running shape. That program does high intensity interval training so you can run-walk. Eventually the burn will go away as your lungs heal. Exercise isn't going to heal your lungs, time and nutrition will. 

Protein intake is used to help with muscle growth. Muscles weigh more so yes, in that way it could be said that it might make you gain some weight. But if your workouts are that intense, I would not worry about that and read the label on back of the protein powder too - some have added sugar. This article has a good guideline for how to start figuring out what your intake should be. If you have a dairy sensitivity you might want a protein powder without whey. Some people I know have gotten over dairy sensitivity by also taking probiotics. Make sure you have enough fiber and water in your diet so the protein shake doesn't make you constipated. I would try a brand out and see if your body likes it. Regarding lots of cardio and losing muscle: I don't think that will happen to you because you are a sprinter not a marathoner. Your work-outs are totally different. As a result, marathoners have smaller looking muscles but with greater endurance than sprinters. 

If a training program tells you to run say 5 miles one day, what are the consequences of splitting up that run? Is there some gray area where you can reap the same/most benefits (say splitting run to 4 and 1 VS. 5 one-milers)? Studies to show the difference would be great. If you are marathon training and your run that day is 20 miles, the point is to get used to running that mileage so I would say splitting the run is detrimental to the training. I think there may be some leeway in the lower mileage zones though? 

Are you in any pain? If you are in pain, you might want to consult a physical therapist/sports doctor before trying to exercise your heels. If you aren't in pain, you can go up and down on your tippy-toes to work your heels using body-weight or you can do standing calf raises if you have access to a gym. The machine will allow for a deeper stretch and standing on steps (from a staircase/stairwell) will work the same if you want to start off with body-weight (recommended). And stretching your heels using regular stretches as well as manually (i.e. bending the foot one way and back and holding) would be sufficient to stretch it. 

I would definitely go to a sports doctor esp. since it's better to catch this while you're young and regenerate faster than when you're older. I had this piercing pain on my left knee when it wasn't moving. It usually happened while I was driving; I guess the certain angle I had it at in the car aggravated it. I went to a sports doc who did an X-ray and I was diagnosed with chondromalacia (which has the same symptoms as jumper's knee, runner's knee, tennis knee, hiker's knee --- basically overuse of a repetitive motion). I played volleyball and had terrible form then. I would jump on the one knee to spike rather than both legs. "Chondromalacia is caused by the disproportionate development of muscles around the knee. The muscles then pull the knee cap in an abnormal direction (ref: above link)" So you want to focus on strengthening the muscle that is weaker which is why I suggest going to a doctor to find out the real underlying issue and if it's chondromalacia, to see which muscle is weaker (you can tell because your knee cap will be angled and you need to "get" it straight). Good luck! 

You might want to start them off with incline push-ups (like on a bench) which are easier than horizontal push-ups. It doesn't totally eliminate the butt rising but maybe because it's an easier work-out, it will allow them to focus on the proper arm motion. This change also serves as a leveling field for those who do not yet have the strength. 

You're supposed to drink 8-10 glasses of water a day. 8-10 glasses of juice is a lot of excess calories and sugar. You might find yourself gaining weight at a rapid pace which maybe you want. It's like drinking soda. 355 mL can of Coca Cola = 39g of sugar 200 mL juice box of Trader Joe's White Grape Juice = 30g of sugar Just some thoughts to consider if you do switch. 

For someone who is new at the sport, strength training not only helps prevent injuries but will increase muscle mass thereby making running easier which means your endurance and speed improves. However, for the elite-athlete (i.e. marathoners) the endurance gains are far less from strength training but more from just honing their craft - they just run a lot. All their muscles are used to it. 

Depends. You could still be progressing in your weight lifting routine (still able to add more weights) after 8 weeks depending on where you started. By 12 weeks, I would say that generally many people would be close to if not at the point of plateau after doing the same stuff that whole time. My program changed every month (with 2 work-out routines that alternated) by increasing in duration, added work-outs, and increased difficulty variation of a previous exercise. There were some repeat exercises in there though. For me, it was nice changing every month because the exercises always felt "new" which helped my mental stamina a lot. Bench press isn't the only way to target your chest muscles but if you like that exercise then keep it! The change doesn't need to be drastic. You can change up your routine in many ways: 

I couldn't find anything for splitting "short" runs. From the lack of discussion on the Internet, I infer that the running world is probably just telling me to suck it up, stop thinking about it, and just run. Safe to assume then that splitting short runs is fine, split any which way, and I can give myself full credit for "getting the miles in". It seems that training runs for a 5K thru a half-marathon distance do not qualify as candidates for a "split run" according to this article which had a great table.
