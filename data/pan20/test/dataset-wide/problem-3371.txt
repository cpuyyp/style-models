What non-Germanic languages were spoken ca. 500 BC to 500 AD in areas that speak Germanic languages today? How do we know? What traces do languages leave if they leave no descendants? 

In American Sign Language (ASL) a certain kind of anaphora is found by assigning things in the discourse to physical locations around the speaker. For example, if you say "my brother's new house" and gesture to a point off to your right, you've now assigned that referent to that location. Then you can gesture to that location again to use it like a pronoun, referring to your brother's new house without naming it again. Then you might say "the piano that fell on my car" and gesture to your left, and now you can gesture to that location to talk about the piano. What are the proper terms for referring to this sort of concept? 

What do you call a suffix that gives an "anti-pejorative" meaning to a word? For example, imagine if you could do this: 

the process of assigning a thing to a location (assignment? reference? indexing?) the thing that is assigned (referent?) the location that refers to the thing (pronoun? anaphor?) 

Question 2 is more general. A language that dies out can leave traces on the languages around it -- the same traces that a living language can leave. Words can be borrowed; phrases can be borrowed or directly translated. Look at the concept of a Sprachbund for some interesting types of borrowing between languages. 

Usually when we sign* we use our mouths to mouthe a word. This can be used to disambiguate certain lexemes (for example, divorce and ex-spouse have the same sign in ASL, so one way to clarify which you mean is to mouthe whichever of those two English words.). So it's quite natural to also whisper it because you can't help but let some air pass through your mouth. It's almost instinctive. But if you were watching a video, you could mute it, or if you're completely deaf or it's too loud you might miss it, which means that that sound is not necessary to the understanding, but rather an anatomically conditioned side effect. A parallel with spoken languages: when you speak, your head will move around. You (almost) can't help it. But if that movement were unobservable, for example on the phone, it doesn't affect your communication at all. You say you thought deaf people cannot hear anything. It's not usually true. Most deaf people, even profoundly deaf people, have at least some hearing. And sometimes, sounds accompany signed conversation. (It's rather a separate matter from what you're asking about, but it's related. And in case anyone comes here from a google search...) These sounds which are lexically part of a sign language are usually a single syllable like (which means something like "at last!") or (which means "large" or "overwhelming", or which I can't remember what it means. (these can also be distinguished non-audially, by lip-reading). These three examples come from ASL. I can't quite put my finger on the syntactic role of these, but it's kind of adverbial or possibly modal. *: It's fine to say converse too. even "speaking" sign language is okay terminology! It doesn't bother us. And of course, "translate" is the right word for when we take for example a sentence in ASL and render it for example in English. 

Is there a single, unified place where one can look up cuneiform signs for Sumerian words? Unicode now supports cuneiform, but every source I've found has only transliterations, not actual cuneiform. For example, I'd like to find this: 

Question 1 leads to a long list of languages. Proto-Germanic is conjectured to have existed somewhere between 500 BC and 500 AD, roughly the period of Roman ascendancy over Europe. We look at where Germanic languages are spoken today, then look back to the Roman period, and we can see that: 

So if I'm talking to you about something that's here in the same room as us, I'd say it's . It's here where both of us are. If I'm inviting you to come across the room to sit over here by me, I'd invite you to come . This emphasizes that it's over here by me, not "here" where we both are. If I'm talking about something over near you, I'd say it's . If I'm pointing at something far off, something far from both of us, I'd say it's . 

How exactly this change came about is actually rather interesting from a historical point of view. The suffix marking verbal nouns (like in "a building") was "-inge" in Middle English, while the suffix marking progressive participles (like in "I'm running") was "-inde". The two merged together in southern England in the 1300s, spreading slowly but never quite taking over the whole English-speaking world. 

The grammar is there, even if it's confused by something else. As you probably know, in Swedish every noun is either "ett" or "en". It's unpredictable sometimes, but this feature is inherent in the noun. Why is "lag" sometimes "en" and sometimes "ett"? It's because actually there are two/three separate words here. 

It is exactly as you say. "uitsluitend" is the present participle of uitsluiten, which means to exclude. Also it's an adjective meaning "exclusive". I am sure you could find exactly this information in any dictionary. I couldn't quite work out why you believe these meanings are opposite though. Obviously if you exclude something/someone, you are being exclusive. The meaning is identical. 

Germanic languages tend to have a rule that if the nucleus is long, then a coda is short, and if a coda is long (say, a consonant cluster, or, in the case of some other languages, a geminate consonant) then the nucleus is short. Grewendorf posits another slot at the end of the German syllable, the suffix. It's mostly occupied by flectional morphemes, but in the case of Mond it seems to be occupied by the last segment of the lexical morpheme. You could have a look at Sprachliches Wissen by Grewendorf if you want to know more about this. 

There are plenty to choose from! Just take a look at this map. Here are a few examples from that page: 

Spanish (at least in Mexico) distinguishes two different deixis factors. I'll show it phonemically instead of orthographically: 

Sometimes the written and spoken forms of a language evolve separately. A change in written English might not affect the way words sound, and a change in spoken English might not affect the way words are spelled. Language always changes over time, whether spoken or written. I'm glossing over some details in the examples above, but I hope you get the gist of it. 

This is a very common phenomenon, where a sound in a language can be spelled in multiple ways, or a certain spelling can have multiple pronunciations. To give a quick answer to your question: Written and spoken forms of a language can change independently. Let's start by looking at the two cases you mention: |x| and |c|, and we'll also look at silent |k|. We'll follow the convention of putting spellings between |vertical pipes| and putting pronunciations between /slashes/. |x| might as well be |ks| Why do we have |x| at all? Historical accident -- the letter |x| was used to spell /ks/ in Western Greek, then was borrowed by the Etruscans, then by the Romans, then by the Saxons. Usually when people borrow a writing system, they borrow the whole thing, even if it's not a perfect fit for their own language. |c| says either /k/ or /s/ Two questions come up here: Why does |c| have two sounds? Why do we have |c| in the first place?
