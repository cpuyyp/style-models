Humans did have "weapons" (and in a way still do) - the gorillas (for instance) can defend themselves quite well. With time those "weapons" became less relevant (even counter-effective at times) and gradually declined. Of course, those "weapons" are limited when compared to a carnivore (such as a lion), but that's just nature, carnivores will always be better equipped. In fact, it is believed that the fact we are not carnivores (but omnivores) was highly important to our evolution. While herbivores spend much of their day eating food, and carnivores hunt fast and then are inactive for the rest of the day (one meat meal is enough), omnivores combine the best of two worlds. They do look for food (a challenge) but also have "free" time, and are otherwise far more versatile and flexible. Some evolutionists believe (see the link above) that those factors were crucial for humanity to develop intelligence. 

On one hand, you can't burn them all, on the other hand, collaboration is a risky path - eventually, someone will betray you. You need a third way: Become God. Find a relatively large and strong tribe, preferably one that you did not burn recently. Strat helping them from time to time, convince them that you are the one and only god, creator of the world and humankind. It shouldn't be particularly complicated - you are obviously different, stronger and smarter then they are. With your help, this tribe will conquer many others, and their religion (i.e. you as a god) will spread even further. They will even give you food and other gifts. Eventually, they won't need your assistance, but your godly nature will likely remain unchallenged for centuries - you are a living proof that God exists. Moreover, the believers are quite unlikely to betray you, and will even defend you at any cost. Hopefully, if a time comes and unbelievers form a majority, the ethics will change and you will become a national symbol\heritage, or at least an equal member of society. 

We would observe differences. At the moment is an axiom of modern physics that the laws are the same everywhere. When we observe differences between the physics outside the solar system and locally, we come up with other models which might work over both scales, but there is no local evidence for these models. For example, the rotation of galaxies is different to what the laws of physics as empirically measured on Earth would be. One way of compensating for that is to introduce dark matter, another is to add another term to the inverse square law that is too small to notice on local scales. As either model does not have any effect on local scales, there is no way to prove them empirically. 

These in part grew out of a desired that, for the preservation of individual liberty, a militarised police force controlled by the government was undesirable. Alternatives, such as allowing an arms race between the a militarised police force and an arms bearing population to maintain balance, have been shown to fail to produce a safe environment for the general populace. 

There isn't really an "average" animal, but I suspect the median animal with limbs is krill, which has a dozen or so limbs and a tiny nervous system. One of the largest animals in the world is the giant squid, which has ten limbs which can move in much more complex ways than jointed skeletal limbs, so putting a limit on size of multi-limbed creatures has obvious counterexamples. Squid brains are rather small compared with the size of them. Instead, cephalopod limbs are controlled by a more distributed network of ganglia. If there is an advantage for a large animal to have many limbs, then evolution will find a way to achieve it. 

Somewhat like early-modern fortifications, with some adjustments. In our world, by the time avaiation appeared, melee combat was long gone. But your world has both, and that creates a problem: The best defense vs melee is a high wall, but the best defense against an attack from the air is a bunker. The two are quite the opposite, and it is hard to build a fortification that combines both. The closest thing from out world will be early-modern fortifications, that had to defend from both cannons and partly-melee armies. So, assuming that in your world aviation and artillery are at least somewhat effective, Iâ€™d imagine the perfect fort looking like this: 

All in all, democracies work better because the people's self-interest is aligned with the states one. Your win is typically the state's win, while in an autocracy it's quite common to work against the state. This makes everything work much better. In our world, in the end, democracies were always more technologically, industrially and economically advanced. The best example is, of course, the Cold War, but you can also look at South Korea vs North Korea, or East Germany vs West Germany etc. The difference is that [unlike in a computer game] a state is, essentially, a bunch of people. Given the same resources and starting position, any country will only be as successful as it's people. 

This Alba Iulia, Romania. A 1735 baroque fortress. As you can see, the walls are designed to defend from both cannons and standing armies. In your world, the buildings in the middle will probably be even lower, and include a cellar\bunker, to provide better defense against aviation. 

The quality of metallurgy to create flexible cables was not present in the medieval period, so real medieval weapons with flexible components used leather or chain. A hollow blade structure with a chain through it would be quite large and heavy. A blade with a leather or fibre rope through it would be hard to keep together tightly as the rope creeps and expands or contracts with humidity, and prone to being severed if another blade came between the segments. Note that while flails existed including ball flails, and whips with light cutting blades scourges on them, heavy spiked balls on chains and other such weapons are fantasies which would be very hard to use without self harm. Also the weapon would fail to work as a sword except for light draw cuts. Thrusting swords require a high degree of rigidity to punch through armour. Heavy cutting swords rely to a large degree on the harmonics of the blade to transfer energy to the target and not the wielder's hand ( there is a node at the hand, a node at the target about 2/3 of the way along the blade, and antinodes about 1/3 of the way along and at the tip - this is called finding the percussion point and if you don't do it when hitting hard, it bounces off and you drop the sword or sting your hand). 

The Betamax era lasted 45 years. The Paleozoic era lasted 288,830,000 years. So basically as long as you like, depending what you think is significant. 

I'm writing a story set in a world with 3 moons and I have a couple of questions about how that would work. I understand that the tidal patterns would be significantly different than Earths and I'm writing that in as part of the story (wild oceans, unpredictable shores/ports). My question is what would be a logical setup for 3 moons? What I mean is, would one moon be the size of ours (which I understand is unique relative to moons on other planets) the second 1/5th, the third 1/10th ect? What would be a logical size differences between them to be functional (by functional, I mean functional to a "normal" sort of life on the planet)? I'm asking because I'd like to describe how they look at night in certain parts of my story. Also, how much time would pass between when the 3 moons established an orbit and to when one crashed into another? Millions of years? Billions? I'm curious as to this because I'd like to know if there is enough time since they all 3 arrived to have developed life and if there is enough time left over till the crash and cause mass extinction on the habitable planet. 

In my opinion, it would most definitely be the Centaur. A: Above average human intelligence and cognitive ability (in most mythical descriptions of them) B: A human body with arms and opposable thumbs (able to use a myriad of weapons) Ba: can use weapons and in theory has speed relative to his two potential opponents. Unicorn wouldn't stand a chance though I think the Pegasus obviously would being able to just fly away and all. Still, if the Centaur were skilled enough, he/she could just shoot the Pegasus with an arrow. 

Presumably they are 120 years behind us then, as most of your questions describe the state of this world in the 1990s. 

If all current forms of humanity are dying, then anyone with the technology to convert human consciousness into another form has the only hope. Such a technology is worth fighting for, as it is the only way to survive, even if in a different state. Post-humans will both be a goal worth gaining, or possibly in some circles worth destroying, or both (as many times what is forbidden for the populace is practiced by their masters). 

While the Earth's early, short term ships didn't have much radiation or micrometeorite protection, any long term ship has to protect its crew from hard radiation and micrometeorites. Current micrometeorite protection stops a 7.5mm aluminium projectile at 7km/s. That's of the order of a hundred times more energy than a bullet, though obviously if fired from the inside a bullet hits the pressure hull first rather than the shielding. Penetration depth of bullets is less than the penetration depth of hard radiation in most materials, including water which is the most likely near-future shielding. So a realistic ship might have a thin inner hull, a couple of meters of 'water' or ice for rad shield and crew use, then a micrometeorite shield. A bullet will penetrate the inner hull, but stop in the water after 30cm or so. Even without the water it would be stopped by the shielding. The water won't be very pressurised, so expect a bang and maybe a little splashing. Pseudo-gravity from centrifugal effects would mean the water would stay put; microgravity would mean the water might bubble out a bit where the bullet displaced it. If bullets can penetrate the hull of your spaceship then all your crew are already dead on a long term mission. By 'water' the load may get replaced with waste products as used, so the splash may be somewhat unpleasant.
