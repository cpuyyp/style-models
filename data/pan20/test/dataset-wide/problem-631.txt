Do they do this just because it looks cool? Or do they have to do it for stability reasons? EDIT: After hunting up a bicycle image of this effect, it's clear that it's a trick. 

I've heard a lot of folks complaining about freewheel hubs getting bent axles. I have a rigid BSO with a solid rear axle that I occasionally pound on local trails. I've never gotten a bent axle. That said, I only weigh 145 so maybe that's not saying much. Anyhow, I have a friend who doesn't weigh much more than me (maybe 160) who has gotten TWO bent axles. He never rides off-road, and his bike is nicer than mine. He has a QR rear axle. Is this a legitimate reason to avoid QR's on freewheel hubs? Has anyone bent a solid axle? 

My steel BSO has developed a creaking sound when I apply the front brake. I only hear it when I am beginning to brake, when there's not a lot of pressure being generated. I can recreate this sound by pushing the front wheel back with my hand, imitating braking pressure. All the sound happens while I'm going from no braking to very light braking. Going from very light braking to very hard braking makes no noise. I'm pretty sure the sound is either coming from the frame's head tube or the fork tube. I have inspected the frame and fork crown. No visible cracks. I replaced my very weak front brake recently, and I have been enjoying doing stoppies and stuff. Could this have started a crack somewhere? And if so, where is it most likely to be? Edit: After following some of the advice you guys offered, I have further narrowed it down. I do not have a suspension fork. My headset is not loose. The wheel is not the source of the creak. I have found that the fork tube is also not the source of the creak, based on the way the sound behaves when the bars are turned one way or the other. I am almost certain the noise is coming from the frame. Follow Up: I got it welded, and I haven't had problems since. 

That "rise and backsweep" makes it easier to handle the bike when standing up. You'll notice that this is more pronounced on downhill bikes. I am also uncomfortable on a flat bar, and I use bar-end bullhorns (I don't know if you could install these on a carbon bar). 

First of all, you need to rid yourself of the idea that "It can't be top-notch if it's made in China". Don't let all the cheap junk that comes out of China make you think they don't manufacture top-quality products. When you buy Zipps, you're not just paying for the decals... free-market competition sees that this doesn't happen, at least not much. Name-brand stuff is generally a bit more expensive, not necessarily because the brand can get away with charging more, but because the product generally passes through more middlemen, partially due to said name-brand being less specialized. If someone is selling "just like Zipp" wheels for $500, corners are obviously being cut. But if they are asking $1500, chances are they're probably just about as good as the Zipps. If there's no brand name at all, that's a bad sign. They're trying to avoid accumulating a reputation. I would never buy anything new if they didn't at least have an (English) website. So to sum it up, if the wheels are significantly cheaper (like $500), they're either heavy or dangerous. Or both. If the price is believable (more like $1500), it may be worth it if you do a bit of a background check on the company. 

That fork is aluminum. You usually only see steel (and sometimes carbon) forks curved like that. The only reason you would have a curved fork is so that it can absorb shock from the road... but doesn't aluminum fatigue when flexed like that? I'm contemplating getting this bike, because it's cheaper than a trek 1.1 (for example), while having better components. The fork is a concern. I don't mind having a stiff ride (which you generally get from AL forks), but I don't want to take any chance of it snapping due to excessive work-hardening. Any opinions? 

Take a look at these two aluminum frames. The first one is a $1k bike, and the second one is a $200 bike. 

I recently bought some cheap ($60) mountain bike shoes. It changed my riding style, and I'm really 'pedaling in a circle' now. I have a complaint though... when I sprint and put a lot of force into the other-than-down parts of the stroke, my foot moves around a lot. It doesn't feel efficient, and is rather annoying. If I tighten the straps enough that this doesn't happen, it really constricts my feet and isn't comfortable. 

My flagship BSO has a threaded headset. I recently discovered, to my surprise, that when I twisted the handlebars hard while restraining the wheel, I could move the stem. It isn't nearly loose enough to move while I'm riding, so I guess it's not a problem. The top bolt was tightened as hard as I could get it with one of those little bike tool hex sets (lever arm about 3.5 inches long). Are all threaded headsets like this, or is mine wonky? 

It is never okay for there to be "preload" on any bearing set. It causes them to wear out prematurely. Adjust it to where there's no play nor binding (or as close as you can get to it). Thank you for being sensitive to the obscure mechanical needs of your bicycle. The instructions are going to bias on the side of tightness, because most people will notice and complain about loose bearings but not tight bearings. And when the BB wears out after 20k miles, they won't know that it could have lasted 100k miles with proper adjustment. 

I find myself avoiding steep/fast downhills. Not because I'm afraid I'll lose control, but because something might happen to my bike that will send me face-first into the pavement. Are there any statistics on this? Edit------ By "crash due to bicycle failure", I mean a crash that would not have happened if something hadn't happened to the bicycle. This would include, for example, pounding your bike over bumps, resulting in the stem breaking. This would not include losing control because you pounded your bike over bumps. By "crash", I mean an accident serious enough to be documented. If you fall over at a stoplight because you couldn't unclip, that obviously won't be documented and therefore doesn't count as a crash. 

That's pretty funny. Here's my guess... Why: Seems like someone found themselves in need of an innertube and convinced themselves that, under the circumstances, it would be okay to take yours (also consider that this may be a prank). How: By removing the rear wheel, it would be easy to remove the tire, pull the tube, put the tire back on, and install the wheel again. This also means that it would have been easier for them to steal the whole rear wheel, reinforcing my "non-malicious intent" theory. 

Either your cones are coming loose, or the bearings are absolutely fried. I had this same thing happen to me when I was first getting into bikes. The hub was loose, I tightened it, I went for a ride, the hub was loose again. I finally got up the nerve to take the hub apart (yeah, I was pretty n00b back then). The cones and cups were damaged unbelievably. And a stray bearing was well on its way to eating through the axle. You've had the bike "serviced"... did they take the hub apart? If the cones are coming loose, you need to lock them in tighter and make sure that you're adjusting correctly (just loose enough that there's no binding. A little play is okay). In the case that the cups and cones are completely fried (at the rate that the wheel is coming loose, they would be completely fried), you need a new hub. 

Step 1: Get used to bailing out. Put your bike in first gear. Ride very slowly, then give a (small but sharp) upwards jerk on the bars as you do a hard downstroke on one of the pedals. Stay seated. You should have the power to pass the "tipping point". When you do, put your feet down so you don't fall on your butt. Do this until it feels completely natural and easy, and you have lost all fear of tipping over backwards. This is the real reason for this step, hopefully you won't be needing to bail out at all. Step 2: Learn to feather the rear brake. Now, instead of bailing out, give a light pull on the rear brake lever. The first time you do this, the front wheel will probably slam down uncomfortably. Keep doing it until you can save yourself from going over backwards but not so abruptly that you can't continue the wheelie. Step 3: Add speed. What's the highest gear with which you can reach the "tipping point" while staying seated? The higher the gear, the easier it is to sustain a wheelie. Bailing out is a bit tricky at higher speeds, but hopefully you'll never need to. Tips Doing wheelies on a long climb is a great way to practice while reducing the monotony. And you don't have to use the brakes to slow yourself down for the next wheelie. A front suspension makes learning much more pleasant. It makes landing so much more comfortable. Staying seated cannot be stressed enough. A wheelie is not a manual, learn the difference. When you're getting started with wheelies it might help confidence and control to lower your seat a bit, but make sure you still have the power to pop the front wheel high. 

I wouldn't consider anything over 140mm. beyond that, you're really messing up your geometry and endangering your frame. Keep in mind that your frame's limits are really determined by how much you weigh. If you're 140 pounds, the frame will take much bigger jumps than if you're 240. You say that the rear shock is really stiff. It seems there is an imbalance in stiffness between the front and rear suspensions. If you don't have the preload on your Suntour cranked all the way up, you should try doing so before upgrading. 

Relaxed geometry and high speed often go together off-road (think DH bikes). On the road, a $1200 CX is not going to be as good as a $800 roadie, but that's only because of the knobby tires. I think your best option is the road-mountain combo. If you wanted one bike to do both jobs, I think a mountain bike with ~1.75" semi-slicks would be better than a CX. Plus, that won't cost you $1200. A side note: No matter what you end up getting, you should buy used. You'll get much more bike for your money. 

I just bought a mountain bike with a Suntour XCM fork with lockout. Being a BSO rider, this is my first ever bike with a lockout on the fork. I will be riding trails, but most of my riding will be in an urban setting. The fork bobs and steals energy while I'm riding, so I figure I'll have it locked out while I'm on pavement. I ride aggressively, and I occasionally hit potholes. My previous bike was a rigid steel BSO. It took some hard hits while street riding, but nothing ever happened to it. This brings me to my question: How strong is the thingy that locks out the fork? Will it break if the front wheel takes a hard hit while the fork is locked out? 

Gummier tires (that won't last as long) have superior traction. As far as I am aware, that is the only advantage the KOM may have over you. On dry pavement, slicks have more grip than tires with treads, so your tires being "fairly slick" is not a bad thing. The fact that your time is almost double that of the KOM (that is a massive difference, even if he has stickier tires) probably means that you are nowhere near pushing your traction limit. The only piece of advice I can give you other than "get used to riding fast down hills" is to take the largest-radius path through the curve. This means starting on the outside, coming in to the inside through the middle of the curve, and then exiting on the outside. 

I'm restoring a Bianchi Sprint (~1975). It has a cottered crankset/bb. I was originally planning on replacing them, because we all know that cottered cranksets are junk, right? Well, they have a great Q-factor and the rings I want (52-42, because it's got DT shifters), so I'm looking at trying to make them work. I know cottered cranks are gone now because square taper is a better, lower maintenance, more foolproof system. But that doesn't mean that cottered cranks can't work well, right? Is it going to be an ongoing nightmare trying to keep these cranks working smoothly and silently? This bike would be used heavily (~100 miles/week). 

I am not familiar with resin, but I would suppose it has similar characteristics to plastic. From what I've seen, all the higher-end bbs use metal. Probably meaning that the only reason plastic is used is to reduce costs. As a competent mechanic who has changed many bbs, I would favor metal. I'm not worried about cross-threading, and greasing the threads removes the potential for corrosion. 

In the end, you generally get a better workout when you have a faster bike. This is because you usually end up riding more often/longer distances than you would otherwise. Also, riding fast is fun. And when you're having fun you don't notice the pain nearly as much. Just enjoy it and feed your speed addiction. You won't lose fitness. More likely you'll be extra motivated to get out and ride at 5 on a Sunday morning. The 'twitchy handling' is a geometry thing, your brain will wire up and you'll get used to it. 

Hydraulic lockouts can be activated on the fly. Mechanical ones can't (in theory), because you the fork has to be completely extended. I can activate my mechanical lock on the fly by pulling up on the stem with one hand and turning the lock with the other hand, but it's a little dangerous:) All forks can be unlocked on the fly.
