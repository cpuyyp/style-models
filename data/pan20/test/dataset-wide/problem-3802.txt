Unless I misunderstood the question, here is a counter-example: $d=3$, $k=2$, $f:\mathbb R^3\to\mathbb R^2$ is just a linear map, e.g. $f(x,y,z)=(x,y)$. Take $q=(0,0)$, then $Y=f^{-1}(q)$ is a straight line in $\mathbb R^3$. A generic 2-plane intersects $Y$ at one point. However there are planes containing $Y$ (and hence having infinitely many intersections), moreover these planes cover the entire space. So there is no ball $B_r$ avoided by such planes. 

Not all journals request copyright transfer, check journals' websites for their sample copyright forms. It actually depends more on the publisher rather than on the journal. For example, I recently signed a copyright form for one of the journals published by Mathematical Sciences Publishers. All my obligations are: (1) I don't sue them for publishing my paper; (2) If I publish it elsewhere later, I must acknowledge the prior publication in their journal. I don't think it prevents me from placing the paper to public domain later, although I doubt this would be a good idea. Having said this, I'd like to note that journals are irrelevant to the issue of disseminating your work. Just place it on arXiv before you submit it to a journal. Journals refusing to publish arXiv'ed papers (are there any such journals in math?) can be safely ignored and deserve to be ignored. If you care about legal matters, arXiv has an option of publishing under a Creative Commons Attribution license, which is almost the same as public domain for all practical purposes. 

The sum is zero for all $k<p^2-1$. Assume that $k$ is a multiple of $p-1$ and $k<p^2-1$. Divide all matrices into classes of the form $\{A,A+1,A+2,\dots,A+(p-1)\}$ . Summimg the $k$th powers over such a class yields $$ \sum_{s=0}^k A^{k-s}\binom ks \sum_{j=0}^{p-1} j^s $$ where $0^0=1$. If $s=0$ or $s$ is not a multiple of $p-1$, the inner sum is 0 mod $p$. If $s$ is a multiple of $p-1$ and $s<k$, then the binomial coefficient is 0 mod $p$. (This is what breaks for $k=p^2-1$.) The only remaining term is the one $s=k$ and it does not depend on $A$. So the sum over a class is the same for all classes. The number of classes is a multiple of $p$, hence the result. 

We need to check $\eta(u,v)+\eta(v,w)\ge\eta(u,w)$. Introduce coordinates $x,y,z$ so that the form is $x^2+y^2-z^2$. First, verify that there is a Lorentz map sending $v$ to $(0,0,1)$. Since it is an isometry, we may now assume that $v=(0,0,1)$. This is the main idea. For added convenience, you may also rotate the $xy$-plane so that the $y$-coordinate of $u$ equals 0. Next, observe that the formula yields equality in the case when the projections of $u$ and $w$ to the $xy$-plane are endpoints of a segment containing (0,0). This is straigtforward if you write $u=(\sinh a,0,\cosh a)$ and $w=(-\sinh b,0,\cosh b)$ where $a,b\ge 0$. Finally, rotate $w$ around the $z$-axis until it comes to a position as above. The product $u\cdot w$ grows down (it equals contant plus the scalar product of the $xy$-parts, since $z$-coordinates are fixed). Hence $\eta(u,w)$ grows up while the two other distances stay, q.e.d. Of course, for writing purposes the last step is just an application of Cauchy-Schwartz for the scalar product in $\mathbb R^2$. This was about two-dimensional hyperbolic plane, in higher dimensions just insert more coordinates (they will not actually show up in formulae). 

Enumerate all rational points outside your set. Then cover these points by open balls by induction as follows: the next ball is centered at the first rational point not covered so far, its radius is so small that is does not intersect $F$ and the previous balls and is chosen so that the boundary of the ball does not contain rational points. Then the complement of the union of these balls is path-connected: to connect two points, draw a segment between them and go around every ball intersected by this segment. Note that this works for any countable set, not just $\mathbb Q^2$. 

Here is a more general fact: if $J$ is central-symmetric w.r.t. a point $O$ (in our case, this is the intersection of the axes), then $O$ is inside. Indeed, let $D$ be the domain bounded by $J$. We know it's a topological disc. And it's central symmetric w.r.t. $O$. Now if $O$ is outside, then the symmetry is a map from $D$ to itself without fixed points, contrary to Brouwer fixed point theorem. If $O$ is on the boundary (i.e. on $J$), the the central symmetry is an involution of $J$ with exactly one fixed point. But there are no such involutions of the circle. 

This is not true even in finite dimensions. There exists a decreasing sequence of complete Riemannian metrics on the plane, pairwise Lipschitz equivalent, such that the pointwise limit is isometric to the standard sphere without one point. Then the completion is the sphere. To construct such a sequence, consider the metric of the punctured sphere in geodesic polar coordinates: $ds^2= dr^2+\sin^2 r\,d\varphi^2$ and add a term like $2^{-n}f(r)dr^2$, where $f(r)=1/r$ for $r$ near 0. This makes the distance to the origin infinite, so the metric is complete. But the additional term goes to zero as $n\to\infty$, so the limit is the standard metric of the punctured sphere. To make an infinite-dimensional example, take a metric product with your favorite contractible infinite-dimensional cell complex. 

One can show that $F(X)> c\cdot G(X)^{-2}$ for some $c>0$, provided that $G(X)$ is sufficiently small. Let $G(X)=\varepsilon$. Divide the square into $\approx(100\varepsilon)^{-2}$ small squares of size $100\varepsilon\times 100\varepsilon$. At least 9/10 of these squares must contain points of $X$. Indeed, if a $100\varepsilon\times 100\varepsilon$ square does not contain points of $X$, then it contributes at least $10\varepsilon(100\varepsilon)^{2}$ to the integral of the minimum distance, so one can afford only $(100\varepsilon)^{-2}/10$ such "empty" squares. Given that many non-empty squares, at least half of them are separated by the distance at least 1/10 from the origin and thus contribute at least $c\varepsilon^{-2}$ to $F(X)$. You get $F(X)\sim c\epsilon^{-2}$ if you choose $X$ to be a uniformly packed $\varepsilon$-net. And then you can enlarge $F(X)$ arbitrarily by adding many copies of some point (not at the origin). So you cannot get anything beyond the inequality $F(X)> c\cdot G(X)^{-2}$, at least in terms of orders of magnitude.
