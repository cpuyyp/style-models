$\def\Q{\mathbf Q}\DeclareMathOperator{\Gr}{Gr}$First, consider a Grassmannian $\Gr(k, N)$ of $k$-dimensional subspaces in an $N$-dimensional space. It is known that its cohomology ring is $$H_k=\Q[c_1,\ldots, c_k, \bar c_1,\ldots,\bar c_{N-k}]$$ modulo the ideal generated by homogeneous parts of $$(1+c_1t+c_2t^2+\ldots)(1+\bar c_1t + \bar c_2 t^2+\ldots +\bar c_{N-k}t^{N-k})-1.$$ Denote this description by (A). On the other hand, we can consider the quotient $$H_k=\frac{\Q[e_1, \ldots, e_k]}{(h_i|i > N-k)},$$ where $e_i$ denotes the $i$-th elementary symmetric polynomial in $k$-variables, and $h_i$ denotes the $i$-th complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial, i.e. $$\Q[e_1,\ldots, e_k]=\Q[x_1,\ldots, x_k]^{S_k}.$$ Call this description (B). Developing the $h$ in terms of $e$ shows that indeed both descriptions of $H_k$ coincide, cf. $URL$ §5, and the referenced equations. Passage to partial flag varieties Now let us instead consider $\Gr(k, l, N)$, the variety of subspaces $$\{V_k\subseteq V_l\subseteq V_N|\dim V_i=i\}.$$ It is known that its cohomology ring $H_{k,l}$ is $$\Q[c_{11}, \ldots, c_{1k}, c_{2,1},\ldots, c_{2,l-k}, c_{3,1},\ldots, c_{3,N-l}]$$ modulo the ideal generated by homogeneous parts of $$(1+c_{11}t+\ldots+c_{1k}t^k)(1+c_{2,1}t+\ldots+c_{2,l-k}t^{l-k})(1+c_{3,1}+\ldots+c_{3,N-l}t^{N-l})-1.$$ It admits inclusions from $H_k$ and $H_l$, coming from the map that forgets one subspace. This can be generalized for any sequence of increasing dimensions. My Question In the case where we consider the Grassmannian for one subspace, we could find the alternative description (B) in terms of symmetric polynomials. Is there a description (B) for $H_{k,l,\ldots}$? 

I think the title sums it up quite well: Is it a useful idea to define the Iwahori-Hecke algebra over a non-commutative $k$-algebra? If so, what shape should the relations attain? Bonus question: what would be the appropriate definition of the $q$-commutator $[A, B]_q = AB-qBA$? 

A frame is a complete lattice $\langle L,\mathord{\leqslant}\rangle$ which satisfies the following distributivity law: $$a\wedge\bigvee_{i\in I}b_i=\bigvee_{i\in I}a\wedge b_i\,.$$ A frame homomorphism is a mapping $h\colon L_1\rightarrow L_2$ which preserves finite operations and such that $h(\bigvee_{i\in I}b_i)=\bigvee_{i\in I}h(b_i)$. Every frame is a complete Heyting algebra, yet frame homomorphisms do not generally preserve Heyting implication. Could you please give me an example of such homomorphism? 

Suppose that the family $\mathrm{RO}(X)$ of regular open subsets of $(X,\mathscr{O})$ is a basis of $X$. Let the density of $\mathrm{RO}(X)$ (considered as boolean algebra) be $\aleph_0$. Does $X$ have to be second-countable? If not, what if we add regularity of $X$ (both $T_1$ and $T_3$ separation axioms)? If answers to both questions are negative, what is the maximal cardinality (relative to $|X|$) of the set of points not covered by dense countable $D\subseteq\mathrm{RO}(X)$? 

My questions is motivated by the following. $\mathrm{Proof}(x,y)$ represents derivability relation for Peano Arithmetic; in case $\mathrm{PA}$ is consistent there cannot be a PA-proof of `$0=1$'. So can I choose an arbitrary non-standard number $q$ to serve as interpreting the variable $y$ in $\mathrm{Proof}(\overline{\ulcorner0=1\urcorner},y)$ and satisfying the formula in question? Or is this interpretation determined in some other way? 

Consider first-order theory (with identity) of Peano Artithmetic built in the language $\{S,+,\times,0\}$ and with the following set of axioms: \begin{align} \neg Sx&=0\tag{1}\\\ Sx=Sy&\rightarrow x=y\tag{2}\\\ x+0&=x\tag{3}\\\ x+S(y)&=S(x+y)\tag{4}\\\ x\times 0&=0\tag{5}\\\ x\times S(y)&=(x\times y)+x\tag{6} \end{align} plus the full induction schema. Let $PA^{(-1)}$ be the subtheory of $PA$ (first-order Peano Arithmetic) which has all other axioms except for (1), similarly $PA^{(-2)}$ let be the subtheory without (2). It is rather easy, but nevertheless interesting, result that both this theories have finite models, $PA^{(-1)}$ even has the degenerate one-element model. My question is: has any research been made towards characterization of class of models of the theories above? If yes, could please someone provide me with suitable information? I am particularly interested in finite models. EDIT: Following J.D. Hamkins advice I explicitly stated the language and the axiomatization I am interested in. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ be an irreducible nondegenerate (i.e. not contained in a hyperplane) projective complex algebraic variety, and let $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ be the secant variety of $X$ (i.e. the union of all secant lines of $X$). Further suppose that the homogeneous ideal of $X$ is generated by forms $F_1,\ldots,F_m$ of degree two. How do I write the equations of $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ as a function of $F_0,\ldots,F_m$ ? Let us focus attention on the simplest case, i.e. when $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ is a cubic hypersurface. Then we have $\mathrm{Sec}(X)=V(G(x_0,\ldots,x_N))$, where $G(x_0,\ldots,x_N)=\sum_{i=1}^m L_i(x_0,\ldots,x_N) F_i(x_0,\ldots,x_N)$. The linear forms $L_0,\ldots,L_N$ depend only by $F_0,\ldots,F_N$, but how? Thanks. 

Let $F_0,\ldots,F_m\in\mathbb{Z}[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ be polynomials with integer coefficients and let $p$ be a prime integer. Consider the two ideals: $$I_0:=(F_0,\ldots,F_m)\subset \mathbb{Q}[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$$ and $$I_p:=(F_0\,\mathrm{mod}\,p,\ldots,F_m\,\mathrm{mod}\,p)\subset \mathbb{Z}/(p)[x_0,\ldots,x_n].$$ Is it true that $\mathrm{codim}(I_p) \leq \mathrm{codim}(I_0) $? Thanks in advance. 

Hello all. Let $X_{p_0,\ldots,p_n}\subset\mathbb{P}^N=\mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}}$ be the sequence of blowing-ups $\pi:\mathrm{Bl}_{p_0,\ldots,p_n}\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^n$ along $n+1$ points of $\mathbb{P}^n$ (maybe infinitely near points), embedded by very ample divisor $H_X\sim d\pi^{\ast}(H_{\mathbb{P}^4})-E_1-\cdots - E_n$ ($E_1,\ldots,E_n$ the exceptional divisors, $H_{\mathbb{P}^4}\in|\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^4}(1)|$, $d\geq 1$). If $p_0' ,\ldots, p_n'$ is another list of $n+1$ points that produces $X_{p_0',\ldots,p_n'}$ as above, is true that $X_{p_0,\ldots,p_n}, X_{p_0',\ldots,p_n'}$ are projectively equivalent ? Thanks. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P} _{\mathbb{C}}^N$ be a normal complete intersection. $X$ is called factorial if every Weil divisor on it is Cartier; equivalently if all local rings $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ are unique factorization domains. Is it true that if $$ \dim(\mathrm{sing}(X))<\dim(X)-3, $$ then $X$ is factorial? Thanks. 

Let $X$ be a noetherian scheme and let $Y$ be a closed subscheme of $X$. What relation is there between $\mathrm{Bl} _ {Y}(X)$ and $\mathrm{Bl} _{ Y _{\mathrm{red}}}(X)$ ? Thanks. 

Fix a natural number $n$. In $URL$ §3.5, Kang/Kashiwara/Tsuchioka define a (version of a) Hecke Clifford superalgebra. It is the superalgebra with the following generators: 

I omit the generators $e(\nu)$ in the following. $\nu$ is a vector of length $n$ whose entries are either even or odd. Among other relations (Def. 3.10 of that article), the crossing $\sigma$ and the even generator $y$ interact as follows: $$\sigma_a y_{a+1}-y_a\sigma_a = \begin{cases}1 & \text{if $\nu_a=\nu_{a+1}$ is even}\\ 1-\mathfrak c_a\mathfrak c_{a+1} & \text{if $\nu_a=\nu_{a+1}$ is odd}\\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ $$\sigma_a y_{a}-y_{a+1}\sigma_a = \begin{cases}-1 & \text{if $\nu_a=\nu_{a+1}$ is even}\\ -1-\mathfrak c_a\mathfrak c_{a+1} & \text{if $\nu_a=\nu_{a+1}$ is odd}\\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ The for the odd generators, $\sigma_a\mathfrak c_a=c_{a+1}\sigma_a$, and similarly for $\mathfrak c_{a+1}$. The other $\mathfrak c$ and $y$ are unchanged by $\sigma$. If we consider only the even case, then the divided differences $$\begin{split} \partial_a (x_a) &= -1\\ \partial_a(x_{a+1}) &= 1\\ \partial_a(x_j) &= 0~\text{for distant $j$}\\ \partial_a(fg) &= \partial_a(f)g + s_a(f)\partial_a(g) \end{split} $$ admit these relations. Question: How to make the above defining relations for $\sigma$ into a divided difference operator, and what are its properties? Attempt: Mimicking the even case, we can define $$\begin{split} \tilde\partial_a (x_a) &= -1-\mathfrak c_ac_{a+1}\\ \tilde\partial_a(x_{a+1}) &= 1-\mathfrak c_ac_{a+1}\\ \tilde\partial_a(\mathfrak c_j) &= 0~\text{for all $j$}\\ \tilde\partial_a(x_j) &= 0~\text{for distant $j$}\\ \tilde\partial_a(fg) &= \tilde\partial_a(f)g + s_a(f)\tilde\partial_a(g) \end{split}$$ Is this the only suitable definition for $\tilde\partial_a$? Is even a “useful“ operator? For instance, in the even case, $\ker\partial_a=\operatorname{im}\partial_a$, and their intersection for all $a$ are precisely the symmetric polynomials in the $y_a$. What is the correct replacement for “symmetric function” in the super-setting? Do they arise somewhere naturally? 

I initially asked this question at math.stackexchange.com but there was no reaction, so I thought this may be a good idea to transfer it to mathoverflow.net Let $\langle\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O},\mathord{\subseteq}\rangle$ be the complete Boolean algebra of open domains (regular open sets, these that are equal to the interior of their closure: $a=\mathrm{int}(\mathrm{cl}(a))$) of a topological space $\langle \mathbb{R}^2,\mathscr{O}\rangle$ (i.e. the Euclidean plane with the standard topology). Let $\mathcal{C}$ be the family of all element of $\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}$ which are convex in the standard sense, i.e. for any points $p_1,p_2\in c$, the closed interval $[p_1,p_2]$ is a subset of $c$. Let for any regular open set $\mathrm{hull}(x)$ be the convex hull of $x$, which is the smallest convex set $c\in\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}$ such that $x\subseteq c$. We define $\mathrm{hull}$ as the special case of the closure operator on the Boolean algebra: $$\mathrm{hull}(x)=\mathrm{int}\bigcap\{c\in\mathcal{C}\mid x\subseteq c\}\,.$$ My question concerns the existence of euclidean half-planes with respect to elements of the Boolean algebra. Let $H$ be the set of all half-planes in $\mathbb{R}^2$ without $0$ and $1$ ($\emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ itself). $H$ may be defined in the following way: $$H=\{x\mid x\in\mathcal{C}\wedge-x\in\mathcal{C}\}$$ where $-$ is the complement operation, in this case for $x$ it is $\mathrm{int}\,(\mathbb{Real}^2\setminus x)$. Let $+$ be the Boolean sum in the algbera $\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}$: $x+y=\mathrm{int}(\mathrm{cl}(x\cup y))$, $\cdot$ the Boolean product: $x\cdot y=\mathrm{int}(x\cap y)$ It seems obvious that in case we take $a,b,c\in\mathcal{C}\setminus\{0\}$ such that $a\cdot \mathrm{hull}(b+c)\neq 0$ then there is a half-plane $h\in H$ such that for all $x\in\{a,b,c\}$: $$h\cdot x\neq 0\neq -h\cdot x\,.$$ But can we replace in the above convex sets with arbitrary regular open sets? I.e. is it true that for all non-zero $x,y,z\in\mathrm{r}\mathscr{O}$ such that $x\cdot\mathrm{hull}(y+z)\neq 0$ there is a half-plane $h$ such that both it and its complement meets each one of $x,y,z$? I will be grateful for any hints of a solution. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P} ^ N$ be a smooth irreducible complex projective variety of dimension 3 (or better yet, dimension $n$). Is it possible to express the Hilbert polynomial of $X$ as a function of the degrees of Segre classes of $X$? If so, how? Thanks. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^n\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ be a smooth irreducible projective complex variety, $L\subset\mathbb{P}^N\setminus\mathbb{P}^n$ be a linear $(N-n-1)$-dimensional variety and consider the cone $Y=C_L(X)=\bigcup_{p\in L \atop x\in X} \langle p,x \rangle\subset\mathbb{P}^N$. Is it true that $Y$ is locally factorial (i.e. all its local rings are UFD) ? Thanks. 

Hi. Let $f,g:X\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ be two rational maps from a complex smooth irreducible projective variety $X$ to a projective space. Suppose that for every general point $x\in X$ we have $\overline{f^{-1}(f(x))}=\overline{g^{-1}(g(x))}$. Is true that $\overline{f(X)}$ and $\overline{g(X)}$ are isomorphic (resp. projectively equivalent) ? If not, is true that $\overline{f(X)}$ is smooth if and only if $\overline{g(X)}$ is smooth? Thanks. 

Let $X$ be a complex irreducible quasi-projective variety, $f:X\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ a morphism, $H\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ a hyperplane, $Z:=f^{-1}(H)$ which is irreducible, $Y\subset X$ a irriducible closed subset. Clearly we have $f(Y)\cap H=f(Y\cap Z)$, is it true that $\overline{f(Y)}\cap H=\overline{f(Y\cap Z)}$? EDIT: Moreover $Y\cap Z$ is irreducible (hence not empty). Thanks. 

Let $X$ be a nonsingular projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$, and let $\widetilde{X}$ be the blow-up of X at a point $p\in X$. What relationships exist between the degrees of the Chern classes of $X$ (i.e. of the tangent bundle of $X$) and the degrees of the Chern classes of $\widetilde{X}$? Thanks.
