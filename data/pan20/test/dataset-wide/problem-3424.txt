The world is a second-best place and so movements towards seemingly-freer trade may not always be a good thing. Classic example as told by Rodrik (2015): 

Conceptually there is no difference between (1) and (2). But in practice, (1) is more likely to be informal. Maybe the agreement between you and John is not even written down and is simply verbal. Or maybe it is casually scrawled on a scrap of paper. Whereas (2) is more likely to be formal. Indeed, officially, governments don't call it "borrowing". Instead, they say that they "issue bonds". Anyone in the "public" (including Joe on the street or the Chinese government) is free to buy these bonds. If say the bonds are one-year bonds that pay 3% interest per annum, then the government promises to repay the bond-holders $103M in a year's time. 

There are thus two complementary (and equally correct) ways to interpret any shift in the supply curve. (And likewise for demand curves.) 

Another perhaps distinct line of research is that initiated by Slovic and Lichtenstein (1971, etc.) and goes by the name of "Preference Reversals". These could arguably also be examples of incomplete preferences. The following example is from Tversky & Thaler (1990, JEP Anomalies article): 

Many basketball fans/players believe that having made several shots in a row, the next shot is more likely to go in. This is sometimes called the hot hand. Starting (I think) with Gilovich, Mallone, and Tversky (1985), it was "shown" that this was in fact a fallacy. Even if several shots in a row have gone in, the next shot is no more likely to go in than your average shooting percentage would dictate. Miller and Sanjurjo (2015) argue that the hot hand does in fact exist and previous researchers had simply fallen prey to a fairly basic statistical fallacy. Their argument is something like this: Flip a coin four times. Compute the probability that H follows H. To give a few examples: HHTT would have probability 1/2, HTHT would have probability 0/2, TTHH would have probability 0/1 1/1, and both TTTT and TTTH would be N.A. Miller and Sanjurjo's punchline is that the expected value of this probability is not 0.5, but ≈0.4. And the error made by previous researchers was to incorrectly assume that the expected value of this probability is 0.5. So if for example these previous researchers conducted the above coin-flipping experiment and found the average probability to be say 0.497, they incorrectly concluded that there was no evidence of a hot hand (not significantly different from 0.5), when in fact there was very strong evidence of a hot hand (significantly different from 0.4). My question is this: Are Miller and Sanjurjo correct that previous researchers failed to detect the hot hand simply because of this mistake? I have only skimmed one or two papers on this so I wanted to get some confirmation from someone here who might know this literature better. This seems like a surprisingly silly error to have persisted for three decades or more. 

Notes. "What exactly is OC?" This seemingly-simple question was discussed in the past (see e.g. Alchian, 1968). Then like many of the most important questions in economics, it was then forgotten/glossed over until Ferraro & Taylor (2005) and the susbequent literature spawned (see in particular the 2016 JEE Symposium). It all boils down to which definition you use. My view (and I believe also that of Alchian and Buchanan, 1987) is that the above definition is the "most correct" one that "everyone should use". Of course, whoever's marking your homework may disagree. 

Briefly googling, here is one explanation I found, but I was hoping an expert here could give a more detailed answer. 

Economists believe that higher growth rates tend to also mean higher inflation rates. So in this case what Mr. Green means is that 

†Note that this argument by Kaldor and Hicks is controversial, but is also one that most economists have gleefully latched on to, precisely because it is nearly impossible to ever have an actual Pareto improvement. Further reading: Feldman, 1998, "Kaldor-Hicks compensation". 

For a fuller understanding, contrast this to the more typical scenario where the supply curve is upward-sloping. 

Let $X$ be the number of possible baskets of goods that one can buy from a Walmart Superstore. Even if there were only 1,000 distinct items and we could only buy at most one of each item, that'd be $2^{1000}$ possible baskets. (Note that $X \gg 2^{1000}>10^{300}\gg10^{100}>$ "any estimate of the number of particles in the universe".) Even as a normative matter, it is debatable whether a perfectly rational being "should" have a complete preference ordering over these $X$ baskets. But as a positive matter, many (if not all) human beings will not have a complete preference ordering over these $X$ baskets. 

But this is not consistent with this BLS webpage description of this category of work. There is a photo of a professional-looking baseball player and also this sentence: "Competition for most professional athlete jobs will remain very strong." Another possible occupation title under which professional sports athletes might fall is "Entertainers and Performers, Sports and Related Workers, All Other" (27-2090, 27-2099), but here again we run into the same trouble. There are only 14,570 workers in this category and the 90th percentile hourly wage is only $\$36.35$. I'm unable to think of any other explanation. I'd appreciate help from anyone who is more familiar with how the BLS OES are collected and calculated. All data and sources used above are collected here. 

The opportunity cost of any decision is the value of the next-best alternative forgone. So in this case, if you choose \$40, your opportunity cost is \$30, because that's the value of the next-best alternative forgone. (Implicit assumption: These are your only three alternatives and you must choose one of these three.) 

Martin Feldstein (1997, p. 36) claims that workers within the US are more geographically mobile than say within Germany. I had known that US workers were mobile. But one sentence of his seems a bit hyperbolic: 

Perfectly competitive market: Numerous participants, so that no single participant has any influence. 

Yes, we can say that on average, each Indian saves 30.2% of income. But this average is not necessarily very meaningful. For example it may be that the vast majority of Indians spend all of their income on consumption and it is only a tiny minority of the wealthiest Indians who do the saving. 

Chang and Rodrik merely try to argue against the extreme position that free trade is always a good thing for everybody and in favor of the modest position that protectionism has sometimes "worked". 

Small mistake #1: What capital is The author identifies "bonds, real estate deeds, stock certificates" with "capital" (p. 5). But in mainstream economics, capital refers not to these, but to durable goods that can be used to produce other goods and services. It may be argued that this is a mere quibble, since the author is communicating to a mass audience and in everyday parlance, that is what people think of as capital. Unfortunately, "capital" recurs throughout the comic and is, indeed, a key component of his arguments against free trade. He frequently conflates "capital" in the fuzzy, ill-defined layman sense and "capital" in the more precisely defined sense that is used in academic economics. For example: On pp. 5-6, capital is depicted as pieces of paper ("bonds, real estate deeds, stock certificates") that China owns. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "the risk of death reduces the value of a statistical life." †At least under the simplest approach, which ignores other important considerations like risk aversion and the discrepancy between willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept. 

I'm not an expert on this, but as a Singaporean, here are some factors off the top of my head (plus some Googling), explaining why Singapore is different from other first-world countries (in terms of revenue and expenditures). 

This is a forced retirement savings scheme. In Sep 2015, the CPF had S\$293.9b in total members' balances (source). That's about 75% of GDP. This is another frequent gripe of Singaporeans because these savings are all locked up (with very draconian rules on how you can gradually withdraw small amounts after you're 55). Moreover, these funds are "managed" by the various Singapore sovereign wealth funds (GIC, Temasek). GIC in particular is not well-ranked in terms of transparency (source). So it is unclear as to how and how much exactly these help to contribute to Singapore government coffers. 

Brandis (1967) argues that "absolute advantage does not exist" and "that it is a logical impossibility". (See also comment, comment, reply.) My question here is very narrow and specific. I do not understand why the highlighted sentence below (from p. 172) is true. Brandis seems to be claiming that the last 5 units of Product Y cannot possibly cost 5 units of capital and 15 units of labor. But I do not understand why this is not possible.

Direct investments. Portfolio investments. Financial derivatives (other than reserves) and employee stock options. Other investment. Reserves. 

Therefore, producer surplus for the marginal unit of the good is \$0.50 - \$0.50 = \$0. However, producer surplus for earlier units of the good is >\$0 (we produce them at <\$0.50 but sell them at \$0.50). Therefore, (total) producer surplus (which is the sum of producer surplus for each unit of the good) must be >\$0. (Here I would also draw the graphs to illustrate but "ain't nobody got the time for that".) 

She is initially very reluctant to express a preference for either alternative. So one possible interpretation is that she is exactly indifferent between A and B. Another is that she does not obey the completeness axiom. However, she is then pressed further and told that if she doesn't choose, she'll simply be given alternative C: "Send both children to the gas chambers." Faced with this alternative C that is clearly inferior to both alternatives A and B, she then does indeed choose one of the alternatives (B: Send her daughter to the gas chambers), hence strongly suggesting that she does indeed obey the completeness axiom. The above is of course merely my interpretation of the story in Sophie's Choice. Maybe someone can give an alternative interpretation where the above turns out to be an example of the completeness axiom being violated. (One possibility might be along these lines: Sophie's preference relation is incomplete over {A,B}. When faced only with A and B, she doesn't prefer A to B, doesn't prefer B to A, and isn't indifferent between A and B. However, when given an additional option C that is vastly inferior to A or B and which she must default to in the absence of a choice, she now prefers B to A.) 

Pareto Axiom. (This is just the usual: If everyone prefers lottery $p$ to $q$, then so too does society. And if everyone strictly prefers lottery $p$ to $q$, then so too does society.) Separability. Invariance. Anonymity. (Again, this is just the usual, though a small technical adjustment may be necessary.) 

The last class of examples is of the Sophie's Choice variety. Not surprisingly, these examples are pursued largely by philosophers who argue (contra economists) that there is a real distinction between indifference and incomparability (or incommensurability, though naturally philosophers split hairs over whether these two terms are the same). Putnam (1986) 

Please answer with reference to the above example. Please make use of economic logic and also how the above would actually be done in national accounting. 

This might explain the low estimate for mean annual wage. However, this would fail to explain why the 75%-ile wage is listed at only $\$89,780$. 

GNP = GDP + Primary Income (PI). So it is possible that PI falls, GDP stays constant, and GNP falls. PI is often called "net income from abroad" (especially in older textbooks). Examples of PI: 

In the IMF BPM6, BOP simply refers to a statistical statement (think of it as a piece of paper or an Excel spreadsheet) that records, in summary form, all of the country's international transactions. The BOP never refers to a number. Hence, there is no such thing as a BOP surplus or a BOP deficit. The three accounts in the BOP are the Current Account (CA), the Capital Account (KA), and the Financial Account (FA). In theory, it is always necessarily the case that: CA + KA + FA = 0. (In practice, we have to add an "errors & omissions" term.) Hence the name balance of payments. The above balance of payments identity must always hold. Unfortunately, not everyone follows the IMF's recommendation. This causes a lot of confusion. 

In a democracy, 40% of the population are farmers while 30% are factory workers. What sort of trade policies are likely to be enacted? Why are bridges to nowhere built, while potholes on busy roads left unrepaired? 

The Balance of Payments (BOP) records, in summary form, every single international transaction.* Also, the BOP uses a double-entry accounting system, where every entry MUST be balanced (hence the name) by an entry (or entries) that is (or are together) equal and opposite. In your example, say an American consumer buys \$1,000 of sashimi from a Japanese fisherman. The American consumer pays with cash (could be in USD or JPY, doesn't matter too much here). Then under the American BOP, the sashimi import is recorded as a debit (-\$1,000) under the Current Account (CA). And the cash is recorded as a credit (+\$1,000) under the Financial Account (in particular the "Other Investments" sub-portion of the FA). To repeat, the BOP MUST add up to 0. Whenever you enter one entry in the BOP (say in the CA), there must be an equal and opposite entry somewhere else (often this will be in the FA, but it can be anywhere, including even in the CA again). Sometimes just to make sure that the BOP adds up to 0, the balancing entry can be a bit contrived. But the above is not at all a contrived example; it is a very standard and clear-cut one. Footnote *: Of course, in practice, these are errors and omissions. Which explains why there is an "Errors and Omissions" component added in the BOP. 

The Japanese and Korean car and steel industries are often touted as examples of successful infant industries. I'm trying to find some famous examples of failed infant industries. (They don't seem to show up easily on a quick Google search, so it would perhaps seem like there are not many such examples?) 

The stock market is not a representative sample of the entire economy. For example, it is perfectly possible that one neighborhood of a city consistently gets richer faster than the rest of the city, perhaps because ever-richer folks keep moving into that neighborhood. It is likewise possible that the stock market (which does not exactly reflect the entire economy) consistently attracts ever-more-successful companies. (This is just one possible reason for selection bias; there may be others.) 

Society consists of Ann and Bob. Society must choose between alternative $x$ and alternative $y$. Ann prefers $x$ to $y$ while Bob prefers $y$ to $x$. Which should society choose? 90% of the population will benefit greatly from a nuclear plant. The remaining 10% will die a horrible death. Should society build a nuclear plant? 

Rightward shift: At every price, producers are willing to produce and sell more units of the good. Downward shift: In order to get producers to sell any given number of units of the good, we can offer them a lower price. 

These COEs ("Vehicle Quota Premiums") make up 6.0% of government revenue. Besides this very expensive piece of paper, a car-owner still has to pay all the other usual taxes (GST, road taxes) and insurance, plus a lot of unusual fees (e.g. Electronic Road Pricing - an idea which London borrowed). A lot of these flow to government coffers. Together, these make Singapore easily the most expensive place in the world to own cars. 

Of course, the value of the sesterti must itself have fluctuated over the centuries it was in use. And so if I must narrow it down, I am particularly interested in its value during 

I wasn't sure though what or when he was talking about and was hoping someone could tell me. Googling a little I find that during the Revolution there was a Law of the Maximum, but this doesn't sound like what he was talking about. 

The first two of the above statistics imply that total wages paid out to these 11,710 workers was 11,710 × $\$80,490$ = $\$942,537,900$ or a bit under $1b. But there is a discrepancy between the above figures and the salary figures across the four major US professional sports leagues. The following are the latest annual salary figures from various sources (these shouldn't be too inconsistent from salaries a year or two earlier). 

Mayer gives an example of his distinction between information, knowledge, and wisdom: The observation that unemployment is at 6% provides information. The comprehension that this figure has to be interpreted in the light of changes in the number of discouraged workers, the labor force participation rate, the NAIRU, etc., provides knowledge. Whether this unemployment rate justifies an expansionary fiscal policy requires consideration of vaguer issues (e.g. measurement errors, policy lag). It also requires value judgments. That is, it requires wisdom. 

P.S. There is of course the difficult question of who or what exactly the "community" is. If I may add my humble opinion, all of this sounds very illiberal and even mildly fascist. Which is perhaps why this concept hasn't been much taken up by mainstream economics. P.P.S. The above is merely Musgrave's interpretation. As Musgrave himself says:
