Basically it all comes down to respect. Respect the space in the way you'd like your own space to be respected by others, and everything will be fine! 

My coworkers and I decided to start doing a 30 second max effort "workout" every hour to help us keep from getting too "desk bound" and to add a little bit more volume to our normal workout routines. We only have bodyweight for these movements, so we're thinking of doing things like push up variations, inverted rows (on the sides of our desks), squats, situps, that sort of thing. We're not sure if we should pick a body part per day and do variations on it, or if we should do a different body part per 30 second session. We're trying to think of a routine for hourly exercises. We'd need eight exercises (one for each hour that we'll all be here). Any suggestions? 

If there was no pain before you started running, you're probably overdoing it. A mile and a half really isn't much, and your cardio ability might be there, but your soft/connective-tissue ability might not be there. That stuff takes a long time to recover and strengthen. Also, if you've never run before, your musculature is probably wacko and imbalanced. This is also something that will not develop overnight. If it's bad, it can also really jack up your form. Form, by the way, is another thing you should investigate. If you heal-strike when you run, you'll be in for some serious trouble. Think about scraping dog poop off your shoe when you run, or pulling the heal of your foot up to your butt. (You don't want to look like you're prancing like a show horse, but just be cognizant of the muscles in the back of your thigh.) Also think about spending as little time on the ground as possible -- meaning get your foot up right away. These cues should help with form basics. If you ask me, it's better to run fast for short intervals with good form than run slow for long intervals with bad form. That said, yes, I know, it really sucks. When you start running, you'll definitely find your aches and pains will slow you down more than your cardio-level will. Nobody wants to take it slow when they're doing something they enjoy. But it's important to get a good base so you can keep it up for a long time! So, try following a training schedule like Couch-to-5k that will help you gradually on-ramp. It will give your connective tissues a chance to progress at a healthy rate. If you're really chomping at the bit to get in more cardio during off-days, I don't see any reason not to add low-impact activities like biking, paddle-boarding, or rowing to the mix, so long as it doesn't exacerbate your pain. Regarding the inflammation: we aren't allowed to play doctor here so it's not our place to make medical recommendations. But lord knows what kind of issues you could be having there. Your buddy is right, ease-up and reset. Start a logical training progression and it'll probably go away, but definitely visit a doc otherwise. 

If you burn 2000 calories a day and eat 2000 calories a day, 1500 of which you eat before bed, your body composition will remain constant. There's no fooling thermodynamics. 

Sometimes when I'm squatting around maximal loads, I notice what could almost be described as a doppler shift in the music playing from my headphones for a brief moment. The music (maybe my perception of time?) seems to "slow down" slightly, or everything is processed more slowly. This happens during instants of extreme exertion. This is a strange question, I know, but has anyone else experienced this? If so, what scientific explanation could there be for it? Any potential harm? 

Though this is a bit off topic, I was interested so I did some research. There are a number of scholarly articles on the subject (actually, this is a just a small subset -- look for yourself). Let me summarize some for you: Red meat consumption and mortality: results from 2 prospective cohort studies: (source) 

You need a structured routine so that you don't give up after 30 minutes. There are some good training programs on the web for running 10k such as: 

Yes, you will see improvements, but they will be slow. The residual training effect table on exrx.net (found here, screenshot below) describes how the body retains changes in body state and motor control after ceasing to exercise for a certain time period: 

The table shows a 15 day (+/- 5 day) retention period on strength endurance. This is defined as: slow twitch fiber hypertrophy, aerobic/anaerobic enzyme activity, local blood circulation, lactate tolerance. Also shown is a 30 day (+/- 5 day) retention on maximal strength. There are a number of medical references on the webpage for further reading. See also detraining muscle mass, which states: 

That's pretty normal. Everyone tends to favor one side or the other -- usually your dominant side will be stronger. One side may always be slightly more toned than the other, but you can make the difference much less noticeable by doing alternating unilateral movements such as weighted lunges, step ups, pistols, split squats, etc. 

Thick saliva forms in your mouth because of evaporation, not because your body shuts off its saliva glands. By taking a quick glance at the makeup of saliva, it's easy to deduce that when saliva condenses (when water evaporates from it), what remains is mucus. The saliva remaining in your mouth during heavy exercise is thick and slimy because it has a higher concentration of mucus. The reason much of the water in this saliva has evaporated is because your mouth closes much less frequently during heavy exertion (also leading to less sympathetic stimulation) and you respirate much more frequently -- both of these contribute to more rapid evaporation. Standing outside on a cold day will give you an idea of how much water you expel each breath. Whether or not you spit it out is your choice. Personally, during heavy exertion I only spit if the saliva starts to impede my ability to breathe. 

The movement you're describing is hip adduction. You're exercising the hip adductors, which are thigh muscles that pull your legs together. I can't find an image of a bodyweight version of the exercise you're describing, but here is an image of the weighted exercise: 

Calorie calculators can't tell you exactly how many calories you need to eat -- they're making a lot of assumptions about your metabolism, activity level, etc. While tools like the Harris Benedict Formula are useful, they are generalizations -- everyone is different. Not to mention, your activity level and metabolic rate will vary from week to week due to all kinds of stimulus you may not be able to control (stress levels, weather, relationships, sleep, and so on). You should use a calorie calculator as a baseline and do your own study from there. The easiest way to do this is to buy a skin fold caliper (~$8 on amazon) and start a spreadsheet. Use the calipers to measure your bodyfat, and weigh yourself every day or week. Keep track of how many calories you're eating using something like fitday (or tallying the calories yourself). Keep this data logged and make adjustments on a weekly basis. You can dial in your daily caloric needs by observing for a couple of weeks. If your weight and bodyfat don't fluctuate over the duration, you can average the number of calories you ate to determine your daily needs. At that point, you can increase your calorie consumption by about 300-500 per day for the duration of your bulk. If you find you are putting on too much body fat, you can tweak these numbers. I realize that reading "couple of weeks" can be off-putting because we want a solution right now. But remember that there is no instant gratification in fitness. You can't get a six pack overnight, nor can you squat 405 overnight. Be scientific, be patient, and your results will reflect your effort.
