It seems qualitative requirements of such a World Language have still not been mentioned. Other qualifications: The (as yet) failed Esperanto shows that pure rationality is not the sole issue. (I am both Esperantist and anglophile.) 

The English perhaps: can happen, and the Dutch misschien (geschieden): might happen have similar roots. The German vielleicht seems to deviate on first sight, but there is the Dutch wel-licht with the same meaning: "yes easily (possible)" - wel = indeed, yes, yeah (compare the English well). Both vielleicht and wellicht stem from the same spoken form evidently. 

English spelling did deteriorate, due to almost abruptive historical changes. It will never become phonetic (nation versus national), and we won't see much reform there besides through/thru. So evolution is not an automatically proceding process. We live with a much richer language in qualitative terms. Philosophics showed the historical introduction of a Greek notion for (non-religious) soul (Latin animus). So nowadays we have a bag of notions like creative, tolerance, open-minded. Nevertheless philosophy, or psychology did contribute nothing to our linguistic mental toolset describing mental processes themselves. We did not become better argumentators. And are still as gullible to wrong arguments (financially supporting child raising, despite world over-population; energy saving lamps, despite very toxic waste). Despite better expressiveness. So the meta-level of language did not evolve. It is interesting in this respect to look at the artificial language Esperanto. (I am Esperantist and anglophile.) The language can be seen to correct many of the grown short-commings of evolution: instead of the many suffixes to make a word adjective (-al, -ic, -ive) or noun there is just one -a or -o. The spelling is again phonetic. Rules are few and without exception. A linguistic evolution in general has no such opportunity to make a clean break. Modern Hebrew was such a forced effort and might be worth readding upon. In general language evolution is a process of growth, friction and fitting. Missing are aspects of the biological evolution that made so good survivors: hunt, competition for the same resources, colaboration, genetic reproduction. Hence language evolution is nothing to be overly optimistic about. Especially as there is a large qualitative equality between languages. Historical or otherwise. 

Lat. nē 'really, true' and Tocharian B nai 'indeed, surely' seem to be the IE-parallels. The IE demonstrative *(h1e-)no- 'he there, that one' sees to be the root according to Beekes (with a questionmark though) and Babiniotis. 

The word kin 'hate, venom, spite' is quite unusual and took my attention for its meaning 'venom'. Is it an Anatolian-Turkish/Azeri only word or is it common in other Turkic languages? Does anyone know of any commentary on its etymology? 

The Altaic hypothesis is far from dismissed. There are publications out there regarding the Altaic family and there are still voices within major institutions (e.g. Brill) speaking of it. Wikipedia as a source for linguistic concensus has deteriorated over the past years. I am not for or pro the Altaic hypothesis, I am just stating that "dismissed" is largely exhagerated. You could say that the Altaic hypothesis containing Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic is far more accepted than the Macro-Altaic hypothesis including Japanese and Korean. 

And you can see that in this, the mass/collective noun 'butter' is unmarked for the collective form but marked for the singulative formation, with distinct morphology from the plural formation and the 'replacement pattern'. In the example given above, and others typical of the tripartite system, for a noun like 'bell' the underlying form is a singular, with a morphologically complex plural, while the morphologically unmarked and thus underlying form of ‘butter’ is plural/collective/mass both grammatically and semantically. A singulative noun is typically a word that denotes an item that is singled out from a mass or group of similar items. Items that normally occur in pairs or larger numbers are expressed by nouns that are semantically and grammatically plural or collective and morphologically not overtly marked. For a noun like 'loincloth', with the 'replacement pattern', both forms a morphologically complex, and neither may be underlying. Of course, the semantic distinctions made by speakers of a particular language are crucial to determining how a noun is treated for number marking. This is discussed quite a bit in this paper by Dimmendaal on number marking and noun classification in Nilo-Saharan (2000) (access via an institution). He argues that that there is a continuum between 'object' and 'substance', with the end points of this continuum being universally distinguished (i.e. the most 'county' count nouns and the most 'massy' mass nouns), but with intermediate cases being "linguistically malleable" across languages. This is not just true for, say, Nilo-Saharan languages compared to Indo-European languages - it can be true for even very closely related languages, because there is an enormous amount of variation in how these systems work (particularly in the parts of Africa relevant to the Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan language groupings, where there are large amounts of linguistic transfer between languages which are geographically close but genetically distant). Dimmendaal also gives examples from some other languages which show structural similarities to the the singulative marking patterns in the tripartite systems of Nilo-Saharan, such as Russian gorox 'peas', gorošina 'pea'. In the Native American language Kiowa, nouns which are inherently singular or dual take a number suffix to mark plural, while other nouns which are inherently dual or plural ('bone', 'rib', 'wing') take a singulative marker. So, basically, mass nouns are 'marked', or indicated, by virtue of being morphologically unmarked but having a clear singulative counterpart, and unique noun morphology. The above points do not take into account the complex interactions between noun classifier systems and number marking in Nilo-Saharan languages, nor external ways of indicating the 'mass-ness' of a noun (the classificatory verbs discussed by @Daniel Briggs) - there are also many other ways to indicate this beyond the noun morphology. 

As to the definition wikipedia, agglutinative language Esperanto indeed is highly-agglutinative. And "malsanulejo" (there exists a hundred year old alternative, but rare, "hospitalo") indeed is often cited by both the pro and contra E-o factions. Having the same stem and same endings for deriving adjective , noun , verb () is one property. For E-o this has a funny effect on the "internationality," but assumedly makes the language easier for members of other language families. The "highly" makes only sense with sufficient affixes being used: 

Fundamental language differences are rare. Considering the existence of plural maybe allows over-generalisations, hence ethnic prejudices. That would be a bit far-fetched argument. W.r.t. normal variation of speech: non-objective monikers like terrorist / rebel / freedom fighter, that far more influence our mental state. Nevertheless for speculations enjoy a bit of science-fiction classics: Null-A from A.E. van Vogt, and The Languages of Pao of J. Vance. Having a regular number-forming systen is said to help in arithmetic: short / single syllable digits, regular (10+3 / 7x10, Esperanto) as opposed to thirteen / seventy. I doubt there is a measurable effect for adults. 

I always look into this one Mallory, J.P. and Adams, D.Q., 2006. The oxford introduction to proto-indo-european and the proto-indo-european world. Oxford University Press on Demand. On page 464 there is a table with the sound correspondences in different major IE-language groups. There is a digital copy of that table (+ an addenda) here: Basic sound correspondences between PIE and the major IE groups 

My pick would be: Mallory, James P., and Douglas Q. Adams. The Oxford Introduction to Proto-Indo-European and the Proto-Indo-European World. Oxford University Press on Demand, 2006. There is a great lexical material inside, including sub-groupings of Indo-European e.g. Graeco-Aryan etc. The style of writing is literally 'easy reading'. I like the book a lot and so do people who bought it if you judge from the reviews. 

I often see IPA representations of words (e.g in Wikipedia) that render the American accent of English (instead of British). Is there any agreement on which English accent IPA should render or does it depend on the authors native accent?
