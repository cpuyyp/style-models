It seems to me that Boole expresses here a view that was common in his time, of Language as a natural phenomenon, and of Logic as the somewhat idealized structure of (adequate) reasoning. Language may have a theory of its own, based on observation, and because the mind spontaneously reproduces abstract forms in Language (which is why Logic as a human endeavor is possible, to begin with), Language can be instrumental to (a theory of) Logic, insofar this theory is produced by Language-speaking humans. Such a theory of Logic, existing nonetheless independently of Language, could in principle be realized by a different kind of mental process, one that is general enough for abstract reasoning, but not necessarily embedded in Language. He could be hinting at the possibility of "logical machines", that would be entirely within the scope of the speculations of that time. I don't know enough to explain how far has he gone explicitly in that direction, but we all know how instrumental his work has been to the development of the thinking machines we have today. 

In defense of what is sometimes called "obscurantism", particularly in philosophy, it can be said that reason proceeds sometimes by disruption, radical irreverence, noise. It is easy to see that not all said obscurantists are of the same caliber. The same can be said of the defenders of clarity. That said, this is not what the authors you collectively refer to as "postmodern" (a denomination that is, itself, quite... obscuring), particularly Baudrillard, are advancing in their work. They are writing at a time when their readership has largely assumed that consensus in philosophy has already failed as a project, so it can be said that criticism of their work as "hard to read" largely misses the point. Poetry was never a stranger to philosophical thinking. 

I would start answering this by pointing out that, even if it is syntactically meaningless, it would be dangerous to assume it is semantically meaningless. Wars have been fought over those two words, expressed in many many languages. In the most basic parts of language, syntax catches up with semantics. When forming a language, the need for concepts proceeds the creation of the syntax (at least it appears to do so for the early phrases). Virtually all cultures (if not literally all cultures) support the concept of a Self (which can be exactly as slippery as you worry it is). This concept proves useful enough that it was given a single-syllable utterance (whether as a word "I" or verb conjugation). Consider: entire schools of philosophy have arisen to combat the question of "what is the self?" because the "self" is such a useful semantic concept to have in virtually everything we do, and yet it does prove particularly difficult to pin down to a syntactic definition. 

From there, one could challenge the givens, which some of them are quite demanding ("perfection must exist for imperfection to exist" is a really hard one to defend), but that gets into the discussion of whether or not the argument is sound, which is outside of Philosophy.SE for sure. I'll stick to discussing the structure of the argument. 

The validity of an appeal to authority depends on what forms of justification are accepted for a statement. In some extreme cases, the only acceptable justification may be a First Order Logic proof based off of agreed upon axioms. In such a case, an appeal to authority is not an acceptable justification. However, in many cases, we accept a justification which is less complete than this. We may be in a hurry, and not have the time to vet a logical argument ("When I say jump, I expect you to jump, and only pause to ask 'how high' once you're already in the air!"). Or perhaps we may have some minimal question about the validity of our axioms ("Are we 100% certain we'll go to heaven when we die?"). The rules of logic are notoriously fickle about dealing with axioms where there is any degree of uncertainty. For an excellent example from mathematics, one can look at the debate over the Axiom of Choice. The Axiom of Choice seems highly intuitive, but has some behaviors which are so extraordinarily counter intuitive that many abandon the axiom all together. So what do you do in these circumstances where one cannot use some crisp clean logical proof, for one reason or another. Given that one cannot prove the claim, what other "good" solutions are there which don't depend upon a proof? One may consider the power of belief in such a search. It is trivial to come up with scores of examples where the belief that something is true leads to a desired outcome, even if that something was not actually true. Of course, it is also trivial to come up with scores of examples where the results of said belief end spectacularly poorly. However, it points to an alternative to being able to prove an argument. If one can defend the claim that believing in that argument is "good," potentially by arguing that the outcome of such a belief would be good, then one may win the argument. One wins the argument not by proving themselves wrong, but by convincing the other party that it is no longer in their interests to fight. The validity of such arguments is founded in their ability to cause "good" results through the belief in an idea, whether or not that idea was true. If you completely reject such arguments, you are limited to beliefs which are logically provable, and there are some serious complications to consider some time down the road. An Appeal to authority is one such example. In many cases we come across in our lives, we simply do not have all the information needed to create a decisive logical argument. Worse, we've observed that it is very easy to create proofs involving false axioms to convince us, because we lack the fundamental background to weed the true axioms from the false ones. I can't count the number of times I've seen an anti-gun argument that starts from the assumption that taking guns from law abiding citizens will also take them away from criminals. I can't count the number of times I've seen a pro-gun argument that starts from the assumption that taking guns from law abiding citizens will have no effect at all on gun owning criminals. I do not have the background to tell which argument is right, and have a gut feeling that the answer is somewhere in the grey region between. However, I have a suspicion that others may know information I do not (this suspicion is reaffirmed on a daily basis... or an hourly basis on particularly bad days). Someone else may have the information I need. The only question remaining is how do I identify the correct person's opinion to "believe to be true?" An Appeal to Authority is one approach to this. The idea is to identify a person who: 

It seems that we have many questions in one here, and my answer is certainly one of many possible. I'd like to quote Charles Sanders Peirce, from an article called "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities" ($URL$ where he states his disagreement with the Cartesian principle of universal doubt: 

In this account, qualities of things do not stand on their own, and are also not memories of sensations, but are those elements of reality that can be traced back to sensations, but only as they are abstracted from them, and then rearranged in units of existence that we synthetically call objects of the world, thanks to the presence of signs of reality, which are paradoxically those that cannot be seen, or remembered, by themselves. Interestingly, it is exactly because they are not directly based on sensations that experiences can endure. It is because we have an involuntary (and largely unconscious) theory of reality that we can add coherence to our sensations. 

I do not dispute Conifold's answer, but would like to add a different perspective. As I see it, and according to what could be understood as a fundamental tenet of structuralist and post-structuralist conceptions of language, it is not just that what constitutes language is how people speak, but also that the human condition itself is created in and through speech. What still intrigues me about your question is the conjugation of objectivity and independence of manifestation. As was conjectured by the comment from David H, only in pure mathematical terms can these two demands be met. In other words, "facts or features of language that exist independent of anyone's actual speech" are a matter of logic, or, if you include virtual manifestations of language (as Peirce has proposed) of theoretical semiotics. In any case, linguistic realism is perfectly compatible with an empirical study of language, it actually would benefit greatly from the absence of Plato from the scene. 

From this we can see where the interesting bits are. If you want to unsettle the Turing fanatic argument, don't look for the complex, look for the simple. Look for the simple things which are assumed by the other to be self evident, and simply ask them to be consistent and provide a definition for them. I love pairing Guy Steele's speech with a quote by a character in the Robert Heinlein book, Stranger in a Strange Land: 

There are varying assumptions, as not everyone agrees on what science is. However, there do seem to be some common patterns. Indeed, the first common assumption is that "there are patterns in reality." We don't often think of this as an assumption, but science is basically useless unless there's some pattern to test. To this end, there is a focus on that which is repeatable and reproducible. This assumption takes on two different forms, depending on where one is going with the science. The lesser form would be "patterns in reality which are repeatable and reproducible have value/worth." This is required for science to be a worthwhile activity. The stronger form would be "That which is not repeatable or reproducible does not have value/worth." This would be used as an argument by those who believe science is the only path to value. The idea that "there are no miracles" is fundamentally captured in this wording. If there were indeed miracles, and they had value/worth, then one could state that science misses something important. A second axiom, which is somewhat related is "that which matters can be measured." Science operates on data. If that which matters cannot be reduced to data, science has a very hard time operating on it. This axiom also splits into two forms, depending on how severe of a wording is desired: "This which can be measured have value" is the lesser wording, and "That which cannot be measured has no value" is the stronger. The third fundamental axiom that I'd name is "The value of a theory which has not been proven false asymptotically approaches the value of a true theory." Fundamentally, science relies on falsification of incorrect theories to propel itself forward. Theories which have not been falsified are given credibility, which approaches the credibility we give to truth. In it's simplest sense, this is Popperian falsification, but if you look into how that credibility is provided to these non-falsified theories, we see the patterns that philosophers such as Kuhn saw. 

To discuss the honesty of the doubt - which is not to argue directly against the doubter as a person, but to require (in abstract) the doubt to be genuine, i. e., not just plausible, but actually existing as an affection. That stance is present in some arguments against cartesianism, for instance, and can be applied to the present case. To argue that even in the absence of certainty, action is still inevitable, and so is responsibility. The refusal to take action based on lack of certainty is unjustifiable, in the same way breaking the law can't be justified by ignorance. As a consequence, doubt is not enough of a reason to proclaim "business as usual"; this attitude must have grounds of its own, and the evidence to support them. 

The choice of style reflects the need for Spinoza to imply his reader as deeply as he could into the seriousness of the matter at hand. Not just a search for precision, but a plea (and a demand) of austerity. The Ethics is not a commentary(!) and what is more distant from commentary than a mathematical demonstration? The work is a serious and direct challenge to the powers of its time. As little as possible could be left to chance, and this had to be made explicit to a reader that was being invited to a risky journey, possibly without return. 

Keep in mind that genes are causally related to phenomena occurring in many levels at the same time: molecular, cellular, systemic, individual, social, even environmental. The interplay of all these different levels is not without attrition. More often than not, the existence of a particular trait cannot be reduced to a single explanatory principle. Your premise - that there's nothing to be gained from positive affections on the individual level - is probably unwarranted in itself, but also suffers from a limitation in perspective, as the best utilitarian explanations for the existence of emotions are probably those that investigate the phenomenon at the social level. 

By that definition, your first question is easy: "But then if a field of inquiry is able to provide accurate, objective and useful information regarding a question, doesn't that field simply become part of science?" The answer is "yes, because you defined science to be as such." What I do find interesting is the natural corollary to this, which is that science cannot answer questions which cannot be phrased objectively. Subjective questions are those whose answer must necessarily be relative to the self. By the definition provided, science cannot answer these questions because science only answers objective questions with objective answers. Science can peel layers away from the Self, but it cannot actually reference it per the particular definition we are using here. Doing so would violate its objectivity. One question which must be important, by this definition, for which science cannot have an answer is "Are there any questions which cannot be phrased objectively that matter to me?" Such a question is inherently subjective by my word choice. I have found sidestepping this sort of question particularly tricky, so there is a high likelyhood that it qualifies as "a question science can't answer" from your point of view. 

In four lines of work, we immediately get our result. ~(P&Q) is not the same as (~P&~Q). You can do this for any logic, and it saves a lot of time waiting for answers from StackExchange! What you are actually looking for is DeMorgan's law: ~(P&Q) -> (~P | ~Q). Note that the operation changes from AND to OR. 

We understand the anthropomorphic set of values better than we understand those of larger sets. Thus, we can make better decisions centered around our own viewpoint. This naturally happens whenever we use subjective terminology. The importance of personhood or selfhood in this argument is that most such debates tend to presume the golden rule (a human value, mind you) is a good thing. Thus, if we claim we should go after our values, the golden rule suggests that it we should respect others going after their values as well, but we have to understand what those words mean. Typically, this is boiled down to the idea that a "self" can have values, and a "non-self" cannot. I do note that the "current ecological crisis" does not automatically challenge humans acting in human interests. That argument has to be made separately. It looks like the question you came across starts from the assumption that "anthropocentric" means "humans first" not "humans in the center." If you only consider anthropocentric viewpoints which put all values of humans above all values of non-humans, you drastically limit the number of options you are looking at. 

The substance (of which Spinoza will later state that there is only one, and that it is God) is truly known by the intellect, in its essence, from itself, and by itself, through its attributes. That there are a multitude of attributes is not contradictory to the fact that the substance they express is one: 

That would be my formula. You might say that this would be a futile endeavor, that to ask "what is...?" questions is as trivial as orange juice, and needs no justification, but I would have to disagree with you on that precise point. You may not believe me, but there was a time when the verb to be, with the meaning that it has today, didn't exist. It is possible to think without it, and without asking "what is...?" questions. At some point, to be became a part of some (not all) human languages. The ancient Greeks tried to understand what it means in a purposeful and systematic way, and the rest is the history of metaphysics. 

The definition of the Church-Turing's thesis is an attempt at capturing the intuitive idea of effective computability or "things that can actually be calculated". It has been said that it is not something to be proven, or refuted, but important assumptions underlying scientific work in many fields of research rely on some version of the thesis, one important case being the linguistic assumption that the semantics of natural languages can be formalized in any significant way. Considering that it is unfalsifiable, should the Church-Turing's thesis be given such an important role in scientific research? EDIT: Thanks for the attention. In response to some of the criticism that the question has received, I'd like to add that, 

When starting to push the bounds of consciousness and life, nailing down definitions becomes important. Unfortunately for us, both of those words are particularly tricky to come up with a definition. Call it the human condition. One approach would be to define consciousness not as a "thing" but as a metric of a system, and what we traditionally call "consciousness" is actually more of a threshold on that metric. I point to the longstanding debate over the consciousness of animals as a rationale for this definition. If "consciousness" is not a thing that one has, but some critical-value score on a metric, it becomes easy to see how some could disagree on what that critical-value is; some could consider a dog "conscious," while others may not. If such a metric could be named, then taking the limit as consciousness approaches 0 would begin to model systems which are not-conscious. We could then try to find such a system which admits a concept we can call "doubt" without consciousness. I do think it would be difficult to doubt that we are conscious, even with such a definition. Consider the original phrase "can we doubt that we are conscious." The Wikipedia answer for consciousness is an awareness of an external entity or internal state. By that definition, "we are conscious" would be an internal state, and thus any phrase which is formed with that phrasing will force consciousness by definition. A definition which does allow that phrasing for unconscious beings would, at the very least, force Wikipedia to change its definitions. 

He is really leading his audience on here, but he isn't being unfair. The oldest philosophical problems deal with whether the world is real. Any such debate can cause his argument trouble, so he instead uses this challenging statement to drive home a point: he is only using introspection. He could have worded this much less aggressively (most philosophers agree with him: the meaning of life would be a lot easier to spy if it was available via introspection).
