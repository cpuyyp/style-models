A windmill may not produce enough "power" to work a pump depending on location, how much wind is blocked or scattered by building, and it might get scavenged for its materials by raiders so wind may not be the most reliable way to get stuff working(depending on the setting) I'm assuming the survivors will need to wander off into farming as well to be able to eat, and as humans are lazy, they will use mules/horses/cows to till the soil(even if the soil is inside a building with a glass roof or mirrors set up) Now if you'd occasionally hook those cows and mules up to a water pump the settlers built out of wood or metal if they have proper metal working tools available for the water crisis sets in. $URL$ and have those pumps pump the water up to a big water tank, which is relatively easy to build out of wood, you only need your work animals to work once in every x days until the water runs out. That way you can get the animals out of harms way and "hide" the pump for marouders. You could even dig it in the ground and then cover it up. These animals could also be used to automate washing for the people living there $URL$ and of course power grinding stone for grinding grains and other materials. They can also used to power machinery with leather belts. $URL$ or generate electricity with it. Small amounts, but perhaps enough to help with building up an electrical grid up with windmills/watermills etc... Basically, by first utilizing animals, they could short circuit the industrial revolution within a few years if they manage their resources correctly and focus on getting power from windmills/water mills as soon as possible on large scale. When there's power, water, electric light, they can grow crops galore, which they can trade with other settlements and get an economy back up and running. They can smelt metals with electricity and get iron working back up and running. 

Hereunder is the initial unfortunate attempt to connect Earth and Mars, resulting in Earth's atmosphere leakage to Mars. By regulation, next gates were enforced to be located in outer space and limited gravitation/magnetic fields. 

As stated, your target is to organize information. And that is usually not a trivial task : information elements are linked to others, may be linked to space and/or time. So you can have different axis : you can for example use a geographical map to locate things in space, a timeline to organize them in time, some family tree coupling time and relationships between siblings, etc. Depending of the level you want to achieve, it can be quite a lot of information to keep in your head. You may want to use some tools to organize this. It can be simple notebooks and papers, or some software (I can think of the great Tiddlywiki here ; feel free to add suggestion in comments). If you are building this for a world or game, do not push it too much, as the world is mostly a recipient for your story, and not an end by itself. Structure your information around the hero or center of the story. As a side note, you can maybe find inspiration for both content and organization in some gaming systems like Microscope. 

I see a some issues here: The maintenance of a ship is not negligible, especially in water and without advanded technology to build it. On earth, non-steel ship were made of wood. And sea lifeforms can severely damage wood over time. You usually have to repair holes, change some parts, and this is usually done by taking the ship out of the water. Doing this on a gigantic moving ship seems quite impossible without some handwaving here (magic, unknown material...) The size of the ship is significant. Low estimates of the area needed to feed an adult with a 2300 cal vegetarian diet are 0.44 acres (total 4400). Medieveal urban density is about 60 people per acre, so this would be small (170 acres) compared to the food area. So food production and houses for 10.000 people would require 18.5 sq. km (4.3 x 4.3 km). This is not completely unrealistic, but it cannot be a classical ship: sea faring would break the structure. It would be loosely coupled parts bound together, a kind of floating city and gardens. Such structures exist, including floating gardens, for example on the Inle Lake. But lakes have less constraints that seafaring: even modern ships can be broken or severely damaged by wave. A floating city would be at great risk. And once your gardens are full of salty water, no more tomatoes. First conclusion is that it is unrealistic: unsustainable, engineering nightmare, fragility. Not sure how you can fix this without some special material here... 

There are several alternative food sources, that could allow for rebuild afterwards. Mushrooms and fungi can serve as a nutrition source, and hell is there a lot of dead plant matter for them to feed on after the plantopalypse. Back in the days of yore there were huge fungi on the earth, I imagine the same will happen again with the rich nutrition soil available to them. Then there are insects. Gods are there insects. Not the nice pollinators, they'll die. Goodbye bees, goodbye butterflies. But the mulch eaters, roaches, woodlice, etc... Fancy a nice roach burger? Also, just as the virus has adapted, some plant life will also adapt. It's very very hard to get 100% eradication or success. Hence Monsanto, Bayer and the other poison manufacturers have to keep improving their poisons. There will be a few hardy plants that'll survive because they're different, get a defense for the virus, that could lead to a rebound in a few hundred/thousand years. Also, assuming this is seen worldwide as a "Real ****ing problem" that will push aside all differences, and causes worldwide collaboration on fixing the issue. They identified that it's a virus so they still have viral labs, they'll set quickly on establishing labs finding its weaknesses/attachment proteins and modifying plants that don't have those with worldwide cooperation. I will assume billions of moneys will be spent on making this happen "F.A.S.T."(Find Alternative to Starvation Threat). Because everyone is sick and tired of Roasted mushroom with a woodlice sauce on a bed of cockroaches after a few years. How would these plant labs operate? They completely isolate seed vaults with very very strict sanitizing procedures to enter or leave. All material will be blasted with gamma rays to kill any traces of the virus, the material will only be released when the grass placed with the material in quarantine survives for a week after good air circulation and exposure to the material. Then they set up their virus manipulation labs near there to modify the precious seeds to survive the virus by eliminating attachment points where the virus can attach. They'll release these plants in the wild, so they can evolve further in nature to became hardier against the virus. All iterations get tested in the wild and what sticks is allowed to spread further and further, making sure as much of the world gets their "patch of green" to allow it to spread and germinate and adapt as quickly as possible. So by using mushrooms as alternative food sources, a select few animals can be preserved that can digest them. Small animals will be bred to be able to eat and digest them, a lot of animals will automatically run to the bountiful mushrooms to start eating them instead of plants. Those that survive will be the basis for the new natural order. Nature will find animals to fill the abandoned spots in the life cycle. There will be mass extinction of many species, but a lot of herbivores in moderate climates will survive, especially if human aid is provided by teaching the animals to eat mushrooms. So with good coordination, and a few smart minds, there is a possibility to survive. Maybe the cows can survive off mushrooms too, with some insects for protein, then we can still have steak! 

For a rather hard-science based sci-fi setting, I am checking for faster-than-light (FTL) possibilities. One option that I consider is the following: Interstellar travel is achieved through portals. They can be imagined during their construction as two giant rings initially superposed. Once finished, they are separated but have a remarkable property : they behave as a "tunnel" in space. Something watching or entering in the space circled by Ring A will see or exit through Ring B. No special effects or anything fancy : both parts of spaces are "simply" connected and behave accordingly. After that, you can move Ring B to anywhere in space, at slower-than light speed. Even if takes a few hundred years to achieve, you can end-up connecting stars or regions of space, building a web of connected portals. This system makes the portals key elements in my setting (for obvious strategy, communication, and trade/economic advantages) and avoid some FTL. I'd like to have Worldbuilding reader's feedback on this : 

You can push this by thinking about lifeforms that are so different that they will not be spotted easily. A few examples : 

Water is composed of elements that are very common in the universe : Hydrogen (rank #1) and Oxygen (rank #3). This makes water (H2O) one of the most common molecule in the universe. So from an economic standpoint, its choice as currency is definitely not a good one. In the solar system, most water will be found as ice. It may contain other organic molecules in comets or asteroids, or some other components on planets & satellites (salt, etc.). If you need it to be pure, you'll probably have to refine it somewhat. 

A combination of surface tension and static electricity might do the trick. Imagine a ceiling made out of a mesh of thin hair like rods with the same refractive index as water. These rods are close enough so the water bonds between it due to surface tension and doesn't fall down. Same like brushes can hold liquids and it doens't fall down(below a certain volume of course) 

In the universe there are several worlds where energy harvesting is feasible without pesky wild life habitat preservers standing on your patch'o land bare breasted. So earth has set out to harvest energy from other worlds to keep earth green and blue and open for free range nature lovers. Through a lucky invention we found out a way to very quickly(near light speed, 0.99c) transport material and people through the universe, we just haven't knacked a way to get off a planet in an energy efficient way yet so we still use these days rockets to get off this rock) In a reasonable timespan Earth has set up some bases on several worlds to gather energy. Thermal energy from volcanic active worlds(like io), tidal energy from oceanic worlds(europa), wind energy from planets with an active atmosphere(venus). We also have some nuclear reactors buried in the moon, just to have something close, but keeping it supplied with water and fuel and crew not dead has been a hassle so on other worlds has been chosen for reneables. Scout missions are under way or building already on remote worlds in different solar systems, but sadly we haven't heard back yet. The world will be roughly the same as ours, except maybe a hundred years in the future or a bit more, but not much has changed in energy needs except that fossil fuels are out and all is electrical. The energy need that existed in fossil fuels is now replaced by the equivalent in electrical. How do they get the energy off the planets on the way to earth in a way that the energy price on earth would not differ from what it is today, and the energy need stays roughly the same(see the led light suprise, leds are brighter, more energy efficient, so naturally we use more because it costs the same). Some options I thought of: Huge lasers through space reflected by satellites to a specific point on space to boil lots o water for steam power and water desalinization and salt production. Cons, might be hard to keep the beam focused over large distances. Energy pods: Concentrated energy in batteries. Might be to costly to launch those in space, cons: heavy, weighs a lot, how do we get it on earth without it burning up or poisoning the lands on a faillure. Fusion produced helium3: There are reactors powered by the planets that produce helium3 thats shot to earth where it's used in reactors to generate energy. cons: You need launch and gather mechanisms, costs a lot for possibly little gain. Which would be most economical, or is there a better way to keep earth green and cat videos on the internet? 

A "swarm" of small black holes may do the trick. Note that such swarm is highly unlikely to exist naturally as it would collapse, so it should be a creation of some advanced civilization. Such swarm would be devastating locally (when swaying across a planet or star), move at the speed you want, and have not special effect from far away, just the usual gravitational impact of their mass. The exact size of these small black holes is to refine depending of the effects you want to achieve. The size of the swarm is also quite open. The stability over time of such swarm may need some handwaving, however. And well, regarding where it comes from... ... let's say that it is a minefield from of a Kardashev type III civilization ! 

Non-carbon based biochemistry implies the ability to create long molecular chains. The more common alternative mentioned is often silicon (silanes), but other candidates may exist : boranes, sulfur... The liquid necessary for life support could be ammonia, sulfuric acid, formamide, hydrocarbons, or liquid gas (nitrogen, supercritical fluid hydrogen). None of these alternatives have however be observed, and carbon-based chemistry seems to be the best competitor : longer chains, fast reactions, etc. From projectrho, here is an exemple of macromolecule/solvent combination (at 1 ATM, temperature in °C). 

Identification for better protection. If from a social specie, or at least one taking great care of its eggs, the eggs would be better nurtured. In this case, the bio-luminescence could also be used as a way to communicate the egg's needs (warmth, moisture, etc.). Identification as a warning. The eggs could be highly toxic and poisonous for predators, or have other defense mechanisms (an electric egg ?). This special signature would keep predators at distance, like some animals using very visible colors. Identification as a trap. The eggs are easily spotted by some wannabe-predators, only to see the latter being stick to the egg and dissolve by some digestive liquid dripping from the egg. Or the egg need to be eaten to reach a parasitic form that is an intermediate step in its growth). This could also be combined with 1. where care-taking adults use the eggs to attract preys closer.
