I am looking for a list of the irreducible representations of O(2). Could someone please provide a reference? EDIT: I am particularly interested in the representations on IR^2 (irreducible or not) 

Thanks to Bill Johnson! My question is easily answered by a direct application of the closed graph theorem (one shows that the diagonal is closed in the mixed norms). Unfortunately, I did not have this one as an exercise in my functional analysis class! 

This one is analogous to an Ramras' answer: Donaldson's theorem from the 80s and the corresponding Seiberg-Witten stuff. 

This is a follow-up of a question of mine with a similar title. I am interested in Morse homology (on Hilbert manifolds), more specifically with "generic" perturbations of the metric tensor (under the heading of "transversality"). The space of perturbations to use should have the property of separability in order to apply the Sard-Smale theorem. Now comes the question, which is supposed to help me in these matters: Let H be a separable Hilbert space and let B be the closed unit ball in H. Is the space C^b(B), the space of continuous bounded functions on the closed unit ball endowed with the sup-norm, a separable space? The previous question of mine replaced B above with an open subset of the Hilbert space. Then the answer turns out to be NO. Notice that if H is finite dimensional, the answer is YES. 

Centralizers of various types of subgroups, and their relationship to invariants like the cohomology of the classifying space $BG$ has a long history of study, at least going back to the papers from the 50s by Borel and others. EDIT: Changed what's below to a more limited statement. I don't know a reference to your exact question, but the following more limited statement is true: Theorem: A compact connected Lie group G has the property (**) "For every elementary abelian $p$-subgroup $H \leq G$, $C_G(H)$ is connected" if and only if $G$ has torsion-free fundamental group and has a finite cover isomorphic to a product of copies of $SU(n)$, $Sp(n)$, $S^1$ for various $n \geq 1$. In particular, if you in addition assume $G$ to be simply connected, the only examples are products of $SU(n)$ and $Sp(n)$ for various $n$. Sketch of proof: 1) The condition is necessary: If (**) holds holds for all elementary abelian p-subgroups $H$ for all p, then every elementary abelian p-subgroup has to be contained in a maximal torus. By a result of Borel this implies that the fundamental group is torsion free. One easily checks case-by-case that the exceptional groups and Spin(n), $n \geq 6$ cannot be involved in $G$ since they have non-toral elementary abelian p-subgroup (which remain so even after modding out by a central subgroup). This leaves the cases above. 2) The condition is sufficient: We just have to check that the centralizer of an element of finite order of a group as above will again be a group of the same form, which I think you can do by hand. -- Further info: The groups in the list above are exactly the ones whose classifying spaces have integral cohomology rings a finitely generated polynomial algebra. In fact any polynomial ring which occur as the cohomology ring of the space has to be of this form --- this is the so-called Steenrod problem, whose solution is described in Andersen-Grodal: The Steenrod problem of realizing polynomial cohomology rings. J. Topology 1 (2008), 747-760. (DOI: 10.1112/jtopol/jtn021). Also, see Andersen-Grodal-Møller-Viruel The classification of p-compact groups for p odd. Annals of Math. 167 (2008), 95--210, in particular section 10+12 for a summary of the relationship between subgroups of $G$, their centralizers, and cohomology. Our setup is more general in that paper (we study p-compact groups), but it contains references to the papers of Borel etc. 

I'm interested in a family of properties of connected simple graphs that comes up in percolation theory. Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. Now consider the set of subgraphs of $G$ that I will call "cores". A core $C$ of $G$ is a connected subgraph of $G$ with the property that upon "removing" $C$ from $G$ the resulting graph has no edges. I define "removing" as deleting from $G$ all vertices and edges in $C$. Note that a core is not the same as the induced subgraph of a connected dominating set (which makes reference only to the vertices of $C$ and not its edges). For example, the triangle graph has 1 core which is the triangle graph itself, 3 cores that are chains of 3 vertices, and 3 cores that are chains of 2 vertices. The properties are defined by sums over all the cores: $f_k(G)=(-1)^{v(G)+1}\sum_{\mathrm{cores}\, C\in G} v(C)^k (-1)^{e(C)}$. Here $v(C)$ and $e(C)$ are respectively the number of vertices and edges in $C$, and $k$ is a non-negative integer. I've proved that $f_1(G)=0$ for every connected $G$ except for the 1-vertex graph, for which $f_1=1$. I therefore do not need a name for property $f_1$. What about $f_2$? Here are some special cases. When $G$ is a tree with $n>1$ vertices, then $f_2(G)=0$ unless it is a path; for that case $f_2(G)=2$. Now consider cycles of length $n$. For these the $f_2$ values are $n(n-1)$ . For the complete graphs $f_2(K_n)=n!$ . Perhaps these special cases will help someone make the connection with a known property. Addendum: I welcome suggestions for a better term for what I've called a graph "core". Here is a rewording of the definition, in case there is still confusion. A core $C$ of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ induced by a subset of the edges of $G$ and which has the following two properties: (1) $C$ is connected, and (2) every edge of $G$ is incident on a vertex of $C$. It's not obvious from the definition of $f_k(G)$ that these integers are always nonnegative, but I believe this is true for all positive $k$. Is $f_k(G)$ counting something in $G$? If so, then the definition in terms of cores (and the naming problem) can be avoided. 

Even for $n=1$ the cofiber will almost never be a loop space. There is no reason for it to be a loop space, and plenty of reasons for it not to be a loop space. E.g., it would need to be a simple space, its cohomology would need to be a Hopf algebra,.... These are usually not satisfied in examples; see the comments, eg. Chris' example $RP^2$. What Presma studies for $n=1$ is the different question of when $f: X \to Y$ is part of a fibration sequence $X \to Y \to Z$ not a cofibration sequence. (These only agree in the stable range.) Is this what you are really after? I agree that there should be a higher version of that theory. 

No, this is in general quite far from being true (and also somewhat ill-posed, since there is not a natural candidate for what "=" means since there is no map). For example, take $M = S^1$ and $N=S^2$, both with the antipodal $C_2$-action (which you can view as either right or left action). Then $M/C_2 \simeq S^1$ so $H_*(M/C_2 \times N;k) \cong H_*(S^1 \times S^2;k)$ as graded groups. But $C_2$ acts as $-1$ on $H_2(N)$ and trivially on $H_*(M)$ so $H_*(M \times_{C_2} N;{\mathbb Q}) \cong H_*(M \times N;{\mathbb Q})_{C_2} \cong H_*(M;{\mathbb Q}) \cong H_*(S^1;{\mathbb Q})$ as graded abelian groups, where $C_2$ on the outside denotes coinvariants. 

A somewhat lengthy calculation, involving integrals, reveals that the probability an $n\times n$ Hermitian matrix, drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble, is positive definite, decays as $\left(\sqrt{3}\right)^{-n^2}$ for large $n$. I can’t say what decay constant I had expected, given the context, but it certainly wasn’t $\sqrt{3}$ ! Is there a deeper or more direct explanation for the appearance of this number? 

The central limit property of $h$ follows from the main result of: David Freedman and David Lane, "The Empirical Distribution of Fourier Coefficients", Ann. Statist. Volume 8, Number 6 (1980), 1244-1251. They show that all the Fourier coefficients (not trivially related as complex conjugates) are asymptotically independent. 

Consider the random variable $S=(s_0, \dots ,s_{N-1})$, a sequence of signs uniformly distributed on the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^N$. We are interested in $N$ large and prime. The Fourier transform $\hat{S}=(\hat{s}_0, \dots ,\hat{s}_{N-1})$, where $$ \hat{s}_q=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \zeta^{q k} s_k, \qquad \zeta=e^{2\pi i/N}, $$ defines a new multivariate random variable. Finally, consider the univariate random variable $$ h=\left(\prod_{q=1}^{N-1}\hat{s}_q\right)^\frac{1}{N-1}=\left(\prod_{q=1}^{(N-1)/2}|\hat{s}_q|^2\right)^\frac{1}{N-1}. $$ This variable is the scaled algebraic norm of the cyclotomic integer whose coefficients are $S$. I would like to prove that $h$ has the central limit property for $N\to \infty$, that is, its distribution becomes increasingly concentrated at one value. The plausibility argument goes like this. Consider a "baby" estimator of the variable given by the geometric mean of a fixed number $M$ of the $|\hat{s}_q|^2$, instead of all $(N-1)/2$. For this fixed number of Fourier transform components we have a multivariate central limit theorem, for $N\to \infty$. When we apply CLT and compute the covariance matrix, we find that these $|\hat{s}_q|^2$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. The baby estimators therefore have the central limit property for $M\to\infty$. Unfortunately, the $M\to\infty$ limit of the baby estimators may be a different random variable than the $N\to \infty$ limit of $h$. 

Note that a group like $GL_n(\mathbb F_p)$ of course would be in $\mathcal L_3$. Whether it is in $\mathcal L_1$ depends a bit on which $\mathbf G$ you are willing to start with. Now, you may want to limit the class in $\mathcal L_2$ in some way to ensure that it is not larger than $\mathcal L_3$ and avoid the "pathologies". I would be surprised if there was a good way to do this, without referring back to $\mathcal L_3$: The main problem, I think, it that there is no really good "purely group theoretic" way of e.g., specifying that you only allow extensions "on top" by diagonal automorphisms (not field or graph), without getting back into the Lie theory. This is at least what goes wrong in the $SO_{2n}^+(\mathbb F_q)$, $q$ even, case. (Derek also hinted at this.) You may also, conversely, argue that $\mathcal L_2$ is anyway too small, since it is not closed under iteratively putting things "on top" and "on the bottom"; to be "almost" of Lie type should be a bigger class... The cleanest fix for this is to go all the way and study the groups which are virtually a finite group of Lie type, i.e., has a finite index subgroup which a finite group of Lie type. Now, this class of groups is however of course just the class of virtually trivial groups, aka all finite groups... This is not as silly as it sounds, since many deep open problems in finite group theory, such as Alperin's conjecture and its cousins, stem from the philosophy that all finite groups behave almost like finite groups of Lie type.... 

Hadamard matrices may be characterized as $n\times n$ real orthogonal matrices $U$ that achieve the lowest possible "energy" as defined by the (scaled and shifted) entry-wise 1-norm: $$ E(U)=n^2 -\sqrt{n}\,\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n |U_{i j}|. $$ We'll consider only those $n$ for which Hadamard matrices exist; their energy is zero. I'm interested in the minimum energy "barrier" between distinct Hadamard matrices. Let $U_0$ and $U_1$ be distinct Hadamard matrices and $U_t$ a continuous map from the unit interval to orthogonal matrices (a "curve") with these matrices as endpoints. The energy barrier, for this curve, is the maximum over $t$ of the energy: $$ \Delta E(U_t)=\max_t E(U_t). $$ Finally, define $\Delta E$ as the infimum of energy barriers over all curves that join any pair of distinct Hadamard matrices. $\Delta E$ is easily bounded above by $90^\circ$ Givens rotations (as curves) that have the effect of swapping two rows or columns of a Hadamard matrix; the maximum energy, at the halfway point, is $(2-\sqrt{2})n$. Is this bound sharp, or are there smaller barriers? 

Consider the random variable $S=(s_0, \dots ,s_{N-1})$, a sequence of signs uniformly distributed on the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^N$. With the Fourier transform we can define $N$ random walk variables $$ \hat{s}_q=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \zeta^{q k} s_k, \qquad q=0, \ldots, N-1, $$ where $\zeta=e^{2\pi i/N}$ and to keep things simple we take $N$ to be prime. As we take $N\to\infty$ all of these have normal distributions: $\hat{s}_0$ on the real line and the others in the complex plane. I would like to be able to claim that these random variables become independent as $N\to\infty$ in a certain qualified sense. First, since $\hat{s}_q$ and $\hat{s}_{-q}$ are complex conjugates we only consider $q\in\{1,\ldots,(N-1)/2\}$. Second, I am only interested in "fixed-information" counterparts of these. We define these random variables as $f(\hat{s}_q)$, where $f$ maps the complex plane to a finite set. For example (in fact the case that generated this question), $f$ might be take the magnitude of the complex number and round it to 7 significant digits, or to $\infty$ if the magnitude exceeds a certain bound (in order to keep the cardinality of the range of $f$ fixed as $N\to\infty$). Is it true, say for particular kinds of fixed-information maps, that $f(\hat{s}_q)$ and $f(\hat{s}_{q'})$, $q\ne q'$, are independent as $N\to\infty$?
