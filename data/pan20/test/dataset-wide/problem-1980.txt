Your question doesn't state whether you present alternatives and get shot down. If you're asking based solely on the fact that you're simply presented with an option you don't like, I'd suggest you either suck it in and do what's best for the team or constructively lay out options in a non-threatening manner. If however you're being forced to implement design choices you don't agree with(for good, cogent reasons!) and your suggestions are being shot down, I'll suggest you provide documented communication (emails, design docs etc) that clearly state your own design . Such docs shouldn't be a comparison but neutrally presented. Make this design available to your lead preferably before he comes up with his, so he's more likely to give yours a fair look while doing his thing. It also has the benefit of making sure your views are on record in case the project goes to pieces due to poor design. A question you should ask is : Does the alternate application design have a desirable outcome? Because at the end of the day, that is what matters: the project. If you're making a stand on a design choice , you need to be sure why you think yours is better or what the other guy's suggestion is doing to hurt the project. It takes strength and maturity to take the high road in a clash of wills. It doesn't make you weak. You need to be able to put the project before opinion. Being the lead, ultimately the responsibility of the failure or success of the project rests on him. 

Personally, I do not think it is unethical at all. Certain types of employment (ie: sales) tend to have clauses written into employees contracts to protect them from actions people do when leaving (poaching customers and colleagues) so as @Vinothbabu mentioned, check that you have no similar items in your employment contract. At the end of the day, your co-worker is an adult and can make up their own mind. They can weigh up the pros and cons of joining your side venture for themselves, you are merely offering the opportunity. Also, this feeds in to a common thread that has started to appear in a few answers on this site recently - think long-term. What is of more benefit to you - developing this side venture or protecting your emplyment/reputation with your current employer? I appreciate it is not always a balck and white decision but you need to think what is best for you and your future. 

This might be a combination of not having anything in common with your acquaintances, hanging in the wrong circle or coming off as not being genuine enough. I meet someone and it seems (s)he's only hanging out with me for superficial reasons or for what he can get out of me, I bob and weave until we fall out of touch. Unless I need something from him too. "Let's be friends first" eh? Genuineness goes a long way with me. Just today I made a professional contact and after the first 15 minutes of conversation, the dude dropped a couple of colourful words and I was sure we'd connected there. I'm not saying you should go all Samuel L. Jackson on your contacts, but try to loosen up a bit, let them see a bit of the real you. 

Has your boss been known to put himself on the line for people or he's doing this just for you? I ask this so you're not unnecessarily guilted into a long term favour-repaying mission. The most solid way to repay confidence and faith placed in you is to vindicate and justify that input with solid output. And you're aware that there is a need for more hands on deck. It's safe to offer your time and effort to your boss (above and beyond the call of normal working hours) seeing as he's done the same in your favour. Try not to think of it as a favour while you're at it, more like justifying his input in your career. At the barest minimum, he'd appreciate the gesture (even if he declines) and know you're not just a taker and you also own a conscience. Should you choose to accept more responsibility however, be sure to not carry too much or more weight that you're sure you can safely handle. All your goodwill reserves will go down the tank if you end up botching your assignments because you've bitten more than you can chew. Few good deeds go unpunished! 

NO! Until you have an offer letter from a new employer in your hand, do not tell your boss/colleagues/company that you are looking for another job If you have a lot of tasks assigned to you when you hand your notice in, you will still have the same amount of notice period, regardless. Part of the responsibility for handing out all these tasks is with your manager to manage handover/cover/failover - what if you were hit by a bus tomorrow? Making you the single point of failure does not always mean it is up to YOU! to manage cover etc 

A lot of prospective employers now have a glance at a candidate's LinkedIn profile. I've written a couple of recommendations for ex-colleagues there in the hope that they will be seen by recruiting companies. It tends to hold more weight than the simple "number of connections" algorithm Most people put the link to their LinkedIn profile on their CV these days too (I do!) 

I'm always pro-team building. Can you put a price on your team's perception of you in the long run? It's hard enough being looked at as an outsider on a team because you're a consultant. Now, putting in the extra effort to distance yourself from an all-too-cheap bonding experience (not to mention the free grub) like a team picnic, to sit at work by yourself seems... I don't know, seems kinda unpleasant. They'll either think of you as money-loving or you don't care about bonding with them. Unless of course if that's not a priority. 

Do not lie about the nature of the opportunity. Advertise the role as is. The job ad was for a senior JEE developer with a strong finance background. Then came the interview and it turned out what they really wanted was to retrain me in the proprietary platform and use me exclusively for that. I looked around for job opportunities with that language and found exactly 6. On 3 major jobs sites. Don't misrepresent the position. I turned down the offer the first time and gave the above reasons. Make sure you have an appealing and versatile platform. One major downside to the platform I was invited on was it's poor support for xml, among other things. I mean what kind of language doesn't let you manipulate xml? Work on your product,make it robust and truly deliver value, don't just concentrate on your effort to lock your clients into your platform (which is pretty much what these guys here have wound up doing). Be very clear that the work environment will be balanced. They'll not be pigeon-holed into the proprietary platform. It was on this basis only that I eventually took the job and my manager has been true to his words. I'm primarily a Java developer and dabble in the proprietary platform 

Personally, I would phone back and ask to speak to the person who interviewed you and make a casual "I just wanted to check that you had my email address correct" or perhaps "I've been having problems with emails not coming through and wanted to check I have not missed one from you" (less preferable) Make it not about chasing but just that you are confirming they have the correct information. If they have genuinely forgotten, it will hopefully prompt them to send the email through with the details. If there is another reason why the email has come through (as per your gut feeling), they will simply confirm the email address is correct. If you then do not receive anything, your gut was correct 

I work in an open plan office where there are 4 people to each bank of desks The lady who sits diagonally behind me will turn round and ‘stare into’ absolutely every conversation that I have with a visitor to my desk be it work related or personal (banter, what was on TV, sports etc). She also does this to the colleague who sits next to me, and especially when the two of us are having conversations. She very very rarely contributes to the conversation, just listens and stares but will occasionally make some unfunny joke to try and shoehorn her way in. NOTE: none of these conversations are in any way private or sensitive, either from a work or personal point of view She is someone who would not take criticism or confrontation very well so how should I deal with this? Everyone seems to know it goes on but no-one really confronts her on it (she has been at this place for many years prior to me joining and I have only been sitting in this position for the past 7 or 8 months) I am finding it more and more distracting. I’ve stopped myself a few times from spinning round and just snapping back with a ‘YES? CAN I HELP YOU?????' Should I speak to management regarding this rather than confront her directly? Moving desks is not an option for me sadly. 

Boring, vanilla, and dispensable in political discourse. Your interview will switch quickly to the meat of your interview: the job 

There are two separate concerns here, it's important to not conflate the two. Address both the way you normally would, individually and impartially. 

Standardization My last position before my current used to run a wild west type methodology. Everybody used the tools they wanted, what they were familiar with. What mattered was getting the projects delivered in good working condition and on time. It made for horrific code maintenance where one project would be developed with GWT as the presentation layer and JUnit solely for all kinds of unit testing and another developer stuck with raw JSPs while yet another brought JSF into the mix. Everyone was shackled to their projects and going on vacation was unthinkable for many and sounded the death knell for code reviews and optimization. I proposed we standardized on a number of industry standard technologies and tools that ensured that we all slept in the same direction of the bed (SoapUI for ws-testing, JSF for the web tier and with moderate success, Spring for back end processing and a couple of other stuff). And we all lived happily ever after. Discourage any individuality when it comes to tools of the trade that will create a files with a proprietary extension (or at least try to mitigate it); I If anyone has a favourite tool they trust their lives with, let them bring it before the court for evaluation and possibly team-wide adoption. You should've taken it upon yourself to set the standards with your tools. The benefits are obvious here, everybody used the same stuff with acceptable levels of comfort so with a decent design doc, anyone can pickup anybody else's bit and move on. Regular and compulsory code/project reviews This is another feature from my last gig. We all met once a week with our manager in a group session and discussed the status of each other's projects and raised concerns and challenges. We all, at a very high level had an idea of what the next guy was working on and sometimes would chip in advice and a couple of lines of code to help out. There was no total isolation Team Spirit I know it seems kind of trite and possibly a no-brainer, but healthy team spirit (and possibly a little competition) fosters information sharing. The downside to cubicle environment (especially team members in cubicles far apart) is that team members are often too far removed from each other's work lives that it's too easy to have a comms breakdown. There's better communication and information sharing when team mates are situated close to each other, preferrably in an open office environment with little in the way of walls or dividers. Discussions and mind-rubbing will happen and flow more freely, with them aim of fostering information sharing. Obviously Document. It's an old song. I won't sing it again 

Start a toilet cleaning rota that has to be signed off when done (similar to pub toilets with the piece of paper on the wall!) and make it part of people's objectives/bring it up in performance reviews if not done. It is the only way to foster any sort of collective responsibility for the state of the toilets as it is obvious everyone appears to think it is someone else problem Failing that, employer a cleaner and inform everyone that there will be no bonuses this year due to the cost of having to employ a cleaner to clean up after everyone! 

I would say that without any proof, you are on pretty shaky ground and it would come down to his word versus yours and it's likely that the more senior employee would be believed either by the MD or your co-workers. Personally (and this is without experience of working for this type of firm/in the broker industry), if it is not noticeably affecting his ability to do his job, then it is of no business of anyones. Unless there are strict clauses in employment contracts about behaviour whilst on the company premises that he is contravening then he is not really doing anything wrong. I'm not sure what would be gained by mentioning this to your co-workers unless you already have an issue with the branch manager for some other reason. 

Depending on your relationship with your boss and your current track record, you should be able to directly approach your boss on the matter 

Outlook also provides a pane just below the email viewing window that displays your entire communication history with the sender of the email being viewed The idea here is that you keep your relationship centered around an integrated communication suite: Meetings, Calendar, Emails, IM should be integrated around the same toolset, so that your dealings with each contact can be surveyed from a single point of access. Again, I would mention the risk of dehumanizing your interactions with these individuals by making it mostly digital and stuffing them into folders and baskets. 

I think such an "infraction" is hardly cause for alarm or worry over the value your manager places on your vacation time. Think of it as taking one for the team. If it happens 2 -3 more times, you might put your foot down (see immediate 3 above before you do this). 

Yes, you definately should. Honesty is always the best policy. Plus, from the way you have described it, you are not re-applying for the same job you were rejected for previously. You were obviously not rejected as being unsuitable for the company as a whole (culture, approach etc) but for a fairly specific role based on a specific lack of experience) If anything, because THEY contacted you, I would mention it. It shows that you have been on thier radar before 

It's not as obvious as some people think so I'll add it here - magnets on the side of PCs/CPUs are a no-no. IT Support staff all have war stories surrounding this! 

It is not your responsibility to tell your boss you are thinking of leaving/they need to hire another person. I'm assuming you have a notice period in your contract and if so, this is there for their benefit as much as yours. As you quite rightly say in your post, this could lead to an awkward relationship/atmosphere which is another reason to look after yourself first. Plus, what if you do broach the subject and then do not find another position for a while? The awkward atmosphere would have to be endured for far longer than you probably anticipated. Keep quiet. Let them do their job and look after yourself!! 

I wouldn't worry about giving correct answers, but how you approach giving an answer at all. I'd hazard a guess that they are aware of the relative impracticality of the question so they're looking out for something else: Approach. On one memorable occasion, I've been in exactly the same situation. While interviewing for a Senior Systems Architect/Integrator position, I was asked a very technical question in a technology I had been very clear was not my strong suit at the start of our session. When the question came, I told them that while I couldn't give them specific pieces of the technology that would be ideal for the problem, I offered alternatives in other technologies that I was comfortable with. I even proffered a likely solution in the tech I was weak in, based on residual memory and how I felt it should likely work. The interviewer proceeded to offer his opinion on approach and we moved on At the end of the session, my interviewer stated he was impressed with my performance, not because I had all the right API calls locked down pat; Because he could see that I was working out in my head, a path to the solution to the problem. He said something along the lines of not giving him crammed or canned answers and how he could observe that I was working on actually solving the problem rather than giving him something regurgitated from a textbook. I got the offer (and turned it down for another). While your current response is fine, you should at the minimum approach the problem with the aim of providing viable alternatives to the absolute correct answer, based on experience, residual memory whatever you have. Make reasonable and educated guesses that shows that you're firing on all cylinders and you're a ferocious problem solver. Not trying at all might not hurt you, but it really wouldn't help either You'll be fine.
