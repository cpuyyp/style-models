Although not greater in number, our hummingbirds this summer seem to be larger than in the past. I think it may be because my husband started making our own nectar, so it's fresher, and might taste better. Some of the feeders are attracting a large number of bees, possibly for the same reason. My question is, does the presence of those bees make the hummingbirds more likely to choose a different feeder, or go to a different yard altogether? In Massachusetts, United States, where I live, there are a very few breeds of hummingbirds. The only one that nests here on a regular basis is the Ruby-throated hummingbird, so I'm willing to bet that's what we have. As for the breed of bees, I have no idea. The picture on the left is an example of bees at one of our feeders. Sometimes they line themselves up completely around the base of the feeder, or even clump up. Others fly around. We don't see hummingbirds eating at the same time. The feeder in the picture on the right is in the same yard about 20 feet away There are no bees, and the bird is happily enjoying the meal.

Unfortunately, it doesn't go on to say what happens if there's another freeze after that time. You do have a Red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), and two varieties of map turtles, the Common Map Turtle (Graptemys geographica), and the Ouachita Map Turtle (Graptemys ouachitensis). So far I'm finding different requirements for the Maps, which may indicate a better chance of success. I need to do some more research, though. 

While there are a number of recognized sub-species of Canada geese, this question pertains to the main species, Branta canadensis. This answer to a question asking how many hours a day Canada Geese sleep, mentioned a sentinel goose. It seems that the function of the sentinel goose is to guard the flock while they're asleep. These geese switch off during the night, so that none are responsible for the whole time. Some animals have a certain gender which is responsible for the safety of the group, and I wonder if this is true with the Canada Goose. The male and female look almost exactly the same, although the male is a bit larger, so unless we see them standing together, it would be very difficult to tell by looking. Is the sentinel (guard) goose always a male, always a female, or does it vary? 

If you want to get a similar feeling at a lower elevation, there is one simple solution: head north (colder) or head west (more snow — shorter growing season). The treeline in Yosemite National Park is at 3,200 – 3,600 metre. The treeline in Jasper National Park is at 2,400 metre. The treeline in the Olympic Mountains is at 1,500 metre. The treeline in the Chugach Mountains in Alaska is at 700 metre or less. Therefore, you can get an impression of higher elevations, without having to worry about the amount of oxygen in the air. As a bonus for granite-lovers: this Svadet near Efjord, Ballangen, Nordland, Norway, and is essentially at sea level: 

Above Vale do Conde, back on the trail, the trail is very wet. Viewing the highest mountain, Torre, in the distance, I could tell that there was a lot more snow yet to come. 

Choose a steady pace that you can keep up non-stop for two hours. If you notice that you need to catch your breath earlier, you are walking too fast. After two hours it's time for a break. The first time I went hiking with a group other than my family, we were fifteen Dutch youths (17–21). There was a steep trail uphill climbing roughly 800 metre, which should take around two hours at low elevation. When we started, almost everybody overtook me within minutes. Within 90 minutes, I had passed all the others one by one, all while they were standing still catching their breath. I was the joint first to arrive at the summit, together with a girl who decided not to speed past me at the start but stay just behind me, then thanked me for keeping a steady pace. 

From your question, it sounds like you already have a plan to supply your body with calories. I'll further assume you will have protein and fat, not just carbohydrates. With those covered, you then need vitamins and minerals. Fiber is a good idea, too. It is possible to be healthy eating only wild animal foods (hunting / trapping) for quite some time, but you have to do it right. Eat the fat and the organs, as they are nutrient rich. (Lions eat only the organs, and leave the muscle to scavengers!) Liver is rich in Vitamin A, which is great but must be balanced with Vitamin D. Very lean meats such as rabbit will leave you nutrient-deficient (if that's all you eat), so you'll still need to fill in the gaps another way. If you learn a few edible wild plants for your area, you can round out your nutritional needs very nicely. I believe that wild plants tend to have much higher mineral and vitamin content than farmed plants. Here in Pacific Northwest, I would focus on: Miner's lettuce, so named because miners would eat it for this very reason. It's very tasty. Stinging Nettle is very nutritious. I eat it raw, but most people will steam or boil it to avoid the stingers. The stems are good for cordage - maybe a bracelet to remember your trip. Dandelion is nutritious and easy to find in many places. I love the yellow flowers, but dislike the stems immensely. Leaves are good, especially when new. Don't confuse it with catsear aka false dandelion. These plants are easy to find & eat, and give you fresh leafy greens that you can't pack with you. To learn more, you can take a wild edibles class and get an edible wild plants book for your region. 

Opinions differ, and for a while, the big hiking destination of Zermatt replaced all the metal signs by wooden signs, for aesthetic reasons, but they have now reverted to metal signs. Personally, I love them, but I may be biased because for me, it was in Switzerland that I learned to love mountain hiking. There are a couple of other, newer categories as well, such as cultural routes and prepared winter hiking routes (not backcountry skiing), but those are far less common. Some more information can be found on the Wandern.ch site in German or in French, including a 64 page guide on trail signs with lots of pictures. 

What you are looking for is a walkie-talkie / two-way radio / private mobile radio with voice control. Normally, to communicate with a walkie-talkie, you need to press a transmit button. Some models, however, have voice-control: they will automatically start transmitting based on voice input. My friend and I used the Midland G7 XTR, that includes this feature. We did not use the voice control, so I don't know how well it works. We were quite worried about battery lifetimes, and wanted to prevent our walkie-talkies from transmitting without need (there are other sounds in nature besides our voice). In principle, though, walkie-talkie with voice control should be exactly what you need. 

Red-white-red markings below the Scatta Minoia, between Alpe Devero and Pomatt, near Domodossola, Italy. It is my impression that in Italy one sees whatever the painters felt like (I've seen white-red, white-red-white, red-white-red, and other variants). 

In May this year (6–8 May) I will have a workshop in Mammoth Lakes, California. I would like to do some hiking in addition to this workshop (roughly one week). I have never been to the United States, but I have considerably experience with trekking in the solitude of the tundra of northern Fennoscandinavia. I'm aiming for a solo wilderness hike with camping in the wild. At the end I should have some way of getting back to the beginning, as I will need to store away luggage somewhere. There appear to be many scenic areas near Mammoth Lakes. From sources such as topoquest, National Forest Locator Map, and wilderness.net I find a number of areas in the vicinity: John Muir Wilderness, Inyo National Forest, Sierra National Forest, Ansel Adams Wilderness, Kings Canyon National Park, Yosemite National Park, Hoover Wilderness, and others. More than enough choice. The main limiting factor: it's only May and I expect that the high mountain passes will be completely blocked by snow. Trails such as the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail appear to reach rather high elevations. Up to what elevation should I normally expect passable terrain in May? Is it feasable to hike in the area I described above, or should I search for a more low-lying region? I will subsequently travel overland to the Mid-West, so it could also be in Nevada, Utah or Colorado. I realise this is a huge area, and I don't have a strong preference to a particular place. I can either hike or well-established trails, on little-known trails, or sections with no trail at all. 

Even if you were in the majority group who were allergic as a child, there is research to back up your experience of being less allergic, or even not allergic at all, now that you're older. From Understanding Poison Ivy Basics: 

The Massachusetts Marine Trades Association Massachusetts Boat Safety Tips website clearly lays out the rules for all varieties of boat. All boaters would benefit greatly from reading that site and its related links. They have a list of potentially life-saving safety tips, two of which may have been especially pertinent in the case of your father's incident. 

We have American mourning doves in abundance in Massachusetts. They spend months in our yard, eating seeds both on the ground and in the feeders. They also peck around in my flower garden, so I think they might be eating grubs and insects. We see many of them every day, rain or shine. I love their plaintive cooing sound. It's hauntingly beautiful. I used to think it was an owl call but know better now. What's interesting is that the call sounds like it's coming from a distance away. It doesn't sound close enough to be at my feeders. I've never seen a bird using their mouth in such a way as to think I was watching them speak. Even when they're in the tree branch above the feeders, as in my second picture, they look and seem silent. I know it's not because they're nocturnal, as I hear it all day, though sometimes louder towards dusk. I don't think I'm just missing it, as I frequently sit outside with them for hours. There's a whooshing sound when they rise from the ground, but that comes from the flapping of their wings, and stops when they land. Do these American mourning doves ever make that lovely cooing sound on the ground, feeder, or anyplace where people can see them? If not, why not? The first picture is of their favorite feeder, which is on a pole about six feet in the air. Frequently at least four share that eating space, with one or two sitting on top waiting for their turn. The second picture is on a branch beside a rope that leads to a feeder a few feet down. The third is on the roof of my sunroom, where they sip water as it runs down in rivulets after a rain. 

The good news is that Wikiloc is very popular in Spain. Pretty much anywhere you'll go you'll find hundreds of GPS-trails. Even if you do not use a GPS-receiver, you can use those in combination with your map to find out where the trails are. It requires good planning and it's helpful to have access to internet while on your trip. To get an impression of what the maps look like, use the free online tool Iberpix visorign. This is a pretty good tool to interactively explore topographic maps of all of Spain, including the islands. I think it's also possible to display trails with the IGN-map as a background, but I will double-check that. 

I have a 5 year old Haglöfs Para M5. I've used it for on average 30 nights per year, perhaps 150 nights in total, with one long trip and some 8 short trips per year. I store it uncompressed in a dry and dark place, and I pack it in its bag inside a drybag (heavily compressed). I don't use a liner. Increasingly, there is no loft and therefore little insulation in the upper part, above the chest. The loft in the lower part, above the legs, is still fine. Is this normal for the level of use I describe? Did all the feathers somehow accumulate in the lower part and can I somehow redistribute them, or do I need to get a new one? 

Suppose I've been out for a long time already, and this system was too far away when I left. And suppose I'm here: 

This year, a Danish citizen went missing without a trace in the mountains of northern Sweden. It is not the first time; in total, ten people are registered as missing after venturing into the mountains of the Swedish county of Norrbotten, including two this year (a Polish citizen in May, and a Danish one in August). This Swedish language article describes the story of several of them. One is the story of two Polish citizens in Sarek National Park, who went missing in the 1990s. One of the less esoteric theories is that they may have disappeared into quicksand. The local Sami inhabitants know about quicksand in the area, as it occasionally kills some of their reindeer. Quicksand might have killed one or more of the missing people — but it is far from certain. Suppose I am hiking by myself in a remote wilderness. How can I minimise the risks of disappearing into quicksand? Can I somehow recognise quicksand in order to avoid it? If I don't recognise it and do get stuck, what can I do to get out? Fortunately, the risk is probably very small, isn't it? 

You always learn how to do things better by doing them. But take baby steps: Start by spending a night in your back yard. See if you can do dinner, sleep, breakfast without going back in the house. Take note of what things you use and what things you don't. There are campgrounds you can drive to. So drive to one & spend the night. If things don't go well, you can always hop in the car & drive home. Find a friend that likes to go camping, and ask to go with them. 

Start with a clean mouth Take a small bite Chew it in the very front of your mouth Spit it out Notice how it tastes, and how you feel. Not just in your mouth & throat, but throughout your body. Dizzy? Fuzzy vision? Weak? 

There are many folk and wild remedies you could learn, depending on what you're carrying & where you're hiking. Some examples: Honey will protect from infection. Spider webs will stop bleeding (for small cuts). Common plantain soothes burns, scrapes, etc. Chew it up to make a salve. 

There are many different plant species, but you can say a lot about entire families, or at least about genera. A great resource for this information is Tom Elpel's Botany in a Day. Learn to recognize the most severe poisonous plans (here in WA state, USA, it's poison hemlock) and don't bother tasting them. It's probably a good idea to skip the whole carrot family. Learn to recognize a few good edibles. I like dandelion, miner's lettuce, chickweed, peppergrass, stinging nettle, and mustards. 

Species in the forest will vary by locale. Here in the Pacific Northwest, Thimbleberry aka Salmonberry leaves are thick and soft, so they make a good wiping implement. The subtly-named How to Shit in the Woods is a good primer on this topic. One option described there is to use urine. Basically, you hold back the urine until you're done with the bowel movement, then use the pee to wash up. To clean your hands afterwards, cedar can help. Take a bite of cedar scales (leaves) straight from a tree. Chew it up & mix with saliva. Spit it out on to your hands and rub all over.
