I wrote a long passage about why I consider this bold skepticism to be justifiable, but on second thought, let's put that aside to look at the sex claim. Suffice to say we can guess that many texts have been lost but it's hard to confirm that in reality. In the Kulacūdāmaṇi Tantra, one of the 64 catalogued, we find the following: 

The article also finds that Ramadan fasting is bad for diabetics (who are not encouraged to fast in Islam), or if people rush to eat fatty or greasy foods at the end of the day. But this literature review is from a fairly minor journal in an Islamic country, written by Muslim scientists. The "detoxification" citation makes the review particularly suspicious as it cites a completely pseudoscientific self-published book. I don't think this review applied scientific levels of skepticism, even if the other studies it cites look more respectable. Here's a more technical, careful literature review from an Islamic country: "The effect of Ramadan fasting on cardiometabolic risk factors and anthropometrics parameters: A systematic review" Pak J Med Sci. 2015 Sep-Oct; 31(5): 1250–1255.

It appears that through some kind of slow osmosis this turned into a myth about the "plant of immortality" in New Age pamphlets sometime around the 1970s or 1980s. The ancient Egyptians had no special interest in aloe, as we learn from the popular book Aloe - Myth, Magic, Medicine: Aloe Vera Across Time (Universal Graphics, 1989): 

In Freud's letters, he expressed a belief that random numbers were telling him messages about his life. When he was assigned a phone number ending in 62, he wrote to his friend Carl Jung that 

Most of this simply summarizes knowledge which can be acquired by looking at miscarriages. The information which is not mere observation, such as the "seven bodily fluids," is inaccurate. Other parts of the quotations are also inaccurate. 

The context of this claim: how did the New England colonists view the land they were settling? The Eastern seaboard of America had four major strains of colonists: Quakers and Cavaliers, who emphasized living in harmony with the native Americans, Scots-Irish in the South, who did not care much about natives at all, and the famous Puritans/Separatists, whose entire worldview was very strongly religious. Of these groups, the comparison of Indians to Canaanites/Amalekites which is being claimed here would be coming solely from the Puritans. The Puritans were indeed making a metaphor between their journey from England to New England, and the journey of the Israelites out of Egypt and into Palestine. However, they were entirely aware that this was only a metaphor. There have been some Protestants who literally believed that the Old Testament's message applied to them (notably the Boers of South Africa), but the Puritans were very much aware that they were living in the present day. We can find proof of this in the Cavalier Thomas Morton’s book The New English Canaan (1637). Morton was imprisoned and banished by the Puritans, and referred to himself as a Canaanite. He described the natural bounty of New England as far closer to the appearance of temperate Canaan than the desert of Israel, and proposed that natives and colonists ought to reject the self-appointed "chosen tribe" (Puritans) and their "New Israel" (Plymouth) and live together in a multicultural New Canaan, which is the origin of the present-day city of New Canaan, Connecticut. Morton was not renouncing Christianity or Englishness by taking up the Canaanite cause. Nowhere in his book do we see a hint that "Israel" might want to go to war with him. Rather, he was using the Puritans' metaphor against them, in a way that he was probably expecting to hit home and get on their nerves. With that background, we can now answer the question. Cotton Mather is one of the most famous Puritan preachers. He lived during King Philip's War, which was a legitimate all out war between Englishmen and Native allies against other Indians. During the war he gave sermons encouraging Puritan forces to take up arms, though it might be against their first instinct, for the sake of the community. From "a discourse delivered unto some part of the forces engaged in the just war of New-England against the northern & eastern Indians": 

The collection of documents also shows evidence of a far better-known strategy by Exxon: the public attack on climate science and FUD campaigns that began in 1999. This has included objections to scientific opinion and funding of what is properly called climate denialism. But I see no evidence that Exxon was trying to suppress climate change information when the field was first starting out in the 1980s, unless if there was a vast conspiracy involving fake internal documents. On the contrary, their initial intent, in that distant age when large corporations were being treated harshly by regulators, was to use company data to look like responsible leaders in scientific control of climate pollution. In fact, the LA Times team does not claim that there was a conspiracy to suppress results, but merely discusses these two different periods in modern history: the cooperation with the scientific community circa 1980, and the bald-faced rejection of its consensus circa 2000. Bill McKibben's article unnecessarily conflates these two periods to create the illusion of a conspiracy. 

The citation is mistaken, but who is correct, Wikipedia or the State Department? Let's look at an article entitled "Moroccan Sultan Sidi Muhammad Ibn Abdallah's Diplomatic Initiatives toward the United States, 1777-1786" (Proc. Am. Phil. Soc. 143(2) (1999), 233-265) 

I can see why this question is not answered yet, because a prospective answerer must first determine: how many tantras actually exist? And surprisingly, this is not easily answerable: try to find a reference to the "about 200" figure offered in the question, or any figure at all, and you soon run into marginally scholarly publications by people citing numbers they heard from their guru. T. Goudriaan states in "Hindu Tantric Literature in Sanskrit" (in his Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature, Harrassowitz 1981): 

I assume this study was done with an early prototype, as the follow-up has better results: Happy Fish: A Novel Supplementation Technique to Prevent Iron Deficiency Anemia in Women in Rural Cambodia (PhD thesis) 

From the LA Times article, some examples of open discussion with the scientific community circa 1990: 

This story is surprisingly easy to completely disprove, because devotion to Aristotle's worldview was banned at the University of Paris in thirteenth century. Condemnations of 1210–1277 

According to, Matthew Levitt, Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad (Yale University Press), the organization responsible for this false quotation, the Islamic Association of Palestine, was a well-known source of Hamas propaganda. On the urging of the questioner, I have filed a request with the BBC about their October 2001 news stories. (update: It appears that radio news is not archived by the BBC itself. The British Library may have it, but the person responding to my query seemed to answer in the negative.) 

(There is no Valerie Bowman on this page anyway, because she didn't graduate until 1978.) It does have a few short comments that seem to deal with everyday life on campus. 

Review of Iron Supplementation and Fortification (journal of questionable quality; possible conflict of interest from one author) 

In other words, 1.5% background is an abnormally low result. A PubMed comment on the original study also points out that it misinterprets the mechanism that was being examined by one of its sources. 

Basically, Iraqis are dead certain that this video shows purposeful aid to ISIS, and America says that's impossible, although their air drops have been received by ISIS in the past. I was unable to find any American explanation of who this particular air drop was allegedly intended for, even though the Washington Post surely asked and the National Review could have pulled strings as well. 

The general situation in Ukraine In 2012, the European Union warned Ukraine against associating with the Svoboda party, accusing it of “racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views.” In 2013, just prior to the revolution, John McCain was photographed at the Ukraine Maidan standing next to a member of Svoboda who had called for a fight against the "Muscovite-Jewish mafia". In post-2014 Ukraine, Neo-Nazism is common both at the municipal level and at the state level. This is actively supported both by United States politicians and at the highest levels of the State Department: 

As the questioner has observed, the 1907 Imperial Conference was primarily about Britain's official colonial holdings and the question of Zionism and Arab nationalism never arose. Before this translated essay was published in 2007, I could only find one source that connects Campbell-Bannerman directly with the Middle East: a 1985 U. Texas-Austin dissertation, "Iran and the Big Powers 1900-1953", where Campbell-Bannerman is blamed for being disinterested in the Middle East: 

I have nothing to add in response to Fizz's comment. I did not intend to make this answer about the politics of climate change. I simply desired to point that the Wegman report and the National Academy of Sciences agree that MM05 provided accurate technical criticisms of Mann's model, so McKitrick's summary of the Wegman and NAS panels is entirely accurate. 

On one hand, slogans of the Arab Spring included chants about access to bread, and there is a strong correlation between the FAO Food Price Index and two waves of protests. The dotted blue line here shows the date of a warning from the authors of the cited paper that protests would occur: (source) 

First of all, there is no record of this event in Japanese, so I have to write this post from the frustrating perspective of proving a negative. But basically, this retelling is completely silly. The samurai part is historically impossible, because samurai were abolished with the declaration of the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The Russo-Japanese war was not a place where people would put on old costumes and go dueling. There was no incident in the Russo-Japanese War where the armies simply stood and watched two of their warriors fight. At Port Arthur, the batteries were constantly firing down on the Japanese. There was no time to pause and wait. The katana part is not possible either. Officers in the pre-fascist era Imperial Japanese Army were issued cheap ceremonial swords of European style, not samurai swords. Some also had sabres, but these would have been more clearly identifiable. The Togo part is ridiculous. Tōgō Heihachirō became well known throughout the West because he led the small Japanese Navy to a shocking victory against Russia's Czarist Fleet. But he had nothing to do with Port Arthur, and it would have been highly improper for him to congratulate someone who defeated a Japanese officer in another wing of the armed forces. Such an event would have created a scandal in Japan. Basically, I cannot answer whether or not there was a sword duel or a scuffle, but the "samurai duel" version is definitely false.
