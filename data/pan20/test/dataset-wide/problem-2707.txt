All claimants have a burden of proof. If I were to make claim that the earth is round I would have a burden to provide proof at least if asked. In physics we spent several weeks confirming the laws of motion experimentally. When we are taught about the laws of motion it is backed up with centuries of experimental data and confirmation. The only claims that do not necessarily require a burden of proof are claims of opinion, "BBQ sauce tastes better on burgers than A1." While arguementitive it is clearly a statement of opinion even though it is not worded as such. However a statement of "Many people prefer the taste of BBQ sauce to A1 on their burgers" may fall in a grey area. It is a statement of opinion but it has a indefinate amount of quantification. Any demand of proof is expected to have a reasonable allowance. It is concievable that there are people who prefer condiment sauce to another. However if the statement were more specific with words like Most, or a specific percentage then there would be a burden of proof to show a study or studies that agree with the statement. As for religion. There is a burden of proof here. The priest says I can not prove god. I can educate you to his teachings, I can provide counsel to you in your times of need. I offer you a promise of eternal life for believing. So while there is a burden of proof on the theologian you can choose not to require it. Or you can choose not to accept it. This is the case with all claims. You can accept "Global Warming" but that does not absolve the claimants burden of proof to anyone else other than you. 

I think this depends on how you define existance. Even if you are nothing more and a creation of my mind then you exist even if it is just as that creation in my mind so long as I continue to think of you and/or have a memory of you. Existance as we know it can only be defined through the interpretations of feedback of our nerves by the synapes and neuron in our brain. I only know this because scientists have determined this however it is possible that my mind created this knowledge. It is also possible that we (or at least I) exist as something that has my thoughts and interpretations but is not designed or allowed to comprehend actual existance (Think living in the Matrix. They exist as their bodies in the matrix but also have actual bodies outside the matrix.) I can concieve of no way to disprove an actual existance that does not result in the destruction of the percieved existance. 

Ayn Rand wrote political rhetoric not philosophy. It is intended to provoke emotion not thought and targets the weakest points of her opponents and ignores the failings of its own. Her work of philosophy was built upon her fictional world and appeals to emotion. Her attempted foray into philosophical work(Essays written to various publications) was really prompted by her cult like following, that developed subsequent to the publication of Anthem, Fountainhead, and Atlas Shrugged. But even this work was designed consumption not analysis. It is full of Appeals of Emotion , Fear, and Ad Hominem Tu Quoque. These are effective tools for political muck raking but not the types of arguments that sway critical thinkers. I would expect that these issues would be overlooked and someone would take the ball and run with it developing Objectivism into a valid philosophy. Save for the fact that Ayn Rand had a penchant for attacking anyone who did not agree with her labeling them Communists and criminals, especially attacking those in the liberal arts academia. So combining her vitriol for academia with a pseudo-philosophy that essentially labels academia as worthless, and it is anti-intuitive for those academics to validate her works. And those few who have risked the ire of the academic community as well as turning out works that no longer invoke the emotion that drew those who would follow in first place. 

There is no good reason to surrender your liberties. But worse is when you surrender mine. The US was founded on the rights and liberties being sacrosanct. Just because it is easier to do with the liberties surrendered does not mean it is the right way to do it. I would propose that if it can not be done with out the suspension of civil liberties and freedoms then it should not be done in the first place. 

Propaganda is a useful form of warfare. Critizing you enemy to your people can either make them fear the less (As the US did with the Japanese during WWII) or make them fear them more to get behind the fight against them(As with the "War on Terror"). It can make your enemies people less willing to back the fight. And it can break the will of the soldier on the front line. While in an arguement Ad Hominim attacks are generally a sign of a weak position, in warfare they can be effective. In war, as in politics, it is often more important to appear to be correct than to actually be correct. 

Yes. As far as I am concerned this was the most egregious violation of basic human rights, and to the rights of the states to be soveriegn entities as well. 

Miracles are by definition beyond rationality. The rational mind knows that everything can be explained. So a miracle, defined as something happening for reasons, and through a process can not be explained, is beyond rationality. So any acceptance of a miracle is really just the surrender to the inability to find any scientific process that can explain it. However if you define miracles as an act of god who is the creator, then everything is a miracle. How can something have come from nothing? How does life begin, the grow, then develop the ability to think? All of this is miraculus even though we can explain the process scientifically the fact that it actually happened unstead of just theoretically is miraculous. Just because we understand the process that got us here does not take away from the that. 

Mathmatics is a set of definitions. Many things in the world can be represented mathmatically but that does not mean that the formala that represents the object is the object. Mathmatics can be used to describe all of those things that have a measureable quality. However it requires our understanding to be meaningful. E=mc2 is only meaningful if you understand how to apply it. So it is possible that to define equations that define how things that we can not currently measure work. But until we understand those measurements those equations are meaningless. So while it may be possible to describe through a set of equations all of the physical characteristics of an object they are meaningless without understanding. However I do have an answer for you and it is 42. 

I can imagine a scenario where a single all powerful god create the universe that we know of. That god does not seek to be venerated, nor that we follow any moral principles he has set out. The universe was created and designed intelligently. This was prior to any religion being created. In addition I can concieve of a scenerio where the god does seek to be venerated but his creations choose to use that veneration as a means to manipulate and gain wealth and power themselves. In both of these scenerios Intelligent design happens but religion is not necessitated. 

There were other options. Slavery was near its end because of the industrial revolution. It was a flash point political issue of the time. There was never any intention to treat the slaves as actual people. In fact the union was very much against that in the first place. Lincoln was essentially beatified in US Culture after his death because of the need of the symbol. Our christan roots elevated martyrdom despite any shortcomings or actual achievements. It is indeed possible that the victory of the Union held back both persons of color and women from full acceptance as persons of equal value to while males. The liberated slaves no longer had work or anyone to provide for their families. Many were allowed to starve to death after all they were not human beings what did it matter? The labor that the slaves provided was replaced by machines. Most of them run by white men. A person can choose to break the rules knowing that there will be consequenses. It is never ok for a government to break the rules on those they govern's behalf. There are methods to change the rules. There are instances of specific exceptions (See the 14th amendment) to rules that exist. To me any blatent violation of the constitution, reguardless of the reason, is Treason pure and simple. I dont care if it is authorizing the abduction and torture of terror suspects, or using power to coverup and facilitate violations of the constitution. Governments that are created to be bound by rules set in place, have a covenent with the people to operate under prescribed conditions. When the governement or a member of the government acting as an agent of the government they are breaking that covnent with the people. This is at its worst treason. The governement has the power to destroy and cause the deaths of millions of not just its own citizens. This power is granted with the limitations imposed. The usurping of power not granted and especially that which is expressly forbidden to it, is a form of the highest crime against those it governs. It risks the very legitimacy of the nation and its government when it does so. 

You have a closed machine that is itself a white ball that works without inputs that every 5 seconds produces a ball. It has produced 1 million balls in its lifetime. Every one of those 1 million balls has been white. And each of these balls produces balls and all of them have been white. Is it possible that the next ball it creates will be black? We know why all of the child balls create only white balls and that they can only create white balls. Does this change the yes or no possibility of the parent machine's ability to produce a black ball? We can not actually answer that question. But is it reasonable to expect that when those things that it spawns produce in a way that seems consistent to the way that it produces that it is more likely that it is not possible for the parent to produce a black ball than that it is. In the universe everything we know has a cause. Certain things are consistent throughout the universe. One of them is that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The very essence of everything, matter, has anti matter that cancels it out. So is it reasonable to believe that though everything else has a cause that there is a finite solution that has no cause. And that the finite solution that has no cause is the Universe of Existence? It may be possible to get outside of the universe of existence. But then if we are outside of it the definition of something would fall apart as something is included in existence. So within the subset that is existence as inferred by the wording of the question, it is not reasonable to expect that the Universe of Existence has no cause. So while I cannot know for certain that there is a cause, until such time as something else is demonstrated to also not have a cause, I can see no valid argument for the belief that the universe is a unique outlier despite a 100% inclusion of its parts. And my point is that just because we can not rule it out does not mean that it is actually possible. Take a variable X. X is set to 1. It is never changed. X has the potential to be 0 but it has been set to 1 and never changed so it is not possible for it to be 0 unless it is changed. So while everything has the potential to be uncaused nothing actually is. So if nothing is uncaused then it is not possible for something to be uncaused. Our inability to prove this does not change the actuality. 

Post WWII there was a deliberate effort led by the US to remove national pride from the citizens of European Countries. It was taught in school that the was bad because of what either they did in the case of Germany, Austria and Italy, or had done to them or allowed to do to others. The theory being that doing this would help prevent the leaders like Hitler from creating an empire by conquering their neighbors. Today this is manifest in the EU expecting everyone to believe the same way they do and fits well into the Socialist agenda. Seeing as we all pay taxes to our country and most of us are able to participate in our countries government process I do not see any reason that being proud of your country would be unethical. In the case of the United States many of us have ancestors that fought in its wars and even were a part of settling North America. Certianly there are things in all countries past that we wish we could do over to correct. But with out those experiences to guide us forward we would be doomed to make those mistakes eventually. I think it is ok to be a proud German, that does not mean that you are proud of the actions of Naxi Germany in the 1930's and 40's. 

Because the Right mouse button is on the right and the left mouse button is on the left... To me Right and Left are learned. When I was young when i needed to distinguish right from left I remember picturing an Atari Console which had right and left players marked clearly. It is more rote now than it used to be but it still does not always feel natural. I sometimes get momentarily confused if someone gives me a direction like turn right if I am expecting to turn left. Other times I do not distingish the difference and turn left instead. If I have no expectation there are still times where I need to think about which direction that is. I actually know rmb and lmb not because of right and left but because it is in my muscle memory. I know left and right mouse buttons not because of the right and left directions but because that is how i have thought about them for nearly 20 years. So basically left and right are nothing more than common labels. Much like drivers and passenger side. But I like to think of it as you are either right or wrong handed. And to be nice instead of saying wrong handed we said left... so going forward just replace left with wrong and it will be much easier. 

Capitolism is more an economic policy. Socialism more of a is a govenment policy. The 2 can coexist. Socialism has the govenment providing basic neccessities to everyone (Food, health, medicine, etc). Capitolism can provide beyond these necessities or as an alternitive to the government provided services. Marxism is a form of socialism that gives the state ownership of everything. Capitolism is not compatible with marxism. Communism is an economic policy where everything is shared equally. Communism is not socialism. Communism provides shared bounty and famine alike. Marxism and Socialism are not compatible with Communism despite claims by both sides to the contrary. Both Marxism and Socialism have a strong central government providind and deciding what to provide. Communism is more compatible with democracy than Socialism or Marxism. I believe the debate between Marx and Smith would likely center around Marx's belief that government must provide for the needs of man and society and Smith's belief that man will provide for itself and society with out the intervention of government or other factors. Smith believed that it was in the interest of businesses that produce to keep their customers and workers healthy and productive. Smith would likely argue that marxism takes away the incentive of business to care for their customer and workers thus causing them harm.
