so let's continue. Q: Are apples healthier than other fruit? A: It is impossible to make a blanket statement, but in some respects, yes. Some features of the apples are special. No doubt, advocates of the other fruits could make alternative (and correct) health claims about their fruits as well. For example: 

According to Wikipedia, the TRS-80 Model 100 sold 6 million units. This number seems very high. In fact, our former Dear Leader, Jeff Atwood wrote: 

Given the lack of evidence, so far, it seems that trained dogs are not to be trusted. This provisional position might change if people can find other cues that trigger the dogs, or other ways of training dogs. Given that blood glucose meters, while arguably not as cute as a dog, are fairly cheap and fairly accurate, it seems dog trainers will have a large hurdle to train dogs to be sufficiently sensitive and specific to warrant their use. 

Conclusion: Ellis Silver has published a vanity book in which he makes some out-of-this-world claims, which are not supported by evidence. Certainly not enough evidence to discard our existing well-established understanding of human evolution. 

It suggests that men (nor women) do not, as the question's quotes suggests, treat "immodestly dressed"1 women (or men) as merely "as a collection of parts", while supporting the view that men (and women) may treat immodestly dressed women (and men) differently. Limitations This doesn't completely address the question. I couldn't see anything in the paper that suggested women and men reacted differently (except where there was symmetrical differences between the perceptions of photos of the same and opposite genders), but I also couldn't see that they were looking for such a pattern. So, there's no evidence here of being "wired" differently, but I don't see how that could be proven in any case. The subjects were not asked to overcome these feelings, so it is impossible to say whether it would be "easy" for them to compensate for them. 

Accidents. I'm making an assumption that a laptop in use is at higher risk of being dropped, liquid damage, etc. Fans, dust and other cooling problems: Increased use causes more dust be drawn into the system which causes heat related failures in many different componants. Fans also have a limited lifespan, affected by usage and further affected by heat. SSD lifespan is limited by write-cycles. Many modern SSDs will outlast their host computer, but none the less, the lifespan is affected by usage. 

Evelyne Ameye, 'Channelling of Nuclear Third Party Liability towards the Operator: Is it Sustainable in a Developing Nuclear World or is there a Need for Liability of Nuclear Architects and Engineers?' (2010) 19 European Energy and Environmental Law Review, Issue 1, pp. 33â€“58 TL;DR Japanese citizens are not liable for accidents abroad under international law. No evidence of assumed responsibility.

'Cloud Seeding' Not Effective at Producing Rain as Once Thought, New Research Shows It's a hard problem to decide though - effectively "hypothetical meteorology" i.e. you must decide when, where and how much would it have rained anyway, had you not done anything. Other peer-reviewed studies have come to a different conclusion: 

Mechanical failure causing end of use (Note: Almost anything is technically fixable, but to calculate the lifespan we are looking at events which result in the laptop not repaired, whether for economic reasons, unavailability of parts, user not being aware of repair options or anything else): 

This list continues much further, I just got bored of transcribing. You might like to take a look at it to look up the closest type of potatoes to the ones you consume, and how you prepare them. They also have far more detail (including some of the missing error ranges, when the original test was done with the bread scale), references to the original studies, sample sizes, etc. Where several studies are comparable, they also provide grouped averages. In conclusion, it is unreasonable to expect that a wide-range of naturally grown potatoes, from many different countries, and measured by the effect on human volunteers, to have a single, precise value for their GI index. 

This YouTube video titled Snowboarder Girl Chased By Bear - I Was Singing Rihanna Work And Didn't Know It Was Behind Me! depicts a woman snowboarding in Japan. Occasionally, a running bear comes into shot in the background. The description says: 

Source: NPR Having seen Jivlain's answer, posted while I wrote this, I am not so sure Atem is correct here. 

But this figure is misleading, because the number of times that the men viewed the pornography during that 1, 3 or 6 month period is much higher than then women. From the same table compare the number of respondents who had viewed pornography in the past 24 hours: 

He goes on to describe the recent viral spread of this image. While Kent Smith is apparently not an expert in oceanography, he proffers a plausible explanation, and doesn't claim that the two kinds of sea-water will never mix. The question asks "is it common or can it be counted a miracle?" This is a false dilemma. Phenomena can be both uncommon and have natural, rather than supernatural, explanations. 

I would say almost certainly not. I can't see any evidence the Japanese government has passed any law or made any promises to assume liability, and they are not liable under international law - the main law that governs this is the amended IAEA Vienna Convention which most but not all countries using nuclear power are signatories to. Certainly it would appear to be a pretty stupid move to assume responsibility here, and with no source for the claim it doesn't seem credible. 

Cocaine use and many other things also stimulate the reward area of the brain. This article in the Journal of Advanced Practive Nursing says that love, cocaine and gambling are all similar: 

The lifespan, using this definition, can be affected by usage. Break this down by the reasons why the laptop ceases being used: 

Software faults causing end of use (Note: Software faults can always be resolved by a competent person, but in the real world laptops do get replaced for this reason, thus affecting the lifespan): 

Der Spiegel has a formidable reputation for investigative journalism and operates what the Columbia Journalism Review called "most likely the world's largest fact checking operation". The report by Der Spiegel was partly compiled by Laura Poitras, who collaborated with Edward Snowden and the Guardian on initial release of information from internal NSA documents. Both the Guardian and the Washington Post (who have copies of the leaked documents) have confirmed the report by Der Spiegel (Guardian, Washington Post). Based on all the above, yes, this is a credible claim from reliable sources. 

TL;DR Geller's skills could be performed by a competent magician. There is no good evidence that he uses paranormal means, and evidence that at least some of the time he cheats, so the simplest explanation is that he is a competent magician. 

"Of these, an astonishing one in 20 has been charged" would suggest at least 150 currently living priests have been charged. The Catholic Church acknowledges 29 living priests (and an additional 30 dead) as "guilty". 

Of these, at least 45% were being exploited in the sex industry (likely a lot higher, given the significant "unknown" figure): 

I don't have much to say here, because Cancer Research UK have already written a winning answer. (Sometimes the giants are tall enough that there's no need to stand on their shoulders.) If you visit Tobacco, smoking and cancer: the evidence you will find explanations of all these facts: 

In conclusion, the experimenters have come up with an interesting idea and produced a exploratory proof-of-concept paper. However, this will need to be reproduced before it can be accepted. It will require a lot of new development and sophistication before it can be considered a serious threat and/or technology. 

(His reference to Brown is to: Brown WS, Jacobs HR, Thompson RE. Thermal fatigue in teeth. J Dent Res 1972;51:461-7. I haven't read this.) I note Ingles is referring the cracking through thermal cycling, whereas others have reported "microcracks" and "pitting" due to the hardness of the ice. These effects seem unrelated. Conclusion There are some reputable people and organisations making the claim. However, having looked at many of the claims on the web, I can see few providing links to scientific evidence of it occurring in practice. The limited scientific evidence I was able to find did not suggest that there was a link. Absence of evidence proves little in this case; a more thorough literature search may provide the smoking gun. In my opinion, for what little that is worth, it is probably true. I'm going to start avoiding chewing on ice in the meantime. 

Viruses, malware, etc. A laptop can only be practically attacked while turned on, so the chance of malware is drastically increased by usage. User initiated software problems i.e. the user deleted something vital or caused a performance problem by installing software. I would guess this is the more frequent cause of replacement of 3-5 year old laptops. 

** EDITED to reflect edits to the question and discussion in comments. ** Everything in the article seems credible, and doesn't seem to contradict other sources. It does seem guilty of sensationalising the subject because there doesn't seem to be any unique link here - you can could equally draw similarities with love, food, sex, sports or many other things. Certainly we can say there are some similarities between facebook feedback and cocaine use which are backed up by scientific studies, such as this study published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience in which researchers used Functional MRI scans to establish that positive feedback on Facebook does stimulate the reward centre in the brain. 

There are plenty of online sources to confirm this list is accurate. I spot checked a few (Andrew Jarzyk, Li Junjie,Gabriel Magee, Ryan Henry Crane) and others have links to sources. As to whether this is unusual, suicidal bankers are not unusual: 

In summary: No, a reliable technology does not exist. It's still unclear, despite several scientific studies, how effective the technology is. It might still useful, at least in some situations, but we can say for sure it's not yet "a reliable technology". 

Note: I'm not including theft here. I think risk of theft might increase with use, but a stolen laptop is likely to remain in use, just with a different user mmary: TL;DR Yes, the lifespan of laptop does depend significantly on its usage. 

Does playing electronic games release enough dopamine to interfere with how well a child feels and functions at other times? 

Source. So, the claim that Sodium Fluoride was only used as rat poison prior to 1938 is false. Prior Art in Science The 1952 book A Survey of the Literature of Dental Caries by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council shows that there was a lot of literature already existing by the beginning of the 1950s. 

In short, there is no reason to believe birds' nests treat any illnesses and the proponents aren't even clear which species of birds should be used for their nests. Chinese Traditional Medicine is a pseudo-science. 

From the third column from the right, it can be seen 12 witnesses (in 16 interviews) said that Michael Brown put his hands up when fired upon, two said he didn't, and many didn't know or were not asked. Note: Taking a simple majority of eyewitnesses statements isn't a safe method of determining the truth. 

(I suspect, from context, that "liberty steak" referred to a hamburger patty, and a "liberty sandwich" referred to a hamburger - a patty in a bun - but I haven't got a reference for that.) 

In Australia, teachers (like many workers in unionised occupations) are paid in accordance to an "industrial award". The awards are determined by state. To support that with an example, the Queensland government says:
