It's a common criticism of Spencer's social Darwinism that it misunderstands the entire theory of evolution and the meaning of "fitness" such that it is commonly exploited to fulfill specific hateful political agendas. However, what exactly is wrong with the notion that the most competent individuals in society thrive? Consider an academic setting with a particularly rigorous professor running a particularly rigorous course. Obviously, only the most studious and tenacious students will be able to pass while the lazier ones will either fail or drop the class, and rightly so; only those who earn their keep should be rewarded. How is this idea immoral? Perhaps I am misunderstanding social Darwinism. 

Recently, I've realized that I've grown so enamored with the typical famous thinkers (Kant, Berkeley, Quine, Mill; the usual crew) that I forgot academic philosophy still exists. Unfortunately, I hardly know of any credible or quality sites to get quality contemporary news, articles, or papers on philosophy. Could any of you provide me with some suggestions? 

Got a short quest if creation gives rise to time and the world. Our perception allows observation of that world and we interpret events within it as a result of which we describe as causality. Action and reaction cause and effect. This observation leads to a contradiction since any creation requires action which creation is the effect of that action. Without time you cannot have causality because causality is a sequence of cause and effect and requires time to afford sequence. So the world could not be a result of creation since creation is the reaction or effect of a cause that requires the presence of time. So do we conclude time is eternal to allow the causal nature any creation requires and confirm the correctness in our perception of causality from observation. 

Assumption is a perception of inconclusiveness and cannot be used to obtain the fact of anything, which conclusion should lead to from a rational argument. Any interpretation should not come from a basis of assumption if you conclude that rational argument is a process that returns fact. Science adopts a method of argument from a conception or theory and a test of that through experiment and the data returned from that test which is statistically analysed empirically to affirm or reject the theory based upon a probability of certainty that cannot ever return an absolute. It is certainly an assumption that this method returns any truth based on its application which logically opposes its own nature from its uncertainty and its attempt at truth. Which leads to an interpretation of anything but faith with an absence of any other method. 

I think a possible solution might not lie in the truth or our knowledge of the truth of theory-laden theories or hypotheses as much as in their usefulness. Even if everything might be theory-laden, we still get magnificent results from the application of science. Although we can't claim with certainty to have knowledge or knowledge of the truth of phenomena, we can still make predictions and inventions for the sake of their products. In this light, then, we might be able to refute the anti-vaxxer or climate change denier by comparing his predictions and according results with a credible scientist's predictions and according results; the conceptual scheme that made more accurate predictions than the other would then qualify as "better" (albeit not "true"). Then, depending on how inaccurate the results turned out, we should reject the science-denier's theory/hypotheses on the grounds that it would simply be not worth our time. Alternatively, if the anti-science advocate's policies were enacted and harm arose from it, e.g. more and more children would begin to die of polio, then we could use these adverse effects as justification to reject their theory. To put it more simply, we should only accept the scientific community's conclusions on climate change or vaccines if they are more useful to believe. I'm more confident with this solution in the context of the natural sciences, but I would think it would still be applicable in social and political issues as well. Intuitively, I would respond that the relativism of social and political issues could be avoided if we only accepted falsifiable hypotheses, but that solution is obviously off the table. I'm no scholar, and I'm not sure if Quine or Kuhn or any of those you mentioned would even espouse this view, but I still think it is relevant and doesn't clash with theory-laddenness assumptions. 

I haven't read any of the answers but what if the objective we are subject to is an projection from the subjective and it's distinction has no quantitative or qualitative value and cannot be determined to be the truth the result therefore negates my statement and leaves an indetermiation in it and the logic I know firmly that I experience my own thoughts but the truth is even that is subject to it and recursive in manner for all I know my thoughts may be subject to control by laplaces demon and are not singularly my own and my consiouness and experience is a product of that demon. I've just grown to ignore the possibility and carry on with my life lol 

Time allows us to experience events, events from the transient present become fact to those that observe them and reference them from memory. But only with a faith in the recollection because we are unable to determine any truth with the process of there allocation from our perception and its interpretation of the observation of those events. An argument for determination of any truth is able to be counter argued and leave you with no method of determining any truth if the argument for action and reaction holds. This argument if it has no counter argument, as the only truth leads to a necessity of having to have faith in everything you appear to observe or recollect as being the truth without the assurance of proof. Or maybe action and reaction is not a valid argument which frees us and enable us to determine truth through argument and not need faith which the argument 'causes'. 

I'm currently writing a paper for a class that's supposed to "weave" together the philosophical system presented in Plato's Allegory and dialogues. When I spoke with my professor on the assignment, he said that Plato's own philosophical opinions were unwritten and cannot necessarily be gleaned from his own writings, and thus I ought not to refer to the system found in Plato's texts as "Plato's philosophy." Is this true? Are we wrong to attribute things like the Theory of Forms and the proto-social contract theory as described in Meno to Plato? 

In the United States, Donald Trump's election has been all the rage, and his Tweets and public declarations have received much attention, especially those that accuse CNN and the "liberal media" in general for being "fake news." Prima facie, this is an attempt to refuse facts for the sake of an agenda. However, these people who cry "fake news" may be on to something; while it might seem to be easy to justify the epistemological validity of news coverage, the problem ultimately boils down to the justification of hearsay: "I asked the man in the airport where the bathroom was, and I trusted him" is of a similar form as "I saw on The Washington Post that Scaramucci made some vulgar comments about Steve Bannon, and I believed it." Here's my main question: What is the epistemic justification for knowledge by news/hearsay? Is there a specific epistemological problem for this, and if so, what is it called? 

Can't we simply use common sense in the statements negation the statements truth could only come from observation but it is an assumption. It contains a nature in its content which is contradictory ie eating when not hungry question the nature of the truth of the observation. The negation "Jakie does not eat sweets if she is hungry" is the common sense negation and results in a similar contradiction in the meaning of the content and maintains the possible truth or assumption in the observation. The logic applied is not an analysis in the nature of the determination of the contradiction in the statement and the negation, or the truth of the observation the statement comes from, but in the negation of the structure and syntax of the language the statement is a composition of. 

Uncertainty means no determinable pattern and would mean the there is no pattern to events overall in the absolute of eternity an intractable problem. Certainty a determinable one with absolute pattern but still subject to the question of eternity an intractable one. I guess we will never be certain either way! 

From what I've gathered, reliabilism states that epistemic justification occurs when someone forms a belief via truth-conducive methods. However, doesn't this fall to the problem of induction? Isn't reliabilism assuming that truth-conducive methods, or methods that have produced true beliefs in the past, will persist to be truth-conducive? 

I can't think of a specific term, but the closest one that I remember is called the fallacy fallacy: dismissing an opponent's conclusion as false/unworthy of consideration merely because fallacies were present in their argument. 

It seems to me that the rejection of the validity of induction would cause a deep skepticism in pretty much everything but most prominently in perception. If we can never assume uniformity of nature, then every inference about the future and the future based on the past is invalid. Thus wouldn't the rejection of induction restrict us to only be able to talk validly about our present phenomenal experiences or whatever is directly present in the mind? What are the practical ramifications of rejecting induction? It seems that it would throw us all into intense skepticism. 

The only truth you can take is that in the language your using is formed as a function of the subject experiencing the object and the logic contained within the subject. Every thought you think is a consequence in the language you use and sequentially forms grammitical sentences based up your perception when you experienced learning it. Every thought you will ever have will be based up your level of knowledge of the dictionary of it and the rules learnt from your logic in the perception of the grammar and the construction of thoughts using the grammer and the dictionary. So yes for all intents and purpose yes we may be all experiencing a self induced simulation the means of which to perpetuate the need of the subject and the object the definition of which we have because of the difference observed. And the subject cannot directly observe itself only retropectively, but in the picture of it's self is dependent upon the language gained through objective experience and similarly limited in the reflection of it. The subject and object has to be experienced concurrently and a pyramid of simulation would have to occur simultaneously as a memory of sequence would occur that could question the nature of the object we are subject to and since I don't recall that memory to dispel the object I carry on lol. Since The persitance of memory shapes the subject from information in experiencing the object and gives us our only fact. It becomes a lonely world out there and therefore maybe faith is a greater truth than fact, as each is similarly indeterminate but the later I think more purpose. Well that was a load of flannel just keep your sense of humour mate. Sorry invidullators I should keep this discussion professional I know. And take a load of the grammar I use, l know my limitations :). 

From what I've collected, Quine seemed to have solved the problem of non-being by using Russell's theory of definite descriptions through the negation of the x having certain properties/descriptions. However, I hear Kripke rejected Russell's definite descriptions. How did Kripke solve the problem of non-being with his theory of reference? 

I am aware that Kant addressed Hume's skepticism on causality, but I don't see anything in his CPR that solves the problems of induction and uniformity of nature in other contexts like everyday life, where Hume's question, "will the sun rise tomorrow?" seems to persist. Exactly how does/would Kant solve the problems of induction (particularly uniformity of nature) in non-causal contexts, if he did at all? I am aware that there has already been a question like this, but I thought the answer to it only addressed induction in the context of causal formulations about the world; in this respect, I think Kant only dodged the problem of induction in causal formulations by solidifying causality as an intuition. Rationalizing your belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and rationalizing your belief that C-fiber firing causes pain seem to be two different things. 

Your argument is a consequence of the logic of the language you used to form it in morality and immorality and its observed concept and the language used to communicate it. Society or people in fact everything is limited by what physically is possible and what is not and the perception of a causal nature in the result of a choice in action of the possible and a return in the perceived pleasure or pain of that action or from experience of a similar action. I have felt also guilt from my actions now I don't know if its a result of conditioning of society or an absolute return in the nature of a choice I took and a fundament of an immoral act. Society judges immoral act upon a notion of guilt and an attempt to keep order from that guilt but its hard to say if every immoral act judged by society results in a guilty feeling absolutely and should accumulate a social judgement of morality from that percieved guilty feeling. 

To my knowledge, the correspondence theory of truth posits that a proposition is true iff there are states of affairs that reflect what the proposition indicates. E.g. "Snow is white" is true iff snow is actually white; truth becomes a property that arises from the mirroring of states of affairs in propositions. But how is this different from deflationism? Isn't "'Snow is white' is true iff snow is white" begging the question of what "iff snow is white" means? I'm confused on what the difference is between these accounts of truth as deflationism just seems like a shorthand for using correspondence as a central truth criterion. To say "'Snow is white' iff snow is white" means the same thing as its correspondence counterpart. 

After reading Kant's Idea For a Universal History, I've become intrigued by Kant's notion of Nature guiding the dealings of men towards a "perfectly rightful civil constitution." Although the relationship between man and Nature remains clear, what would Kant say is the meaning for any human existence independent of Nature? Perhaps there is some overlap between the meaning of human life simpliciter and the meaning of human life in relation with Nature?
