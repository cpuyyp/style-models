If it is Magwitch, he would not need to ask all of these questions since he had met Pip and knew his name as well as meeting Joe when he was captured in the marshes as a runaway convict, so I don't think it is him. The man also mentions this at the pub, when he is told Mr. Wopsle is the church clerk: 

(I would not count articles such as 'the' and 'a' as separating words) Is the 'f' sound in the words "fair" and "first" still classed as alliteration in conjunction with the alliteratory phrases "foam flew" and "furrow followed free"? Or are they too separate to be alliteration? If words between the alliteratory words is permitted, then how many? I have tried to research this but have been unsuccessful in finding a rule that clarifies whether or not several (let's say more than two) non-allitoratory words between alliteratory words 'takes away' the alliteration. 

As regards the final book (terminating the series) it would appear that the author wasn't especially pleased with it either. 

The same 'Guardian Newspaper - notes and queries' page contains an extended quote from John Fisher's The Magic of Lewis Carroll.

Of course, that book tells the story of how the animals rebel against the farmer who runs their farm -- the Russian imperial regime -- how they establish a revolution, and how the revolution is then gradually subverted into a new class system in which the pigs, who are the brains of the outfit, become a new, tyrannical ruling class. And the animals find themselves in just as bad a situation as they were in before. "1984: An Interview with George Orwell" 

If you try to say the line with the stresses like this, it is really awkward. The trochaic tetrameter just fits better. (Using iambic stressing on the line would also only result in three stresses making it iambic trimeter.) It is in fact the same rhythm and stress pattern and meter, as the lines from Macbeth: 

There are four stresses to the line (resulting in a tetrameter) each with the stress on the first, not the following, syllable (resulting in trochaic meter). Iambic tetrameter is the reverse of trochaic tetrameter as the unstressed syllable comes before the stressed syllable. If it was iambic, the stresses would look like this: 

It is in trochaic tetrameter, because there are four trochees in the first line, as you highlighted in your copy (numbers indicate stress number): 

(As a side note, the irony of the Angel and Liza-Lu match is that in the Victorian era, it was forbidden to marry your sister-in law as she was considered to be like a sister by blood, hence Angel's comment "And she is my sister-in-law"; this does make their prospective marriage even more bizarre. So perhaps the match was also included to exude shock from contemporary readers.) Liza-Lu is known to be nearly sixteen (4 years younger than Tess), the age Tess was when she went to the Chase with Alec, and so Tess sees their union as a chance for Liza-Lu to achieve Tess's own aspirations, marry Angel, and not fall prey to disgrace.

Note that has outlined by Beastly Gerbil, the protagonist is living through events based on Borges's on life: in his novel, the protagonist hits a recently painted door jamb, while in his autobiography, Borges hits a freshly painted open casement window. The reference to fresh paint seems to make no doubt of the biographical nature of the event. The many political and literary references that populate the story always had me believe that this story was about the implication of writers in politics. 

Writers, Borges seems to make the case, do not get to choose when they fight or when they don't fight political power, but much the opposite.

(Emphasis by myself) I believe this is strong, yet not compelling evidence towards Golding writing Simon an epileptic. 

Even though Angel admits that she was "more sinned against than sinning" he cannot forgive her as society's expectations were very different for women. They were expected to be strictly moral but men's actions to the contrary were brushed under the carpet. In our time we cannot comprehend this injustice, but as early 20th century critic Norman Page noted: 

The definition for spondees is: a metrical foot consisting of two long or stressed syllables, which the line is describing with "long and long". The second line is also separate from the first with a semicolon at the end of the first, so they are definitely unrelated. The real question is why is the second line not in spondees? I cannot find any explanations for this, apart from that the stressed 'o' sounds in the line act to emphasise the spondees in the next line. Also, in old copies of S. T. Coleridge's poems, where the lines are scanned, line 2 is sometimes left unscanned (along with the second part of the poem, which deviates away from describing meter and addresses his son), so maybe it is not meant to have a definite meter (sort does make a rhyming couplet with short so that could be the reason for this rogue line). Regardless of line 2, the line about trochees is definitely in catalectic trochaic meter. 

You may wish to note that senior Firemen, aware of the constant presence of temptation to which their men are subject, will often turn a blind eye to relatively severe transgressions (such as the taking and reading of the books that they're expected to burn). 

KA Applegate did a Reddit IAMA session in 2001. The implication seems to be that her decision to stop writing the Everworld novels was driven by dramatically declining sales figures compared to the large commitment required to generate new novels. 

Out-of-universe it's fairly obviously a writing error, perhaps one that will be corrected in a future edition. 

The (error?) tobacco reference is also found in my (eBook) copy. In-universe there are a few possible options. ". Presumably it's mixed with something else, possibly chocolate. John is extremely surprised to see the Professor. Perhaps in his haste and shock he simply misspoke, mistaking cinnamon for chocolate.
