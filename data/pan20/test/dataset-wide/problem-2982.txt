White and Black are two poles labeled by the same category, Colour. But this is not the category what counter-position them as opposites. Within category colour, both this and that can reside inertly and alternate one to another from time to time without any tension implied by playing "opposite". "Before" black could become an opposite to white, white itself must be attenuated as white in its core being. As @PeterJ put in his answer, "A contradiction must be A/not-A, and not A/B". So, white must first be able to emerge as not white. Negation of a being/identity of one pole is the necessary condition of the other (or some another) pole to start being its opposite. Somebody here says, the opposite of A is not B but not-A. Not quite so. Not-A isn't being to have a status of something. Opposite is B, a something, however the prerequisite what makes it opposite to A is that A can not-be-A in its being A. But the negation is not logical or linguistic trick, it is real. It is not a cognitive action (of mind playing with concepts like with cards); rather, it is what happens with a thing (such as this white paper) in the world. Our consciousness has pre-rational, intuitive apprehension of non-being aspect of things - because (to quote Sartre) consciousness or "human reality" is the only one thanks to which nonbeing comes to things. Therefore it is silly to start with pure concepts and categories. Before that, there exists this white paper, which, as I look at it (while doing my current living process) inevitably corrupts into "not so white". The ulcer on the being (the deficit of white) gets paved by some imaginary compensation - and I begin to find the paper partly yellow. Yellow will be the opposite to white from now on. Then I skip my thoughts to the pen I was holding in preparation to write, I see the black scribble appearing - black is now the opposite to white. Pelican could be a perfect contrary to black (actually, I might find my paper devours ink like a white pelican). So, white exists as meaningful attribute in my actions with the sheet and in incessant partial self-rejection which produces contraries without killing white. Opposites are thus secondary, they pend on our intrinsic ability to attenuate identity of entities. Alternatives emerge in compensation to the lack of identity and in vague promise to restore it, the clearness of white paper, by a complement (black letters) via synthesis (paper with words written on it is potentially more white than it was before because it appears to excuse its whiteness by making it necessary for words to appear, not simply by colour contrast). Opposites nascend, initially, as near-by, not as poles far apart. The most opposite is a neighbour next door. 

But I've argued (from a perspective close to be Sartrian, as I hope) that even in experiments of automatic reactions such as ticks or reflexes or robot-induced moves - we remain fully free. Therefore contrasting simple automatisms with "writing a sentence" about subjective experience, i.e. the complexity, is not a way to prove qualia of consciousness or disprove determinism. The "more plausibly attributed" argument is not, to me, a right way to defend against @Chelonian's arguments. Just consciousness with its freedom and mechanics with its determinism are two nonintersecting domains, neither of the two can penetrate the other to strike. They also are on different levels: I agree with those saying consciousness is an ontologic concept (i.e. it exists before [individual] world is possible), while mechanics (in wide sense of the word) is ontic: it needs entities already existing, and it implies there is "reality" totally independent of consciousness (so it is another reality than that consciousness could inhabit). In my comments to @Chelonian's answer (all comments therein are found now in chat) I've expressed the opinion that a brain (neurons) or a computer can never (or at least in our age having our baggage of outlooks and ways to formulate thought) be conscious, even if it is much more clever than man at tasks and learning; because computer cannot conceive of, say, 2<>2 (break of self-identity of an entity) whereas man's consiousness does it every minute. 

A useful something is an effective instrument to reach some objective. A valuable something is a moving back goal. Appreciate the difference between "objective" and "goal". Objective belongs to the indifferent field of universe with its disposition of entities; a human there in this respect is akin to a stone or a rain. In "bread is useful for your life" life is an object among objects, it is not your life but life attributed to you like a state, and bread is a fuel to support that objective state. Goal is humanitarian matter (so it is a different perspective), it is about my (or your) aspiration. If/when I don't have goal, I don't have values. Objective implies there can be ways to achieve it, it implies usefulness of things. Goal does not necessarily imply the existence of ways to reach, the utilities. Value is a special sort of goal. We can feel something as valuable only when that goal is unreachible in full (or exactly) while we aspire to get it. Every value(able smth) is like a masterpiece in a museum: you are deprived of right to posess it whatever strong your want be. Note that it is not "objective state of de-licensing" but one's experience that his goal in its clean or complete form is elusive. Only then it is "valuable". We cannot fill up with a "valuable". And mind takes it: "agree to mourn" with the thing we love. A bit aphoristically: Value is what separates me from what I appear not while in view to be it. (It is the counter-part of possibility which is what separates me from what I appear by taking away the base/cause to be it.) Because thus value is by definition unreachible (of which I'm aware while pretending to reach) there can exist no instrument believed (authentically) to help to reach - no any useful matter. Neither value itself is useful (in the definition I stack to) nor it is surrounded by "useful" means. It is a mistake to treat utility like value or mix "useful" with "valuable". 

You did not understand Sartre correctly. When he says people will choose freedom (of actions) he means in that passage that they are better to appreciate/recognize the fact they are already free, instead of haunting their "bad faith" which conceals the fact of freedom in order to escape anxiety and responsibility. For, to Sartre man is condemned to be free. In honesty (authentity) or in bad faith (self-deception) - no matter, a man remains free; he cannot exist otherwise but free. So, "the quest of freedom as such" is simply the project to be honest and get along with that (only) human nature, the freedom. It is logical and practical sane call, in Sartre's view. We don't choose freedom, he says, so let's appreciate that we are free. Somebody who in their lives had occasional insights that, for example, their lover or a friend or a pet is worthy only thanks to them (the subjects) and through them, will understand Sartre saying "values depend upon himself". Sartre's existentialism always has had problems with ethics. Positive morals are not easy to derive from basically a "nihilistic" philosophy. Sartre called up to respect everyone's not only my freedom. He also held that a man should be acting, re-doing his self. Somebody very keen has proclamed the moral maxima of any phenomenologic-based existential system as "act such as if you were not", because for Sartre and his philosophical peers a man has no access to his own being since he's free. 

This looks true. But the previous conscious experience is dependent on the "next", the expected. If we remember the preceeding/past experience and it has meaning, this is because we are projecting ourselves into future. It is the possible our future (which we are by the mode of nonbeing) that attaches meaning (and hence articulatedness) to the past. I.e. past is pending on future; it is but due to future that an experience becomes past. And that is thanks to consciousness. The future is not dependent on the past, for consciousness, because consciousness is free. However, possibilities (the future) that we will discover or discern shall emerge on the ground of the past: it is conditioning, not determination (a condition is a passive limitation). So, time arises as temporalization where future precedes past, and between the two there is the absolute link-division in the form of Nothing. And here is where consciousness is found. While the naive (psychical, physical, common sense) time operates on "mental" objects exactly the way it does with "external" objects; and here is no room for consciousness. For, indeed, there is no anything in consciousness; it is void of content. So called "thoughts" have nothing to do with consciousness proper - they are objects in the world, only irreal ones. Consciousness is empty activity and its only function is the flight from facticity to some own possibility, existing by the mode of non-being. (Roughly saying it, the run from a stagnant to a meaningful.) This what Sartre calls the project and other somewhat close words to it are intention, prereflective conception, temptation.

[This answer was written sooner as a reaction to the discussion broke in comments to @Chelonian's answer, than as a focused answer to the OP question. So it may look off-topic. Yet I've decided after some hesitation not to remove my response. As a particular, phenomenologic p.o.v. (seeing mind-body dilemma as a false one), it could be of some interest, and to me it is certainly not off-topic] When I'm jerking back my arm from this boiling water in front of me, I automatically take my that action upon myself. Not I started the movement (but subcortex and muscles) but everything looks like (and not the other way) just 1/10 sec later as if it was me who thought out / decided to withdraw. Such is the property of pre-reflective consciousness (but not of my Ego, mind) - to "ascribe" everything to oneself; and that consciousness is anonymous, faceless. But where is freedom here? So far we see only responsibility, or taking any "guilt" upon oneself. The freedom is in that the meaning of the situation, - including of my action, for the start of which I wasn't responsible objectively, - wasn't determined by anything (while the jerk was determined at its start), it was a random selection by spontaneous consciousness of one possibility out of some possibilities. Might I have not withdraw my arm? I wasn't in the power to at the beginning of the movement, right; but I might have quickly catch it, deciding to endure, or, 2 sec later might have return the arm back in the boiling stream. Also, I might have scream as I were jerking it or might have simply open wide my eyes. A continuation, development ot the primary bodily reaction was tied with and correlative to the meaning; but the latter was applied by my consciousness freely by selecting from a number of possibilities (of being me-in-the-here-world) implied in and admissible by the circumstance. What does it mean that was "free"? It means it was in the regime of dissociation from the givenneses provided to consciousness, i.e. in the mode of their annihilation. The hot stream, and the pain, were highly appreciated - exactly in order them not to meddle in the sudden decision. Consciousness feels that it doesn't base itself on anything when it chooses. May there be that this "freedom of choice in void" is just an epiphenomenon, consciousness' illusion, and really that some data, stalking unobserved, have determined my choice over the meaning and the action? Yes, that may be, but I'll never know that myself. Other people might tell me this later, or I myself might say it in explanation to myself, - but it never will be evidence (like the sense of freedom was) and never become credible enough: it will be a matter of trust (like all theories of objective reality are).
