If he's adept, he'd sound like a human on a high-quality audio system. All sound, including speech, is the result of vibrations in the air. There is no difference between vocal cords, cone speakers, and your "manipulating air to produce sound" being because they all "manipulate air to produce sound." So, "vocal" quality is the result of how adept the being is at manipulating the air. If he's good, he sounds like Bing Crosby. If he's not, he sounds like an early Apple II speech synthesizer. 

A weapon in a demigod's hand is an extension of that being. It can become embued with attributes from its master. But the moment a bullet leaves a gun, it is no longer in contact with its master. No matter what it's made of... it's just a bullet. Even in the case where the demigod has the attribute of telekinesis, all he/she can do is influence the remote object. It can be pushed around (if even a demigod can think at the speed of a bullet. I mean, you have, what, a tenth of a second max to influence the projectile's flight?) but basically nothing more. In your world, demigods are the masters of what they possess — literally, not figuratively. In other words, while they may rule over a land and its people, they cannot actually change, influence, or afflict a person unless touching them. While my previous comment suggested the limitation of something like telekinesis, now that I think about it, I'd remove even that. Demigods are not gods. They have limitations. In my case, what this means is... 

That's 2-4 weeks. Let's assume the worst-case of 2 weeks. But, what really happened? Here is where the OP needs to make a story decision about how the pregnancies are failing. Are they miscarriages? Are they actual unferilizable eggs? This is REALLY IMPORTANT because there are two possibilities... (A) All those excited-to-see-what-happens-next women experience menstration. (B) Or they don't. Let's go with (A) first... Our knee-jerk reaction is that sales of pregnancy tests would drop. But, as @Alexander points out, that's actually not true. In fact, the data identifying a problem will be hidden in the wash of real life. First of all, all those babies concieved the day before "the event" are testing happily positive. The pregnancy test companies need to watch for a trend to develop, because it won't initially be a step function. But, in this case, it won't develop fast enough. Because those enchanting evenings really haven't stopped (at least one hopes they haven't stopped...). Which means even if the OP's decision is (A), things just keep on rolling untill the next month. Honestly, how many women successfully conceive after a single encounter? According to this source the odds are only about 20% at best and drop with age very quickly. So now we're up to 7-8 weeks before a real, detectable trend can be seen. Now the obstetricians mentioned by @RonJohn are starting to see an odd decrease in new-baby patients that can't be explained by a lack of black-outs, a lack of a successful World Series win, or the lack of any of the many other reasons that couples celebrate. And during all that time women keep buying pregnancy tests in the hopes that this time it'll be positive. From the perspective of (A), the doctors will identify a detectable trend before the pregnancy test people do because, well... hope springs eternal and the tests are cheaper than a visit with the doc. At this point: doctors discover the issue first in 7-8 weeks after "the event." But what happens if the OP chooses (B)? Here's where @StephenG's comment becomes important. If the OP's answer is (B) then sales TANK because all those women think they're pregnant. They tank like New Coke. They tank in a way that makes Fox News and CNN agree on something. However, even this takes a little time. A week, maybe ten days past menstration. So, the pregnancy test (PT) people in this scenario could see a detectable trend in 3-4 weeks (remember what the quote above tells you about the body needing time...). But, are the PT people really the first? Maybe not... because the real problem here is when all those happy women visit their doctors and the doctors see (1) an explosion of new-baby visits and (2) those visits all have really bad news... no pregnancy. This would be a very-fast-to-detect trend, a lot of new pregnancies that aren't really pregnancies (be they miscarriages or any other unannounced reason). The statistics would be blaring. Which means while the PT people could be the first to know, it's still unlikely because they're behind the prenatal care curve. I still believe the doctors would know first. But the data is still a bit hidden. Remember all those pregnancies that happened in the days before "the event." That will muddy the water for a while. Maybe 1-2 weeks before the doctors really start realizing that more women are coming in with false pregnancy problems than are with successful pregnancy issues. You'd think it would be hard to dismiss the "You know, Nurse Chapel, that's the fifth woman this week with a false-positive. That's a bit weird, dontchathink?" reaction, but remember that 20% and less chance to become pregnant at all. Unless "the event" also causes women to conceive at 100%... but this answer is long enough already. So, in this case, 4-5 weeks. 

The Human Genome Project began "on a napkin" in 1984 and was declared complete in 2003. That's 19 years with access to overwhelming computational power. So, no, you can't manipulate DNA without computers. 

And now we make an assumption. What do you mean by "machinery?" Do you include small engine repair? Do you include manual printing presses? Have we lost basic metallurgical skills along with our "high tech" skills? Have we lost the ability to make a push lawn mower or a pair of manual hedge trimmers? You see my problem, of course. Sending us back to the 1500's would mean destroying all the data and everyone above the age of, say, 7. (Now we're talking about the Star Trek TOS episode Miri, which isn't dissimlar to Logan's Run. Let's stick with just loosing the high-tech stuff. Basically, the ability to create a 1970s computer or newer, but maybe we still can figure out how to get an old coal electric plant running (unless they've been computerized...). How long would it take to forget all that? As long as it takes for the last person to remember it to die, because there's so much involved with making a computer (design, fabrication, manufacturing, and software) plus all the modern infrastructure for it to be useful (everything from electrical power to the Internet) that there's no practical way for said person (if it's possible for just one person to have all that in their head. I feel safe saying it's not possible) to pass that information along. TL;DR: 30-60 years. 

A metal shield tower shield, insulated near the arm and head areas with wool, and trailing a short length of wire on the ground, would improve your chances against fire and electrical attacks. Your gauntlets would either need to be lined with rubber, or the grip of the shield lined with rubber, to insulate against the electricity. Note that this would only help with a directed attack and not an area-of-effect attack. You're cooked with an AoE attack. Best, then, to put an arrow in the magician's eye first. If you know the magician has electrical spells and not fire, then a wooden shield would be much more valuable. Finally, it's always worth noting that the attack volume or duration will always have the ability to overcome non-magical armor. throw enough fire or electricity at our intrepid plate-mail paladin, or throw it for a long enough period, and it won't matter how the shield is designed. It'll either become hot enough to ignite the wool and melt the rubber, or so over charged that it might become magnetic and stick to your cuirass, binding your arm along with it. 

Let's take an example from piezoelectricity. Piezoelectricity is the generation of electricity from pressure. Simplistically, you stand on a piezoelectric plate and a light bulb turns on due to the elecricty generated by your mass applied to the plate. Let's assume we can create some form of unobtainium that is both piezoelectric and indestructable. An artificial singularity could be created and stuffed inside said globe. Because our globe is perfectly round1 and we were able to place the singularity at precisely the center, the result is a singularity that is pulling in on the globe uniformly and therefore won't move. The globe, of course, has an electrode connected to the inside of the globe passing though an equally indestructable but perfectly insulating insulator to a point ouside the globe. A second electrode is connected to the outside of the sphere. This gives us plus and minus voltage references. Depending on how much the globe is allowed to compress, you now have an abundant source of electricty until the singularity dissipates (or until some idiot bumps the globe, allowing the singularity to go off-balance, sucking in the mass of the globe, the planet, and finally the moon, leaving the sun to become a binary star. It's all very dramatic. Let's call that idiot "Harold." No offense to any Harolds reading this answer.) A fundamental problem is keeping the singularity in one place. Equally pulling is not as convenient as equally pushing. Equally pushing means you could move the globe (within limits) and the singularity would stay in place... but it pulls. Equally pulling means once you've figured out how to keep the two synchronously in place, you can't touch it. We can come up with all kinds of handwavium solutions to drawing energy from the singularity—but now you have two real problems to overcome. From the other answers: sustaining the singularity. From mine: keeping it in place. 

A delightful evening ensued (if you need more detail than this, you're on the wrong SE site). And the next morning, we go to work. 

I'm fond of a phrase I've coined: "technology dichotomy." You can't, for example, expect to have time travel without first inventing the wheel. How does this apply to your question? Recycling technology preceeded space travel by a long, long way. Aristotle understood the basics of desalination. In other words, it is a technology dichotomy to have an interplanetary space ship without reclamation. Next, add inefficiency. The cost of tanks to hold all the water you need without reclamation, plus the tanks for waste, the fuel to move it all ... all because you don't want to recycle. Finally, add the benefits of recycling. In an emergency, you can ration and use reclamation to survive for a very long time. Without it, once you've drunk the last drop in the tank, you're basically dead. Techniques could be used to make sure there is always adequate radition shielding, such as inner and outer tanks, one to hold source water, and one to hold waste such that there is always a minimum amount of water between you and outer space... but we're layering solution-upon-solution just to avoid reclamation, which is a millenial-old science and an obviously-available technology. ...And this all assumes you can drink water that has been used for radiation shielding. Various sources (1, 2) suggest irradiated water is unlikely to be a problem. But I'm not sure I want to drink the water and wait for the warm, fuzzy feeling. IfyouknowwhatImean... They're not testing water that has been used for interplanetary radiation shielding. You're probably looking for shock value, but in reality, keeping the shielding and hydration sources separate is far more efficient, meaning a more cost-effective operation. If you don't do it, your competitor will, just to save fuel costs if nothing else. I'm not a nuclear physicist, but I suspect a layer of heavy water (deuterium oxide or 2H2O) would be a better radiation shield than regular water or urine, and that your ship would only carry enough water to compensate for loss due to imperfect reclamation and emergencies. As for flesh. I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're thinking of a biologically-grown shielding and that you're not putting people or animals at risk. Either way, flesh would be an unlikely candidate for raditation shielding due to its tendency to suffer from Melanoma, better known as "skin cancer," which is caused by radiation.
