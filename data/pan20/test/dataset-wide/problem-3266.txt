You will not get anywhere by trying to divide events as historical or political. The same thing can be both, and it depends on how you approach it. History is any event that is approached with a historical mindset - using the tools of historical research. A political scientist or political commentator could approach the same events as political events. The distinction is not in the event. Therefore, I don't think you can set any cutoff point to determine if something is an historical event or not. Even a current event happening live - like, perhaps, Russia annexing the Crimea - is a historical event. Good commentary on it would involve a political commentator to give a political explanation of what is happening, but also a historian to give the historical perspective. Events do not occur in a vacuum, and there's always an historical context. The same can be applied to any relevant discipline. A movie comes out. Is this a cultural event? An historical event? An entertainment-history event? The answer is, of course, all of the above, depends on how you interpret it. 

All these shows (and other works of fiction) go back, at most, around 2,500-3,000 years. Anatomically modern man, so-called homo sapiens sapiens, is usually thought to have arisen around 150,000-200,000 years ago. So from an evolutionary viewpoint, these timeframes are mostly irrelevant - people haven't changed much between early Greek times and the Middle Ages, and neither have other animals. It's just too brief a period for major evolutionary change. What has happened to animals over that time is domestication - the artificial selection and breeding of animals, which began (according to Wikipedia), around 6000 years ago. I'm not entirely sure what horses looked like back then, though. Genetically they were similar to today's horses, but since we can see huge differences between different horse breeds, even though they're the same species, we can suppose that Spartan horses in the 6th century BC might have been different from horses used by Scandinavians in the 8th century AD. As for the question of how long they've been on Earth - it's hard to answer. "Horses", of some definition, have been around for millions of years, though only at some point could they be considered identical to today's horses. And as for why you keep seeing them everywhere, whether in historical accounts, historical fiction or history-inspired fiction is just because they're so useful. Horses were used by any civilization they were introduced to because they are strong, reliable animals for work and transportation. Goats are used for milk and meat and keeping greenery under control. Man domesticated animals for their usefulness, and horses and goats, alongside the rest of the farmhouse gang, are very useful. 

However, in the past decades, so-called Mode 2 science has risen to the forefront. Again, from Wikipedia, quoting Camille Limoges: 

More than 200 locations in the USA were proposed. But first there was a choice of continent and country 

A song lyric from a modern western pop-band isn't the sort of place I would look for authoritative information about cultural practices in pre-communist China. There are accounts of such practices in Chinese death rituals (in Singapore)

We can speculate a little. From what little I've read, the US acted through the CIA, who provided funding to groups in Iran, created propaganda against Prime Minister Mossadeq and advised & encouraged the Shah in various ways. It doesn't seem that there was an overt use of US miltary force. Article 2 of the UN charter could arguably be interpreted as mainly prohibiting the use, or threat of, of military force by one state against another. Perhaps it could be argued that advice, propaganda and money are not (military) force. If the matter had been raised in the UN Security Council, the US or UK could have used their veto powers to block any resolution. 

In December 1978 Deng Xiaoping an "open door policy" that allowed foreign companies to set up in China. Prior to that, foreigners were not allowed to invest in China. Foreigners mostly were excluded, even as tourists. China's Communist party essentially turned its back on central planning and state-ownership of all means of production and adopted a capitalist economic model while retaining a one-party political system under the control of the communist party. The availability of an extremely low-wage workforce, led to Western manufacturers transferring manufacturing facilities and knowledge to China. 

My emphasis. So I don't think the premise is justified, people often use the adjective "German" to refer to people, organisations and products of that era. 

Reference to the German State of 1939-1945 is implicitly a reference to the Nazi party. So it is natural to use the word Nazi in order to make a justifiably clear distinction between that government and it's predecessors and successors. However I don't think we no longer refer to Germans of that period as Germans. Most people know that not all Germans of that era were ever members of the National Socialist (Nazi) party. Many Germans would have been members of other political parties or of none. In particular, we do not, under any circumstances, refer to as Nazis those Germans who were members of persecuted minorities and many or most of whom were murdered in Nazi death camps. Many products of that era are referred to as German products and not as Nazi products, even when strongly associated with the results of Nazi policy. For example: 

Germany failed to achieve air and naval superiority over the English Channel, which meant that they could not launch a land invasion (Operation Sea Lion). This left both sides in a stalemate. Hitler had been planning to invade the Soviet Union anyway, so with the British seemingly contained the Wehrmacht was free to launch its invasion of the Soviet Union. Hitler also thought that the Soviet Union could be quickly defeated and therefore did not worry about a two-front war. 

There are a number of reasons why the Germans did not pull back for the defense of Berlin. The short answer is that they simply couldn't. The Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS were still ordered to conduct major offensives even in 1945. The Battle of the Bulge was the last major German offensive in the West, but upon its failure elite units from I and II SS Panzer Corps (which had participated in the Battle of the Bulge) were sent to the East and ordered to conduct another major offensive called Operation Spring Awakening. Spring Awakening took place as far east as Hungary and as late in the war as March 1945. It was the last major German offensive in the East and was a failure. The Soviets had well prepared defenses against the German offensive and had prepared a major offensive of their own. They launched a massive counterattack after Spring Awakening failed. The German units were overrun while the Soviets raced toward Berlin. Soviet units raced each other to Berlin to claim the distinction of capturing the Nazi capital. The Soviets covered ground quickly: they broke through the last major German defensive line on April 19, started shelling Berlin itself on April 20 (Hitler's birthday), and captured Berlin by May 2. The quick Soviet victory was due not only to their motivation to capture Berlin, but also by the fact that the Soviets had over 1 million troops against only about 100,000 German defenders. Meanwhile, the surviving German units that had been overrun were low on fuel for what little armor they had left and could not hope to catch the Soviets racing to Berlin. Even if the Wehrmacht had the fuel and armor to retreat back to Berlin in time they were often ordered by Hitler not to retreat at any cost, which often resulted in their encirclement and destruction. These overrun units probably would not have made much difference anyway given the vast Soviet numerical superiority. The story was largely the same for the Luftwaffe. At the beginning of 1945 the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte to support German ground units during the Battle of the Bulge but the operation was a failure resulting in the loss of a large number of aircraft and pilots. By this time the Allied air forces were much stronger than the Luftwaffe, which was suffering from severe shortages in aircraft, fuel, and pilots (and many Luftwaffe fighters were destroyed on the ground). With such severe shortages Luftwaffe personnel were typically assigned to help the Wehrmacht Heer, Waffen-SS, and the Volkssturm in a ground role (operating the feared 88s, for example). Remnants of some Luftwaffe units were still able to fly limited combat missions (including the famous JG 52, which operated in Czechoslovakia) in support of local German ground forces, but they were so short on pilots and aircraft that they had no hope of inflicting serious damage to Soviet air or ground units. In summary, the best German units were sent far into the east for a final offensive and were overrun. The Soviets had prepared a massive offensive and quickly crushed the German defenders before the overrun German units would have had a chance to fall back to defend Berlin. The Luftwaffe could do little to help due to aircraft and pilot shortages, so Luftwaffe personnel typically supported the defense of Berlin in a ground role.
