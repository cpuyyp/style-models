Special: Hemargentum - silver - brownish black - I made it up The purpose of these "carrier" materials is to make oxygen transportation more efficient. The ocellated icefish does not need a carrier material because it lives in water that is highly oxygenated already. Carrying this over to silver, the obvious transport compound would be silver oxide. Unfortunately, I believe silver oxide is chemical difficult to make, and this would result in a lot of wasted energy. There's also the possibility of silver sulfate (Ag2SO4). Unfortunately, the standard way to create silver sulfate requires silver nitrate (AgNO3), and if you already have silver nitrate, I can't imagine turning it into silver sulfate is going to buy you more efficient energy transfer. The problem I keep running into is that figuring out a plausible reason for something to have silver-based blood requires some deep organic chemistry knowledge. I hope I've given you a start, but you might need to find some biochemistry boards to ask on instead. 

Actually, people have tried for a very long time to domesticate animals like lions, and it doesn't work the same way; some animals are much easier to domesticate than others. Generally speaking, you need: 

Post-family warfare: your warriors are people who have finished having children. Problem: they are not as fit as younger people. Sterile women. Most of the women in the society are sterile, and more sterile women are born than men. This is your "drone" situation, makes me a little uncomfortable talking about it. Strictly enforced mating-for-life. And I don't mean, "Puritan Christians will shun you and put a badge on your clothes if you're caught cheating." I mean some kind of biological switch whereby, once you're with someone, you are fully repulsed by anyone else. In this scenario, you'd want an equal number of men and women to die in war, since any imbalance would cause a breeding bottleneck. Also, all widows/widowers are drafted into military service. 

To hypnotize someone, you must get them into a hypnotic state. This requires significant effort on the part of the participant, and is not something that can passively be done without their active cooperation. 

It should be simple enough to have there be a combination of too rocky and poor soil for sustained plant life. It could be a great salt flat, for instance. The large rivers would have washed out the salt from their local environment, but everywhere around them is still too salinated for plant life. So, 1 and 2 are yes. 3 is a no, for obvious reasons, if you think about it. If there were large amounts of trees, it would not be a desert, it would be a forest. For some amounts of trees, look to the river flood plains. The flood plains would wash away enough of the salt for plant life to grow. It's likely this is where 99% of the farms would be, including any timber farms. Most likely, however, lumber would be imported; it's more important for food to be local, since it's more perishable. 

No Under normal circumstances, humans breathe through their noses, acquiring their base-line required amount of oxygen. Under strain (physical exertion, stress, etc.), humans breathe through their mouths to acquire more oxygen faster than they normally get through the nose. In other words, humans have already solved the "mouth breathing problems": we have a nose for most breathing, but can still breathe through the mouth when necessary. 

A good real-world example of this is ancient Egypt. They had a polytheistic religion, and several gods were directly associated with particular regions of Egypt. The regions would then fight, and the winner would indicate whose god was stronger. This often made it into the mythology; for instance, the domination of Set by Horus. Basically, as long as the gods of your world have conflict with each other, conflict among their followers is not only possible but inevitable. And if the gods are gone... Well, all it takes is a charismatic leader to convince people that, no, really, you have to kill those heathens for your own good, for their own good, it's what Our Lord would want, would require of you. And since our Lord isn't around to dispute it... 

No and Yes Uplifting, by its very definition, includes the intention to bring a species to sapience. So, one cannot accidentally Uplift a species. That being said, of course one species can accidentally increase/change the intelligence of another. For instance, dogs are the only non-human species that understand pointing. Does that make them more generally smarter? No, but it shows that we can impact specific intelligence patterns, which means we could also impact general intelligence. As for how much intelligence can be influenced, well, just look at humans. We didn't evolve in a vacuum. Who's to say other apes or lions or zebras or something didn't accidentally force us into sapience (certainly wasn't intentional on their part)? You can't skip the several hundred thousand years of natural selection; without gene splicing, everything you're doing is natural selection, even if you're consciously directing the breeding. But, you can make natural selection go in a direction you want it to go. See, evolution isn't a straight line, "unintelligent" on one side, "sapient" on the other; chimps are not still evolving into humans because they are fully-evolved chimps that are evolving into the chimps of the future. Without particular selective influences, there's no reason to think chimps will ever evolve sapience in the wild, even on an infinite timeline. After all, there's only one sapient species on this planet, and it's not like jellyfish haven't had just as long to develop intelligence as we have. If we wanted sapient {whatever}, likely the only way to do it (without gene splicing) would be to intentionally breed for intelligence for a few hundred thousand (or million) years. It takes that long because you're only getting changes with every generation, every generation takes several years to mature, and you aren't guaranteed improvements with each generation. Further, humans have one of the longest childhoods relative to our size, and it's thought this is because of our intelligence. As you increase an animal's intelligence, it's likely the childhood of that animal will lengthen as well. Which means, ultimately, that some crazy billionaire is going to gene-splice an uplifted {whatever} way before you breed one. I've heard we're really only a couple decades of dedicated research away from uplifting primates, it's just that no one wants to step in that moral quagmire. If that's true (even if it's off by a factor of ten), gene splicing will Uplift a species before selective breeding even if your starting point for breeding was 40,000 years ago (about the time dogs started getting domesticated). 

And this is your smallest problem. Let's talk about knees. Grasshopper legs move in kind of a special way (bottom left picture). This is entirely due to their shape driving their muscular requirements. If you tried to make a human-shaped knee withstand walking pressure while bent like a grasshoppers, it would put all the pressure on the tendons. As anyone with a torn ACL can tell you, you don't want to put all the pressure on the tendons. So, you're stuck with a pin joint knee. The problem with pin joint knees are that they put all the pressure on the pin. And pins are pretty small relative to the rest of the creature. This matters less in insects (which are full of pin joints) because of the square-cube law. Basically, as you increase in size, your pin is going to have its cross-sectional surface area squared, but the mass acting on it is going to be cubed. This kind of exponential imbalance is going to start shearing your pin before you get above house cat size. 

To be hypnotized, you must let yourself be hypnotized. Which means you can't hypnotize an unwilling participant. Someone being hypnotized is more susceptible to suggestion, but no one can be forced to do something they categorically would not do. This is why hypnosis is most often used for two purposes: 

The same way you crash any market: corner it. Let's cut to the chase: assuming every Bitcoin is worth 17,000 USD (which it hit recently), there's only 280 billion USD worth of Bitcoin, total, right now. Since the number of Bitcoins is capped at 21 million, there's only 357 billion USD worth of Bitcoin possible (still assuming 17,000 USD for a single Bitcoin). Even now, Bitcoin is only worth so much because it's the "hot new" investment thing, and most real transactions with it are illegal transactions where anonymity and untraceability are key. Most of the rest of Bitcoin is held by "investors" who are riding its wave of popularity, and miners who have "created" the Bitcoins and are looking to turn them into usable currency. This creates a serious problem for Bitcoin: without the ability of normal people to make normal transactions with Bitcoin, it will never have enough staying power to maintain a stable level of worth. As investors realize only criminals are using the currency as currency, the investors will start pulling out, which will likely cause the worth of the currency to crash. So the question is, how do your financial institutions reduce Bitcoin's ability to be used as a currency? They can stage a hostile takeover of Bitcoin and just sit on it. We're talking about a currency with no intrinsic value. That means that it's only as useful as its purchasing power, and stockpiling it inflates its worth in the short-term, but reduces its purchasing usefulness in the long-term. Merchants don't like accepting unstable currency. You can't plan your financial forecast if the money coming in is suddenly worth 1% of what it was yesterday, and tomorrow will be worth 1,000%. By destabilizing the currency by buying it all up, your financial institutions can scare away merchants from accepting the currency. As the purchasing ability of Bitcoin drops, so will its price, and you can buy a bunch more, riding this cycle until Bitcoin completely crashes. 

You can pretty much think of emotional states as finite state machines with n! states, and n is at least 100. Ultimately, the problem is that you can, while feeling one already complex emotion, simultaneously feel another extremely complex emotion. This layering can happen n - levels deep. So, not only can you have happy at a friend's wedding vs happy at the funeral of a friend who's no longer battling cancer and is free from pain (as @Green mentioned), but you can simultaneously feel guilty at feeling happy, and feel the pressure of responsibility from your own family, and feel... etc. etc. etc.. So, to be able to describe an emotional state, you can't simply use an IPA-like dictionary to map emotional state-to-words, what you need is the building blocks to be able to compose multiple emotional states which are then composable with each other. At which point, what you're asking for is an international language standard. Welcome to Esperanto. 

Bananas. Edible bananas come from the "female" flowers, which do not need to be pollinated to produce fruit. But, this still means that you can't produce banana seeds, so if you want new banana trees you'll have to take a cutting from an existing tree or import seeds from somewhere else. Strawberry plants send out tendrils that can go into the ground and grow into new (genetically identical) plants. But this is largely useless for food; strawberry flowers need to be pollinated to produce strawberries. So you can have the plant, but not the fruit. Aspen trees. The largest living organism on Earth is an aspen grove in Colorado named Pando. Pando continually sprouts new trees from the roots of existing trees. An individual tree tends to live about a hundred years, but the trees are continually sprouting new trees out of the roots to replace them. Potatoes (and other root vegetables). Potato plants can sprout from potatoes. This will probably be the primary food source for your people. 

No, Roman concrete and asphalt are not the same thing. No, rubber is not a suitable replacement for bitumen in asphalt roads. However... The Romans were famous for building roads, and asphalt concrete is great for roads. Asphalt is also useful for coating concrete structures to provide a degree of waterproofing (asphalt shingles being probably the most popular roofing material--in the USA, at least). So the question becomes, could the Romans utilize asphalt to create roads and as a water-proofing pitch? And, if so, what role could rubber play? We know the Romans had access to bitumen (the pitch/binding agent in asphalt concrete). The Egyptians used bitumen as a mummifying agent which they harvested from the Dead Sea. The Romans' name for the Dead Sea? Palus Asphaltites (Asphalt Lake). Now we're getting somewhere... So, the Romans had access to bitumen/asphalt and undoubtedly knew of its water-proofing properties. The problem is, it's hard to acquire in the kinds of significant quantities you'd need to build a few thousand miles of roads or roof a few thousand buildings without modern oil-drilling equipment. It wasn't in widespread use as a ship caulking agent until the 1400s for this very reason. What to do? Enter rubber Rubber, on its own, does not provide a suitable pitch-like binding agent for asphalt concrete. However, rubber has been mixed into asphalt concrete for 170 years. This increases the durability/longevity of the road and provides a partial replacement for bitumen. So, while you can't entirely get rid of your dependence on bitumen, you can significantly reduce your dependence on it by substituting rubber for some of it, and also it provides a longer-lasting material. 

Learned behavior The starting point for these dreads is going to be the "hedgehog" spines, which start sprouting naturally during fox puberty (and continue with age). From an evolutionary standpoint, these began simply as a mating display (though we've obviously moved beyond that now). Some foxes began "cheating" with the size of their spines by grooming dreads on top of the spines to make them appear bigger, and these foxes had more successful mating displays. Now, that "cheating" is a required part of the foxes' lives. Ultimately, the grooming of the dreads is entirely a learned behavior that is now inextricably embedded in the foxes' evolutionary patterns, much like mating dances, mating calls, and nest building in other animals. 

More importantly, with personal shields it would take fewer soldiers to win a victory, which means you can split your force and get two victories, steamrolling your enemy before they have a chance to react. My point is, shields would be deployed strategically and specifically for certain operations. They would not be used in the same manner as a gun where every soldier gets one. Examples:
