Music is often played at sports events. In North America, music is regularly played in MLB, NHL, and NBA games. However, only in basketball games music is played while the game is in live action. In the NHL music is usually played during breaks and before the puck drops, and in the MLB it's in between the innings or during the few seconds a new batter steps in to the box; the game is not in play in any of those events. The only other time you might here music is during chants - for the purpose of this question let's ignore that as music. So why is it that music is played in NBA arenas during live ball? Wouldn't music be a source of distraction to the players? 

Percentage of each of the above categories is how often that category was part of double doubles. Of course a complete answer would have the same kind of percentage breakdown for all double types. 

What are the odds of seeing at least one grand slam for any MLB baseball game? That is if I go to a baseball game what is the percentage chance (expected value) I'll witness a grand slam? 

I'd like to know how many times a bunt resulted in a home run. The home runs can be out of the park (highly unlikely to have happened) or inside the park home runs cause by one or more errors. In addition, please provide the name of the hitter and the date of the event. If this can't be searched for the entirety of MLB's history, go back as far as possible. I can edit the question to ask for a reasonable period of time. 

NFL teams usually have their team logo painted in the middle of their home field, spanning 5 yards to the left and to the right of the 50 yard line. I've noticed that some stadiums are missing the logo and instead have the NFL logo printed at the center of the field. Carolina Panther's Band of America Stadium and and New Jersey's Metlife Stadium are 2 examples. The latter hosts both the New York Jets and New York Giants. Since 2 teams play at Metlife Stadium I'm assuming the NFL logo is used to keep the field neutral. Which NFL stadiums have the NFL logo at the center, and what's the reason behind this? 

In (at least) North America it's a tradition to induct the very best players of a league who have not been playing for a certain amount of years. All major leagues in North America: NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL practice this tradition. Almost all of the athletes who make it to the Hall of Fame have long careers. Furthermore, most these athletes retire either because of injuries and health reasons, or because they pass their prime and are no longer as effective as they used to be. In both these cases, it is improbable for these players to come out of retirement after the minimum inactive period required by their respective league to become eligible for Hall of Fame. This makes it even harder for a Hall of Famer to make a comeback, and frankly I can't think of any player who has done this in recent years. The only players who I think could possibly do this (but don't believe they'll do) are Chris Pronger, and maybe Brett Favre. Can a player who's been inducted to the Hall of Fame come out of retirement and start playing in that league again? I personally don't see why the leagues would have problem with this, but if it happens what is the policy of the leagues cited above regarding this situation. Will the athlete's Hall of Fame status be suspended for the time he continues to play? 

Although having the ball in the beginning of the second half means you'd have at least as many drives as the other team, you can't really translate a possession to points. Your question really depends on the game. For example, if the game is happening in poor weather conditions, then having the ball doesn't increase a team's chances of winning much. They just need to make efficient drives. Or if the game has been very defensively dominant by both teams, you can argue that having the ball one more time than your opponent does not give you an edge. After all, games are won by points and nothing else matters as much. A team could win with less time of possession given they are more efficient offensively and can create turnovers defensively. 

Players set off to play in groups everyday. At each hole the partners in a groups tee off and then continue to hit their ball until they make it to the hole. At each hole, which player tees of first? Once they've all teed, who goes next? Also when can a player hit the ball consecutively without others doing so? 

Tennis world number ones are usually grand slam champions, Roger Federer, Serina Williams, and Andy Murray are a few examples. But it's possible for a player to become the top seed by collecting points making deep runs in the grand slams and winning non major titles. Has there been a time when a man or a woman reached singles first seed before ever winning a major? If so please list them all, also did they to win a grand slam afterwards? 

Dustin Byfugling and Jacob Trouba of the Winnipeg Jets scored back to back goals against the Nashville Predators in 18 seconds in game 3 of second round of 2017-2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs. This is some of the fastest pairs of goals, but what's impressive about them is that both players play defence. What are the fastest back to back goals in the NHL in the regular and the postseason? Please include the name of the scorers, the date, opponent and the final score. 

The Patriots drove to Eagles' 8 yard line. After the snap, the ball is placed 8 yards behind the line of scrimmage for the kick attempt. This means that the ball was on the 16 yard line on the field goal attempt. The attempt was a miss and inside the red zone (20 yard line), Philadelphia gets the ball on their 20 yard line. As for your comment on the question, the end zone is 10 yards deep and is added to the line the ball is kicked from to measure the length of the field goal attempt. So Stephen Gostkowski had a 10 + 16 = 26 yards attempt. 

On August 15 2017 Giancarlo Stanton hit a homerun for a 6th straight games. This has made me to know the followings 

Alexander Ovechkin, captain of the Washington Capitals scored 2 seconds in the power play, late in the first period of game 1 of Eastern Conference finals of the 2017-2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. What are the fastest power play goals ever scored in the regular season and postseason in the history of the NHL? 

How many times in the history of the MLB, a starting pitcher stuck out all 9 starting hitters of the opposing team at least once in a game? 

During NFL games the commentators often talk about the play design. One thing that comes up a lot is the formation at the time of snap and quarterback's play readability. The quarterback could be under the centre and pick up the football from his centre. Or he could be standing few feet behind him and catch the ball out of the shotgun. The commentators also mention how rookie QBs are not used to playing under the centre and that some of the struggle to transit from almost always playing out of the shotgun. So I'm interested to know what are the strategical and performance differences of these configurations? 

The Cleveland Cavaliers have reached the 2017 - 2018 NBA finals. This is LeBron James' 8th consecutive trip to the finals, from 2011 to 2014 with the Miami Heats, and 2015 to 2018 with the Cleveland Cavaliers. What is the record for the most consecutive NBA finals appearances for a single player? I remember when LeBron made it to the finals in 2017 he tied a number of Celtics players from the 70s or 80s who had made it to the finals 7 years in a row. 

I'm wondering how much protection NHL referees wear aside the helmet. I've seen referees that had to either leave game or where on ice for a long time after getting hit or falling awkwardly. Those incidences have made me believe that the referees wear considerably less padding than the players. 

as the top five worst NFL teams in a single season. It also provides some stats and facts explaining why they belong to this list.
