Your description is rather vague, I can't even tell if the pain points to a problem with a muscle or with connective tissue (like the mentioned tennis elbow). One thing I do remember Pavel emphasize is that when you catch the kettlebell in a ballistic movement (like the lowest point of swings, cleans or snatches), you should do it with the arm fully extended (triceps flexed), or you might hurt your elbow. I usually have slight elbow-pain* when I take a long break from kettlebells and then start again. I then take it a little easy (especially with snatches), and it goes away. Something seems to need time to adapt. *haha, I'm just as vague 

Two exercises from the school on short and intense cardio requiring just you and the floor: Burpees Mountain Climbers It's usually best to do intense cardio in intervals, meaning many short sets with short breaks between them, like sets of 20 seconds with 10 seconds of rest in between (Tabata), sets of 30 seconds with 30 to 60 seconds of rest, or something of the sort. I would start (or at least try them) right now. If your muscles aren't prepared for this and you can't do more than two minutes, you won't be able to get much cardio out of it. 

You have a kettlebell. For god's sake, swing it! Some people call the kettlebell swing the king of exercises, and not without reason. When it comes to packing a good training for almost your whole posterior chain (interested in a strong back and buttocks of steel?) and some high-intensity cardio into a short time-frame, the kettlebell swing is without equal. Since your current workout kind of neglects your posterior chain, swings would make an excellent addition. A word of caution: The kettlbell swing, as most free weight exercises, requires proper form to be safe. Specifically, you need to keep your back straight. You can't strengthen the back without, well, without using it. While incorrectly performed swings could hurt your back, the benefits of proper swings for the back far outweigh the risks. Also, with just 16Kg you have some margin for error. You're not deadlifting 400 pounds. Instructions are abundant on youtube. $URL$ 

Yes, it is safe for the long term and no problem for you heart or joints, see Why your workout should be high-intensity. Regarding injuries in general, see the study of 300 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This group is more sensitive than healthy people to damage of the large joints. After two years of study, there was no damage. On a personal level, I have been doing high intensity workouts about once a week since the age of 11. My experience is that injuries of joints and/or heart failures occur when you do it in a "no pain - no gain" context, i.e. team sports or races. However, before starting a high intensity program, do a health check up and start with small, short doses. 

I did a quick read through of the search "eating nuts health risk" at Google Scholar at limited the search to 2012 and later, see $URL$ It does not seem to be any health risks. A search for "eating nuts gaining weight" on the same source, see $URL$ and a quick reading of the abstracts shows some result that seem to contradict that nuts are especially effective for weight gain. 10-12 years ago when I was overweight (BMI>26), the main cause was a high consumption of protein shakes and too little exercise. My idea behind the shakes was to reduce stress and I read in a book about stress that high intake of proteins would reduce stress hormones. 

Yes, it is ok. According to some research, e.g. NY Times- 4 minute workout once a week of 4 minutes high intensity training is enough to improve. Similar as Mosley of BBC recommends. My own experience is that if you fill the high intensity training sessions with full body exercises that engage all of your posterior chain, (e.g. burpees or kettlebell swings) you will also improve/sustain your strength. This way the other workouts can be focused on improving specific skills, e.g. swimming, running, or team sports such as football, basketball, etc. 

Various warm up drills for swimming that are integrated in a swim workout can be found at - for example - Swim work out generator 

On top of compound exercises like deadlifts (particularly the stiff-legged variety, if you're flexible enough) and squats (if you're flexible enough to do them right), glute-ham raises are an excellent way to target the hamstrings. 

As for Olive Oil, these workoutmasters are probably wrong, though. Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fats, and while it does contain Omega-6 polyunsaturated fats, it is relatively low in them. This makes it the good kind of vegetable oil. I've never seen anything pointing to monounsaturated fats being bad. Looking beyond the macro, good olive oil contains some mighty beneficial micronutrients like polyphenols. $URL$ 

That machine is called a barbell and you need to deadlift it. Deadlifting is not something you can start doing without learning it first, like you might with a machine. But no machine can teach to how to lift heavy weights without screwing up your back, learning how to deadlift will teach you exactly that. Find yourself a powerlifter or trainer at your gym, have them show you how the deadlift works, and let them check and correct your form. The basics are easy enough to learn though, you can do that from a book or online. Of course, you can deadlift anything you want, like kettlebells, instead of barbells. The farmers walk would be a great complementary exercise to the deadlift for your purposes. 

A Zeo or visiting a sleep lab could help you measure the quality of your sleep and pinpoint problems. Also, try to wake up properly. This will make it much easier to go to sleep later, and subsequently improve the quality of your sleep. 

If you have nothing to pull yourself up to, the next best thing is rowing. The two most practical kinds of rows without a gym are: inverted rows which can be done under a table 

The best source I know is red palm oil. (note that red = raw and unrefined, and that palm kernel oil is something else altogether) Raw palm oil not contains plenty of carotenes and lycopene, but also about 0.4 mg of tocotrienols plus a similar amount of alpha-tocopherol per 1 g of oil. Wheat germ oil is also rich in tocotrienols, and contains a lot more tocopherols, but is a lot less stable, resulting in a rather short shelf life. PS: Vitamin E is a class of 8 substances, namely alpha- through delta-tocopherol and alpha- through delta tocotrienol. Most supplements contain only alpha-tocopherol, converted from a natural mix of tocopherols by a process called methylation. Reseach suggests however, that mixed tocopherols and/or tocotrienols work a lot better than one isolated tocopherol, and that overly high dosages of alpha-tocopherol are unhealty. Tocotrienols are more potent than tocopherols. 

My advice would be to continue. If you have a normal life with all sorts of commitments, you your are bound to miss work-outs and not follow all dietary advice during the 60 days that the program prescribes. This shouldn't matter for a robust work-out routine. Also, given that Beachbody's "go to market" model is based on "multi-level marketing", see Wikipedia Beachbody and Wikipedia Multi-level marketing, you should have a critical view of all the material on the net regarding the result after program. 

*Female Medley Swimmers - BMI as a function of Height (BMI = 51.4-17.4*Height (in meters))* All of them (and most of the others I checked) do seem to be taller than you so that can be an argument against just comparing the BMI. However, the datapoint of, for example, Yasuko shows that it is possible to compete & win without being above average height. For you, BMI 23 means 60-61 kg. 

As you can see, I have assumed that last 5 exercises up to December 6 where of different effort and different lengths. Effort in Firstbeat is measured in Training effect. Then the system recommends a workout for December 7, rest day for December 8, a light workout for the 9th etc. In the bottom right corner, you can see how the system gradually increases the weekly EPOC load, through a mix of easy, hard exercises and workout length. Your optimal effort per week is then to be in the "grey" zone of the diagram in the bottom right. I have used the system for about 5 years now, for all my workouts (resistance training, yoga and swimming). It has helped me to avoid training too hard. 

As a complement to the Turkish getup (excellent answer), I would say 3-5 yoga sun salutations A. No equipment at all and will activate the posterior chain. Great as a morning routine. 

and to capture the actual workout through taking pictures of the index card or similar (see a picture of notes from a swim workout) and combining the two in a system like Evernote. This way I can analyze unlimited by the constraints of paper (e.g. moving averages is tedious when done manually) and still have the raw data for individual workouts available if needed. 

I can't name sources or studies, but I believe the warnings about dietary cholesterol are obsolete. Cholesterol in your diet has little effect on cholesterol in your blood. Other factors like carbs in your diet, exercise and your genes do have an effect, so a physically active person should have lower cholesterol. 

As for something completely different, your digestion can also cause your belly to produde. A bloated stomach is not flat. 

If I remember correctly, both MK4 and MK7 are types of Vitamin K2, whereas Kale would only contain K1, being a plant. As far as sources go, I believe plants contain K1, animal products (meat, eggs, dairy, grass-fed butter!) contain MK4 and bacteria produce MK7, which is therefor found in fermented food (Sauerkraut, Natto! Yoghurt... ). 

The whole saturated=bad thing appears to be old junk science. It appears now that monounsaturated fats are good, saturated fats are good when they come from high quality sources (most don't: grass-fed vs. grain-fed, hormones, antibiotics...), and that polyunsaturated fats are only healthy in small amounts. They tend to oxidize and go rancid. The short shelf-life is kind of a tell. Also, with polyunsaturated fats, there seems to be an imbalance: A Modern diet contains way too much Omega-6 and too little Omega-3. 

There are plenty of possible reasons, here are my two best guesses: No. 1 is an anterior pelvic tilt. Modern lifestyles with lots of sitting and shoes with heels lead to tight hip flexors, which lead to a tilted pelvis, a hollow back and a protruding belly. 

Other points: Other kettlebell exercises for the minimalist who is short on time are the clean&press, snatches and turkish get-ups. This combination was introduced by Pavel in his book Enter the Kettlebell (ETK). Particularly the clean&press is an excellent full body workout. Snatches and get-ups require a little more time to learn, but are well worth it if you want to make good use of your kettlebells. If you combine press-ups and overhead presses in the same workout, you will have to reduce intensity, as there is quite a bit of overlap in the muscles they use. You could do them on different days. As for getting ripped, that requires you to get your body-fat pretty low, and that is mostly down to nutrition. Your pre-workout snack isn't really a great start, although you might get away with it if you have good genes. You don't need that much muscle to be ripped, if you push yourself a little (but not too much) the described workout should easily cover that. If you compress rest periods between exercises, you can some pretty intense cardio out of a workout like this. The other technique is to first do everything else, and then finish a workout with a few minutes kettlebell-swings (or snatches), as these are done at a relatively hign number of repetitions and are really good cardio on their own.
