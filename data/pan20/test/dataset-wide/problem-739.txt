If you still have the old tire, then the easiest method is to check the markings on the tire. But if you don't, then you have to measure the rim's bead seat diameter (see illustration). Here are the most common sizes: 

The instructions that you quoted are what we call "covering one's ass". Don't let them intimidate you into spending more $ than you need to. Just get a razor blade and scrape it off. You'd have to dig into it pretty hard to cause any problems, especially on a steel frame. 

Replacing a spoke is easy. Truing the wheel (that is, getting it straight) is harder - but it's a skill worth learning. If you want to learn, buy a new spoke and a spoke wrench; if you're pressed for time, have the shop fix it. Either way, there's no need to replace the wheel. 

Bike shorts. If you ride more than 20 miles at a time, they'll definitely make your ass happier. Gloves. Indexed shifting system (your bike is from the early 90s, so I assume you don't have one). You'll have to replace most of the drivetrain, so plan the job before you start and figure out if it's worth the cost. Shoes and clip-in pedals. It's not just about keeping your foot in place - the stiff sole makes for more efficient power transfer from your legs to the cranks. If you also plan to ride your bike in regular shoes, I recommend something like Shimano M424 pedals. 

No, that's not fixable. To measure the steering tube length accurately, you have to remove the fork. You could get an approximate measure without removing it, but you have to remove it anyway, so might as well do it now. Once it's out, it's pretty self-explanatory - just measure the length of the tube from the point where it joins the fork crown. The tube on the replacement fork has to be at least as long as the one you have now. If it's longer, you'll have to cut it, but if it's too short, there's nothing you can do. I assume that the "140 mm" refers to the suspension travel. If the travel (or, more precisely, the axle-to-crown distance) is different on the replacement fork, it'll affect the handling, so try to keep it close. 10 mm in either direction shouldn't make much difference. It looks like you have a thru-axle. Make sure the new fork is compatible with the axle style you have. There are different styles of brake caliper attachment - but you can get adapters for those. You also have to pay attention to the steering tube diameter, but it looks like you covered that already. 

Lift the bike so one wheel is off the ground and spin the wheel. Look at the rim where it meets the brakes, and see how much it wobbles. Ideally, the wheel should be perfectly round, but this is pretty rare on used bikes. Deviation of 2 mm or less is pretty good; 5 mm means it should get fixed; 15 mm means it's beyond fixing, and the wheels are garbage. (This assumes the bike has rim brakes; with disk brakes, the tolerances are a little more generous.) Check for loose spokes. Grab a spoke between two fingers and gently shake it - if it's installed properly, it shouldn't move at all, if it feels like it's not firmly attached, then you have a problem. Check the tires. Worn-down tread is not necessarily a problem (unlike car tires), but watch out for cracked, brittle-looking rubber. 

Get another Lefty with longer travel. And I don't think they sell those separately, so that's probably impossible. Get a normal fork. And this will means replacing the parts that are designed to work with the Lefty: the front wheel, the stem, and the headset (you'll have to get a special reducer headset to make it fit in the over-sized headtube.) This is definitely doable, but you'll be better off just buying another bike. 

There are ways to deal with this situation - none of them are very good. Which means that the best thing to do is to make sure you don't go there in the first place. If you maintain your brakes, and don't ride some horrible P.O.S. Walmart bike, then the chances of losing both brakes at the same time are very slim. 

Try sitting on the bike while supporting yourself against a wall, then look down to see if anything is shifting under your weight. Or better yet, have someone else look. Check the axle nuts (or quick-release levers, depending on what you have) and make sure they're all tight. 

If one side screws in without problems, and you've verified the thread orientation, then it's not a compatibility problem. ( $URL$ - scroll down to "bottom bracket threading".) Trying to gently tighten it with a wrench should be fine. If you encounter abnormal resistance, then you should start thinking about taking it to a shop for chasing. 

According to this article, the last Tour De France win on an aluminum frame (a Bianchi ridden by Marco Pantani) was 1998. It also says that the last TDF win on a steel bike was 1994. It's interesting that aluminum had such a brief run. 

I assume the "29" refers to the wheel size (29 inch, a.k.a. 700c, 622 ISO, or 28 inch), but check what it says on your tires, just to be sure. See here for more information about tire sizes than you ever wanted. This is probably the most common size out there, so you'll have no trouble finding tires. If you only ride on pavement, then yeah, road tires are a good idea. You'll need new tubes as well, since the tires will be skinnier. 3 months is a really short lifespan for a tire. You probably just got the batch from that day when all the guys at the tire factory were hung over. So I wouldn't trust the front tire, either - replace that, too. 

Could be specific materials, like different grades of Aluminum in a back plate or alloy vs steel backing, Kool Stop makes ones that have cooling "fins" on the back of them that help shed heat off the pads. Otherwise, some of it could be in getting a name brand pad vs a smaller manufacturer or rebranded Chinese knockoff. 

One fair warning to add to the previous answer. The "C" models from Shimano were Rapid Rise. They don't make this system any more, but it means the cable pull is reversed and when you change this out for a non-rapid rise rear derailleur the shifters will read backwards. This means when they say they are in 8th speed, they will actually be in 1st, and vice versa. Non-rapid rise derailleurs are otherwise compatible with rapid rise shifters, and the shift points should all match up and work fine. If you want the shifters to read correctly, you should change the shifters too. 

Looks like you may not be closing your Quick Releases quite tight enough, and they are causing the wear. Here's a Park Tool blog post about it: Wheel installation 

Looks like a lower-end, Department Store-quality BMX bike of indeterminate age and brand. It's probably been repainted, doesn't have a head badge or any stickers, I just don't see any way to identify it at all. I know it's a low end one because of the stamped kickstand mounting plate, any nicer bike wouldn't have that. I would go ahead and build it anyways if you like the frame, and ride it well. 

I'm not sure there is a real reason to make a kickstand just for steel frames, except what you mentioned about carbon. The only thing I can think of is maybe the one "for steel frames" has a steel plate where it interfaces with the frame, and they are trying to keep galvanic corrosion away... 

I believe it is safe, as the brake's actuation isn't predicated on a flush mounting surface. The problems you are likely to run into are: 

To start with, it's almost impossible to over grease a BB. It could literally be packed in grease and would work just fine. Too much may slow it down a tiny bit, but really, riding it you wouldn't notice. Grease is simply too viscous to cause a lot of friction. It's much more likely it's over tightened or has damaged bearings. Also, with some cheap sealed bearings there could be a short "wear-in" period during which it may not spin freely, but will act looser over time. Depending on the type of Bottom Bracket, you really could be having any number of smaller problems, but I would start with bearing tension(if it's a loose ball BB), or feel if the bearings themselves spin freely without the crank spindle installed(if it's a sealed system). Or if the spindle spins smoothly(if it's a cartridge like a square taper or Splined), and go from there. 

That may very well be Chicago. Here is a guide to the different badges they used: $URL$ As I remember, the biggest giveaway was if the badge was affixed with machine screws, it was from Chicago. If it uses rivets, it's overseas. Oh, and 1982 was the last Chicago Schwinn. So if that one is 1983, you missed it by a year. 

Skipping like that is usually worn cassette, chain or chainring(or all 3). Considering it's only doing it in the highest gears, my first guess would have been the cassette. But since it's only a month old, it's much more likely to be the derailleur is mis-aligned just a little bit. You say the derailleur is "ever so slightly bent", that little bit can make a big difference if it's out of alignment with the gears. Also, as Criggie says in the comments, the cables "settle in" a little after about a month or 2 of riding, that's very common, and the reason most shops offer a free tuneup in the first year you own a new bike. May be worth checking to see if the shop you got it from offers one. 

In comments, I see you stated it is a Truvativ Crank... The description of your problem sounds like it may be a couple problems. If the bearings in the BB are worn out, it may make any kind of "clunky" feel. But what it sounds like to me is it was ridden with crank pinch bolts loose for a bit and the BB/Crankarm interface might be worn down one way or the other. It's entirely possible you may need to change out either. You said you took it to a shop, may be worth getting a 2nd opinion if you weren't happy with their answer. And this time, ask them to show you what's wrong. As a mechanic, I was never against showing people, "Here's the wear, this is why we recommend changing this". But be aware that at that point, the shop has invested time and money(in employee wages) in that repair. Don't get the answer from the shop, then do the work yourself. No shame in supporting your local shop when you can't diagnose a problem yourself. 

It being an "unbranded crankset", I don't think anyone here could tell you that. May be a good idea to change it anyways, as usually complete bikes are specced with the cheapest compatible BB, and as that is one of the prime spinning parts of your bike, upgrading it even a little usually goes a long way.
