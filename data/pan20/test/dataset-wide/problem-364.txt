Well actually a 32,000 mph orbital speed means that the radius of the orbit of the earth around Jupiter is around 621 000km, which is less than the Roche Limit of Jupiter 900 000km. So the Earth gets crushed into pieces. The moon probably too. 

As pointed out by other answers, a big incentive to invent things is to make money, which would be problematic in the world that you describe. So how do you pay those inventors? Well one thing is that many thing that we pay today would be free, so people actually have a lot more money than today. I don't think however that people would be willing to give the same amount of money to things like kickstarter/patreon/charity/... as what they pay today. On way to force them into giving more money would be taxes. This already exists in some countries (cf. Wikipedia), where public broadcasters rely on tax-money for their funding (as opposed to ads). That however wouldn't necessarily suppress the existence of independent productions. For example in France a lot of movies are financed through what is called "l'avance sur recette" (sorry, I could not find a good reference in english). Basically a commission reviews the film project before-hand and tries to guess how much money it is going to make. They then give money, and if the film is actually successful enough, the commission gets its money back. [This is not exactly a loan since sometimes the money is never payed back.] You could adapt such a system by evaluating the movie depending on how much success it is going to have rather than how much money it is going to make. Here I have been talking about cultural stuff, but I guess you could adapt this to about anything. [Note that depending on where you live, the right-wing could think that all this is a really bad idea...] 

Generally, you should use lesser detail on your map, the further you "zoom out". There is no point in marking every little village on a world map as it would get confusing. Again, look at google maps, they show and hide routes, villages etc. when you change the zoom. 

might point to better results. I am by no means a biologist, and I have little knowledge as of how such Isotopes affect the Immunesystem of the creature, so another approach that might work by the same principle - and is surely more fun for the subject - is getting it drunk and measuring the degree of blood alcohol decreasing. However, this presumes that the scientists have knowledge over the alcohol breakdown process for the species without having it timejumping. Maybe a monitored measurement first? 

The spherical planet is projected on a plane by slightly distorting the proportions. Displaying coordinates makes the effect more visible: 

injecting a sample of the isotope getting a blood sample waiting a few days taking another blood sample and comparing the results with the expected value 

Image source: $URL$ A Napalm bombs area of effect is somewhere between 2500 sqft 2 and 20000 sqft 3. So to completely cover the entirety of Madagaskar (6,318415e+12 sqft) you'd need quite a few of these (or really big ones). But if you target highly flammable areas like forests, the area of effect of the bomb will highly increase due to the fire spreading widely, leading to massive forest fires scorching wide areas of the land. Note that the use of Napalm against civilian targets is prohibited, but I don't think the Rat Empire cares about such restrictions. They are Part of human law and not Rat law after all. 

Well according to wikipedia, the first microscope was made between the 1200's and 1600, so actually the middle ages are not that far off. You can also look at this page $URL$ which links to the book [*], which may probably answer all of your questions. About the fact of finding germs, it is said once again on wikipedia that the first bacteria was found in the 1600s thanks to a "single-lens microscope". So I assume that as soon as you have a basic microscope and that you look in the right direction, you can actually find germs. [*]: Bardell, D. 2004. “The Invention of the Microscope”. 

Well the strange thing is that we already have genes in common with about anything. Here are some examples: 

I'll assume that the time machine can be used multiple times: Step 1: Get some attention. Go to the pentagon, try to break the security and fail. This way some official people will hear what you have to say. Step 2: Threaten them: "In 4 hours a bomb is gonna explode at some precise place." This place will be heavily watched after this. Step 3: Send something from the future at this precise place and time. It can be anything, the important thing is that people see that an object has appeared out of thin air. From here on out, people should listen to you a lot more. 

Could I have some info on what would be realistic ranges for EMPs from nuclear bombs of different yields? I'm unclear about that. Of course it depends on altitude and blast yield, and some electronics can take more than others, but just in general what area would it affect? 

Maybe this question doesn't go too far, but when reading about liquid metal type materials like those that can harden with electricity or magnetism, I was kind of thinking of something there. For those who have read through stuff about developments in smart materials, is there a known material that could be made to harden and flatten like some kind of shield or harden and extend to a sharp point? 

The whole concept of higher dimensions has always been a fascinating one, but I have to ask if anyone has found anything, like a popular science article or something, that suggests a useful way of interacting with them. One of the big problems with the idea of interacting with them or going to them is that doing so suggests a loss of energy from our dimension. At this point, there isn't any evidence of energy being literally lost from the universe as far as I know (discounting any zero point energy stuff). There is the suggestion that black holes could exist in higher dimensions or that dark matter could, but other than that there isn't much. The only way that I've heard about for going to other dimensions is by using an extremely huge amount of energy like the energy in particle accelerators. Is there any lower energy way someone or something could interact with a higher dimension that has some science behind it? 

One way would be to use suction pads. The problem is that suction pads use air pressure in order to work, so they do not work in a vacuum. That means that you cannot attach a suction pad on the outside of a spaceship. However you can attach it inside, in order to create an airlock. Here is how it would work: 

A quick google search lets you find even more results. So in a sense, we already are hybrids. Note that is not just us: any two species have genes in common. There are two reasons for that: one is that we all share a common ancestor. The other is that horizontal gene transfer seems to be a thing. 

I'm not sure if this is a complete answer but here is my 2-cent: The first thing to note is that the problem isn't really if a Man can grasp a 3-dimensional situation, but if he can deal with it better than an AI. That heavily depends on how advanced AI are. The second one is that you could have multiple men in one space fighter to deal with some shortcommings, a bit like un the B52. 

In Sci-fi, space fighters often look like exotic versions of fighter jets: wing shape is often different but the general shape is most of the time kept. However this seems unrealistic: the shape of fighter jets is almost always the same, because it is optimised for air-combat. In particular wings serve no purpose at all in space. What would a realistic space fighter look like? In terms of technology, I would like to stay as close as possible to what is possible today. 

I am a huge Minecraft fan and just realized, this hasn't been asked before, so I wanted to ask a live-long (31. August 2009) question, and pay my obulus to the Anatomically Correct series. I have done some research, and found this picture: 

This way you can create a map with all major parts of your world, like bigger continents and oceans. By using different colors you can either show different political factions or countries (have a look at the first image again) or you can document different biomes (simply have a look at google maps for this one). With your major parts of the world are mapped out, you can easily add rivers and bigger lakes to the map. Visualizing mountain ranges or forests can be done by using either shading, like in the first picture, or by placing little icons like trees or single mountains on your map: 

I think @Quentins answer of using a radio transmitter is a good approach. However, having a technical device stuck to your species might not work, depending on the details of your timetraveling process. Who knows, whether only the species travels and the device remains untouched? Further, the device probably has some issues due to its size just like he already pointed out. I would probably go for a more cemical/biological approach: The possible timetravelling subject could be injected with a small amount of radioactive material with a high rate of decay, for example that has a half-life rate of . So, 

This is an interesting sort of weapon concept I thought of. I imagine it to be useful for remotely causing pain to someone in an area. Essentially, you'd have police or maybe drones spray or apply by some means nanoparticles to someone, which would either sit on someone's skin or perhaps penetrate some distance, while remaining in the skin. They would absorb radiation such as microwaves, which would allow them to heat up remotely. That way, a strong microwave field would cause, say protesters to be burned while others around the emitter would be mostly unharmed. Microwaves do interact with human tissue, so perhaps if the nanoparticles could absorb/attenuate radio raves, that would work better. I suppose that one issue that occurs to me is that maybe the power needed to remotely heat up the particles might automatically fry any electronics in the area. Although maybe a dish could be used to focus the radiation a limited amount? To the extent that it wouldn't harm people without the spray. Thoughts on the plausibility of this? 

This is sort of on the more realistic side of worldbuilding, but maybe somewhat exaggerated for the sake of a setting. What's the fastest atmospheric pressure drop in weather records? This question is kind of more asking how quickly a flash flood could happen, especially maybe a decade in a future. Of course, heavy rainfall contributes to that, but a storm surge caused by wind and pressure is what I'm interested in.
