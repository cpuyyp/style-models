Visijax make a high-visibility cycling jacket that also includes battery-powered indicators. It may be the way to go, at least in winter, if you don't mind looking like a bit of a prat. $URL$ 

I got a spare inner tube with my bike, which is good. I checked how it was packed and found it was sticking somewhat when I pulled it out of the box, which I can only imagine is bad. Would it be an idea to put someething on the tube for storage, talcum powder maybe? 

The clue's in the name. BIKE lane! If you see cars doing this, especially if you're being bullied by antisocial car drivers, I'd recommend taking notes of license plates and having a few friendly chats with the police. Realistically that probably wouldn't achieve much, but you never know. 

A quick search turned up this post, in which the OP is having the same trouble. It sounds like your crank is swaged to the chainrings, as in this image: 

From the pictures you've posted across a few different questions, I can almost guarantee you will not make money selling that bike, no matter what you do to it. At the very least you will need a new freewheel and chain, new tyres, cables, and brake pads. Sadly, those will probably set you back more than you could sell the bike for. Given your apparent lack of mechanical know-how, you really should leave the repairs to a professional mechanic, which will further add to the costs. I believe you underestimate the differences between your "junkie" bike and modern "fancy" bikes. Yes, you can buy the componentry found on "fancy" bikes separately, but most of it will be designed to fit modern frames, which more than likely have different diameter tubing. Although you should be able to find new parts to replace the knackered ones, they are unlikely to be of high quality. Whatever you do to that bike, it will still be heavy and cumbersome. One can't polish a turd, as they say. Modern, more expensive frames and components are generally lighter, stiffer, smoother, better-fitting, and better-looking... none of which are essential for getting around. If you don't have much of a budget, the best thing would be to find a local bike co-op and learn how to perform basic maintenance from volunteer mechanics. Otherwise, I'd donate that bike to such a project, and buy something a bit nicer second-hand. Or just get your LBS to do the bare minimum to make it rideable, ride it til it falls apart, then get a new one! 

Even though it should not come out easily, occasionally the brake boss will work its way loose. Sometimes you can fix this problem by screwing the whole thing back into the frame and tightening it a bit. Then when you unscrew it again the brake bolt rather than the brake boss will come free. If that happens your problem is solved! Make sure that the brake boss is secure and doesn't have play. That would suggest some damage may have caused the loosening. 

One possibility is that the other side is not sufficiently tightened. To me it looks like there is too much of the bolt showing on this side, which implies that it may not be able to be tightened completely on the other side. This may lead to slipping. The amount of protruding bolt on each side of the seat should be roughly the same. If you are uncertain take a picture of the other side as well. You may also want to check that the threads on the bolt are not damaged. If it was overtightened the threads may have been stripped, making it impossible to tighten. Otherwise, it could be wear to the clamp front surface as others have suggested. 

As far as I have been able to tell, there is no difference in terms of functionality or practicality. With many bicycle components, different manufacturers create their own standards purely to ensnare customers. All of the vintage brake levers I have seen use pear nipples, so I assume the barrel nipple came later, but I have no idea which manufacturer first designed a barrel-style lever. Personally I just find it an unnecessary annoyance... you can't really say one is used for road bikes and the other for MTBs... the bar end levers on my road bikes take "MTB"-style barrel nipples. Plus I have an older MTB with V-brakes that's fitted with crosstop levers - those take pear nipples. It's just a chore having to double-check before you go and buy new cables. Both kinds are trivial to install, and work just as well as each other once on the bike. Although one style may be more prone to mechanical failure than the other, I am sure that the points of failure for both are far beyond the serviceable life of the cable (i.e. it will have stretched, frayed, and rusted considerably by the time the nipple breaks off). Thankfully I've never seen a third kind. 

I used to cycle a lot, and decided to try taking it back up after last year's Olympics. But it feels like almost every time I try to go out for a ride I nearly get taken out by someone passing far too close and giving no warning. As I'm partially sighted this is particularly terrifying. I can spot things ahead of me with plenty of time to avoid nasty incidents if I keep my concentration up, but that leaves me less aware of what's going on behind me, and I can't see well enough to pick out number plates if I need to report someone. I also rely on hearing to detect cars coming up but when the traffic is heavier I can't pick out individual cars over the general background roar of traffic. I'm in a full time job and pay my taxes just like everyone else, I've every right to be on the road. But drivers, either through ignorance or malice are making me feel very unwelcome on the roads. The idea of quitting to me is galling because like I said, I have every right to be on the road, and I can see well enough to avoid getting into trouble provided the people coming up behind me don't act like morons. But I also don't want to end up dead. Have you got any advice for me? I live in the Greater Manchester area 

Aesthetically, it's just a case of keeping it clean. Use a toothbrush to clear accumulated dirt out of the little nooks and crannies, like the joints between tubes (especially around the bottom bracket). Waxing the frame can help keep that brand-new lustre. The back of the chainring and spider, sprockets, rear hub, and dropouts, can get grotty pretty quickly, so use a gentle degreaser to keep on top of it. Same for the chain. Use a brush to get all the little bits of road dirt out of the links, then, with a clean brush, apply oil liberally. Brush it right in there. Wipe off any excess afterwards. As far as the feeling of mechanical "newness" goes, a clean, well-oiled drivetrain is the biggest contributor IMO. Edit: Bike cleanliness pr0n 

My only worry is rotor clearance. If luck permits, you may be able to fine-tune that with some very narrow washers on the mounting bolts. Otherwise I say go for it. I've successfully converted a few bikes to different wheel sizes (27" to 700C, 700C to 650B, 26" to 700C, and 700C to 27") - admittedly none of these had disc brakes to worry about, but as long as you've got a handle on frame clearances and mudguards there isn't much that can't be worked out. Good luck! 

I have been looking around for information on this topic but can't find anything definitive. The tram routes through Manchester city centre are for trams (obviously), but it seems public transport can use the tramways as well. My understanding is that is legal for cyclists to use bus lanes, so does the same apply to the tram routes? I also seen people cycling on the tramways, but are they actually allowed to do so? Just because people are doing it doesn't make it legal after all, as plenty of people cycle on the pavements as well (which in Manchester is a special kind of stupidity given how busy the streets are!) Is there any official policy on the status of the tramways as cycle routes? I do know that Metrolink are rather hostile to cyclists, and I certainly wouldn't want to lose an argument to a tram whilst on a bike... 

I now realise "gran fondo" is American terminology for "cyclosportive". That sort of event falls loosely between audax and racing. The randonneuring community prize responsible riding, and tend to frown upon behaviour or equipment that could be deemed "antisocial". For example, most audax events require riders to fit mudguards, for the benefit of others. In "gran fondos", although riders may only be competing against their own personal goals, they may find themselves sharing the same stretch of road with others, and some participants may wish to treat the event as a private race. Steering control is severely compromised when using aero bars. They're not considered safe when riders may be racing in close proximity - a slight wobble could cause a major takedown. They're not great for cornering either. Hence the reason they're illegal in most events, except triathlon and time trials, where riders are mostly spread apart and riding fairly straight courses. 

If a chain gets sufficiently worn, it will start inflicting wear damage on the chainrings and sprockets (in extreme cases, causing the teeth to take on a hook shape). This wear will cause problems with gear changes and pedalling, and your only option at that point is an expensive replacement of a significant portion of the drive train (You'll probably need to replace the chainrings, sprockets and cassette, and possibly your deraileurs as well if you can't get parts compatible with the current ones). If you're lucky, your deraileurs just need tuning. Badly aligned deraileurs can cause all kinds of issues, but they should go away if you can sort the alignment out. There's a couple of adjustment screws you can use to calibrate the gear shift. Keeping your chain in good working order and replacing it quickly when it starts showing signs of wear is important, because chains are one of the cheapest parts of the drivetrain and can cause very expensive damage if worn or damaged chains aren't replaced quickly. 

I have managed to convert the bottom bracket to work with three piece cranks on my early 1970s UO-8. It originally had cottered cranks. All I had to do was find a square taper bottom bracket spindle that had roughly the same spacing with regard to the bearings as the original. I reused the bottom bracket cups and used loose bearings. I had problems with unthreading on the driveside bottom bracket cup (it's not reverse threaded) so I used thread locker. It works okay. The quality of the only spindle I found at a reasonable price was not great, so it's not the smoothest (there may also be a slight mismatch in the bearing surfaces). Any of the more specific modern cranksets will probably require one of the more expensive bottom brackets with interchangable cups, such as the Phil Wood. However, if you're considering an outboard bottom bracket you will need to think about whether you need to face the bottom bracket shell. I am only familiar with using the Park Tool bottom bracket tapping and facing set for this purpose, which normally is used to face the bottom bracket shell after tapping. Looking at available tools, it should be possible to face the bottom bracket shell with a headtube facing tool if you find it necessary to do so. 

The accepted answer fails to point out that skidding is less effective at slowing the bike than not skidding. To stop a brakeless fixie quickly, the rider must shift their weight backwards as far as possible (to help prevent loss of traction, as weight moves forwards under braking), while resisting the pedals' rotation as hard as they can, without locking up the rear wheel. Rolling friction > sliding friction. The heavier the rider, the more difficult it is to stop - there is more momentum to resist. Also, the longer the gearing, the less mechanical advantage your legs have to resist the pedals; again it is more difficult to stop. However, with manageable gearing (i.e. NOT track ratios!), and good leg muscles and technique, the limiting factor becomes tyre adhesion. Where I live there are hills on which I can only stop with brand-new racing tyres. Worn tyres or harder compounds just give up and skid!
