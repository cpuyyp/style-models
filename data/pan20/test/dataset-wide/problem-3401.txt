A dollar is a medium of exchange produced by the federal reserve at the federal government's behest. Like all fiat currency it has no intrinsic value, but is worth something because people agree it is. This is nothing unusual...currencies with little or no intrinsic value are historically common. Banks keep track of how many dollars people have given them (whether savers or investors) and what they have paid out, so they always know what their balance is and don't lend money they don't have. The thing that prevents them from claiming infinite money is the same thing that keeps me from claiming I have a million dollars under my mattress: it's fraud. If a bank was to lie about its balances, the bank's auditors and regulators would be happy to start throwing those responsible in jail and correcting the mistake. There is exactly one bank that can just change its balances or pay with dollars that it didn't acquire from others: the federal reserve. When the fed wants to buy something it doesn't have to worry about where the dollars come from: it just makes the dollars up electronically. This is why the fed can never go bankrupt. It doesn't have meaningful liabilities. Now, fractional banking increases the number of apparent dollars in the aggregate economy because any time someone deposits in a bank, the dollar is then lent out. Both the borrower and lender would say they have a dollar. But of course, this process results in a more-or-less constant multiplier of the apparent dollars, so it's not what causes inflation, nor is it anything strange or evil. 

If it was impossible to observe prices, we would probably see economists looking at the GDP and the supply and velocity of money to try and back out an estimate of what happened with prices. Essentially, P = MV/T Unfortunately, each of these variables is observable only with noise and not particularly quickly (For example, what was the dollar value of all transactions this month? Any answer will be a rough estimate). Moreover, the theory only works in the long run, as you mention. There are plenty of potentially confounding factors, some of which have been mentioned here, that would mess up the computation and introduce error. I think the short answer is that it is more accurate, cheaper, and more correct to observe price changes directly than to infer them from other, theoretically related, variables. 

They're complementary to each other. With the development of Behavioral Game Theory, canonized in Camerer's 2003 textbook, the current paradigm of game theory 1 is converging towards making theories about how people play games, and test them, most often with experiments.

Now about MSNE. A good way to start thinking about it is to take an arbitrary strategy and play around with it. You will find no MSNE this way. The other way to look for them is to find a point where two strategies make players indifferent between their options and are also best responses. I could only find this in the symmetric case. There are some MSNE if you play strategies $( a_1, a_2 )$ where $a_1+a_2 = 100$ and your mixing probabilities are $P(a_1) = a_1/a_2$ (assuming $a_1 < a_2)$. Example here would be playing $(10, 90)$ with probabilities $(11.111, 88.888)$. This makes the opponent indifferent between $10$ and $90$, and as such he could play the mirror strategy, with both being indifferent to any mixing and both being a best response to each other. I did not find any other case of MSNE, even after some work. 

Moreover, does it fulfill other criteria automatically, like Myerson's "Proper equilibrium" refinement? 

Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies. So your answer needs to give two strategies. The informal definition is "pair of strategies that are best responses to each other". So take an arbitrary strategy; let's say each player chooses 50. Can anyone gain by playing 51 or 49? No, so (50, 50) is a NE. Like your equation says, any two strategies that add up to 100 make up a PSNE. Because there can be no profitable deviation for any of the two player (the proof is trivial; show that playing less gives less, and that playing more, gives less for any pair of strategies adding up to 100) 

One extremely function throughout economics is the Cobb-Douglas functional form (eg. $y = bx_1^a x_2^b$). This won't just show up in utility functions, but also production functions or growth functions (like in the Solow Swan model). Taking the log-log form here has a few implications. First, it drops $a$ and $b$ from exponents to linear coefficients, which gives you a form $lny = b+alnx_1+blnx_2$. This is important, because you can run a linear regression on this functional form, but not the original one. You can see an example of that in this paper. It also has applications in empirical microeconomics; you can test to see if a firm has increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale if you find $a+b > or < 1$. This can have important implications; it can answer some questions like "should we break up these big companies?" Second it makes the math nicer in some cases. This can actually be useful in some cases; in Maximum likelihood estimation having a more mathematically friendly functional form can save you hours of computation time finding maxima. 

First, we should remember that the government did not particularly spend any money on the air strike, except for incidental stuff like fuel costs. It already owned those missiles, which were part of a previous government spending program. Unlike profit-motive organizations that try to be streamlined, the government buys many things it never uses and doesn't necessarily replace things it does use. This is particularly true of the military. The US military has enough stockpile to use incredible force in Syria and still not need to change its future spending. But anyway, let's talk about your question. Military is, indeed, an example of stimulus-style spending: a government program that employs people and creates demand across the economy, but which does not generate much in the way of goods and services that we would normally count as wealth. Engaging in war does increase employment and temporarily increase demand. To be clear, this should not be confused with helping the economy in the long-term. The Keynsian argument suggests stimulus spending as a way to smooth out short-term trends, but which must be paid for later. It's not a way to improve the economy overall. The wealth of a country is measured by the goods and services it produces (or can buy). Military spending can jump start an economy full of pessimism or in a bad equilibrium, but it clearly shifts resources and people away from wealth-building and is a long-term economic drag. Think of military spending as similar to hiring people to break rocks or farm weeds, as was done in earlier periods of our history. It increases employment and but does not add to the nation's overall wealth. In fact, you can think of military spending as a transfer payment from the wealthy (who pay most of the taxes) to those who benefit from military spending (weapons manufacturers and associated industries). As you mention, I'm not saying military spending is good, bad, immoral, or moral. Just saying economically it's a short-term stimulus, long term drag. 

When the Fed purchases something, it creates the money to do so out of thin air (it just changes the balance in a bank's Fed account. Click, click.). Similarly when the fed is paid, the dollars disappear. From the Fed's perspective, dollars are very ephemeral and not backed by anything. Dollars are not like debt. They don't entitle you to anything the Fed owns. The Fed can't "go under" in the normal sense of word (bankruptcy) because it has no obligations to repay or if it does, it creates the money to pay those obligations with no limitation. It goes under only by an act of law. It would be possible for the government to abolish the fed and take its assets, but that doesn't sound much like a fund to me--there is no reason to think those assets, whichever ones remain meaningful in that context, would be disbursed to dollar holders. I would expect them instead to be kept by the treasury and used to reduce the national debt.
