Great responses as usual. The Battle of Kosovo is a major example of the "genre." The overriding theme in "by winning you lose" usually comes down to the idea of a Pyrhric Victory where the enemy achieves a tactical success but at such a cost it becomes a strategic defeat (Bunker Hill in US military lore.) For entire Campaigns certainly Napoleon's against Russia then the 3rd Reich's against Russia stand out...as does the USA in Korea and Vietnam. Apparently the "Battle of Pyrhus" should be studied as well... 

For me personally I am always looking for a thesis...which almost always comes about through research first. I prefer an index card method to writing...if we're talking a town ideally go to that town and have a walk...maybe find a primary source or two. A family who's son died in the war, etc. 

In addition to the HAARP projects which are well mentioned above which achieved velocities of Mach 10 at an extraordinary altitude of 300,00 feet there is also speculations concerning a "Project Thor" which drops a tungsten rod straight down from outer space...and is perfectly legal actually. The theoretical power of such a weapon is quite spectacular. 

Sounds like a villain in a James Bond movie. Seriously...dispatching emissaries prior to any contact with friend or foe alike was I believe it was considered normative in Roman Times especially prior to giving battle as there are no greater victories than ones that require no battle be given in the first place. This would change during Imperial Rome though. As far as Medieval Europe goes it's hard to imagine the notion of chivalry without the theory of failing to give battle without losing one's honor in so doing. In Naval terms there is also the concept of "parlay" made famous by the movie series Pirates of the Caribbean and Captain Jack Sparrow. 

Wow. This is effectively asking, "please give an example of violence in History". You'd be hard-pressed to find any example of religious violence that didn't have some kind of cultural-ethnic underpinning. One of my favorite examples is Arianism. This was a difference with the Pope in Rome over the precise nature of the Holy Trinity which even most devout Christians are hard-pressed to explain. However, when German tribes were conquering the western half of the Roman empire, having a slightly heretical faith became rather convenient. It allowed them to still effectively be Christians to their new subjects, but to not have to subject themselves to the authority of the Pope. In other words, it allowed them to keep their separate identity as Germans. Once they became established (and amalgamated into the local population), they generally dropped Arianism. Moving to more recent history, I'm sure most of you know about the big kerfuffle between the Catholics and the Protestants in Northern Ireland. What isn't typically reported is that the Catholics there are typically descended from native Irish peoples, while the Protestants are descendents of Scottish folk who migrated to Ireland centuries earlier. There are of course oodles of modern examples. For instance, East Timor: Catholic (to Indonesia's Muslim), but also Tetum-speaking where Indonesia's official language is a flavor of Malay. They also spent several centuries as a Portuguese colony, and developed a unique culture different from the rest of Indonesia. Look under the hood of most of the Christian/Islamic conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, and you will see ethnic and/or cultural (eg: farming vs. herding) differences as well. Religion is just part of a society's cultural package, so it is inevitable that when cultures clash, religion will come into it. 

According to Van Manstein and Admiral Raeder who both advised Hitler to attack Great Britain immediately after crushing France in 6 weeks "they were amazed to observe that Hitler thought Great Britain was his Ally." So that ended any attempt at formally invading Great Britain...probably the only time Nazi Germany's staff was in a hurry to attack and Hitler wasn't actually. As for Babarossa Hitler stated clearly that as it related to an invasion of Russia "we were peaking miltarily in 1941 yet Russia wouldn't be for at least another year." So you tell me what that means cuz I sure don't understand it. Anywho David Glantz has written the best History by anyone concerning Generalplan Ost as he accessed the Russian Archives once the USSR fell...which showed on paper at least the Red Army to be overwhelmingly superior to the German Wehrmacht in June, 1941. Even Hitler said to Goebels "the World will hold its breath" when he kicked off the whole thing...so I think it's wrong to say he was delusional...at least initially. One major economic reason to invade Russia was for slave labor however. The 3rd Reich had massive manpower shortages during both rearmament and in fighting Britain. Since Stalin had incongruosly moved up the totality of his manpower right to the Polish border Barbarossa in theory and in fact did solve the Wehrmacht labor shortage immediately. In other words while the Army would suffer massive manpower shortages starting in 1942 the German economy would not. This had devastating consequences for France, Britain and Russia once they began the operational struggle for launching actual offensives against the "3rd Reich." None of them could have succeeded without the Americans...and the USA knew that. Since Japan attacked the United States on December 7th, 1941 I think the more interesting question is why the USA thought it could win a War on two fronts actually...which the USA did in fact do. That might explain Hitler's thinking when it came to a "two front War." In short Hitler had a very low opinion of American "fighting power"...as he often did of his enemies. 

However, many areas over 40 degrees of latitude were artificially depressed due to the weight of all that ice by about 190m lower than today's levels (yes, it weighed that much). Land moves much slower than water, so these areas are still slowing rising today. So at the higher latitudes you generally see the opposite effect of areas that were previously underwater rising. This caused particularly interesting history for the Baltic, which went through several periods of being a lake, then a sea, then a lake, then a sea, as both water and land levels rose. 

Archeologists have found evidence of religious rituals in Neanderthal burial sites 300,000 years ago. So this was likely a behavior we shared with our common ancestor, Homo Rhodensiensis at least 350K years ago when they diverged. Unsurprisingly, the first literate societies, Sumer and Egypt, used their literacy to record some of their religious practices. The oldest written work of a major world religion that is still in widespread use today is probably the Rigveda (sacred to the Hindus), which we now believe was written sometime between 1700 and 1100 BC. 

The term "art criticism", as well as the first attempt to formulate what it entails, seems to have been created by English painter Jonathan Richardson in 1719, in his essay on the Whole Art of Criticism as it Relates to Painting and an Argument in Behalf of the Science of a Connoisseur. This seems to coincide with the first large-scale public exhibitions of art in the mid 18th century. Before that there presumably were folks who criticized art, perhaps even serially. But Mr. Richardson seems to have been the first to give this activity a name (or at least the one that stuck). 

Many folks forget Great Britain had a very formidable submarine force in World War 2 too. What made U-Boats such a menace was the Fall of France and the opening of the Ports of Brittany to the Kreigsmarine. This opened up the Atlantic but not the Med as there were and in fact still are three entrances to the Med... Gibraltar, Suez and the Bosporus. Germany had alliances with Spain, Italy and Turkey therefore Great Britain with whom she was at War with on her own posed no threat to the 3rd Reich after the Fall of France in 1940. 

FDR was not an interventionist in the mold of his Uncle Teddy Roosevelt nor did he strive to be. He was very much a "Keynesian" as they are called today in that a big defense buildup as occurred as World War swept the World for a second time in a Generation...his Generation no less...so absolutely there was an economic interest in supplying weapons to those who pay for them leading up to World War 2 as there had been in World War 1. The USA was fully prepared to go to War for its own interests certainly by the Summer of 1941 when Nazi Germany invaded the USSR. This was not an unfamiliar enemy for the US military having fought on the Continent of Europe in the previous World War just 20 years prior. The interests laid out by FDR once war had come to the United States because of the attack on Pearl Harbor were laid out at the Ottawa Conference which I would Google and research if you are interested. When World War 2 ended indeed the USA experienced a massive economic boom...easily the biggest in its History...but that would be a result of WINNING the War and not of the War itself. 

It took a while for the "standard" bearded longhaired depiction to take shape. According to Wikipedia this took until the 6th century in the East, and until the 12th in the West. 

One of the arguments Barbara Tuchman makes in The March of Folly was that England's loss of its North American colonies in the American Revolution was chiefly due to how their Parliamentary system was working at the time. Basically, it was easier for individual members to get re-elected with tough talk than to argue that it might be better to reach some accommodation with the colonists. Even without that argument, if you read some of the prewar documents on both sides its pretty clear that the base of the disagreement was over government, and if some arrangement like the Dominion system had been offered early enough, it would have almost certainly been found acceptable. 

Its actually even closer than this map implies though. In the period of time that a large amount of the Hebrew scriptures were first being written down, a large part of the Jewish nation was living in exile (slavery) in Babylon. That would place them roughly in the geographic center of this map, and the cultural and trading center of near-east civilization. When Cyrus the Great (a Zoroastrian himself) conquered Babylon, he inherited this Jewish community. Not being a big fan of slavery, he freed them and allowed them to return home to Israel, and even gave them reparations to help with rebuilding some of what the Babylonians had destroyed. As a result of this, Cyrus got a faithful client state in Israel, and really good press in The Bible.
