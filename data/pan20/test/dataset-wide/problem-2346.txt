Imagine the following situation: A group of friends found a remote spot in a state or national forest that they really like. They keep returning to the place quite often, lately there are at least some members of the group staying overnight at the spot at least once or twice a month. They established a fire ring, surrounded by rocks, and someone dragged few logs around the fire to sit on. They have a rope strung in the trees to hand their food from. Now some of them have an idea that it would be nice to build few camp benches instead of the logs, and perhaps some primitive wooden shelter. It is clear that there is some sort of limit, they clearly cannot go and build a large log cabin there. There must be some sort of limit between few logs around a circle of rocks for fireplace and a cabin. I am wondering what would still be considered OK, and where one would cross the limit. 

DISCLAIMER: this is definitely not a proven advice from the book and may be suitable only for experienced climbers, who do it on their own risk! Wonder what to do if you have no spare carabiners for the carabiner brake and need to descend many rope lengths so that Munter Hitch would twist and damage it like hell? Use your ascender (I mean Petzl Ascension or something similar). If you look at it from the bottom (handle) side and add some imagination, you will see a figure eight there: 

To answer this question one could analyse the death/poisoning reports to determine, how much ventilation is NOT enough. Speaking theoretically, high CO concentration (>0.5%) is dangerous if you breathe it a couple of minutes, so if your ventilation is good enough to substitute all the air in the tent with a fresh one each 5 minutes, maybe you are ok. But please don't count on this rough estimations. Accodring to the reports, people often don't realize thay are getting poisoned, so don't be overconfident. Probably, the best way aside from not cooking inside the tent (well, sometimes CO risk is less than the risk to get frozen) is to have someone else in another non-cooking tent, who will check you every now and again. As for practice, we strictly avoid cooking inside a closed inner tent of a two-layer tent and try to keep an outer tent as open as possible. Please note, that CO poisoning is not the only poisoning risk of cooking inside: there is also a risk of breathing propane/butane escaped from a loose stove-to-canister joint or even faulty canister in your backpack. So never store fuel inside a (inner) tent. 

Now, back to hiking opportunities near Prague. There are actually several shorter but nice hikes. One of them is the "Prokopské valley". You can either take a bus to the Zlíchov station and take the blue trail up to the valley, or, from Jinonice subway station, yellow and green trails both go down. The valley has a number of interesting geological features. Other interesting areas are "Modřanská rokle" on the other side of the river, area around Roztoky and Suchdol in the north, the Botič valley in the east, and several other smaller areas. These are all shorter hikes, partly through urban or suburban environment, but can be quite nice. For longer hikes, and more natural ones, I recommend the region in the south of Prague. It is more hilly, with some prety good hiking. Probably the most mountain like part of this region is the area called Brdy. It is a range of wooded hills that stretch from the southern edge of Prague for some 50 or 60 km south west past Příbram. Unfortunately the central part of this range belongs to the military and is mostly closed to the public, but the northern part has some very nice hiking. There are several ways how to get there from Prague: 

Overshoes When the boots' warmth is not enough, you can use overshoes. Basically, it's nothing more than a sack made of cloth , which you put over your boot and fasten somehow: 

Make sure the problem is in the shoes first. First, if you run on asphalt, try running on dirt trails. They are softer and provide much less shock to your joints. Second, make sure your running technic is correct. I would recommend the book from a world champion Gordon Pirie, which is very understandable by a non-professional runner. One basic idea from the book is that you should land on your toe, not on your heel. This introduces another joint to participate in shock absorbtion, distributing the force more evenly. I don't claim that this is the only right technic, but it does work. The book has advice on running shoes too, but they are quite different from what you usually hear from the adverticements. I have had the same problem too, and running on the dirt + landing on my toe (well, more on my toe, than on my heel) pushed the limit from 1 our to 2+ hours. 

Krakow is amazingly beautiful and interesting town, so you may end up spending all your time in the town itself, but there are some great opportunities for hiking nearby. There are several websites about Krakow that you can look at. This one lists some ideas for day trips. The Ojcow national park is just north of Krakow, apparently it is possible to get there by bus. If you are willing to travel a bit further, about 70km south of Krakow are the Beskidy mountains, with Gorczanski and Babigorski national parks. All of those are definitely worth seeing, and offer plenty of hiking opportunities. It takes about hour and 30 minutes to get from Krakow Main station to Sucha Beskidzka, which is sort of a gateway into that part of Beskidy mountains. There is a very nice brochure(pdf) describing some hiking opportunities in the region. 

I made myself a simple wood burning stove from a small tomato can, and I am pretty happy with it, but now I am wondering if I would get significantly increased performance by making a more complicated double wall "bushbuddy" style stove. Does anybody have any experience with DIY double wall wood burning stoves? Is there enough increase in performance to justify the more complicated design? 

PS. This is mostly an example of how you can think out of the box. PPS. Thinking out of the box is your own risk. I personally would use this method only as the last resort if other methods fail (e.g. in the middle of an expedition, when you can't throw away your ropes after the descent). PPPS. Yes, this was used in practice. PPPPS. No, there are even weirder methods, e.g.: $URL$ 

Try Atlas travel insurance from HCC MIS: $URL$ It only excludes professional sports and competitions (if not speaking of death payments). All non-professional sport is included in standard price. Never had any accidents with it, though. 

Why, you can sacrifice some huge-size rubber boots for this. Warmth upgrade Overshoes by themselves provide additional warmth, but this may be not enough. To get really warm one should add another layer - warm overshoe ("chuni") - between the boot and the overshoe. Basically it's crafted just alike, but you use a warm cloth (e.g. Polartec-100/200) and you don't need laces. 

I spent some time in a wigwam today, and due to the wind conditions, it was very difficult to keep the smoke out. Are there some tricks one can use in a situation like that to make the wigwam more habitable, or to deal with the smoke in some way? 

You will then follow the red trail through Karlík valley and Mořinka all the way to Karlštejn. The castle in Karlštejn is a very popular tourist attraction, and can be pretty crowded. Most visitors take a train or bus to the village, and climb the souvenir shop encrusted road up to the castle. The red trail will bring you to the castle from different side. You will still have to pass through some of the madness, but you will avoid the worst. You can visit the castle if you want. Then continue on the red trail past the castle. Keep following the red trail till you get to an intersection of several trails called "Propadlé Vody". From there you have number of options, but my favorite always was to take the yellow trail to the north, marked on the map as "Svatojánský okruh" (St. John circle). It will take you past the Arnika cave, through some interesting long abandoned limestone quarries all the way to a vist point on the top of the cliff overlooking the St. John valley and the monastery. Bacrtacking a bit and following the trail further will take you down to the valley. From there, you have several options. You can take the blue trail north and catch a train or bus in Vráž. You can stay on the red trail and end up in the city of Beroun, with several options for transportation back tp Prague. Or you can take the yellow trail south to Srbsko, where you can take a train back to Prague. If you want to hike more, you have a number of options, including those: 

I use tape medical plaster for labeling tubes: wrap your tube in it and then write over using a pen or permament marker. The plaster just makes the surface less smooth and the writing can't be rubbed of that easily. It's not waterproof, though. The other idea which has just occured to me is to use some sharp object to carve your lables in plastic. So even if the marker paint goes off, you'll be able to read the label. 

The most obvious thing is an emergency blanket. It will add a lot of extra insulation per gram. It'a good to have one in you bag on any trip. However, a mere blanket is definitely not enough for all seasons, elevations and weather conditions. When planning at home, you should ask yourself a question: "What will happen to me if I have to be on the route overnight?" Than take this much insulation that will make the answer not worse than "no permanent injury". While at home, think of where (at which points of your route) would you sleep if something happens. Good shelter is very important, because wind and elements take a huge amount of heat from you. On top of the mountain is the worst, near a wall is better, between 3 walls (rocks) is even better, snow cave is the best (so learn how to dig one, if you are going very high up or in winter). Another lifesaver is water boiling gear (I'd recommend JetBoil), it also has a very high rate of heating per gram (compared e.g. to clothes). Of course you'll need water to boil, so know where you can find it or take some extra. 

To get some idea what you can see in Brdy, you can look at this site. Another great area for hiking, less hilly but perhaps more interesting, is just on the other side of the Berounka river. The "Český Kras" (Bohemian Karst) is somewhat more popular and can be, at least in some areas, quite crowded, but if you avaid the most obvious tourist attractions, you can find some excellent hinkng. Again, there is a number of ways how to get there: 

Finally, my third suggestion is the Sázava river valley. Take a train from the Bráník train station to Pikovice, take a red trail, cross the river and follow it upstream (again, depending on how much time you have, you may want to start closer to Prague, or even in Prague. You can catch the same red trail in Zbraslav or Vrané. In fact, it is just a different part of the same red trail that leads through Karlštejn.) The trail will closely follow the Sázava river, with a nice view of its rapids. You can follow it all the way to Kamený Přívoz, where it will cross the river again. There you will have several options. You can take a train back to Prague, follow a series of green, blue, red and yellow trails back to Pikovice or even to Prague, or continue on the red trail to Prosečnice. From there you can take the yellow trail through Vlčí Rokle (the Wolf Ravine), which is quite interesting and nice. After that you will have a whole scale of possibilities, there are number of trails that you can take, most of them leading you eventually to a train or bus station. Hopefully this will be at least somewhat helpful. Enjoy your visit. Perhaps one more advice: Czechs are generally rather fond of hiking, and many of them know their hiking areas quite well. If you are going there for a conference, for business, of to visit friends, you may want to ask your hosts where to hike. They will probably be able to give you a better, more current advice, and perhaps they will even go with you. 

(some other designs are shown here) If you need to use it with SNS/NNN ski boots, make small cuts on the toe. (The other option for skiing may be removing overshoes sole and glueing the remainder to the boot - a lot of expensive ski boots are made like this, but you can add another layer;)). Durability upgrade As you may have noticed, this design implies a relatively thin fabric being between your sole and the ground, so if you are not wearing skis or crampons, it's damaged easily. So it's recommended to make the sole of the overshoe thicker. The best thing for walking is an overshoe combined with rubbers/galoshes: 

TL;DR You can do a lot of things at night, but acting in a dark world is fundamentally different. Adaptation is required and a group of friends is required too. Still sitting near a bright fire and chatting with you friends after a long day (night?;)) of cold and dark adventures is one of the best moments you can get. 

The country is crisscrossed by an extensive system of inteconnected hiking trails, that allows you to get on foot from pretty much any place to any other place. The system is maintained by the Klub Českých Turistů (Czech Tourist Club), and consists of two components: trail markings and corresponding maps. Each trail is assigned one of four colors: red, yellow, green or blue. It used to be that red color was reserved for long distance trails, often following a long mountain range or a similar such feature, yellow trails were shorter, branching from the red ones, and green and blue were reserved for local or connecting trails, but as far as I can tell, that is no longer strictly followed. The trails are marked in terain by trail marks that look like a horizontal color stripe (red, yellow, green or blue) between two horizontal white stripes, like this: 

There is another problem with making a fire in a natural cave: the smoke propagating through the cave can severely affect various cave-dwelling species, particularly bats. That is especially bad during winter, when smoke and warm air from the fire can wake up the bats and drive them out of the cave, causing them to freeze or starve to death.
