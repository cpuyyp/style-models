Assume that volume scales linearly with height (i.e. we'll roughly approximate the building shape as a cube). The mass/weight of your constructions will scale roughly as the cube of height (we'll assume the volume of the building scales linearly with height - meaning the x-y footprint goes up as the height does). However the structural strength only scales as the square of volume. So no matter how strong our materials, we eventually get too big to support a bigger building. Increased materials strength can improve your results but it can't change the shape of the curve - no matter how strong the material. If the building exceeds the size above, it will always collapse under its own weight. Materials To look at this from a materials perspective it helps to have an idea of the pertinent equations. The force on the building is the weight (mass * acceleration) of the portions of the building above the current floor. $$ W = a_{gravity} \cdot m = a_{gravity} \cdot \rho \cdot V = a_{gravity} \cdot \rho \cdot l^3 $$ $$ F_{compression} = A \cdot \sigma_{compression} = l^2 \cdot \sigma_{compression} $$ At max load, the maximum compressive force your structure can support is equal to its weight, so you get this: $$ a_{gravity} \cdot \rho \cdot l^3 = l^2 \cdot \sigma_{compression} \rightarrow l_{max} = \frac{\sigma_{compression}}{a_{gravity} \cdot \rho} $$ V = volume ($m^3$) A = Area ($m^2$) l = distance ($m$) $\sigma$ = material strength (Pascals - $Pa$) g = acceleration due to gravity ($\frac{m}{s^2}$) $\rho$ = density ($\frac{kg}{m^3}$) Maximum measured compressive strength of any material (diamond) comes in at something between 100 & 300 GPa. So make the following assumptions $g = 9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ $\sigma = 300 GPa$ $\rho = 2,500 \frac{kg}{m^3}$ Solve for $l$: $$ l_{max} = \frac{300,000,000,000 \frac{kg}{m \cdot s}}{9.8 \frac{m}{s^2} \cdot 2,500 \frac{kg}{m^3}} = 12,244,898 m$$ 12 million meters (12,000 km) is a pretty tall building. Your limitation on height would not be due to materials constraints (if you use the right materials). Bear in mind that this structure would be solid at the base with no room for anything other than structure, the material would have to be diamond, and the crust of the planet it was on would sag so the actual height would be substantially smaller. In fact the shear amount of materials involved would probably be the equivalent of a planetoid (that's not a moon!). Foundation But what sort of foundation can hold up that kind of mass. Although the Earth's crust seems rigid, the reality is it floats on top of the Earth's mantle and is not rigid enough to support even its own mass - it has to float on the Earth's mantle. The highest points on Earth all exist in the Himalayan Mountain range. In that range, one continental crust is subducting under another. It has pushed the top plate over 5 miles high but this lofty altitude can only be supported by the crust sagging 60 miles or more deep beneath it. What this means for your building project is that even a sufficiently advanced society are likely to be unable to create large structures of more than 5 miles or before the crust starts sagging beneath the weight of the structure. Otherstuff Typical engineering for ground structures (like buildings) uses a factor of safety of 10x. Meaning you design the building for 10x the load its supposed to support. This ignores any other forces such as wind, dynamic stresses, buckling, earthquakes, etc. 

Mine too will be a partial answer. Depending upon the response, I might put more of what I have up here. But this took me the last 4 hours to put together. I'll include data that I can quickly summarize and provide any other useful insights (such as any formulae) I can think of. I'm not familiar with the website so I can't do a comparison / critique but plan to investigate it in the future. Number of stars in system This is a quick heuristic I created to approximate the number of stars in a stellar system. $$\begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{Odds} & \text{Num of Stars} \\ \hline \text{20%} & 1 \\ \hline \text{50%} & 2 \\ \hline \text{15%} & 3 \\ \hline \text{10%} & 4 \\ \hline \text{3%} & 5 \\ \hline \text{2%} & 6 \\ \hline \text{possible} & 7 \\ \hline \text{possible} & 8 \\ \hline \end{array}$$ Star Generation When you generate a star for your stellar system, you should include some test to ensure you don't have greatly mismatched possible stellar ages for the stars in your system. A 20 billion year old M class dwarf won't usually be orbiting an O class dwarf that's only 10 million years old (it would instead be orbiting the remnant of that start). I don't have any heuristic to account for matching companion ages yet. Assumptions In my own notes, I do not identify the assumptions I made - I simply made them, move on, and forgot them. I'll try to document them as I go through my materials so some of my answers don't seem so mysteriously disconnected from reality. 

Estimating timing Wikipedia states that world production of container ships was ~11,000,000 tons in 2011 and our Super Orions would require similar (but more stringent) levels of construction difficulties (remember we can use normal construction materials like steel). So without straining we could build on average 1 of these Super Orions per year but each would require multi-year construction (say 5 years like US aircraft carriers or perhaps even 10-15 years). We'd be done in 5,200 years. With straining, (I would guess) we could build 10x this number. We'd be done in 520 years. With all out desperation, the upper bounds of what we could make would be determined by our critical resource production (such as steel). Assume our 8,000,000 tonne craft are composed entirely of steel and that this is our limiting resource. This site indicates world steel production is around: 

Isolation and collapse to Kardashev Level 2 Civilization If current theories about the Universe, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy are correct; then we're beginning a period of ever increasing acceleration of objects away from each other. What this means is in the future, galaxies accelerate away from us so that they fall outside our light-cone. Eventually we won't see galaxies outside of our own ever again. Similarly if the Universal Expansion continues, then the stars within our galaxy will begin accelerating away from each other. First, imperceptibly and later at ever increasing accelerations. How do you remain a Kardashev III+ civilization without a galaxy's worth of resources to tap into? What they see is sometime in their future there will be a collapse of their civilization to a primitive Kardashev level II civilization. If we on Earth would find a civilization collapse difficult, how might a galaxy spanning civilization view its shattering into and isolation of its constituent stellar systems? 

Plotwise it isn't as interesting because once it's triggered, it propagates at or near the speed of light - meaning no information about the event can outrace its effects AND there is absolutely nothing you can do about it after it has been triggered. If the event is triggered, it will ultimately devastate the entire Universe. Ironically, the event could have already been triggered and we will never know it. The event is so devastating, it is possible that not even subatomic particles will survive. 

Governments and political systems have been observed to follow cycles. One such cycle is Tytler's (shown below): 

Wormhole handles The matter with negative mass, which holds your wormhole open, also gives it anchor points. If you move the framework of this matter, you also must move the wormhole. So if you want a plausible wormhole, you must also plan for it to have handles that humans can move around. Time travel Whether you like it or not, the introduction of FTL through space, also gives you time travel. Kip Thorne's discussion of Time Travel and Wormholes: 

Shocker #2 People living in a post scarcity society are all around for us to observe. I realize our current society is not what you meant by living in a post-scarcity society. However, there is a group of people who can demonstrate how people's lives might be in a post-scarcity society. These are the retire early folks. These are people, who through a variety of means, have accumulated enough wealth that they have no need to continue working. What do these people do? 

Meat eating (both carnivore and omnivore) >> herbivore & insectivore Social living >> solitary living 

3-D Printing Ultimately, economic self-sufficiency won't be enough for a colony. It'll need to be able to survive without resupply (if necessary). IMO, this is where 3D printing (and other "additive manufacturing" techniques) are a really exciting development. If you can supply the raw materials many different types items can be created with them as long as you have the design program. Need a locking mechanism for your airlock? Program the part into your 3D printer, fill the feed bin with the proper materials, and a few hours later, voila: a new airlock mechanism. Such devices will never replace high volume (& therefore cheap & high speed) manufacturing methods but would be perfect for the needs of a space colony. So the real requirement would be to have the ability to build those 3D printer devices. What Else? I view a population like a pyramid. You need a certain number of people at each level to support developments at higher levels. A space colony (with our current levels of knowledge and technology) will require lots of specialized knowledge and skills to keep going. In a terrestrial country, it requires a certain population base to maintain a high technology levels. Some city-states side-step the issue by being embedded in a larger country that provides that support base. But what that means is that the colony will either need to support a huge population, or a lot of work and technological advances will need to be achieved to "dumb down" the knowledge and skill requirements of the colony. So instead of an active closed-loop environmental system that requires human maintenance, we'd have research and develop a passive environmental system that maintains itself (think spaceship Earth). Transportation Except for perishable items, transportation will use the Interplanetary Transportation Network. Such trajectories use much less energy ($\Delta V$) than low-energy Hohmann Orbit transfers but can take decades to complete. Humans or some other perishable items will at least require Hohmann Orbit Transfers. 

No I calculate for desirable surface temperatures, the planet's mass needs to be close to 40% of the Earth's mass in order to retain Oxygen-Nitrogen with gaseous water over geological time. A colder surface temperature can lower that mass somewhat (perhaps down to 35%) but you're talking about permanent Arctic like conditions. However, the collision of these two bodies will generate a great deal of heat. That will be enough to melt vast portions of the combined planet. In fact, it'll probably vaporize most the water provided by Ganymede and some will be lost to space. It is likely the surface will remain uninhabitable due to the high temperatures for many thousands to a million years or so. Even worse, the plan suffers from another problem. Assume everything else works and you get a planet with the proper temperature, mass, etc. Ganymede possesses so much water (about 50x as much as on the Earth). Earth's water covers its surface to an average depth of 2,700 m or 2.7 km. Ganymede's water will cover Mars to an average depth of 521 km and will cover everything - including Olympus Mons. So good news, you may remelt Marmede's core and generate a magnetic field. Bad news, don't expect to move in for the likely life of the human species and when you can move in, you'd better be sporting flippers. 

Some other variations of the answers already provided are: Prepositioned equipment. Landing the necessary equipment before the arrival of the inhabitants. von Neumann machines Classic von Neumann machines just self-replicate. Instead this would self-replicate and then begin preconstructing the city prior to the arrival of the inhabitants. This mechanism allows the machines to be preprogrammed with set objects. For example: 

I like all the thought from the other answers but wanted to add something. A light saber is deadly whether you swing in an arc (like a saber) or stab with the point (like a foil / epee). If I was fighting with a light saber, I'd fight using foil / epee fighting techniques. It is much easier to block a swing of the sword than it is a stab. Anyone dropping his guard long enough to take a swing at me would be instantly skewered. It just takes one touch... 

At present there is no method of successfully cryogenically freezing living mammals. Even worse, even if we could successfully force crew into hibernation, cosmic rays and information loss would eventually kill the frozen crew (or embryos). They would have to be awoken from sleep during the trip so that the body's cellular repair processes could repair the damage induced over time. I've recently seen a reference with the actual numbers but don't have it handy. I'll look for it an link it if I can find it. FWIW, I thought I saw a calculation showing that a number on the order of 100 years would be the limit for sleep cycles. Then the crew (or individuals) would have to be awoken and given time for their body's to repair the damage. 

No There are no known macroscopic structures composed solely of non-Baryonic matter Antimatter is *atomic* matter Antimatter is Baryonic matter which forms atoms when positrons ($e^+$) are added. It interacts (reacts) quite vigorously with normal atomic matter. Just like normal matter, it possesses mass, charge, etc. You should consider anti-matter as atomic matter too. Even "neutronium" the exotic nuclear soup/plasma found in neutron stars are made from Baryonic matter. Other types of matter don't clump The problem with other forms of matter (non-baryonic Hadrons and Fermions) is: first, they usually don't clump like the Baryons to form larger structures like nuclei and second, you can't get different non-Baryonic Hadron clumps to stick together in a manner similar to that of the chemical bonds that atoms can form. Any other possibilities? It's not impossible that exotic behaviors like what you want could occur in a quark-gluon plasmas under extreme conditions. However, under conditions we encounter every day, those behaviors would not live long enough for what you likely want. Similarly these clumps won't be on the same size scale as you & me. They might get as large as nuclei. Pentaquarks and other exotic Baryonic matter are probably your best bet. If you could find a Pentaquark with enough stability then from the outside, it would behave similarly to a normal baryon - except more massive. Since quarks carry +/- 1/3, +/- 2/3, or 0 charge; then you could get a baryon with really weird charges. Many of the possible combinations are likely not stable but since it's your story you can make the rules. Unfortunately, we have no way to tell you what the macroscopic properties of such a material might be. How about even weirder stuff? There are a bunch of weirder particles that are not part of the Standard Model (the most widely accepted theory of what particles we should expect) but are not expressly forbidden by other things we know about physics. Some of these are fairly well known (Tachyons & magnetic monopoles). A lesser known one is negative mass (not anti) matter. Monopoles at least are predicted to exist by some current theoretical models but would tend to repel each other and not form larger structures. However, we've never directly or indirectly observed these exotic particles and the chances of them being real are very slim. Tachyons aren't supported by theory but aren't really forbidden either. The main trouble with these is that we could only observe them by their interaction with normal matter. We haven't found any particle interactions which might be accounted for by them. Negative mass matter is hypothetical only. Common Sense If such materials were possible, we would have observed them in nature. Story trumps Science If such a material is necessary for your story, then simply invoke it as one of the fictions of your story. Larry Niven needed materials with fantastic properties for his Ringworld so he imagined scrith. 

Energy + salt water $\rightarrow NaCl + H_2O$ (through desalinization) Energy + $CO_2 + 2H_2O \rightarrow 2O_2 + CH_4$ Energy + human waste + spiralina (algae) + $ H_2O \rightarrow $ food + clean $H_2O + O_2$ 

Hydrosphere We will need excess water for standing bodies of water and icecaps. I will estimate the liquid water requirement by scaling Moon / Earth ocean mass to the ratio of Moon / Earth surface area. 

With Cetaceans diverging from them at the Order (Order - Cetacea, Family - Delphinidae) level. Crows are birds which are closely related to mammals and diverging from them at the Class (Class - Aves, Order - Passerifores, Family - Corvidae) level. Only the cuttlefish are significantly different, diverging at the Phylum level - pretty high in our phylogenetic tree (Phylum - Mollusca, Subphylum - ??, Class - Cephalopoda, Order - Sepiida, Family - Sepiidae). Nearly everything we think of as intelligent in this world is extremely closely related to each other from a phylogenetic and genealogical perspective. We have the same basic structure (bilateral symmetry based upon a quadrupedal layout), have nearly all the same organs, use the same proteins, enzymes, etc. Our surfaces are mostly similar (with hair and feathers interchangeable). Even though it's different and really stands out as being different, it too descended from the same basic set of biochemistry as other intelligent life on Earth. Now imagine an alien life form from a planet which uses a completely different biochemistry. Would it be even more different from all intelligent terrestrial life as cuttlefish are from humans? SF Treatment Most SF treatment of this problem is similar to Star Trek. Dress the alien up in a strange costume, give the actor some bumps on their forehead, and call them an alien. We go along with the gag for convenience but in reality if scientists discovered aliens like this - we'd have to assume we shared common ancestry and not all that long ago (10s of millions of years at the most).
