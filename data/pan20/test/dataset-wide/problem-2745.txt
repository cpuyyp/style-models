and so forth. For every ordinal α, we define α+1 := α ∪ {α}. Where cardinals express the size of a set, such as {a,b,c}, the ordinals describe the order type of a sequence, such as (a,b,c). This only becomes important when you have infinitely long sequences, however. About the first several-infinite ordinals To illustrate what the purpose of the ordinals are in the study of the infinite, first I have to introduce you to a few-infinite number of them. We order the ordinals by saying that α < β if and only if α ∈ β. This is important when we start talking about infinite ordinals. The first infinite ordinal is what comes from considering the set of all of the finite ordinals. It describes a sequence of elements which are well-ordered, but which has no final element: (0,1,2,...). We call this ordinal ω. We then define the next largest ordinal by ω+1 := ω ∪ {ω}, as before: this describes an ordering (0,1,2,...,ω), where there are an infinite number of elements hiding in the ellipses, but where there is no "item that comes just before ω"; any consecutive collection of items which contains ω and some items which come before it must have infinitely many elements. This is just a result of the way that ω was defined. It's what is known as a limit ordinal: it comes at the end of an infinite sequence of elements which lead up to it, putting a cap on top of an infinite subsequence. We get other limit ordinals by piling infinitely many other ordinals on top of it: we have ω+2 := (ω+1) ∪ {ω+1}, and we can define ω+3, ω+4, etc. the same way until we can define       2ω := {0,1,2,3...,ω,ω+1,ω+2,ω+3,...} = 0 ∪ 1 ∪ 2 ∪ ... ∪ ω ∪ (ω+1) ∪ (ω+2) ∪ ... as being the collection of all of the ordinals up to ω, and then gotten from ω again by increments. Then we may define 2ω+1, 2ω+2, and so forth up to 3ω; and so forth ad infinitum. We then get another limit ordinal,       ω2 := 0 ∪ ω ∪ 2ω ∪ 3ω ∪ 4ω ∪ ... in a similar way to how the limit ordinals ω, 2ω, and so forth are defined. (We would normally also include 1, 2, 3, ω+1, ω+2, 2ω+1, and so forth in the union; but I'm trying to just sketch the construction.) This would allow us ultimately to define ordinals such as ω2+3ω+7 by repeating the same process as before for the ordinals 2ω, 3ω, etc.. We then proceed to define 2ω2 as the limit of all ordinals obtained by adding combinations of ω and finite integers to ω2; and then we may come to define 3ω2 and 4ω2; and eventually we may come up with the idea of defining ω3 as the limit of all of the ordinals involving combinations of ω2, ω, and finite integers. We may go about defining ω4, and ω5, until eventually after infinitely many iterations we are moved to define ωω, and ωω+1, ωω+2, ω2ω, and the process never really stops. What all of these ordinals are doing is capturing notions of ordering. Each new ordinal that we define extends the ones which came before. The reason why this is important is that they aren't capturing any difference of size at all — after ω, all of the ordinals that I've described to you thus far have exactly the same number of elements, when we describe the size of a set by cardinality. The ordinal numbers are clearly capturing a lot of information about structure, in that there are many limit ordinals which only come after infinitely long sequences of successive iterations, e.g. as 8ω2+3ω comes only after the entire sequence 8ω2+2ω+1, 8ω2+2ω+2, 8ω2+2ω+3, ... but if you allow yourself to consider ways of matching up elements in a way which does not preserve the order of the elements, you can match the elements of all of these "polynomials" of ω with each other. 

Social contract theory is the idea that any given society has a set of conventions and trade-offs which it demands or requires, in order for participation in it to be possible and for the society to continue to exist. In particular, it recognises that authority exists inasmuch as the members of society cede power to the authority (voluntarily and on average — ideally, though not necessarily, as a carefully considered decision). If we recognise that there are usually "social norms" which lie outside of the purview of law, but which are still well within the domain of moral judgement (and even occasionally vigilante action), we may recognise that social contract theory extends beyond the formal trappings of society, and into the culture of the society. There are behaviours and rights which are informally recognised, and informally defended; and there are duties which are informally demanded, and informally coerced. Much of politics and public discussion about both politics and philosophy represents a continuous negotiation of this social contract, and discussion about to what extent it should be formalised by being written into law. As noted in the IEP link above, notions of this sort may be traced back as far as Socrates, who while imprisoned by a formal process, chooses not to escape because of a recognition of the values he holds in conjunction with the operation of society, despite having willing would-be conspirators. The first recognised modern advocate of social contract theory in European philosophy is Thomas Hobbes, who held that the King of England (in a time of civil war, and in a time when the so-called Divine Right of Kings was in question) did not have any absolute right to rule, but had his position of authority on the basis of the willingness of society to allow him to govern and ideally to wield executive power to maintain as stable and well-organised government as possible. In this sense Hobbes was not concerned with the execuition of the law, but rather the basis of law, and how society gives rise to the formal programmes that it has through informal shared values. 

Who needs a time machine, or quantum mechanics? All you need is randomness of some sort, which quantum mechanics happens to have. If you're content to consider simple coin-flips as random, you have the same problem. Imagine: in the 16th century, William Shakespeare had a really boring decade. He was so incredibly bored that he took up mathematics, which he discovered he had a talent for. His mathematical inventions were: 

One accepts the absurd because it is banal, like the weather: arbitrary but every-day. Take your title question. Why should you drink a cup of coffee, rather than killing yourself? Because, perhaps, you enjoy drinking coffee. But why should that matter? Well, it's a priority — and interestingly, because coffee is an acquired taste, it is a priority which you have probably cultivated over years. Why did you do that? Partly because it is a stimulant, and partly because of the cultural context your found yourself in, in which the cultivation of the taste of coffee is valued. And so on. You are dancing in a nonsense game where everyone is constantly learning, and negotiating, the rules; except for some apparently fixed ones which we call the laws of physics, whose loopholes we are trying to exploit in a project which we call technology. Your whole life you have been immersed in this absurd world, so that you don't even notice it any more. To recognise the absurd consciously is akin to being a healthy middle-class citizen of the western world, who pauses to realise their priviledge. It is to take notice of something which is so banal that it fades into the background, so that one forgets it entirely, and can only recall it with deliberate effort. You embrace the absurd because it's what you're going to do anyway, and what everyone else does every day without paying too much attention to it. You embrace the absurd because it is normal. Consciously embracing the absurd just gives you more leeway into the way that you embrace it, so that your life may be absurd in a slightly more interesting way if you choose.
