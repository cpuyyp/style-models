There are many options to try out. Please don't stop - you're on the right track. Before each run session, prepare your body a little bit through some dynamic stretching to prime your muscles and joints for the effort. This should be part of every session. If you are pressed for time, cut back on your actual running time (and mileage) to fit in a routine similar to this link video. When you are out running, focus on good form more than speed or distance. Without seeing you run, or knowing how you run, here are a few pointers on good form: 

I have not had a discussion with an insurance provider, or had the need to have that conversation. But, I have had similar conversations with similar, physically strong people with regards to BMI. I doubt any single person will change the health industry from using BMI as a guideline for insurance premiums. I do not work for an insurance provider, but if we are to use a single measurement of health, there are arguments for using BMI. BMI is body MASS index. In simple terms, it is simply the effect of your MASS on your heart. Mass is not biased. Two hundred pounds of mass is 200 pounds. There is no difference on the stress of your heart if that two hundred pounds is 4% body fat or 40% body fat. The heart still needs to support the stress of 200 pounds. Yes, absolutely, 4% body fat is generally better than 40% body fat especially in terms of high blood pressure, blood sugar, etc. But, again, BMI is all about total MASS, not body composition. I think we are trained, maybe from various media, that the term obese is only associated with high fat and overweight people. But, in reality obesity is simply a measure of mass or BMI. If again we accept that BMI is a valid measure of simply stress on the heart, then one must agree that the BMI scale is a good single indicator for health insurance companies. With heart disease and heart attacks being top causes of death and other related (high cost) issues in the United States, it's simply a way of filtering the highest risk candidates with the lowest number of tests. 

I'd also recommend doing a high rep sets of Good Mornings with no weight for extra lower back work around the house. Good mornings hit both the lower back and glutes/hamstrings. Everything back in that region of your body is connected very tightly so good glutes/hamstrings are just as important to lower back strength and stability as your lower back muscles are. 

I think the proper answer to this question is to do everything in your power possible to maintain proper form at > 99.9% of the time. If that means dropping the weight, then do so. Gutting out those last few reps on your heaviest sets with poorer technique is not worth the potential damage it will do. If you really are intent on attempting those last few reps at increased weight, then make sure you always have a spotter to help you squat. Mentally this allows you to focus on your technique and not worry about failing or cheating because your spotter, assuming the spotters knows what to do, will be able to let you finish. 

If you are dealing with racquet sports, you really need to be able to sprint quickly in very short bursts of no more than 15 yards (often shorter) at a time with the ability to recover and change direction quickly. With that said, going out and sprinting as hard as you can in a straight line for 40 yards (like the much ballyhoo'ed speed test for American football) isn't going to be very important for you. What you need to focus on first step quickness (getting you going in correct direction as fast as possible) and hip explosion (makes sure you achieve maximum acceleration once you are moving in a particular direction). Improving your acceleration to your top speed is going to be more important than increasing your top speed. For actual running drills to improve this I'd recommend: 

Push-ups shouldn't be engaging your abdominals enough to cause a lot of fatigue unless you are pausing for a particularly long time between repetitions, in which case you might be performing a plank unintentionally. I'd be more suspicious that your form is off. If possible, get a friend to watch your form after reviewing ideal form from models and have him/her call you on it if you start cheating your form. In the unlikely event that your abdominals are truly just too weak to support you during a pushup/chest workout, you should probably just switch up one of your chest workouts with an abdominal workout. I'm a fan of the above-linked planks, medicine ball axe chops, and V-ups 

As a diabetic, I can very easily tell you that the answer is that there isn't a way. Trust me, if there were, we wouldn't be using blood monitors. All the expletives in the English language cannot describe how much they suck. Anyone who claims the spring loaded lancets are painless is trying to sell you one. Period. 

As you say, your biggest challenge is to avoid doing too much at once. Exactly what is 'best' is going to be subjective for the most part, so what I'm going to do is give you a few stages you can set goals at and work toward without getting too overwhelmed. On the diet side: 

As you've probably figured out by this point, skin sag CAN last forever if you remain unhealthy even after you get rid of your weight. If you get healthier after you get rid of the weight, your body will repair itself and get rid of the unneeded, and likely throughly dead, cells. How fast that happens will depend on how healthy you are and how much sag you have. If you lose weight the right way, at about 2-4 pounds per week max, you should not have a huge amount of sag by the time you hit your target weight, anyway. This is doubly true for you since you're still relatively young. Unless you have some sort of chronic illness, I've got confidence you'll do just fine! 

A friend asked me once if eating a banana was a good post-work out snack, to which I gave him a knee jerk reply of "any fruit is a good post work-out snack". I've conditioned myself in to thinking this because I've often heard and have experienced myself that having something that consists of simple carbohydrates (e.g. the natural sugars in fruit) that is also nutritious after a workout is a great way to start replenishing your body. But is fruit really that great post-workout by itself? Should you combine those simple carbohydrates with something else post-workout beyond water for rehydration? What about proteins and fats post-workout (either immediately or within 1-2 hours of finishing)? Are all fruits created equally in this context of being a post-workout snack or are some better than others? Let's assume that by "workout" I mean something between 30 minutes to 1 hour where your heartrate is averaging over 70% of your maximum heart rate. If that doesn't narrow it down, perhaps answers may describe what workouts are a post-workout snack of fruit desirable and which ones aren't. 

In addition to Meade's answer, I'd recommend doing any lift that involves a pulling motion from a wide variety of angles. This includes 

No - tennis shoes are going to be slightly heavier and have more material/cushioning around the sides. They are meant for stability and lots of side to side movement. Running shoes are lighter and are built for forward movement. You will experience aches of all kinds of you do jogging/running in tennis shoes at any amount of frequency more than about a mile a day. 

I was interested to know the answer to this question myself, and ended up asking it to a few of my chiropractor and osteopath friends. The short answer I got is 'no'. Muscles are, generally speaking, muscles. If you push them to their limit, you're going to get DOMS no matter what. What complicates the simple answer is that some muscle groups are harder to put into DOMS simply because they're more isolated and difficult to separate from the rest of the body. The IT band on the outside of your leg is a good example of an extremely important muscle that is very important to tone properly if you're working for performance, but by the same token it is nearly impossible to separate it fully from the quads. There's also simply the fact that people have different weak points. A DOMS reaction may be inhibited simply by the ligaments and tendons surrounding the muscle not being up to snuff, which causes a lot of radiating burn during workout, but fairly little lingering pain since these tissues are fairly small and can be repaired easily. Knowing that you have sub-par connective tissue like that is practically impossible without figuring it out yourself. The question this brings up is, are you even capable of working your muscle hard enough to induce a DOMS reaction? Or is your connective tissue going to give out first? As a footnote, it is important to include that this was largely a physiological theory discussion, and not 'studies have shown x, y, and z.' I would consider it reliable simply because it makes perfect sense in what we know of the human body, but I hesitate to go around touting it as scientific fact. 

However, with any pulling motion be sure you achieve a full range of motion. A full range of motion here implies extending your arms to the point where you feel a stretch in your lats and pulling as far as you can to the point where your elbows/shoulders are back as far as possible (your chest should poke out broad at the end of each rep). This ensures your lats receive the maximum amount of contraction and extension and gives them the proper work. Otherwise your biceps may be performing a larger percentage of the lift than needed and steal from your lats. Also, when doing bench/incline presses, your lats work at the very base of the lift when you use a full range of motion (bar/dumbells all the way down to your chest). Be sure to push with your lats as much as possible on your initial movement up. 

Those are popular in American football but would just as applicable to racquet sports. As for lifts, you want anything that encourages explosion from an athletic position - box jumps, squats, cleans, dead lifts. Make sure those are part of your lifting routines. 

Regarding whether to know if you are eating too little, I can often judge this by my energy level at any given time... especially toward the end of a strenuous exercise session. If I'm entirely more lethargic than I'm used to being that means I either got too little sleep or probably didn't have enough calories available. Since sleep is rather easy to track it makes it easy to determine if this is a nutrition problem. This is terribly simplifying the task of nutrition, since you also need to consider proper balance and quality of food, but it's a simple enough metric that you can play by ear. Now, as for knowing if you are hungry or not, often times the signal for hunger is similar to the signal we receive when we are dehydrated. What I'd suggest doing, and what I do, is to immediately drink around 16oz of water the minute I start to feel hungry and crave food. If 30 minutes later I am still hungry, then I allow myself to eat, otherwise, I chalk up the craving to dehydration. 

These are just some very basic things, and I'd urge you to see a professional to get help on specifics, though. 

There will be some minor differences in how you develop, but as far as your goals go as long as you keep your heart rate in the correct zone (check these links if you need info on what's correct), you'll be making progress toward your goal. 

Stop eating fast food. This will break you of some of your bad habits and provide a good basis for a new routine. Stop eating out completely, unless it's socially. Learn to cook and prepare your own meals. This will establish part of the routine that Aaron was talking about. Read up on preparing diets for specific fitness goals (or post more questions here when you get to that point). This will empower you to cook for whatever your goal is, and give your routine direction. Learn about various ingredients and how they affect your nutrition (or, again, post more questions on ingredients you don't understand). This will allow your cooking to satiate your appetite better, and give your routine greater effect. 

Skin sag entirely depends on the person, and their overall health. I've seen some people with skin sag so bad they have 'fins' underneath their arms and others that lost 100+ pounds with no noticeable sag. Some people are complete health wrecks and being overweight is just one problem; others actually have fairly good fundamentals, and just happen to be overweight. To understand this a bit more concretely, think of the difference between a long-time smoker who is obese and spends much of his/her time sick, and a sumo wrestler. If they both lost 100 pounds, skin sag would be very pronounced on the former, but not nearly so much on the latter. As for how to mitigate it, that is a very complicated question. Skin sag is very closely linked to the 'aging process'; your skin can be considered an organ, and is very sensitive to changes in your overall health. The quick, general answer is that anything you can do to increase your overall health will help alleviate skin sag. That answer, however, is supremely unhelpful due to how general it is, so let me make a short list of pointers. 

I joined, for the first time, a summer tennis league this year. I do a small amount of weight training still and would like to focus my lifting sessions more toward functional lifts that might correlate directly to tennis. My first crack at this has been to focus on more twisting style ab exerices (russian twists, for example), work in more tricep lifts at heavier weights/lower reps for explosions on overhead shots (e.g. the serve), and more forearm exercises. What else should I consider here? Note that I am looking for lifts only and not general tennis training advice. 

When it comes to knees, your only real safe bet is something in the water. Don't rule out water sports because you can't swim. You can try water volleyball, for instance. There's really no sport worth playing/doing for the purposes of weight loss that isn't going to be somewhat rough on your knees. Probably the only high intensity sport you could get away with here is doubles tennis on a very well maintained clay court. 

"Women weaken legs." -- Mickey from Rocky I I've often heard and have been told from coaches even that one should abstain from any sexual activity, irrespective of whether it is manual or with a partner, before an athletic event. Is there any physiological reason for this advice or if said advice is being given only so that the male athlete stays mentally focused. Are there effects on testosterone levels that are significant enough to affect athletic performance? Does sex really make your legs weak? Is the effect of sex/orgasms on athletic performance even measurable due to other variables like nutrition, sleep, mood, etc. etc.?
