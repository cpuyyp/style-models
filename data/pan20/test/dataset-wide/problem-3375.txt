The usual term for this is diglossia, a word that seems to have first been used for this purpose in Greek to refer to the distinction between the spoken Demotic language and the literary Khatharevousa. The linked Wikipedia article provides several examples, but the one I'm most familiar with is Arabic -- there are many regional spoken varieties that are different enough in phonology and grammar as to form several mutually unintelligible groups, but the written form, so-called "Modern Standard Arabic" (MSA), is less divergent as it tends to be standardized in a form close to Classical and Qur'anic Arabic, and is considered one language. People do also use MSA in some spoken contexts, like reading aloud, speeches or news reports, and many higher-register words used in all contexts in the spoken languages are spoken with an approximation of the MSA phonemes rather than having the form one would expect from the regular sound changes that occurred in everyday words. 

The answer to your question definitely seems to be "yes". However, finding clear-cut examples has been difficult for me (though I would imagine that there are a number of them). It is of course often difficult to draw a line between independent words and bound clitics, or between articles and demonstratives. Among the well-known European languages, languages with postposed definite markers occur in two main areas that I know of, but the difficult point is the "independent word" requirement. It seems that many argue that the Balkan-sprachbund languages have definite suffixes, not independent words (see "Romanian definite articles are not clitics", Albert Ortmann & Alexandra Popescu). (There was another question on this site about that: Why is the definite article in Balkan languages always called a suffix when it really seems to be part of the inflection?) The status of the articles in North Germanic languages seem to be similarly dubious. It seems that, for examples of postposed definite articles that are obviously independent words, we have to look at lesser-known languages. I would tentatively propose Miskito as a clear example of a language with a post-posed definite article that is an independent word; Wikipedia gives the example aras ba 'the horse'. Interestingly, in this language demonstratives precede the noun phrase, and it appears demonstratives and the article can co-occur, with the latter marking the end of a relative clause (as the article comes at the end of the noun phrase). The following example comes from Definiteness, by Christopher Lyons (p. 62): 

"Subject–verb agreement in English", by Richard Hudson, English Language & Linguistics Volume 3, Issue 2 November 1999 , pp. 173-207 There is a WALS chapter "Syncretism in Verbal Person/Number Marking" (by Matthew Baerman and Dunstan Brown) that has a brief discussion of English in the "Theoretical implications" section. 

Based on the meaning, I think it may in fact have been meant to match up with the preceding line in the book, 

Coincidentally, the page of Preliminaries to Linguistic Phonetics (1971) by Peter Ladefoged that I cited recently in my answer to Is there a voiced-unvoiced pair for R or L in any language? actually has something to say about this: 

As for the more general typological criteria for applying the concept of "subject" and "object" to a language that only uses ergative morphology and has a fully ergative syntactic system, there might be some fuzziness. I haven't studied the matter, so there might be more subtle grammatical phenomena other than morphology and pivots that we can use to identify the subject. If not, it just means that "subject" and "object" are defined at this level by mainly semantic grouping, which is not that strange for universally applied typological categories. We can distinguish them by the same vague kind of criteria that we use to distinguish "nouns", "verbs", and "adjectives". At that level of typology, these kind of "universal" classifications are often disputed if we take them to represent some important fact about the structure of all languages, but they are often felt to at least provide some rough method of inter-linguistic comparison. It's easier to remember a few terms that mean slightly different things in different languages than it is to remember a bunch of terms that are all specially designed to refer to specific features of individual languages. 

(The Proximate Phonological Unit of Chinese-English Bilinguals: Proficiency Matters, by Rinus Gerardus Verdonschot, Mariko Nakayama, Qingfang Zhang, Katsuo Tamaoka, and Niels Olaf Schiller) However, I also found this: 

The easier part first: Using Janko Gorenc's collection of numbers, I was able to find that the Indonesian and Malay word for 14 is empatbelas or empat belas (empat on its own means 4), and the Maltese word for 14 is erbatax, which are both confirmed by Wiktionary. Finding the word for eleven was much more difficult. I've found this page which claims that the language Huli of Papua New Guinea, which has a quindecimal number system, has the word bearia for eleven. Another page from the same site gives buluchib as the word for eleven in the Maya language Tzotzil, which has a vigesimal number system. There are citations linked from the site, but I can't access them directly. I also found another language where the phrase for 11 starts with b, but that's because the word for ten starts with b, and eleven is expressed as "ten on one". It's Arawak, where ten is biandakhabo and eleven is biandakhabo diazo abaro. This doesn't seem in the spirit of what you wanted, and the word is a little long to take to use in English. 

Wells would say that this violates, for no clear reason, a constraint against ending a stressed syllable in a short vowel. Compare the example mentioned in the section "The phonotactic condition": 

You're right that it's not part of the High German Consonant Shift. I don't know the exact dates, so this is not exactly an answer, but it's too long to be a comment. I wanted to post some additional information about the etymology that is relevant. W as [v] German "w", as you mentioned, is generally cognate to English "w" ([w]) and for this reason the corresponding Proto-Germanic phoneme is standardly reconstructed as [w]. German and English are standardly classified as further belonging to the "West Germanic" group specifically, so we can extend the reconstruction of [w] to Proto West Germanic. I Googled and found a book, Analysis of the Scandinavian Loanwords in the Aldredian Glosses to the Lindisfarne Gospels, by Sara M. Pons Sanz, that says North and West Germanic are thought to have split around 500 AD or later. So it seems at some point between 500 AD and modern German, there was a shift of [w] to [v]. (This is an important part of your question that I don't know the answer to.) It still patterns similarly to an approximant/sonorant in German phonology, though, and I believe that there are regions in Germany where a more approximant pronunciation [ʋ] is used. (Wikipedia says this is more common in Southern accents.) So in a way, you could say the change of the approximant /w/ to an unambiguously fricative /v/ is not fully complete across German even today. V as [f] German "v" (in native words) corresponds to Proto-Germanic *f, which we're pretty sure was a voiceless labial fricative of some sort (either [f] or [ɸ]); this developed in English to "f" and "v". In modern standard German, "v" is pronounced as [f] in native words. The explanation I remember learning for the spelling is that it represents a feature that was present in some historical dialects of leniting/voicing word-initial and intervocalic *f to [v], similar to the leniting/voicing of word-initial *s to [z] that is well-known as a feature of standard German today (a number of regional accents of German have voiceless [s] in this position, however). The Wikipedia article I linked to earlier says that there are accents of German that retain a distinction between semi-voiced or lenis f/v, from *f, and fortis f, from consonant-shifted *p. (This is similar to the constrast between intervocalic "s" and "ß" in modern standard German.) However, this phonological information doesn't seem to be enough to determine the date of voicing/lenition of /f/ to /v~v̊/, because there is evidence that the HGCS initially resulted in geminate fricatives like /ff/ intervocalically. So voicing/lenition could have applied either before the HGCS, or after it, as long as it occured at some point before the loss of consonant length (a loss that I have heard is not complete in all modern German accents) and was restricted to affecting singleton /f/, not geminate /ff/. Word-initial voicing of *f to [v] also occcured in at least some accents of Dutch (explaining the standard Dutch spelling of words like "vriend", which corresponds to the pronunciation with [v] that is present in some modern accents of Dutch, although others have voiceless [f]) and in some old accents of English (explaining the "v" in "vixen" and "vat"). However, I don't believe this voicing reflects a shared inherited feature of English, Dutch and German, but a regional tendency towards voicing word-initial as well as intervocalic fricatives (which is most robustly evident in the reflex of *þ as /d/ in both German and Dutch). Evidently, this voicing process was either reversed, or did not occur for *f in accents ancestral to modern Standard German pronunciation. Dialect mixing seems to have resulted in the rather random use of word-initial "v" vs. "f" in modern German spelling. 

Sorry, I don't know much about Hindi so I can't give a very good answer to your question. However, I would like to challenge the premises a bit. There are many languages that are not "pure". It doesn't mean that they haven't evolved. Acquiring loanwords is a form of language evolution. Obviously, many English people think of the English language first. Words like "computer" and "amusement" actually are derived from Romance (Latin-based) roots, not native English (Germanic) roots. Some people are quite proud of the fact that English words derive from many languages, and will make extravagant claims related to it that I doubt are really true, like saying that it makes English have a richer vocabulary than other languages. Some other people get a strange idea that Germanic words are always better and more expressive; the more extreme version of this idea leads to things like the "Anglish" movement where people try to write avoiding any Romance or Latin-derived words. This is quite difficult, so in a sense, you can say that native English speakers can't really speak in "pure English". But there are many other examples of "impure" modern languages, such as Japanese, where much formal and technical vocabulary is derived from Chinese. As I said, I'm not familiar with the situation with Hindi, but do the fluent news anchors you mention really switch between Hindi and English when they speak, or are they just speaking entirely in Hindi while using some loanwords that originally came from English? 

Yes, it is possible to read texts that are written only in pinyin. This is pretty trivial in one sense: pinyin spelling indicates all of the segmental phonemic distinctions of standard Putonghua Chinese (it was designed to) and when used with tone marks and correct word division and punctuation, it indicates some of the suprasegmental and intonational aspects of pronunciation as well. So someone with a pinyin text can read the sounds out loud fairly well, and if you can do that, you should be able to understand what's being said about as well as you can understand something that you hear that is not written down. In another sense, it's obviously difficult for people who are used to one spelling system to read something in an unfamiliar spelling system. /fɔr ɪgˈzæmpəl, aɪm ˈraɪtɪŋ ðɪs ˈsɛntəns ɪn ði ɪntərˈnæʃənəl fəˈnɛtɪk ˈælfəbɛt; ɪts ˈprɑbəbli ˈhɑrdər tə rid ðən ðə nɛkst ˈsɛntəns./ For example, this sentence is probably easier to read than the preceding sentence written using the International Phonetic Alphabet. But it is not impossible to read an IPA transcription of English; it just requires knowledge of the sound correspondences, and practice if you want to be able to read quickly. So this is a practical objection to replacing characters in pinyin; it doesn't mean writing comprehensible Chinese in pinyin is "absolutely impossible" in principle. And in another sense, a non-phonemic writing system allows you to get away with things that would be confusing, or even incomprehensible, in spoken language (like the "shi" poem). I found a tract calling for English spelling reform that gives the following English example: 

Besides the fact that Londres and so on originate from Latin Londinium, I unfortunately have not been able to find any dictionary entry that explains the etymology of this word and the sound changes that occurred. However, I did find a post on the Wordorigins Discussion Forum archive that gives some information: 

Is there any linguistic explanation of this? Native English words don't seem to me to have a general preference for the penultimate syllable, but I may be wrong — please tell me if there's evidence for this. It does seem to me that for many English speakers, penult stress is the default for pronouncing foreign words. For example, in the Anglicized pronunciation of words from Japanese, Japanese pitch-accent seems to be totally ignored, and penult stress is common (but not universal; see "samurai," "tycoon," and some pronunciations of "haiku" for counterexamples). Has there been any linguistic research that confirms this idea? If so, do we have any idea of the conditions under which this tendency applies to the pronunciation of a word (does it depend on apparent language of origin, phonological structure, analogy to other specific English words with the same spelling) and how long it has been active historically?
