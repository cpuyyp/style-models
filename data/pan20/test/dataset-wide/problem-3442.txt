Google and Wikipedia are your Friends... BEA was formed at the start of 1972; BEA wiki: $URL$ BLS wiki: $URL$ BLS only does labor market-related things. BEA estimates a variety of macroeconomic indices, the primary one is, of course, the GDP. 

To add to the other comments here - when you allow for free trade to prosper countries/regions tend to specialize in what they are good at producing/creating (idea of comparative advantage). This leads to better products created more efficiently. Note that this idea has no care for unemployment rates in certain countries, it simply states that as a whole we are all better off. You may have heard that some people (often unskilled laborers) are "left behind" by globalization, particularly in developed nations such as the US (think auto industry). To think like an economist these people ought to re-appropriate their efforts to developing a skill that is useful in their new environment. However, that isn't always plausible for many people, which is where you can argue that government should step in and help them learn new and useful skills (preferable to protecting an inefficient industry). Protectionism tends to dampen productivity and efficiency thus often leading to inferior goods that cost more to the consumer. 

In nearly every public school district in the U.S., one can observe the following pattern: There are fewer middle schools than elementary schools. And there are fewer high schools than middle schools. (And the count of students per school goes inversely as the count of schools.) But why is this the case? Is there any explanation for this based on economic principles? For example, why is the reverse not the case? Why are there not fewer elementary schools than high schools, let's say? 

They don't know for certain. It's an inexact science. They do the best they can. Alan Greenspan was known for pouring over all the economic data available for hours while mostly in the bathtub trying to make sense of what was happening in the economy. But ultimately, it came down to making an informed decision based on knowledge, reasoning, experience and intuition. Policy objectives (which are quasi-political) can also come into play as sometimes desired results can compete. The classic example of this is economic growth vs. inflation. Critics of government monopolized central banks argue that it is impossible for any single individual or group of policy makers to choose rates correctly and overnight interbank lending rates should be allowed to float freely and be determined by the market vis-a-vis supply-demand equilibrium. Hence the popularity of LIBOR and to a lessor extent EURIBOR as these are closer to market pricing than, say, the Fed Funds Rate. However, these are still only averages of central bank policy decision and, therefore, are not purely market-driven. 

Government behavior/actions play a big role in economics, but economic study certainly isn't constrained by "arbitrary" political forces. As @dismalscience pointed out in his comment, the existence of black markets points towards the drive towards a market-based system no matter the laws or political systems of a given country. Rather than picture economics as a derivative of a set of laws, picture the laws and political systems as being constructs to help shape the underlying economic system (to correct market failures, etc.). The goal and job of those that study economics is to help explain how all of these moving forces interact with one another. Also, in the comments it is asked why we need economic theory to set prices if it is achievable through "common sense." We don't need economic theory necessarily to set the price, but rather to understand why the price is set, what led to a given price, and how might the price change in the future. The example used of grocery store prices was used for simplicity, but certainly you could imagine far more complex economic interactions where a solid economic theory would come in quite useful (think international trade, wall street, the labor market of the EU, etc.). 

Price elasticity of demand is related (but not equal) to the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. This Wikipedia article defines PED as: 

Corporations are essential and they do provide benefits to the overall economy. Corporations are essential in the sense than individuals, when given the freedom to choose, do choose to invest their capital in corporations. And these corporations, in turn, use this capital to produce products and services which other people voluntarily purchase. Corporations are a net benefit to the economies in which they operate because they produce products which customers voluntarily purchase for prices which allow the corporations to return a profit to their shareholders. To the extent there are exceptions to this vis-a-vis crony corporations and government subsidies, the previous paragraph is notwithstanding. 

Economists have been exploring control theory applications to macro economics for decades. For example, here is a 40 year-old research paper written in 1976 on the topic. 

I would use the Federal Reserve Economic Database (Fred) from the St. Louis Fed: $URL$ I know they have the Lerner Index and the Boone Indicator by country. Just do a search for it and you get a list of various datasets that you can download to excel, csv, etc. Hope that helps! 

There has been some papers and articles put forth from the IMF over the last few years suggesting that Austerity has caused many European economies to drag and not recovery from the great recession as well as they otherwise could have. I pulled the first article I found referencing the IMF research (from Washington post): $URL$ I think the largest concern with respect to expansionary fiscal policy in today's economic climate is the crowd-out effect that huge public debt can have on private investment. Perhaps someone can link a solid paper about that effect. 

It depends on whether all the tickets are sold or not. If sold out, all the the tax burden is borne by the buyers. If not, then it's shared. If sold out, buyers pay all the tax. If all 39,000 tickets are sold, then your reasoning holds correct. The revenue the owners receive with the tax will equal the income to the owners without the tax. $$R = P \cdot Q_{max}$$ Where $R$ is the total revenue from ticket sales to owners, $P$ is the average ticket price, $Q(P)$ is the total quantity of tickets sold and $Q_{max}$ is the total quantity of tickets available to be sold (39,000 in this case). $$ Q_{max} = 39,000 $$ The total amount of tax revenue received by the government will equal the total amount of taxes paid by the ticket buyers. $$T_{paid} = T_{received} = \$5 \times 39,000 = \$195,000$$ If not, the tax burden is shared. When the stadium does not sell out, then the price elasticity of demand kicks in and causes both parties to share the tax burden. Keep in mind, the ticket sellers still earn the same amount per ticket, their shared tax burden (economic loss) comes from a reduced number of ticket sales due to the increase in ticket cost paid by the ticket buyers. The reduction in ticket sales represents a cost of lost opportunity of a perishable asset (i.e., the unsold tickets). The amount the buyers, in aggregate, reduce their ticket purchases will be proportional to the price elasticity of demand. The below diagram shows the impact of taxation on ticket sales, price and quantity sold. 

I am not asking for an opinion-based answer, but a beginner's account of the technical connections between these concepts to the extent that this is possible. 

This is in line with the Encyclopedia of Health Economics formulation $$Y=X_1β_1+X_2β_2+C_oβ_o+C_uβ_u+\varepsilon\tag 1$$ where the generating true model in the equation is opaque to the researcher because of $C_u$ - an unobservable confounding variable which, unlike $C_o,$ may be suspected, but cannot be controlled for, resulting in a flawed $Y=X_1\beta_1+X_2β_2+C_o\beta_o+e$ model. In this case, if $X_1$ was correlated with $C_u,$ we could say that $X_1$ is endogenous because of the presence of an unobservable confounder. Based on this, should confounding variables be considered a type of endogenous variable? ? 

Presumably yields at the auctions are perfectly fine-tuned to meet supply and demand. Therefore, if the issue was simply an expectation of higher yields in the near future, this would have been factored in at the time of the auctions. At this point the fiscal hole of $1 trillion created by the recently enacted tax cuts is already known. Presumably, economists still see US Treasuries as risk free. And there is the "flight-to-safety" effect, which would anticipate investors fleeing the stock market to seek refuge in US Treasuries, and is seemingly absent here...
