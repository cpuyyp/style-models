[Updated from previously - RonnieW says the following is not accurate] based on what you've written, either you need to shape up, ship out (or plan to somehow find a new mentor if/when Joe leaves, although that seems unlikely). Or follow Joe to some new employer, if he wants you to. 

Anyway, try to get answers, then have a discussion with the boss; unless you figure it's time to quietly leave, in which case brush up your resume and get your interviewing shoes on, already. Appraise your performance and experience frankly, and what you want to improve. Ask the developer, if you can trust him (or else ask him after you quit, possibly over lunch). And develop a better radar for bullshit situations. 

Even more fundamentally, it's to assess the thought process behind the code. Be clear whether you're assessing (algorithmic) knowledge or coding proficiency - those are two distinct things. Tell them you're not waiting to pounce on mistakes, just to see how they approach things. Do keep it relevant to the job function, but don't ask for free consulting (as @Tim said - this does happen, with sleazy employers). Try to avoid toy problems like FizzBuzz, Towers of Hanoi, Conway's Game of Life. Pick something with more than one algorithmic component to make it immune to simple copy-and-paste. 

Not having a picture online is fine, your privacy is your own decision. However, github is a great site to showcase yourself on for CS, and it doesn't require either a picture or publicly disclosing your real name (instead it shows your username, which can be whatever you want). So, you get the best of both worlds. Consider joining it. Likewise, the main coding-competition websites. (As the others say, if you were to apply for any sort of job requiring an online presence - even community evangelist, trainer or open-source maintainer, not just outright marketing - obviously those sorts of lines of work would require one.) By the way, don't confuse "social media profile" with "professional profile" - you can't mention github and Facebook in the same sentence. Twitter is different, depending on how you use it. 

But yeah in the long run set hard limits to how much of your time he can consume, and hide behind your manager as necessary. Keep any communications with him brief and polite. EDIT: I know he's testing the limits, but try to Assume Good Faith, some assholes are redeemable, some people genuinely want to become better but don't know how. But obviously be assertive and set very hard limits on his behavior and use your manager as a shield. EDIT2: People's styles are very different. Some people are defensive in written communications, but very receptive in person. Some are the exact opposite. Some are just always a pain in the ass. Some people will take very frank feedback, if delivered in a very private setting, e.g. conversation, offsite. Some will freak out and go for your jugular. It's up to you to triage which animal you're dealing with here. If you choose to keep interacting with him. It's your call. He definitely sounds like a hard case. 

I see a very vague title "How to approach a boss who doesn't take full responsibility for his mistake?", no statement on the first line of any specific question, two paragraphs, and still no statement of any specific question. After digging into this for 15+ minutes so far, my best guess is "Missed my contract renewal deadline due to boss misstating it in email, how to respond?" The title is brutal. It sounds vague, ontological(what is "full responsibility"? Do any of us, ever...?), unrealistic, aimless. What is the actionable issue right now: are you looking for how to get the contract renewed, manage the relationship, a full and frank appraisal of his personality, or tips on how to manage this sort of email communication better in future, or is this a legal question in disguise ("What happens to a person on a fixed-term contract in Jurisdiction expiring on Date if the renewal deadline is misstated to them? Can they legally hire my replacement?") Presumably you're looking for all of the above, but you need to prioritize for us: Which single most important change do you want to achieve, and by when? When you say there's a "deadline", is that what your contract actually says, or is that the date they request you respond for their internal decision-making/hiring process? In the current scheme of things, if you don't renew, when do they actually stop paying you? This Friday, or in 3 months' time, or what? Advertising/interviewing for your replacement is one thing, but laying you off/ending your contract is a different thing. Say you did miss fall semester, can you come back in winter semester? Would you want to? Is there any continuity issue? If it's a legal question then every significant detail is missing: what country and state are you in, do you have a contract, what does it say about renewals, deadlines, acceptances, is this deadline the same for other depts, did you ask around how do these guys generally handle late renewals, does your boss mess up like this before, if so what happened, and so on. "I was trying to keep my options open and reply to him a week or two before the deadline, but obviously this is an issue now. How should I bring this up to my boss?" Well, sorry, your time's up. So was your decision to renew, or leave? Or are you still unsure and trying to buy extra time to interview/negotiate compensation? Or are you asking us to tell you what to decide? Either way, your time's up and you have to make a decision, presumably now. EDIT: I mean, you could tell them you're renewing, while still interviewing and planning to leave. If that's what you want to do, and any possible repercussions, it's on you. What does "apparently" mean in "apparently the email in question contained an error on the deadline"? Either there was an error, or there wasn't, or you don't know and you're relying on (your coworker's?) opinion? Who, other than your boss, can confirm basic important things like that? His boss, HR, or who? There must be somebody else. You just casually toss in "Although I would prefer electronic contact, the boss seems to like to keep his employees 'on edge' and doesn't always answer emails he reads." Assuming you brought that up because if causes you grief and you want solutions, it's up to you to learn some effective techniques to deal with people like that (whether they're shy, flaky, or actively dishonest). Like, send a brief dated memo to the guy summarizing your discussion (or else your understanding), for important things. If his personality really annoys you that much ongoing, then quit, already. You can't change it; at most you might be able to privately give him constructive suggestions after all this mess is sorted out; I doubt that'll have much effect. (Or maybe he's under some budgetary pressures you don't know about. But still.) There are some well-known techniques for dealing with flaky, uncommunicative or dysfunctional people: calendar a 1-on-1 meeting. Say, every month or two. Even for 15 minutes. Also, in emails, state a default course of action: "I plan to to do X unless I hear otherwise from you by Date". If this is an assertiveness issue, there are some good courses, audiobooks etc. Perhaps you might find them beneficial. You also threw in this "Apparently(?) email in question contained an error; deadline ... supposed to be two weeks ago. I do not know the details of the discussion between coworker and boss, but it was a heated debate... I don't think it's a good idea to mention how I found out about the error" Then don't. Just say/write "Boss, I understand my contract renewal date was actually X, but I did not get notified of that timely/until Date/now. I'd urgently like to discuss my renewal with you, by Date." I'm seeing lots of signals that weird me out, like your boss's communications suck, he missed the deadline by a lot, you only accidentally found out because your coworker talked to him, he never even notified you after he realized, the "heated discussion" sounds like he blamed coworker, you're not supposed to know about that conversation with coworker, so effectively he's still never communicated with you about the renewal, or maybe he doesn't want to renew you, your job satisfaction sucks ("I don't think I will get fired because I'm relatively difficult to replace"), and even given all of this, you still can't make your mind up. What % of your boss's written or verbal communications are not dysfunctional? This is really a dysfunctional setup. Were you looking for advice on that or not? We honestly can't tell. These are the sorts of things that would make many conclude this is a rant, not a specific actionable question, or list of questions. Are you as frustrated as most of us would be? Because managing to belatedly fix this contract renewal isn't going to fix the ton of other things that you complain about. What is the case for quitting? You haven't articulated one positive reason you want to stay there. 

But it's not, based on anything you've said! Anyway it's not your perception that matters as to whether it's a problem. Don't let your ego be threatened, don't feel insecure. tl;dr: Rejoice, let it go, use it to your career advantage, keep them happy while nudging them towards a mutually useful point, boost their managerial self-esteem 

For whatever reason, the company knowingly stiffed Joe on a bonus he deserved. Bob perpetrated this, and George approved it. Dishonest culture. Most us of have seen this go down. [update: you say this was an isolated incident and the culture is good.] All this hierarchical nonsense about saying "Bob knows he deserves it and that it was unfair, but doesn't have any actual authority. The only person with authority is a remote senior manager". Any company which plays games like this is dishonest. Has it always been like this or has there been bozocreep? "Bob wasn't aware that Joe would leave over the bonus... but appreciated me bringing it up". Now you're getting sucked into the dysfunction and dishonesty. As others said, how on earth do you know Bob was being honest with you? Whether Joe is actually interviewing and preparing to leave, is your guess, and you gossiping, even behind closed doors, is not ok. Multiple people here told you. Even if, Joe will eventually find out at some point, and I can't see how that will be positive for you. Mind your own business. Given Joe made the judgment call not to raise it with either Bob, George or anyone else, who are you to decide he was wrong? In particular if he figured doing so may be putting a "target on his back", then you already might suspect the culture's rotten. What possesses you to believe you can singlehandedly fix that? Chances are Joe is smarter than you. Be honest with us about the reason you felt compelled to intervene. Was it the general principle (we doubt it), personal loyalty to Joe, concern that the company culture is getting bad, or your naked self-interest about how you'll get on after he's gone? I think your most telling statement was "He helps me out on a daily basis, and from a selfish point of view, I would hate to see him leave." So, is all this your disguised crypto fear for your own job security when Joe leaves? Truth? [update: you said you're doing fine, you're not weak, marginal or insecure. In that case, it's disappointing, but not your problem] Forgetting about Joe for a minute, if your company culture is/has become so bad, why do you stay there? [update: you say it's actually good] Is this simply a case of hiring one bozo senior manager, or has the company gone terminally bad? Are you not capable of getting a job elsewhere? Maybe you're not. Maybe Joe is the only reason you still have a job. Or maybe not. But be honest with us about how it actually is. Not this phony concern for Joe. None of us buy it. "If Joe does leave, the damage done to the company (I estimate tens of thousands of dollars) will be far more than the cost of the bonus (a few thousand)." Either that's true (in which case they're seriously clueless/greedy/ dishonest), or it's self-delusion clouded by your own insecurity or selfishness. If anything, this is more proof that the culture is rotten, the managers are dishonest, bozos or spineless wimps [update: you say this is totally not the case]. Which brings us back to: what are you doing to change the culture (does any manager listen to you?), or why aren't you also leaving? These are the problems you're not solving. Ratting out Joe isn't helpful or ethical. Conclusion: [update] Companies do bad things all the time, you just have to accept it unless you're prepared to quit in protest, which you're not. Likely you will never find out what the real issue between Joe and his management was (maybe they already figured he's leaving, possibly to a competitor, and just decided to stiff him on the way out to teach the rest of you a lesson, or claw back bonus for the bonus pool - those are two of many possible scenarios). Unless he tells you subsequently. But stop talking to them about him behind his back. If he does quit and there's a departmental outcry, then observe carefully who says what and what happens, if anything. Often, it will not go down the way you imagined, and people will be more governed by their own self-interest. Employees can be just as disloyal and selfish as managers. The bottom line is, the culture is very clearly broken and you can't fix it on your own. 

It depends entirely who 'others' is, their attitude towards/knowledge of SO, and the context in which this conversation is happening. It's one thing to be asked in an interview "Tell us your top-ten resources for getting your work done and why?" It's entirely another thing to be asked "Why are you constantly surfing to all these third-party sites, some of which (e.g. Careers.SO) appear to be jobsites? Aren't you working?" If 'others' means managers, then never tell a non-technical manager (or higher-up) "I spend some time at work asking or answering code-related questions on another website". Also, legal types will often wet their pants at the prospect of disclosure or code/ license/ IP tainting. The less open-source-friendly the company, the higher the danger. As to developers, some sneer at SO (in some cases, with good reason). Most developers have a backchannel of personal contacts, mailing-lists, forums, user groups, chat channels, even Twitter followers, where they can more quickly source very high-quality opinions or recommendations, without the drama and narrow scope restrictions of SO. Ever tried to ask for a package recommendation on SO? Tough. A purchase recommendation? Tough. A semi-objective question which nevertheless calls for years of experience from your audience? Tough. All will be gleefully closed with the snarktastic putdowns which have made SO, ahem, notorious - in some language communities worse than others. There are, of course, also developers who find SO useful. So, know your audience before you tell them. As to non-technical types, I can't see how SO would ever even come up in conversation, other than "I/My kid wants to learn to code/ script MineCraft/ program a home controller/ program Hangman etc. How do you do that?" 

There may or may not be a problem here, and they may well just be enthusiastic for him joining; generally a little bit of preparation is standard for the industry. He should reply to the manager's email to clarify exactly what their expectation of his JS/JQ abilities on day one and the first few weeks. At what point is he maintaining code? committing new code? fixing bugs? writing unittests? What are their general plans for the site/product? Yes agreed they should give him a good first week of work to ease into the work and learn what is required. In general it's always a good question to have asked in interviews "What will my tasks be in the first 15/30/90/365 days?" (ask that of multiple people and compare the answers to see if you see any alarm-bells/ conflict/ lack of clarity/unrealistic estimates). (It shouldn't come down to week one to see if they're slavedrivers, lunatics, workaholics, stressbunnies, deathmarch zombies or decent people. He should have developed a sense of this in the interview process.) So, after he clarifies their expectation, only then can he judge if it's a reasonable request or not:
