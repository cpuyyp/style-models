The equivalence principle (postulated by Einstein) states that gravitational and inertial mass are the same ($URL$ So, even if you could create an artificial gravity field in your spaceship, the inertial mass of objects within that field would not change. To reduce the inertial mass you would need to have a machine that actually changes the true gravitational mass. 

You want a hot Eyeball planet. Tidally-locked (like mentioned above), with a thin atmosphere to avoid efficient heat redistribution and not too much water. See here or here. There can be some variety too. Here is an image of the possible climates on Proxima b (from climate models). Details here or here. 

The planet is likely to be tidally-locked, which would create a dichotomy between the hemispheres. That could make it an "Eyeball planet" (see here). There are several different flavors of Eyeball planets (see here): the best place for life can be along the terminator (in permanent sunset/sunrise) or the illuminated or dark sides depending on the planet's atmosphere and water content (see here for the example of Proxima). 

A Jupiter-mass black hole orbits a Sun-like star in the classical habitable zone, with an Earth-like "moon" orbiting the black hole. Earth orbiting a brown dwarf. Brown dwarfs don't burn hydrogen so they simply cool off in time. However, there is a set of orbits for which there is a billion-year window of goldilocks conditions (see here: $URL$ A planet in the habitable zone of a white dwarf. I suppose it's semantics whether a white dwarf counts as a star or not. It's a bit more speculative, but how about a planet that is free-floating within a star cluster that receives a pulse of energy every time it flies by some bright stars, then spends the next 10,000 years cooling off slowly. Whether this is viable would depend on the nature of the planet's atmosphere, how close it flies to what types of stars, etc. But not impossible. 

Imagine Mercury with more water. This would create an atmosphere of water vapor. If there was a lot of water the planet would get a thick water atmosphere and have a runaway greenhouse and turn into a steamball (see here: $URL$ With a modest amount, water would likely simply be transported to cold traps and freeze out, like in craters or at the poles or on the night side of the planet. Since the planet is in 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, its day is about 59 days (its orbit is 88 days). I can imagine a really interesting setup. There are 3 source of water on a wetter (but not too wet) Mercury: 1) randomly-located ice deposits in large craters; 2) permanent cold traps at the poles; and 3) a cold trap on the night side that migrates across the planet as the planet rotates. I'm not sure whether this migrating cold trap would persist but it's an interesting idea. It would be sort of like an Eyeball planet (see $URL$ but one that is constantly changing as the planet slowly spins. Life on such a planet? Well, where there is water on Earth there is life. So, I think it's totally plausible to imagine life in two places: at ice deposits (permanent or migrating/temporary) and in the subsurface, also in water-rich areas. 

The habitable zone is so close-in for very red stars that your planet will be tidally locked and always show the same face to the star. That means that the Sun doesn't actually move in the sky at all. 

There is also the possibility of maintaining liquid water somewhere other than a planet's surface. For instance, several Solar System bodies are thought to have long-lived subsurface oceans: Europa, Ganymede, and Ceres are the most promising. The phrase "goldilocks zone" makes the assumption that the only relevant quantity is the orbital distance to one or more stars. But there is no need to be so restrictive. Here are a few examples of situations that answer the question: 

First -- K stars are just a little redder and fainter than the Sun. There is no problem having rocky planets in the habitable zone. And the habitable zone can fit as many planets as around other stars (see here for details: $URL$ Second -- there is no issue having 4 planets in the habitable zone. The inner edge for an Earth-like planet is reasonably well-defined as being at about 0.9-0.95 AU (for Sun-like stars, can be adjusted with a simple scaling factor for fainter/brighter stars), but the outer edge is extremely fuzzy and can extend out almost indefinitely. This is just because it's easier to provide energy to a planet's surface (e.g., through a thick atmosphere that retains heat) than to cool it off very fast. Third -- in terms of orbital spacing, you can easily fit 4 planets in the habitable zone. Earth and Venus are relatively closely spaced (semimajor axis ratio of 1.4, orbital period ratio of about 1.7). If you take a look at systems with small (presumably rocky) planets around other stars, they tend to be as close to each other (or closer than) the Earth-Venus separation. This plot shows some Kepler candidate planets (all smaller than 1.5 Earth radii). The x axis is logarithmic, so the distance between planets depends on the orbital ratios (not the absolute differences). I included a shrunk-down Solar System as comparison (the separations are preserved in the shrinking): 

Here is an idea: use a micro black hole to trigger an orbital instability in the planetary system. Planetary systems tend to form on the edge of stability, such that relatively small perturbations can destabilize them. What happens is this: small kicks change the planets' orbits and make them cross. In systems with just rocky planets, this would lead to giant collisions between the planets. Bad for any life on those planets. 

These two worlds are not "Earth-like" but they do maintain liquid water. With these two worlds there is no "goldilocks zone" of required orbits, there is just a zone that is disallowed too close to any stars. Basically, it can't get too hot. FYI, see these two links for details about worlds 1 and 2: $URL$ $URL$ 

Earth's orbit would not be affected significantly by Mars' disappearance. However, a similar thought experiment would turn out quite differerently. If Earth disappeared, Venus' orbit would become unstable, and Venus would either fall into the Sun or perhaps collide with Mercury (a collision with Mars is unlikely). This is because Venus' orbit is located at an unstable "secular resonance" with Jupiter, where Venus' orbit should precess at the same rate as Jupiter's. This would cause Venus' orbit to become extremely stretched out (i.e., its orbital eccentricity would increase drastically). Grvitational kicks from Earth actually prevent Venus from falling into this resonance (called the nu_5 fyi). But if Earth disappeared, Venus would enter the resonance, have its orbit stretched out, and probably fall onto the Sun. FYI, this was only discovered in 1998 (original paper downloadable here: $URL$ 

The simplest answer I can think of is clouds. One can easily imagine planets that are covered in clouds (like Venus, except with habitable conditions under the clouds). Another possibility is that other nearby stars can prevent night from falling on some planets. This might happen in very dense clusters of stars called globular clusters (as well as in Isaac Asimov's Nightfall). Planets in multiple-star systems can also --in some cases -- have long periods without night. For example, I built a 5-Sun ($URL$ in which a planet had 8 years without night ( see $URL$ 

Let's talk about S-type orbits, where a planet's orbit around its star is smaller than the mutual orbit of the two stars. There is an outer edge of stability: planet orbits that are wider than a certain distance are unstable. That distance is directly linked to the closest approach between the two stars, Rmin. The ballpark number is generally 1/3: orbits start to be stable at about 1/3 of Rmin. So, if the two stars' closest approach is 30 AU, planetary orbits are stable out to about 10 AU. This is not a really firm number, because it depends to some degree on things like the stars' masses, how eccentric the stars' orbit is, and how inclined the stars' orbit is relative to the plane of the planets. But it's a good ballpark number. So, for your case of a binary separated by 20 AU, you could plausibly have planets orbiting both stars out to, say, 6-7 AU. If you want to be conservative put the edge at 5 AU. If the stars have different masses, then the more massive star can have planets farther out. If the binary orbit is eccentric, say with e=0.5, then the closest approach distance would be 20 AU * (1 - e) = 10 AU, so the outer edge for stable orbits would be at around 3 AU. Of course, you can pack as many planets as you want interior to that radius (see here for example: $URL$ You could also have planets orbiting exterior to the two stars, on P-type orbits. The ballpark criterion for planets on P-type orbits is that the inner edge of stability is at least 2 times the maximum separation of the two stars. So, for the case of your binary separated by 20 AU, you could have planets orbiting past ~40 AU (or, to be conservative, past ~50 AU). If your binary has an eccentricity of 0.5, then the farthest separation of the two stars would be 20 AU * (1 + e) = 30 AU, so you could have planets anywhere past 60-ish AU. Again, there are lots of details but this is the simple ballpark way to think about it. And FYI see here for a summary of the effect of binary stars on planets: $URL$ This figure shows the punchline:
