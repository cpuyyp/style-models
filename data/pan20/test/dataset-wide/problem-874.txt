As for solving the equation, $dP/dt=K/P^{5/3}$ is a separable differential equation. See the first section here. Google also brings up several pages describing how to solve such equations. In particular, we rewrite the equation in differential form as: $$P^{5/3}\, dP = K\, dt.$$ Loosely speaking, I've cleared the denominators, with a goal to get the $P$ stuff all together on one side, and the $t$ stuff on the other. Technically it's not that at all, but pretending like it is works out. I am implicitly assuming that $K$ does not depend on $P$, which your post supports. Now we integrate both sides: $${3\over8}P^{8/3}=\int P^{5/3}\, dP = \int K\, dt,$$ where we let the right hand integral cover the constant of integration. So our solution is $$P=\left({8\over3}\int K\, dt \right)^{3/8},$$ with initial condition setting the constant of integration. Note I took an 8th root in finding $P$, so we need the inside function to be nonnegative. Your post suggests $K$ is independent of time, in which case $\int K\, dt= K t+C$ for some constant $C$ which is determined by the initial conditions. If it does depend on time, you have to do the integration accordingly, or use data to estimate it. 

You are probably thinking of a pair-instability supernova. Such a supernova releases more energy than the star's gravitational binding energy, completely disrupting the star and dispersing the contents. Meaning that with nothing else in the universe, over infinite time every particle from the star will get infinitely far away from any/every other particle. The mass, energy, etc. of the star doesn't vanish from the universe, though; it just gets spread throughout it. But there will be no dense remnant left behind: no dwarf, no neutron star, no black hole; over long time scales there won't even be a discernible nebula remaining (though note the star may have shed off significant amounts of material prior to this event, which would interact with the ejecta and may result in some sort of permanent structure suggesting a star used to be there).

A wormhole, or Einstein-Rosen bridge, is inherently unstable. It will collapse before anything can traverse it. Keeping it stable enough for even a photon to get through requires negative energy densities. And that requires exotic and suspicious new physics in most cases. Technically there are well-known effects which can produce negative energy densities, such as the Casimir effect. But being able to harness such an effect to stabilize a wormhole is beyond current technology (to say nothing of creating the wormhole in the first place). We have no observational evidence to suggest wormholes exist, especially not on the scales you see in Sci-Fi. So in the rapidly collapsing case it looks like nothing except possibly a spray of subatomic particles (which you might not even know aren't the usual background ones), and in the stable case it's impossible to say because you'd have to know what the exotic matter or other negative densities look like. As for what it's like to traverse a stable wormhole, as long as the exotic matter doesn't mess with you then it would be pretty much the same as any other spaceship travel. You could just have interesting time travel effects and beat light rays that went around the wormhole. A number of these are mentioned on the wiki page. 

Stan has essentially answered this in his comment, which I will attempt to spell out a little more laboriously. The significant majority of our Sun's energy output comes from the proton-proton chain. This was advocated by Eddington back in the 1920's, but at that time your basic concern was a very real and major problem. Objects with like electrical charges repel each other. In particular, protons will repel other protons since all protons have a positive charge. What they knew of the sun then indicated that the core was far too cold for protons to overcome this repulsion—at least not even remotely close to the rate that was obviously necessary to produce a brightly shining sun. With the development of quantum mechanics it was determined that a process known as quantum tunneling would give two protons a non-zero probability of "overcoming" this repulsion. But not in the sense of they just suddenly gain enough energy (hence why "overcoming" is in quotations). Instead, in the sense that the "fused together" state has the same energy as the "just about to repel each other before fusion can occur" state, and they just randomly switched from the latter to the former, despite every intermediate stage between the two of them requiring more energy than is available. That this is possible is one of the many non-intuitive features of quantum mechanics, and I think it would be beyond the scope of this question (and site) to try to get much more precise. Still, even this failed to explain why our sun was very obviously fusing atoms to the extent that it was. If you fuse two protons together, you are left with an incredibly unstable state: the diproton. As soon as one of these forms it pretty much immediately breaks up into two distinct protons. In the late 30's Hans Bethe (a man who eventually won the Nobel prize and was a part of the Los Alamos team that developed the atom bomb) proposed that yet another random quantum mechanical event would save the day: beta decay, a feature of the recently discovered fundamental force known as the weak force. In this situation one of the protons in the diproton undergoes a beta decay into a neutron before the diproton separates, at which point you have a stable deuterium nucleus: one proton, and one neutron. That so many unlikely events have to occur for two protons to produce one deuterium is the reason why the sun's lifetime is approximately 10 billion years. That the sun shines as bright as it does is, as you suggest, a sheer numbers game: there are truly prodigious numbers of protons in the sun's core, so even though the proton-proton chain is really unlikely, we have so very many chances at it that there is a great many successful fusion events. Basically every other stellar fusion reaction proceeds much more rapidly than those that produce deuterium. You may be familiar with the hydrogen bomb, which fuses its fuel very rapidly. One of the key differences (and there are many) between the hydrogen bomb and a star like our sun is that the bomb is fusing together deuterium (and tritium) into helium, and is not using the proton-proton chain. Stars have to produce large supplies of deuterium directly, and this is a lengthy process that consumes roughly 90% of a star's life—even for very massive stars, whose lifespans are orders of magnitude shorter than our Sun's. (Note that very massive stars are rather more complicated beasts, in fact, but this is again beyond the scope of this question) 

By model time of about 120,000 years, Saturn and Jupiter are rebounding back out into the outer solar system, to much the same distances we see today, scattering most of the planetesimals that remained in the areas that would become Mars and the asteroid belt. This leaves a fairly dense disc of material for Earth, Venus, and Mercury to form and grow from, while leaving significantly less for Mars, and lesser still for the asteroid belt. The whole 10 second movie covers a model time of 600,000 years. 

EDIT: Einstein@Home recently made the following announcement about a gamma ray pulsar that was detected via the program; it includes links to a published article on the detection, including an arxiv version link if you find the official publication is behind a paywall. So that's a concrete, published, and current discovery in astrophysics. If you're willing to give SETI some of the credit for having spawned the @Home style of distributed computing projects in science, as suggested above, then there you go. 

The logarithm is there because the ratio $O/H$ is really tiny. The log converts essentially points out the order of magnitude. If we have $O/H= 10^{-14}$, then $\log(O/H)=-14$. Taking logarithms is a standard practice in science and mathematics when the numbers range over several orders of magnitude (especially so when they are either very large or very small). As for the +12, that is most likely because they want their preferred example to have value 0. It is then easy to tell at a glance if other stars/galaxy have more ($>0$) or less ($<0$) oxygen-to-hydrogen metallicity than the preferred example. In most cases this will be our own Sun, but without knowing where you saw this it's impossible to say for certain. We have far more information about our own sun than any other star, so it is the most reliable measuring stick we have for comparison. Indeed, the value tells you approximately how many of orders of magnitude more or less metallicity it has. For, supposing $\log(O_\mbox{sun}/H_\mbox{sun}))=-12$, then $$\log(O/H)+12 = \log(O/H)-\log(O_\mbox{sun}/H_\mbox{sun})) = \log\left(\frac{O/H}{O_\mbox{sun}/H_\mbox{sun}}\right).$$ So if the value of this is 1, then you know the star in question has an $O/H$ ratio $10^1=$ten times that of our sun. Similarly, if it were $-3$, then the star in question would have an $O/H$ ratio that is $10^{-3}=1/1000$-th that of our sun's (or, equivalently, that our sun's ratio is $1000$ times larger). A value of $0$ means the ratios are the same. 

Ultimately this is a highly theoretical question, and while appropriate here you may find perusing the Physics site helpful to get deeper answers. But here's the basic idea for how I think about this. It's based on asking "where else would the information be?" Imagine the universe is a 2-dimensional sheet. A piece of paper, say. And that's all there is for things inside this universe: no desk it's sitting on, no air around it, etc. Whatever inhabitants of this universe wish to talk about must be contained within this 2-dimensional sheet of paper. Now imagine there is a hole in this paper. What can in-universe inhabitants possibly use to learn about this hole and whatever properties it might have? What to us, as outside observers is "the hole" is inaccessible to them: it's not part of the paper (it's an absence of paper). But the border of that hole is accessible to them. So whatever information this hole conveys to this universe must be accessible through that border, and the border only: anything else either doesn't exist, or is some distance away. The hole in this paper is our analogue for the black hole in our universe. "The inside" of a black hole doesn't make sense to an external observer, because the universe—the sheet of paper— ends at the border of the hole. There literally is no inside to speak of. The analogy gets complicated a bit by the fact that if you are not an external observer, but are infalling, then you can in fact pass through what the external observer calls the border. There's the whole information paradox as well when we bring in quantum mechanics. But this is the basic gist of things: the black hole is a topological/geometric defect (as general relativity is a theory about the geometry and topology of space), and the only "part" of it which is contained in our universe is its border, the event horizon. The actual physics at and near the event horizon is still a matter of significant debate and research. This little exercise does not explain why the information of the No-hair theorem is accessible, but nothing else is, for example. It just offers some intuition about why whatever information is accessible must, in some sense, be stored "on" the event horizon. As far as external observers are concerned, that's the only place it ever could be! 

A lot of the naming conventions were originally "because they remind us of things we already called this", or simply "tradition". How we name things has slowly but surely adjusted with time as more objects were found, and a more robust classification system was needed. Imagine it like having bins to sort your toys into. If you have a small number of balls, perhaps you'd stick them all into a single bin called "balls". But as you get more and more balls, you find they no longer fit into that bin. Looking at them, you notice they are all either quite small, or quite large. So you make two bins: small balls and large balls. Or maybe you notice they are all either very soft (stuffed or Nerf versions, perhaps), or very hard (baseballs, for example). So you could have a "soft balls" and "hard balls" bins. Keep collecting ever more balls, and you may need three, four, etc. boxes to fit them all in. And each time you will naturally try to order them so that each box contains balls that are similar to each other: these are all soft and green, these are all hard and white, these are all big and bouncy, etc. This applies equally well to all sorts of collections: baseball cards may start all together, but then get sorted into teams and years or even individual players as a collection gets very large, and so on. This is basically what's happened as we've classified and reclassified objects we've found in our solar system. We started with a small number of objects, but as we found more and more of them it became too unwieldy to stick them all together, so we started to separate them more and more. Ceres was labeled a planet because it seemed like a tiny version of, but otherwise very similar object to, existing planets. Then we eventually discovered there are a lot of things in the same general orbital region as Ceres, and if those were to also be planets then we'd soon have a gigantic list of planets. Since all these objects seemed pretty similar, and came from the same general region, they were given their own class of objects: asteroids. Pluto was labeled a planet due in part to some initial errors in the data that suggested it was larger than it actually is. Despite a growing number of oddities about it that made it look increasingly un-planet-like, tradition left it as a "planet"; it wasn't particularly problematic for this one little odd-ball to be lumped with the others. Finding a host of new, similar, and sometimes—in the case of Eris, at least—bigger objects forced a reconsideration. Incidentally, there are also comets, which are not the same as asteroids. Asteroids are rocky objects in the inner regions of the solar system. Comets are icy objects from the outskirts of the solar system: the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud, in particular. They are vaguely similar to each other: generally very small, lumpy, potato-like objects, but we noticed that asteroids were mostly rocks and metals between Jupiter and Mars, and comets were mostly ices beyond Neptune. So we separated them into their own groups. Pluto is more comet than asteroid, and likely originated from either the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud. In this case, it likely got knocked into a closer orbit via gravitational interactions with the gas giants, or possibly a star that got close enough to the Oort cloud. 

In this image we see that Jupiter hits the 2 AU mark at ~3 seconds in, corresponding to a model time of about 68,000 years. At this point you can see a dashed circle at about the 3.5 AU distance, corresponding to Jupiter's starting distance. Saturn is about 4 AU out now, having started at over 5. The third through fourth second are fairly stable-looking, with Jupiter moving in to about 1.5 AU but the other outer planets staying mostly put. But in the 5th second (~94,000 years model time)... We see Saturn make a very rapid move inwards. This is the main reason I suggest playing it slowly, as you can very easily miss it and lose track of where each solid black orbit has come from. By model time 98,000 years (still in the 5th second of the video time), Saturn has already come to within about 2 AU of the Sun; Jupiter is still about 1.5 AU, and there is a thick concentration of mostly rocky planetesimals within 1 AU. 

SETI@home's specific purpose deals with the radio SETI data. So they are implicitly asserting that the data they collect is expected to be useless outside of their namesake: they're specifically looking for things that are not known to occur naturally. That being said, it turns out that the SETI@home data collection is almost never active (see here on their site). It is done passively, as a piggyback collection when the Arecibo radio telescope is being used for other science projects. So if your question is "is any data useful outside of SETI actually collected while SETI(@home) is gathering data?", then the answer is "yes". Now, we can also note that one of the original goals of the SETI@home project was to prove the viability and practicality of distributed computing for scientific projects. This we can say was a resounding success, as it spawned BOINC, which serves as a distributed computing platform for a wide range of non-SETI science projects: Folding@home and Rosetta@home deal with protein folding, Einstein@home is for gravity wave detection, the now-defunct Mesenne@home was for finding Mersenne primes, and many others (my copy of BOINC specifically states that there are over 30 currently active). So if you are willing to consider the advances they spurred in distributed computing in scientific projects, and how this has impacted scientific projects inside astrophysics (or outside), then the answer is again "yes".
