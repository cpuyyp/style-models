An interesting quote regarding player $i$'s mixed strategy reflecting uncertainty among $-i$'s regarding what $i$ will do: 

You'll get different answers depending on assumptions, so the answer is maybe. Two papers come to mind. For a continuous time model, see Sannikov and Skrzypacz (2007). They show that collusion is impossible with imperfect monitoring if new information arrives continuously and actions can respond quickly in accordance with new information. A well known model using discrete time periods is Green and Porter (1984). They show that collusion is possible. Firms can sustain collusion by allowing for the possibility of price wars. 

Perhaps I have a counterexample! Let there be three messages, $m_1, m_2,$ and $m_3$, and three sender types $t_1,t_2,t_3$ where $\Pr(t=t_3)=\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$, $\Pr(t=t_2)=\frac{1}{4}$ and $\Pr(t=t_1)=\frac{1}{4}+\epsilon$. Sending $m_3$ results in a payoff $0$ for senders, we can think of it as exiting the game. The set of receiver responses to a message $m=m_1,m_2$ is $\{a,r\}$ $u_t(a,m_1)=1 > u_t(a,m_2)=\beta>u_t(r,\cdot)=0$ $u_R(t_1,m_1,a)=u_R(t_2,m_2,a)=2$, $u_R(t_3,m_i,a)=1$, $u_R(t_2,m_1,a)=u_R(t_2,m_1,a)=0$, $u_R(t_3,m_i,r)=2$, $u_R(t_1,m_i,r)=u_R(t_2,m_i,r)=1$. Then in equilibrium, all senders must obtain the same utility, correct?. Otherwise, one will imitate the other's strategy. So, the only pure strategy equilibrium is for all senders to choose $m_3$. In a pooling equilibrium on $m_1$ or $m_2$, the best response is to choose $r$. There is no pure strategy separating equilibrium except if $t_1$ and $t_2$ send $m_2$, and the receiver responds with $r$. Then $t_3$ is indifferent between all messages, because he will surely be met with payoff $0$. All of this gives the receiver payoff $\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon$ Then consider the case where $\sigma_R^{m_1}(a)=\beta$ and $\sigma_R^{m_2}(a)=1.$ Now, the senders are indifferent between sending those two messages. Then, let $\sigma_{t_3}(m_1)=\frac{\epsilon+1/4}{-\epsilon+1/2}=1-\sigma_{t_3}(m_1)$ and $\sigma_{t_i}(m_i)=1$ for $i=1,2$. Then the receiver strategy is rational. The receiver's expected utility from $m_1$ given $a$ or $r$ is 1.5. The expected utility from $m_2$ is slightly above 1.5, given $a$. So the ex ante expected payoff is above $\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon$, better than the pure equilibrium described above. Furthermore, this separation is only maintained by mixing. Any other pure strategy taken by the receiver will induce sender pooling, meaning the only a pure strategy equilibrium is when the receiver chooses $r$. I should have $\beta$s in the picture below for the lefthand side sender payoffs to $a$. I think the $\beta<1$ is the key ingredient. 

Consider the following communication game. Receiver payoffs are the second number in the pair. There are six types of senders, with payoffs given as the first element of the pairs. I will show there is a pooling equilibrium and at least two partial separations. I'm wondering what kind of techniques can be used to argue in favor of either separating equilibrium. One is sender-optimal and the other is receiver-optimal. $$\begin{array}{l*{6}{c}r} & Action \;B & Action \;L & Action\;R& Action\:LL & Action\;RR & \\ \hline type\;B & (0,3) & (1,2) & (1,2) & (2,1)& (2,1) \\ type\;L & (0,2) & (1,3) & (1,2) & (2,0) & (2,2.25) \\ type\;R & (0,2) & (1,2) & (1,3) & (2,2.25) & (2,0) \\ type\;LL & (0,1) & (1,2) & (1,0) & (2,3) & (2,1) \\ type\;RR & (0,1) & (1,0) & (1,2) & (2,1) & (2,3) \\ type\;H & (0,0) & (1,0.9) & (1,0.9) & (2,3.1) & (2,3.1) \\ \end{array}$$ Let their be a prior distribution on types $\pi$ where $$\pi(B)=.3,\pi(L)=\pi(R)=.2, \pi(LL)=\pi(RR)=.1, \pi(H)=.1.$$ In a pooling equilibrium, the receiver will take action $B$ for expected payoff $EU_2(B) = .3(3) + .4(2) + .2(1)=1.9$, edging out $EU_2(L)= .3(2) + .2(3) + .2(2) + .1(2) + .1(.9)=1.89$. However, there are partially separating equilibria. Separation 1 Let types $L,LL$ "ask" for action $L$, types $R$ and $RR$ "ask" for $R$ and then $B$ and $H$ mix 50/50 between the two signals. Let the messages be $l$ and $r$ with the natural interpretation. So $EU_2(L\mid l)\Pr(l)=.15(2) + .2(3) + .1(2) + .025(1)=1.125=EU_2(R\mid r)\Pr(r)$ So the receiver earns $2.25$ in expectation. The senders are better off too. Separation 2 But let's consider another kind of separation. Types $R$ and $LL$ always send a message $ll$, "asking" for action $LL$. Types $L$ and $RR$ send $rr$, asking for action $RR$. Again, $B$ and $H$ randomize evenly. Then, $EU_2(RR\mid rr)\Pr(rr)= .15(1) + .2(2.25) + .1(3) + .025(3.1) = .9775=EU_2(LL\mid ll)\Pr(ll).$ The expected payoff is 1.955 because each message is received half the time. Responding to $rr$ with action $R$ and $ll$ with $L$ yields a lower payoff of, so the separation, being jumbled with types $L$ and $RR$ pooling, isn't useful for taking the "correct" actions $L$ or $R$ as the receiver would like. It seems to me that this last equilibrium is more robust. There are two separating equilibrium, which require coordination. Granting that senders can coordinate, why wouldn't they coordinate in the sender-optimal way? I'm wondering if any methods exist that would refine the equilibrium set to exclude the receiver-optimal separation. The first pooling equilibrium might be said not to be neologism proof. Neologism proofness is defined in section 3 of this paper. Roughly, there must not be an additional (off path) message such, that if observed, the receiver could form beliefs and a rational strategy based on those beliefs such that all who sent the message are strictly better off relative to the proposed equilibrium and those who didn't weakly prefer the proposed equilibrium outcome. I'm guessing that won't work here, because you have to consider two neologisms ($ll$ and $rr$) at once to eliminate separation 1, which requires collusion essentially. But are there any other ideas? 

As far as I can tell, research on the economics of poverty is very empirically driven, and this is probably appropriate. What kind of economic theory has been developed though? I'd also be interested in theory of some influence too. To avoid wholly opinion-based answers, let's measure influence by how the theory directed other research or anti-poverty measures. As an example, I know papers have been written on the theory of poverty traps, but I'm not sure that concept is a contribution from theorists so much as some theorists developed a model for what might have already been an empirical observation. Are there any cases where concepts started in theory? Links to papers are good, but the question is also about history to some extent, so it would be nice if you can show a trail of this paper influenced that paper or this policy. 

Purification: A mixed strategy is a plan of action based on information not specified in the model. A fictitious long run story. Population averages, so imagine the player's being pulled from some population distribution where different types play different pure strategies. The population distribution is the mixed strategy distribution.

These are interesting models for temptation, inconsistency, etc because you can get at internal conflict by seeing a DM as the unification of multiple parts.

For industrial organization, you might try the freely available IO book by Church and Ware. I don't know the book in and out, but it includes many case studies in antitrust and more general IO topics, so you might find it useful. It's not especially technical, for better or worse, with most chapters beginning with motivating vignettes and a more talky style than most books I've used. 

Your prisoner's dilemma example only works because that is a game with dominant strategies. Osborne is correct. To be best responding to another player's strategy, as in the definition you give, I must know their strategy. In other words, I must have beliefs about what they are doing, and those beliefs must be correct. This is a strengthening of the concept of rationalizability. You make an interesting point about how you can get strange "equilibria" in games with dominant strategies. It amounts to outcome equivalent $(\sigma,\mu_1)$ and $(\sigma,\mu_2)$ where $\mu_2$ might be wrong and placing positive weight on nonrationalizable strategies. But, I have never seen a Nash equilibrium that included beliefs. The definitions I recall go, "a strategy profile $\sigma\in \Sigma$ is a Nash equilibrium if $\sigma_i\in B_i(\sigma_{-i})$..." I believe this to mean that defining the beliefs is unnecessary, because the beliefs are exactly a correct assessment of the strategy profile. Referencing, one of my books, it gives the usual definition with a Nash (1950) citation, and then goes on to discuss two underlying assumptions. One is correct beliefs and the other is rational play given those correct beliefs. 

I think the answer should be more complicated, and this won't be a complete answer at all. You are assuming that counterfeit money is forever passed along? Counterfeit money is eventually taken out of circulation, so prices shouldn't move as perfectly as you suggest. But, given this fact, we might want to think about the costs of forcing counterfeit bills out of circulation. I will direct you to this selection from the introductory paragraph of this paper by L. Smith and E. Quercioli which models counterfeiting as a game. The Economics of Counterfeiting. Smith's site says it is conditionally accepted at Econometrica. They also discuss data on pass rates. 

Given how new this paper is, I would take that as an indication that there aren't terrific estimates to measure the losses. Perhaps this owes more to data than theory. Still, you could also cook up strange models where counterfeiting alleviates money shortages, making it a good thing (e.g. everything is fiat so why not just pretend the counterfeit stuff is good too?). But that seems implausible. 

A good introductory text might be something like Preston McAfee's Introduction to Economic Analysis if you want something that might substitute for the average principles text. $URL$ There are two versions available there. I understand the earlier version might be preferable if you're already comfortable with math. From the beginning of the 2006 draft: "This book presents introductory economics (“principles”) material using standard mathematical tools, including calculus. It is designed for a relatively sophisticated undergraduate who has not taken a basic university course in economics. It also contains the standard intermediate microeconomics material and some material that ought to be standard but is not. The book can easily serve as an intermediate microeconomics text. The focus of this book is on the conceptual tools and not on fluff. Most microeconomics texts are mostly fluff and the fluff market is exceedingly overserved by $100+ texts. In contrast, this book reflects the approach actually adopted by the majority of economists for understanding economic activity. There are lots of models and equations and no pictures of economists." 

Ariel Rubinstein tends to be insightful regarding these kinds of questions. He addresses the interpretation of mixed strategies in section 3 of this paper. A few possible interpretations aside from deliberate randomization: 

For stochastic processes and calc, Dixit's The Art of Smooth Pasting is written for the econ audience. 

There is a type of protection called a liability rule, where I, $A$, can take something from $B$, if I pay the damages $c$ which are court-ordered preemptively. Copyright law is all about liability rules. If the damages are correlated with $B$'s valuation appropriately, then efficiency holds. You are interested in the opposite case. If IP law doesn't get it right, this would be an example matching your hypothetical as I understand it. And some might say this is justified. A company might want to keep some research under wraps to prevent competitors from also using it and making it even more valuable to society through investment. So the expiration of a patent might fit this scenario in a roundabout way too if we start the model where the company already owns the patent and a court is deciding when to let it expire.

A producer won't always want the retail outlets to compete on price. This is the reason for minimum resale price maintenance. By competing on price, it may be that the retailers competition amounts to something closer to a zero-sum game. Supposing there are some consumers who value something like service, it might be better for joint profits to provide good service and thus bring in new consumers. You might imagine two stores selling electronics. The stores might find it best to cut price to pull the customers away from the other. The producer would rather there be good service, display models, helpful employees, etc to bring in new customers. Reference: Winter (1993) 

Consider a game of delegation. An uninformed principal must delegate some task to an informed agent with preferences imperfectly aligned. I'm aware of plenty of literature that studies these kinds of problems when there is a continuous action space, Alonso and Matouschek (2008) for example. Their lit review also seems to feature papers with continuous spaces. Quadratic loss utilities are very popular. Are there any papers featuring delegation of a decision which is constrained to some discrete space? Do qualitative results change? 

If we take the definition of monotonicity to be if $x\geqq y$ then $x \succeq y$, you can simplify the proof (though it looks right). Note $\mathbf{0}\leq x$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}_+^l$. So by the definition of monotonicity (essentially replacing $y$ with $\mathbf{0}$ above), $x\succeq \mathbf{0}$. I don't think continuity is required (check lexicographic preferences to see it is not necessary for the stated result). 

Think of it this way. A yacht costs $\$0.01$. How much do you demand? Then double the price. Now how many would you demand? Then consider something closer to a market price. Something in 6 or 7 figures I guess. If you've got some money, you might buy one at the market price. But then if that price doubles, wouldn't that affect your demand a lot more than the 1 to 2 pennies change? Simply put, as you go up the demand curve, the same percentage change in price is a much bigger absolute movement in price. 

Price discrimination is generally welfare ambiguous. Basic example: A monopoly can price discriminate between two market segments. In segment A, there is one consumer with a willingness to pay of $\$1$ million and there are one million consumers with a willingness to pay of $\$1$. In segment B, there is one consumer willing to pay $\$1$ million and 400,000 consumers willing to pay $3. Assume MC=AC=0 and that each consumer will buy either zero or one unit of the good. Third-Degree Price Discrimination Prices: $\$1$ in A, $\$3$ in B Uniform Price: $\$1$ million Price discrimination increases producer and consumer surplus. Conditions I can think of when price discrimination might be good for everyone: otherwise the monopolist drops a market or if the total revenue curve is multi-peaked (as in this example -- note multi-peaked just means it's ambiguous, this example just happened to show higher surplus for everyone). 

I've been reading about the surreal numbers out of curiosity. Though I don't totally understand them, I wonder why I don't see them used more often. Surreal numbers extend the real line to also include infinitesimal and infinite numbers (transfinite ordinals like $\omega$ which is identified with the cardinal number $\aleph_0$, itself the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$). Often, there are interesting preferences which can't be represented by a real-valued utility function. The obvious example is for lexicographic preferences. But why not have $u:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow S^*$, like $u(a,b)=a+\frac{b}{\omega}$? Lexicographic probability spaces are another place where these numbers could have application. If we want to differentiate between two probability zero events, let one have probability $\frac{1}{\omega}$ and the other $\frac{2}{\omega}$. One might ask, sure you can use them, but what's the point? What do we gain? Fair question. I just kind of think the use would make things cleaner--making lexicographic prob spaces less of a tortured construction perhaps.
