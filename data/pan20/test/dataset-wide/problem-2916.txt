Take for instance you are able to go back in time and have one of the worst leaders in history killed him/ her before they came into power, thus eliminating the atrocities they committed. Or see atrocities being committed, kill them to stop them. The fact that you did this evil thing (killing) becomes a good thing. On the other hand can something be so overwhelmingly good/ perfect, but implemented or enacted in such a way that it is evil? At day's end are these labels of good and evil just manifestations of our own viewpoint? How do we know the difference? 

In fiction (and in real life at times) people embrace the inner monsters (sometimes literal, sometimes figurative) to gain the power they need to defeat their foes, get to the next level, or grit through something they'd rather not do. If this is something that seems to work, why are we specifically warned against it? In any war, in any problematic situation where horrible things are happening, it can be impossible (or virtually so) not to use the selfsame tactics of those that oppose you. The saying goes "ALL'S fair in love and war" and even if you'll pay for doing it in the long run by being seen as a monster, by doing these horrible things (or at times even MORE horrible than those that oppose you), you'll have the satisfaction that you won, even though at day's end it was a morally a pyrrhic victory. But if you accomplish what you set out to do, sometimes it's worth it. But such things can't help but drag you through the soil of morality, dirtying you in the process. 

In this day and age with modern medicine, the line between life and death are blurred, as the brain dead may act as if it's alive, and the alive, due to being comatose may be reposed as if dead. What does physicalism say about this blurred line of life and death? 

I do not find the idea of moral realism convincing. My understanding is that it suggests ethical principles are objective features of the world, which we may discover over time as if we were to approach a single, fixed goal. For those inclined towards Platonic idealism the fact that many cultures in the world history have "discovered" versions of the Golden Rule ("One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself") may point to an objective feature whose existence is being revealed. Perhaps Kant's categorical imperative (as mentioned in a previous answer) can also be counted here. This is the (relatively) most convincing argument in favor of moral realism that I am aware of. For my own inclination, what is more important is that moral realism is not the opposite of Nihilism, but that those two sit at opposite ends of a broader spectrum. I am interested in "pragmatic" arguments for ethical principles that occupy the middle ground: "good strategies to maximize happiness" (as mentioned by the OP) and the basis for cohesion in societies, which is key to survival. I often find myself exploring the part of the spectrum where it approaches Nihilism. Perhaps one could argue that ethical principles from Buddhism fit here. If I were to explore the part of the spectrum where it approaches moral realism, I would look e.g. towards Confucianism for (perhaps) convincing arguments that fit there. I am referring to Asian philosophies, because for them the distinction between philosophy (within the scope of this question) and religion ("for comfort", and therefore out of the scope of this question) is less clear than for Western ideas. 

If a member of a (say, Christian) church does not believe in God (e.g. thinks god is a man-made concept) and the surrounding metaphysics but believes that the church as an institution serves a beneficial role overall (e.g. its social role) how could one call that? Is there a special term for this stance? I thought it could be (say, Christian) Humanism, but this is apparently not the right fit. 

In the code of Hammurabi, one of the first laws put forth was "an eye for an eye." We've come a long way since those times both as a society, and in terms of making laws - as well as the ability to provide justice, yet, the idea(s) of equal punishment for a crime still is seen as a valid point. Why? 

Logically, if the only proof of existence we have is what we can see, hear, smell, touch, taste, and feel the movement of, why do many philosophies deal with issues outside the physical? Due to these scientific limitations of not being able to prove anything nonphysical (not limited to entities/ concepts surrounding spirituality and religion[s]) exists in any concrete way that affects our daily lives in ways that WE OURSELVES don't choose it to, why doesn't philosophy eliminate these concepts? 

Oftentimes when doing research and I need a specific term, I use a dictionary definition to "set the groundwork" for the entire paper. Google "what is a person" (with or without quotation marks) comes up with some results. Filter for your use. 

Throughout life there are many choices: do we eat something fast, or do we cook our own food? Do we skimp (or totally skip) healthcare/ dental coverage, or get regular checkups? Do we hookup with people, or do we have something steady with one person (or a few regulars)? Do we take the job that's physically demanding but pays well or the less demanding job with less pay? Do we cut corners to get a job done or do we work hard and ethically, even if it costs us more in the end? Each one of these choices is a trade-off. You might get fast food, but it's not healthy. We might save money on our health initially, but then come up with a disease that is severe but manageable, or something incurable (such as certain STDs) and so on. Even if it works for the majority, is it still right due to the consequences that need to be paid later on? Also, does the fact that we know that these habits are unhealthy play a factor in determining right and wrong? If so, what part? 

You say if yes, then the argument is circular, because we've assumed what we wanted to prove. Just to clarify, Anselm is trying to prove that God exists, not that existence is a greater quality, just making sure we're on the same page. It does not follow directly that because existence is a greater property that the greatest being must exist. In fact, (though I am no expert) I think the key here is something which was pointed out by Kant and echoed by many others, not to exhaust their entire point, but just to borrow, that existence is a unique property (or not a property at all if they have their way). In my opinion, apart from being contradictory, if a property at all, existence is the one thing we cannot give to the definition of a being (or anything else for that matter). I can define a purple, skinny jaberwocky with 5 toes and an affinity for blue cheese, but I cannot define him to exist in reality. It seems Anselm shared my sentiments as this is not what he has done. He set out to prove it, by saying that if the being does not exist, then an existent version can be imagined, and the imagined version would be greater, creating a contradiction, and if the proposition that God does not exist leads to a contradiction, it must be false and God exists. 

Yes, I think you've basically got it right. Honestly the best way to look at it is in the form of a reductio ad absurdum. Take the negative "God does not exist" and prove a contradiction from it, then the negative must be false and God must exist. So he starts with the proposition that God does not exist, then goes on to show that he can imagine a greater being, one that does exist, and that's a contradiction because the original God that didn't exist was supposed to be the greatest. 

Ludwig von Mises' description of economic behavior in Human Action also comes to mind: if memory serves he did not use a single formula (and very few symbols such as X) in a long book whose subject area (i.e. economics) would seem to offer many opportunities for symbolic notations. I am also curious whether he was influenced by a (philosophical) school in making this choice. 

What evidence, if any, is there that early Western thinkers were indeed influenced by Hindu thought? Are there any examples among ancient Greek philosophers, say? 

This conveys to me that Wittgenstein judged the subjects of philosophy (including knowledge of self) ultimately more important than the subjects of science (the mechanics of matter, etc.). Remember that his initial training was as an mechanics engineer, so to the degree engineering is close to science the statement perhaps is a reflection on his own turn in life, viewed from a subjective (and just perhaps a bit bitter) angle. 

Derek Parfit (of Reasons and Persons fame) lists the definition of the self that is implicit in your scenario as only one of many alternative views that are held also by experts in the field: 

With that, there is little chance that there is a definite answer to your question because it is tied to religious questions that are famously disputed since time immemorial. 

Can someone expert with Confucius' Analects please put the quote in context and explain what "upgrading" means in this context? 

I am fond of this quote by Confucius, except that I cannot quite understand the term "upgrading" in the last sentence: 

If you allow that e.g. "Come!" has the same connotation as "You must come!" (and allow linguistic jargon as well), you could call it a directive or deontic modality: 

Apart from "slavery in a mental form" the description (and for what I remember, also the back cover) of Kevin Bales' book Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy argues that "more than twenty-seven million people are still trapped in [slavery]" (mostly) of the conventional kind. 

Is there a thing in my mind? Is that how it's phrased? I understand there is the definition of apple as a concept...is this what is in my mind? The definition doesn't include red though...Honestly I would have said that if there is a thing and I'm thinking about it, there are two different entities, there is the real thing that exists and there is the concept of it in my mind, but this doesn't seem to be correct. Can anyone please tell me what actually is in my mind? Is it called a concept? Thanking you in advance. 

I'm no expert but I think the way in which Kant's comments apply to Anselm's argument are to undermine the idea that the concept of something and the corresponding being are different. He says that nothing is added to the concept to get the real thing. Something like 'there is no more in a hundred conceptual dollars than there is in a hundred real dollars', for if there were, then the concept would not accurately represent the real thing....I personally see a problem with this, as I think concepts are worlds apart from real objects. 

If I am thinking of an apple, and I think of it as red, is that a different kind of red to the property of red a real object has? I would think that the property of red a real apple has is a real red, but the property of red a conceptual apple has is not real, its just imagination red. What kind of philosophy is this? Does anyone know where I can find information about it, in a book? Or website? Thanking you very much in advance. 

This argument is quite a complex one, I'm not sure whereabouts you found a summary of it, but I think the best way to look at it is as a reductio ad absurdum. A reductio starts off with an assumption, and then goes on to prove a contradiction that follows from that assumption. Since a contradiction has been shown, the opposite of the assumption must be true. In this case, the assumption is that God does not exist, and the contradiction is that I can imagine a greater God, one that does exist. The conclusion is therefore stated as the opposite of the assumption, that God does exist. I found your question very helfpful, it is a seeming paradox that I could define something to exist and yet observe that it does not. However I honestly believe that, though it may not have been what Kant was getting at when he said "being is obviously not a real predicate", existence is a special kind of property, one that we cannot define something to have. Though I am starting to have doubts about what I just said, I know that God exists, and if he ceased to exist, then he would cease to be himself. This is the definition of an essential property....versus an accidental property, which, if a thing ceased to have, then it would not be itself anymore. So basically what I'm saying is that, things that do exist, DO have existence as part of their definition, and so it IS possible to define something to exist (as long as it actually does) and God does exist, I assure you. Existence is part of his definition.
