In general, a pound of fat is ~3500 Calories. If you do not change what you are eating, and you are burning 1,000 Calories a day through exercise, you can lose a pound every 3-4 days. However, to keep it off, you will have to either adjust what you are eating or keep doing the grueling workout from now till eternity. 

Having done squats now for a while, there are a few things that can throw off your balance in no order of precedence: 

Low-weight, high rep work helps get blood flowing through the affected area which speeds recovery. While pull ups are great at working the lats, they will likely be too heavy to get the work you want done. Potential lat exercises can be: 

StrongLifts recommends a very certain way of warming up, and Starting Strength is not too different either. I'm going to present the commonalities: 

After you've done the meat of your exercise, it's a good idea to bring your heart rate back to normal and your muscles back to a resting state gradually. Many exercises are anaerobic (sprinting, weight lifting, most sports), and as a result you may have built up some lactic acid in your muscles. That's part of how muscles get energy during anaerobic activity. The cool down process helps the blood keep flowing to flush the excess lactic acid without adding more. Runners will cool down by decreasing their pace gradually, at least until their heart rate is well in the aerobic zone (you'll be able to talk in sentences). Many athletes will use a more full stretching routine to increase their range of motion and help them perform their technique better by the next workout. The answer I gave is the basic structure of how I exercise. First, I warm up doing some lighter load lifting (since I lift weights) until I get to my work weight. Next, I do the exercises I set out to do. Finally, I cool down by stretching to improve my range of motion. This basic structure works for me, and it will work for anyone regardless of the type of exercise they do. The type of work that you use to warm up or cool down really depends on the main exercise you want to do. 

That's within the normal variance. Several things can contribute to the higher number on the scale including, but not limited to: 

For example, bench press at 117 is really too small to need a whole 5 sets of warmup. In this case the warmup would look like this: 

As the person performing the work, there are some considerations that you have to ensure are correct to meet your goals: 

The difference is in the set up. The full squat is part of the clean deadlift, although the person takes the slack out of their body before the pull so the distinction of a clean deadlift from a conventional deadlift is more of splitting hairs than anything. Your sticking point (or weak point) in the lift is usually dictated by the bar position relative to your feet when you start: 

If you can get someone to lift with you, or just give you a hand off, that can make things a lot better. If you grab a random guy in the gym, make sure they understand you only want them to hand you the bar and you don't want them to interfere with the bench in any way. 

Based on a few articles about elliptical trainers the magnetic resistance is the highest quality for a couple reasons: 

From everything I've seen this is true. Now, what happens when you have a higher lean mass is that your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) go up. That means you are burning more calories at rest. For the sake of argument, let's say you've added a lot of muscle and raised your BMR. The change might not be as much as you think. When I got done losing a lot of weight, I had a BMR of about 2000 calories. I've since put on a lot of muscle. My new calculated BMR is roughly 2200 calories. While that's 200 more calories that I burn just breathing it's only a little bit more. Cardio on the other hand can burn over 1000 calories an hour depending on how hard your heart is working, the type of exercise, etc. If you did an hour of cardio every other day, or even three times a week, you can burn more calories than you would after three months of lifting weights. Of course, there's nothing to say that you can't do both either. Get both benefits... 

Jim Wendler's Twist Wendler was once a power lifter, and has devised a program (5/3/1) that can really be tailored to your end goals. His program is designed for advanced lifters, meaning someone who can only make strength increases once a month. However, there are some underlying philosophies that can be very useful depending on your current set of goals: 

Even just doing GPP work at a sufficient intensity and volume can greatly reduce the DOMS you would receive from sporadic activities. SSP work will help your technique and ability to perform your sport of choice. The key here is to perform regular exercise. You may still get DOMS from the special activity, but it will not be as intense as you have taught your body how to recover more effectively. 

I only have the Calorie count for your breakfast (70 Cal). There's no mention of the type of salad dressing or amount, there's not much mention of good protein sources which are necessary for proper metabolic function. NOTE: I would suggest kelp or iodized salt to support your thyroid. Salads can be deceptively high in calories, particularly if you purchased it from a restaurant. Another very real possibility is that the total amount of Calories you have are way below what you need. I recommend you start with a reasonably good estimate for how much you need to maintain your current weight: 

Keep in mind that BMI is really only useful as a statistical measurement. It has no concept of body fat percentage, and is merely a ratio of height and weight. As a statistical measurement the outlyers (those with above average lean mass and those with below average lean mass) cancel each other out. BMI is just a rough way to determine who may be at risk--typically because of too much body fat which is hard to measure accurately. If you have average lean mass as defined by the charts used to interpret BMI, than it is an easy indicator of your weight loss progress. There are two cases where BMI simply is not useful: 

Perhaps it would help to describe what your current diet is like on average. Fruits and veggies have certain benefits that you need to make sure you are continuing to get, although they also have some disadvantages. Let's start at the beginning with nutrition. You need something representative of each macronutrient: 

The best answer for you really depends on what your overall goals are, whether you are attempting to be in shape for any type of sport, etc. As a result, the advice in this answer is more generic. The basic approach for "doing it right" is: 

Each of these get your heart rate up, and the goal is to maintain an elevated heart rate for 30 minutes to an hour. The time for rest between circuits can be from when you are breathing really heavy to when you can speak in sentences again. If you have a heart rate monitor you can keep your heart rate up between 120-150 BPM for most of the workout. The good news is that by being creative you can balance conditioning work and strength work well. You can do your main work normally in the beginning of a training session, then superset all the assistance work. You can also choose to take the stairs instead of elevators or escalators when you can. All these options pack a lot of work in a little time. 

Step 2: Prep Work This is where you give them some basic homework to build strength while you work on technique and mobility for the main program. This might not be a necessary step depending on their level of fitness, but I'm including it just in case they might need it. At this stage you are giving them work just about everyone should be able to accomplish:
