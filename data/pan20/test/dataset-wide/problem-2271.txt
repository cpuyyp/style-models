I watch raptor nests which requires me to venture into the woods during the spring and summer. I have found that the best defense against mosquitoes is long sleeves and long pants. I wear a cycling jersey. It is comfortable in the hottest weather because it wicks away moisture. I have lightweight, zip-off legged pants. So, I can zip off the legs when I am done with my hike for the rest of the day. For my exposed areas (neck, face and hands) I use a Deet product. I spray the backs of my hands and rub my neck and cheeks. I have thought about getting a bug net for my head. I have also thought about using a bandana around my neck with a heavy application of the bug repellent instead of putting it on my skin. Maybe that might work for you. 

If the tent fly can be pitched without the inner then your winter tent becomes a summer tent by leaving the inner at home. 

I carry a Victorinox knife. On my last few trips I've used the various tools on it to pry shellfish off rocks, slice cheese and salami, prepare vegetables, cut sticking plaster, cut duct tape for gear repair, cut cloth to make a dressing, open packets of dehydrated food neatly. I have, in the past, used the wood saw on it to clear windfall. It did the job but a folding saw would have been much better. Of all the non-knife tools, the scissors get the most use. As far as other gear, I also carry a KFS set (a knife because the pocket knife is useless at spreading marmite and jam). I go out with people who carry no knives at all. I wonder what they would do if they had to cut clothes to make bandages or slings? To make an emergency shelter? 

Being in the military, I particularly like the idea of Challenge Coins (if you have the funding to put into it) as a geocaching reward. Places like this ($URL$ let you make your own, or you could consider buying a pre-made coin. They're small and pretty fun to have. I would definitely save them for a tougher find though, as they can cost 2-3 USD a piece. 

The main reason it's buried is to keep it from washing into water supplies. The ground provides natural filtration, where surface waste is fully exposed to the elements and can flow along the surface until it reaches a stream or pond. Yes, digging holes might be bad for one plant, but it's a whole lot better than polluting a water supply that animals (or even humans) might consume or people might swim in. You could bag it and take it out with you if you really want to, but you aren't doing much harm if you dig appropriately sized holes. Besides, plastic bags are worse for the environment than holes in the long run. 

Given that it is above the mesh pocket at the side, my guess is that it is for walking/ski poles. If you need to put the poles away for a short time (for example, a traverse using your ice axe, a river crossing), you don't need to go to the trouble of loosening the compression straps (the ones holding the tent poles in the photos above). 

Let me turn the question around: Is it ethical to use a portable stove to burn irreplaceable fossil fuels? Is it ethical to carry that fossil fuel in a pressurised can (for gas fuel stoves) or metal bottle (for liquid fuel stoves) that can't be easily recycled and so ends up in landfill? However, note Shem's comment below - Aluminium bottles are almost infinitely recyclable. I think the answer lies in the scale. Using a few twigs in a twig burner is fine. Using all the dead trees in a half-kilometer radius to build a bonfire the size of your tent is not. Most of the outdoor places where I go in New Zealand are under fire bans and most of the huts have had their open fires replaced with potbelly stoves which aren't that good for cooking, so I have no choice but to carry a portable cooker. 

Since you are in the Midwest: If you are looking for something a bit different: The Cuyahoga Valley National Park has a train (Scenic Railroad) that runs through the park. You can take your bike on the train (at a very cheap price). So, you can park on the very northern part of the park, take the train south and bike back on the bike trail that is the old tow path for the Canal. It is a beautiful place to ride a bike. Lot of information on the National Park's website with a link to the railroad. The bike trail is eventually going to go from Lake Erie in Cleveland down to New Philadelphia. Maybe even farther south. 

It is not. The lowest-impact solution is to use a poo-pot. These are compulsory in alpine areas here in New Zealand. Pack it out - Poo pots 

I clean my drinking system with lots of hot water then sterilise it using baby bottle sterilising tablets. Once it is clean, I don't dry it - I store it in the freezer. :-) Additionally, I don't use anything but water. People I know who use powdered drinks or sugar solution tell me the black mold grows really quickly inside the drinking tube and valve. 

Scheduled Transport If you are catching scheduled transport (e.g. bus or ferry) then you need a watch. There might only be one trip a day. If you miss it, you are stuck for an extra night. You might be ticketed on one particular time, so if you are late, the next bus or plane won't pick you up. For example, the Milford Track Great Walk in New Zealand. There are only two boat trips a day in summer, and you are ticketed for one specific time. If you miss that, the other ferry that day will only take you if there is space available. Tides If your transport is a boat that can only get in at high tide, then you need a watch. If you are making a crossing that can only be done at low tide, then you need a watch. 

The best thing to do is to try on the glasses in a store. Take your time and look around with your eyes to see how much is covered. You can also determine if the nose bridge or other part of the frame is in the way of your line of sight. I never buy glasses online unless I am buying a model I have owned before. Cycling eyewear is a very good option because most brands are well-made and impact resistant. Another option is to use the glasses in the photo and to wear a baseball cap. But, you still won't be covered on the sides. 

From that linked site, "Hunting" just seems to be a marketing term, since most of the boots appear in multiple categories. Here in New Zealand, professional hunters usually wear rubber lace-ups. When you spend weeks in the bush at a time, a leather boot will rot and fall apart. People who hunt for a day or a weekend wear the same boots as pretty much everyone else in the bush. About the only distinction a New Zealand store would make in marketing boots is "Non-Alpine" and "Alpine" - the difference being that alpine boots have full-length shanks and mounting points for crampons. For example, Torpedo7 has "Hiking Boots" and "Snow Boots". 

If you're lost in the wilderness (and you've foolishly left behind your handy dandy water purification tablets and water filter), what are some of the best and safest ways to purify water? What do you do if you don't have a metal pot to boil water in? 

The main reason people usually share best practices orally and in person is because the experienced climber can correct the mistakes the student will make. No matter how good you are at reading, translating potentially life or death skills from a page to the rock wall is no sure thing. Some things can be learned by reading, but it will only take the smallest mistake to kill you or someone you're climbing with. Use resources like the above with a big grain of salt. 

Don't freeze the bottle - fill it with ice cubes. Better still, don't use ice cubes, use ice sticks that fit in the neck of bottles. 

Ray Mears has produced videos on sharpening knives. In particular, sharpening them in camp and in the field. The teqhnique is pretty much as @WedaPashi explains it, but it's good to see a video of the correct approach. 

I asked my fitness instructor this question a few years ago. She had several things to say. Electrolyte replacement is for when you have been in a high cardio, sweating mode continually for an hour or more. Endurance runners and cyclists, yes. Gym bunnies, trampers, walkers, no. Very few things on the market are actually true electrolyte replacement. Almost all the things in the fridge at your local store with things like "vitamin water" on the label are just soft drinks, full of sugar and caffeine. She said that in New Zealand there were only two proper electrolyte replacement products you could buy without going to a specialty sports shop. As an aside, you can usually tell a decent one by the fact they taste metallic and "slimy". :-) For long distance hiking (6 hours or more) she suggested that if I suffered from headaches on the drive home then perhaps I could put a bottle of electrolyte replacement in the car and drink it at the end of the trip. Otherwise, I should stick to water and the usual hiking snacks of peanuts, crackers, dried fruit and so on. In the gym, she said there should be nothing but water in my bottle and I should replace water lost exactly. I should stand on the scales with my full water bottle at the beginning of the workout and stand on the scales with my empty water bottle at the end of the workout and the two weights should be the same.
