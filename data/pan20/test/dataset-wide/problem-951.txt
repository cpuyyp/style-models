NOAA revised the data. The map below is for the same date and time as the first map in the question, but with the anomaly gone. So I'll have to assume the event wasn't real. 

The amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased about 30% since pre-industrial times, and the amount in biomass, not including soil, has decreased about 10%. Amount in the oceans has not changed significantly. 

The answer depends a lot on what you mean by "excluding shale oil". Tight oil production, commonly referred to as "shale oil" is about 4 million barrels per day currently (2014), compare to almost none in 2005. Canadian oil sands production is at 2 millon barrels per day, compare to about 700,000 per day in 2005. So compare to 2005, tight oil (shale oil) and oil sands production is up about 5 million barrels per day. Now look at total world oil production: 

There is no way to estimate rain fall from the description, because Genesis makes clear water came from "the deep" as well as from above. For example the passage qouted in the OP says "springs of the great deep burst forth" and Genesis 8:2 says "the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. " 

According to Towards closing the window on strongly interacting dark matter: Far-reaching constraints from Earth’s heat flow PHYSICAL REVIEW D 76, 043523 (2007) and references cited therein, the heat flux from Earth's interior to the surface is $44.2 \pm 1$ terawatts, or $0.087 \pm 0.002 W/m^2$. Of the 44.2 TW, 40% is attributable to radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. The remainder is usually attributed an unknown amount from potassium decay and cooling from an initial high temperature; however, it cannot be ruled out that a significant fraction is from interaction of dark matter with Earth. 

According "The youngest natural oil on earth" Doklady Chemistry vol. 438, pages 144-147: Prior to this paper, it was known that oil of the Guaymas basin is from young sediments and is 5000 years old. However, their work shows that oil in the Kamchatka volcanic area is "less than 50 years old". Oil is shown through carbon dating to have formed between 1962 and 1973. At the opposite extreme, this 1986 New York times article reports: 

So 12,000 sq. mi. or 31,000 sq. km. is the largest known iceberg. Both of the two previous references also mention a 1927 Antarctic iceberg that was 170 km long, but area is not given. American Practical Navigator, says the 1927 iceberg was 100 mile long and 100 miles wide, so 25,000 sq. km. In summary, an iceberg the size of that contemplated in the OP can be expected on the once every 5-20 years time scale. update 7/12/2017: according to the MIDAS project: 

For detailed information, see Isotopes of the Earth's Hydrosphere, especially chapter 3 which is "Isotopic Composition of Ocean Water". At the surface, deuterium fraction is maximized in regions of high evaporation, and minimized in areas with ice. In the deep ocean, there is about 2% above average deuterium in arctic, and 2% below average near Antarctica. There is a general increasing trend from south to north. 

From the graph it can been seen that subtracting out the 5 million barrels/day of unconventional production, world production is somewhat below the 2005 level. (Quantitative values were 73.9 M bbl/day in 2005; 76.9 M bbl/day in first 8 months of 2014) With the expectation that tight oil and oil sands production will increase in share of the production, it is entirely possible that the peak in conventional production has already occurred. 

Planetary Sciences, table 1.2, says the distance between CF and CM is 0.80 km, citing to Yoder 1995. See also Evidence for convection in planetary interiors from first-order topography The Moon March 1973, Volume 7, pages 172-180 

Personally, I wouldn't call these glaciers. It is more that water is being dammed so it freezes rather than runs off, and stays frozen into the spring then eventually melts before the end of the season. 

According to the US Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center : Though in their data table they use the term "ppmv", they explain: 

According to Record of Cycling Operation of the Natural Nuclear Reactor in the Oklo/Okelobondo Area in Gabon, the Xe is trapped in crystalline cage-like structures formed of the aluminum phosphate that are similar to zeolites. The reference also explains that the aluminum phosphate structures grow quickly under hydrothermal conditions of 270-300 degrees C. 

The lifetime of a fluorescence excited state is on the nanosecond to microsecond time scale. So once the excitation source light is removed, the emission of light will stop within microseconds. Note that fluorescence is distinct from phosphoresence, and phosphorescence can involve longer lifetime excited states. Spectroscopic Characterization of the Uranium Carbonate Andersonite provides quantitative information on fluorescence lifetimes for Andersonite, and lifetimes are in the microsecond range. Regarding phosphorescence, see Phosphorescence; or, The emission of light by minerals, plants, and animals (1862): 

One standard that has be used by the USA is to measure the distant between points on the coast at intervals of 30 latitude minutes, as measured on a 1:1,200,000 scale map. See chapter 5 of Measurements from Maps: Principles and Methods of Cartometry by D. H. Maling for further information and other standards that have been used. 

In March 2000 iceberg B-15 formed which was 11,000 sq. km. and 295 km long. In October 1998 iceberg A-38 formed which was 6,900 sq. km. A Delaware size iceberg would be the 3rd largest in the past 20 years. The 1990 article The calving and drift of iceberg B-9 in the Ross Sea, Antarctica Antarctic Science Vol. 2 , pages 243-257 says: 

First, don't take that graph too literally, it is just a cartoon version and isn't quantitatively correct. The USSR heavily subsidized fertilizer until 1988. When they ended the subsidy, fertilizer prices increased to market prices and use of fertilizer decreased. Fertilizer use decreased further after the USSR fell a couple years later. Fertilizer use in France, Germany, UK and Japan peaked in the 1980s and contributed to the decline. 

As one half of the naturally occurring Carbonate–silicate cycle, carbon dioxide is naturally removed from the atmosphere by the chemical reaction: CaSiO$_3$ + 2CO$_2$ + H$_2$O → Ca2+(aq) + 2HCO$_3$-(aq) + SiO$_2$ What would be the side effects of artificially enhancing this process by mining large amounts (on the order of 10 times world coal production) of silicate bearing rocks to reverse man-made climate change?
