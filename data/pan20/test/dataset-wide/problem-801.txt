A basic approach would be to estimate the air-pressure at the top of the mantle. Uranus' surface gravity is a bit less than Earths, but, somewhat counter-intuitively, it's atmosphere is light enough that it's gravity increases as you move inside the planet towards the top of the mantle. (the same is true for Earth). For ballpark estimate, lets say the gravity works out to be about the same as Earths, because I don't want to calculate, but it might be a bit more than that. The Mass of Uranus' atmosphere, by Wikipedia is about 0.5 times the mass of Earth. It's surface area is about 16 times Earth (4 times the Radius), but the surface area of the Mantle would be less, about 80% of the radius which works out about 10.2 times the surface area. If you spread 0.5 Earth masses over 10.2 times Earth's surface area, you get a pressure between 50,000 and 60,000 atm. Some 50 times the upper limit you provided in your question. That's probably a limiting factor for most "ice giants". There's simply too much hydrogen and helium atmosphere to allow liquid water at 1,100 ATM. Ice giants might create their own hydrogen by heat and pressure on Methane, creating diamond like structures and free hydrogen. The heat below all that atmosphere (about 20% of Uranus' radius) would be outside your criteria too. I couldn't find any good estimates for Uranus' mantle's temperature. There's too many unknowns about why Uranus is as cold as it is on it's surface, so estimates on it's mantle temperature seem pretty tentative and unavailable, but what little I know about how temperature rises inside a planet, I don't see any way the top of Uranus' mantle would come close to the temperature criteria you gave. Not at a depth of 20% of Uranus' radius. Consider this chart from Uranus' wikipedia at 200,000 mbar Uranus temperature is approaching 340 K. 200,000 mbar is about 200 atm. The mantle begins, by my ballpark estimate at about 50,000 atm. The temperature wouldn't be close unless the planet had a very long time to cool down, perhaps tens of billions of years. I could run ballpark estimates on Neptune too, but I suspect the results would be similar. For an ice giant to meet your criteria, it would need to have comparatively very little hydrogen and helium compared to Uranus. Perhaps if an ice giant was close enough to it's star that it had a hot enough surface temperature to lose much of it's hydrogen and helium through Jeans escape, and then, it had a long time to cool down, it might get the right criteria of liquid water at the proper range of temperature and pressure. I don't see any other scenario where it would work. 

It's habitability is uncertain. Red Dwarf stars that small could be unkind to their planets and strip them of most of their atmospheres. We'll get a better look at the exoplanets around Proxima Centauri when the James Webb Space Telescope is up and running. It's scheduled to launch in 2019 and it should be able to tell us something about exoplanet's atmospheres, which would go a long way towards estimating any habitability. Actually getting there, even with a small unmanned craft is a long ways away. There's still significant technological difficulties with Breakthrough Starshot. The lasers aren't set up yet for one. For two, the aim has to be just about perfect, and three, we currently have no means of receiving a signal from a craft that far away. We have to improve our communications tech. Now, in theory, we know how to do it. We could build giant satellite dishes on the Moon, for example, or orbiting in space, but that's very expensive. Another issue with starshot is that they have no means of slowing down, so they'd pass through the solar-systems they were sent to examine in a rapid fly-by, perhaps 10% of the speed of light, with only a few hours within the solar-system. Fly-by missions are still useful, and given the difficulty of transmitting data an orbiting mission in another solar-system might not make practical sense, because such a mission could easily gather more information than it could send back. The recent New Horizons / Pluto mission was a fly-by and it gathered a lot of information, that took over a year to send back to Earth. Rapid fly-bys shouldn't be dismissed though. They can gather a lot of information that we have trouble seeing from Earth, even with newer and bigger telescopes. More ambitious missions, and ships with their own fuel so they can break and remain in a distant solar-system are harder. That requires much more equipment, much more mass and as a result, would accelerate more slowly. Manned missions 4.2 light years away are so far out of reach that it makes little sense to talk about them outside of science fiction. A manned mission to Mars is hard enough and that's over 100,000 times closer. Starshot is many years away. We might see Starshot launch in a decade or two - if it moves quickly. Then it'll be another 2 decades or so for the ship to reach the Proxima system and another 4 years and change for any information to be returned. 35-45 years is probably on the ambitious estimate before we receive the first starshot data. Most of the new information about exoplanets that we're going to get over the next few years will come from telescopes like James Webb and others that follow. 

I don't like the spiral. It's pretty but I don't like it. (I'll get to that shortly). On the suddenness of the visual at the London sunrise, consider what we see. Two cops are chasing their suspect. Other cops are in the garage with their boss who was shot a bit before. Some paramedics are there, taking care of the shot person. The cops chasing grace aren't going to stop and check their phones, so it's entirely possible that images began flooding the internets minutes before and the people in the show weren't aware. 

OK, I did a bit of research on this. The LA Times article you quoted says something a little bit useful. 

Gravity does change a bit at different points in an orbit for the reasons you say, planets aren't uniform. The Moon is especially unbalanced for example so this is more apparent with orbits around the moon, but all planets have some degree of non uniform mass and that has some tiny effects but that's not the cause for ellipses though, in fact, non-uniform mass will slightly warp an elliptical orbit. 

Just for clarification, it sounds like you're asking, in addition to asteroid tracking, about a possible astronomical explanation to Crucifixion Darkness. That would require a collision in transit between the Earth and the Sun that would make a debris cloud large enough for 3 hours of shade. Such an astronomical event would be very rare because asteroid on asteroid collisions are rare and this one would need to be precisely timed and placed. Ideally you'd want the debris field to be moving in roughly the same direction as the earth relative to the sun, to maximize the shading period of time. Such an event is extremely extremely unlikely but not impossible. 

For any local map of galaxies, the relative velocity is slow enough as to be irrelevant. Andromeda and the Milky way are roughly 2.5 million light years apart and they are moving towards each other currently at about 1 light year every 2,270 years (based on 402,000 km/h). In the 2.5 million years that it takes for Andromeda's light to reach us, it's moved less than 0.05% closer to us, so any adjustment on the maps to account for Andromeda's distance relative to our galaxy would be very small and not worth adjusting unless you're actually plotting it's movement in great detail. For most maps, what we see, even 2.5 million years old, is close enough and that's true for all local galaxies. That said, your intuition is correct, the light we see and the pictures made of Andromeda are where it was 2.5 million years ago. The more interesting movement is that it's rotated a handful of degrees in that time. For maps over a billion light years across or of the known universe, then it's a little different because the relative movement is sufficient to measurably have changed the map in the time it took the light to reach us. That said, calculating where galaxies would be now vs where they were when the light left them is rather a lot of work. What's commonly done, rather than show distance for maps of that size is that they're usually coded with a redshift percentage instead of the more familiar distance ratio key. 

As I understand it, volcanic eruptions are unlikely to send anything into space unless it's a smaller sized moon. The escape velocity (young earth, maybe 10 km/s, young mars, maybe 3-4), volcanic eruptions, as far as I know, don't shoot things out at 10,000 - 20,000 MPH. But meteor impacts of sufficient size can do that. Mars is a better meteor debris making target than the Earth cause it's smaller, so the gravity is lower and presumably it's mostly had a thinner atmosphere too. We've found martial meteors on Earth. We might not find any Earth meteors on mars cause it takes a much bigger impact to knock bits of rock off Earth and because the Atmosphere slows objects down, both coming in and going out. 

Tar is a pretty nonspecific term, tar-like even more so, but tar is made by cooking coal or wood without oxygen, so I would assume this implies it's not Oxygen rich. More "simple" complex hydrocarbon chains (and because "simple" complex is somewhat confusing, another way to say that it's probably mostly Cs and Hs in a fairly big molecule, probably 5, maybe 6 carbons minimum I would think, otherwise it would be too quickly sublimated into gas. Tar like aliphatic compounds would still be vulnerable to photo-disintegration by UV light from the sun, which is common enough on Ceres Surface, but would be high enough melting points to not evaporate somewhat rapidly like shorter chains would. That these compounds were found locally probably implies somewhat recent, localized hydro-thermal activity. The Aromatic C-H bond and the Aliphatic C-H bond have different spectroscopy. Source. 

I'm not sure exactly what your question is, but Tidal locking is fairly common for moons. If the Gas giant was in the habitable zone of the red dwarf star, then it would need to be fairly close and as a result the Moon would need to be fairly close to the Gas giant - it should be tidally locked to the gas giant, not the star. (A moon being tidally locked to a star is probably impossible because the planet will always have the greater tidal effect on the moon). So your scenario, you have a moon, tidally locked to a gas giant planet, which orbits a star. Tides don't exist in a perfectly circular tidal lock because the pressure is constant, but there's no such thing as a perfectly circular orbit, so there will always be some tidal squeezing as the moon moves around the planet. The real question is how eccentric the Moon's orbit is around the gas giant planet, because it's eccentricity will determine it's tidal squeezing and any libration. As far as periodic habitable zones, that would depend on how eccentric the orbit of the gas giant was around the star. You could have it moving in and out of the habitable zone, but it would presumably be a short-period orbit, so it would be a matter of days outside, then days inside, perhaps a week or two outside and a week or two inside, unless you went highly eccentric. All these are general points. There's lots of variables. There's no one answer for where the Moon would receive most of it's heat - you'd need to work out the specifics or orbit, distance and solar temperature and then give the Moon a specific orbit and then you could work out an approximation of where more heat comes from. and this feels like worldbuilding to me. It's too hypothetical for astronomy. 

I can only give an intuitive answer here, but collisions that liquefy a planet are rare and, especially with smaller planets, would be more likely to blow the planet to bits as soon as melt it. Take the giant impact on Mars. Article Here and Here. The 2nd article says that the object that hit Mars was thought to be traveling at about "6 to 10 kilometers per second." and size "roughly 1,600 to 2,700 kilometers across" - so, bigger than Ceres, Smaller than the Moon and this may have melted half of Mars' surface but it didn't melt all of it cause it left a measurably difference in Mars crust one side to the other. If a collision of that enormous size didn't melt Mars all the way around - I'd wager that such melting is pretty rare. 2nd point, as a general principal, the Solar system objects orbit in the same direction and the further out you get from the sun, the slower the orbital speed (though the more likely you get eccentric orbits). The speed of collisions in space are roughly the vector addition of the 2 objects orbital speeds, which are often somewhat in line with each other, plus the escape velocity of the more massive object (or a bit more than that if both objects are massive), so once objects get to be a pretty good size, about the size where they become spheres, collisions that would melt the object grow less and less likely, and if it is large enough to do that, you should also expect a fair bit of debris from impact. My guess, based on just barely enough knowledge to think about this stuff, is that planetoids and large enough to maybe get spherical asteroids are unlikely to form into spheres due to melting from heat from collisions because due to the relatively weak gravity of smaller objects like that (Ceres has an escape velocity of 0.51 km/s, about 1140 MPH), an impact to generate enough heat to melt it would blow half the dwarf planet away, give or take. Now, if you have a very hot planet that's very very close to the sun and at near liquid temperature anyway or if you have a coalescing and a multitude of successive impacts and lots of heat collecting in the object, then, sure. It's certainly possible but my guess is that a planetoid or asteroid forming into a sphere due to melting it's rare. That's a layman's answer. 

Polyphant is correct, it can operate either way. It's hypothesized that Jupiter in 2:1 resonance with Saturn was the cause of the late heavy bombardment. Source The 2 largest objects in the solar system operating in resonance tended to stir everything up. Many small objects including Neptune and Uranus were thrown around, some into the sun, some in towards the inner solar-system where some crashed into other planets and some out of the solar system or into the Kuiper belt, but all that ended 3.8 billion years ago. The dummies answer is that most of the stuff in the solar system that had orbits that were likely to crash into a planet have already done so, and Jupiter sped that process up. The slightly longer answer follows: For the time being, the asteroid belt is mostly stable, as are Jupiter's two Trojan regions, L4 and L5 and Jupiter's hildas are also stable. So that's basically why we're in a low bombardment period now. The inner solar-system objects are mostly in stable orbits where they aren't in position to crash into planets. To collide, orbits need to cross and mostly the inner solar system objects don't cross orbits with planets. See here: 

First, I think Rob Jeffries answer is brilliant. I'll just add a minor points that might be worth mentioning. 

Your thinking is incorrect. High gravity, or, more specifically, strong tidal forces lead to tidal locking not faster spinning. Moons are a good example of this. The Earth's gravity keeps the same side of the Mon facing the Earth at all times. The Moon still rotates but it's rotation is in sync with it's orbit around the Earth, 1:1, so the same size of the Moon (the heavier/denser side) always points towards Earth. Many moons are tidally locked to their planets as a result of the strong tidal force. Pluto and Charon are tidally locked to each other. That said, tidal locking takes a long time. Just passing close to a massive object wouldn't stop a planet from rotating. It takes many orbits to create the tidal locking, usually millions or billions. Because planets tend to be pretty uniform in density, gravity doesn't affect their rotation very much. A highly eccentric orbit, the sun isn't close to the center, either. A low eccentricity orbit, the sun is close to the center.
