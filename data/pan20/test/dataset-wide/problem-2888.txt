In addition to Herman Hofman's recommendation to read Camus, here are a few places providing information about Camus and topics associated with him. Aronson, Ronald, "Albert Camus", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <$URL$ David Simpson's "Albert Camus (1913-1969)" in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The Wikipedia article on Camus may also be helpful. All three of these articles provide bibliographies where more information can be found. These three sources, being encyclopedias, are also good for other topics besides Camus. Having more than one source is good in case one finds one of the sources inaccessible or for some reason confusing. 

Note that the natural numbers contain the positive integers as well as 0. Of the four operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, only two of these operations are closed in the natural numbers, addition and multiplication. That is, given two natural numbers, n and m, we can add them, n + m, and multiply them, n * m, and the results will be natural numbers. This doesn’t always work for subtraction and division as you observed. So, these operations are not closed. That does not mean that there is "no way to divide 1 by any natural numbers other than 1 itself". There are workarounds using multiplication with a remainder. For example, we can say that if n = s * t where n, s and t are natural numbers, then both s and t “divide” n. Also, if n = q * m + r where n, q, m, and r are natural numbers and r > 0 then neither q nor m "divide" n because their product leaves a positive remainder. This gives us a way to work with division even though the division operation is not closed in the natural numbers. Furthermore, we can restrict the remainder to be less than m and greater than or equal to 0 because there is an order on the natural numbers. This simplifies finding natural numbers, q and r, and makes the pair, q and r, unique for any given n and m. Given this notion of division, we can say that a natural number, n, is even if 2 divides that number, that is, the natural number is even if its remainder upon division by 2 is 0. If not then n is odd. In the case of the natural number 1, we see that 1 = 0 * 2 + 1. Since the remainder is 1, the natural number 1 is odd. 

Regarding the afterlife, see Raymond Moody's Life after Life. He introduced the term "near-death experience". A near-death experience is when someone dies and then comes back to life with a story to tell. There are many people with such experiences. A famous one is Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven. There are also reports of "shared-death experiences" where someone dies but people around them experience something similar to a near-death experience. There are also accounts of "after death communications" where those who have died communicate with those still living. See the International Association for Near Death Studies, Inc (IANDS) for more information on what people have reported. 

See Erwin Schrodinger’s “Mind and Matter” for a discussion of “objectivization”. The “Subject of Cognizance” is excluded from the domain of nature during this simplification resulting in the “hypothesis of the real world”. By this account what physics studies is an abstraction. It is convenient to study reality this way but if we forget that this is an abstraction we risk what Whitehead calls the “fallacy of misplaced concreteness”. The concrete fact includes the Subject of Cognizance. Given Schrodinger’s account physics is not able to study non-physical entities or concepts directly because what is non-physical goes through the abstraction of objectivization first. The non-physical is lost in the process. See the physicist Shimon Malin’s “Nature Loves to Hide” for a way for physics, with the help of philosophy, to approach the non-physical indirectly. The indirectness comes from attempting to make sense out of the limitations of objectivization when it is confronted with the collapse of a quantum event. Prior to the observation there are only potentialities. These potentialities could be viewed as “non-physical”. The physical begins with the collapse. One cannot observe these potentialities without collapsing them, but one is aware of the multiple possibilities. The awareness of the possibilities is an indirect look at the non-physical. 

Jonathan Haidt in the first part of The Righteous Mind describes the dominant idea of moral psychology in the late twentieth century as a belief in rationalism with moral themes restricted to issues of harm. Moral development in a child was not viewed as social construction (nor anything innate) but the child’s own reasoning about what led to least harm. The data justifying a morality based on harm came from work done by Piaget, Kohlberg and Turiel. Turiel’s experiments involved telling children stories about harm and then asking them questions. He noted that children could distinguish between conventional rules and moral issues of harm. This suggested that it was reason rather than social construction that was responsible for the child’s moral development. Haidt not only doubted social construction but also our ability to reach moral conviction through reasoning. The moral conviction comes first, then the rationalizations. He aligned with Hume’s view of reason, quoting these words of Hume from A Treatise of Human Nature, “reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.” (Haidt, page 25) So where does this moral decision independent of culture and reason come from? If one removes culture and reason, what is left is something innate whatever that happens to be. This leaves open an area to explore. What does being innate mean? This brings us to the questions. Is this innate, intuitive source of human moral foundations in any way different from animal instinctual behavior? Clearly we are different from other animals and clearly we have similarities. How does our moral lives differ and how are they the same? Although Haidt discusses evolution the main use of his data is to reject reasoning and social construction. He limits his perspective to the human species. These questions are outside the domain of his data. This means one would have to look for answers to these questions elsewhere. Does there exist any research into non-human, animal morality? Such research exists. In particular see Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce’s Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals for a survey of the issues. Another place to look is plants. If there is a concern with keeping a distinction between humans and other animals with respect to morality, the issue magnifies when one considers if plants are also in some way at least more intelligent than we have assumed. There is research here as well. See Stefano Mancuso and Alessandra Viola’s Brilliant Green: The Surprising History and Science of Plant Intelligence. While recognizing we are different from other animals and plants, we do have similarities to them. We may need to rethink how similar our morality may be to how other species behave. 

This question applies to any type of multiverse or many worlds that translates or actualizes each of a set of potentials into a separate universe. These potentials may come from quantum randomness or cosmological fine-tuning or something similar. The “desperate” adjective is deliberate. I am asking if taking a multiverse approach to randomness implies science has given up on finding an explanation for the randomness, that is, there is a suspicion that an explanation cannot exist and the multiverse offers no other help in explaining the original randomness. The “agency” is deliberate. A random event could be viewed as some type of agent making a choice. I am aware of theistic arguments for God using fine-tuning, but the agents I am concerned with are more general. They need not be divine, but could be, say, a system of electrons or what Whitehead might describe as organisms. To limit scope, I am not concerned about a multiverse that is posited to get an infinite number of universes because ours appears finite in some way. That idea of a multiverse is not a translation of potentialities into actualized universes to remove the potentialities from consideration. It is just the idea that given the existence of our universe there may be many other universes similar to our own. Also, I am not concerned with the more general principle of plenitude although in this case all possibilities are also actualized. The multiverse ideas I am interested in seem to be offered to eliminate the possibility for agents to be actualized. They seem to me motivated more by a principle of parsimony at least with regards to possible agents. My suspicion is the answer is “yes”. I am looking for references to those who have already developed this idea or to “no” answers that would counter my suspicions. If the answer is “no”, what does a multiverse explain besides an interest in removing agency?
