You don't need to put anything in there. If you're really concerned get teflon coated cables. Those kinds of braze on cable guides were "standard" issue on well made lugged steel bikes until the early 80's or so. ( Cheap bikes can with bolt on versions of the same guides. ) They worked just fine even with old style cables that were much rougher than current cables. ( Current cables are pulled through a die to make them as round and smooth as possible and are also generally a much more rust resistant steel. ) 

One thing downtube shifters will let you know right away is if your position is setup with your weight too far forward. If you've got too much weight on your hands it will be very difficult to take one hand away without first sitting up. If you want to make life simpler, replace the cog set on the back with a more modern Freewheel that has hyperglide cogs. ( Sunrace is reasonably good and easy to find ). If you stick with the old stuff, you'll need to learn the art of slightly overshifting and then trimming back. Eventually, you will learn to shift either lever with either hand, or even both at once with the same hand. But it's simpler to start out by just using your dominate hand for both. While it's hard at the start, try and keep your eyes on the road and learn to shift by the sounds. Headphones and downtube shifters really don't mix very well. 

have a nice flat low profile cage that works well with cranks that resemble the older Campy with low Q-factor and relatively straight crank arms. Of course vintage Campagnolo is insanely priced, but you may be able to find similar Dura Ace or Sun Tour FD's that would work just as well. Also, another trick that can help is grinding the cage slightly to better match the curvature of the chainring. 

Short and simple... Nobody with the cash to spend on a high end touring bike thinks they are worthwhile. Given the increasing specialization in the bike market, they only reason they don't exist is nobody will buy them. 

My 2 cents. I have tried it both ways (50/34) with MTB cassette on the back 11-34 and a triple 26/39/52 and 12-27. In the long run the triple just works much better for me. I found that compact doubles (50/34) only work well if you can do almost all your riding in the big ring, except for the long climbs. Where I live and ride, I found that I was constantly having to double shift for the typical rolling terrain. I could never find the "right" gear for certain speeds. Also, on the very low end there is a fairly large gap in the low gears. The range of gears is pretty similar for both setups, it's the exact distribution that is different. I think if I could get a 48/30 compact double ( Orange Velo makes one) the compact double could work for me with a 12-27 cassette. You could try renting or borrowing a road bike with a triple to see if it's worth the extra cost for you. Unfortunately, road triples come with 30t as the lower gear, you can replace that with a 28 or 26 t gear. This makes it hard to really figure out if it's right for you, as 30/27 is not as low as 34/34. 

Drilling a crank that old is not a great idea. They weren't that strong to begin with and 40+ years of use hasn't made then any stronger. I would not do anything to further weaken them. To be honest, if the pedals are frozen I'd think twice about using that crank. Aluminum corrosion expands and can create stress that crack the material ( similar to the way ice can expand and split a crack in a boulder). All that aside, if you look hard enough you can find a "tripleizer" ring. This is a special inner ring that includes the mounts for a smaller inner ring. 

You don't need to replace the tire with a tire that is exactly the same ERTRO. And while ERTRO's are probably the most accurate tire measurement, they still aren't all that accurate. One manufacturers 35-584 can be slightly wider/narrower than another's. See $URL$ Unless the bike has very tight clearances ( unlikely for a Commuter bike) you should be able to use any tire in the range 30-584 to 40-584 ( or even larger). The only important number in the ERTRO designation is the rim size (i.e the second number). Panaracer makes some good relatively cheap 650B ( or *-584) tires[1] that would likely work well on that bike if you don't want to stick with Schwalbe. Schwalbe has a pretty nice range of 650B tires in "road" widths. If you search for 650B Road tires, you should get a pretty good selection of tires that will work for your bike.

"Women's" helmet is a pure marketing feature. All helmets have to pass the same safety standards and if it fits wear it. Most helmet models come in at least 2 or 3 sizes. You should be able to find a helmet in the size that fits your head diameter. All the major manufacturers make helmets for every head size from 2 year olds to XL for adults. Every helmet should have the head size range listed somewhere on the box. 

A bolt stays in place due to the friction applied to the threads by the tension in the bolt. In effect you are "stretching" the bolt so it constantly pulls on the threads to create the friction to hold the bolt in place. In the Brooks saddle case the force is actually a compression, but the principal is the same. As long as you put the tension back and check it on a regular basis, I don't think there should be any long term damage to the saddle. 

Time trials are about generating the maximum sustained power possible. Not many people can do that at 100+ rpm. Time trial gearing needs to match the rpm that the rider generates maximum power vs the terrain. A bigger chainring provides closer gear ratios. After all these events are won by seconds over an hours effort. Even the tiniest percent improvement in efficiency matters. 

I've been riding a 26 back, 27.5 front for about 4 years now. It works great for me. It does significantly change the geometry of the bike, but that is exactly what I wanted. I had a relatively upright XC bike and the change in geometry gave me a slacker headtube and longer wheelbase. This does make the bike less of a capable climber, but it's a much nicer descender. There are a lot of advantages to having a bigger wheel upfront. Would I have been better off just buying a bike with the geometry and weight I wanted? Maybe, but I would have spent a lot more money. Different wheel sizes have been used in Moto-X motorcycles for years. Humans probably aren't powerful enough engines really take advantage of this, but it can work. Bicycles have just about the right level of robustness and complexity to be fun toys to tinker with. If you've got the time and money, experiment. 

Improve the predicability of the friction of your tires. Studded bike snow tires will help the most with this, but even switching to a tire with a more robust tread and wider profile can help. Lowering the tire pressure will also help a little as this increases the contact patch and lets the tire conform better to uneven surfaces. Don't push the limits of what friction you have. These means generally riding slower, braking more gently and turning at slower speeds. Learn to react quickly and correctly when the friction does disappear. Find someplace safe and experiment with the limits of friction on snow. Make slow speed turns and try braking with both front and back wheels. Be very cautious with the front wheel, even at slow speeds loosing the front wheel traction can be a very hard fall. With practice you can learn to use your momentum to reestablish traction. 

Many modern MTB's are designed to only have a maximum chain ring of 44t or so. They are also designed for the relatively wide Q-factor of MTB cranks vs road cranks. 

Most sources I've read suggest that your body can process at most 300 calories per hour during exercise. And a lot of sources suggest that you only attempt to replace roughly 200 calories per hour at best. You should be able to do this easily without any simple sugars. Your initial budget is much much larger than 1500 calories, you don't need to do a one for one replacement. In endurance events your primary energy source is body fat, not muscle glycogen. You've easily got a 10K calorie reserve. I've done a fair number of Road Centuries and 8 hr MTB races over the last 10 years and overeating is just as bad if not worse than undereating. There are some companies/groups ( Hammer Nutrition ) that recommend avoiding simple sugars altogether and only consuming complex carbs. There's nothing that works for everybody and everything works for somebody. The only way to know is to try. One thing I've found that works really well for me is steamed mini potatoes with a little salt and olive oil. Eating and drinking a little bit as constantly as possible works the best. For a 6 hr ride, I'd focus more on proper hydration and a good balance of electrolytes. Unless you're at less than 5% body fat, you've got plenty of reserves for a long ride. What eating does is allow the body to use it's reserves[1]. Getting all this right is very tricky, most people err way too much on the side of over consumption. ( I know I've been guilty of this and it's led to some pretty terrible results. ). It's very easy to overthink and over plan all this, ( and there are certainly a lot of companies that will gladly take your money along the way. ) What you eat or drink is generally far less important than that you eat and drink something that agrees with you and that you like eating and drinking. You need water and electrolytes, enough calories to make them enjoyable is really all you need to worry about. [1]- This is just my own theory based on 35+ years of long days in the mountains, but often even just a tiny intake of food will yield a big jump in energy. I'm convinced the body "hoards" reserves until it detects an incoming supply of energy.
