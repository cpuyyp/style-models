Just tell your boss. Without having all the information, it's difficult to make a good decision. You may feel some of this will cause trouble for people, but if you want to send a coworker a text about work with someone you hardly know, there's little expectation of privacy. Management asked if you had spoken to Mavis previously, so I think they expect to know about any future contacts as well. You're caught in the middle. Mavis may have been a little hasty and regret sending you that message, but I think things can still be settled rationally if all parties wish. 

Since you identify the "right thing" as being best for both you and your boss, you better find out what her needs are. One position may be easier to fill than the other, so having you take the tougher one to fill may be in his best interest. Obviously, if you are not happy with the position given, you may be less inclined to stay with the company. Some bosses prefer to keep turn-over to a minimum. You need to have a conversation about this. Ask what his current thinking is. You have a 50/50 chance of getting the job you want without doing anything. You may find one position is more suited to getting promoted (assuming you want to be promoted). Your boss may have reasons to feel you are more suited for one than the other. One position may be more important/critical than the other and he prefers to have someone doing it that has been with the company and he trusts more. Maybe you need to get out of your comfort zone and stretch your skills to better prepare you in the long run? Much of this is going to depend on the relationship you have with your boss. The less open it is, the more difficult it may be to find out what she is thinking. You probably know more about this than any one of us. 

Does this mean you don't have allocated time specifically assigned to clean it up or does it mean it takes longer to debug or modify the code because of the way it was previously built? You need to consider this in your estimates. When people ask why a fix/change will take so long, remind them how hastily it was originally build, so now it's not as easy to work with as it should be. This is where the debt is costing the company. if not, then you have no technical debt. People and/or companies rarely change things if there are no consequences. It's great you recognize the technical debt, but you're not showing the problems it is creating for those decision makers. Hopefully, they'll hear you constantly having to delay things because of the poor quality of your current code base, that they may eventually suggest taking some time to do a better fix. 

You can ask for a range of salaries for different levels of skills and experience. If you see yourself as a Senior Developer, just use that as a starting point. Determining where you are on the scale is another matter. It's important to let recruiters know you don't want to waste anyone's time. Most management salaries are going to get negotiated, so I wouldn't put too much stock in a posted salary. At least I always hope my manager has strong negotiating skills when it comes to requesting my salary increase ;) 

I think these activities get taken seriously when management shows it is important and that usually involves investing money. It can come in the form of doing it on company time. Paying for activity/training fees, food, travel, etc. You could do both. An ideal situation for some people can be to do it off-site with some sort of lodging arrangements. It can be easier to get out of family/personal matters if you have to "be away for business." It's easier to focus without any office or personal distractions. When drinking is involved, it can be in a controlled environment, so no one is driving afterwards. A survey among the team members could be misleading. There will be those that do not want to do it at all and will just make an excuse whether you do it during business hours or afterwards. It's common to send people away for training, visiting remote offices, sales calls, conventions, so why not a team building session? Now you just have to make sure you do something worthwhile. 

Sit next to the other programmer and learn something. If she doesn't like it, she can find something for you to do. I don't think you've found out why this person is not helping you. Maybe she is too busy. Maybe she is protecting her territory. Maybe she thinks she's doing you a favor by taking all the work. There is only one way to find out and that is to ask. If your supervisors aren't confrontational, you better let them know you don't have billable hours before the client finds out. If all else fails, study, learn a new language, just look at the old code and refactor it. Doesn't matter if they never use it. You may have to get another job; be prepared. 

You can try to think about "What would the boss do?" and just go with it. Others may cooperate or they may not. Some may think you're taking the responsibility, so they won't get in trouble. It's up to you to decide if it is worth the risk. Unfortunately, this boss has abdicated his responsibilities and not effectively delegated them. Too many people don't know what to do. In many places, people just like to be explicitly told who is in charge when the boss is away. You could consider mentioning this to the boss and have him lay out some ground rules. Offer to be the one to take on the responsibility. Even if he picks someone, it can be difficult to put into place. For example, the boss may say you're in charge, but the company will not allow you to approve a purchase order or grant someone time-off. Another problem is if you do not have access to the information needed to make an effective decision. What do you do when a situation requires someone else's expertise? Will you defer to them and if so, do they feel like now they are responsible? Most of this boils down to the consequences of acting on your own. I've often been a new employee at many places and found that when the boss is not around no one will think, do anything or make a decision because they've been criticized for it in the past. Maybe I'm a little more thick-skinned and more likely to try and do the right thing instead of doing nothing. 

Academia - getting degrees and supervising others trying to do the same is pretty important in this area and very common. Required License - in many areas you cannot do a particular job without being licensed. Medical doctors, lawyers, CPA, and some engineers should always use these in professional settings. 

You will have to have reasons why they should pay you more. Think about this very carefully. Whey they give you the low offer, you will have to indicate you want more and again, be prepared to say why. You may get some type of response about this company being "locked" into what they offer new hires. What are you going to do? Decline? Take the offer, but look somewhere else? If I were them, I would push to see why you think you should get paid more than everyone else. Have you considered asking for other perks or benefits if they choose not to increase your salary? 

It can work both ways. A higher profile makes you a potential candidate for outside recruiters, but also makes your company more attractive to job candidates as well. Your increased connections on LinkedIn along with all the interesting work you're doing, are selling points for your company for future candidates. People will want to work with you and do the things you're doing. Talk to someone in your company and see what they are comfortable having you talk about. Maybe you're testing a new technology or learning a new language. Even something like upgrading to a newer version of an existing application. When a current employee is talking about doing interesting things, it is more believable than what is mentioned in job postings. This isn't going to prevent recruiters coming after you. Good employees are hard to find and many are currently employed. If you're company wants to take it too far to keep you "hidden" away, you may not want to stay with them anyway.
