It is not always the case that the composite of two operators is nice. In general, the composite of $S$ and $T$ is defined by $$ D(ST)=\{\xi\in D(T) | T\xi\in D(S)\}. $$ There is no reason to expect this space to be dense. I agree with @Yemon. You want the affiliated operators. Here's an interesting parallel for finite measure spaces that I heard in a mini-course from Ozawa. Just as $$L^\infty(X,\mu)\subset L^2(X,\mu)$$ which is a subset of all measurable functions, if $(M,tr)$ is a finite von Neumann algebra, $$M=L^\infty(M,tr)\subset L^2(M,tr)\subset \eta(M),$$ the affiliated operators. The inclusion for $L^2(M)$ into $\eta(M)$ is given by $$ \xi\mapsto (L_\xi\colon m\mapsto \xi m), $$ (be careful - you need to take the closure of $L_\xi$. Clearly $L_\xi$ commutes with right multiplication by $U(M)$) and the image of $L^2(M)$ is the set of all $T\in \eta(M)$ such that if $$ |T|=\int t dE(t) $$ is the usual spectral measure, then $$ \int t^2 d tr(E(t)) <\infty. $$ About your comment in response to @Yemon: Indeed the trace works. If you have a positive function, use indicator functons to show the trace is semi-finite and faithful (see Takesaki I). Normal is clear. If you have a measurable function $f$ on $(X,\mu)$, construct a multiplication operator by letting $$ D(M_f)=\{\xi\in L^2(X,\mu)| f\xi \in L^2(X,\mu)\}. $$ If $\mu$ is finite, and $f$ is a measurable, real valued, a.e. finite function, then $M_f$ is self-adjoint, and the spectrum is the essential range of $f$. Reed and Simon have a good introduction to unbounded operators, in particular the spectral theorem. Somehow the brackets aren't showing up for the sets above, but I hope it's legible. 

Just an addition to Pablo Lessa's comment. If probability to stay at a point is zero, then you have a simple random walk and the Reflection Principle is valid. So, your question will follow if you find the joint distribution of the maximum and minimum, as the simple random walk visits all points between them. The exact formula for the joint distribution of the maximum and minimum can be found in e.g. book of Billingsley, Convergence of probability measures, Chapter 2.11. The question can also be reformulated as the distribution of the first exit time from an interval [-a,b]. Then, another reference (for the zero-mean random walk) is this paper $URL$ of Kemperman, Asymptotic expansions for the Smirnov test for the range of cumulative sums. Ann. Math. Statist. 30 1959 448–462. The more general case (when probability to stay at 0 is greater than 0) can be treated similarly to the above references. 

1) I believe it is possible to obtain $P(M_n<a\ | \tau>n)$, where $\tau:=\inf\{n\ge 1: S_n\le 0\}$ in more or less explicit way only for the case of the simple random walk. These computations can be found in Billingsley, Convergence of Probability measures, Chapter 2.11. For large $n$ these computations become universal as you can apply FCLT, see below. 2) Generally, one can use Brownian motion approximations as was suggested by fedja. Mathematic justification is given in the references below. Before going into this I will say a few words about conditioning of random walks to stay positive. There are two ways to condition random walk to be positive. First way is to condition on $\{\tau>n\}$, where $\tau:=\inf\{n\ge 1: S_n\le 0\}$. Second way, is to ''condition'' on $\{\tau=\infty\}$. Here you cannot use direct conditioning as $\mathbf P(\tau=\infty)=0$ (for the zero-mean finite variance random walk). So, the way to proceed is to use Doob's $h$ transform. As a result one obtains a Markov chain (Lamperti Markov chain, in fact) which is a discrete-time analogue of Bessel process. Now I can move on to approximations as $n\to\infty$. a) When $a$ is of order $\sqrt n$, you need to use corresponding Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT). You need functional central limit theorem as the maximum depends on the whole trajectory of the random walk. The way to use functional limit theorems is described in the above Billinsley's book, you can see an example for unconditioned random walk in Chapter 2.11. For the first type of conditioning FCLT is proved in Iglehart, 1974, Functional Central Limit Theorems for Random Walks Conditioned to Stay Positive (doi:10.1214/aop/1176996607), see also Bolthausen, 1976, On a Functional Central Limit Theorem for Random Walks Conditioned to Stay Positive. Conditioning of the second type was considered in Bertoin and Doney (1994), On Conditioning a Random Walk to Stay Nonnegative (doi:10.1214/aop/1176988497). FCLT for the second type of conditioning can be found in Caravenna, Chaumont (2008), Invariance principles for random walks conditioned to stay positive (doi:10.1214/07-AIHP119). Finally, in higher dimensions you can use FCLT from $URL$ b) When $a$ is much larger then $\sqrt n,$ then $\mathbf P(M_n<a\ |\ \tau>n)\to 1$. c) When $a<<\sqrt n$ you are dealing with small deviations probability. If you write $\mathbf P(M_n<a | \tau>n)=\mathbf P(M_n<a , \tau>n)/\mathbf P(\tau>n)$, then approximation for $\mathbf P(\tau>n)\sim Cn^{-1/2}, n\to\infty$, and $$ \mathbf P(\tau>n, M_n<a)=\mathbf P(\mbox{random walk $S_k$ stays in (0,n) for all } 0<k\le n) $$ Now, if $a\sim An^{1/2-\delta}$ for $\delta\in(0,1/2)$ you can split this trajectory in $n/a^2$ parts of length $a^2$ and use independence to obtain estimate $$ \mathbf P(\tau>n, M_n<a)\le \left(\mathbf P(\mbox{random walk $S_k$ stays in (0,2a) for all } 0<k\le a^2)\right)^{n/a^2} $$ Now, the probability inside the parenthesis is on the right scale and you can apply the FCLT to get $$ \mathbf P(\mbox{random walk $S_k$ stays in (0,2a) for all } 0<k\le a^2)\to C(A)\in(0,1). $$ This results in the following upper bound $$ \mathbf P(\tau>n, M_n<a) \le C(A)^{n/a^2}\approx C(A)^{n^{2\delta}}. $$ As $C(A)$ is in $(0,1)$ this probability is quite small. . 

Note that $Prim(A)$ is always a set as it is a subset of $P(A)$, the power set of $A$. An important theorem: 

I believe (1 and 2) and (3) are mutually exclusive. Here is a proof: First, the commensurator $$ Comm_G(H) = \{g\in G : |\mathcal{O} _{gH}|, |\mathcal{O} _{g^{-1}H}|<\infty\} $$ is a group. We will show: 

I had never heard of table algebras before, but it seems to me that a subset of the table algebras is the abelian unital based rings in the sense of Section 2 of Ostrik's "Module categories, weak Hopf algebras and modular invariants" (MR1976459). Classifying abelian unital based rings is extremely difficult. For example, there are infinite families of rank $n$ abelian unital based rings for all $n\geq 2$ (e.g., near group fusion rings for $|G|=n-1$), and we don't know which rank 4 unital based rings (which are automatically abelian) are categorifiable. In more detail, a unital based ring consists of: 

@Todd Trimble is correct; a strict fusion category is just a fusion category that is strict as a monoidal category. (Being strict or being fusion is just a property of a monoidal category that can either hold or fail.) In particular, the pentagon axiom holds, where the associators are identities on the nose. Moreover, there is a version of MacLane's theorem for pivotal fusion categories, see Section 2 of arXiv:0503167v2. As someone who studies planar algebras, at one time I was very confused about this, and I think I know where the confusion lies. Let's focus on the fusion category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ where $\omega\in Z^3(G,\mathbb{C}^\times)$ is a cohomologically nontrivial 3-cocycle. The discussion below comes from a conversation I had with Scott Morrison which cleared up my confusion. We will give two realizations of the fusion category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$. The first has only one representative for each isomorphism class of simple objects. There are exactly $|G|$ many 1-dimensional simple objects denoted $V_g$ for $g\in G$, with fusion rules given by $V_g \otimes V_h = V_{gh}$, and associator given by $$ (V_g\otimes V_h) \otimes V_k \xrightarrow{\omega_{g,h,k}} V_g\otimes (V_h\otimes V_k). $$ The associators are easily seen to satisfy the pentagon axiom because of the 3-cocycle condition. Now there's also a planar presentation of $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$. Usually, when we talk about a planar presentation, we're working with strict categories, because drawing strings next to each other in the plane is associative on the nose. (One can get around this by bending strings closer or further from other strings, or by drawing coupons for associators, but let's not do this here.) The category $\operatorname{Vec}(G,\omega)$ has a planar presentation via oriented strands labelled by group elements (considering an oriented label the same as the reverse orientation with the inverse label), trivalent vertices 

They simply take the exact formula for the ruin probability of a simple random walk and use it as an approximation. Ruin probability of a simple random walk that jumps to $+1$ with probability $p$ and to $-1$ with probability q is given by $(q/p)^z$ if $p>q$. Then, take the random walk that starts at $u=Cz$ and jumps to $+C$ or $-C$ with the same probabilities. Pick $C$, $p$ and $q$ in such a way that the mean and variance of simple random walk are equal to that of the Gaussian random walk. This gives the following equations $$ C(p-q)=\mu $$ and $$ C^2(p+q)= \mu^2+\sigma^2. $$ Of course, $p+q=1$. Then the probability of ruin of this random walk will be $(p/q)^{u/C}$ and after finding $p$ and $q$ will be exactly the formula that you gave. Of course, this is not really a proof, just an explanation how one can obtain this approximation. I doubt that a rigorous proof exists. However, as $u\to \infty$, one can use Cramer asymptotics for probability of ruin. 

A II$_1$-factor is algebraically simple, so each morphism of II$_1$-factors is either injective or zero. Thus every non-zero morphism is an isomorphism onto its image. So $\phi: M \to \phi(M)$ is an isomorphism that takes $\phi^{-1}(N')$ to $N'$. I don't think the canonical surjection $G\to G'=G/\ker(f)$ actually gives you a map of factors $M\rtimes G\to M\rtimes G'$. In particular, if we denote the implementing unitaries as $u_g$ for $g\in G$, the map $u_g\mapsto u_{g\ker(f)}$ does not extend to a non-zero map of II$_1$-factors if $\ker(f)$ is non-trivial. The element $u_g-u_{g'}$ would map to zero if $g,g'\in \ker(f)$, and a non-trivial map of II$_1$-factors must be injective. 

It depends on the conventions that you pick, but if you pick them correctly, you'll get what you want. First, for a normal linear functional $f$ on $B(H)$, there is a unique partial isometry $v\in B(H)$ and positive normal linear functional $|f|$ such that $f=v|f|$ and $v^*v$ is the support projection of $|f|$, where we use the convention that $v|f|(a) = |f|(av)$ for all $a\in B(H)$. See Theorem 4.3.2 of $URL$ for more details on this. Suppose $x\in B(H)$ is trace class, and consider the induced normal linear functional $f = \operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,x)$ on $B(H)$. Now let's look at the polar decomposition of $x = u|x|$, which satisfies $\ker(u)=\ker(|x|)=\ker(x)$, so $u^*u$ is the support projection of $|x|$, and $u^*x=|x|$. Then $|x|$ induces a positive normal linear functional on $B(H)$, which we'll call $g$. One sees that for all $a\in B(H)$, \begin{align*} ug(a) &= g(au) = \operatorname{Tr}(au|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(ax) = f(a) \\ u^*f(a) &= f(au^*) = \operatorname{Tr}(au^*x)=\operatorname{Tr}(a|x|) = g(a). \end{align*} Thus $ug = f$ and $u^*f = g$, so we see $$ g(a)=[u^*f](a)=[u^*(ug)](a)=[ug](au^*)=g(au^*u), $$ and $u^*u$ dominates the support projection of $g$. We easily verify that for all $b\in B(H)$, $$ g(b(1-u^*u))=\operatorname{Tr}(b(1-u^*u)|x|)=\operatorname{Tr}(b(|x|-u^*u|x|))=\operatorname{Tr}(b0)=0, $$ so $u^*u$ is exactly the support projection of $g$. This means that if $f=v|f|$ is the polar decomposition of $f$, then by the uniqueness of the polar decomposition, we must have that $|f|=g=\operatorname{Tr}(\,\cdot\,|x|)$ and $v=u$. 

For fixed $t<1/\lambda$ it seems that intuition B is correct as $N \to \infty $. In this case, using the large deviations, one can see that it is highly unlikely that more than $(N+\varepsilon)\lambda t$ customers have arrived in time interval [0,t]. As there are $N$ servers and customers join the shortest queue it means that there will be empty servers and new customers will simply join them. Therefore, for $t<1/\lambda$ there will be a proportion of $\lambda t$ servers with 1 customer and $(1-\lambda t)$ servers with 0 customers. It might be good to have a look at N. D. Vvedenskaya, R. L. Dobrushin, F. I. Karpelevich, “Queueing System with Selection of the Shortest of Two Queues: An Asymptotic Approach”, Probl. Peredachi Inf., 32:1 (1996), 20–34, who studied a related system. 

You can find the asymptotics for this probability. For that let $$ \tau:=\inf\{i\ge 1: S_i\le i^\alpha\}. $$ Then, if $Var(S_1)<\infty$ then the asymptotics for $$ p_n=\mathbf P(\tau>n)\sim \frac{C}{\sqrt n},\quad n\to \infty, $$ see $URL$ for random walks with i.i.d. increments, and $URL$ for random walks whose increments are independent but not necessarily identical. In the latter case the answer is $$ \mathbf P(\tau >n) \sim \frac{C}{\sqrt{Var(S_n)} },\quad n\to \infty. $$ I have doubts about existence of a simple (and accurate) lower bound. 

In knot Floer homology case, the spin$^c$ structure $\mathfrak{t}_i$ corresponding to the integer $i$ is uniquely determined by the condition $\left<c_1(\mathfrak{t}_i),[\hat{F}]\right>=2i$, where we identify $Spin^c(S^3,K)$ with $Spin^c(S^3_0(K))$ and $\hat{F}$ is the capping-off of the Seifert surface $F$ of the knot $K$ inside the 0-surgery $S^3_0(K)$. Or equivalently, $c_1(\mathfrak{t}_i)=2i\cdot PD[\mu]$ holds where $\mu$ is the meridian of $K$. See subsection 3.4 in the first paper. In link Floer homology, the spin$^c$ structure corresponding to $i$ is uniquely determined by the condition $c_1(\mathfrak{t}_i)-PD[\mu]=2i\cdot PD[\mu]$, from the sentence below Definition 4.9 in the second paper. 

I have trouble matching the indexing conventions for Ozsvath-Szabo's knot Floer homology with link Floer homology. Say we have a knot $K$ in a 3-sphere. Then we can consider the filtered chain complex $\widehat{CFK}(K)$ of the knot, in which the filtration level is indexed by integers so that the $i$th associated graded complex has homology group $\widehat{HFK}(K,i)$. In link Floer homology, they use the notation $\widehat{CFL}$, but the two notions coincide in case of knots, so I do not distinguish them here. The indexing set is parametrizing the relative spin$^c$ structure $Spin^c(S^3,K)$, which has an affine $\mathbb{Z}$-structure, so that 

The answer to your question is given in Feller's book (Introduction to Probability Theory and its applications), Volume 2, Chapter 6, Section on persistent and transient random walks. In my edition, this is Chapter 6.X, Theorems 3 and 4. Theorem 4 says that a random walk with zero mean is persistent. Theorem 3 says that a persistent random walk visits every interval infinitely often in the non-arithmetic case and gives the corresponding statement for arithmetic random walk. 

This is just a bound from below. The derivation is a bit long for a comment. Clearly, a positive solution to the equation exists (although you need to specify in more details what happens when $X_1=0$ as $\lambda_1=0$ in this case). Now, we have \begin{align*} \sum_{j=2}^nX_{j} &= \sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{j=2}^n\left(\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \lambda_i\right)\ln (\lambda_j/\lambda_{j-1})\\ &=\sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i\left(\sum_{j=i+1}^n \ln(\lambda_j/\lambda_{j-1})\right) \\ &=\sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i \ln(\lambda_n/\lambda_i) \end{align*} Now since $\lambda_i>0$ we can make use of the inequality $\ln(1+x)\le x$ to obtain \begin{align*} \sum_{j=2}^nX_{j}&\le \sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i (\lambda_n/\lambda_i-1)\\ &=\lambda_n-\lambda_1+(n-1)\lambda_n \end{align*} Dividing both sides by $n$ and letting $n \to \infty$ we obtain by the Law of Large Numbers, $$ \lambda \le \liminf_{n\to\infty}\lambda_n, \quad \mbox{a.s.} $$
