Your textbook is wrong. To detect an informal fallacy requires intelligence. Whether this is natural intelligence or artificial intelligence doesn't matter much. An Artificial Intelligence that deserves the second part of the name has no problems detecting informal fallacies. Your textbook may find arguments why creating an Artificial Intelligence may be difficult. I doubt that it can find valid arguments why creating an Artificial Intelligence would be impossible. 

Your statement "they have horns" doesn't make clear whether you meant the variant 1B or 2B. If you meant 1B: The statement "all unicorns have horns" is true by the definition of a unicorn (a horse-like creature with a horn), independent of the existence of unicorns. Unfortunately, for exactly this reason "All unicorns have horns" does not imply that unicorns exist. If you meant 2B: A implies B and B implies A are both correct. However, the only logical conclusion we can draw is not that A is true, but only that A implies A. Which is a perfectly correct but useless statement. It shows that if unicorns exist, then unicorns exist. Well, that's called circular reasoning. 

A: Unicorns exist. B: All unicorns have horns. A: Unicorns exist. B: At least one unicorn with a horn exists. 

Fact is that if you do something meaning well, you should try to find out what the consequences of your well-meaning actions are, and make sure that they don't have unintended bad consequences. And if there are unintended bad consequences that make your well-meaning actions actually bad, then stop them. On the other hand, I don't think there was any slave owner who was cruel and made slaves suffer in order to encourage them to revolt and become free. (There may have been some who were well-meaning in a perverted way "encouraging" slaves through cruelty and suffering to stay in the place where they "belonged"). And if I remember correctly, slavery in the USA was not abolished by a bloody uprising of the slaves. If anyone knows history better than I do, they might give an example where slaves got their freedom by uprising. 

It is a "straw man" fallacy, since you never actually said for example that the Grand Canyon doesn't exist. So "straw man" is not wrong, the question is whether there is a more precise case for the circumstances, where the false argument is actually a misrepresentation of something you actually said. There is "Contextomy" which is basically misquoting what you said. If you said "race is entirely irrelevant to the brain structure", and this was changed to "race is entirely irrelevant", that would be "contextomy". You actually used all the four quoted words and in that order, but something essential was left out. In practice, you should never, ever let anyone get away with this. Your examples are not mistakes, but intentional mispresentations of what you said. So "I didn't say that" or "I didn't mean it that way" should not be your reply. Your reply should be "You are intentionally mispresenting what I said, you are a liar. " 

Your calculation is absolutely right, but doesn't mean much. For a clarification, assume the following experiment: I throw a coin that has head and tails. If it comes up heads, I leave it. If it comes up tails, I turn it around. Finally I check whether it ends with heads up: Yes, it does. Each and every time (because I turned the coin around every time it was tails). So I have a coin experiment E, and p (E) = 1. Now you have a theory H, which is true with probability p (H). The probability that your theory is true if my coin experiment succeeds is obviously exactly the same as the probability that your theory is true if I don't perform the coin experiment. p (H | E) = p (H). 

You will need to strike a balance. If you can't enjoy today, or tomorrow, or they day after that, or the day after that, ... you can't enjoy anything. You should think about foreseeable long term consequences of your actions, so that your actions today don't negatively affect your happiness tomorrow. But there are many things that you can't foresee - it's rather pointless to worry about them. And there are things that you can foresee but not change - it's also rather pointless to worry about those things. And if you try planning a very long time ahead, be aware that circumstances change. You might do X today so that you get Y in ten years time, knowing that having Y in ten years time will make you happy - and in ten years time, you don't actually care about Y anymore! On the other hand, there might be future things that you don't care about today, but that you care very much about when the future arrives. So a short summary: Be happy today. Don't do stupid things by ignoring the future. Don't do stupid things by overthinking the future. Don't let worry about the future make you unhappy today. 

That argument seems rather deluded. He says "It's wrong but then it isn't wrong". It may be true that it doesn't matter to the victim if one person does something wrong or another. However, it makes a difference to the person doing it, who is in one case guilty, and in the other case innocent. 

"Every element of the empty set is equivalent to a zebra" doesn't make statements about non-existing elements, it makes statements about no elements at all. That's a difference. When you say "statement about a non-existing element", you pretend that there is an element with the property "non-existing". But there are no non-existing elements. Logic must behave in a reasonable way. Think of any set, for example the set S with the elements 1, the empty set, a gnu, and a zebra. The statement "every element of S is a zebra" is clearly false - 3 out of four elements are not zebras. What happens when we remove elements? Removing elements may make the statement true. If we remove the 1, the empty set, and the gnu, then the statement can change from "No" to "Yes", it cannot cannot change otherwise. So if we have only the zebra left, then removing that zebra may change the statement "every element of S is a zebra" from false to true but not from true to false. Therefore a statement about all elements of the empty set must be true. 

It's an ad hominem attack that I fully agree with... The term "ad hominem attack" really stands for two things in practice. One, the logical fallacy that any fault in a person means that therefore what they say must be wrong. Second, a technique in a discussion where an argument cannot be attacked, and therefore the person making the argument is attacked. In this case, the argument isn't actually "ad hominem". The argument is that we have a highly biased source for an argument, and therefore we don't believe that the argument is trying to get at the truth, but to get at a falsehood according to the biases of the source. So the quoted person correctly denies that there is any value in entering a discussion, like there is no value in wrestling with a pig. 

You might read "The Second Variety" by Philip K. Dick. The premise of the story is that humans did - fully intentionally - build robots that could build replicas of themselves, and even improved versions, and were programmed to kill humans. Like Americans built robots programmed to kill Russians, and Russians built robots programmed to kill Americans. With this premise, the obvious question is: What could possibly go wrong? And the answer: A slight mistake in programming that stops the robots from distinguishing between Americans, Russians, and other people. No motivation, sentience, or consciousness required. And you wouldn't even need a mistake in programming. If these robots were programmed in a clever way, they might go and capture opposing robots and instead of destroying them, change their programming slightly. 

You can improve your argument: Instead of letting a computer calculate a result, and then calculating the result yourself, take one of the many problems where it is very difficult for even the fastest computer to find a solution, but reasonably simple for a human to verify the result. An example: It is very, very difficult to find three positive or negative integers a, b and c such that the sum of the cubes a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equals 30. A solution was found: a = 2,220,422,932; b = -2,218,888,517; c = -283,059,965. With pen and paper and a bit of concentration you can easily verify that these three numbers give a solution of the problem, but there is just no way that a human mind could find that solution. Assuming solipsism, there are two explanations: One is that for some strange reason, your mind finds that the sum of these three cubes is 30 whenever you do the calculation, but in reality it isn't. The other explanation is that your brain has a either huge computational capacity or an incredible mathematical talent that is completely hidden from your conscious mind. Both explanations seem weak. 

Very often an insane person is insane just in one particular way. For example, if I heard voices telling me that you are an evil alien who wants to destroy the world, and I believed these voices, that would be insane. But I could apart from this minor point of insanity be a completely sane and rational person, whose actions can be perfectly analysed by rational thought. (The rational thing to do would be to try and find evidence to convince others, in case of failure to assassinate the evil alien, or to figure out that I can't do anything about it and live my life ignoring the evil alien among us, and a person with that single one spot of insanity might do one of these rational things). 

If you consider unicorns to be mythical, non-existing creatures, then the proposition is true. If you consider unicorns to be rumoured creatures for whose existence no evidence has been found yet, then we can say that no observations have been made yet that contradict the proposition, but it is not proven. Consider the proposition "all yetis are beautiful". There will be many people who seriously claim that the proposition is false. And some will say that yetis are beautiful in their own unique way :-) 

If we look at animals, humans are intelligent, apes, pigs, dogs, horses are intelligent, chickens quite possibly. Whether flies or ants are intelligent is very debatable, and a bacterium or virus, no way (in my humble opinion). Searle's argument suggest that a human muscle operated "computer" might be able to simulate an intelligent conversation in Chinese, and we surely all agree that there is no way that Searle's room could be intelligent. We surely also all agree that there is no way that Searle's room could simulate an intelligent conversation in Chinese! It's just not a sufficiently advanced device for any possibility at all. From that we are supposed to conclude that a highly advanced computer cannot possibly "understand" the chinese text. This is like saying that because the bacterium cannot understand Chinese, therefore a human can't. This is not a reasonable conclusion. A modern computer could do what Searle's room does about 10 billion times faster, ignoring the fact that the man in Searle's room won't be willing to work more than 1/3rd of the time, which means that an answer that a modern computer could give in a second, would take Searle's room a thousand years. We are right now not capable of creating a rulebook that would make the Chinese conversation possible. By the time we can create it, computers will be thousand times faster. Would anybody be convinced that Searle's room, which isn't just a room but the interior of a huge skyscraper, operating for one million years, cannot do something equivalent to human "understanding"? 

You mentioned logic and emotions. You missed out on instinctive behaviour. In a very short time frame, when a very fast decision is needed, instinct takes over. Say you cross the road, and hear a car with screeching tyres coming around the corner. Logic: I could try to reach the other side of the road as quick as possible. Or I could (thought ends when you are hit by the car). Emotion: I feel good, but the noise of that car is annoying me. It also makes me feel fear and (thought ends when you are hit by the car). Instinct: Run. On the other side of the road there is time for emotion and logic. 

First, you are confusing "free will" with freedom to do as you please. "Free will" is about the question whether you are capabable of deciding out of your free will what to do, or whether you do what you do because you are just made that way. You can see it as a restriction of your free choice. But considering that my wife would want to punch you in the face if you refuse to interact with her, that everyone, white, black, whatever, would want to hurt the staff and the manager if they are not served in a restaurant due to their race, and that christians, muslims, hindus, atheists, would all want to put your house on fire if you refused to rent to the due to their religion, you would now have to make an argument why other people's choices should be restricted, and your's shouldn't. Your choice, if it were unrestricted, would provoke violent reactions. And we don't want that. At least in western countries, the situation is now such that if these actions were not restricted, you wouldn't have the power to avoid being punched, harassed, or your house set on fire. So we make laws to protect you from yourself and call it "moral". 

P → Q means: If P is true then Q is true. Implied is further: If P is not true, then I don't say anything about Q. P ∨ ¬Q means: At least one of the two statements P and ¬Q is true; they are not both false. If one of the statements in an "or" is true, then we have no information, no requirement for the other statement, because the whole "or" statement is already true. But if one of the statements is false, then this means we have a requirement for the other statement; the other statement must be true because they cannot both be false. So if P is true, then nothing is known about ¬Q. And if ¬Q is true, then nothing is known about P. But if P is not true, or ¬Q is not true (that is Q is true), then we have a requirement for the other statement. Compare with what I said about P → Q: "If P is not true, then I don't say anything about Q.". But now we have "If P is not true then ¬Q must be true". So one statement we have no requirements if P is not true, the other statement we have a requirement. Both statements cannot be the same. 

Simple really. The fact that you followed a principle in the past is not a reason to follow it again. The fact that you followed a principle in the past and it gave good results, that is a reason to follow it again. "We always did it this way". "Sure, we always did, and it never worked". Would you follow a principle that you used in the past and that never led to success? 

Answer these two questions: (1) Are "you" on the day of you birth and "you" one day before your death maybe in the 90's the same person? (2) If the answer to (1) was "No", then is "the same" meant in an absolute sense - can you be a little bit different from day to day and still be "the same", so that every day you are "the same" as the previous day, but after 90 years the changes have added up so you are not "the same" anymore, or would there have to be days where you were not the same? (As an example: My height today is "the same" as my height yesterday. Yet if I or my parents had written down my height in centimetres every day of my life, there would have to be about 120 or 130 days where the height written down wasn't the same as the day before). 

Bad things happen to people. Since there are many people, many bad things happen. Fortunately, most of the time they happen not to me. When you decide whether to believe in one God, or in several Gods, or in no God at all, you may take many things into consideration for your decision. You may take into consideration that bad things happen to people, or that bad things happen to good people. However, since you are just one of many people, whether bad things happen to you, or to others, should not influence your decision. So if you make a reasoned, well thought through decision to believe or not, then whether bad things happened to you or to others should not make a difference. So saying "I can believe in God if this bad thing happens to others, but not if it happens to me", that's bad philosophy. But there are some other things to consider. When you look at your life experience, you will not judge everything 100% correctly. For example, I think that the risk of slipping on a banana peel, banging my head on the floor, and dying from that injury, is not something that I take very much into account. If this thing happens to someone close to me, then I might change my opinion about how to judge this risk. That change of my opinion might be correct or incorrect, but it might cause me to change decisions that affect my life. So you can say "If I had known that there are banana peels around that kill people, then I wouldn't have believed in God. This event close to me made my rethink my beliefs in the dangers of banana skins, and as a result my believe in God", that's good philosophy. If you find out that your beliefs where based on incorrect assumptions, then you should rethink your beliefs. That's good philosophy. On the other hand, if bad things happen to you, then you might misjudge them and their importance because they have impact on you directly; you might not thing rationally, and this could cause you to change your beliefs in the wrong way. That's not exactly good philosophy, but it is human nature.
