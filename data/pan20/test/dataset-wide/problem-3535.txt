Run. Almost every day. Take your longest run, do that once a week. 3 times a week, do 1/3 of that time, and 2 times a week do 2/3 of that time. So if your longest run is 60 minutes, that would be 3 runs of 20 mins and 2 runs of 40. Speedwork - Incorporate (probably into one of your middle distance runs) sections of uptempo, faster running. Get used to running faster. Sleep/recovery - Make sure that you are properly refueling and getting plenty of sleep. Unless you have other obligations, unless you are training you should be resting/recovering, or doing light activity. 

If you are coming back from an eating disorder, then most likely you are not at your peak muscle strength, and that is probably what they are referring to when they say that gaining weight will help your swimming. I would not focus on your weight so much as I would on eating healthy, working out hard, and doing all the exercises and dryland stuff that your coach assigns. Your weight will stabilize naturally on its own. As a side note, congratulations on recognizing and taking steps to combat an eating disorder. I know some people that have done that, and it can be a tough road. Best wishes for you. 

You don't, unless you have surgery to move them. Insertion points, like everything else, are genetically determined. 

Just curious, why was surgery to repair the tendon not an option? As far as working out, I wouldn't worry about that too much, because that's a short term thing, unless you have a specific event (Your 'A' race for the season or something) that you are training for. 8 weeks is transitory, and yes, you might lose some fitness or a bit of muscle size during that time, but compared to a lifetime of activity, it's nothing. Whichever option gives you the BEST chance to get back to normal activity for the long term is the one that I would go with. Just as a personal example: I've been a competitive athlete since I was 4 (40ish years), and was in the middle of the current triathlon season, and ruptured my achilles in martial arts class 6 weeks ago. I had the option of either cast only, and letting it knit on it's own, or surgery to repair. The surgery was a longer rehab, more inactivity, but it gives me the best option to return to full, normal activity. So, figure out which option gives you the best chance to get back to normal, do that, and deal with the minor losses that you will have in 8 weeks. 

Ok, the last line of your post now makes it clear. The type of measurement that they are doing is called bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). These have an error rate of anywhere from plus or minus 5% on up depending on the quality of the unit being used. BIA can also run high or low depending on factors such as skin sweat, level of hydration, timing of your last meal, things like this. Hydrostatic weighing (When done properly by both tester and testee) and DEXA scanning are the two best methods for determining body fat. Next up would be a 9 point or 7 point skin caliper test, again dependent on the skill of the tester. Then 3 point caliper, circumference measurement and personally I place BIA at the bottom of the heap. BIA is good for trends over time, if you can manage to get on one at the same time in the same condition every day. Many Tanita or similar scales have the impedance built in, so you can weigh/analyze at the same time every day (Such as right out of bed). I would not place too much stock in the unit at the gym, as long as the weight and the mirror are both giving you good feedback, keep it up! 

I think that your best bet for this kind of arrangement is going to be a setup similar to many of the "fitness trails" that are available in many public parks. These are exercise/fitness paths that can be completed at a walking through running pace, with various stations at predetermined intervals to target various muscle groups and agility/power training, as well as balance and stretching. If you are interested in doing this yourself, it can easily be done by substituting for various things. Some of the exercises that I would absolutely include: Exercises for muscle building 

The biggest mistake that most uncoached runners make, is that they go way too hard on their steady, easy days and not hard enough on their hard days. And, as noted, that is a mid season type workout. Early season, you should be concentrating on just getting in miles for base, lots of easy pace, steady running. Tapering for races is more art than science, you will have to experiment and know your body to find what kind of taper schedule works for you. And, each time you run a race, use that time to recalculate everything. Macmillan Running has a nice calculator, and Cool Running has a good pace calculator as well, where you can play with times to see what kind of pacing you would need. 

Since your question gives the impression that you are at least a somewhat experienced person when it comes to exercising and working out, then there are two possibilities that suggest themselves. 

If you want to get to 240, go back on your 3500 calorie a day diet. If your weight keeps going up, then you know you are still eating a surplus of calories. If your weight doesn't go up, then you need to eat more. 220 lbs will require more calories to maintain, and so you may not see much (if any) gain on the same diet that got you to this point. One of your better options is going to be letting the scale tell you whether you are eating enough or not. 

First, let me address the misconception in your post. Your heel touching first is not necessarily heel striking. Unless your heel is still out in front of your center of gravity when the majority of your weight is on that leg (overstriding), you probably are not heel striking and are more likely already running either mid or forefoot. It has to do more with the loading phase of the run stride than it does which part of the shoe touches first. For your shin splints, or tibial stress syndrome, there can be many different causes, one of the most common of which is simply overuse. This can be caused by either markedly increasing your distance or your intensity in a short period of time. Shoes not fitted for your gait, or ones that are worn out and have compromised soles can also contribute. As Robin notes, there are other conditions that can produce or mimic the pain that is commonly called shin splints (Some of which can be serious), so you should have it checked by a pro. On a more personal view, I'm not a fan of Chi/Pose or any other trendy "run on your toes" style of running. Truly running on your toes is a sprinter style, and not really sustainable for more than sprint distances. I've seen more injuries from people trying to adapt to not letting their heel touch than actually paying attention to how they really run. 

It depends on what the force is that you are applying to the pedals, and the resistance that the bike is giving you. For a regular bicycle, it's a function of what gear you are in and the tire size. 4.3 meters per pedal revolution isn't in the realm of silly. The best thing that you want to find on an exercise ergometer is one that measures in watts. Because of various inefficiencies in the human system, watts can be pretty much converted straight over to calories. To find out calories, take your average watts, multiply by time in seconds, then divide by 1000. So, if you average 150 watts for 1 hour, you would get (150*3600) / 1000, or ~ 540 calories. 

Please note - This is pretty much for a road cycling perspective. If you do cyclocross or mountain/off road style biking, there will be a little more upper body engagement, and the equipment will be different. As far as the fitness goes, any aerobic activity done consistently will help you achieve your body and weight goals, so find activities that you enjoy. If you don't like it and "only do it for weight", then you will soon find excuses not to do it. If you do like it, you will find excuses to continue. Along with the exercise, you would need to take an honest look at your dietary choices, and make sure that they support and do not hinder your fitness/weight goals. It does no good to exercise if you keep eating fast food or similar junk items. Have fun and good luck! 

As Atul points out, creating a "standard" difficulty rating is not easy, as people have various level of skills, physical abilities and training. However, this problem applies to any sport that uses trails as a primary pathway. The International Mountain Biking Association has a basic primer on how to try this. Note, they only address technical difficulty, they don't assess elevation gain or trail length as part of it. That is presumed to be only physical, and unrelated to the technical skills needed. As far as finding places, there are any number of different websites that list trails, some have their own difficulty ranking system, a lot of races, but there doesn't seem to be a single codified source. (Unsurprising, trail running for other than recreation is still a very young sport). I'd try and find a site such as Trails.com or similar that lists trails in your area. Mapmyrun will also have a lot of individually made trails/maps, some may or may not have rankings along with them. 

Yes, yes and yes. Unless there are complications in the pregnancy, most of the time people should be fine to continue their normal activity level until very late in the pregnancy. For example, my martial arts instructor continued teaching classes and very vigorous kickbox aerobics until literally day of birth. (She finished a class and started labor 1/2 hour later). However, I would have her work with her ob/gyn on safe exercise levels and recommended activities. Ultrasounds and exams as the baby develops or other conditions that arise may complicate things. In a general sense, she should be able to be fairly active, but that takes into account no complications or other factors in the pregnancy. Encourage her activity, but also encourage seeking the advice of the ob/gyn as to what is safe for her. 

You can make an estimate using your VO2 max. If you don't have access to a lab to get it measured, you can estimate it using a couple of different formulae. 

As k.l. says, having a six pack is a function of both muscle structure and body fat levels. The "six pack", or 4, or 7 or 8 (etc) is basically just the abdominal muscles, with the connecting/support fascia making the indentations. (I say the other numbers as you have no control over how many divisions your fascia makes, it's genetic. I've even seen one guy with 10.) As a distance runner, it will be easier for you to cut body fat than it will be for less aerobic based activities. Attention to diet and timing, along with your normal training regimen (And I am basing this on the assumption that you train 5-7 days a week for running) will bring your bodyfat down. Abs start becoming visible around 10-15% bodyfat (Depending on muscle development and fat distribution), and sharply defined around the 5-8% level. Much below 5% is not recommended, as it is actually unhealthy to have that low a level for an extended time. Simply do a google search for "galen rupp abs" or "meg keflezighi abs" for some examples of distance runners with defined abdominals. 

Basically, just ride. Don't tear after it, just get used to the bike and being on the saddle for a time. I would suggest that for the first few times, at least until you get used to the bike and how it feels, that you stay close to home and do loops around a park or something similar. The last thing you want to do is decide "I'm going to go ride 20 miles", get 10 miles away from the house and find you can't ride any more. As you get more and more used to the bike, the exercise, how everything feels, you can start going longer distances, picking up the pace, do things like that. I would also strongly advise that you get a helmet, if you haven't already. Even for a 1 mile jaunt around the block, wear it. Anytime you are on the bike, helmet is on head. I've seen people fall over at a stop sign and crack their head open on the pole. IMO, bikes shouldn't be legal to sell without a helmet. 

Some of it is person dependent, but it's not the muscles that generally get injured. The things that tend to deteriorate are the joints, cartilage and bursa. These wear down over time, and can lead to injuries. Every sport/activity when practiced for a long time has its own "signature" injuries due to long time, repetitive motion. Golf, for example, has a long history of lower back injuries in later careers, due to the continued rotation under stress. Swimmers have shoulder problems, tennis/pitchers have elbow problems, etc etc. There are certainly acute injuries that occur, but the chronic and overuse/long time injuries are just due to the same wear and tear over and over. You can think of it as a hinge that gets opened and closed many many times, eventually the pieces just wear out. 

The reason that you were regurgitating slightly is mostly because of the slow squats. As you exercise, especially with exercises that require tight abdominal muscles, you increase the pressure in the abdomen. Slow squats will do this, especially after an hour of running (which also engages the muscles in the abdominal area). This has the effect of decreasing the volume of space available for the internal organs, which can start pushing items in the stomach in various directions until you stop compressing the area. While no food may be a recommendation, a lot of items will empty out of the stomach within an hour, some foods in much less time, so you will need to determine what and how soon before exercise you can eat. 

You're basically describing threshold and interval type workouts, which are the staple of many movement type sports (Running, swimming, cycling, etc). Threshold workouts are done at a slightly submaximal (or slower than a race pace) level, on short rest. These are designed to increase the amount of time you can spend at a certain level of exertion. Interval workouts are pretty much fullout, faster than your race pace level of exertion, with long rest between each interval. One isn't really "better" than the other, each serves a purpose. You could alternate them to be able to build both systems to where you want. Ideally you'd always be playing "catch up", but getting better all the time. One thing to think about, if you start getting to the point where you are tired on the maximal days, rather than slog it out at a slower pace, it might be better to just quit for the day. One of the cycling bibles (Training and Racing with a powermeter by Hunter Allen and Andrew Coggan, PhD) suggests that on interval type training days, if you are supposed to do X amount of work in Y time, but you only get to X-3 before you start failing to make your time, any more work won't be as productive as it might be and the extra rest would be more beneficial. Conversely, if you get to X and can still make it for X+z times before you fail to meet Y, keep on going. That way you don't overtire yourself on a "bad" day, and you take full advantage of your great days.
