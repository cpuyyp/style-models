There are several options for you out there, and many good amateur telescopes. I'll just throw some things out that may help in your search. Telescopes Brands I'd suggest going for something like a Celestron. They're well established and reliable from my experience. Aside from Celestron, this Vixen telescope has been rated as great for kids. What to look for Don't just go immediately for the telescope with the highest quoted magnification. Making something bigger isn't always the answer. If your image is blurry, magnifying it just gives you a big blurry picture. You'll want a telescope with a good combination of magnification (which can be changed based on your eyepiece) and aperture size (the size of the primary lens/mirror). In general, bigger = better when it comes to aperture size. Bigger means you collect more light and thus the object will be better defined. Usually, when a telescope lists itself as "XXX Telescope, 4 inch", that size is referring to the aperture diameter. As pela mentioned, there's also the possibility of getting telescopes with automatic tracking software and equipment. Keep in mind that objects in the sky are constantly on the move and this motion is magnified in a telescope. If you get your telescope pointed at an object, it may only take minutes or seconds before that object has left your field of view. Tracking equipment would be built into the telescope and will almost imperceptibly move the telescope with the motion of your object so that it can stay in your field of view for long periods of time. This is especially necessary if you intend to move into the amazing field of astrophotography. Binoculars Just to throw another option out there, often a good pair of binoculars is just as good as a cheaper telescope. You can still view many features on the moon, or see Jupiter's Galilean moons. If you go this route, I'd suggest getting a monopod or something to help you hold the binoculars steady. Note also this may be trickier for young children to properly view through as they may have a hard time sighting on a particular object. Star software It can be very useful to bring along, or have available, a computer with software that can tell you what is currently in the sky and where to look. Online examples (if you're at home with wifi) would include this planetarium or else the more robust Stellarium software. Viewing tips 

The simplest example astronomer's work with is the radial density profile of a Single Isothermal Sphere (SIS). It is called this because it is spherically symmetric (and thus applicable to a 2D plane for your purposes) and all objects orbit with the same velocity (and thUs have the same "temperature", hence isothermal). The density profile takes the form: $$\rho(r) = \frac{v^2}{4\pi Gr^2}$$ where $v$ is the rotational velocity. Note that you may see other formulations which use $\sigma_v$ rather than $v$. In this case they're using the velocity dispersion which is slightly different than the rotational velocity. Other, more realistic density profiles have been found by running simulations of the Universe and matching functional equations to the density profiles of the resulting galaxies. Such popular results are the NFW profile and the Einasto profile. The NFW profile is a two-parameter function, given by $$\rho(r) = \frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{R_S}\Big(1+\frac{r}{R_S}\Big)^2}$$ where $\rho_0$ and $R_S$ and two, halo-dependent parameters. The Einasto Profile is again a two-parameter model given by $$\rho(r) \propto \exp(-Ar^\alpha)$$ where $A$ and $\alpha$ are configurable parameters. 

The only possible case would be a system which doesn't technically have a star. It is quite possible that a system might try to form but just not have enough matter to get very big. The central object would try to become a star, but might not actually be big enough to start shining. We call these objects brown dwarfs. There are almost assuredly systems which have no official stars and the central body is a brown dwarf that every other body in the system orbits around. Whether you want to consider this brown dwarf a "massive planet" is a bit hazy. 

Note that this only covers part of the sky because the rest of it is blocked by the disk of our galaxy. I understand how an expanding Universe explains the symmetrical redshift, but I fail to understand how it explains the symmetrical increase of nebulae density. I'm interpreting this to mean, you're wondering how the "formula" with expansion included can produce the result that "the numbers of nebulae increase faster than the volume of space through which they are scattered". This I think is more or less a math question. If you're really interested in seeing how it was derived, feel free to look at Hubble's original paper: Hubble, E., Tolman, R. C., Astrophysical Journal, 82, 302, 1935. I think you'll find the summary equations in Section 12 (page 328 in the paper, page 27 in the pdf) with lengthy derivations before that. 

Edit: I didn't expect such a spirited debate in response to this answer. First off, I want to say that none of my arguments above are bullet-proof. I'm going to incorporate some of the comments below to help round out this answer. This will be easier than creating a long conversation of comments. 

The only potentially valid way to cause a long-lasting eclipse that I can think of is to have your moon orbit at the planet's L1 Lagrange point between the planet and the star (and the moon has to be the right size). If it had just the right orbit and was the right size, it could then cause a long-lasting eclipse. Note I'm not saying permanent because such a system wouldn't be permanent. I'm not going to run through the math$^1$ to determine if such a system is stable or for how long. I'd guess it may be stable for a few orbits at least. The main problem is getting your moon there in the first place. One could conceivable say that by some freak chance a third fairly massive body came close to your planet/moon (either from outside the solar system or near the edge) and gravitationally perturbed your Moon's orbit such that it ended up in the L1 point. But the chances of such an event are so slim that it would be incredulous if it actually happened. And just to add a technicality, once your moon moved to the L1 point, it would now be orbiting the Sun and wouldn't be a moon anymore according to the definition of a moon. 

Yes that is correct. According to current definitions of what counts as a planet, there are 8 planets orbiting our Sun $-$ Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. There are also a collection of smaller "Dwarf Planets" which include (in no particular order): Pluto, Ceres, Eris, and Makemake. There's also a lot of other minor solar system bodies out there like asteroids, comets, etc. 

Left: Image of the corona during a solar eclipse. Right: Image of the corona from SOHO. An occulting mask has been placed over the Sun. The atmosphere of the Sun extends far beyond that though. In fact, Earth is currently moving through the Sun's atmosphere. It's very tenuous out near Earth, but still exists. The Sun's atmosphere hitting our planet is the reason for aurora. Beyond the lower portions, the atmosphere is generally referred to as the Solar Wind. This solar wind actually extends far out, beyond Pluto even. Exactly how far is difficult to define, but estimates place our Sun's atmosphere extending out to about $\sim230\:\mathrm{AU}$. At that point is the bow shock, where our Sun's atmosphere slams into the interstellar medium surrounding us. Our own Sun's atmosphere is hard to study on a large scale since we're inside it, but we have been able to observe this bow shock around other stars, as shown below. 

No such planet has been announced as having been discovered. The paper only shows evidence for the 7 (really 6 because the 7th can't be officially confirmed with only 1 observation) terrestrial planets and does not make the case for any other planets. The paper doesn't indicate that more planets could exist, but does remark that there are large error bars on some of their data, leaving room for uncertainty. Ultimately, I think we can cross off a gas giant existing in this system for a few reasons. 

I went over to NASA's LAMBDA server and found that SPT data was hosted right here. Look to the left-hand side menu to see the links to raw data for the SPT-SZ and SPTpol instruments, individually. The University of Chicago hosts their data right here (props to called2voyage). It seems that they provide publications and include any data used in that publication rather than just hosting all the RAW data like the LAMBDA server does. Use whichever is most convenient for you.

I know you've already accepted an answer, but I feel that it doesn't provide a true representation of the type of image processing astronomers actually do. Actual image processing in astronomy is rarely done with JPG, PNG, or TIFF files. Instead, astronomers mostly work with FITS files and cameras/astronomical instruments actually produce FITS files when taking images. The advantage here is that FITS files can record much more information than just image information such as where/when the image was taken, multiple layers of the image, encoded WSC information, etc. As part the mission objective of various organizations such as the National Science Foundation and NASA, all raw astronomical data taken in the United States by observatories funded by the United States are free and open to the public (after a limited time period in which the observing scientist gets exclusive rights to the data for their science objectives - usually several months to a year). This includes both ground (e.g. Keck, SDSS, Arecibo) and space observatories (e.g., Hubble or Spitzer). This is also true of many observatories funded by other countries as well. A great place to start would be to head over to the Hubble Legacy Archive. Enter the site and try searching for an object or coordinates. For example, you can search for M101 (otherwise known as the Pinwheel Galaxy). You'll see a list of images come up and next to them, you can download the FITS file generated by Hubble when it took the image. Another great resource would be the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This is a systematic astronomical observation of as much of the sky as possible using a variety of instruments. You can practice looking at images and spectra. I should warn you that it will take a bit more effort to figure out where the data is and how to interpret it, but feel free to ask questions here when you run into trouble. In general though, if you're looking for a particular type of image or data, find an observatory that records it and look for their publicly available data sets. 

So short answer, yes your system is possible but it comes with some constraints and is likely not going to be stable for a long time period. Habitability You also ask about the habitability of such a system. This is a bit tricky and there's no single answer. There are so many conditions that affect habitability. To make matters worse, we only have a single example of a habitable planet. However, there are general conditions we believe must be true for a planet to be habitable (for humans at least). The big condition is that your system must be at a good temperature such that water can exist as a liquid. If your central planet is a Jupiter/Saturn analog, this is not going to happen since such planets have large, mostly hydrogen gaseous envelopes. There's not really any pools of water for humans. However, your moons could still host water. It really depends on how far out your planet is from the star. These types of planets form very far from the star, where water doesn't easily exist as a liquid so either your planet must migrate in to the inner stellar system early on (and stop at a respectable distance), or else some sort of tidal effect has to keep your moons much warmer than they would be other wise (see Enceladus, for example). The former means your chosen moon orbits are likely to be less stable and the latter means you're going to need other moons to help provide the heating, again making your orbits less stable. If your central planet is Earth-like, it can certainly host water and be as Earth-like as you want, but the moons are unlikely to be big enough to be habitable. There are various other conditions for habitability such as nice atmospheres or magnetospheric protection from the star but one could write a whole book on this subject. I'll leave off by pointing you to this question on habitability.
