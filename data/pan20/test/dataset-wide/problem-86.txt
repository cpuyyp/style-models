I think it is impossible for a planet to develop only one life form. If we look at earth the entire planet has a sort of balance, where the development of one form life is stopped by another, none of them getting to be fully disruptive. From this balance the competition emerges, and intelligence at some point evolves. Of course once humans evolved and we got very intelligent compared to all other life forms, we got to a point where our population dictates the balance. But absent the competition there is no need for intelligence (which is costly from an evolutionary point of view), so your aliens would not think anything of the actions of humans because they would be unable to think (that if they could evolve like this, but I doubt they could). 

Do you actually need it to be very deep underwater? If you just want it to be hard to find, you can place it in remote shallow water (well, not really shallow, but something like 100 meters deep). Somewhere near Greenland, or Antarctica would work, if you want to place it firm on the bottom. It's not like there are millions of scuba divers in these places. It might be better not to complicate the story with unnecessarily fantastical elements. Also take into consideration that you are underwater, so you need an earthquake inactive area if you build on the seabed. 

Make them extremely religious. They are directly created by a God, so they are in touch with divinity. They are keepers of the righteous belief and the return of the God is directly linked to the "spark of belief". Then you can introduce a "satanic" group that they battle, or if other intelligent species exist (like normal people) they can fight the decadent inferior competitors. Or the "humans" rebel and do not help them maintain the belief in the God and they need to fight to crush the rebellions. You created a very interesting introduction with a direct manifestation of divinity. Why not use it to motivate them? That way you can link the very creation of new ones to their need to fight now (they need to keep the religious belief in their God so he will return and make more). The future reward justifies the sacrifices now. 

Let's take these one at a time, starting at the top. Urban Development This is what we're asking about, so we'll give it a pass for the moment. Social stratification This could simply be a result of human psychology rather than an essential trait of civilisations; after all, one could argue that by that definition, societies that are least theoretically democratic or meritocratic were not 'civilisations'. However, happily, you mentioned that most pods are oligarchic, so we can probably give this a point in favour. Symbolic communication forms I would argue no on this. Ephemeral art that will be washed away with the tides really is less a form of communication, more a form of self-expression; it's about the artist, not the audience. Unless they have some more permanent way to record the thoughts of great dolphins, this is a point against. Perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment Again, the ephemeral nature of their art and creations argues against this. I suppose they may farm kelp or coral to increase their food production, but there's only so much you can dominate the surface of the sea. One against. One out of three isn't a good score. Let's go into detail with the remaining common features: Centralisation Oligarchical politics and ministries for various tasks suggest this gets a point in favour. Domestication of both [dolphins] and other organisms No information on their farming practices, so I can't award a point either way here. Specialisation of Labour Again, unclear. The existence of ministries would suggest perhaps? Half a point in favour. Ideologies of progress and supremacism Uknown. Monumental Architecture No architecture at all. Point against. Taxation Unknown Dependence upon farming Unknown, but it's hard to imagine how pods could farm. I'll mark this as half a no. Expansionism Without construction of any sort, it's hard to imagine borders that could be expanded. Still, it's possible that a large pod could forcibly integrate a smaller...I'll leave this as unknown. Score 2.5 in Favour 5 Unknown 3.4 against. I would suggest that without some form of permanence, you cannot have a true civilisation, and that's the big problem here. These dolphins don't make permanent homes, they don't create permanent art, they don't alter their environment...these the hallmarks of civilisation, and they just don't meet them. 

Genghis Khan's tomb has not been found. He requested that, so they made a deep hole, placed him in then put back the ground, didn't put any sign and story says that they went with their horses in every direction, trampled earth both while going to the dig site and after finishing the burial going away. And did that so randomly that after time passed it was impossible to trace them back. If you want to keep something hidden, don't put signs saying "don't open this", put it somewhere no one can find it. It is generally a Hollywood go to stupid plot this thing of "warnings from the ancients". When people want to hide something or keep it away, they do just that, they don't make it easy to find and then write "don't look inside". So my question is: is it so important for your plot to have them write something there and so perpetuate a stupid stereotype or you can concentrate your story on the actual building of the tomb and on its secrecy? Because if you don't concentrate on writing useless stuff, you can make it simple by creating a stone prison and then bringing mud and dirt and planting trees and so creating a "natural" looking hill. Like the Chinese did with their pyramids, but in your case it would be an intentionally forgotten, never spoken about place. And the release of this ancient evil can be done by accident (your present time civilization can dig a tunnel there for a highway or whatever). 

Crop Failures Our food supply is shockingly vulnerable. $URL$ Something like 50% of the world's caloric intake is based on just three crops - wheat, rice, and maize (corn). Something that destroyed those crops - a disease or fungus, say - would shatter industrial civilisation, and would certainly result in widespread famine. A few rogue biologists might find (or even create!) the pathogen or whatever that destroyed the crops, and thus might see this coming well in advance, but it would be exceptionally difficult to shift production to other crops fast enough or in sufficient quantity to avoid the disaster. Ecological Collapse The ecosystem depends to a surprising degree on a few keystone species. These are species that affect their environment to a great degree, like a top predator that controls the numbers of large herbivores (wolves in Yellowstone), or a creature that modifies its environment to create niches for others (beavers). Some of these species are vital to human society. Bees are a favourite recent topical example. Again, a pathogen that severely reduced the population of a keystone species could well lead to a social collapse. 

Do your research Identify several sites near your proposed destination (temporally and geographically) from which fossils have already been recovered. It doesn't matter so much what kind of fossil it is, as long as it would have been there at the time of your trip. Ideally you're looking for sites with extremely well-preserved, intact skeletons, since you know that those areas will remain undisturbed until the skeleton is found. Preserve your message Others have mentioned amber as an excellent material for preserving your message; another good choice would be inside an eggshell. Amber and eggs are always examined during digs, so your message should be found and identified. Use distinctive materials You'll want to carve your message into a material that wouldn't normally be found in the area where you'll be burying it. Igneous rock in a sandstone area, for example. This will ensure that your message stands out from the surrounding rock, and that it's easy to remove the rock matrix from your message tablet. So, take your message, carved into a piece of granite and stored inside a dinosaur egg filled with sand, and bury it directly over the remains of a dinosaur you know will be excavated in the future. Make sure you've actually carved the message into the stone, not just scratched it onto the surface. Then sit back and profit! ...Or just plan ahead If you want to be absolutely certain your message will be received, and received ONLY by your own people, you have an even simpler method available. Identify a formation of sedimentary rock without too much folding, and make sure you can identify the same region when you go back. When you're ready to send your message, carve it into igneous rock (as described above), pack it into an eggshell with sand or clay to protect it, and bury it in the region you'd previously identified. You KNOW this formation will remain intact, after all. After you've gone back, your research team can return to the formation you'd already arranged to use and dig through it for your message. 

A ship that would not have a very important component with a lot of redundancy that would awake crew to save it is not plausible. It is just bad planning. Of course you could have automatic ships, but then you would not scout the possible systems with colony ships, you would have drone ships that report info back and the first contact would be with something like that and not a colony ship. A story where humans manage to do in a limited time something that the creators of that ship could not do is not believable if the intended audience is over 10-15 years old and is interested in tech. 

The ship had a critical failure somewhere in the solar system. A vast majority of the on board population was lost to this. The minimum crew is awaken by the ship, they initiate contact with humanity as they need help (manpower and resources). They are generally peaceful but the ship is capable of significant defense. This because if they are not peaceful we are easy pray and if they cant defend at all then they are easy pray and on both cases no standoff for intrigue can be made. You can have a plot conflict between humans who want to help them and cooperate and humans who just want to capture the ship, kill them and take the technology. Sub-plot intrigues can be made with the timing of discovering certain elements, like how many are left, how good the defense is, how opened they are to communication etc. Evolve the story into something where the ship is rebuild, some sort of technological transfer is made, humans join them, maybe in an extended and rebuilt ship that would properly sustain both populations. you can have a sequel with the voyage to the other world and stuff like that. 

There's a somewhat exaggerated, but still essentially true, story out there about why the solid rocket boosters on the space shuttle were the size they were. The story is that the diameter of the rocket boosters was selected because they needed to be able to reach Cape Canaveral from the Thiokol factories in Utah by rail, and the rail route had to go through tunnels, so the diameter of the rockets was determined by the size of the tunnels. The size of the tunnels was determined by the gauge of the rails that had to go through them. And the gauge of the rails was determined by the gauge of pre-rail tramways which were built by the same people. And the gauge of the tramways was decided by matching the gauge of pre-modern cart wheels. And that gauge came from the wheels having to fit into the ruts in the road. And the ruts in the road were originally made by Roman chariots, which were built to fit between two horses' backsides. The thrust of the idea is that humans tend to copy what worked before, and quite often this results in odd sizes and measures being preserved when there's no technical need for them any more. Whether this would be the case for ammunition being manufactured After the End when guns are being rediscovered is kind of a toss-up. It will depend on a lot of factors, like whether people are trying to rebuild guns from scratch or to reuse old parts, whether they fully understand the reasons behind some of the design choices made in earlier products, whether they're working within an existing infrastructure or making it all up themselves, etc. 

I do not know exactly what kind of story you want to build, but as others said, the chance of success is so small that it cannot seriously be taken into account. If you want a more credible story I would suggest that you modify it to something like: 

I don't know about anything else, but you would need genetic engineers to modify the humans that land there. Radius twice the size of earth would mean a mass tens of times bigger then Earths (I am to lazy to calculate now), and a gravitational acceleration significantly bigger than Earths. Also, the atmosphere would be very thick, people could not breathe that air. Actually I think that at this mass, the planet would be to heavy to be considered a rocky planet, and it would be a gas giant (a little on at that). As such, the humans could not survive there. But if it would not be a gas giant, if they would first go to the moon, set up there, build up a larger colony and then they would genetically alter themselves they could go on the planet next. So for this genetic manipulation you would need genetic engineers. And there is another problem. Normally you would send a ship with a lot of resources first if you go a short distance like to Mars, then a colony ship with only what is needed for traveling safely. This because you can wait to see that the first ship got there safe, the load was not damaged and the people have the equipment. If it fails you just send another ship with equipment. That way you don't risk the lives of the people with some extra heavy ship in one round. This is what happens with the ISS now, we don't send extra heavy rockets with all that the astronauts would need for the entire period with them, there is a stash there and it is constantly replenished by unmanned missions (which are safer in term of potential human loss). This makes your scenario more improbable, as the ship would not carry enough equipment. You would send such a complete ship only if it goes a long distance (to another system). 

Quick note: Only hoatzin chicks have claws on their wings; these claws are lost after maturity. What pressure could lead to further development of claws? Well, it appears that the claws have emerged because of the pressure of local predators. Hoatzin chicks will run away from the nest when the alarm call is given, using their claws to climb more effectively. They'll also drop into the water, then use their claws to climb back up to the nest. Thus once the chicks are able to fly, they no longer exhibit the behavior that encouraged them to emerge in the first place. You'd need a use for those claws in adults to encourage them to be retained and developed further. Perhaps a flightless species of hoatzin might develop a need for hands for the same reason primates have them - climbing and gathering food. Finding a food source that benefits from more dexterous tools than just a beak might be a good stimulant for such a change as well. 

This is the Severn bore in England. The water on the right is the normal, downhill flow of the river; the water on the left is the incoming tide, flowing uphill. Tides are a pretty complex phenomenon, but the important part (for our purposes) is that the gravity of the Moon is causing water to flow differently on Earth. Let's define 'downhill' as 'towards sea level'. That's generally what it refers to. In that case, to get a river to flow 'uphill', or away from sea level, all one needs is a temporary or local effect that draws the water up along a slope in order to balance itself out. For instance, if a river encountered a gentle ridge that had a very, VERY, VERY dense object inside it, it might be pulled up to the top of the ridge, briefly flowing uphill, then drop away in a waterfall on the other side. Another possibility is something called a Hydraulic Jump. This happens when fast-moving water reaches a slow-moving body, such as when a waterfall or rapids meet a slow-moving stream. The pressure of the fast-moving water forces the level of the slower-moving stream upwards, which could cause the river to briefly flow uphill.
