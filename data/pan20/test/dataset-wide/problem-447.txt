To help humans by helping the environment. The robots spend their time cleaning and maintaining natural fresh water like lakes and rivers, since fresh water is a basic human need, and maintaining it is an on going activity. The company encourages this since the robots are far more likely to wear themselves out doing this AND it makes the company look good that the robots default to green activities and environmental protection. 

It would depend entirely on what they were engineered from. Since they cannot procreate they would never be given higher than subspecies. Thus they would have a Trinomen or trinominal name. The subspecies name would be determined by the first paper published concerning the organism. If they were engineered from humans for instance the would be Homo sapien X X being whatever the original researched decided to use. It could be fred if he wanted, Homo sapiens fred. Lets use JDluosz's idea and use angelos So assuming it was engineered from human stock, that would make it Homo sapiens angelos 

Bog iron has been used for a long time, all you need to harvest it a sharp stick and a shovel. Of course if it is a new planet, there are probably plenty of exposed surface deposits, so they would not need to mine as much as just keep an eye out and maybe do some searching. we have to dig on earth becasue everything on the surface has long since been harvested. smelting ore can be fairly easy provided there are not trying to make high grade steel. you can see a reenactment here, $URL$ 

That is entirely up to you. we are not really sure why art evolved, the best guess at this point is that it is a way of putting your intelligence, creativity, and skill on display. A mate can't just see your intelligence it needs to be displayed with some activity. Your creatures may not have art or may have art in the form of sparing dance, weapon creation, or even landscape drawing. It might have the full human form we enjoy with all its diversity. their proclivity for war will not have much impact whether they have art it will just affect the content of their art. FYI the first art we know of for humans were giant hand axes, exaggerated oversized(to the point of uselessness) examples of everyday tools that help display the artist's skill in stone knapping. 

short answer they wouldn't talk or think, domesticating an organism in the way you describe involves making it stupider so will follow orders and not make its own decisions. An organism smart enough to talk and think as humans do will never be domesticated, eventually it will get angry and frustrated at being unable to do what it wants and attack the one responsible. Most animals are unsuitable for domestication because they value their own desires and ideas more than your company, an intelligent creature by definition has to put high value on its own decisions. 

ground sloths might be a good choice, they went extinct only very recently in some parts of the world. The hard part is getting them to africa. so you might want to have a pangolin following a parallel evolutionary path. 

stone may or may not be common in a swamp, it depends on the swamp. The most common construction technique you see in swamps is to build on stilts. wood is plentiful so they build out of that. If stone is common you can build from stone and wood anchor pilings like venice. Water travel becomes the main way to get around that and foot bridges. You may want to look at venice for inspiration on layout if not construction. It is not that stone is hard to find in swamps as much as it tends to shift and sink into the muck. So you can decide which way you want to build. Clean water is difficult, you either need to boil water to drink of have pipes to drill deep wells. flooding tends to be only bad once people start building levees to redirect water (it concentrates flooding instead of letting it spread out over a large area), if natural flooding cycles are allowed and people build on stilts only the most extreme storm flooding will bother anyone. Keep in mind new orleans was a city before it had pumps, they just tended to build on the high ground. some stilt villages can be quite extensive. 

the main limitation on manned vehicles is g-force on the pilot, in space anything that has to keep a human inside alive will be laughably easy to shoot down. so you need to change that, either make piloting remote, which could be interesting in and of itself, or create technology that protects the pilot in some way, anything from force fields to nanotech enhancement would work. now pilots can do things and live. most space battles will be about trying to turn your ship to minimize the target you provide and point your weapons at the enemy, think naval battle in 3D with broadside being the opposite of good. now having more ships gives you an advantage you can spread out and force the enemy to expose their flanks. the more ships you can launch and the more kinetic weapons they can fire, the harder it is for the enemy to dodge, since you just can't provide good armor against fast moving dumb projectiles over the entire ship without cooking the crew alive. upside defensive tactics are few and far between. Vast 3D space mean picket lines don't work, so you have lots of reasons for your characters to be on the move hunting targets. surviving multiple hits would be normal, point defenses and distance means you need to overwhelm the target, not rely on lucky shots. although a personal favorite of mine is the invention of the equivalent of railgun canister shot will make for a very one sided battle. the other big aspect is in space they biggest thing limiting your fighting is how fast your ship can shed heat and how much heat build up it can tolerate, becasue everything you do generates it and it is hard to get rid of. worse yet radiators which are the best way to get rid of it are very fragile and have to be to work. So whoever can fight the longest before they have to start extending radiators wins. stealth is impossible, you just can't hide in space. worse if you try to make your ship stealthy it just makes it easier to overheat. worse I don't need to hit you to kill you I just need to make you fire your defensive lasers enough for you to cook yourself or surrender. I really recommend you look at the space war section for the guys over at atomic rockets, they are a fountain of ideas, calculations, and reality checks. $URL$
