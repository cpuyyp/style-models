Denmark was mostly "liberated" by a surrender of German armed forces in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany, and Denmark to British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery This took place on May 4, 1945 at Luneberg Heath, Germany. This surrender was initiated by the Flensburg government in nearby Flensburg, Germany, under Admiral Karl Doenitz, who had been appointed as Hitler's successor in Hitler's last will and testament (the Navy was the one branch of service that had not disappointed Hitler). The Bornholm Island, well east of the rest of Denmark, was occupied by Soviet troops on May 9, 1945, notwithstanding the earlier surrender of Denmark discussed above. 

Post-World War II Poland was "designed" by the British foreign office, presented by Churchill, and ratified by Roosevelt and Stalin at the Tehran Conference in 1943, as noted in another answer. After World War I, Britain had planned on the so-called Curzon line for the eastern boundary of Poland (based on the ethnic divisions) but the country crossed that boundary in 1919-20 and seized chunks of Belarus and the Ukraine east of that line from the Soviet Union. The 1939 German-Soviet partition line actually coincided almost exactly with the Curzon line, with minor differences. Hence, it was easy for Britain and the Soviet Union to agree on the final eastern boundary of Poland. In compensation, Churchill's plan was to restore to Poland land that had been "German" for two or three centuries, but had been Polish earlier in the Middle Ages. These included Silesia and Pomerania. As a practical matter, the new western border was set on the Oder and Neisse rivers, meaning that some small pieces of German (East) Brandenburg east of the line went to Poland, and some small pieces of former Polish Pomerania went to Germany. Silesia had originally been Polish, was inherited by the heir to the Bohemian crown, and ultimately by Austria, when the Bohemian royal line died out. It was captured by Germany (Brandenburg-Prussia actually), in the War of the Austrian Succession in 1740, which is why it became "German." All this over a period of several centuries. Pomerania (Polish for on the sea) was originally held by Polish dukes. When they started accruing land west of the Oder in the 12th century, this portion of Pomerania was held as a fiefdom under the Holy Roman Emperor. Eventually, the German influence won out, and all of Pomerania was under the Holy Roman Empire, or one its Electors, that of Brandenburg. During the Middle Ages, there was a certain amount of back-and-forth, but the end result was increasing German settlement and influence on Pomerania, particularly west of the Oder, less so under the east, while nominally under a Polish noble line, the Griffins. When they died out around 1650, Pomerania was divided between Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia, with the latter eventually absorbing the Swedish portion over the next century or so. All of the above as justification for the Allies doing what the wanted to do, transfer these lands from Germany (back) to Poland, and the Soviet Union taking back the pieces of Belarus and the Ukraine occupied by Poland. 

Short answer: The latest flareup is the most recent of many that have taken place over the centuries. More details are found in this wiki article on Catalonia. But basically, Catalonia was always the "non-mainstream part of Spain. It formed the heart of the Kingdom of Aragon, which was united to the rest of Spain (Castile) by the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile. Even though the couple "officially" ruled Spain "jointly," they were actually ruled separately by the two rulers and their respective staffs. Catalonia rebelled in 1640, along with Portugal, which won its independence from Castile. Spain barely recovered Catalonia because the alternative was even less palatable French rule. Catalonia rebelled again against French-controlled Spain during the War of Spanish succession, and on more than one occasion during the nineteenth century. Finally, Catalonia was the heart of the "Republican" side of the Spanish Civil War; most of "Castile" north and west of Madrid supported Franco. Bottom line: Catalonia always felt itself to be a different, almost "separate" part of Spain even when technically under Spanish rule. 

One example: the wave of German (and other European) immigrants that came to the United States in 1848 were referred to as the "Forty-Eighters." And the gold miners who went to California in 1849 were known as the "Forty-niners." So yes, each century refers to their own contemporaneous "Forties," "Fifties," etc. 

The 1929 stock market crash (and the excesses, bordering on illegality that led to it) led to the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1934, following the onset of the Great Depression in the early 1930s. $URL$ There were Congressional acts, those of 1933 and 1934 that changed the way that companies accounted for, and more importantly reported their financial results. The Act of 1933 dealt mainly with beefed up reporting requirements. The Act of 1934 established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enforce the 1933 Act. It also gave the SEC to regulate the offering and sale of securities such as stocks and bonds. As such, the oversight of the SEC greatly reduced (although it did not totally eliminate) a number of "shady" practices perpetrated by companies and stock brokers on unsuspecting investors. As such, 1933-34 represents a watershed for corporate accounting to investors. The reduction of the "Big 8" accounting firms to the "Big 4," culminating in the collapse of Arthur Andersen (earlier the fifth) in 2002, due to the Enron scandal, may have been the harbinger of the new 1930s. It created a shortage of "large" accounting behemouths, but contributed to the rise of a group of smaller, hopefully more effective accounting firms. One book (written by yours truly) that discusses the original 1929 stock market crash, the 1930s Depression, and the possibility of a new crash (like the one that took place in 2008), and a possible return to the modern 1930s is $URL$ 

This theory is at least plausible. This Economic Encyclopedia makes the claim that Hoover might have been the real father of what we now call the "New Deal," and notes that "Many Democrats, including FDR, saw him as a potential presidential candidate for their party in the 1920s." While Hoover was a Republican, he was also noted for his "Progressive" tendencies in the manner of both FDR and the other Roosevelt, Teddy. That set him somewhat apart from Harding ("Back to normalcy") and Coolidge ("The Business of America is Business.") and made him acceptable to left wing northern Democrats (less so to conservative Southern Democrats). Mitigating the timing somewhat is the fact that in 1920, Hoover was age 46, and no one that young had ever been elected for the first term up to that time. (Teddy Roosevelt had "inherited" his first term from McKinley, while John Kennedy, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama who were elected President at the ages of 43,46, and 47 respectively, were decades in the future.) Hoover was a much more plausible candidate for the 1924 and 1928 elections (he actually ran in the latter year). FDR himself, was something of a surprise choice as Cox's Vice-Presidential candidate because of his age, 38 (four years earlier, and he would have been ineligible to run). But he had federal level and international experience that "balanced" Cox's "local" (Ohio) credentials. 

Mexica is the Nahuatl or "Aztec" name for the original group of "Aztecs." Over the course of several centuries, these "Mexicans" conquered the whole Central Valley of what we now call "Mexico," thereby creating the "Aztec" empire. "Mexica" is the core of this empire. The Spanish added chunks of modern Mexico (and central America) to the Aztec empire, which is why today's "Mexico" is larger than the original Mexica. Other names for the country like "America" were considered, but the "USA" had beaten "Mexico" to the punch. Even Spanish-speaking "South" American nations might have disputed that name.
