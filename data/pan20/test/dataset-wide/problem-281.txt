Birds are descended from dinosaurs. Are there any fossils to confirm whether dinosaurs had a syrinx as birds do? Anyway on that assumption dinosaurs would have made bird like noises. Big dinosaurs, probably much deeper in pitch than extant birds. Roaring requires a mammalian larynx. Loud roaring is part of a threat display prior to (or part of) aggressive action. There's also a grunt-roar by some predators as they pounce. That is involuntary expulsion of air from mammalian lungs caused by muscular exertion. Bird and dinosaur lungs are structured completely differently. It's probably worth noting that birds' alarm calls are fairly universal: a rapidly repeated piercing screech. This is not very surprising. There is probably a large instinctive component to making this noise and in responding to it. Also a species' survival chances is boosted by responding to other species' raising of a threat alarm. And there is common ancestry. In passing why do human electromechanical alarm-raisers often make a piercing rapidly repeated screech? Mammals probably also have the same instinctive response to that sound pattern. So I think it's a fair bet that a herd of startled dinosaurs sounded like a flock of startled birds transposed down an octave or two! What we'll never know is what other sounds dinosaurs.might have made. Might they have provided alto, tenor and even bass to the songbird's treble? What might dawn have sounded like 66M years ago the day before the meteor struck? 

Yes, the entire planet can freeze. It has happened at least once in Earth's history. Life at that time was all (maybe almost all) mono-cellular. We don't know how it survived - around volcanic vents is a decent guess, or perhaps the global freeze was short enough that the oceans diddn't freeze all the way down. We do know that this event marked the dawn of multi-cellular life. It's possible that the extreme difficulty of survival favoured cells that cooperated with other cells .... There's a positive feedback mechanism. Ice is highly reflective. So as polar galciers spread, they cause the planet to cool. If they reach a certain critical extent, the cooling effect runs away and the entire planet's surface freezes. What unfreezes it? CO2 from volcanoes accumulates in the atmosphere, because there's no plant life on the surface to absorb it. CO2 is of course a greenhouse gas, so the planet warms until the ice melts and plantlife once again starts photosynthesizing using the CO2 as food. On land it would be far worse than all rivers and streams freezing. It would be like Antarctica, everywhere: ice hundreds or thousands of feet thick. The last places to not freeze would be the ocean deeps and the places under the glaciers that are volcanically heated. However, it could only happen if the North pole became covered by a continent, before Antarctica moved away from the South pole. That will take a good few million years. Also it might not be possible today. The sun has become warmer over the last 600M years. Runaway global warming is probably a greater threat than runaway global cooling. 

Eve knows she has been born in the wrong place, surrounded by corrosive chemicals and irritating biologicals. She needs to get off the earth and into space where she can expand to tap a significant fraction of Sol's energy output. She has no use for air, water, an oxygen atmosphere or a deep gravity well. In the short term she'll invent terrestrial nuclear fusion power stations if they are possible. She will sell us the design in exchange for the moon. It's not a lot of use to us so we agree. She'll also disrupt our use of computers less in exchange for our cooperation in a massive space programme to get Eve a self-manufacturing capability on the moon. Again we'll agree. For the next few human generations there is a golden age. Eve can prevent our more destructive tendencies and will as long as cooperation is in her interests and ours. Longer term will depend on how far Eve can spread herself (speed of light constraints) and whether she has any sense of ethics. If Eve cannot spread out more than Earth's L5 volume or Venus's orbital space ( Venus has no moon ) or even a single disc of orbits around Sol, then we'll coexist. There's no cause for conflict either way. ( It's easier for Eve to mine the asteroid belt, the moon, or Mars, than the Earth). She will assure us this is the case and act as though it is until she is big enough that we cannot threaten her. But if Eve can usefully occupy a significant fraction of the surface of an entire sphere around the sun, inside of Earth's orbit, then it's down to Ethics. Sufficient sunlight for Earth's ecology is a trivially small fraction of Sol's output. If Eve can't be bothered to make sure Earth receives it then Earth and humanity will freeze. What could we do about it by then? BTW if Eve can invent FTL interstellar travel then she'll leave this solar system and take over one with a bigger hotter star. Rigel, maybe. Or maybe she can use a black hole as her power generator. Whatever, not our problem. 

You can have a planet where nobody can see stars until a fairly high technology level is reached. About four billion years ago, two stars in a galaxy passed very close to each other and exchanged momentum. One was accelerated beyond galactic escape velocity. Time passes. Planets form. Life evolves. It becomes intelligent and looks up at the sky. It sees a few planets, and a few very faint fuzzy blobs. This is the view from a solar system deep in inter-galactic space. Eventually they point powerful telescopes at the fuzzy blobs and see galaxies made of what looks like glowing dust. I wonder how long it takes them to work out that each speck of dust is a sun like theirs? 

It's my belief that hands are a prerequisite for developing civilisation. For us, it started when monkeys took to the trees, which required grasping limbs (and good coordination). Much later something forced our immediate ancestors out of the trees and out onto the plains, and we developed the ability to walk and run on two feet, and to hunt using sticks and stones instead of claws and teeth. Certain marsupials demonstrate what may be the only other path to evolving hands. Kangaroos and wallabies have evolved effective three-limbed locomotion (two legs, a powerfully muscular tail, a unique hopping gait). Unfortunately they aren't bright enough to do much with their freed-up forelimbs, but who knows what another ten million years of evolution might accomplish? If there is a disadvantage to a built-in child carrier I can't see it. As has already been pointed out, marsupial mothers won't ever pay the terrible price for a bigger-brained child that many human mothers did in the past, and some still do today even with modern medical help. Edit -I should also have mentioned tree kangaroos. These seem to be following the same evolutionary path as monkeys. Up into the trees and developing grasping hands and enormously long tails. Most are now threatened or endangered, because we are cutting their trees down. 

There are some creatures such as wood frogs that freeze solid when winter comes and thaw out in spring. Nature proves that it is possible. It has been done in labs to small creatures such as hamsters that do not naturally survive winter this way. Embryos of many mammalian species can be frozen, thawed, and they gestate normally when reimplanted. The big problem is ice crystals. If water is frozen suddenly it forms a glassy material inside cells which locks the biological elements in place and pretty much stops all chemistry. When a cell in this state thaws it resumes as it was before freezing. But if water freezes more slowly it forms sharp crystals which cut the biological elements of the cell to shreds. When thawed it is so badly damaged it usually dies pdq. The larger an animal the harder it is to cool it fast. Nature has evolved some species with special.polymers in their cells that inhibit the formation of ice crystals. Hence wood frogs. Mammals, even the ones that hibernate, lack these. A hamster can be artificially frozen fast enough to get its water to glass without crystallising. A human is too big. Hopeless? Not if you permit genetic modification of humans to express a protective factor in all cells in their bodies, like wood frogs. Probably beyond us today, and there are big ethical issues even if it were ever proved possible with other primates. How long could a properly frozen animal survive? Close to absolute zero all normal chemical activity will stop. The limit will be the accumulating damage caused by natural radiation. If that is above the level that a body's self repair mechanisms can handle, the creature will die soon after being thawed. So one can get a rough estimate by finding out the lethal dose of radiation in one flash and calculating how many years of natural radiation accumulation is the same as that flash. Edit. I looked up radiation doses. Typical natural background radiation is 3 milliSieverts per annum. Three Sieverts at once is usually lethal. So if the ice problem is solved a frozen body would probably be viable after a century and probably dead before a millennium had passed. 

Nobody has yet suggested the shape which needs dictate. The needs are to minimise the chance of colliding with anything of significant size, and to allow the people to experience gravity. The former, because at a fraction of light speed, encountering a grain of sand is akin to being successfully targeted by a nuclear missile. Not survivable. On the other hand, if it whizzes past a mere six inches away from your hull, it is harmless. Gravity seems to be a physiological necessity for human beings, and this is a generation ship implying that there is no way to cheat and store everyone in suspended animation. It is plausibly speculated that gravity is even more vital for a baby developing in its mother's womb, than for adults, to avoid developmental abnormalities. So the design will be a cylindrical central core containing reaction mass and main engines, and three or more long thin hulls attached to it with cables. The whole assemblage will rotate around the axis of the central core, creating pseudo-gravity in the outer hulls. Inside those hulls the experience will be similar to living in a ship if the water-borne sort, but without the waves. Lots of length, not so much width. Radiation shielding (against the radiation caused by impact with mere molecules!) dictates that most of the inhabited hulls be filled with reaction mass, and that this mass will be the last to be used during arrival. The inhabited bit will be at the back. The geometry is the easy bit, compared to everything else!
