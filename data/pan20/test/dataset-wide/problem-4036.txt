This has the rather easy answer: No! Let $G$ be a finite group of order divisible by $p$ that has a $p$-block $B$ of defect $0$ and let $M$ be the unique simple $kG$-module in $B$. Take $H$ to be any nontrivial $p$-subgroup of $G$. Then $k_H$ is a submodule of Res$_H^G(M)$, as $k_H$ is the unique simple $kH$-module. So $M$ is a submodule of Ind$_H^G(k_H)$, by Frobenius reciprocity. But $M$ is a projective $kG$-module. So $M$ is a direct summand of Ind$_H^G(k_H)$. Now by the last paragraph in my posted question there is a $kH$-homomorphism $\phi$ of $M$ such that t$_H^G(\phi)=1_M$ and $\phi$ factors through $k_H$. So $\phi M\cong k_H$. But Res$_H^G(M)$ is a projective $kH$-module and $k_H$ is a non-projective $kH$-module (as $p$ divides $|H|$). So $\phi M$ has no submodule that is a direct summand of Res$_H^G(M)$. 

I. G. Macdonald gives a very explicit formula for the coefficients in Example 24, p35 of the 2nd Edition of Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials. The example begins `Another involution on the ring $\Lambda$ may be defined as follows...' 

Look at I2.24 (an exercise!) in the book I.G. Macdonald, Symmetric Functions and Hall Polynomials, 2nd Ed., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995. Let $\lambda$ be a partition. Then for sufficiently large $n$ there is a corresponding conjugacy class $K_\lambda(n)$ of $S_n$ (got by ignoring $1$'s in $\lambda$). Use $+$ to denote the sum of the elements in the group algebra ${\mathbb Q}S_n$, we may write $$ K_\lambda(n)^+K_\mu(n)^+=\sum_\nu c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu(n)K_\nu(n)^+, $$ where the $c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu(n)$ are non-negative integers that depend on all $3$ partitions and on $n$. Say that each element of $K(\lambda)$ can be written as a product of $\ell(\lambda)$ transpositions, but no fewer. Throw away the $\nu$ for which $\ell(\nu)<\ell(\lambda)+\ell(\mu)$. Then the resulting $c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu(n)=c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu$ are independent of $n$ (H. K. Farahat, G. Higman, The centres of symmetric group rings, Proc. Royal Soc. London A 250 (1959) 212-221.). Now let $H(t)=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-tx_i)^{-1}$ be the generating function for the complete symmetric functions. Suppose that $H(t)$ has Lagrange inverse $H^*(t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty h_n^*t^n$. Then the corresponding symmetric functions $h_n^* $ are algebraically independent. Set $h_\lambda^*=\prod h_{\lambda_i}^*$. Denote the dual (w.r.t. the usual symmetric bilinear form on symmetric functions) of $h_\lambda$ by $K_\lambda$, for each partition $\lambda$. Then Macdonald shows that the $K_\lambda$ form a basis for symmetric functions whose multiplication constants are: $$ K_\lambda^+K_\mu^+=\sum_\nu c_{\lambda,\mu}^\nu K_\nu. $$ 

It seems to me that all answers to this question will involve the symmetric group. Here is one example from the representation theory of $S_n$ over a field of characteristic $2$: $$ \prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^i)^{-1}=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^{2i})^{-2}\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{n(n+1)/2}. $$ The left hand side is the generating function for partitions - the coefficient of $x^n$ is the number of partitions of $n$. The right hand side reflects the way the partitions of $n$ split into $2$-blocks of partitions, according to their $2$-cores. The $2$-cores have the form $[n,n-1,\dots,2,1]$ giving the sum on the extreme right. The other infinite product refers to pairs of partitions, and arises from the enumeration of partitions in a block using a $2$-abacus. Now this equality rearranges and simplifies to $$ \prod_{i=1}^\infty\frac{(1-x^{2i})}{(1-x^{2i-1})}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^{n(n+1)/2}. $$ The left hand side ranges over all partitions with all even parts distinct; a partition with $e$ distinct even parts contributes $(-1)^e$ to the sum. So for $n$ not a triangular number, the number of partitions with an odd number of distinct even parts must equal the number of partitions with an even number of distinct even parts. This is not obvious to me, but it recalls Euler's famous pentagonal number theorem. More generally, let $t>0$ and let $c_n$ be the number of $t$-cores of $n$. Then $C_t(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_nx^n$ is the generating function for $t$-cores. Apart from $t=2$, there does not seem to be any simple description of $C_t(x)$, although it is known that $c_n>0$ for all $n$ and $t>3$ a prime. Then the $t$-abacus idea gives $$ \prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^i)^{-1}=\prod_{i=1}^\infty(1-x^{ti})^{-t}C_t(x). $$ 

Let $S$ be an affine scheme. Call a group scheme $G\to S$ linear if there exists an $S$-group morphism $G\to \mathrm{GL}_{n,S}$ with trivial kernel. Assuming this, suppose $H\to S$ is a central closed subgroup of $G$ and that the quotient fpqc sheaf $G/H$ happens to be representable by a flat group $S$-scheme, also denoted $G/H$. My question is whether $G/H$ linear in the previous sense? I am willing to impose various assumptions such as regularity of $S$, smoothness of $G\to S$, flatness of $H\to S$, and that $G$ embeds as a closed subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_{n,S}$, but I want to avoid assuming that $G$ or $H$ are reductive or limiting the dimension of $S$. Note: The question of linearity of arbitrary smooth affine group schemes had been discussed here; it is open in general. I am asking in the hope that perhaps something more concrete can be said about quotients of linear group schemes. 

Let $\mathbf{X}$ be a Grothendieck topos and let $A$ be an abelian group in $\mathbf{X}$. Verdier's Theorem allows one to describe $\mathrm{H}^n(\mathbf{X},A)$ in terms of hypercoverings, namely, as the colimit of $\mathrm{H}^n(U_\bullet,A)$ where $U_\bullet$ ranges over the category of hypercoverings (of the terminal object of $\mathbf{X}$). One can further form the Cech cohomology $\check{\mathrm{H}}^n(\mathbf{X},A)$, which is the colomit of $\mathrm{H}^n(U_\bullet,A)$ as $U_\bullet$ ranges over hypercoverings with $U_\bullet=\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet)$. Let me call them Cech hypercoverings. (These are the hypercoverings with $U_n=U_0^{\times (n+1)}$ and the standard simplicial structure.) A well-known spectral sequence relates the derived-functor cohomology with the Cech cohomology, implying in particular that $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathbf{X},A)$ is canonically isomorphic to $\check{\mathrm{H}}^1(\mathbf{X},A)$. I am not absolutely certain, but it seems correct that under the description provided by Verdier's Theorem, the isomorphism $\check{\mathrm{H}}^1(\mathbf{X},A)\to \mathrm{H}^1(\mathbf{X},A)$ is the obvious one, namely, if a Cech cohomology class is represented by a $1$-cocycle in $Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$, then its image in $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathbf{X},A)$ is the cohomology class represented by that $1$-cocycle. The latter statement means that for a hypercovering $U_\bullet$ (not necessarily Cech) and any $1$-cocycle $\alpha\in Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$, one can find a Cech hypercovering $U'_\bullet$ and $\alpha'\in Z^1(U'_\bullet,A)$ representing the same cohomology class. I am looking for a way to construct these $U'$ and $\alpha'$ directly. The main problem is that $U_\bullet$ cannot be refined to a Cech hypercovering in general. An alternative approach to the problem (which also applies to non-abelian $A$) is via the correspondence with $A$-torsors. It is a standard fact that $\check{H}^1(\mathbf{X},A)$ is in 1-1 correspondence with isomorphism classes of $A$-torsors. Explicitly, if $\alpha\in Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$ with $U_\bullet$ being a Cech hypercovering, then the $A$-torsor $P$ corresponding to $\alpha$ can be described by $$ P(V)=\{a\in A(U_0\times V)~:~ \alpha_V \cdot d_0^1a =d_1^1 a\} $$ where $d^1_i:A(U_0\times V)\to A(U_1\times V)=A(U_0\times U_0\times V)$ is induced by $d^1_i:U_1\to U_0$. Suppose now that $U_\bullet$ is an arbitrary hypercovering (not necessarily Cech). The question will be resolved if one can show that $P$ constructed above is still an $A$-torsor. The difficult thing to check is that $P\neq \emptyset$. (However, when $U_\bullet$ is Cech, one can check that $\alpha\in P(U_0)$.) 

Let $G$ be a locally compact unimodular group with center $Z$ and let $\omega$ be a unitary character of $Z$. To fix the discussion, an irreducible unitary representation $\pi$ with central character $\omega$ is 

Question: how does one enumerate all star-convex $2n$-vertex sublattices of the plane that have the unique domino-tiling property? Definitions: A subset S of the xy-plane is star-convex if there is a point s in S such that the line segment [st] is contained in S for every t in S. For example the Young diagram of a partition is star convex with s taken as the origin. A sublattice G of the plane is a bipartite graph whose vertices are some points in the plane with integer coordinates. Two vertices in G whose x-coordinates differ by 1 or whose y-coordinates differ by 1 are joined by an edge. A tiling of a graph by dominos (dimer covering or perfect matching) is a collection of edges such that every vertex belongs to exactly one edge in the tiling. Motivating example: For $n\geq1$ there is a bijection between the Young diagrams of $2n$ which have a unique tiling by dominos and two copies of the set of partitions of $n$. We see this as follows: Represent the partition of $2n$ using beads on a $2$-runner abacus (as explained in James & Kerber's book The Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group). Moving a bead on a runner into a space immediately above it on the abacus correspond to the removal of a domino (2 adjacent boxes) from the diagram. The Young diagram has a tiling by dominos if and only if there are an equal number of beads on each runner (the partition has an empty 2-core). The tiling is unique if one runner is the bead sequence of a partition of $n$ and the other runner represents the empty partition. Specific Examples: For $2n=2,4,6$ only the hook partitions $[k,1^{2n-k}]$ have a unique tiling by dominos. In addition to the $8$ hook partitions of $2n=8$, the partitions $[4,3,1]$ and $[3,2^2,1]$ have unique tilings. These correspond to the partition $[2^2]$ of $n=4$. 

Higman's Criterion is a fundamental result in the representation theory of a finite group $G$ over a field $k$ of characteristic $p>0$. One version is the following (I hope the notation is standard enough): Let $M$ be a $kG$-module and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,{\rm Res}_H^G\, M$ if and only if there is a $kH$-endomorphism $\psi$ of $M$ such that ${\rm tr}_H^G(\psi)=1_M$. Question: suppose that $M$ has a $kH$-endomorphism $\psi$ such that ${\rm tr}_H^G(\psi)=1_M$. Does $\psi M$ contain a $kH$-submodule $L$ such that $L$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ and $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,L$? Motivation: Notice that if $L$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ and if $N$ is a submodule of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ containing $L$, then $L$ is a direct summand of $N$. As a consequence, if $N$ is a submodule of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ which contains $\psi M$, then $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,N$. The standard argument proving the `if' implication in Higman's Criterion appears to show this consequence directly. This seems to me to be a mysterious property of $\psi M$, at least if my Question has a negative answer. Going back to generalities, let $M$ be a $kG$-module and suppose that $M$ is a direct summand of ${\rm Ind}_H^G\,N$, where $N$ is a $kH$-module. One version of Higman's Theorem produces a $kH$-endomorphism $\phi$ of $M$ such that $t_H^G(\phi)=1_M$. This $\phi$ `factors through' $N$ in the sense that it is a composition $\phi=\phi_2\circ\phi_1$ where $\phi_1:{\rm Res}_H^G\,M\rightarrow N$ and $\phi_2:N\rightarrow{\rm Res}_H^G\,M$. Set $L=\phi M$. Then $L$ is both a submodule and quotient module of ${\rm Res}_H^G\,M$ and a subquotient ${\rm Im}(\phi_1)/{\rm Im}(\phi_1)\cap{\rm ker}(\phi_2)$ of $N$ and $M\mid{\rm Ind}_H^G\,L$. 

My question is whether this is true for general locally compact groups. (Assume $G$ is unimdular and all irreducible unitary representations are admissible if this simplifies things.) The question can be generalized even further as follows: Suppose that $Z$ is just a normal amenable subgroup of $G$ and let $\mathrm{L}^2_\omega(G/Z)$ denote the set of $(Z,\omega)$-equivariant functions $\psi:G\to \mathbb{C}$ such that $|\psi|$ is square integrable when viewed as a function on $G/Z$. Is it true that any irreducible representation of $G$ that is weakly contained in $\mathrm{L}^2_\omega(G/Z)$ ($G$ acts by right translations) is weakly contained in $\mathrm{L}^2(G)$? 

$Z=1$ (since then $\pi$ above can be embedded in $\mathrm{L}^2(G)$), $G$ is a real or $p$-adic reductive Lie group. $G=Z$, or $G$ is compact, or more generally $G$ is amenable (since any irreducible representation is tempered in the previous sense). 

I am looking for a reference or an ad-hoc proof of the following fact, which seems to be known to experts: Let $\mathbf{G}$ be a complex algebraic group with maximal (algebraic) torus $\mathbf{T}$ and Weyl group $W$. Let $G=\mathbf{G}(\mathbb{C})$ and let $\mathrm{B}G$ denote the classifying space of $G$; define $T$ and $\mathrm{B}T$ similarly. Then the canonical map between the rational cohomology rings $\mathrm{H}^*(\mathrm{B}G,\mathbb{Q})\to\mathrm{H}^*(\mathrm{B}T,\mathbb{Q})$ is injective and its image is the $W$-fixed elements in $\mathrm{H}^*(\mathrm{B}T)$. There are numerous proofs of the analogous result for compact (real) Lie groups, i.e. when $G$ is a compact Lie group and $T$ is maximal compact torus in $G$. It should be possible to deduce the complex case from the real one because every complex reductive Lie group $G$ contains a maximal compact real Lie group $G_0$ which is a retract, but this fact alone is not sufficient as one has to take into consideration the corresponding maximal tori, and make sure that the corresponding Weyl groups of $G$ and $G_0$ relative to these tori are canonically isomorphic. 

(There are other equivalent definitions for temperedness when $G$ is a real or $p$-adic reductive Lie group.) It is not immediately obvious from the definitions that irreducible square-integrable representations are tempered, but it is known to be true in the following cases: 

Some hints in the literature led me to an answer, which I find a bit surprising: One can take $U'_\bullet=\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet)$ and the $1$-cocycle $\alpha\in Z^1(U_\bullet,A)\subseteq A(U_1)$ descends uniquely to a $1$-cocycle in $\alpha'\in Z^1(\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet),A)\subseteq A(U_0\times U_0)$ along $(d_0,d_1):U_1\to U_0\times U_0$. In other words: Proposition: For any hypercovering $U_\bullet$, the canonical map $Z^1(\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet),A)\to Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$ is an isomorphism. Consequently, the map $\mathrm{H}^1(\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet),A)\to \mathrm{H}^1(U_\bullet,A)$ is an isomorphism. This is a nontrivial statement so let me sketch the ad-hoc proof I have. Step 1: We may assume $U_\bullet=\mathrm{cosk}_1(U_\bullet)$. Indeed, since $U_\bullet$ is a hypercovering, the map $U_2\to \mathrm{cosk}_1(U_\bullet)_2$ is a covering, and this easily implies that $Z^1(\mathrm{cosk}_1(U_\bullet),A)\to Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$ is an isomorphism, so replace $U_\bullet$ with its $1$-coskeleton. One consequence of this assumption is that $U_2=\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{\mathrm{Simp}}(\partial \Delta^2, U_\bullet)$, where $\partial \Delta^2$ is the boundary of the $2$-simplex, realized as a constant simplicial object (i.e. sheaf) in $\mathbf{X}$, and $\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}$ denote internal $\mathrm{Hom}$ in $\mathbf{X}$. Step 2: Let $\alpha\in Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$. We claim that $a\in A(U_1)$ descends along $(d_0,d_1):U_1\to U_0\times U_0$ to some $\alpha'\in G(U_0\times U_0)$. Let $V=U_1\times_{U_0\times U_0}U_1$ and let $\pi_1,\pi_2:V\to U_1$ denote the first and second projections. Let $S$ denote the simplicial object of $\mathbf{X}$ obtained by gluing two copies of $\Delta^1$ along their vertices. Then $V=\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{\mathrm{Simp}}(S, U_\bullet)$. There is a simplicial map $\partial \Delta^2\to S$ which degenerate the edge $\{1,2\}$ into a vertex. This gives rise to a map $V\to U_2$, which in turn gives rise a map $A(U_2)\to A(V)$. Applying this map to the cocycle equation $d_0^2\alpha-d_1^2\alpha+d^2_2\alpha=0$ in $A(U_2)$ gives $0-\pi_2^*\alpha+\pi_1^*\alpha=0$ in $A(V)$, which means that $\alpha$ descends to $\alpha'\in G(U_0\times U_0)$. Step 3: We finally claim that $\alpha'$ lies in $Z^1(\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet),A)$, which proves the surjectivity of $Z^1(\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet),A)\to Z^1(U_\bullet,A)$. The injectivity follows easily from the fact that $(d_0,d_1):U_1\to\mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet)_1=U_0\times U_0$ is a covering. To show the claim, it is enough to show that the canonical map $U_2\to \mathrm{cosk}_0(U_\bullet)_2=U_0\times U_0\times U_0$ is a covering. Indeed, if this holds, then the fact that the $1$-cocycle equation holds for $\alpha$ in $A(U_2)$ implies that it holds for $\alpha'$ in $A(U_0\times U_0\times U_0)$. Proving that $U_2\to U_0\times U_0\times U_0$ is a covering amounts to showing that any $3$ "vertices" in $U_0$ can be joined by a "triangle" in $U_2$ locally. But this follows from $U_2=\underline{\mathrm{Hom}}_{\mathrm{Simp}}(\partial \Delta^2, U_\bullet)$ and the fact that $(d_0,d_1):U_1\to U_0\times U_0$ is a covering. I would value references for this proposition in the literature, if you know them.
