Are there any approaches that I should consider given I'd like to keep updates to a minimum, updates atomic, and retrieval queries as simple and "performant" as possible? My initial thought was to use an extra column, and only update and the values for a single row (with the retrieval query using ing by ), but that fails when you need to move a row in between two other rows that have the same value. No specific database in mind, as i use a broad spectrum myself. 

You can do this with a hierarchical recursive CTE. The only problem is that you have a loop in your data, due to there being , and , . 

I can't do hard s, it's just one of those things that breaks my brain. You need @bluefeet for that. Anyway, you can do it the oldskool way with and if the number of groups per is finite (I'm assuming the names are unknown, and there's a finite number: 

List all users who can SELECT on a particular table (either through being given a relevant role or through a direct grant (ie grant select on atable to joe))? The result of this query should also show through which role the user has this access or whether it was a direct grant. 

It is actually possible to check the IP address a user is logging in from using a login trigger, and deny the login if the IP address is "wrong", but that is a different question. 

You may nave to do the same for and if they exist in both tables (in this specific query). It's good practice to always fully qualify column names - can make the query easier to read. You can always use a table alias too to cut down on typing. 

You can do this with , but you'll need double the space occupied by the table. If I read your question correctly, this should do it: 

In the tree view on the left-hand-side, expand the tree for your database connection. Expand "Other Users", then "XYZ", then "Views". Double-click on the view name "ABC_CHAR" - this will open the column list. Click "SQL" above the column list to see the query that created the view. The other way to achieve this is to use SQL: 

Can you edit your post with the full error message you're receiving? Regarding your comment. I suspect you've got etc privs. These don't apply to sequences, as demonstrated below: 

There are several things in play here. A table that has a self-referential key is said to have a reflexive foreign key, though that doesn't look like it applies here because you'll have missing values. What you're looking for is a hierarchical query, which can be achieved in Oracle by using a clause. They can be a bit difficult to get your head around at first, but there are plenty of good examples on the internet. A good one to start with is here. For once, the official documentation is quite clear too! Something like: 

There's a useful page here that details any pros/cons/issues that you may encounter when setting the parameter. To answer your question, make sure you set when running any Oracle "internal" scripts. IE: patches, upgrades, anything in . 

Note that this would have been easier to fix with 3 control files, as you could have md5'ed each one to find out which was the bad apple. If the above doesn't work, you have further problems - if so, edit your question with the error message presented by SQL*Plus, and from the end of the alert log. I cannot reinforce how important it is that you backup the two control files somewhere safe before trying the above! It's entirely possible that there's another problem with a data file or redo log file, but we'll try this first. 

You can do this with auditing, but it incurs a performance overhead and does not work retrospectively. Read the section Verifying Security Access with Auditing in the OracleÂ® Database Security Guide 11g Release 2 (11.2). I'll add that in the majority of cases, somebody in the organisation thinks that this type of auditing is required, but more often than not it is just a misguided requirement. 

is the syntax - you weren't far off. As far as good/bad practice is concerned, that's opinion-based, so not really something that should be asked here. The alternative is to use the syntax after table creation. 

The other way to do this is to just move your entire Postgres data directory to the external drive, then symbolic link the external drive directory back to the original location. If you want to create multiple tablespaces over many drives you can also specify which tablespace a table or index should reside in using the TABLESPACE parameter in the creation DDL. 

Seeing as you have stated that the original data files look like they're untouched, all you need to do is recreate the service with , making sure you're using the 9i ORACLE_HOME service and tools. 

If you only need to run SQLPlus, grab "Instant Client Package - Basic" and "Instant Client Package - SQL Plus: Additional libraries and executable for running SQL Plus with Instant Client" from $URL$ & install them. oci.dll is a windows file, so I have no idea what could be achieved by installing that on Linux. unzip the files into a location of your choice & set LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH to point to that directory. If you need any further help after that, edit your question. 

The grant isn't needed if you create the directory logged in as the streams admin user (usually strmadmin). 

They're not all using the same port. The main mysqld process will have ed its children off (you can see the child<>parent relationship in the 2nd and 3rd columns of the output - pid 26308 looks to be the master "thread". Only one of the processes will actually be listening on the TCP port. You can verify this using . I'll add that a ed process will inherit the commandline from its parent, unless has been explicitly altered before the call, hence the confusion with - it means nothing. 

... at the mysql prompt. The session will still be open after the file is executed, unless the file has a command in it that causes the mysql shell to exit. 

The maximum sqlite can store as a signed is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (9 and a bit Quintillion), which is "greater than 10 digits". SQLite Datatype Documentation. The SQLite FAQ also covers an import aspect of dealing with data in SQLite - the fact it uses Dynamic Typing. 

Oracle Clusterware is the clustering software that is a component of an Oracle RAC setup. Rather than being seen as a separate software product, Clusterware is part of the software stack (which includes the OS, ASM, Oracle RDBMS) that makes up an Oracle RAC cluster/deployment. Oracle support other clustering products in a RAC environment on some operating systems.
