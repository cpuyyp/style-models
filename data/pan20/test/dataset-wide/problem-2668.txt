in the above 1, My consciousness is attending to an object out there in the world -- that's the object of my focus. In 2 and 3, the object of my focus moves to myself and to what my mind is doing. 

It would depend on our reasons for valuing specific species. To give an example of where it might be permissible, consider Peter Singer's view that what we want to do is minimize pain and suffering and that animal pain and suffering are not that different from our own (i.e., they count). If that's the reason we should kill, then it seems we would just need to calculate the net suffering produced by keeping invasive species A around. Again, for some reason to value animals, it won't matter. If for instance, the invasive species are humans and the existing species are dolphins and you think both are rational, then it's unacceptable to wipe one out to help the other. 

Background In recent scholarship, there's been a lot going on about what was called "Divine command theory" (DCT). Some of it interacts with an earlier literature about voluntarism with relation to God's will. Recently, Robert Adams has been a major advocate of DCT whereas Mark Murphy supports a distinct view called "divine will theory." In DWT, it's God's will that determines the content of morality whereas in DCT it's God's commands that determine its contents. In general DCT has been advocated by some Christian thinkers. C. Stephen Evans has applied Adams' account to Kierkegaard's thought. Adams is a Christian, as is Murphy. In all three, it is not necessarily the case that the commands be written in a book. And for DWT, it's not even required that it be translated to us clearly (or perhaps at all? This of course raises its own problems). But DCT (as distinguished from DWT) accepts the language transmission problems and makes God a type of communicator with people (Adams specifically cites Wolterstorff's Divine Discourses as reaching similar conclusions and looks at William "Bill" Alston's book on experiencing God). Answer All of this is just background to answer your question, I'd say there are three ways of "believing in DCT" that could involve not believing a holy book: 

But this breaks down, because Socrates seeks out to prove the oracle wrong by proving others smart. Socrates interrogates all of the people who claim to be wise and discovers they don't have any idea what they are talking about. Ergo, Socrates is forced to conclude he is the wisest because he has the advantage over them of knowing that he does not know anything (whereas they claim to know things). 

Now back to your quote, The use of "choice" rather than "will" has been become common, perhaps because it has less baggage, or perhaps because the Kantian picture is amenable to our thinking and works with the idea of choice between maxims more than thinking of the will as some faculty with independent standing (here I'm thinking of Christine Korsgaard's work). it sounds like you use "will" where philosophers historically used "desire", "emotion", or possibly "maxim." 

This will greatly depend on the rules you have access to. I would suggest the following strategy derive two implications by making two arguments by assumption: Side 1: 

It seems like if you have utter confidence in your expertise to comment on this policy, that the only questions remaining are: (1) Are you correct in asserting your action in contravention of policy X poses no risk? [i.e., is your policy expertise sufficient to contravene existing policy?] (2) is lying something of relative negative moral value or absolutely wrong? (3) if it is not absolutely wrong, is its wrongness outweighed by the rightness of blood-giving? 

Here I * the second part of your claim because Descartes only holds this view for a moment. In the end though, this is not a contradiction. The form of Descartes' argument is asymmetric, it would mean that person D can prove D exists (qua thinking thing) and (at that point) does not yet have a proof for the existence of others (other than D). The same thing is true of such trivial things as vision -- what I see is not the same as what you see even if we could both be looking at the same object. If, for instance, in my office I see a copy of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit but in your office you don't. There's no contradiction -- there's just a difference of perspective. Descartes proof (restricting ourselves to Meditation 2) is that for any given self, that self can know it exists and does not yet know if other selves exist in the same way. That this can be true of every self is no different than the idea that any self in my office can see my copy of Kierkegaard's Sickness unto Death but no self outside of my office can see it. 

First, regarding the thinkers you categorize as existentialists, the term "existentialist" is mostly a term coined by Sartre and applied retroactively to Kierkegaard. Second, you state: 

The practice of communication between humans is predicated on the truthful exchange of information in our communication. Stated positively, this means that acts of communication ought to fulfill this arrangement and convey truth. Conversely, stated negatively, if we did not think people were in general truthful, then we would not bother communicating with them -- or at a minimum communication would serve a vey different purpose. 

A Question of Consent: Is it moral to use human tissue in another without their consent? Also, do we need the consent of the parents of the embryo to use their tissue for this? What sort of disclosures are necessary and to what extent do they take place? GMO: Recent studies have shown the cells of babies in their mother's bodies -- specifically there are studies that show these cells healing damaged tissue in areas like the heart. Can we insure that embryonic stem cells do not mingle with the cells of the host in unexpected ways? (this is an analogue of an argument against GMOs). Why should we glibly allow this when not allowing GMOs? Cadaver argument: Would it be permissible to harvest cells from cadavers and use them in treating medical conditions in humans? Do embryonic stem cell lines count as "alive" to a sufficient extent to not be taboo? (i.e., are we avoiding the taboo by lying to patients about what we are doing?) Potential Immorality: even if we're fine with benefiting from the fruit of the labor of "nazi research," it's not the same thing as directly participating in it. As long as the person question is open, it is morally unacceptable to do this. Here, this is an epistemic variant on the argument about personhood -- as long as we are debating it, it is immoral regardless of what the eventual resolution might be. (E.g., imagine eating a steak with a friend who tells you that he had two steaks in the freezer -- one beef and one human, and he's not sure which one he cooked. Would you put down the knife?)
