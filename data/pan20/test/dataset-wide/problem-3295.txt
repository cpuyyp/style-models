There are two main senses in which people speak of conjugations (as countable things). One is (seemingly) arbitrary lexical classes such as -er, -ar, -ir verbs in Spanish. The other is classes of formal distinctions made, such as past, present, future, perfective, negative, focus etc. Such as there is a generally accepted theory, it would be that languages tend to eliminate things that have to be memorized, where there is no discernible rule. (The tendency can easily be resisted, as in the conjugation of "be" and "go"). Languages also tend to develop "constructions" where the meaning of two words put together isn't literally the sum of the parts, for example "have bought" isn't just the meaning of "have" plus the meaning of "bought", so you have to also learn a new rule for interpreting the construction. When this is coupled with some kind of phonological reduction of one of the parts, you get "grammaticalization" and the creation of a new conjugational parameter. These two trends, which are also common in languages, encourage an increase in the number of conjugations, and IMO reflect something about the nature of word-formation versus sentence-formation (that more arbitrary facts of combination and interpretation should be registered in the morphology, not the syntax). I am not aware of any in-depth empirical study across human languages that counts the likely historical increase in distinctions (for example in Bantu verbs) vs. decrease (as in most Indo-European languages or Arabic). 

It's not at all clear what the term "language isolate" means: one could think it means that the language is not related to any other known language. People mistakenly say "not related" when they mean "I can't show that it is related", in other words people sometimes confuse lack of evidence and knowledge of non-relationship. As long as you understand "language isolate" to mean "insufficient evidence to justify a claim of relatedness", then it's obviously the only valid null hypothesis, until one gains evidence to support a claim of relationship. 

Answers to your questions have to be prefaced with disclaimers about how one determines that something has a mora, or not -- phonology has embraced and eschewed the concept, and used it for all sorts of things. With that caveat, it has become a matter of virtual principle that every syllable nucleus has a mora (though Piggott 1995 "Epenthesis and syllable weight" allows for amoraic syllables), so yes. In Swahili, there is a contrast between syllabic and non-syllabic preconsonantal nasal, hence [m̩buni] "coffee plant" vs [mbuni] "ostrich". The noun prefix for cl. 9, found in "ostrich", also occurs in "dog", but it is syllabic and stressable ([ˈm̩bwa]). The reason for this exceptional moraicity of the nasal is a minimality condition requiring words to have two moras. To the extent that a language has diagnostics for moraicity, any phonologically syllabic consonant will pas the test of being moraic. However, also note that "syllabicity" is not a self-evident property that can be read trivially off the speech stream. An example of a consonant being both onset and nucleus, specifically, [mm̩], is discussed for Hehe in Odden & Odden "Kihehe Syllable Structure", where that language phonetically contrasts "moraic" nasals and "syllabic" nasals. In this case, both moraic [m̩] and "syllabic" [mm̩] count as a single mora. Classical Sanskrit is an example of a language with a contrast between long and short syllabic /r/ (and /l/, though that is more about grammarian's theory), and Slovak also has long and short syllabic /r,l/. 

TL; DR The main division is between substance-based theories (as you listed) and substance-free theories. Examples of the latter are Foley's theory, and Radical Substance Free Phonology (and to a lesser extent, the Parallel Structures Model). The latter class of theories does not require that features satisfy some phonetic predefinition, where the former theories do. The SPE position is spelled out on p. 299: "We shall describe the articulatory of every feature... We shall speak of the acoustical and perceptual correlates only occasionally, not because we regard these aspects as either less interesting or less important, but rather because such discussion would make this section, which is itself a digression from the main theme of our book, much too long". Since SPE is not considered to be a major break with the Jakobson and Halle approach, it would be somewhat redundant to repeat those acoustic characteristics -- but also illuminating, since diffuse, compact and grave do not translate directly into SPE theory. One failure of the wiki classification is that it omits perceptual and aerodynamic definitions of features. The feature [high] is a typical example of an articulatory feature, since it is defined in terms of a specific articulatory movement. [soronant] on the other hand is more of an aerodynamic feature, defined in terms of an aerodynamic result (spontaneous voicing) that must result -- there are many articulatory paths to that result. Heightened subglottal pressure is another. Distributed is also a hybrid articulatory-aerodymanic feature, describing the shape of the resonator but not what you articulate to achieve that end. Then, of course, strident is a strictly acoustic feature. For observational adequacy, SPE theory requires a set of features with definitions, plus multiple kinds of coefficients (u, m, +, - and integers). Because SPE is committed to feature matrices being phonetic descriptions of segments, and because for example high and mid vowels across languages are only roughly comparable, they require an auxiliary mechanism for describing the pronunciation difference between [i] in German vs. English. Integer coefficients are necessary in order to satisfy their desideratum of phoneticism. (They reject the notion of "phonetic implementation" and only allow truly automatic properties into a "phonetics"). However, the SPE theory of phonetic implementation via integer-manipulation turned out to be an uncashable check, and the result was that actual phonetic facts were ignored -- or, for some people, would lead to massive upsets in the analysis. The best-known example of that is the question of [voice] in English, owing to the fact that voiced obstruents are not consistently produced with focal fold vibration, as ideally required by the theory. Therefore b and p would be distinguished on the basis of aspiration, for some people -- but that precludes there being a difference between aspirated and unaspirated p, which exists at least on the surface in English. And since b can be actually is produced with vocal fold vibrations in some instances, this leads to the quandry that an instance of b might be [+voice] or [-spread], depending on how it actually ended up being produced. The main price that has to be paid comes from the premise that features are phonetic descriptions, not phonological ones. Given that premise, a theory which strictly limits definitions to one kind of phonetic fact is more restrictive than one that allows features to have multiple (potentially inconsistent) definitions. A mixed theory is better able to handle conflicts such as the mixed behavior of l as [+continuant] vs. [-continuant]; the consequence of that flexibility is that a smaller set of features is required (whereas in a strict-definition theory, more features would be required, in order to achieve the observed range of phonological class behaviors). Given the background assumption (the requirement to phonetically define features), there is no net price associated with mixed modes of definition, but it does require that you have a language-specific phonetic implementation component. 

There is no non-pathological possibility of a person not having a native language, so such a rhetorical statement amounts to saying that it's hard to decide which of many languages is one's "best" language. However, there are instances of people who have no language, at some point (when they would have normally acquired a language), for instance Genie. The concept "native language" is a convenient but inaccurate and unscientific term (often used by scientists, tsk tsk) for identifying a kind of language knowledge – similar terms are "first language", "dominant language" and "mother tongue". The factors that are most relevant in identifying a speaker are degree of fluency, order of acquisition, and mode of acquisition. All of these terms identify people who are completely fluent (though not necessarily omniscient or eloquent) in a language. "First" language can be misleading if a person first acquires Japanese but then moves to an English-speaking environment at age 4 – they may well not know a word of Japanese as an adult, but technically their first language is Japanese. "Mother tongue" suffers the disadvantage that it often means the language of your mother, as opposed to the language of their father, and I've had people tell me that they don't speak their mother tongue (meaning, the language of their mother). And the problems with "dominant language" is that it assumes that only one language can be "dominant", and there's no evidence for the claim "there can only be one", plus in many cases, people who are not fluent speakers of English still have English as their now-dominant language. (I know folks who haven't used their first language for 50 years, but still have an accent). In other words, since "native language" doesn't have an objective definition, there's no way to determine how many "native languages" a person has. 

The term was popularized by Aronoff in Word Formation in Generative Grammar, where (p. 10) he characterizes such morphemes as only occurring in one English word. This isn't a technical term requiring definition, so you can't be sure whether "only one word" is a defining property or an incidental one. (His discussion is a bit incomplete since one of the putative morphemes, Boysen in boysenberry, is the name of the inventor of the berry so that isn't really a hapax). However, that doesn't give cran- an independent meaning, it simply elevates the morpheme from hapax to "limited distribution", making it more like -mit. Since the coining of those terms, that would make huckle the only cranberry morpheme. Historically, there has been no inclination in linguistics to identify choco as a cranberry morpheme, despite appearing as a substring of chocolate. Notice however that one can form (and encounter in speech) words like chocoholic. This does not indicate that choco- and -holic are morphemes, rather it points to a prosodically-based word-formation process where (as a rough approximation) one foot from one word can be compounded with a foot from another word. That is what is behind cran-tini and the like. 

"Secondary articulation" refers to vowel-like properties that are superimposed on consonants with various "primary" articulations. So "alveolar" or "bilabial" are examples of primary (consonantal) articulations, and "rounding", "palatalization", "pharyngealization" are secondary articulations. The best-known example of secondary articulation is palatalization in Slavic, where most consonants have plain versus palatalized versions. In a number of languages, secondary articulations arise from assimilation to a neighboring vowel, for example in Russian, consonants are palatalized before front vowel suffixes such as the suffix for locative (prepositional) -e or abstract nouns -izm; or, in Nupe, consonants are rounded before round vowels (also palatalized before front vowels). It is true that an assimilation is an effect of a preceding or following sound, which need not be immediately preceding or following. But almost all phonological processes involve a preceding or following segment, and many are not assimilations (for instance, dissimilation, not to mention ornery arbitrary changes such as in Chukchi, tʃ becomes s before q). Unless a rule is context-free (for example, g -> ŋ everywhere), any rule involves a preceding or following segment, so there isn’t anything special about assimilations or secondary articulations in that respect. Given a two-way division of phonological properties into "quantity" and "quality" (basically, everything except length), assimilation does involve quality, insofar as quantity is a structural property that doesn't assimilate. It is correct that secondary articulation is about a specific type of place of articulation. However, secondary articulation and assimilation are incommensurable (one is not a case of the other). Assimilation refers to the process of one sound becoming more similar to another in any sense, and secondary articulation is a very specific fact about the articulation of consonants (whether via a rule, or simply lexically). Accordingly, Russian [bratʲ] 'to take' has a consonant with a secondary articulation ([tʲ]], and there is no assimilation (the consonant is underlyingly palatalized, and contrasts with [t]: [brat] 'brother'). The term 'coarticulation' is ambiguous between the specialized sense applied to [kp, gb] as in Igbo and other languages with labio-velar stop, where the term has been used at times to make it clear that the consonant in question is a single segment with two simultaneous articulations (not a cluster), and the more common contemporary usage deriving from phonetic theory, where the articulatory state of one segment perseveres or is anticipated, and overlaps that of another neighboring segment. An example of that is how the lips round in anticipation of a following rounded segment in English 'cool', 'school'. The process is continuous over time, as one can see looking at a spectrogram of 'school' and noting the downward-sloping line arising from increased labial constriction. Coarticulation is similar to assimilation, except that assimilation is a categorial phonological change from one sound to another along a featural dimension, whereas coarticulation is a continuous change, and it is specifically in terms of articulators whereas features are only loosely related to particular articulators. It is hypothesized that coarticulation relates to assimilation, in that coarticulation is a natural phonetic phenomenon, and is often phonologized into assimilatory rules. Many assimilations are due to acoustic overlap, which, if phonologized, can cash out as a change in articulator state. It would not be correct to maintain that coarticulation is physically mandated (this is essentially the SPE position). So-called vowel nasalization in English is clearly coarticulatory, as Cohn 1990 clasically shows, and it is specific to English (French has a different pattern). There are universally-mandated kinds of coarticulation, for example, in Turkish, there is lip protrusion during the production of consonants like /p,t,k/ when preceded and followed by the vowel [u] -- the lips do not suddenly un-round during the production of the /l/ in [pulun]. It is an open research question which instances of coarticulation are due to physical necessity, and which are part of the phonetics of the given language.
