I would say it depends on the field. No harm done in warning a candidate or asking if he does not mind being interviewed in English. However, it might also depends on the field. On Information Technology is pretty much expect you are proficient in English at least in an intermediate Level, and whilst nobody expects you to conduct long talks, people expect a minimum of proficiency. Whist in some interviews I was warned beforehand it would be in English, in many countless others, I was just asked at the last minute if I would not mind switching languages. I would also add to the discussion from personal experience, that how the candidate deals with that request at the last minute varies with maturity and command of the tongue. Nevertheless, I also nowadays prefer a previous warning of several sorts of interviews, as not to waste time with processes that would not be a fit for me. 

Instead of inconveniencing people, buy all the stuff online and ask for delivery at your place. You will arrange for it to be delivered around early morning time, so you can manage a backup plan on the possibility of something going wrong. The small extra added cost is well worth having a store doing the delivery. Eventually if the firm is big enough, a local family store may be even more than happy than receiving an automated email asking for such stuff. PS. I used such services in 2016 xmas, around a time of a surgery, and bought in a big super market chain pretty much all the food, cakes, drinks for xmas, 200 Euros of goods that were delivered at my door at an arranged day and hour. The extra cost of delivery was between 4 and 6 Euros, depending on the time of day. 

The employer has a mechanism that prevents competitors from poaching employees, it is called paying a good salary. Your cannot and should not be coerced into sign something that will prevent you from working on your field of choice, much less as a low level employee. As a low level employee, I would strike down and not accept a non-compete clause from any contract presented to me. Furthermore, the law already has by default provision on places that will punish me from accepting work from direct competitors while I work for them. 

The answer also pretty much depends on the situation, the context, the culture and the people involved. As an example for further contextualisation, once I had an "interview" with an Italian lady who asked me my salary point blank, and when I was not happy it, she indulged me into explaining it was to see "if I was fit for the position". I told her the interview was over at that point. Another time, in my 2nd shortest interview, I was being interview by a firm which had pending legal problems, and I told them I did not feel comfortable with the situation. They thanked me for my honesty, and wished me good luck. Some other time my judgment failed me, and I told a good friend who got me an interview that her interview RH person was an idiot, and I would not consider working in a place employing someone like that. The friendship suffered with it. All the other situations I had, including an outrageous interview with an out of touch IT manager from Gibraltar, or with people lowballing the salary from the get go, I either had the luck of them not coming back, or give one of the above excuses when they insisted on following up with the interview process; it is quicker that way. The one time I insisted with someone interviewing me for an expat position that they were lowballing me, they tried to reason with me for forty minutes - it is not worth the effort. Life is too short to work with people whom you do not feel comfortable with. If an organisation lets someone more shady be the face to the outside world, it could be a good hint their culture is not the best match for you. 

Some retail employers will limit the hours of teens to 30 or less. My son (19yo and just finished his freshman year in college) is scheduled on average 30 hours a week or less (during the summer). Anything more than that for a regular schedule he would be considered full-time and they would have to offer benefits. He does keep the job year-around by working one weekend a month during the school year and lots of hours (which do not qualify as full-time as it's temporary/seasonal) from November-January. We're thrilled he's got this job as he doesn't have to find a summer job (which get's him out of the house and away from the video games). Good luck! 

As you get further along in your career the technology you use to solve business problems (which is what we are paid to do) is less and less important. Technologies can (and do change) and it's up to us (as professionals) to learn and use different things. In my case I started in COBOL. Moved to VB6 and then .NET in it's various incarnations (from winforms to aspx to MVC). Last year I picked up a project in java/grails (when I had zero experience with these) when the original developer left. I was able to do this because I can think in both business terms and with technology. After only one year you don't yet have the experience to make a change. Where I'm at now we don't even interview when the candidate has less than 4 years of experience. 

You are the project manager. If your only way to keep your project on schedule is to play the childish game of confiscating something like car keys then you've got bigger problems than someone going through your desk to retrieve their own property. If I was asked this by a project manager my response would be "f**k no". I'd then be talking to my supervisor (and maybe HR). Treat the people on your project (developers, analysts, testers, etc.) as professionals. Treating them a children is guaranteed to get the pushback your getting. If the project is missing deadlines then you (as the PM) need to lead. Do you have a daily standup? Scrum? Goals for each day, week, month specified? Do you get developer feedback (if using a methodology such as agile) for specific deliverables? Are the people on your team involved in setting goals? Holding people accountable is the goal. Treating them like children is not. 

I came from a COBOL background. Started on this fancy desktop stuff with VB6. Now I do C# full-stack Microsoft stuff. So I understand his pain. Throwing an experienced procedural programmer straight into the OO world and expecting them to understand the OO world is almost guaranteed to fail. The reverse would also apply if (for whatever reason) you were now on a COBOL project. The learning curve would be huge. So, as someone that went through this please start slow. Divide the project up into small modules. If there is something COBOL-like such as as file import/export or reporting these would be a great place to start. Additionally, pair programming where you each take turns writing the code while the other provides feedback would give immediate feedback on programming. Who knows, you might also learn something. 

I work as a programmer on a team that supports a group of enterprise applications. The team is so short-staffed and back logged that we currently suffer from an issue where we don't have time to create an error tracking / alerting system. All of our time is spent on supporting/fixing existing functionality, or building new functionality. We all work at the minimum 40 hour weeks, and we are all exempt / salaried. As a team we have discussed the dire need to get such a program in place because it will significantly reduce the time spent on break/fix and maintenance. I would like to offer my manager additional time to create a solution for the team, but I feel like it would only benefit myself if I were to receive a bonus for this additional time spent. The company regularly hires contractors to complete work that they are understaffed themselves to complete, so I feel like it isn't odd for them to shell out more to get what is needed. Is it ethical to propose to my boss that I offer a project plan to create this new program in exchange for a pay bonus? Or would that be seen as a slap in the face and unprofessional? This is not a request for a raise as I feel I am compensated for the average work week. I am requesting a one-time bonus for a one-time time-set project which would be solely worked on outside of usual duties. 

In email correspondence I was asked a few questions that I am to answer before my interview. One of those questions was: "What are your salary requirements?" How can I approach this question when I haven't even been interviewed yet? I know what similar jobs pay in the area... but I don't even know all of the position responsibilities yet ...24hr on-call, weekends, time off, travel, ect. I don't want to just say an amount and have them hold that over me if I think it is too little for the work I want... but I also don't want to go too high and cut my chances of even getting interviewed. What is the best way to respond this? 

I have been working as a programming intern for a little over 6 months with a company. The hiring company sends me out to work for another company which in turn pays them. The "manager" at my office signs off on my timesheets and then I email or fax them in to a secretary at my hiring company to get paid. (1 timesheet ever 2 weeks) I did not sign any contract with my employer about the exact pay periods, at least to my knowledge. 

The above answers are very good. However let's look at this a different way. You are an expense. You're looking at this from what the company can do for you (ie. the salary). Instead, show what you can do for them to make the company more profitable. Talk in business terms of how you will add to the bottom line which will justify the larger salary. 

For each item there is a Pass/Fail/NA checkbox with a space for comments for that item. Then there is an overall pass, pass with exceptions or reject section with a comment area. For us, as a regulated industry, a proper code review is required before moving any code - web, sql script, etc. - into a production environment. This is part of the release documentation. When we are audited if this is not part of the release package there can be fines and/or people losing their jobs. Good luck on this. Code reviews are something that some developers don't like and some managers don't emphasize. After they have a problem with code that was not adequately reviewed they will get the point. 

Some companies/industries require a current resume as part of an employees paperwork. For the industry I'm in this is part of the regulatory paperwork for such things as audits (in our case FDA). It needs to be kept updated every 6 to 12 months. I got my bachelors in '79 and masters in '83 but I still have to keep updated. 

Not strange. I work for a company that has as part of a regulatory requirement that our CV is updated on a yearly basis. This comes from FDA audits where the background of those doing the work must be part of a presentation. As an aside - for a previous employer I kept my resume updated on a quarterly basis. This helped me to document what I did for a quarter and could be used for my annual (ugh) self-assessment. 

In a previous life I wrote/supported a program that was used to calculate salaries and bonuses for employees. For this I needed to get a feed from HR during salary review season. The file was supposed to have masked/encrypted fields that were unpacked in my program and only viewable by a set of users and their access level. One year, the program blew up when importing. It turns out the HR clerk that pulled the data that year didn't use the program written (that encrypted the data) but instead ran a Peoplesoft SQR which put the data into plain readable ASCII text. When I opened the file to investigate I could see everyone's current salary. I immediately notified my supervisor. INFOSEC and HR were notified. My manager notified senior management. Then the CD the data was written to was placed in a secure disposal system by my manager. This had some major ramifications but as we (me and my boss) covered our buts it was others (the HR person) were the ones disciplined. You can't be too safe here. Notify your boss.
