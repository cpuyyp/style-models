At the risk of suggesting the obvious here: 1) Rig up an internal hoop. Use a spare of one of the external hoops and cut a few inches off to fit. Pad the ends, and Velcro the ends and top to the inside of the tent. 2) Put a few more guy-ropes on the end hoops to encourage some more lateral tension. Second option should be the easiest one to try. 

Because roads are harder than hooves, and whatever is harder usually wears down whatever is softer. It's also pretty good protection against chipping/splitting that the horse may get from stepping on rocks. 

Condensation is usually caused by high humidity combined with a temperature differential. It sounds like you have a very humid atmosphere, which in a tent is added to by the high moisture content of your breath, and if you are warm at night, also sweat. It doesn't need to be that cold, especially not if the humidity is really high, but a temperature drop at night could cause a fair amount of condensation. 

If we exclude the birdwatching explanation Shem gives, the only possible ecological reason for a bird feeder is to counteract the negative effect we have on the bird's habitat by having our house there. This doesn't explain why we only tend to feed "cute" animals - if we are to be honest about ecological support, we should analyse impact data on all the species we have negatively impacted in our locale and feed them all no matter if they are cute birds, hedgehogs etc or spiders, insects and slugs... And very few people will do that, sadly! In reality, all life impacts other life. Human occupation has negative impact on some species and positive on others. We cannot really justify bird feeding from an ecological standpoint. Personally, I have nesting boxes for finches and tits in the big trees at the bottom of my garden, bee-friendly plants and insect "hotels" in my garden, but I also have a cat that actively hunts, I dissuade the foxes and deer from coming too close and I dispose of snails and slugs - so even though I am ecologically aware, I'm as biased towards animals I like as the next person. 

It would be unusual for a snake to attack a stationary person. I suppose it's possible that a snake might approach you or your shelter to try to get warm, and you could then surprise them after they had already settled down near you. I'm guessing there is no coyote season in Nevada, so you could be doing it any time of year. If it's the winter, snakes are likely to be hibernating. I suppose in the early spring, when snakes are coming out of hibernation and actively searching for food, might be the most likely time to encounter a snake if you are stationary. I've spent plenty of time out in the Mojave desert, and the vast majority of the snakes I've seen have not been venomous. I've never had a snake do anything other than 1) nothing or 2) try to get away from me, usually by moving just far enough away that it felt safe. I agree that scorpions might be a bigger concern. Desert recluses and black widows are obviously dangerous, but unlikely to move to you after you're already set up and stationary - you're more likely to encounter them when you are setting up or taking down your blind, assuming you're setting up on or next to a rock pile. 

For years I used to wear Oakley Razor Blades when surfing (yes, I am that old...) but once I started to manage slightly bigger waves, even wearing a strap to hold them on wasn't enough. In reality, unless you are on small surf, you will have them ripped off when you wipe out, so your best bet is to learn to surf without them. You will very quickly avoid spray and sand in them. Not sure what to do about the sun, though. Typically at noon it is at its highest, so it shouldn't be an issue. I have only ever had problems with morning or evening surfing where you end up facing the sun when it is low on the horizon. 

A couple of factors from my own experience are: Pronation - I over-pronate slightly, so the outside of my heel gets worn down more quickly than the inside. When it wears past a certain point, I find myself rolling my ankle more than usual and end up buying new boots. Sole material - The softness of the sole material has a large impact on the longevity. Soft "comfort" soles of course wear out a lot faster than harder soles. This of course is why running shoes wear out quickly. Of course, the downside is that harder soles can be a little less comfortable, but that's something you'll need to weigh up for yourself. I'd agree that 300 miles (30 decent walks) are on the low end of what you'd expect. I'd advise you to take a good look over your worn-out boots and identify where they've worn out the most, then buy something that addresses those points. Or take an old pair into a reputable store and ask for guidance. 

A bowline is not recommended for tying a boat to a pole because it can work itself loose over time, or when bounced. Instead, the recommendations are an anchor bend or a double bowline - and as an anchor bend can become impossibly tight over time, a double bowline might suit you best: 

Update on the sleeping side of things: I would use a relatively light sleeping bag, at most a two seasons one. It doesn't get that cold in Scotland, as the north Atlantic drift keeps our climate pretty mild all year. In terms of tents the key is to get one which can cope with winds as they can get pretty high. I wouldn't expect much over a force 4 for that week though, the forecasts seem reasonable. I have camped out west in everything from a cheap tent from Asda up to proper tents. Just take normal guy rope precautions, ensure there is a good groundsheet, and you aren't going to get water pouring in, and you should be fine. 

If your friend is undoubtedly dead, then your own safety becomes paramount. If you can't safely get to the body, then you can only leave it in situ until you get the authorities there (by whatever means). In the unlikely event the body is in the open and readily to hand, then practically speaking, protecting the dignity of your friend (and family) is most important. If you have no means of contacting the authorities from where you are and have to travel some distance to gain help/communication: 

This sounds like a macabre version of one of those teambuilding exercises. As noted above, your emotions will be going haywire and you won't think clearly. You'll probably stay with your fallen friend for some time before you get your thoughts in order. 

We car-camped with our 5 month old using a yoga mat as a sleeping pad wedged in above our heads in a two person backpacking tent. It was summer and in California, so we weren't worried about moisture from touching the sides. We were worried about having him sleeping in anything too soft, because that's against the recommendations for infants (suffocation, etc.). If you do this, make sure to have baby's feet facing your spouse, because whoever is on the foot end could get kicked in the head all night by a squirmy baby. This year I tried sleeping in a tent one night with the same kid, now 1+ year old, and I gave up because he wouldn't sleep, and just screamed for like 2 hours straight. Luckily this was a test run in our back yard, so we just went back inside to our regular beds. Cloth diapers would be more virtuous, but we didn't want to have to drive home with dirty diapers (we were camping on national forest land, not in a campground with wash facilities). We just tossed the dirties in the bear-proof trash at the trailhead in the morning. 

Always surface dive/snorkel first. I have cliff dived in two locations - one is normally deceptive: poor visibility, shadows etc but on visual checks turned out to have 100 ft straight down to a sandy floor; the other looked clear and deep but had rocky ledges at about 20 feet! Considering we dived from 80 - 100 feet, that second location was scary! Remember that while you may try to go 10-15 feet, as per ShemSeger's post, sometimes you will end up much deeper. 

Yes - 50lbs draw means you need to be able to pull 50lbs, unless you have a pulley/gear reduction. So if you increase to a higher draw, you'll need to be able to pull it.
