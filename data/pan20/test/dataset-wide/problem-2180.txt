If it is indeed alienating your peers, then it's probably going to negatively impact your work and productivity. And "don't broadcast it" isn't the same thing as hide it. I would suggest that what was meant was more "don't make a big deal about it, and don't abuse it" rather than "just make sure no one sees you leave". Just a guess of course, but given your description of the culture, it sounds like "don't broadcast it" probably means something like "don't say you are leaving at 2 on Friday on Monday". If this is indeed the culture that management wants, then they probably perceive it as being relaxed and casual -- on Fridays, you work until you get to a good stopping point and then take off, not that the work week is 36 hours. As for your actual question -- I suggest that you don't do things that make you uncomfortable. That isn't meant to say go along. You have to decide which is worse, going along or alienating your co-workers. Best solution is to somehow resolve the issue -- either you becoming comfortable with going along, or helping your co-workers become comfortable with you not going along. 

This man is your colleague, he is not your friend, and he is not your brother. While it is natural and often healthy for colleagues that work closely together to discuss non-work issues, you are never required to engage with him on that level. Since your colleague has taken advantage of your willingness to act as a friend, you need to stop being a friend. You should adopt an all-business persona when working with him. If he starts with a gloomy monologue, cut him off politely with "I'm sorry, but we really need to make progress with the X project." If he takes a break for his leering at a passerby, say, "If you aren't able to focus on our work here, perhaps we should move this meeting to a conference room." In short, minimize personal contact with him, while clearly communicating that you expect professionalism from him. 

Companies do not, in general, compare resumes, with your prior or future employers. Which means that when you apply for a new position, you are starting fresh. If you were applying for a job which required a security clearance, this might come up in the background check, but in the normal course of business, companies that you are applying with verify what you tell them, they don't independently research your job history. That said, the more you lie, the better your chances of getting caught and it getting around -- I wouldn't recommend making up any more fake job history. 

That will be determined by the contract between the staffing company and the hiring company. Note that rewarding the staffing company for providing excellent workers will encourage them to continue to provide excellent workers. If I'm a staffing company and two companies want the same type of job filled and I have two candidates, the better candidate is probably going to the company that rewards me more. 

My answer would be that this candidate did not only demonstrate arrogance, but also a lack of understanding of the difference between the things that he knows and the things that he does not know. Such a lack of understanding is crippling when trying to solve difficult technical problems. Since it appears that you role in the interview process was more on the technical side, you should focus on the technical failures. Evidently (and unfortunately) your input on the personal characteristics of the candidate are not being considered. 

It sounds like much of your unhappiness is with the client company. You could ask for a different assignment, but don't hold your breath. I've tried to obtain a different assignment while in your position, but your employer won't want to put you in a different position without being able to simultaneously back-filling your spot with your current client. Your situation is actually far better than when you took this job. Currently: 

First off, this is not really a grey area -- you are under no obligation to keep them informed about your employment status. It starts and ends with honesty, so don't worry about having done something wrong, unless you lied to them. Secondly, there isn't a hard and fast rule, that we can give and you can apply. Whether you should inform them or not really depends upon their reaction to being informed, which we have no good way of predicting. If you are on their short list and they are hesitating because they need someone sooner rather than later, telling them is probably going to be good. If they are considering you, but aren't in a rush, telling them could make you look irresponsible, not a good thing. You have to decide whether it will help or not, and if it will, how soon you should inform them -- I would suggest no sooner than a couple of days after you have made the decision to leave. 

You can ask, but it is a long-shot. If they have a standard performance bonus, you would have received it. If they do not have a system of giving bonuses, you can be sure they aren't going to start it for one employee. If they have met your salary requirements, your best bet for further negotiations is to ask for more PTO, particularly if your compensation package has less (or not more) vacation than your previous job. Ultimately, though, there is no non-aggressive way to say: "Thanks for offering the money that I asked for, and said that I would be satisfied with. I'm ready to take the job if you just offer more money." 

You left because they wouldn't make you Head of Development. So, they had to ask themselves would the other guy leave if they don't make him HoD, and they figured either the answer was yes, or they didn't want to risk the answer being yes. Plus at the moment it's a meaningless title -- why would they not give it to him? Conversation probably went something like this "Alice, Bob has just left, we need you to take over his duties as well as your own while we look for someone else. We'll give you a .02% raise (that's two cents for every $100) and the title Head of Development. When we hire his replacement, he'll either report to you or to me, we'll work that out later." 

My preferred way would be to tell my boss first, then privately tell those people that I work most closely with, allowing a chance to explain some of the reasons for my choice. After those that would be most effected by the decision already know (maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of the team) I would mention it in a daily stand-up meeting. I would speak positively about how I will help in the transition, and make sure to express gratitude for the opportunity to work with the current team. And be brief. The reason I prefer to leak the information slowly is to take away the emotional impact of a "big reveal." 

Your thinking in this regards is wrong. You should assume that a secretary is privy to all correspondences that her boss is part of. In fact you should assume that she sees more of his correspondences than he does. Discussing it is another matter, but if it was only with you and you received a copy of it, I'd not consider that inappropriate. 

Operating a company takes resources, and a company may have insuffiecient resources to expend everywhere they want to operate, particularly in countries that place a high burden on companies in respect to their employees. So, I wouldn't say it was cause for concern, but it is something that you should keep in mind when determining what your compensation should be. BTW -- LTD or self employed should make no difference to them. They want you, and they want you to be available when they need you. How you structure that isn't really their concern. I'm not sure what you mean by company protocol... 

Your best bet here is to negotiate with the company that made you the offer. Tell them that you really hate giving up seven days of vacation, and ask if they could increase your vacation time in your first year. This is a negotiation, and they have no obligation to do it, but you do actually have leverage with them, where you have none with your current company. If they decline, you could ask if it would be acceptable to push back your start date a few weeks or a month to give you a chance to take some of your days off before giving notice. But asking for the company to do other than their policy with unused vacation days is a non-starter, and makes you look either greedy or naive. Try to leave well. 

I suggest replying to the recruiters email, cc'ing the candidate, saying that you do not accept referals from recruiters, and that if the candidate is interested in the position, he will have to apply for it himself. This gets everything out in the open -- making it clear your company does not pay a finders fee, and that the recruiter contacted YOU about this candidate. It gives the candidate the facts about your interaction with the recruiter (who may be just sending out random spam in the hopes that some of it sticks), and lets him know there is an open position. And if the candidate applies, you may get a new employee, without having to sneak around.
