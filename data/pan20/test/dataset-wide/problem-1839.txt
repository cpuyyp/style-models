There is much more to be learned from being in office beyond simply how to fit in well with the team, etc, etc. The primary thing that I would be looking for from any internship, in any field, is the opportunity to observe people who are skilled and successful at their job at work. With specific reference to programming, in most cases this goes beyond a simple ability to write code or design frameworks - these things can be learned from books. They are typically much "softer" skills, like communication or teamwork. It includes things like the manner in which they interact with people around them, the way the choose to lead or follow, the way they give feedback to people, etc. These are the things that are most valuable to an intern, and none of them can be learned remotely. 

Don't pay for health care during that week. If you get injured, pay for it out of pocket. If the expense is catastrophic then you can sign up for COBRA retroactively up to sixty days after your last day and your coverage extends backwards in time to the day you left your job. It's expensive but it is cheaper than catastrophic care. Do not take my word for it; I am not an expert on COBRA. Today would be a great day to research COBRA and learn for yourself how the program works. You're fine. Go enjoy your vacation, and try to not break any limbs. 

That was the correct response. An even better response would have been "I look forward to receiving your offer letter; please email it to blah@blah.com and I'll give it my prompt attention. Have a nice day, goodbye." 

There's a huge amount of research into how office layouts affect employee happiness and productivity, with some areas that have a consensus view, and others that don't. Some of the things that have a consensus view are that poor lighting, uncomfortable furniture and high noise levels have highly detrimental impacts on productivity (see 1 and 2 below and this very good TED Talk). However, one of the things that has more varying conclusions is that of office layout - specifically open-plan vs private offices. The general principle seems to be thus: 

Openly, honestly, and in a culture that emphasises learning from mistakes instead of punishing failure. Without that, it's very very hard. 

The best way is simply to be open and honest about why you don't want to go - this makes it clear that you are not making up excuses to hide something else. Nobody worth knowing is going to think less of you for not wanting to spend money on food you don't like. As long as they don't feel that you're trying to avoid the team, then they've no reason to take offence. 

That's easy; as others have said, put your coworkers who are known to be fit through the process; if the process consistently rejects them, then there's something wrong with the process. But that's not the problem you have. This is a question-and-answer site, and you've asked the wrong question. The problem you actually have is a significant fraction of candidates are plainly unfit, and this is wasting time, effort and money that could be better spent elsewhere. You have a pipeline problem, not a coding question problem. Something in your candidate pipeline is producing a large fraction of plainly unfit candidates. As is well known, a great many programming job applicants have no ability whatsoever to write even simple programs: $URL$ Ask around and see if other interviewers are having similar problems. If they are, then push back on management and recruiting to see if they can figure out what is incentivizing recruiting to keep sending you unqualified candidates. 

The phrase you are looking for is forms of address, and there is a huge amount of information on the subject. The sheer amount of information points to the fact that the correct form varies from honorific to honorific, country to country and setting to setting. The best I can do is point you at some references: 

However, most of the studies that support open plan offices tend to have "softer" definitions and measures of productivity, while studies with firmer definitions and more scientific measurement practices tend to favour private offices. The biggest negative factor against open plan offices is almost always noise, and quieter open plan offices score better than loud ones. Headphones or ear plugs are also shown to help. As such, the prevailing, though not consensus view, seems to be that private offices are better (see 3 below). References: 

Give huge bonuses for cooperation that leads to good outcomes, and fire people who sabotage their coworkers. Huge bonuses. Like absolutely enormous. You know, like the bonuses that CEOs routinely grant themselves at the expense of the company. 

So don't burn bridges. Be polite and professional. People quit. That's business. If they don't get that, then that's their problem. 

The bit where you express unhappiness is "I'm disappointed to not have the opportunity to work with you this time", in case that was unclear. 

Signaling that you're willing to walk away from a deal is a powerful negotiating position, but you've got to be willing to do it, and you've got to convince them that they really are lucky to get you. You know what good hiring managers want to hear? Only two things. Hiring me will make you hugely more revenue than my fee, and hiring me will lower your costs more than my fee. Now, I'm not saying to in any way be misleading about your motives. But if you're asked again "why do you want to give up your lucrative freelance job to work for us?" then emphasize something that looks more like a win-win. "I want to concentrate on writing great code to solve (business problem X) without having to waste my valuable time that I could be coding drumming up clients, dealing with billing and all the other hassles of freelancing" is way better than "my code isn't maintainable, so I want to learn from your guys on the job". 

The best way to answer this question is to think about it slightly differently: how do you best sell the idea to your colleague that you being his boss is a good thing? The easiest way to do that is to give him the recognition that he feels your mutual boss denies him, and to promote him to your mutual boss in front of him (and others). This way, you become an asset to him, and not a barrier. As for the interruptions, well, that may be a bit trickier. Depending on your relationship, it may be possible to bring this up in a direct manner, but remember to sell it to him in terms of how it hurts him (which he ultimately cares about), not in terms of how it affects you (which he ultimately doesn't). It all comes back to Jerry Maguire:
