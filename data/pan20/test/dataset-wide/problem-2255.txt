Note that if there are bears, in addition to cougars, where you will be camping, bear canisters are a good idea. The anecdote in the answer of @bitsmack suggests that you'd be happier in a tent, as does this excerpt from The List: 

Much of my hiking has been done in the Sierra, especially Yosemite, where waterfalls and cascades of every size abound. I have always thought of a waterfall as water that flows over a lip and then falls freely. And a cascade as water that may flow quite steeply downhill but remains in contact with the underlying rock or streambed. I would never describe Nevada Falls, for example as a cascade, nor would I describe the cascades that flow over the bare granite at roughly the 8,000 foot level of Yosemite Creek as waterfalls. Is there a difference between the two in TGO in other parts of the world, or have I made up a distinction that is not commonly used in TGO? 

Breaking Strength The rule of thumb for rigging is that the breaking strength of the rope should be roughly 15x the static load. That's something in the 1300 kg breaking strength range. Probably overkill for a hammock over a soft surface, but if you plan on pitching over rocks or in more precarious locations is worth investigating. Also, the tighter you rig your hammock the more the load on the endpoints is magnified. Stretch The standard nylon cords available stretch signficantly under load and even more when they get wet. Even "static" cords like paracord can stretch. For a hammock, even a little stretch can be a problem. 

I have the Gerrig system and for me the primary advantage is the ability to spray water. In really hot weather sometimes the most effective use of water is to spray it on you, rather than drink it. This is easy to do with a standard cycling water bottle and next to impossible with most hydration packs. Doing 8 hr MTB races, I have problems with muscle cramping late in the event. Spraying water on my legs helps a lot. With the Gerrig system I don't need to carry both a water bottle and a hydration pack. It's also quite useful in muddy conditions to alleviate the gunk in the drive train. While the pressurization is a nice benefit for actually drinking water, I don't think it's enough of a benefit on it's own to balance the trade off in extra weight and complexity. Having said that the system I have works really well and outside of the extra weight has no other drawbacks in over 3 years of use. 

I agree with what Charlie Brumbaugh said and will not repeat it, but will offer an perspective on what the individual can do. The single most effective thing you can do to improve your acclimatization rate is to get in good aerobic shape before starting your trip. Ability to acclimatize varies enormously among individuals, and, for an individual, ability to acclimatize can depend on the altitude. Some people are fine at modest elevations (say, 14,000 feet and lower) and then just top out. Ability to acclimatize will eventually lessen with age, but at what age the decline becomes noticeable will again vary enormously with the individual. And, again, staying aerobically fit will postpone that decline. Moreover, if you take several yearly trips, you may find your ease of acclimatization actually increases with the years (for awhile.) As for weather, naturally you will be able to move more briskly if it is not too hot, but this would be true at sea level. As long as you are pushing yourself but not exhausting yourself -- and staying hydrated -- you will acclimatize. Statistics won't tell you anything about yourself at altitude or anywhere else. 

6 of one, half dozen of another. A lot comes down to how easy it is to hike in the ski boots you are using. The problem with hiking is that it only takes a short stretch of unpacked trail to lose any gain in time and you can't take advantage of any brief downhill stretches. Even with skins you can get a bit of glide. On the other hand, if the trail has been boot packed, skinning can be difficult and in hard crusty conditions, boots and crampons are generally faster. I'm not sure I buy the 1lb on the feet vs 6 on the back argument. If you're moving your skis up and down that much, you need to work on your skinning technique. Also half the time, half the weight of skis is just resting on the ground vs you having to support it. 

This is only a partial answer, and I don't feel comfortable citing the following source without permission. I e-mailed a highly condensed version of my question to a reputable guiding company specializing in small group trips and custom charters in Southeast Alaska. This is the reply: 

So far, clear. But take a look at the name for the young of cougars. The young of mountain lions are often called kittens. This seems an odd choice for the young of such a large cat. Wikipedia says: 

This sounds thrilling, but a coasteering experience that would be fine for a child soon after it has learned to walk, or a person in their seventies, however athletic and proficient, probably doesn't offer much of a challenge to an experienced coasteerer (if this is a word) in her prime. And vice versa: a route that would challenge an experienced coasteerer is probably no place for a beginner. I have searched Are there grades in coasteering, and the few hits I got were about training coasteering guides, such as this one. Hence my question: Is there a grading system, even an embryonic grading system, for this sport, similar (but perhaps more complicated) to the grading system for climbing? Or not, for reasons of the newness of the sport or the nature of the sport? Or would someone thinking about trying a route have to rely on a qualitative description of the route? My thanks to @gerrit for raising this in Chat. He declined to post a question. As for kloofing, it seems to be canyoneering with a South African accent. 

A lot depends on where you live and where you ski, but unless you've got solid enough skiing skills to manage ungroomed terrain at a resort, you'll struggle a lot backcountry skiing in a typical situation where AT or telemark gear would be used. There is an entire range of gear from relatively light XC touring gear to full on Alpine setups that can be used for touring in the backcountry. The trick is to pick the gear that most closely matches your current skills and the terrain you plan to ski. Without knowing more about your situation, I'd suggest spending a season focusing on improving your alpine skills and then maybe look into getting an appropriate AT setup. Learning on AT gear is not really a great idea. The release mechanisms aren't anywhere as near as reliable as regular alpine bindings and the gear is built around the idea that it's for relatively expert skiers who don't fall often. While it may seen cheaper to just get one AT setup, alpine gear is often much cheaper. New AT bindings often twice the cost of basic alpine bindings. It's also much easier to get used alpine gear that is still in good shape. If you decide to stick with it, you can later have AT bindings put on your alpine skis. Or even get a plate that will allow you to switch bindings easily. This question is almost impossible to answer without a lot more details about where and when you are skiing. It's also very important to get some appropriate Avalanche education if you are venturing into the backcountry. 

I've hiked from the Valley to the Rim on the Snow Creek Trail in late April, but late March..... Much depends on your level of ability. There are people who would think nothing of getting to the High Country from the Valley in January. You can't count on the weather. How long would you be there? My bottom line is that, in late March, you may be confined to the Valley plus maybe the first 1,500 feet above the Valley plus the open part of Tioga Pass Road. And there may be weather for a day or three. On the other hand, the Valley will be spectacular and uncrowded and the waterfalls should be awesome. There is nothing like Yosemite. Note: Many, maybe most, visitors never go beyond the Valley. 

These are generally known as glacier glasses. They are rated as Category 4 on the CE scale and you aren't supposed to drive while wearing them. Sunglasses in Category 4 only transmit 4-8% of available visible light. Hidalogos sunglass guide has a very complete list of the different factors in choosing sunglasses. Category 4 come in a wider range of styles than in the past. Julbo in particular makes several models that don't resemble the classic leather side flap models. I can recommend their Zebra photochromic lens, but that may not work for you. Category 3 might work for you as well, most standard sunglasses are only Category 2. You need to buy "sport" sunglasses to get Category 3 level glasses. You can get prescription versions of some versions of these sunglasses.
