An action is an event with an actor. Events don't have to have actors. If I explode a bomb, then I'm the actor in the explosion event. But if the bomb goes off by itself, there's no actor, though the explosion is still an event. 

No, the conflicting claims about what was said are not necessarily a phonetic issue. We ordinarily refer to what was intended or perceived to be said when quoting or otherwise characterizing what someone said. For instance, if you say "Ib probably" that might well be interpreted, and quoted as "I'd probably", because in American English, a t/d/n before a word starting with p/b/m often becomes a labial, pronounced with the two lips, in partial agreement with the following labial p/b/m. This and perhaps further phonetic changes could make "I'd probably", as measured by instruments, sound like "I probably". 

No, auxiliary verbs don't always express something other than simple indicative. Yes, there are cases where a sentence with an auxiliary verb is in the simple indicative. For instance, "Hal is a fisherman." The "is" is an auxiliary verb, since it inverts with the subject in the corresponding yes-no question "Is Hal a fisherman?", and it is a simple indicative. 

I don't see the problem. If you know how to handle restrictive relative clauses, then you must know how to handle adverbial clauses. The example "you can sit where you like" means "you can sit in any place in which you like to sit". Except for some superficial syntax, the "adverbial clause" is a restrictive relative already. (Jonnie and Mike Geis both wrote dissertations at the University of Illinois proposing this kind of analysis.) I don't know what it would mean for an adverb clause to modify a verb. But anyhow, that's not what they do. 

Joseph Conrad is said to have complained about losing facility in his native language, Polish, after speaking and writing in English for many years. He, of course, had become a great master of English prose (though he always spoke English with a Polish accent). 

Logic concerns inference. Can you infer questions? Can you infer imperatives? Perhaps, but if so, by introducing assumptions about the nature of human conversation. I don't see why an extension of logic principles or representations would be necessary. You can represent nondeclaratives, if you want, in a notation resembling that of predicate logic, but it's not clear that these would count as "logical representations". There are some proposals about representation of questions in McCawley's The Syntactic Phenomena of English, which help to make clear some subtle matters of scope. 

Using the usual notation of Generative Phonology, that could be formulated: V -> [1 stress] / ##C0__ (where the 0 is a subscript). 

If a phonological rule of the language changes X to Y in a position, then X and Y do not contrast in that position. Otherwise, they do contrast in that position. So, the answer depends on what the phonological system of the language is, which you must know somehow (or at least guess at). Writing rr for the tilde-r (for convenience), your answer (which I agree with) is consistent with the phonological system having the rules: 

I can't tell you what is correct (since I'm a descriptive linguist), but judging from what I use and hear from others, I think you use "were" in a counterfactual when the style is formal, and "was" when either the style is informal or you don't wish to commit yourself about the truth of the antecedent clause. E.g., "If I were a prescriptive linguist, I'd tell you to use "were" if you were being formal and I was actually not a prescriptive linguist." 

and finally "can" moves out of the way because it has to be inverted with the subject of the upstairs Q, 

Words are the minimal forms that speakers memorize. (There might be exceptions to that general principle.) There are several peculiarities of words not shared by other expressions, but so far as I know, there is no good discovery procedure for words -- that is, there is no set of observable facts about an expression that give a definite answer about whether or not it is a word. In that respect, words are like phonemes. Giving the words of a language is like giving the phoneme inventory; it is part of a theory of the language. There is no way of knowing for sure that it is entirely correct. Theories can be wrong. And it is probably no accident that not only do words and phonemes share this abstract property, but also that words are always made of phonemes, with the exception of words made up of a single morpheme with some non-native sounds in it (I'm thinking here of "Bach" [bax], but I'm not sure whether the [x] always reverts to /k/ when an affix is added.) 

It seems to me that you are asking whether what matters is what you start out with or what you wind up with. Broadly speaking, transformational/generative grammar counts what you start with (you could say it's "speaker oriented"), while non-transformational phrase structure grammar counts what you wind up with (you could say it's "hearer oriented"). Your examples look, at first sight, as if what counts is what you wind up with, since in all the cases, you're left with a single constituent. As a matter of terminology, it would not be wise to say that an ellipsis which removes everything except for a NP as NP-ellipsis, because people would think you meant that a NP was elided, not that it was left behind. 

Professional phonologists need a notation that distinguishes a theory or a perception of pronunciation, for which they often use slashes, from actual facts about the pronunciations, for which they often used square brackets. In part, this is because a phonologist will usually be aware of several different theories about a given interesting pronunciation. Without a systematic way of distinguishing fact from theory, a phonologist's world would be even more confusing than it is. 

There seem to be three issues here. (1) Why is "I sometimes pet bunnies" second order, in view of the fact that it seems to mean about the same as "I pet bunnies"? What is the second order logical form? (2) Reichenbach's idea about second order logic is that it involves quantifying over predicates. His example was "Napoleon had all the properties of a great general", which he gave a translation roughly like (For all properties P)(For all great generals G)(if P(G) then P(Napoleon)). This doesn't seem much like "I sometimes pet bunnies". (3) Dragging in non-binary truth values seems gratuitous. 

Disclaimer: I don't know Arabic, but this Youtube video video sounds good, to me. Except, I suspect there may be some confusion in the articulatory explanation given. What the speaker is describing is an articulation produced by retracting the root of the tongue, which I think is better described as uvularization than pharyngealization. Both of these are ways to narrow the pharynx, but retracting the tongue root does not necessarily use the pharyngeal muscles in the throat, which are used in swallowing. For uvularization, the "deepening" of the tone, and the association with lip rounding, can be explained as being due to enlarging the cavity of the mouth. When the tongue is retracted, its front portion occupies less room in the oral cavity, and the larger cavity produces a lower pitched resonance. Lip rounding also produces a lower pitched resonance, but in a different way, since the oral cavity is in effect lengthened in front of the lips. But I don't see why contracting the pharyngeal muscles should have this "deepening" effect on tonality. 

To place syntax in a more general context, many use some version of Charles Morris's taxonomy of the general theory of signs, Morris, Charles (1938), Foundations of the Theory of Signs (Chicago: University of Chicago Press). My version of it is partly due to what Richmond Thomason says about it in his logic text, and partly due to what McCawley says about grammar in his text. A language, or sign system, concerns the signs themselves, the significance of the signs in the world, the people who use the signs. The study of what signs and combinations of them are part of a language is morphology, according to Thomason, but grammar according to McCawley. Following linguistic tradition, morphology has a different sense -- the structure of words -- so with McCawley, I use grammar for this. The study of the relations of signs to one another is syntax, including the study of implication, which is logical syntax. This is how McCawley uses the term. The study of the relation between signs and the world is semantics. This is generally how logicians and philosophers use this term, at least in principle, but linguists usually use semantics to mean some sort of syntax. The study of how people use the signs in reference to things in the world is pragmatics. Using the terms in this way, I would say that the original question is actually about grammar rather than syntax. In usage by linguists, the terms grammar and syntax are extremely fluid. My own main interest is in grammar, but in contrast, McCawley arrived at the view that grammar is both uninteresting and undoable (these are my words, though, not his). Thomason's text that I refer to is Symbolic Logic: An Introduction. McCawley's text is The Syntactic Phenomena of English.
