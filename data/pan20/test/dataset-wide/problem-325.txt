The other answers are good so far, but I don't think anyone has pointed out that there's another way to easily lower the difficulty of getting off an alien planet: just reduce the gravity and/or atmospheric density. A smaller planet with less atmosphere is significantly easier to take off from. Even though the delta-V required to reach low Earth orbit is 9.4 to 10.0 km/s, that required to reach low Mars orbit is only 4.1 km/s. Source 1, Source 2, Source 3 To see what a thick atmosphere does, take a look at the number for Venus: 27.0 km/s! Remember, doubling delta-v more than doubles the mass of the rocket, as it's an exponential relationship. 

You could use a Momentum Exchange Tether. I first saw this concept in the Neal Stephenson novel, Seveneves. The concept is that being on the end of the rotating tether, you get decelerated with respect to the surface of the Earth while the other end is accelerated. At the lowest point, you disconnect and just fall down, since you're now at almost zero horizontal velocity. The deceleration is (potentially) nice and slow. 

Given the age of the solar system, and the fact it's made up of stuff from earlier solar systems, if there was another physical mechanism with these same properties and the tendency to actually occur naturally, it's likely it would have happened by now, and we would see lots of it everywhere. The only explanation for not seeing it is that the conditions on Earth, and on other bodies we've visited, aren't suitable for this stuff to exist. 

Genetic engineering has come a long ways now form it's humble beginnings with Dolly to artificial organs, it's only a matter of time before we are making brand new animals to use for circuses, sports or pets. Of course companies would want to patent the design they put years into making but considering that animals are infinitely complex in design how could they? Ignoring all the problems with playing god, how would the genetic engineering companies patent a biological blueprint and have it hold up in court? 

How will the nations of the world(specifically Russia, America, Canada and Austrailia) react to this new threat? 

Until a few dozen years ago most cultures on earth were extremely racist, everything from colored bathrooms to slavery. But in a world where along with multiple races there are multiple species would racism overrule 'specism'? There are 2 species in question here; 

Could animals evolve to live in such a harsh environment in the same way that in could on the day side? If animals could exist on the night side, how would they survive, with the lack of vegetation, light and heat? If an animal from the day side were to get caught in the night, could it survive and for how long? 

On my planet, the whole day lasts nine years. The day lasts 4.5 years of incredible heat, with glaciers from the night providing water. The night starts with the sunset, during which violent tornadoes occur and enters into the night lasting four and a half years before another set of tornadoes and then the cycle restarts. Animals migrate to survive these conditions but plants cannot do this. Many plants other than trees just spread their seeds and die during the winter in the real world. How would annual plants such as trees and cacti survive tornadoes as well as four and a half years of darkness and cold? 

You needn't look any further than many failed states. When a country can't pay its debts, the typical response of the government is to just print money. This causes Hyperinflation and causes everyone to try to divest themselves of the useless currency. In other words, the currency itself becomes worthless. Assets still have the value they always had, such as food, clothing, and fuel. Some items that have real value but are also durable and portable may actually rise in value because they can be used as a new form of money. Historically this has been gold, but it could be anything. Cigarettes are a form of currency in prisons. Batteries, non-perishable food, and medicine seem like great candidates. A lot of people's investments aren't actually money, but stocks. If you own a stock, you own a portion of a company, which is really an asset. Assuming that company can figure out how to stay in business and produce their product for some kind of profit, then that stock still has value. If nothing else, that stock may entitle you to a share of their assets if they liquidate (but it depends on the type of share). There are other alternatives to cash though. Let's say as soon as the aliens started dropping money, the government declared that all cash was worthless, but all deposits were still valid. A bank, for instance, only keeps 5% of the on-deposit money as cash. When you deposit \$100 in your account, the bank loans out \$95 of that, and that person typically deposits it in their bank account (or spends it meaning the seller deposits the money) and then the bank loans out 95% of that \$95, and so on. The net result is called the "money multiplier" and it ultimately means that the amount of money in circulation is only 5% cash. It's hard for me to understand what this would mean, if suddenly only that 5% became worthless. Could we just switch to a cashless society? How does the government continue to manage the money supply? One option would be something like Bitcoin. One could imagine a crypto-currency where only the government had the keys necessary to authenticate a transaction. This would be some kind of centralized electronic currency (instead of the distributed nature of Bitcoin). Countries have gone through periods of Hyperinflation and then stabilized by issuing a new currency. If you immediately say "cash" is worthless but money on deposit has value, and you immediately start issuing a new digitally-authenticated currency where the value was one-to-one the same as your existing denominations, and you offered some kind of replacement plan for the banks that hold most of the cash currency (the amount they have on hand at the moment the aliens started dropping cash could probably be authenticated by an audit) then it just might work, and the world could avoid big financial system problems. 

No... well it depends Everything you know is correct, but the answer depends if the civilization is there before or after sapience evolves. 

Absolutely Many animals use projectiles and even more use poison, some creatures like the Spitting Cobra even use projectile poison. Thus there is no evolutionary reason why a creature couldn't spit poison, now at a high enough concentration alcohol is poisonous so by that logical a creature could indeed evolve to spit alcohol as a poison (most likely directed at the eyes). Now all that is needed is a catalyst and the alcohol with light aflame. Here is yet another example we already have, electricity is a common weapon many animals use All that is needed is for a land creature to use electricity (maybe for mating or threatening) somewhere near the mouth and whoosh, you have alcohol based fire breath. 

Parasite are very unusual creatures, their entire livelihood relies on an unwilling host to allow them to live, some parasite even control the creature itself! Despite this, to my knowledge, there are no parasites that are very intelligent, never mind sapient. My question is what sort of parasitic species design could possibly develop sapience, and what forces would encourage and lead to that development? 

In my world, automation reaches a new level with the introduction of androids. Robotic human beings capable of doing any job a regular person can. The concept of these androids is that they can be used in a wide variety of jobs as opposed to simpler robotic workers. At a certain point in my world, I want these androids to be less like slaves and even gain rights and freedoms. To achieve this however, they must want to have these rights and freedoms; which means they would need to be sapient and self aware to an extent. Obviously this is a problem with the public scare concerning Artificial Intelligence. How do I justify an android being programmed with self awareness? How close can I get to justifying an android being truly human as far as the mind goes? 

It's not that far fetched to believe that the alien technology will be fragile. Our most advanced technology (aircraft, spacecraft, laboratory robotics) are in fact quite fragile. One of the main difficulties in space travel is that the energy required scales up dramatically with mass, and this would be even more the case in travel between stars. There is currently a project called Breakthrough Starshot that's investigating sending tiny wafer-thin sensing devices from Earth to the next closest star system at about 20% of the speed of light. If successful, these will be tiny incredibly fragile devices, built to be as light as possible. They'll barely have the capability to take some readings and pictures of the surrounding area and send them back to Earth. Certainly the designers aren't going to give any thought to security or defense. The attacker in an interstellar war has one big disadvantage: they have to move their force across an incredibly large distance, with all the logistical problems that entails, weakening them the entire way. Now imagine there's an alien race on the receiving end of these Breakthrough Starshot probes. Assuming they could figure out the basic purpose and mechanisms that make them work (possibly by intercepting a transmission from one back to Earth), it may be quite simple to interrupt their function. That's really the root question: can we understand how the alien technology works, and what its limitations are? If we can, there's a good chance we can find a weakness and exploit it. Of course, one can always come up with a more powerful technology. Some kind of grey goo bomb could be delivered almost undetectably and relatively inexpensively across interstellar distances, and cause enormous destruction once it arrives. What you're really sending in that case is self-replicating information - a pattern that makes copies of itself. Information is one of the least expensive things to send anywhere. However, we do have ways of combating self-replicating machines (in fact we have them here now and call them bacteria and viruses). In general, we look at them under a microscope, figure out how they work, and attack them in one of two ways: quarantine, or medicine. Medicine is just a form of chemical attack on the device... figure out something it needs and take it away, or figure out how it works, and introduce a chemical that sabotages it. The basis of self-replication on Earth is DNA and we have a pretty good understanding of how it works, but also how to stop it.
