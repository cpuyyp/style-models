Henri Lefebvre wrote a book Dialectical Materialism to attempt to divorce DM from its vulgarization by Stalinists and official Communist party philosophers and develop it as a form of "logic." I consider this book to be a little too Hegelian and philosophically concerned for it to be in the tradition of Engels' Anti-Duhring and Dialectics of Nature. A more recent book I found, Dialectical Social Sciences in the Age of Complexity by Ian Trevor King, has acid art and a ying-yang on the cover and a photo of the author wearing beads on the back but it is a surprisingly good synopsis of DM and its relevance to the Social Sciences. Lukacs' History and Class Consciousness is a classic in literary analysis and philosophy. David Harvey is not explicitly a theorist of DM but he uses DM principles in his political economy and geography. I would also look at Slavoj Zizek, particularly The Indivisible Remainder, The Parallax View, and Less than Nothing: Hegel in the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism for his heterodox account, although be prepared for a fair amount of Hegelian and Lacanian introjections. (He also has an upcoming book Absolute Recoil: Towards A New Foundation Of Dialectical Materialism, which should be elucidating). The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism by J.A. Jordan is an older book but it traces the evolution of DM and its influences on French positivism and sociology via Compte and its philosophical revision through Lenin, Stalin, and Plekhanov. I found several recent articles on my university library's search engine: "Dialectical Materialism and Geography" by M. D. Day and J. M. Wagstaff which is a defense of DM as a "scientific method" that can be used in geography. "The Crisis in Physics: Dialectical Materialism and Quantum Theory" by Andrew Cross which traces the history of DM in the debates arising from of statistical quantum mechanics. "Dialectical Materialism and Nature: An Alternative to Economism and Deep Ecology" by Brett Clark and Richard York uses DM to critique the dominant theoretical paradigms in political ecology. "Common Prescriptions for Psychology Derived from Dialectical Materialism and Chaos Theory" by Albert R. Gilgen is by far the most interesting article I found, it is a reconstruction of a Soviet project to create a psychology that was "consonant" with Marxist-Leninism. The synopsis states: 

Is there a name for this situation? Is it negligence, indifference? What if, deity forbid, in the second list item the human was an infant? And is there laws around this? Would anything change if the individuals that have resources have access to a vast abundance of resources? 

For example, "You are rich because you are blessed (God blessed you with riches). If you are not rich then you must not be blessed (God chose not to bless you oh ye of little faith)." Second example, "By the super secret law of attraction you can manifest riches in your life. If you don't have riches it is because you did not attract it into your life you stupid idiot. It's so easy. Do you hate money?" Does this make sense? 

I finished an interesting book today about some characters and a discussion ensued. I won't name the book but the scenario has been seen before. There is a character, supposed evil villain, let's say his name is Bobo. We don't know his past. The group of protagonists have an argument. One called Bobo evil and says it's the inside that counts. Another person said it's not our words or thoughts in the end but our actions that determine our character. Not sure how to word this so question is: 

You're conflating a random sample with some measured characteristic of that sample. Suppose you're studying peoples' heights. And suppose you have some procedure that really, really selects a random sample of people from the total population. Then, despite your people sample being really random, the collection of numbers representing their measured heights are likely normally (or thereabouts) distributed. The randomly selected people themselves have no "distribution", per se. Only the measured observable, height. So suppose instead you had a hat full of one million slips of paper, numbered (you guessed it) one to a million. Then, if you truly randomly select a sample of slips from the hat, you'd indeed expect a uniform distribution of numbers. If you found a normal (or anything but uniform) distribution, then guess what -- your sampling procedure's not so random after all. 

As briefly cited about halfway-down the "hardly new" link posted by @TimBII, it's the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, e.g., $URL$ (google "Sapir-Whorf" for many other references), that directly investigates exactly what you're suggesting. 

Most of the other books and articles on dialectical materialism are far older and are more concerned with its exposition and dissemination rather than original theorizing (I've actually found some old Soviet era logic textbooks which are fascinating but useless). 

I'm reading The Principles of Non-Philosophy and re-reading Philosophy and Non-Philosophy by François Laruelle and I keep coming across this description of the philosophical decision described as a "fractional matrix in 2/3rd terms." For example he states in the first work: 

Ross Wolf (see $URL$ states that it is a reference to Hegel's "henology" and describes it in the Fichtean terms of thesis-antithesis-synthesis: "The “3” side invariably refers to the transcendentally exterior “synthesis,” while the “2” refers to the immanently interior dualism of “thesis” and “antithesis” (to use crude Fichtean terms)." However, I still want to know that the significance of Laruelle's use of a fractional matrix is. Can anyone conceptualize this or define a "fractional matrix" in either layman's terms or "philo-speak"? 

Derrida is hard to sum up but can someone define his notion of "dissemination" or does anyone know a good passage where he defines it? I know that Derrida writes on dissemination and has an original theory of it but I haven't encountered it in the "majors," namely, Of Grammatology and Writing and Difference. I've been writing on the transmission of knowledge and the reproduction of subjectivity and looking at Kant's notion of genius, disciples and the preservation and transmission of artistic technique through education and I think Derrida's perspective would be useful. 

Well, no unambiguous answer, but it's somewhat a difference between "craftsmanship" and "intentionality", and you're asking whether or not art necessarily involves craftsmanship. Malevich is presumably asking you to consider more or less exactly that, what comprises art -- exactly what you're asking, whereby he's achieved his purpose. A school-child's black circle presumably wouldn't convey the same connotation. And phooey to black circles -- Robert Rauschenberg has some entirely blank canvases $URL$     And Duchamp's urinal $URL$ is (I believe) more or less taken to be the first such work. To paraphrase (link below) the overall viewpoint, there's no such thing as objective art, only our interpretations of it. Every generation takes from the past what it needs to make sense of itself. You and I cannot see in an ancient Greek work of art what an ancient Greek saw. A really terrific video about all this is at $URL$     Scroll down to Episode 9 at the very bottom, and click the VOD link on the right-hand-side to watch it. It's Part II that's particularly relevant to our discussion. I think you'll find it  ......... FASCINATING  :) 

I would like to get a better understanding of the juxtaposition of wealth and poverty. By wealth I mean the situation where one has resources as opposed to one that does not. Consider the following situations: A1. A man sits at a table filled with food A2. A man sits at a table filled with food while next to him is a human starving next to him. The human next to him is weak and on crutches (to signify how poverty can be limiting in range and mobility) B1. A man sitting in the park has a bucket of water B2. A man sitting in the park has a bucket of water while there is a human next to him who is on fire C1. There is a group with access to large amounts of water and food C2. There is a group with access to large amounts of water and food while there is a human on fire and a human starving next to them I would gather that if you asked people if the situation listed in the first list item was in any way right or wrong then they would say there is nothing wrong with a person eating or drinking. But if you asked people about the second list item they would say that is something wrong. 

I don't know about "physicalism" as far as its metaphysical denotations/connotations go, but as far as physics goes the answer is "no", i.e., not everything can be defined. That's erroneously contradicted by $URL$ where Peres states his "G* Strong superposition principle. Any orthogonal basis represents a realizable maximal test." It's realizable that's the key word here. There are an uncountably infinite number of possible orthogonal bases (an elementary fact from functional analysis), but only a countably infinite number of constructible test apparatus (there are several references about that, but I'm not offhand finding them). And that boils down to the existence of states that can neither be prepared nor tested for (contrary to Peres). And, like I parenthetically mentioned, I know I've read several such references, and will edit this to cite them if I come across them. I'd typically leave it at that, but since this is philosophy rather than physics, I like to more (much more) broadly (and entertainingly) think of the above idea along the lines (perhaps in the spirit) suggested by Jean Giraudoux in The Madwoman of Chaillot (the first sentence is what's directly relevant, the rest icing on the cake), 

FYI I've list four interrelated questions but answers to any of them would prove helpful. EDIT: I wrote "what is the ethic response" but I meant to write "what is the ethical / unethical" response. Once I know this I want to know basically, if there is a discussion around if it is wrong to let someone die who you have the power to help. I know there are some legally obligations to help or not help (good samaritan law) but I still don't know the names or concepts that already exist around this scenario. Or the argument I was only doing my job the Nazis used during WWII. So far the argument is legal right and wrong but specieial (species related) right or wrong. 

If you watch Dr Who you will know somewhat what I'm talking about but I've seen same question in other stories, Naruto, for example etc. My real question is based in politics. Let's say the process, as it is, of becoming a politician or it could be any position, results in someone being corrupted or turning evil, but a strange thing happens in one person where in the end that person makes the right choices, how do you describe that person's character? I'm not talking about anything recent, but something recent reminded me of this question that I've had for a while I'm sure everyone has had this question. If I become "this" [insert position] will it corrupt me? If I do [insert thing] will it change me? Etc Note: I say "evil" but maybe it's corruption. 

...I'm referring to $URL$ where Searle (who's basically a "raving materialist":) makes the following (paraphrased here) remark, which uncharacteristically moderates his materialist position: Even if a computer could be "perfectly programmed" to simulate the brain, it wouldn't actually possess consciousness; no more than a simulation of the weather can actually get you wet. Okay, so that sounds really reasonable, at least in some formal argument way. But I (also a materialist) just don't quite buy it. What I instead buy is another analogy, whose source I don't recall, to the effect that: the brain is like a lightbulb, whereas mind/consciousness is like the light. In this case, any "lightbulb" -- either wetware brain or "perfectly programmed" hardware computer -- would generate equivalent "visible light". So both arguments/analogies seem pretty reasonable to me, at least as far as reason can take you in these kinds of discussions. But each seems to invalidate the other. So what's wrong with which? Or how do you reconcile them? (And what, if any, conclusions can you draw?, although I assume those would be pretty tenuous, at best.) 

After a quick search for skepticism it seems that the term is heavily peroidized, referring to the school of Pyrrhonism in the 1st BC its subsequent rediscovery in the 17th century. So it seems there aren't really any contemporary philosophical skeptics (although in some abstracts of papers on skepticism I found Marx and Derrida came up). Its possible the term has degraded since skepticism is usually supplemented with some sort of empiricism or realism and where it isn't it typically manifests as nihilism. I've become rather hesitant to define François Laruelle's non-philosophy since I don't want to misrepresent it but I will offer it here as the most contemporary thinking through of the implications of what you called Nietzsche's philosophical skepticism (although I would define Nietzsche's project more as an anti-philosophy). One of the basic gestures of non-philosophy is to critique the notion of thought's "sufficiency" to comprehend and conceptualize reality (the "Real"). Put in overly simplistic terms, it posits that the Real is foreclosed to thought and is thus unphilosophizable. The only way it becomes philosophizable or conceptualizable is if it is "decided" which is the inaugurating gesture of all systematic philosophies. I won't go on from there but you can see how it takes up the themes of certain skeptical philosophies. The most representative work is Philosophie Non-Standard which sadly remains untranslated but The Principles of Non-Philosophy was recently translated into English and is considered the most advanced presentation of Laruelle's thought. Deleuze and Guattari are also a good place to look for philosophers taking up the style and thematics of Nietzsche (although this can be said of most of the French theory that emerged in the late 60's) but are hardly as readable. If you are feeling more poetic, I would look into E.M. Cioran. In terms of a contemporary "rigorous" empirical skepticism, there is no one better than Wittgenstein. If you want to go back to the historical manifestations of skepticism with some contemporary commentary, Richard H. Popkin looks like a good place to start (though I haven't read him myself). 

You're talking about the mean (first moment), as opposed to the variance (second moment), etc, and perhaps more directly about quantiles. See $URL$   and   $URL$   or just google   "statistics moments quantiles"   for detailed discussions. 

Could be different. What you're asking about is the mathematically defined difference between a poset and a preorder. Both are characterized by a ≤ relation, typically called "weaker than". For a poset, a≤b and b≤a implies a=b, which is called the antisymmetry condition. For a preorder, a≤b and b≤a doesn't imply equality. You can google those words for some examples of preorders that aren't posets. 

Referring to $URL$ (and many similar stories you can google about this incident). This may be somewhat off-topic, but can't think where else to ask. Note that the guy was a "former philosophy professor". Nevertheless, none of the articles I saw mentioned the (glaringly obvious to me) parallel. So, is he trying to make a statement? Compare himself or his situation to the historical one? Or just trying to off himself as conveniently as possible? Or what? Edit: By the way, as well as a "former philosophy professor", I just noticed that he was also a "theater director" (and, boy, talk about your "performance art").
