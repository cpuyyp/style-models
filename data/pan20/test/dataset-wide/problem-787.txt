Fast-moving objects near our earth have different paths in the sky. They are different with stars far away. For telescopes, when we do not know an object's orbit, catching up with its orbit and not losing it is a problem ? How to figure out a new object's orbit parameters quickly before we lose it? For an old object with an irregular orbit, can a telescope track it? The typical speed in the asteroid belt may be smaller than 1"/min? But there may be faster objects. Then the paths are not so simple and regular. 

Vela X-1 has a 283s spin period, while this one may have a 2.7hr spin period. However neither of them is included in ATNF catalog. They are not included in $p-\dot{p}$ diagram either. The longest period is just about 10s in this diagram. My question is since Vela X-1 is definitely a pulsar, why is it not accepted? Which one has the longest spin period so far? 

Solar radiation is strong. Following problems for solar telescopes may be telescope site selection and temperature control. I wonder the telescopes themselves and their instruments are different? 

Most of the spectroscopic surveys like SDSS classify stars into one pure spectral type. However, a large fraction of stars are in binaries. Can we know whether a spectral fitting is good enough? Is there something like $\chi^2$? In other words, is it possible we can estimate the probability that a star is in a binary based on one spectrum? 

I met this kind of finding chart before, but now I can not easily find one in ADS. The small window in the upper left is a zoomed-in version of the window in the center. Could anybody identify any finding chart like the attachment in ADS and specify how to generate it? 

Is there a clear cut between them? How long and how bright will the moon be for a dark night? I googled but could not find a definition for them. People just talk about them empirically? 

The LIGO team argue they detected the merger of two solar mass black holes($36M\odot+29M\odot-3M\odot$) at z=0.09. My questions are It seems GW has Doppler shift too. There is a GW spectrum with emission or absorption lines like optical spectrum? Figure.2 of the PRL paper seems to be very simple. Generally, people take their masses derived seriously? There may be other models which can give different masses. It is different from Taylor binary which was observed many years. What does a 100HZ GW mean? That is the frequency of the two arms shrink and extend? What does the frequency stand for in the binary system? The discovery can not be confirmed. DO you think the team win a Nobel prize only after other facilities like LISA find GW again? 

We need to calculate P/Pdot? A pulsar may switch between theses two states. For a rotation powered pulsar, it can pulse and, the pulsed Lx can be much larger than the luminosity given by its rotation? If Lx is very small, smaller than the luminosity given by its rotation, how to tell it is rotation-powered or accretion-powered? There are not necessarily X-ray pulsations You can see I am asking a very tricky scenario. 

A handful of other artificial satellites might be visible, but only rarely. Comets can be very visible, but again that's rare. Visible asteroids are even rarer. Vesta, a large asteroid, may be barely visible, but I've never seen it. Note that some of these objects are quite obviously not distant stars just based on their appearance. Some galaxies (Andromeda, and the two Magellanic Clouds if you're far enough south) are visible, but they don't look like stars. A few of the brighter nebulas and globular clusters might be visible; the latter are groupings of stars, so I don't know how they'd count. Meteors and aircraft can be visible, but they're within the atmosphere, and probably not covered by your question. 

My understanding is that the Big Bang took place everywhere. That "one spot" expanded into the Universe as we see it now. There is no distinguished spot within the current Universe corresponding to the Big Bang. 

It's almost 100% stars. In good conditions, you can see perhaps 2000 stars. (There are about 6000 naked-eye visible stars; of these, 3000 are above the horizon at any time, and about 1000 are hidden because they're too close to the horizon and blocked by the atmosphere.) The number of non-star objects you can see without assistance is tiny in comparison: 

It depends greatly on the nature of your "hypothetical spacecraft". Any spacecraft travelling through interstellar space will have to deal with interstellar gas and dust. At sufficiently high relativistic velocities, running into a hydrogen atom is like being hit by a high-energy cosmic ray, and running into a dust particle could seriously ruin your afternoon. The intergalactic medium has substantially less matter than the interstellar medium within the galaxy. A route that exits the body of the galaxy by going "galactic north", then travels parallel to the disk, then re-enters the galaxy at another point will obviously be longer than a straight-line route, but it will encounter significantly less matter along the way. If the maximum safe velocity of the USS Hypothetical depends strongly on the density of the medium through which it's travelling, then the indirect route could be faster. Whichever route you choose, this will take a long time. You should bring a book and plenty of snacks. 

The quotation is from the Wikipedia article on Tyche. The article gives the following references for the statement: 

No. Let's say we want to see Earth as it was 1000 years ago. Assume that someone has set up a perfect mirror 500 light-years away, so that we can actually see the light that left Earth 1000 years ago. (That's a really big assumption.) The best telescopes in the world can't see the Apollo landing sites from Earth. We didn't get decent images of the descent stages, which were left on the surface, until the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter sent back photos it took from Lunar orbit. See $URL$ 1000 light-years is about 20 billion times as far away as the Moon. There's no way we could see people's faces at that distance with current technology -- or with any reasonable future technology. (There are physical limits on the resolution of an optical telescope of a given size.) And all this assumes that we have that perfect mirror out there. As far as I know, nobody has set up such a mirror for us, and all the light that left Earth 1000 years ago is now 1000 light-years away, badly faded, and beyond our reach. It's conceivable that we could develop faster-than-light travel (which may or may not be physically possible), go out there, build a telescope with a really big aperture, and point it back at Earth. But that's not likely to happen any time soon, and I wouldn't know how to determine how good an image we might be able to get. And going back millions of years just makes the problem worse. 

Generally a telescope can memorize how to point to a target with a particular RA&Dec. There is no need to calibrate every day. How can it happen? How to let the telescope(non-amateur) know the position of a star after it was built? For an amateur telescope, how to realize it? There should be a zero point? How often should the calibration be? 

@tefalya Somebody told me "EM is the integral of electron density squared over the emitting volume. In collisional ionized plasmas, it gives the amount of material emitting at a given temperature. In the low density regime, temperature, emission measure, and abundance together with an atomic code completely specify the observed spectral energy distribution of coronal plasma. The normalization parameter you get out of APEC, MEKAL, etc. relate to the emission measure. If you read the description of the APEC model in XSPEC, you will see that the normalization = 10^-14* n_e^2 dV/(4 !pi distance^2). The Emission Measure EM is n_e^2 dV, and has units of cm^-3. So the emission measure is an observable, and by assuming that the volume is not changing significantly during the flare, the changing emission measure is a proxy for the changing electron density." 

Red spectra of M stars are dominated by TiO(Titanium oxide) bands, which have become the primary means of establishing spectral types.see ApJ Why is TiO special? There should be much more Silicon elements than Titanium if we suppose the element abundance of M stars are similar to our sun.(Solar abundance is here). If similarï¼Œthere should be much more SiO2 than TiO? 

How to make random positions in Equatorial coordinate system? If I divide Dec between -90 and 90 evenly, the space distribution is not random. 

According to the wikipedia page big bear, water can cool the observatory. Big bear is in the southern California. It is better to build it on a cold high mountain with stable and clear atmosphere? What is the difference when building a solar and an optical telescope? Optical telescopes are usually not build on lakes. 

Since its targets are very bright and its sensitivity is relatively worse than Kepler, I wonder whether it can be replaced by gound-based-small-telescope arrays. There can be no gaps in the time series too. 

First I put a test spectrum below . In order to detect the shift of spectral lines, I need to do continuum fitting and subtraction first,right? My questions are: 1 Different lines have different widths, then how to smooth the continuum? 2 Absorption lines and emission lines can be done in the same way? 3 If I am just interested in several lines, e.g. 6563 an 4861, then I can detect lines in several narrow ranges, say, 6563+-3. It will become much easier? 4 How to get the line centroids? A simple Gaussian-fitting is enough? 

The data precision now can exclude a >>$1M_{\odot}$ black hole companion, which has a, say 10000 year orbital period with our sun? Can we draw a two dimensional diagram(Mass VS. distance) to show the region that is still a grey area? Within 1 pc, there is no stellar mass black hole? If there is one, the orbit change of objects in solar system may be detectable. How to calculate its proper motion or its planets' proper motion? I am serious to ask. Please give some reference/technical method to calculate PM. For example, is there some reference paper about the distance limitation of the black hole based on the motion of asteroids/comets?
