UPDATE: It turns out the story is a little more subtle and nuanced than retailed by Mr. Lebe and French Wikipedia. As yet I have not found an online copy of de Commynes' writings. What I have found is a Google e-book version of a 1984 monograph by Emile-Charles Varenbergh titled Mémoire sur Philippe de Commynes. While de Commynes may have been a loyal PR hack during his service for the Duke of Charolais, his writings published after Charles' death exhibit a much more reflective and at times wry tone regarding the exploits of his famous master. de Commynes recalls entering the service of the Duke as a young man in 1464. He quickly became his friend and confidante. The next year, the Duke rode into battle at the head of an army of "4,000 poorly armed and inept fighting men", with de Commynes always by his side. As the title of his memoirs -- Memoires de Commynes, ou Fragment de la comédie humaine -- indicates, the chronicler had an eye for the quirky and off-beat. He was a sharp observer of how the best-laid plans can go awry. The carefully thought-out battle plan at Montlhéry was soon thrown to the winds. The French King (Louis XI) had wanted to avoid conflict, yet the conflict took place. The Burgundians had planned on giving their infantry enough rest before the battle but in fact the men had had no rest, and in their eagerness to charge, they trampled over their own archers, giving the enemy time to retrench in safe positions. In any case the Burgundians profited from lack of discipline in their foes, enabling them to rout the enemy's right flank. But Charles, who had hurled himself almost alone at a large group of them, received a belly wound from a lance as well as a neck wound from a sword. Nightfall then separated the combatants, with the Burgundians camping on the battlefield. During the night, Charles counted his dead and wounded, expecting defeat if the enemy returned in the morning. Luckily for them, the King had beat a retreat during the night. Charles rejoiced in the victory and from that moment would never listen to advice again. On reading these descriptions, the word that comes to mind is "reckless" more than "bold". However -- I am now back to reading the French Wiki -- the first recorded instance of a chronicler calling Charles "The Bold" was not de Commynes': 

There was always a question of how one culture replaces another...in the Ubaid period, this transition is now thought to be a gradual adoption of one culture to the next as opposed to a violent overthrow and pottery is the number one reason we think that now. Pottery can also link civilizations via trade as there is a good potential pottery was one of our species first trade goods. If culture A possesses pottery that is very distinctly theirs, but we find evidence of this pottery within Culture B's cities, then we can surmise that trade has occurred in some manner (or war/plunder) between these two cultures. We can also link cities and culture that belong to like cultural groups by their pottery...when a city is uncovered, especially one dating back to 5000 BC and earlier, the abundance of pottery left behind becomes the easiest method of identifying the cultural grouping and period that the city ruins date to. Even a lack of pottery provides evidence of the period a people came from (PPNA, or pre-pottery neolithic A and later PPNB). We've also used Pottery to distinguish ages, just as we like to use 'Iron Age' and 'Bronze Age', 'pottery' and 'pre-pottery' are used as terms to distinguish a period of time in human development prior to the bronze age (starting in the 12000bc range to around 3800bc). Oddly this period is often lumped into what we broadly call the 'stone age', though it's a distinct age and stepping stone towards the bronze age. And finally...pottery was often artwork. $URL$ 

The Nazi regime had planned to stage a big show trial for Thälmann, Elser and other enemies of their rule after a victorious end to the war. That is why they kept them alive. But by 1944 even the diehards knew that the war was lost. Hitler and Himmler gave orders to have Elser and others like Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Wilhelm Canaris killed. There was no time and no resources for such a trial at that late stage in the war. A web site dedicated to the memory of Georg Elser shows a facsimile of the execution order for Elser. Dated 5 April 1945, the head of the Gestapo Heinrich Müller instructs the commandant of the Dachau concentration camp to have Elser discreetly executed and to announce his death from a "terror" (i.e., bombing) raid. Already in August 1944, they had disguised the murder of Ernst Thälmann as the casualty of an Allied bombing run. There would have been no propaganda value from announcing Elser's summary execution after six years of imprisonment. And as mentioned, a planned show trial which was to have indicted the British as the instigators of Elser's failed assassination of Hitler was no longer feasible at that time. They were not going to allow Elser, Thälmann and other high-profile opponents to see the end of the war. I have not been able to find any record of discussions among the Nazi leadership how their enemies should be disposed of and why they decided on the "cover story" of a bombing raid. Historian Peter Steinbach and political scientist Johannes Tuchel, probably the leading authorities on Elser and whose scholarship informs the above cited web site, do not touch on this point in their writings available online. Two possible motivations appear plausible: one, the regime still clung to the facade of "law and order". Executions without a figleaf of legality would have undermined that facade. And two, some in the regime might have deluded themselves into thinking that they could escape facing responsibility for their crimes after the war if evidence of their worst deeds were covered up, especially if they were hoping for a negotiated capitulation and perhaps even some form of continuity for themselves in power. 

Still looking for any reference to Peter the Great wanting to circumnavigate the globe...but this is the best I have after a day of looking. 

The British Empire was involved, though mainly through Canada (though this conflict occurred prior to Canada becoming a nation...actually you can argue that Canada became independent due to the American Civil war). Around 40k Canadians fought on the Union's side in one way or another, and Canada was key in the underground railroad. That being said...there is very conflicting information on this. Wikipedia would inform you that Canada sympathized with the North most heavily ($URL$ however note that there was some confederacy support in the maritime territories that produced some interesting scenario's such as the Chesapeake affair $URL$ (Short version is the Chesapeake was a union Steamer that was captured by the confederacy and brought to the Canadian maritimes where it found supporters for the confederacy). The Canadian encyclopedia also notes that the majority of the Canadian/British support (as far as enlisted soldiers) went to the Union $URL$ however :

While clearly everything in the film was done with an eye to how it would come across on the silver screen and historical accuracy was not the paramount goal, nonetheless the influence of medieval ornament and pattern on the costumes, too, is evident:

NASA had known experimentally what near weightlessness felt like at least since 1959, when the famous "Vomit Comet" had enabled humans to experience the condition for up to 25 seconds at a time. This plane followed a nearly parabolic flight path to produce the sensation of weightlessness. Hence there was no reason before the first human spaceflight to believe something terrible might happen to astronauts such as inner organs rupturing. 

The Kingdom of Makuria (Nubian peoples, think south of Egypt) was a Christian kingdom and I would suggest that is the likely homeland for Black people who made it into medieval Europe. It's heavily neglected (crusaders and Christianity tends to be portrayed solely as 'white', but that is heavily incorrect as three Christian kingdoms existed to the south of Egypt). You can find their Makurian presence in crusades, and this was a likely link back to France and England. From the 4th crusade comes a an account in Constantinople where the crusaders come across a Nubian man 

They couldn't. In this time frame, the Byzantine empire was thoroughly stretched financially from the wars in Persia (Byzantine - Sassanian wars) and later the Arabic wars. Their lands were struggling under harsh tax rates to support these armies as is and the devastation from the conflict started to impact what wealth the lands could produce. War is costly and the Byzantines were pushing a point where they could no longer afford war. The Western Empire was even worse off...the power squabbles hit almost absurd heights and there was no longer any consistency in leadership. Most western empire emperors were somewhat contested (and in some cases not even recognized by the eastern empire) and the ones that were recognized had horribly short reigns, usually coming to death at the hands of an assassin or their own army turning on them. Tax collectors and most officials were corrupt and held little loyalty to anyone but themselves, meaning what taxes were collected rarely ended up in Roman coffers (slaying the Roman officials/tax collectors and proclaiming oneself emperor happened a few times as well, such as the Gordinians in Carthage). There were a few periods where a loyal subject of Rome that wanted to pay his/her taxes couldn't find a representative to pay taxes to. For info on how absurd this got, Year of the Five Emperors (google it for details) was an outright absurd time (193ad), yet somehow the Romans managed to outdo themselves in 236 with the year of the six emperors (I really recommend reading the intro here: $URL$ you have a cruel tyrant, a young aristocrat revolt, an elderly emporer and his son, a jealous neighbor, riots in Rome, an army killing it's own general, and feuding co-emperors publicly put to death...all in under a year). 

A book by someone named McGilligan is cited as the source. I would disagree with Cairns, however, that 

(The Duke's forceful personality, which all the chroniclers describe as austere, virtuous and pitiless, pious and chaste, animated by an acute sense of honor, moved his contemporaries to attach to him a number of epithets: they nicknamed him The Daring, The Bellicose, even The Bold (le Téméraire), a term one encounters as early as 1484 in the writings of Thomas Basin, bishop of Lisieux.) Nonetheless -- French Wiki continues -- none of the 15th-century chroniclers consistently employ any of these epithets. Instead, "Charles de Bourgogne" is what he was typically called. Today we know him as Charles the Bold, but the changeover in the name was slow and gradual. In the 17th century, the Grand Dictionnaire Historique de Louis Moreri devotes an entry to Charles de Bourgogne, "nicknamed le Guerrier, le Hardi ou le Téméraire" (the Bellicose, the Daring, the Bold.) In the 18th century, Benedictine historian Dom Plancher still calls him Charles le Hardi. In the 19th century, during the Romantic Age in France and Belgium the epithet "Charles the Bold" took hold... but his 15th-century contemporaries more frequently had attached to him the nicknames Hardi, Travaillant, Guerrier, even Terrible. SUMMARY: The earliest recorded use of Téméraire to characterize Charles was in 1484 by Thomas Basin. Other epithets stuck to him more closely for a long time. It was not until the 19th century that Téméraire finally became the standard appellation. Why did this appellation stick and not one of the others? The cause is probably lost in the mists of history. However, given that an ancestor -- Philippe II de Bourgogne -- was already known as "le Hardi", it may have been due to a simple desire by historians to avoid any mix-up between the two. 

Historians appear to be correct that there is no conclusive evidence of this minority group settling in Bohemia. That being said, it is possible that a Bohemian would have met a sub-Saharan native. There were several African Christian Kingdoms during this time frame and they made their way on several occasions to Europe through Pilgrimages. You have pilgrimage sites in Bohemia dating to that time: $URL$ 

Not quite sure if this is a full answer to the question, but will try anyway. Iran has an interesting position in this war as they were kinda neutral yet pro-german at points...both the Soviets and British had identified the chance of a pro-german coup in Iran. Baku, an oil field in present day Azerbaijan, was actively sending fuels to Germany prior to the war. However in March 1940 the soviets launched a full scale invasion of northern Iran and took Baku and it's oil fields. The British also invaded (potentially with the support of the US) and attacked Iran, seizing the oil fields of Bander-I Shahpur and Abadan, destroying Irans fleet and air power in the process (The Shah in Iran compared Germany/Russia invasion of Poland to what the Allies did to Iran, the invasion was rapid and the spoils were quickly divided). I assume these are the oil fields you talk about to the south of the Caspian. Not sure on how accurate this source is here, but it will suggest that Russia and the Allies nearly went to war themselves over Iranian oil. $URL$
