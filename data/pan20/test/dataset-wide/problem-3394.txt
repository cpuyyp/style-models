That was perhaps a bit more personal perspective than appropriate for SE but I'm not sure in the absence of a comprehensive survey, anything more definitive can be said. As to the comparison of the position of Universal Grammar (UG) in linguistics to other sciences, it is nothing like relativity or natural selection. It is more like String Theory. It is one contentious (rather far-fetched in many people's opinion) way of fitting some of the spurious data into a model. As far as I can tell, UG can describe a lot less of the data and unifies a lot less of what we know about language than String Theory does. UG often goes hand in hand with evolutionary psychology which is also highly contentious and more talked about by outsiders than its true position within the sciences merits. As to a 'paradigm' in linguistics, I think a good place to start would be Dixon's 'Basic Linguistic Theory' which describes things like those jlawler mentioned in his comments - he describes concepts that are used by most linguists regardless of their theoretical framework. There are several competing theoretical frameworks (that may count as paradigms) of which perhaps these four are the most important: 

So in a way, IPA itself is used with a 'phonemic touch'. SAMPA is really a straightforward one-to-one mapping of IPA characters to ASCII characters. But because it has many fewer characters to deal with, it didn't make sense to just map the entire IPA to it. So SAMPA was developed for the needs of individual languages. What's more, it's mostly focused on segmental transcriptions and ignored prosody. There are other versions like X-SAMPA and SAMPROSA that try to make it more equivalent to the full IPA. However, even then it will only be used as phonetically or phonemically as IPA itself would be. You can find more info about the history and use of SAMPA on $URL$ 

I'm not sure there's an accepted term for this. I think this could still be conceived of as a type of 'linguistic relativity', though. Especially, since there's always an interplay between 'reality', culture, and language even in cases of the Sapir-Whorf style of relativity. Daniel Everett has been proposing a theory of how the Pirah√£'s evidentiality (and other) features are influenced by their cultural insistence on witness testimony for topics of conversation. He discusses it both in the context of and in contrast to linguistic relativity but I don't think he has a specific label for this position. (See e.g. this paper and his book). 

Yes, cognitive and construction grammars do take ambiguity into account. However, they have to give up a lot of the formal properties of traditional constituency and dependency grammars. It resolves the particular ambiguities you mention by not having a notion of things like constituents, dependents or complements. It simply treats all surface constructions as units that can be blended together and it is that blending that resolves ambiguities. So if I say, 'She hit the man with a bottle.' I have certain presuppositional knowledge as well as context to disambiguate (all part of the blend). This means that the context sets up certain mental spaces that will disambiguate this: 

To my knowledge, there is no single term that describes this situation. It is merely one of the many configurations that arise in multilingual environments. Also, there is not just one single way in which this arises. The examples could be. 

Let me try to provide an alternative answer to @limetom. It is a very good summary of the standard position in formal linguistics but does not answer all aspects of the question. 

Nonce is used in two senses in linguistics: 1) an 'occasionalism' - word used in a one off conversation and 2) a non-existent word (non-word) following the phonological patterns of the language used as distractors or targets in psycholinguistic experiments. In the first sense, 'nonce' is a type of neologism. With rare words, it is difficult to exactly determine what term to apply them and ultimately, it's not that important. It would appear that at least one dictionary actually lists claustrophilia and it has some other hits on Google, so it's not clear if it's a neologism or just a very rare words that some people may 'recreate' independently. Therefore, the type of word is not just a property of the lexical item itself but rather of the interaction of the form, its history, speakers' knowledge of the word and the context of usage. Being able to describe what goes on is more important than the label. 

Classification of anything in linguistics always has to be focused on what you want to achieve. All classifications come from a certain perspective. So there will never be a definitive answer. Having said that, it may be useful to have a bit of a point of reference when reviewing the literature. You must also not confuse classification based on properties intrinsic to the verb or its use with the classification of the actual uses. So e.g. infinitive / finite verb describes the state of the verb, as does the person or tense. Transitive, on the other hand, is an intrinsic property of the verb (or at least one of its senses). You'll find people talk about different classes of verbs in two broad categories: syntactic and semantic (they overlap and interact but it's useful to keep the distinction in mind - no matter how provisionally).

Linguistic determinism is a broader philosophical and psycholinguistic question about the relationship between thought and language. Linguistic relativity is a position that 1. the relationship between linguistic structures and structures of thought (and cognition) is deterministic AND 2. it applies to particular structures of particular languages and their speakers. Namely, different languages cause their speakers to think differently from each other in fundamental ways. The reading list for this issue is quite long. The current proponent of this position is Lera Boroditsky and her publications will provide further references. I always liked Lakoff's summary of the issues in chapter 18 of Women, Fire and Dangerous Things. And the edited volume Rethinking Linguistic Relativity will provide a good overview. One of the most vociferous opponents of relativity is the philosopher Jerry Fodor. Some of the contra arguments and literature can be found here. 

There is no notion of semantics vs. pragmatics. Now, this does not solve the problems of something like machine translation where you still have to find a way of 'understanding' the context. But you can build a semantic model, that makes this approach perfectly plausible. However, it won't look very much like the sort of formal grammars you have in mind. (By the way, constituency and dependency are not 'grammars' per se but rather approaches to syntax. They each cover many 'grammars' that use specific notation and make specific assumptions.) It is also worth pointing out that conversation analysis has identified a number of patterns in language used to disambiguate - so called conversation repair. Ultimately, context is not always enough. So you may get something like: 

This is a question that probably has a quite straightforward answer: historical development. Various European languages adopted the Latin alphabet through different routes and mapped it differently onto their phonological systems. j is a bit of a special case (similarly to 'u' and some others) since in Latin, it did not represent a separate phoneme but was only a graphical variant of i used in certain contexts. So it wasn't until quite late that various languages decided to use it to represent different sounds as the need arose. For instance, German started using j to represent /j/ only in late 15th century. In Czech, for instance, j represented the long vowel /i:/ while /j/ was written as /g/ until the beginning of the 19th century. Wikipedia has more details for other languages: $URL$
