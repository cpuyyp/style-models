The Time lag between the initial naval operations in feb/march and the landings in april telegraphed a probable landing and gave the turks time to reinforce the area. Why didn't the allies use over routes to Russia, I would say the poor state of Russian railways and their overloaded state was a factor (I doubt there was an effective Persian railway in ww1, for that route to be used in ww2 a major upgrade of the works was rehired) 

Palestine was provisionally recognised as a Nation by the League of Nations in the Mandate process (all class A mandates were "provisional" states). Though what this means is pretty debatable, doubly so with the Palestinian Mandate with the insertion of the Balfour Declaration. $URL$ "The first group, or Class A mandates, were territories formerly controlled by the Ottoman Empire that were deemed to "... have reached a stage of development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognized subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the Mandatory." 

The Israel had a number of paramilitary groups which had been training, stockpiling arms long before the 1948 war, many Jews joined the British forces during ww2 to gain military experience. The Zionists had created a shadow army and had stockpiled weapons for a long time before 1948. The Local Arab forces were very disorganised divided and had little weaponry by comparison, and their supporters in other Arab states were reluctant to effectively arm them no lest because they were keen to suppress any possible Palestinian state and annex land the could form that state. The Arab intervention forces were poorly organised and equipped in General and very divided politically. The Arab Legion was pretty well equipped and organised (though not that well supplied with ammunition that had not stockpiled well and the blockade of resupply was much more effective on Arab forces than Zionist forces, who were better able to circumvent the arms embargo during the war and cease fires) Jordan sought to reach an understanding with the Zionist leadership and was primarily focused on annexing much or the proposed Palestinian state rather than attacking the new state of Israel the only real disagreement being Jerusalem. Syrians were involved in a limited land Grab, the Lebanese made a demonstration not an attack, and Iraqi forces were troublemakers shipped off rather than supported army force. The Syrians used extremely dated pre ww2 French tanks of dubious value. The Israeli forces were not fighting well developed and equipped armies. The Arab states were also fairly new, badly equipped with obsolete weapons operating in many cases a long distances from the logistical bases. 

Added 05-25-2017. I have found another alleged Descent from Emperor Louis III to Emperor Henry VII but it also has one or two uncertain identifications. Emperor Louis III (882-928) Son of Ermengarids and Boso. King of Provence 890. King of Italy 990. Crowned Emperor 901. Captured and blinded by Berenger in 905. Louis continued to reign in Provence, but Count Hugh of Arles ruled. Louis was betrothed in 900 to Anna, Daughter of Emperor Leo VI, and perhaps married her. Louis married 902/05 Adelais. $URL$ Charles or Charles Constantine (905/10-962) Count of Vienne. $URL$ Richard (d. 962 or later). Son. Childless?$URL$ Hubert. (died 962 or later) Brother, son of Charles Constantine. Possibly identical with Humbert Count of Belley. In turn Humbert Count of Belley might possibly have been the material uncle of the ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. $URL$ $URL$ Adelais sister of Humbert Count of Belley and thus possible daughter of Charles Constantine. Possible mother of Humbert I Count of Maurienne and Chablis, ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. $URL$ So we will trace the heirs of the Counts of Savoy as possible heirs of the Carolingian emperors. Humbert (970/75-1047/51) Possible descendant of Charles Constantine. Ancestor of Counts of Savoy. Count of Maurienne and Chablis. $URL$ $URL$ Amedee (995/1000?-1051) Son. Amadeus I Count of Maurienne and Chablis. No surviving children. $URL$ Burchard (995/1000?-1068) Younger brother. Archbishop of Lyon. Childless. $URL$ [Odo (1017?-1060) Younger brother. Count of Maurienne and Chablis 1051, Margrave of Susa] $URL$ Count Peter I of Savoy (1047/49-1078) Margrave of Susa. Son. $URL$ Amadeus II Count of Savoy Margrave of Susa. (1048/50-1080) Brother. $URL$ Count Humbert II of Savoy (1072-1103) Son. $URL$ Adelaide (1092?-1154) daughter. Married King Louis VI (1081-1137) the Fat of France.[$URL$ Louis VII (1120-1180) King of France. Son. $URL$ Marie of France (1145-1198) daughter. Married Henry I (1126-1181) Count of champagne.$URL$ Empress Marie (1174?-1204) Daughter. Married future Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople (1171-1205). $URL$ Margaret II (1202-1280) Countess of Flanders and Hainaut. Daughter. Married first Bouchard d'Avesnes (1180?-1244). $URL$ Baldwin of Avesnes (1219-1295) Son. $URL$ Beatrix d'Avenes (d. 1321) daughter. Married Count Henry VI of Luxemburg (1250?-1288) $URL$ Emperor Henry VII (1274-1313) Son. $URL$ See also post number 36 here: $URL$ Bu this all depends on if Hubert son of Charles Constantine is the same person as Humbert Count of Belley and if the sister of Humbert Count of Belley was the mother of Humbert Count of Maurienne and Chablis, ancestor of the Counts of Savoy. Return to original post. It is possible that any descent from any Carolingian, not merely Emperor Louis III, would suffice to satisfy the original question, As you can see by looking at the ancestor chart of Emperor Henry VII, most of his ancestors came from the Benelux countries or neighboring regions of France and Germany. The Counts of Louvain and later the Dukes of Brabant, heirs of the Carolingian Kings of France, intermarried with noble families in that area. $URL$ Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Lombards and "Great Peaceful Emperor Governing the Roman Empire", was the father of Emperor Louis I, whose sons included Charles II the Bald, King of the west Franks (or of France) and Emperor, father of Kin gLouis II the Stammmerer, father of King Charles III the Simple, father of King Louis IV from Overseas, father of (his younger son) Duke Charles (953-991) of Lorraine, rightful heir of France. Duke Charles of Lotharingia/Lorraine was the father of Gerberga (975?-after 1018) who married Lambert I Count of Louvain. $URL$ Gerberga and Lambert I were the parents of Lambert II Count of Louvain. $URL$ Lambert II, Count of Louvain (died 1062) had a son Henry II, Count of Louvain. $URL$ Henry II, Count of Louvain (died c. 1078) had a daughter Ida who married Baldwin II of Hainaut. $URL$ Their children included Baldwin III, Count of Hainaut, father of Baldwin IV, father of Baldwin V. $URL$ Baldwin V was the father of Baldwin VI who became Latin Emperor Baldwin I of Constantinople in 1204. $URL$ Emperor Baldwin's daughter Countess Margaret II was the mother of Baldwin of Avesnes who was the father of Beatrice of Avesnes, the mother of Emperor Henry VII. So I was able to find one of Emperor Henry VII's no doubt many descents from the Carolingians in just a few minutes of online research. Emperor Henry VII was also son of Count Henry VI of Luxemburg, son of Margaret of Bar, daughter of Philippa of Dreux, daughter of Count Robert II of Dreux and Yolanda of Coucy. Yolande of Coucy (died 1222) was the daughter of Raoul of Coucy and Agnes of Hainaut. $URL$ Agnes of Hainaut was the daughter of Baldwin IV, the son of Baldwin III, the son of Baldwin II and Ida of Louvain, one of the children of Count Henry II of Louvain, descendant of the Carolingian kings of France. $URL$ So a few minutes of research finds another descent from the Carolingians. By an interesting coincidence I have recently been investigating a pedigree claiming that Emperor Henry VII and his Luxemburg Dynasty was the heir of the Ottonian Dynasty and the Ottonian Dynasty could be considered the heir of the Carolingian Dynasty. But descended from Emperor Lothaire I's son King Lothaire II of Lotharingia instead of Emperor Louis III. Look for "The Carolingian Legacy" here: $URL$ Posts number 12 and number 14 in this thread in Historum discusses the alleged heirship of Emperor Henry VII. $URL$ In it I conclude that Emperor Henry VII was not the senior heir of the Saffenberg counts, and that I have not yet found any genealogical link between his Saffenberg ancestors and the descendants of Emperor Otto II. It is my opinion that since for almost five hundred years the head of the Hohenzollern Dynasty was the rightful heir of the Kings and Emperors of Emperor Henry VII's Luxemburg Dynasty, some supporter of the Hohenzollerns decided to make their ancestry even better by digging up or inventing genealogical links that made them the allegedly rightful heirs of the earlier Carolingian and Ottonian Dynasties. ............................................................................. 

1) distance - the mongols could only have projected a relatively small amount of power into Europe, yes they could send a horde of mongols, but their allies marching from china is another matter, and their commitments to their heartlands would restrict the amount of power they could project. 2) logistics the mongol hordes required a lot of grass, sustained campaigns were difficult. expansion into western Europe would have all sorts of problems. 3) societal structure, the mongols simply did not have any effective way to command and control a vast empire, any projection would just be an adventurer without real support. returning because a leader dies shows the lack of a real structure for ruling large empires. without the well defined an organised structure the mongol empire ws splitting apart before it was finished being created. 4) the mongols are not quite the invincible force they are often made out, the key factors in the mongol conquest of china was china was divided and the existence of local allies willingly to work with the mongols. conquered china with the help of the mongols themselves. 5) feudal structure of Europe made it pretty resistant to conquest. empires are easy chop of the head and the rest is long used to subservience, with the feudal structure each little lord was independent not used to obeying their own kings and long used to rebellion. 

Italy had a much smaller population, much less resources, (coal, iron ore etc) which meant Italy would have to pay for and import much the materials required to run their industrial economy, much less developed industrial and educationally, and much southern Italy was pretty backward by European standards. That Italy, much smaller population, much smaller resources, much less education, much less developed industrial base and with large backward regions failed to become a major world power is hardly a surprise. 

Oslo was Israel recognising that Palestinians have some rights that the PLO were entitled to negotiate for them, agreeing for the Palestinian Authority to be set up and giving it some autonomy and control over parts of the west bank. The Palestinians recognised Israel and the 1967 borders while agreeing to negotiate a permanent border. Basically both sides signing up to the Two State Solution. Some Israelis did not accept handing over any of the west bank, some Palestinians against recognising Israel. There was a lot of criticism on the Palestinian side that the framework let all the power in the Israeli hands. there were meant to be serious negotiation on permanent issues and further hand overs of areas of the west bank. there is a strong perception that it enabled the creation of butu-stans isolated Palestinian enclaves while Israel continues to expand it's settlements in the west bank. (100,000 before Oslo 350,000 now not counting Jerusalem another 300,000) Both sides had a lot of internal propaganda for years building up a following for no compromise at all. Oslo came out of the blue part of the reason the talks worked is that they were hidden and the wider leadership let alone the publics were unaware of the talks or their substance. the solo agreements were a surprise. there were strong groups on both sides which were opposed. 

Here is an ancester chart for Joachim Murat's son Lucien from wikipedia. $URL$ All Joachim Murat's ancestors up to Pierre Murat seem to have married women with French surnames. Thus the ancestors back for three generations seem to have lived in France. His ancestors farther back could have lived in France or emigrated from some other country, possibly the Ottoman Empire. But I suspect it is just a coincidence that his name sounds Turkish to you. 

Our dating system(s) are not based on astronomical events. They are based on astronomical cycles. Studies over thousands and thousands of years using more and more accurate instruments has refined scientific knowledge of the length of various astronomical cycles such as the day, the month, and the year. Thus calendars are designed to be accurate about the length of natural astronomical cycles. Thus the old Roman calendar was replaced by the Julian Calendar that started on 1 January 45 BC, and the Julian Calendar was replaced by the Gregorian Calendar in which Thursday, 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday, 15 October 1582. In most dating systems the years are numbered from the years of various historical events, not astronomical events. And this is the very briefest of summaries in answer to your question. 

IMHO opinion there were no ethnic Vikings. Scandinavians were ethnic Danes, or Norse, or Swedes. The pagan Scandinavians who sailed to raid and pillage foreign lands were vikings by occupation. Scandinavians who wanted to be vikings and were accepted into viking crews probably had distinctive personalities. Egil's Saga says he killed a boy when he was seven years old and his mother suggested with his violent personality he should be a viking when he got older. ("Son be a viking"?). And Egil did go on viking voyages. And possibly viking crews recruited bigger than average Scandinavians in the belief that would make them better at fighting. In real life the average viking raider might have been significantly bigger than the average native of the lands they raided, but various factors probably made some vikings smaller than usual. 

Harper's Ferry changed hands several times during the US Civil War, each time due to military maneuvers and possibly combat. Some places in the Shenandoah Valley are alleged to have changed hands dozens of times during the US Civil War - Winchester and Front Royale if I remember correctly. Naturally it would take a bit of research to check how many times those places actually changed hands. And more research to see how many times there was at least a skirmish when the place changed hands.
