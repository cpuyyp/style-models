First of all you have misunderstood the meaning of 31 planes of existence. It doesn't mean there are 30 other planets in the universe. This simply suggests that there are 30 other realms that are inhabited other than the human realm in this solar system. Four of the 31 are said to be on earth itself: human, animal, hungry ghost and hell realms. On the other hand Buddha says the universe is so vast that you cannot reach the end of it, 

A sekha is someone who trains himself in higher virtues, training the mind to a higher degree and training for higher wisdom or basically someone who's training himself in the eightfold path. There are 7 types of sekhas (1) the path to stream-entry; (2) the fruition of stream-entry; (3) the path to once-returning; (4) the fruition of once-returning; (5) the path to non-returning; (6) the fruition of non-returning; (7) the path to arahantship 

Conceit doesn't convey the full meaning of 'Māna' in Buddhism. 'Māna' is measuring. You can measure yourself against others in three ways, 

Yes, they do know the kamma that lead them there. In fact, the governer in hell (king Yama) is regarded as a nice person who tries to help them recall any of their past good deeds before throwing them away to torture. If they happen to recall any good action, they'll be turned away to be born again in a higher realm. Such an instance is given in Devaduta sutta where king Yama tries to remind a new entrant of the five deva messengers that instigate people to do good in the human world. There's a nice background story to a Dhammapada verse where king Pasenadi consulted Buddha on hearing some weird sounds at night and this turning out to be four of his former friends now in Lohakumbhi hell trying to convey him a message on consequences of their sexual misconducts. 

So you can't neutralize someone else's bad deeds by your actions. He will eventually reap the results of his actions when all the conditions fall into place. I think it's easy to understand this if we consider kamma as a natural law like gravity. There are four types of kammas with respect to the time of taking effect in abhidhamma. 

Yes it's a Buddhist teaching. Contemplation on a skeleton is called atthika-sanna in Pali. Buddha's teaching of this is in Atthikamahapphala sutta (SN 46.57), however, there's no English translation of this .This technique is commonly used by forest monks to overcome sensual desires. You can practice it with a real skeleton, a picture of it or visualizing a skeleton in mind. 

The Pali version of this expression identifies equanimity that is diversified as upekkhā nānattā nānattasitā and equanimity which is unified as upekkhā ekattā ekattasitā. 

As for other realms, hungry ghosts and devas are also said to recall the kamma that brought them there. Petavatthu and Vimanavatthu provide a number of stories of monks who encountered such beings and heard their stories. 

Yes, meditation is the 'greatest good deed' in Buddhism, specially contemplation on anicca, dukkha, anatta or the meditation types that are conducive to the cessation of suffering i.e. Vipassana. Generosity (dana) and other meritorious acts can be beneficial for a better birth in future lives but they are subject to impermanence. But results gained through meditation - nirvana is not subject to decay. Following is what Buddha said in Velāma Sutta, how heart of good will (metta meditation) is greater than dana, taking refuge or being virtuous and perception on inconstancy (vipassana) is greater than all the other good acts. 

Dr. Ian Stevenson did research on rebirth, and most of his subjects were children. As I remember he said during the first 5-6 years of a child's life some of them would remember how they died. Most of them who remembered their previous life have had some sudden tragic death. Hence, these incidents seem to be deeply carved in their minds, but this memory would slowly fade away as they grew old. Most of these incidents were reported from families having Hindu or Buddhist backgrounds because their parents believed in rebirth and believed their child was saying the truth. In some cases, when the researchers traced the child's past routes based on their stories, they had actually found that the person had existed. Also in some cases it turned out that the parents have been lying to gain some popularity from local media. :) But I think this research is not so popular among other scientists, claiming it has no clear evidence that backs his theories. Upon his death I think his student continues this work. Here's link to their work. $URL$ (Edited the previous reference according to Ven. Yuttadhammo's comment) 

How does a woman stay as a woman? A woman does not escape her femininity as long as she clings to her feminine nature. 

There are four main places that most Buddhists visit at least once in their lifetime. According to Buddha's words in Mahaparinibbana sutta those are Lumbini, Buddhagaya, Sarnath and Kusinara in Nepal and India. 

According to Abhidhamma commentary it seems that the seat of consciousness is in the heart. However, in the suttas Buddha seems to have only mentioned ‘yam rupam nissaya’—depending on that ‘rupa’. 

Later, in 1904 he had split with Henry Steel Olcott as well. The reason given in the book Relics, Ritual, and Representation in Buddhism is, 

After the split I don't think there was enough time for something significant to happen, because Henry Steel Olcott died on 1907. 

In Buddha's time most of them were type 1,2 and 3. So I guess Bāhiya the merchant, Sariputta thero and Moggallana thero fall under the first category. These days unfortunately most people fall under third and fourth categories. 

The author cites Return to Righteousness: A Collection of Speeches, Essays, and Letters of the Anagarika Dharmapala as the original source for this and quotes the following phrase from this book in a footnote, 

Craving for life arises as perceiving the five aggregates as self and this is the highest level of craving. As an example, during a natural disaster someone would first try to save his own life at any cost, then the lives of his loved ones and finally when everyone is safe, he would try to save his possessions. From the given example, satisfying thirst may fall under first type, wanting a car falls under fourth and missing a loved one falls under the third level. Note- The author of the book hasn't referred to any text in Pali canon whether this is a categorization of Buddha or if it appears in Abhidhamma. 

It is in Thupavamsa. I doubt if there's any online version of the translation. The Pali version of Thupavams in the following link says, at the time the people were building the road, Sumedha was supposed to be flying in the sky. When he asked if he could also help, as people already knew that he had iddhi powers they gave him to construct a difficult part of the road. 

AFAIK, monks are not allowed to be away from their monasteries for more than 3 days during the rain season. But a monk I know had to travel out of the country due to some personal matter during this period for more than three days. So I'm curious to know whether there are specific situations in Vinaya where the monks are allowed to break this rule? If so, are they capable of receiving the Kathina robes? 

This first occurred when he met the five ascetics after the enlightenment when they started calling him by his name Gotama before teaching his earliest discourse, Dhammacakkapavattana sutta. 

In Theravada, the criteria for accepting any teaching as authentic is based on Mahapadesa sutta, also found in Mahaparinibbana sutta and Nettipakarana. Accordingly, any Dhamma that's heard as a Buddha's statement must be verified with the suttas and the vinaya. This also indicates that the authority increases from a single monk to a group of monks, and the highest authority is given to the words directly heard from the Buddha. Even so, it must be cross checked with the suttas and vinaya to see if they were interpreted correctly. 

As Marathi calendar is also related to Hindu calendar, there is an obvious relationship between Vesak and the Vaishakh month. 

According to the commentary it seems Buddha's dialect is Pali. But Thanissaro Bhikku argues that epigraphic evidence suggests Pali is not Buddha's dialect. It is said to be the dialect of Ven. Mahinda, king Asoka's son, who came to Sri Lanka. So it must be either Magadhi or Pali which are said to have many similarities. 

I guess it is both. On one hand, Buddha new the weaknesses of each individual and was able to recommend what type of meditation that's suitable for him. He new how much each person's five spiritual faculties were developed and provided the right recommendation. This type of knowledge that a Buddha possesses is called indriya-paro-pariya-ñāṇa. I think this is why some monks practice different kinds of meditation techniques alternatively since there's no Buddha to guide them now. On the other hand, the people during Buddha's time have had perfected paramis onto such an extent that some of them would get enlightened by hearing just one stanza of a sutta. e.g. Bāhiya the merchant, Sariputta thero and Moggallana thero. In Puggalapannatti of abhidhamma pitaka mentions four types of people, 

Being (Bhava), which conditioned by clinging, can be further divided as kammabhava and upapattibhava. Kammabhava is again meritorious, demeritorious, and imperturbable (Jhana) things we do. Here, Kammabhava is a cause for Upapattibhava (different realms) and Birth. 

While this statement points to the omniscience of Buddha, it also shows his confidence that no thing in this world is able to challenge him and his teachings. 

A bodhisatta aspiring to be a pacceka buddha requires 2x10^140 (dve asaṅkhyeyyāni) eons of practice. 

There are many examples in Buddha's life how others were inspired by his appearance. King Bimbisara was tempted to offer him a palace seeing his stature on the first encounter (this was before his enlightenment),
