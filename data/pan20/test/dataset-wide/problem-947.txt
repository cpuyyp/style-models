The linked article talks about irrigated agriculture so I'll focus on that, but things are generally the same for rain-fed agriculture, except you have less control on the water application and there is no loss in getting the rain to where it hits the ground (yes some rain evaporates as it falls but we measure rain at the ground). For irrigation water, though some is lost between the water intake and the field. We don't usually consider evaporation along rivers but when you take water out of a river some evaporates as it flows through canals to where it is used. Some water is also lost through leakage since many canals are just excavated in the soil. Relatively few irrigation water systems are piped but that is one way to make water use more efficient. Lining canals with cement or plastic can help prevent leakage (a number of channels are lined with plastic near where I live but animals like koalas can get trapped as they try to cross). The next place water is lost is in evaporation from the irrigation spray or ground surface. That is usually considered in calculating water use for growing crops. Hot dry weather will increase the loss and for some soils a dry surface can inhibit infiltration of the water. Some water usually ends up back in the streams or wetlands from surface runoff or from returns to the canal systems. Another loss is water that flows through the root zone before plants can use it. That flow can be important in keeping salts from building up to the point where the crop yield declines or plants can't survive. On the other hand it can leach metals from the soil down into the groundwater. As you probably know, plants take up water from their roots and use it in photosynthesis to grow. They also respire at night when there is no photosynthesis. That water is the major part of the water use by the plants - very little is left in the biomass. There are some ways to breed plants or engineer your crop (like pruning trees) to make the plant water use more efficient in terms of how much product yield you get, but these are somewhat limited. And, of course, water is used by weeds. Bottom line, most water in agriculture ends up as evapotranspiration (evaporation from the surface plus transpiration from plants). Some is lost to the groundwater or returned to surface water from the irrigation systems. There are further inefficiencies in meat and dairy production. Some water is lost in metabolism, urine, feces, etc. And animals have to eat a lot of food to put on weight. 

If you are including the early history of the earth, study of regolith from the Archean period has been used to indicate the oxidation state of the atmosphere. Different weathering products form, depending on the amount of oxygen in the air and dissolved in infiltrating rainwater. So the residual soil chemical and isotopic composition changed when the atmosphere became oxic. There are a few locations in South Africa, Canada, and probably other places where these soils were buried and preserved, (e.g. by lava flows near Flin Flon Manitoba Canada). 

If you can't scratch it with a knife, it is most likely agate a form of cryptocrystaline quartz (quarts made up of very fine crystals). 

This is generally true, but like most things in nature, there are exceptions. There is no capacity to hold additional water once soils are saturated to the surface and infiltration is limited by the generally slow rate of groundwater flow. This produces saturation-dependent overland flow and greatly increases runoff. Another effect is that cold conditions reduce vegetation growth, especially annual grasses. The lower groundcover promotes runoff. However, under dry conditions some soil types can become hydrophobic, which also reduces infiltration and increases runoff. This can be due to coating of soil particles with organic substances as can occur in native forests in Australia due to eucalyptus and other oils. I believe this is a bit of an over-simplification because it does not consider the unsaturated flow dynamics that could impede infiltration without organic coatings. 

Just for completeness changes in the groundwater saturation at a location can have a small effect on the gravity. Filling the pores in unsaturated sediments with water due to increased recharge from precipitation, irrigation, etc. increases the bulk density and thus the gravity. 

It appears from your picture that there is some mist above the lake surface. The phenomenon will be due to the same mechanism that causes conventional rainbows. The angles between the sun, the mist/cloud, and the observer will be identical but you will only see this with the sun low in the sky since the mist is near the water. That will also make the rainbow appear to be floating on the water surface (great photo, btw). I think the dark background of the trees helps make the colours more intense. The low sun means that the spectrum can be seen on either side and behind the observer. So you are correct that it will form a triangle around you. If I'm visualizing things properly, in your photo the sun would be to your right - on the violet side of the rainbow. I am not aware of any distinct name for this, possibly because it is not really different from a rainbow from a scientific perspective or because too few scientists are awake at 4 AM. 

Given the hardness and the appearance, I think 1 and 2 are quartzite. Rock 3 may be too. Brief Google search suggests that is generally consistent with the Atlas Mountains. 

Riverbed 'stones' - I assume you mean things like pebbles, boulders, etc. are pieces of rock that have weathered out and been deposited in the river. Some come from rock that is very close to where they are located and some have been transported from very far away. In general (and it is a very broad generalization) the rounder the stone, the longer it has been in the river and the more likely it is to have come from far away. Of course that depends on the hardness of the rock, and other factors, too. Some rocks are newer than others. Some have been formed quite recently and some are billions of years old. 

My suggestion would be to use shade cloth. You can get it in different densities and different colours. I know this is not the same as clouds, but get her to think about what the differences are and how that might affect the results. If I were a judge I would be very impressed to see a section like that on the poster. 

The white areas appear to be formed on the edge of elevated parts of the landscape and in low-lying flat areas. You can see this if you use Google Earth and looking at the elevation profiles along paths you sketch across the landscape. They don't appear to form at a particular elevation or other pattern that would indicate they are bedrock outcrops. I think the most likely possibility is that they are caliche deposits (calcium-carbonate cemented sediments), formed as water ran off of higher elevations, mobilizing calcium and evaporating to cause calcite saturation. They could be halite but I would expect more extensive deposits in the broader drainage areas if they were salt. They could have formed under wetter climate conditions. If you look at 23 degrees 14.053' North, 24 degrees 25.22' East, you can see deposits being covered by sand dunes. 

This does control the cleavage direction but there are other cubic minerals where the ion sizes and charge mean the cleavage is stronger in different directions. A good example is fluorite, calcium fluoride, which often forms cubic-shaped crystals but has octahedral cleavage. 

As noted in the comments the wikipedia articles (at the time this question was submitted) are contradictory. There are quite a few steps to the logic of how argon-argon dating works but none are too complicated, although I won't go into all of the possible interferences. One thing to keep in mind is that high-precision isotope measurements always measure ratios between isotopes, not absolute concentrations. To understand argon-argon dating, you need to understand potassium-argon dating. The isotope potassium-39 makes up about 93% of natural potassium. Potassium-40 is radioactive but has such a long half-life that it is primordial - it has been around since the earth was being formed. Because of this, we can assume that the potassium-40:potassium-39 ratio in minerals at any time is a constant. Potassium-40 decays in 2 different ways. Most decays by beta decay to calcium-40. About 10.7% decays to Argon-40 by emitting a positron. If the argon-40 stays trapped in the crystal and you can measure the ratio of potassium-40 to argon-40, then you know how long it has been since the mineral formed. This also assumes that there is no other source of argon like trapped air. A problem is that it takes two separate measurements to get the potassium concentration and the argon isotope ratios, increasing the uncertainty. Argon-argon dating gets around many of the issues by measuring only multiple isotopes of argon. The trick is to irradiate the sample with neutrons along with samples of known age. Some of the potassium-39 forms argon-39 by an n,p reaction. By converting potassium-39 to argon-39 then measuring the argon-39:argon-40 ratio, you can calculate the sample's potassium-40:argon-40 ratio, remembering potassium-40:potassium-39 is fixed. The standards of known age are used to account for differences in the neutron flux during irradiation. Argon-36 in the sample accounts for any air contamination. Argon-argon dating, ideally assumes that: 

This question (and my answer) borders on opinion but is a good example of the interface between the science and policy. Forests and tree plantations are a sink for carbon but that sink is a one-off credit because trees die and decay, cycling the carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. So growing new trees will tie up additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but maintaining existing mature forests will be carbon neutral. Harvesting existing forests without reforestation can increase atmospheric carbon dioxide if the wood is burned or allowed to decay. If the paper and wood products are sequestered from decay or if the decay is significantly slower than the existing cycle, then atmospheric carbon sequestration will increase if the forest is allowed to regrow and the forest sink is maintained. So the original supposition is basically correct provided it doesn't lead to increased deforestation. There are some additional considerations that would have to be addressed by a life-cycle analysis of the paper industry. Does it take more fossil fuel to make paper from harvested trees or from collecting, sorting, transporting, and reprocessing paper? That could tip the balance one way or another. In addition, the non-carbon value of the forests should be considered. Will the forestry cause excessive environmental harm through habitat shifts, road building, increased stream sedimentation during harvest, etc?
