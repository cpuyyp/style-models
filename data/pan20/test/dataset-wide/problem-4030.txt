A manifold supports a so-called orientation sheaf, which unfortunately I cannot recall how to define except to say it is the sheaf of sections of the orientable double cover of the manifold. I vaguely recall that this may be discussed in Dold's book on algebraic topology. An orientation is then a global section of the orientation sheaf. As the orientable double cover has fibres isomorphic to a two element set, there are at most two orientations. 

In answer to the 'pre-question', yes, pretty much correct. I would just add that the cover $(U_i)$ in X in your second paragraph is a cover of the terminal object in the site $X$, if it has one. If not, then I think it's a bit fiddlier. Joyal and Tierney showed that every topos is the topos of sheaves on a localic groupoid (a groupoid internal to the category of locales) and this groupoid is basically the fundamental groupoid of that topos. If one assumes successively stronger conditions about the topos, then this groupoid becomes more like the more familiar notions. If the topos has a point (not all do!) then one can talk about the fundamental group (which is in full generality, localic). Then if the topos is locally connected, it gets nicer. Marta Bunge has done a lot of work on this, with various people. As far as connecting with other notions, I'll let the algebraic geometers answer that. 

Consider the odd-dimensional sphere $S^{2n+1} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. One may talk variously about its structure as a contact, CR or Einstein-Sasaki manifold, but I'm looking for some specific down-to-earth detail that is hard to track down, namely charts that are complements of points and which are 'unitary' in the following sense. The tangent space to $S^{n+1}$ at a point $x$ has a subspace isomorphic to the hermitian complement to the complex span of $x$. These patch together to give a complex vector bundle on the sphere -- and I'm fairly sure this is the holomorphic tangent bundle $HS^{2n+1}$ in the CR setting. Taking for $U$ the standard complement of the south pole, there is an isomorphism (even a CR isomorphism!) $\phi\colon Heis_n\simeq U$, where $Heis_n$ is the Heisenberg group, diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}^n\times\mathbb{R}$. Hence we can consider the induced isomorphism $H\, Heis_n \to HU$ and ask whether it is unitary with respect to the standard hermitian structure on the left, and the one induced from $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ on the right. This is all controlled by the isomorphism $\phi$, and if I'm not mistaken in my calculations, taking standard stereographic projection rewritten in complex coordinates doesn't do the trick (which is, making the relevant adjustments, only orthogonal). 

ADDED 27 April 2016: The paper Differentiable stratified groupoids and a de Rham theorem for inertia spaces (arXiv:1511.00371) shows that the intertia groupoid of a Lie groupoid is at least a nicely-behaved stratified space, if not a manifold. For me at least, this is a reasonable conclusion to what the above question was asking, since from this one can then think about what the space of $k$-sectors looks like. Without more information about the groupoid one is interested in I don't believe one can say much more than this. 

I would say have a look at Duskin's paper '$K(\pi,n)$-torsors and the interpretation of "triple" cohomology' (pdf) and his student Glenn's paper 'Realization of cohomology classes in arbitrary exact categories' J. Pure Appl. Algebra, vol. 25, (1982) pp. 33-105. Also Duskin's 'Higher dimensional torsors and the cohomology of topoi : The abelian theory' Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Volume 753 (1979), pp255-279. I'm afraid you have to move beyond just working with schemes to simplicial schemes and what-not. 

For another example, the pretopologies on the category of finite dimensional smooth manifolds given by 

The Initiality Conjecture for MLTT is something that the type theory community expected to be true, based on proofs for much more restricted type theories, but the details of even those were incredibly fearsome. Thomas Streicher wrote a ~300 page book to prove the case of the Calculus of Constructions, a weak subset of the underlying type theory of Coq. VV's work on mathematising the abstract structure of type theories, so they can be studied and worked with in a proof assistant, was a large part of what he was doing in the last few years. His papers on B- and C-systems [1] were extending work by, for example, Cartmell and others on the type of structure a syntactic category has. Moreover I believe that formal proofs were given for all results in those papers. Here's a quote by Peter LeFanu Lumsdaine, responding to a criticism by VV of the attitude that "everyone knows the IC is true...": 

The error is that Rokhlin claimed that $\pi_6(S^3)=\mathbb{Z}/6$, but Hilton, in his review, points out that the paper instead shows that $\pi_6(S^3)/\pi_5(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}/6$. The error lies in a prior calculation (reviewed here) that Rokhlin claimed showed $\eta^3=0$, but in fact this element is 2-torsion. Rokhlin corrects his mistake and calculates the stable homotopy group $\pi_3^s$ in 

Edit: There is also the axiom WISC${}_\kappa$, where we require the set $I_X$ to be bounded by some cardinal $\kappa$ (either less than or at most). This is perhaps more interesting than the unbounded case, especially in topological applications. 

Not especially sophisticated, but there is the note by Tuck: When does the first derivative exceed the geometric mean of a function and its second derivative?. This is studied some more in 

Perhaps one of the biggest ideas that VV was pursuing is the Initiality Conjecture for Martin-LÃ¶f type theory (with universes). A rough idea is that from the rules for a type theory, one can define a category (the syntactic category) that has certain structure depending on which rules are admitted to the type theory. For instance, dependent products correspond to being locally cartesian closed. For any specific type theory, the idea is that the syntactic category it gives rise to is the initial category with that specific structure, in the sense there is a unique functor (preserving appropriate structure) from it to any other such category. What this means is that if one proves a theorem using the type theory, it is automatically true in all categories with that structure. And, vice versa, if it is provable in the language of that kind of structured category, then it is provable in the type theory. Also, to quote from VV: 

all generate the same topology. The last three are nested, and the second is cofinal in the other two. The second and the first are equivalent because of superextensivity. If you are willing to weaken the concept of pretopology to that of coverage then the coverage of (EDIT: coproducts of) smooth good open covers on manifolds also generates the same topology. 

OK, I see what you mean now. How about this: take a complex Lie group $G$ which acts by symplectomorphisms on a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. Then there is a Lie groupoid $M \times G \rightrightarrows M$ - the action groupoid - which actually lifts to be internal to generalised complex manifolds, if (edit:because) the product of a complex manifold and a symplectic manifold is a generalised complex manifold. (Thanks to Marco G for confirming this last fact) 

The thing that Simon gives in his first comment is just a prestack, it needs to be stackified. You can do this by letting $\mathbb{G}(S)$ be the groupoid of principal $\mathcal{G}$-bundles in $\Gamma Set$, in other words, $\Gamma$-equivariant $\mathcal{G}$-bundles in Set. In more detail, I'm assuming you are considering the topology on $\Gamma Set$ to be the one where a covering family is a surjective map. Then we define a principal $\mathcal{G}$-bundle over a $\Gamma$-set $S$ to be a surjective map of $\Gamma$-sets (all maps from now on will be $\Gamma$-equivariant), $\pi\colon P\to S$, a map $b\colon P\to X$ and an action map $a\colon P\times_{X,s} A \to P$ such that $\pi(a(p,f)) = \pi(p)$ (the action is fibrewise); in addition, we demand that the map $P\times_X A \to P\times_S P$ is an isomorphism. Additionally, we demand there is a cover $j\colon T\to S$ and a map $\sigma\colon T \to P$ such that the pulled back bundle $T\times_S P \to T$ is isomorphic to the pullback of the canonical $\mathcal{G}$-bundle $ t\colon A \to X$ (the action is by composition in the groupoid) along $b\circ \sigma\colon T \to P \to X$ The groupoid $\mathbb{G}(S)$ is that of principal $\Gamma$-bundles with bundle maps between them (they preserve fibres and actions, including the data of the map to $X$). The functor $\mathbb{G}(S) \to \mathbb{G}(T)$ is given by pullback. 

For purposes of my own, I'm interested in constructing connected spaces, without recourse to geometric realisation or the like, that have non-trivial homotopy groups in dimension 1 and 2 and are not products of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. This rules out obvious constructions using crossed modules (at least, obvious to me). One idea is this: take a representation $\rho:\Gamma_g \to SO(3)$ of $\Gamma_g = \pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, the fundamental group of a compact, connected, orientable surface or genus $g$. Then form the associated sphere bundle $X=\widetilde{\Sigma_g} \times_\rho S^2 \to \Sigma_g$. Then, unless my calculation is wrong, $X$ is a 2-type space with $\pi_2(X) = \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi_1(X) = \Gamma_g$ and $k$-invariant $a\in H^3(\Gamma_g,\mathbb{Z})$. So my question is, 

Left and right is mostly just a matter of convention: a left action by $G$ is precisely the same as a right action by the opposite group: the same object but with the multiplication in the reverse order. In relation to you last question, you might want to consider the additional left action on the bundle, in a compatible way (acting left then right should be the same as acting right then left). This object is called a principal bibundle if the left action is also principal. These objects come up in two areas that I am aware of. They are used when defining non-abelian bundle gerbes, which are geometric objects representing classes in nonabelian cohomology $H^2(X,AUT(G))$ (here $AUT(G)$ is a coefficient object determined from a group $G$ - it is technically a 2-group or equivalently a crossed module). The other place they turn up is via generalisation when $G$ is replaced by a (topological) groupoid (or Lie groupoid, if you are in a smooth setting), and you can in fact have two different groupoids, one acting on the left, and one acting on the right. These right principal bibundles (drop the principality of the left action here) are then generalised morphisms between topological/Lie groupoids which are used when presenting stacks by groupoids, especially in the Lie groupoid literature. 

That being said, it depends what you want to use double categories for. I'm guessing when you say 'internal to a model category' you mean the canonical model structure on $Cat$, where weak equivalences are categorical equivalences. In that case you propose for weak equivalences those double functors $F\colon C\to D$ which are essentially surjective on objects (which means that one has an epimorphism $C_0 \times_{D_0} D_1 \to D_1 \to D_0$ of categories, not a very good notion) and such that $C_1 \to C_0^2 \times_{D_0^2} D_1$ is an equivalence of categories in the slice $Cat/C_0^2$. This may or may not be what you want. I can think of other options, such as those double functors whose associated map of diagonals of bisimplicial sets is a weak equivalence in some sense (such as in the Quillen model structure), but this is a very homotopical notion, not an algebraic one. Alternatively, one could ask that the map on objects $C_{00} \to D_{00}$ is essentially surjective both horizontally and vertically, the functors of horizontal and vertical categories are fully faithful, and the map on squares $C_{11} \to D_{11}$ in fully faithful in the sense that for $S\in C_{11}$, $S \mapsto (s_v(S),t_v(S),s_h(S),t_h(S);F(S))$ is a bijection. What you use also depends on whether the horizontal and vertical categories are afforded equal status, or one is privileged over the other. 

I think the functors $R,R_n$ preserve products, as do the skeleton functors, so showing that dimension is additive should be ok. 

Edit: For $BSpin(3) = BSU(2)$ the analogous $k$-invariant is given by the map $$ K(\mathbb{Z},4) \to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,4) \xrightarrow{Sq^2} K(\mathbb{Z}/2,6) $$ 

Not necessarily. In the higher category-theoretic setting one asks for a 'contractible space' of choices (space might mean simplicial set or n-category) instead of uniqueness. The natural 2-category one might define may not be the 'right' one to get such a collection of choices, and so one could define a 2-category such that these things are unique in the appropriate sense, but this might just be cooked up to give that result and not of intrinsic interest. For example, one can define the 2-category of fields where the underlying 1-category is $Fields$, and there is a unique 2-arrow between any two parallel 1-arrows. This is clearly not an interesting 2-category. (Other examples of non-unique closures are given here: $URL$ 

Try PNAS papers in section Mathematics (returns 2308 results, but some are cross-discipinary). In the early days there were a lot of pure mathematics papers listed under just 'Mathematics' (e.g. Hardy-Littlewood!). But these days they seem to be listed under Mathematics and Physical Sciences, for instance Morrison-Walker, Griffin-Ono-Rolen and Conway-Jiao-Torquato (actually Ken Ono seems to have published a bunch of stuff there...). This search however picks up a lot of stuff that you wanted to rule out, "use of (sophisticated) mathematical techniques to solve a scientific problem from another discipline." 

I'm interesting in subcategories that are defined by placing conditions on the source and target maps, like smoothness, flatness, tamely ramified or anything. Results that pertain to stacks are especially welcome. 

If it's easier to specify what is only in the ATLAS then that would be good, since clearly a lot of the classical material would be known and calculated long before. 

Addendum Having thought about this a bit more, it seems like I could be addressing this from a sheaf of rings point of view (a case of interest to me is $G=\mathbb{Z}$, or one could take the abelian group underlying a ring). In this case, we consider sheaves of ideals instead of subgroups, and look at the supports of the quotient sheaves. If they are disjoint then they satisfy a relation similar to the one defined above. Put this way, it seems like something quite natural arising from algebraic geometry. 

I have to do some messy calculations with weak 2-functors between bicategories, and I know the most efficient way to do it would be via some sort of string diagram methods. Also, it means that I can put pretty calculations in my paper, unlike some of this paper's 'ancestors' (written by others) where they simply can't put in all the diagrams. To me this seems to be a blow to the reader, because not only does the reader have to figure out what on earth is going on, they are stuck with inelegant methods for doing so. I know exactly what I should be doing if I was working in a single bicategory (just a simple extension of string diagrams for monoidal categories) but I don't know if anyone has written out a version with weak 2-functors. I'm sure someone has. Any pointers? 

I asked Finnur Larusson (one of Forstneric's collaborators) and I was told that $\mathbb{C}^2$ is impossible for the hyperbolic disk as you ask. However I didn't get a positive answer, with Larusson being a bit sceptical about the possibility, but he pointed to the following paper as indicating that an approximate embedding is possible for large $n$: 

Postscript: Joyal defined (in work decades old by not yet published) a special sort of category called an arithmetic universe, which is much weaker than a topos, yet has enough structure to define the free internal arithmetic universe in it. I guess the free internal topos should be exist in a topos, but otherwise I can't be sure it's possible. I worry about erroneously "proving the existence of a model" out of nothing.
