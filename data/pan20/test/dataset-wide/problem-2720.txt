This is your faulty assumption. It does apear pretty quickly. In most cases. But not at all every time. There are in some sense two layers of likelyhood: In layer one, every single event has the very same probability as its precedessors. In layer two, the sequence of events as a whole has a probability to occur. And there are (finite!) sequences, although every single event is equally probable, that are as a whole unprobable. Only with infinite length every sequence is equally possible. The problem is that you never know in "what" sequence you are, it may retrospectavely be the most unlikely sequence possible. That is why, looking to the future, only the probability of the single next event is what counts for the gambler, not the probability for the completed series. You have to to see what the event (and object of probability) is. In the coin-example, the series so far is an event that has occured. So there was a probability for this series to occur before, but now as it has happened it is only a frequency of occurence left. The only probability is that of the next event, because it lies in the future, or of the upcoming series. But as soon as the next toss is made, there is only the probability of the now next event and the now following possible series. Probability can only be expressed for future events! As a sidenote the following "counter-example": Consider three doors, you choose one that has the "probability" of containing the prize of 1/3. Now one door is opened and you have the choice to change the chosen door. What are the chances? Well, you should definately change, because your door now has the "probability" of 1/3 as before, but the other has 2/3. Here you have to consider the whole series, there is no contradiction. That is because there is no probability anymore: The prize already is behind one door, the event has happened. That is the difference. TL;DR: Edit and Conclusion So the fallacy, as expressed by @wedstrom in his comment, is to think that nature will correct itself, will let it happen that the series in progress will converge quickly. But nature is not an actor that does anything. And in the present, there is only past (occured events, frequency) and future (upcoming events, probability). And if the probability is independent, this has to be taken literally as independence from anything that happened in the past, no matter how scarce the occurence of the resulting series will be. 

Available here, no. 153 Considering this every description must be used and is useful in philosophy, may it be scientific or not. 

To give a terribly unphilosophical answer informed rather by economics: As purely mathematical and for wealth distribution only (as per OP) the Gini coefficient and normally nothing else, really. It is the most popular inequality index. 

Adding Allen W. Wood into this illustrious circle (see quotes by him later on) that makes three of the most prolific Kant scholars in history agreeing in that it is his most important piece of writing on ethics for various reasons. This answer will provide three different general reasons (the first one kind of including/following from the other two) for its popularity in addition to the above quotes and after that, a short remark on why this may be understandable, but in fact is quite problematic. 1. It is part of almost every curriculum in academic philosophy One factor definitely is that it is the book of Kant that is lectured on the most in universities. But why is that the case (other than what Paton and Allison wrote and I already mentioned)? It has a length allowing for being read and discussed quite thoroughly in one term and at the same time has quite an elaborate, stringent argument going through all of the text. It is both systematic (something the essays and Metaphysics of Morals lack) and with examples (other than the completely theoretical Critique of Practical Reason). All of them are good reasons to read the Groundwork. Allen Wood offers another very good reason why it's read in academia in the introduction to his Yale translation (2002): 

So knowledge is not only holding something to be true as phenomenal fact, but also subjectively sufficient, that means the judgement is validly grounded on objective grounds (rational) from my standpoint as well as, the way I read it, every other rational being coming to the same judgement because my standpoint is true, which together with valid judgement makes certainty. From that, it is linked to JTB, including the aspects, but a bit different as I take it, too. A further point is that of the following paragraph: 

In both cases (Kant as well, but it would take too much place to consider that here) the idea is that in order to perceive something as a particular object/event at all, we must have a difference, an assymetry in space-time, the other. That is our mode of perception, therefore an underlying, necessary principle of (our!) reality. And as both Kant and Wittgenstein point out here, neither time nor space are absolutely objective, just as this "law" is not. In this sense, it is a principle of the human mode of perception and thought. And therefore very fundamental for each empirical law. 

An all-powerful God will take away all the meaning of freedom, because only he would be free in the full sense in letting us make our choices. And that surely brings a philosopher of the absurd to state that the notion of an omnipotent God is absurd, because it is metaphysical "knowledge" that will not make any difference in our practice. That said, Camus himself surely adds a moral dimension by saying "God the all-powerful is responsible for all evil". That leads to the old problem that scholastic tradition takes God to be good and omnipotent by definition. Both is meant to lie in the notion of God. But this is another paradox, as you correctly stated. 

=> Theoretical predictions first, high-energy experiments following (at least for the 20th century, I'm not sure about Rutherford and others) 

Thus, the answer would simply be that because the orders were not morally justifiable, the regime had no political legitimacy in wielding political power. Hence, he was not obliged to follow the orders, both in the political and moral sense. This becomes even more obvious when we look at the definition of political authority: 

The following is purely based on the citation you made. I think one has to differ two senses of what it means to have a reason: 

There is also a formal reason: Kant uses the Hobbesian criterion from De Cive that "[the citizen] serves no one other than the commonwealth". As again Maliks writes: 

That means that when you are a peasant and can factually not do something morally good because it is not in your power to do so, you are still moral as long as you do everything that is in your power. And when you have the factual power to do good in the world and do not act with good will, i.e. e.g. respecting the dignity of every rational being (see Groundwork, 4:429-433), your are in fact immoral. Peasants have rationality and therefore dignity, animals may have it, but it is hard to tell. He himself, in the spirit of his time, adapts the juridical view that animals in practical affairs are to be treated as things. Only exception being in the Metaphysics of Morals, where he argues that being cruel towards animals dulls your ability to be empathetic, which is something that you cannot rationally want, hence it is immoral (6:443; Part 2 ยง17). And making it categorically immoral to let animals suffer is surely ahead of his time. PS: If you want to learn more about the political implications of the categorical imperative, I suggest reading his Towards Perpetual Peace, where he explicitly writes e.g. that there is a need of republican constitution that guarantees the freedom of all individuals (8:349-50). He writes about how to use political power in a moral way, too: He distinguishes between a political moralist, arguing that whatever he does is right as mean to a certain end (i.e. what he likes to do), and a moral politician, using the categorical imperative as a minimum standard of political action and doing what is right, not what he likes to (8:377-8). 

Definition: A:=B, I define that every time B is the case, it is the case that A. unicorn:=a white, horned horse bachelor:=unmarried man ... I would say that the questioner used another use of "definition" in his statement about colors: Instead of using it in a narrow sense, it is used in a very broad sense, because as I take it, he says "You are just defining a predicate to these curves in addition to the very being of the curves." Color is not inherent to the curves, therefore it has to be assigned to them. Assignments are in some sense definitions, because as they become part of the definition of the occurence of a thing. But not of the thing itself, because it is some kind of weird to say that the curve would not be the same curve if it was not green.
