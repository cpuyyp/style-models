For example, the irreducible differential equation $F(w',w)=0$, where $F$ is a polynomial can have meromorphic solutions only when $F(x,y)=0$ is of genus $0$ or $1$, and all solutions are either rational of trigonometric or elliptic functions (Weierstrass theorem). 

If $f$ is a polynomial, then $C^1$ solution is the same as analytic solution. For analytic solutions, very similar questions are considered in the paper MR1011182 Denef, J., Lipshitz, L. Decision problems for differential equations. J. Symbolic Logic 54 (1989), no. 3, 941–950, which also contains a survey of earlier results. I suppose that one can conclude from this paper, and the results cited in it, that the question is undecidable. They also mention some cases when it is decidable. 

People have difficulties with Boutroux asymptotics not only because his French:-) And the matter is too complicated to be explained in the space allowed for answers in this site. You may look at the papers of Kruskal and Joshi, MR0948427 Joshi, Nalini; Kruskal, Martin D. An asymptotic approach to the connection problem for the first and the second Painlevé equations. Phys. Lett. A 130 (1988), no. 3, 129–137. And also this MR1160153. Here is a recent survey: MR2140299 Steinmetz, Norbert Global properties of the Painlevé transcendents: new results and open questions. Ann. Acad. Sci. Fenn. Math. 30 (2005), no. 1, 71–98. (There is some disagreement on what is really proved and what is not, concerning these Boutroux asymptotics. Many results belong to physicists and their standards of rigor are different). 

My advise: cite everything which you do not prove in your paper, and which is not included in the standard undergraduate and graduate textbooks in the subject. It absolutely does not matter whether the source passed a peer review or not. The crucial criterion for a citable source is that it must be AVAILABLE. (Published, posted in the internet). If you suspect that the thing is in EGA, search in EGA. (I suppose that EGA is not a standard graduate text book, otherwise you would have no difficulty searching:-) What is "common knowledge" and what is not strongly depends on the set of people that you consider. If you want your paper to be read by people, try to make it accessible to maximally broad set. On my opinion, a typical reader of a research paper is a graduate student in the same broad area. 

No, such functions do not exist. Let $u=\log|f|$. Your condition implies that $u(x)\leq O(|x|^\rho)$, where $0\leq \rho<1$, so the Poisson integral of $u^+$ is convergent, and one can obtain the formula $$u(z)=\frac{y}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^\infty u(t)\frac{dt}{(t-x)^2+y^2}\quad\quad +ky+\log|B(z )|,$$ where $z=x+iy$, and $B$ is a Blaschke product for the upper half-plane. See, for example, theorems 7 and 5 in Levin, Distribution of zeros of entire functions, Chap V, sect 3. (Such functions are called of class $A$ in Levin's books, and of Cartwright's class in other books. It is a rather deep result of Cartwright that convergence of the poinsson integral of $u^+$ implies in this case the convergence of the Poisson integral of $u$). Now the condition that $f$ is of zero type implies that $k=0$. (See Thm 6 in the same book, same chapter). Then $u$ is estimated from above by the Poisson integral since $\log|B|\leq 0$. Inserting to the Poisoon integral $|x|^\rho$ instead of $u(x)$, we obtain an upper estimate for $u$. This estimate involvs an integral which can be computed, and computation shows that $u$ must be of order $\rho<1$. So it cannot be of order $1$, minimal type. On your other question (explicit examples of functions of order $1$ and type zero), of course the simplest answer is an infinite product, take zeros at the points $\pm [r\log r]$, for example, where $[.]$ is the integer part. If you don't like products then you can construst examples with explicit power series. Take the coefficients $a_n=n^{-n}(\log n)^{-n}$. Hope this is explicit enough. EDIT. Here is another way to construct a function of minimal type order $1$. Functions $f$ of at most minimal type order 1 have the following description $$f(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\; {\mathrm{res}}_{\zeta=0} F(1/\zeta)e^{z\zeta},$$ where $F$ is an arbitrary entire function with the property $F(0)=0$. This is called Leau's theorem (19 century). Now if you want $f$ to be exactly of order $1$ (not "at most"), take $F$ of infinite order. For example $F(z)=\exp(\exp(z))$. So you have an explicit formula involving an integral. 

Here is another problem on equilibrium points of potentials: suppose that we have infinitely many point masses in $R^3$ (the points do not accumulate). Must there exist a point where the gravitational force created by these masses is zero? If the masses $m_k>0$ are placed at $x_k\to\infty$ then the force is $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty m_k\frac{x-x_k}{|x-x_k|^3},\quad \mbox{where}\quad\sum_{k=1}^\infty m_k|x_k|^{-2}<\infty.$$ Does every such function have a zero? This is a version of the problem proposed by Lee Rubel in 1980-th. For some partial results see $URL$ This question can be easily modified for any dimension $n\geq2$, using Newtonian ($n\geq 3$) or logarithmic potential ($n=2$). The question is substantially easier in dimension $2$, but even for $n=2$ it is not solved in full generality. 

EDIT. My conjecture in 2 is certainly wrong: according to the theorem of T. Simon (second reference in the question text), all positive stable densities are bell-shaped, but they are not Polya frequency functions. 

There is also the book of F. Klein, Development of Mathematics in XIX century, vol. I, which has a large chapter on Gauss which describes his work on modular forms. This was written in XX century, but Klein was essentially a XIX century mathematician, so you can see from this book "how did they think". 

The very difficult proof is based on advanced probability theory. When $n=2$ there is a relatively simple analytic proof. It is also not hard to obtain such result with $3$ replaced by $12$, where $12$ does not depend on dimension:-) Tsirelson writes: 

You were talking about proofs of irrationality. However pi and e are known to be transcendental, and the proof of transcendence is usually harder than a proof of irrationality. Differential equations is indeed a useful tool in proving transcendence. Look at any book which has transcendental numbers in its title. The key authors are Baker, Mahler, Shidlovski, Gelfond and Siegel. However, if we are talking about the proofs of IRRATIONALITY (that is of numbers which were not known to be irrational), here is a famous and relatively simple proof: Apéry, Roger Irrationalité de $\zeta(2)$ et $\zeta(3)$. Astérisque 61, 11-13 (1979). Then you can look at the papers which cite this great result. 

This space has no name (no that I know), and it is probably invented by Stein and Shakarchi for some pedagogical purpose, or for convenience of exposition. As Serge says it is not contained in the Schwartz space $S$ (of test functions). Neither it contains the Schwartz space $S$. It is contained in the space of Schwartz distributions $S^\prime$ but probably the authors did not want to introduce distributions in the elementary Complex Analysis textbook. As it contains all examples they want to consider in this book, they introduced it. There are several other spaces where Fourier transform can be defined, and even the image can be explicitly described, for example, $L^2$, or more general distributions than Schwartz, but I agree with Bazin that Schwartz distributions is perhaps the most useful class. In an elementary textbook, one has to begin with something, so they invented this artificial class. In the later volumes of the course they address $L^2$ and Schwartz distributions. 

It seems easy to obtain a negative answer by simple experiment. Make this cylinder of paper. Then squeeze one base with your fingers (leaving another base free). Both bases cannot remain planar: indeed the lines $\theta=\mathrm{const}, z\in[0,1]$ in the original non-squeezed position were all of the same length $1$. And they were perpendicular to both base planes. In the squeezed position, their lengths must be still $1$ but they are not all perpendicular to any plane anymore, so both bases cannot remain planar. 

A famous example of a "false illusion" is Hilbert Problem 2: to prove that axioms of arithmetic are consistent. Hilbert even did not care to state this as a question: are they consistent or not, so much he was sure that this can be proved. 

Riemannian metrics are intrinsic. This means that for every $x,y$ and every $t, 0<t<d(x,y)$ there exists $z$ such that $d(x,z)+d(z,y)=d(x,y)$. For example the standard spherical metric is intrinsic, while the chordal metric is not and thus cannot be approximated by a Riemannian metric. Intrinsic metrics satisfying certain condition, too complicated to be stated here, can be approximated by Riemannian metrics in the same conformal class. This is a result of Reshetnyak published only in Russian in 1960. But here is his detailed survey in English: Yu. G. Reshetnyak, "Two-dimensional manifolds of bounded curvature”, 3–163, 245–250, in the book: Geometry. IV. Nonregular Riemannian geometry. A translation of Geometry, 4 (Russian), Akad. Nauk SSSR, Vsesoyuz. Inst. Nauchn. i Tekhn. Inform., Moscow, 1989 [MR1099201]. Translation by E. Primrose. Encyclopaedia of Mathematical Sciences, 70. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993. vi+250 pp. ISBN: 3-540-54701-0 EDIT. If the metric is not intrinsic, or intrinsic and does not satisfy the Aleksandrov-Reshetnyak's condition, then what is the conformal class? 

The answer to Question 3 is yes, and to Questions 1,2 the answer is "no", unless the initial conditions are very special. To address these questions, assume wlog that $T=2\pi$, and expand everything into Fourier series. Let $a_n, b_n$ be coefficients of $r_1,r_2$, and $s_n$ coefficients of $s$. Let $D_i=P_i(D)$, where $D=d/dx$. Let $c_{i,n}=P_i(n\sqrt{-1})$. The quantity minimized is the sum of the squares of $L^2$ norms over $(0,T)$. Let us address Question 3 first (no initial conditions). Then a simple computation shows that there is a minimum and its Fourier coefficients are $$s_n=\frac{a_nc_{1,n}+b_nc_{2,n}}{c_{1,n}^2+c_{2,n}^2}.$$ (Substitute the Fourier series, use Parseval, and solve the simple quadratic minimization problem). This solution is unique if $P_i$ have no common root (so the denominator is never $0$). If they have a common root, an exponential polynomial can be added to $s$ without affecting the minimum. This gives a periodic solution. Well, we solved the problem on the interval $(0,T)$ and ANY function can be extended periodically. But one wants the extention to be smooth enough, so that operators $D_i$ make sense. The solution formula shows that the solution is in general has roughly $1$ more derivative in comparison with $r_i$. So if the $r_i$ are smooth enough than $s$ is smooth and periodic with the same period. If we solve the same problem (without initial conditions) on an interval $(0,mT)$, but the $r_i$ still have period $T$, then the formula shows that the solution is the same (has period $T$) unless we are in the unlikely situation when the $P_i$ have a common root. But even in this situation, there always exists a solution with period $T$. Now what happens when we add the initial condition (Questions 1,2). These conditions add a linear restriction on the $s_j$, so when we optimize on $(0,mT)$, in general harmonics $\exp(in/m)$ will be present. And of course their contribution cannot tend to $0$ when $x\to\infty$ because they are periodic. 

Rational number 1/4 occurs as a universal constant in several problems of Analysis. The most famous is the "Koebe 1/4 Theorem". Let $f(z)=z+\ldots$ be an injective holomorphic function in the unit disk. Then the image contains a disk $|z|\geq c$ where $c$ is an absolute constant. This was discovered by Koebe, and for some time the optimal value was even called the "Koebe constant". The optimal (greatest for which this is true) constant was later proved to be $1/4$. An apparently unrelated subject. The family $\phi_n(x)=e^{inx}$ is a Riesz basis in the space $L^2(-\pi,\pi)$. For a sequence of real numbers $\Lambda=\lambda_n$, consider the family $e^{i\lambda_nx}$. If $|\lambda_n-n|<c$, and $c$ is sufficiently small, this is also a Riesz basis. (This is due to Golovin, I guess). This was known for some time before M. Kadets proved that the optimal (greatest) $c$ for which this is true is $1/4$. This remarkable result is called the "Kadets 1/4 theorem". A priori reasons why these two numbers should be rational are not clear. Both numbers are defined as solutions of sophisticated extremal problems, so it was totally unclear why they should be rational until these extremal problems were solved. EDIT. There are also conjectured extremal problems with a rational answer. One is mentioned in the comment of Noam Elkies below. Another is a conjecture of Carleson and Jones, where (surprise!) the extremal constant is also 1/4, or 3/4, depending on notation, but I was never able to understand the reasons why they made such a conjecture: MR1162188. They say it is suggested by numerical computation but the details of this computation were never published. 

Suppose that we have two simple closed curves in $R^3$ which are linked. And suppose that the distance between these curves is $1$. Prove that the length of each curve is at least $2\pi$. This problem has an interesting history. It was published in the book by W. Hayman, Unsolved problems in Function theory, where it was attributed to F. Gehring. I solved it in 1977, jointly with Oleg Vinkovski, prepared a paper and gave a seminar talk. After the talk, I was approached by an undergraduate student, who proposed a ridiculously simple solution. Just two lines, using nothing. So I did not submit my paper. Later I've seen several published solutions, but none of them was so simple. EDIT. Here is this proof (due to Igor Syutrik). Fix a point $M$ on $A$. Then one can find another point $M'$ on $A$ such that the interval $[M,M']$ intersects $B$. Indeed, otherwise we can deform $A$ to $M$ moving straight along these intervals $[M,M']$ and deformation will not cross $B$. Let $O$ be a point on $[M,M']$ that belongs to $B$. Let $A'$ be the central projection of $A$ from $O$ onto the unit sphere around $O$. Then $A'$ passes through two diametrically opposite points of the sphere and thus its length is at least $2\pi$. EDIT2. Exactly the same proof is published in the paper Criticality for the Gehring link problem, Geometry & Topology 10 (2006) 2055–2115, where it is credited to Marvin Ortel. EDIT3. Our original solution with Vinkovski also has been rediscovered since then. It can be seen in this file: $URL$ Thanks to Anton Petrunin for finding this file on my computer:-) 

This seems indeed equivalent to the classical question treated by Darboux, Painleve, Poincare and others. Not surprisingly it can have several different formulations. Classical formulation is the following: Given a polynomial equation $f(x,y)dx+g(x,y)dy=0$, to find with finitely many operations an integrating factor, or to prove it does not exist. The next question is "what kind of integrating factor"? The simplest case is a rational integrating factor (though more general factors were considered in the classical papers). If we look for a rational integrating factor of degree at most $n$, we can just write it with undetermined coefficients, and the question is reduced to solving a finite system of algebraic equations. There is an algorithm of doing this, if the original equation is over rational (or algebraic) numbers. So the real question is: can we bound the degree of the factor? Then the question is "bound in terms of what"? A relatively recent breakthrough in this problem is the counterexample: one cannot bound the degree of the factor in terms of degrees of $f,g$, and the types of singularities: there is a one-parametric family of equations, with singularities of fixed type (that is the type is independent of parameter) such that for a countable dense set of values of parameter it has integrating factors, but their degrees tend to infinity. MR1914932 Lins Neto, Alcides, Some examples for the Poincaré and Painlevé problems. Ann. Sci. École Norm. Sup. (4) 35 (2002), no. 2, 231–266. This paper also contains a survey of previous results. However it remains a possibility that the degree of the integrating factor can be estimated in terms of some arithmetic properties of the coefficients. Here is a survey of the topic: MR2166493 Llibre, Jaume Integrability of polynomial differential systems. Handbook of differential equations, 437–532, Elsevier/North-Holland, Amsterdam, 2004. All this was about the global aspect of the problem (as I said it has many formulations). The local aspect is usually called the Center-Focus Problem: for the same kind of system, to determine whether an equilibrium point is a center or a focus. There is an enormous literature on this, and this problem is much better understood. Just look at the "center-focus problem" as a keyword. 

If you mean that your function $w$ vanishes on the critical values and nowhere else, then the answer is no. Take $(y_1,y_2)=(x_1^2,x_1x_2)$. The Jacobian determinant is zero on the line $x_1=0$ but the image of this line is one point $(0,0)$. And the zero set of a holomorphic function cannot be one point. If you mean that $w$ vanishes on the critical values, and perhaps somewhere else, then the answer is yes and trivial: take $w=0$. EDIT. In the comments the question was modified as follows: does there exist a function $\not\equiv 0$ which is zero on the image of the critical set. To this the answer is yes when $n=2$ and no when $n\geq 3$. Consider this map for $n=3$ $$x=u+w^2,\quad y=uv+w^2,\quad z=uve^v+w^2.$$ The Jacobian in zero in sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin of and only if $uvw=0$. Take the plane $w=0$. Its image is described parametrically as $$x(u,v)=u,\quad y(u,v)=uv,\quad z(u,v)=uve^v.$$ It is a famous result of W. Osgood that there is no non-zero analytic function satisfying $G(x(u,v),y(u,v),z(u,v))\equiv 0$. Ch. Osgood, On functions of several complex variables, Trans. AMS 17 (1916), 1, 1-8, Theorem 1. When $n=2$, the image of the critical set in a neighborhood of the origin is either a point or a curve. It is well-known and easy to prove that a parametrized curve is an analytic set.
