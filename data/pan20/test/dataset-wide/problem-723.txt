It's a little more than 100$, but you could have a Garmin Edge 20 for 130$. Maybe wait a little for a special or something*. According to the post it's a good little computer and I personnaly enjoy using their Edge lineup. (* the website has a 10% anything coupon with their partner, might be worth a look, that would bring the Edge 20 to 117$, might not work for everything thought) 

So you might check those dedicated lanes. An other option would be to use Strava's Global Heatmap where you can see where people are cycling the most. You can't really see what you want exactly (dedicated lanes), but coupled with Google's map, I find it's a good start to plan a ride. 

For me, (4) is the dealbreaker for 23mm and 25mm tires. By choosing 28mm tires, I can run them at lower pressures, and therefore, have an easier time inflating the tires with the pump I carry. 

...can be used without insurance. They are barely adequate, but heavierweight and more expensive than necessary due to the limitation that the motor needs to be in a wheel hub, and thus rotate at suboptimal RPMs. I believe that by eliminating the pedals, you could easily have 750 W of electric assist at up to 40 km/h, in a lighterweight package than most electric bikes, and also for a cheaper price tag than most electric bikes. However, by eliminating the pedals, it won't be an electric bike anymore. A long time ago, there were motor vehicles with pedals, called mopeds. Then afterwards, it was realized that it is better to eliminate the pedals. The vehicles are still called mopeds even though there are no pedals. I believe a similar thing will happen with electric bikes. The pedals will be eliminated, and thus, we end up with electric scooters. 

Zero means going straight, 90+ degrees is probably impossible. So what is the maximum steering angle needed to ride safely? 

I would suggest considering two power components: (1) rotational speed and (2) torque. It should be naturally obvious that these two principles will impact the ability of a chain to jump across sprockets. As rotational speed tends towards zero, shifting becomes problematic. As torque increases, the chain will require more lateral force to be lifted above a sprocket’s cog. Going uphill while maintaining a reasonable cadence has limited negative impact on modern cassettes that have sculpted cogs to promote easier shifting. However, these designs are challenged if you are a masher (slow cadence + high torque). In the old days, riders would put less pressure on the pedals to reduce torque while keeping a high cadence. Today, higher end components work well under high torque as long as cadence stays above... I’d venture 60. 

The main reason why electric bikes aren't mainstream is the fact that human legs and electric motors want to produce power at much different RPMs. Casual cyclists pedal at around 60 RPM. Experienced cyclist can pedal at higher RPMs, 90 RPM. Both of these are nothing when compared to optimal electric motors that want to rotate at 10 000 RPM, if optimized to produce the largest possible power with lowest possible cost and lowest possible weight. At 25 km/h, a wheel with 2m circumference rotates at 208 RPM. So, pedals rotate more slowly than wheels (about 3x difference), whereas optimal electric motors want to rotate at about 50x faster than bicycle wheels. Engineering has allowed us to create a motor producing 250 watts of power within the hub of a wheel. This is bit over what casual cyclist can produce continuously. However, even causal cyclists can climb up short hills at over 500 watts, more than what these hub motors produce. These hub motors also are heavier than necessary due to being restricted to about 200 RPM, and also more expensive than necessary. If you want to create a cheap lightweight electric transportation vehicle, you need to have the gearing to increase RPMs at the electric motor. This means a drivetrain that increases RPMs at the power source, rather than decreasing them. Thus, you need to get rid of the pedals because there is no way to have both the existing drivetrain for pedals and the new drivetrain for the electric motor. It won't be an electric bicycle anymore. Such a vehicle needs to be insured. On some countries, vehicles that: 

Depends on what is meant by "best". The most thorough approach would be to remove the cassette from the wheel and clean it in an ultrasonic cleaner. Probably excessive. Second best it to remove the cassette and use a mild solvent (e.g. WD40) and a rag to clean the sprockets. This is a good time to examine sprockets for cog wear (the smaller ones in particular). It is also possible to clean in situ with a wipe, a rag or some kind of floss. Whatever you do, do not flood a mounted cassette with solvent. You might inadvertently remove lubricant from the freehub and/or wheel hub. 

This would roughly translate into 0.5 mm, probably impossible to measure while the cassette is on the wheel. A better way is to compare your old sprockets to new ones, when you clean your ageing cassette. Keeping in mind that sprocket wear is inversely proportional to the cog count, I'd suggest focusing on the 13T-15T-17T (or so) sprockets. Put the old sprocket on top of a new one (you have to purchase a replacement anyway, so buy one as a reference until the old one is worn) and inspect visually to appreciate the amount of wear at the back of the cog. 

Weight. Thicker tires weigh more. Air resistance. Thicker tires have more of it. Rolling resistance. Thicker tires have less rolling resistance, but then again this may be offset by the increased air resistance and weight. Ability to get the tire to the operating pressure with a pump you can reasonably carry with you. 

No, on any reasonable frame cracks cannot be welded unless they were at a location that was designed to be welded. A reasonable frame means lightweight here, meaning that material thickness and thus strength at all locations is optimized to be just barely enough. Welding seams have lower strength than the original material, and therefore, any welding at that location will eventually fail. You wondered how a crack can form at that location. The reason is simple: the material thickness/strength is optimized so that every location of the frame has just the bare minimum amount. Thus, there are many potential crank locations, including the head tube. 

use 2+ bags. A small handlebar bag in which you carry your valuables (phone, wallet, etc.) and the number of panniers you feel is necessary to bring your purchases back home. Bring the handlebar bag inside, as if it were a purse. You can probably lock the panniers by threading the locking cable thru the pannier(s) handle(s). 

I know nothing about the theory. But the world record for gravity bike is, according to Guinness, 103km/h. ($URL$ 

I personally remove, clean and examine my cassette once a year. If your chain is well maintained you are unlikely to have to clean your cassette more frequently. 

Speed may be considered to be the ultimate output of the cycling process and therefore performance would be measured with a chronometer/speedometer. And that would be it. Watts may be considered as an input in the cycling process. A power meter will provide an intermediate measure of effort, which is but one of the speed determinants. Several factors may be considered, some belonging to the environment (wind, traffic, etc.) some to the rider (aero position, state of mind, proper pacing, etc.), and some to the bicycle itself (aero, weight, inertia), such that speed will vary greatly for a given power level. You may also want to measure other "performance" metrics, such as how efficiently you can convert food to Watts. Heart rate monitors are well known devices. Muscle monitors are appearing over the horizon. They could conceivably be measures of metabolic performance.
