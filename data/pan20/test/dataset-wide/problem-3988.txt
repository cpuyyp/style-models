Here is an answer to question 1; the answer is conditional on the following three assumptions: (i) IQCA's provide a framework for quantum gravity, as suggested in G.M. D'Ariano, "The Dirac quantum automaton: a preview" (arXiv:1211.2479); (ii) the quantum gravity path integral takes the form of a CFT partition function, as in A. Castro et al., "The gravity dual of the Ising model" (arXiv:1111.1987); and (iii) the existence of Hilbert-space representations of G and L is a necessary or essential feature of IQCA's (which is suggested by the definitions of T and V in the above question). If (i)-(iii) hold, then a necessary condition for a non-trivial IQCA is that p<5, for the (integer) parameter p of the relevant conformal field theory (CFT). This is so because for p>4, the CFT lacks a consistent Hilbert-space interpretation: see arXiv:1111.1987 (pg. 4). The above condition strongly restricts the allowable CFT's. Therefore, it might be a good idea to define IQCA's in a more general way that does not make reference to Hilbert space. 

The answer to your question is "Yes." In trying to understand why Ackermann nonetheless wanted to distinguish proper classes such as V from sets - where V is the proper class of all sets, taken here to be a natural model of ZFC - it is necessary to take seriously Ackermann's claims about the universe V being continually "under construction," so to speak, or always in the process of being "built" (see Penelope Maddy's article "Proper Classes" (Journal of Symbolic Logic, 1983), p. 122, on this point). At some particular "time" (or "step") t in this construction process, there may exist (e.g.) classes larger than V ("superclasses") that have been obtained by iterating the power-set operation on V denumerably many times. Consider the totality T of such superclasses existing at t; i.e., T (at t) is the limit of a denumerable sequence of iterated power-set operations on V. Since T (at t) is clearly not a natural model of ZFC, it cannot be regarded as a new "universe" that supersedes or replaces V. Hence, those collections which (at t) are members of T but not of V are not members of a suitable universe or natural model; and so they are to be distinguished from the members of V, a distinction expressed by calling them "proper classes" (and calling the members of V "sets"). One glaring problem with this account is that it's unclear what we're supposed to take as the time t. Why, in particular, should we suppose that t is such that the power set operation on V has been iterated denumerably many times (or even some nonzero number of times)? Without any constraints on t, there's simply no way to know what proper classes we're supposed to regard as existing; and, in fact, there are no theoretical constraints on what t's value is. Hence, there's no basis for saying anything definite about proper classes at all; and so it seems best, as Andreas Blass said, to treat Ackermann's "proper classes" simply as sets. 

You have to introduce the language of sheaves. Then, the coefficients can be described succinctly as a locally constant sheaf. Alternatively, you can view the coefficient system as a bundle over your space $BG$ with $A$ fibers. Locally, the coefficients behave as if the $G$-action were trivial, but if one considers a loop that represents a nontrivial element of $\pi_1(BG) = G$, monodromy comes into play. 

In modern terms, this measures the degree of the Gauss map $\Gamma(\gamma_1,\gamma_2): S^1 \times S^1 \to S^2$. See $URL$ 

Gauss defined the linking number of two closed curves $\gamma_i: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with an integral. 

Caveat lector: This does not address your questions directly, but I think that it's interesting and somewhat relevant. The $n$th Catalan number counts the number of walks of length $2n$, beginning and ending at the origin, in the positive cone of the root lattice of type $A_1$. This counts the dimension of the invariant subspace of endomorphisms of $2n$-fold tensor power of the standard irrep $V$, relating back to Scott's answer. This phenomenon generalizes to other root systems. 

Since, $b$ commutes with the bar involution, this basis is bar invariant as well. Explicitly, $C_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} (-1)^{\ell(w)+\ell(x)} \bar p_{x,w} T_x$. So $C_w = \bar{P}^{-1} P C'_w$ which seems hard to compute in general. 

Aaron Lauda has a nice description using the package XY-pic here. There are commands that generate pieces of knots (such as crossings in various orientations), although I prefer just using the \crv "curve" command to make splines. 

Here's a recent example. $URL$ Adam McDougall constructs a "diagramless" homology theory that ends up being essentially equivalent to Khovanov homology. 

1 Many important properties of topological spaces are preserved by continuous maps (but not necessarily open maps): connectedness and compactness come to mind immediately. But more importantly, the most familiar, natural maps that we can define are continuous, but not necessarily open: polynomials $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$. 2 Inverse image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup. 3 There is a contravariant functor from the category Set to itself, mapping a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and sending the morphism $f:X \to Y$ to the inverse image $f^{-1}:\mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$. A "purely symmetric" function would be a symmetric relation on $X \times Y$, no? Functions are, after all, relations with an extra property that deliberately breaks the symmetry! 

In Cazenave's Semilinear Schrödinger Equation, page 56, he describes derivation of conservation of charge and energy of the equation $iu_t+\Delta u+|u|u=0$, ($\alpha=\lambda=1$ and $n=3$, if referring to the book), where $u$ must be a function, which decays rapidly at infinity. 1) Conservation of charge Multiply the equation by $\bar{u}$, integrate over $\mathbb R^3$ and take the imaginary part to obtain $\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\mathbb{R^n}}|u(t,x)|^2dx=0$. What I do is multiply both sides by $\bar{u}$ and get $i u_t \bar{u}+\bar{u}\Delta u+ |u|^3=0$. Now taking the complex conjugate yields $-i \bar{u}_t u+u\Delta \bar{u}+ |u|^3=0$. And subtracting the second equation from the first one we obtain $i(u_t \bar{u}+\bar{u}_t u)+\bar{u}\Delta u-u\Delta \bar{u}=0$, which is equivalent to $i\frac{d}{dt}(u\bar{u})+\bar{u}\Delta u-\overline{\bar{u}\Delta u}=0$ and thus to $i\frac{d}{dt}|u|^2+ 2i\mathbf{Im}(\bar{u}\Delta u)=0$. This, however, indicates that the whole left part is imaginary, while we need the first term one only. $\underline{\mathbf{Question:}}$ Is this correct and is it here the moment when $\bar{u}\Delta u-u\Delta \bar{u}$ should be integrated over $\mathbb{R}^3$ and e.g. and Divergence Theorem used? 2) Conservation of energy Multiply the equation by $\bar{u}_t$, integrate over $\mathbb{R}^3$, take the real part and obtain $\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}(\frac{1}{2}|\nabla u|^2-\frac{1}{3}|u|^3)dx=0$. Multiplying the equation by $\bar{u}_t$, then taking the complex conjugate and summing up the two equations leads to $\nabla\cdot (\bar{u}_t\nabla u+u_t\nabla\bar{u})-\frac{d}{dt}|\nabla u|^2+|u|\frac{d}{dt}|u|^2=0$. This is equivalent to $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{Re}(\bar{u}_t\nabla u)-\frac{d}{dt}|\nabla u|^2+\frac{2}{3}\frac{d}{dt}|u|^3=0$. Again everything on the left side is real and we need to get rid of $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{Re}(\bar{u}_t\nabla u)$. $\underline{\mathbf{Question:}}$ Is the above reasoning correct and is it here the moment when $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{Re}(\bar{u}_t\nabla u)$ should be integrated over $\mathbb{R}^3$ and e.g. and Divergence Theorem used? I would very much appreciate if someone tells me how to tackle this. I think it is not that difficult, but am stuck. Thanks everyone! 

My question is from Cazenave's book "Semilinear Schrödinger Equation", page 35. I am stuck with Step 2 of the Strichartz's estimates. The book says that $||\Phi_f(t)||_{L^2}^2=\left(\int_0^t \mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s)ds,\int_0^t \mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma)d\sigma\right)_{L^2}=$ $\underbrace{\int_0^t\int_0^t\left( \mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s), \mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma)\right)_{L^2}d\sigma ds=\int_0^t \int_0^t \left( f(s),\mathcal{T}(s-\sigma)f(\sigma)\right)_{L^2}d\sigma ds=}_?$ $=\int_0^t\left(f(s),\Theta_{t,f}(s)\right)_{L^2}ds$, where $\Theta_{t,f}(s)$ was defined earlier in the chapter, but it is not important for the purpose of this question. $\mathcal{T}(t)$ is defined as the group of isometries on $L^2(\Omega)$ generated by the skew-adjoint operator $iA$, where $A$ is the Laplacian with the Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$. On the other hand there is a theorem which says that $\mathcal{T}(t)\phi(x)=(4\pi it)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}e^\frac{i|x-y|^2}{4t}\phi(y)dy$ for suitable functions $\phi$. I would really appreciate if someone could give me a hand. I actually struggle with the third equality, namely how the identity below is determined: $\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t} (\mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s),\mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma))_{L^2} d\sigma ds=\int_{0}^{t}\int_{0}^{t} (f(s),\mathcal{T}(s-\sigma)f(\sigma))_{L^2} d\sigma ds$. If I am not wrong, I need to prove that $\int\mathcal{T}(t-s)f(s)\overline{\mathcal{T}(t-\sigma)f(\sigma)}=\int f(s)\overline{\mathcal{T}(s-\sigma)f(\sigma)}$, where the $L^2$ inner product is defined by $(u,v)_{L^2}$=Re $\int_{\Omega}u(x)\overline{v(x)}dx$. Thanks in advance! 

Background Inside the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ (with loop value $\delta=-[2]$ and standard generators $e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$), the Jones-Wenzl idempotent is the unique non-zero element $f^{(n)}$ satisfying $$ f^{(n)}f^{(n)} = f^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad e_i\;f^{(n)} = 0 = f^{(n)}e_i \quad \textrm{for each } i.$$ Consider the Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$, $n\ge3$, normalized so that $(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0$, where $q$ is generic. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the two-sided cellular ideal generated by canonical basis element $$C_{121} = T_1T_2T_1-qT_1T_2-qT_2T_1+q^2T_1+q^2T_2-q^3.$$ The assignment $\mathcal{H}_n \rightarrow TL_n$ given by $T_i \mapsto e_i + q$ is a surjective $\mathbb{C}(q)$-algebra homomorphism with kernel $\mathcal{I}$. We can lift the generators $e_i$ in $TL_n$ to the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements $C_i=T_i-q \in \mathcal{H}\_n$. In fact, we have $C_{121} = C_1C_2C_1 - C_1$, hence the relation down below. Rescaling a bit, $E=-\frac{1}{[3]!}C_{121}$ is an idempotent, corresponding to the partition $(1,1,1)$. Actually, all of the primitive idempotents in $\mathcal{H}_n$ that correspond to Young diagrams with more than two rows live in the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. Now, any preimage of $f^{(n)}$ in the Hecke algebra (call it $F^{(n)}$) satisfies $$F^{(n)}F^{(n)} \equiv F^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad C_iF^{(n)} \equiv 0 \equiv F^{(n)}C_i \quad (\operatorname{mod} \mathcal{I})$$ Question 

Alexander's Theorem guarantees that every oriented link is the closure of some braid. In other words, the map $$ \displaystyle \coprod\_n \mathcal B_n\longrightarrow \{\text{ oriented links }\} $$ is surjective. One algorithm (I'm actually not sure that it's Alexander's original demonstration) involves choosing a basepoint in the complement of a diagram for the link and applying Reidemeister moves until the resulting diagram winds around the point in a consistent direction, at which point the diagram is manifestly the closure of a link. 

The Euclidean ball takes up the most space in dimension 5. $V = \frac {8 \pi^2} {15} R^5 \approx 5.26\ldots R^5$ 

I apologize that this is vague, but I'm trying to understand a little bit of the historical context in which the zoo of quantum invariants emerged. For some reason, I have in my head the folklore: The discovery in the 80s by Jones of his new knot polynomial was a shock because people thought that the Alexander polynomial was the only knot invariant of its kind (involving a skein relation, taking values in a polynomial ring, ??). Before Jones, there were independent discoveries of invariants that each boiled down to the Alexander polynomial, possibly after some normalization. Is there any truth to this? Where is this written?
