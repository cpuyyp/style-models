But of course nobody would have to spell that out; we all know what you mean when you say "intolerance" and "intolerant of intolerance" is just a fun phrase. Finally, the statement isn't equivalent to the liar's paradox. If we affirm the liar's paradox we deny it, and if we deny the liar's paradox we affirm it. But if we deny "I am intolerant of intolerance" all we have is 

You should ask yourself two kinds of questions: First, are humans in fact naturally immoral? Why would those statements be true? Does the lived experience of men tell you anything about how they necessarily view people of other genders? Where would such behavior even come about, and is it not more plausible that it is inculcated in us by society? (Consider the motives of those who say such things. If somebody is telling you that "it is men's nature to be misogynists" my guess is they aren't doing it out of a spirit of honest intellectual inquiry.) And second, are humans in fact naturally anything? The idea that humans have free will is not a new one. If that's the case, then while there are biological requirements of humanity, there are no behavioral requirements. The idea that we "have" to act in some way is false, so there is no conflict between our "natural" obligations and our moral obligations. 

which is even worse. Unfortunately truth is defined inside a particular language. Therefore we cannot tell within the language itself which one is in the wrong: or any one of to . Instead of throwing out particular theorems because they are paradoxical, we throw out sets of rules that generate those theorems. The new set of rules in the case of set theory had the axiom of restricted comprehension which avoids the problem. 

First up, we need to correct a big difficulty, you seem to be conflating truth and provability. A does not imply □A. There's plenty of scope for contingent truth in system K- that is: there is plenty of scope for dealing with true propositions A which are true but not necessarily so- which just, as it were, happen to be the case. That Nixon was elected president, for example, is true in the actual world, but that does not entail that he was elected president in all possible worlds. Now we have that under our belt, why is modal logic significantly different from classical logic? Firstly, the modal operators are at least potentially very much world dependent (provided we do not include additional axioms such as S4- mentioned in the SEP article you linked). That is to say: from worlds which are possible from our point of view, we may be able to see other worlds as possible which were not possible from our original point of view. This fact (kept track of in the access relations between the worlds) means that we must do some extra work in evaluating modal propositions, chasing around a potential web of possibility. Secondly, things get screwy when we introduce quantifiers. Since necessity and possibility are quantifiers of a sort themselves, we might assume they commute, that is: 

But this is not necessarily the case- the above argument schema would say (roughly) for example that "There is possibly a man in my closet" implied "There is a man who is possibly in my closet", which are very different things (the latter seems to imply that you know of a particular guy, which seems somewhat stronger). This (I would say metaphysically shaky) argument schema is a corollary of the Barcan formula, and has stirred up some controversy. If we introduce it as an axiom, though, that makes for some logical gymnastics that properly transcend those of simple in-world deduction. The above considerations point to the nub of the difference between modal and classical logics. In short: deductions occur not just in worlds, but between them, and that means weird stuff goes down... 

At the tail end of Kant and the Critique of Pure Reason Gardner discusses Kant's influence on his successors. He claims---and I'm paraphrasing here---Hegel wanted his metaphysics to be scientific, i.e., to all unfold from a single principle. Kant's work does not descend from a single principle, but instead draws from actual experience to get us, for instance, inner and outer sense, and the specific categories. This rings true. There are certainly a number of times when Kant seems to throw his hands in the air and say that things just are. Hegel's response, quoth Gardner, was to try and make a new system, which would surpass Kant's, and all unfold from a single principle. Is this actually Hegel's definition of a science? I couldn't find anything online that would confirm it. I've only read PR and some of PS; I can't say much about Hegel's metaphysics. But in PR Hegel explicitly states that philosophy is a circle. Of course a circle has no point of origin. Did Hegel think his system did indeed unfold from a single point? How did he explain this, given the whole "philosophy is a circle" thing? 

There are more objects that can be spoken of, or conceived, than there are objects that can be experienced, or that we could have direct physical evidence of. Consider God. God doesn't exist in time, but our experiences take place in time, so we cannot possibly experience God. Yet we can plainly talk about God---we're doing so right now. You might not like this example, especially if you don't believe in God. In that case, try what it is like to be a bat. Presumably it is like something to be a bat. You don't know what it is like to be a bat, because you are not a bat. You can't see a bat seeing things, only its head and eyes moving. Maybe one day we will be able to experience life as a bat. (I don't think so, but I suppose it's not inconceivable. The words are certainly sayable.) But if you did experience batness, you still wouldn't experience experiencing batness. You don't see seeing or hear hearing, you just see and hear. We know about God and the internal experience of bats not through sensing but through thinking (in combination with sensing, in the case of bats). I think that's the only way to gain knowledge of non-experiential objects. 

Your second premise could be vacuously satisfied- i.e. there might be no illogical men in the world: without a witness (guaranteed only when you add the aditional premise ∃x~L(x)), the existential quantifier in your conclusion would not be true (in the sense of Tarski). As this remains a possibility, Caroll's argument is indeed not formally logical- this is, I suppose, what one might expect from someone writing 40 years before sentential calculus was formally axiomised. 

But as a thought experiment, what are its consequences? Certainly they are not the same as those of the premise itself. And has anyone attempted to rehabilitate this notion, in a thought experiment or otherwise, in a manner other than the (fairly obviously futile) direct argument toward the concrete reality of the eternal return? 

Any logical picture shewing my knowledge of p occurring in my mind must logically shew its own presence. As Wittgenstein demonstrated in his later work Philosophical Investigations, such accounts of thought are palpably false. To see why such accounts are false in full generality is rather a lot of work, so let's attack just the relevant bit of it. To adapt an example from section 60 (of PI): to bring a broomstick and brush attached as to make a broom, connotes a different thought than to bring a broom, although they are logically equivalent. That is to say exhaustive logical consequence is not a feature of thought. Though one may derive second order knowledge of p from knowledge of p, one need not in knowing p. To conclude, a thought experiment: In a world where knowing state secrets is punishable by death; a man discovers, while walking in the park, an official document declaring the location of his children's school to be a nuclear testing site- at the bottom of the page; the words [top secret], the government seal, and a reminder of the law. Is his first thought for his own life, or his children's? Suppose somehow, both the reminder of the law, the secret itself and that it is a secret were conveyed simultaneously (for example, if there were a single monosyllabic word in the man's language containing all this information); what then? *Although we may think plenty that is irrational or unreasonable. IMO the character Spock in the original Star Trek has a lot to answer for for confusing these three terms in the eyes of the public... 

This is evidence for the previous sentence; rationality needs to be able to discriminate between good and bad beliefs. 

We shouldn't consider the purely economic strain of Marxist thought because it does indeed seem to have been debunked. The labor theory of value is simply false, so his prophecies have not come to pass. The revolution was supposed to be a historical necessity, even if not a historical inevitability, and yet while it has not happened, other world-historical events have. Plus workers are not necessarily paid merely what they need to survive. We (well, I) no longer live in industrial, but rather post-industrial nations, and Marx could not possibly have foreseen post-industrialism. Wikipedia seems to think the last big thing in the field was done by Kautsky, so my feelings are perhaps not uncommon. I highly recommend pursuing intersectional studies as well as decolonization. For the latter Frantz Fanon is particularly well regarded - The Wretched of the Earth is a good place to start. For the former, Simone de Beauvoir's Second Sex is rightfully a classic of feminist philosophy. It isn't strictly speaking Marxist but certainly builds on Marxist logic, e.g., the way material circumstances shape ideas - in this case, woman's oppression being internalized. Her work has been much improved-upon. I'd recommend, to start, Judith Butler and Patricia Collins. Collins' Black Feminist Thought is an ideal introduction to third-wave, intersectional feminism. (See also this.) Butler is a dense, maybe inaccessible writer who owes a lot to Derrida. Her main claim is that gender is performative---see Gender Trouble. Politics: Badiou is a Maoist and metaphysician who tries to tie the two together. His main work is Being and Event, but it's pretty dense and uses a lot of set theory. If you just want to get a handle on how he thinks Manifesto for Philosophy is probably a better call. Toni Negri (with Michael Hardt) wrote the landmark Empire, which draws on a lot of the work done by others on this list. It's about modern-day imperialism and contains a strong critique of dialectics and mediation as tools for thought. And finally we have ideology/culture generally. Gramsci's Prison Notebooks are on this front far ahead of their time. Adorno and Althusser are chronologically the next step, but I haven't read too much of either. Supposedly "Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses" is quite good, and that's by Althusser. As for Adorno (with Horkheimer), you'll want Dialectic of Enlightenment, though you have to take the bits on jazz with a grain of salt. Finally there are Foucault and Zizek. It's hard to know what Foucault's actual political beliefs are but he is entirely in debt to Marx and Nietzsche for his genealogical account of oppression. No matter what your interests are you should read Discipline and Punish. Zizek is controversial because he's still alive and sometimes he says really tremendously stupid things but I found The Sublime Object of Ideology to be pretty good. What's really accessible, and in fact down right funny, are his movies: Pervert's Guide to Cinema and Pervert's Guide to Ideology. They're a very fun jumping-off point. 

To put it briefly, you have told the logical system it is not snowing. Your statement (4) is just the principle of explosion in action: if it is snowing (and, as you have already told the system, it is also not snowing) then black is white, I am pope and, yes, it is also raining. If 'A is false' is taken as a premise then 'A-> whatever the heck you like' is a theorem, because the conditional is never satisfied. Edit: Here's a proof (1) ~A (2) ~A v Whatever the hell you like (By disjunction introduction) (3) A-> Whatever the hell you like (By material implication) 

A philosophical project of mine depends on an assertion which at first seems problematic, but one that I believe is correct. Background Following Husserl, modern philosophy is in accord that the uniting reality of mental states is that they are intentional in the sense of being object-directed. Debates concerning the semantics of 'object directed', particularly concerning those attitudes that effect object-directedness, have represented a crucial battleground for the spat between functionalists and qualophiles concerning philosophy of the mind. But can one not describe intentionality better than simply as 'object directed'? Assertion If one follows Wittgenstein in assenting that there is no separation between an act and its apprehension, does it not follow that our thoughts about objects are to an extent as if in their presence? To put it another way, is there not a (necessary, non-zero) correlation of affect, attitude and (inner) perception between thoughts of an object and those that would be directly caused by the object's presence? Of course one distinguishes pictures of objects and objects. Absences are treated as a serial property of impresence at points of attention in an environment. Abstractions are seen to place oneself in the presence of exemplars, be they real or imaginary. So my questions: Are there obvious counter-examples to this assertion? Are there any philosophers who have explicitly dealt with phenomenology on these terms? 

There is indeed a rule saying that if a set of statements generates a contradiction, the conjunction of those statements is false. We do not allow anything that violates basic logic. How can we have Russell's Paradox, then? The problem is, we have no notion of the priority of rules inside a particular formal language. So while our principle of non-contradiction tells us that 

Unfortunately I don't yet have an inference rule for -introduction, assuming one exists, which is not a given. If it doesn't, though, then there is no way to leave as primitive, because I cannot prove using only . I will update this answer if I find anything new, and accept it if I do. 

For Kant, we are prohibited from using people as purely means. Unfortunately things like physically stopping someone from doing violence onto you just because you don't want to be wounded seems to very much be using them as a means and not an end. If we are unable to literally escape* being submitted to unethical treatment, do we simply have to grin and bear it? *In the "what if an ax murderer asks me where my friend is, shouldn't I lie then" the obvious solution is to just remain silent. I'm thinking of cases where there is no similar way out, e.g., you are trapped. 

(OGM 1:13). The triumph of slave morality came about when Christianity conquered the west---Christians being the inventors of slave morality. (Actually here Nietzsche says Jews but he's pretty clearly not talking about actual Jews; he has nothing but praise for the Old Testament.) This is probably the weakest part of the argument and some later commentators take the slaves' revolt in morality as either semi-mythical or tied to capitalism. Now unless you are already inclined in a Nietzschean direction this should all seem pretty implausible. So much of his argument depends on how it all hangs together as a coherent story, and I cannot present very much of the story here at all. So I'll leave you with a motivating example: 

The first situation is an exhaustive disproof of existence, and is (if I understand what you have written) sound in its logic. The second is perhaps reasonable, and (again if I understand your writing) is called inductive reasoning, it is however not logical- not a valid deduction, as was explosively pointed out by Hume in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. As such, in 'the finite case' they are profoundly different, one being logically valid, the other not. When the bag of balls becomes infinitely large, however, the situations become nearly identical in practice, as in finite time one can never check every ball to see that it is not red, and so some inductive reasoning is necessary in both cases. In the latter case, however, they are not entirely the same- for the first situation is still slightly better than the second. In the first situation, we make a hypothesis 'there are no red balls in the bag' that we subsequently test in a way that could falsify it: in the second, since we do not repeat the experiment after we make our hypothesis, our hypothesis is not fallible (this is important for reasons articulated by Karl Popper amongst others). 

This, when one unpicks to a decent enough approximation what he means by the terms, seems to make some sense- after all, it seems we cannot think anything truly illogical*, and I certainly seem to have an internal model of the things I am thinking about. Indeed, if one hunts for the intuitive appeal in the claim "knowledge => knowledge of knowledge", one sees something similar, for: 

In Three Dialogues, Berkeley advances a theory of subjective idealism. Things only exist as experiences of individual consciousnesses. These things are static and themselves unthinking, as they are pure ideas. And they persist even when we are not looking at them because God is looking at them all the time. Here's the thing, though---if esse est percipi, how do we exist? We aren't always perceiving ourselves. We sleep, for instance. And our actual selves are not just pure ideas. We are active and thinking. So we can't exist in God's mind in the same way that, for instance, a tree does. If only unthinking substances can be perceived, and only that which is perceived can exist, how does anything exist to do the perceiving? 

This sentence is unclear and iffy. I'm not sure why the beliefs formed by the already-mentioned mechanisms wouldn't be supported by evidence. The testimony of others, our senses, and our memories all seem to me to be evidence that a belief is accurate. But I suppose we'll have to wait for Chapter 5 to really understand what the author is talking about. 

EDIT: For any future readers: I've picked virmaior's answer as I think it answers the question fullest but Patrick R's answer is also great and gives some very useful context about the translation. 

It's obvious that relative wonder is compatible with a scientific perspective. My first instinct was to say that Dawkins only feels relative wonder, while Keats feels absolute wonder. But I don't think that has to be true. There's a way in which the scientist's rainbow is no longer absolutely wonderful. One of the great things about rainbows is that they don't require any analysis; just look at them and you'll feel joy. The experience is sort of unmediated. But then look at the rainbow through the eyes of a physicist. The rainbow is no longer mysterious and no longer experienced unmediated. That's not to say a physicist can't enjoy rainbows; they can, but not in the same way as usual while they are investigating its electromagnetic properties. But I think Keats goes too far if he says that science must destroy miracles. Instead it can defer them. The miraculous thing is no longer: Look, a rainbow!, but: Look, the amazing intricacies of refraction and wave motion! This may well be the wonder Dawkins is describing. I know some mathematicians who feel the same way. To your last thought: On what principled grounds can we say rainbows are wonderful but the US tax code is not? I'm not sure that any exist, but do we need them? It doesn't seem to me that there's an exact science of wonder. Nor should there be. Part of the wonder of wonders is their fuzziness, the way they appeal to me, not some lifeless objective standard.
