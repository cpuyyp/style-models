First off I have to say commiserations - I've been through very similar and it wasn't pleasant. A previous employer of mine operated a similar system and any instances of clocking in late or clocking out early were automatically flagged not only to HR but to the directors as well! Working 5+ hours of unpaid overtime (finishing after 1am) on business critical systems and then being reprimanded and threatened with lost pay for clocking in literally one minute late that morning was just one example of the sort of rubbish they used to pull. IANL so I can't comment on the legality or not of the pay deduction that they did to you so I'll keep this answer focused on the clocking system and it's application to you. Can it be "fixed"? Sadly in my experience the answer was a resounding "no", the company was an awful employer and the draconian clocking system was just one manifestation of the way they treated their staff and after a year of running myself into the ground I left for somewhere a great deal less Kafkaesque and the improvement in my self esteem and general stress levels was remarkable. I'll admit my own experiences mean I'm not 100% objective about this but I think my advice is still to get out, run, vamoose, scarper, make like a tree etc. In docking your pay (even if it turns out not to be illegal) they have made a clear statement of intent that they are going to stand behind this new timekeeping policy and I hate to say it but I think that speaks volumes about how much they value you. That said your situation is slightly different than mine in that you have a positive history with the organisation and role that pre-dates the current problems so there may be some hope! If you'd like to at least try to resolve the situation then you need to give them a business reason to change it. Simply refusing to use the clocking system but otherwise carrying on as before doesn't really do that - the work is still getting done and it just creates disciplinary issues for HR to deal with, but that's part of their reason for existing anyway so the only party really having any negative consequences is you in having to deal with the stress and any mucking about with your wages. By the time it gets to the point where it has to be addressed by your manager or senior management (I'm assuming from what you've posted that your manager isn't senior management) you'll be thoroughly annoyed and that will play nicely into the picture that the HR department would likely present - that of a disgruntled employee who believes that the rules shouldn't apply to them, i.e. you are the problem. Instead you need to make it apparent that HR and their rigid policy is the problem so I'd recommend that you simply (and immediately) begin working to a strict 9-5 schedule. I wouldn't announce this as some kind of "stand" or "protest" or anything like that I'd just start doing it and re-adjust all your planned timescales for any deliverables to take into account the reduction in your hours. Make sure that otherwise you are a model employee, you work hard, you don't grumble, you just clock in and and out and get on with it - but only between 9 and 5. Then one of two things will happen: They won't notice/nothing happens This is unlikely given the role you have and the quantity of extra hours you were doing but if it does then you can enjoy your new work/life balance happy in the knowledge that they didn't appreciate your additional efforts any way. They notice project slip/they ask you to do something out of hours At this point you as calmly and dispassionately as possible let them know that you have been happy to be flexible in the past and would be happy to do so again but that flexibility has to go both ways and that as the company (via HR) has made it's position clear you've adjusted your flexibility to match. Point out that you've tried to compromise already and been rebuffed but if they are willing to compromise so are you, hopefully either your manager or if they don't have the authority someone further up the ladder they escalate it to will be able to do the math that a system aimed at improving productivity in the business has, in your case, reduced it and that blindly enforcing arbitrary rules unilaterally is not worth the "cost" to the business in terms of the hours of your time they have lost and a satisfactory compromise will be worked out. If you get fobbed off with a "my hands are tied" or "It's policy" type answer then be understanding, maybe even commiserate with them, but stick to your guns and say that if anything changes you're happy to revisit the question and carry on with your 9-5 pattern. One such conversation might not be sufficient to get any traction but eventually they will have to work something out with you or just accept the business impact of their choice. If it's the latter then there are probably ways they can make your work life unpleasant but I believe Australian labor laws mean they can't dismiss you as long as you're complying with your contract (which you will be) so you can just take that as a big flashing neon sign that this organisation probably isn't somewhere you want to be working and you can start using all that extra time you used to spend working extra hours for them to go find an employer that will value you. Make sure if you are going to go this route that you make sure firstly that you are fulfilling your contract (and HR's schedule) to the letter and secondly make sure everything is documented, if you have a conversation with your manager about it then summarize it in an e-mail to him/her afterwards (make sure you have copies of any pertinent e-mails outside of company-controlled systems - print it or bcc to your personal e-mail if allowable under their IT policy) and always, always, keep in mind that this is a business relationship between you and the company, no matter what relationship you might have with individual colleagues or managers it's the company you are dealing with here and the company is not your friend, it is not your family and you don't owe them anything more than what you are contracted to do and compensated for. 

From what you've said it sounds like you're doing satisfactory work. I suspect you are being too hard on yourself. But I can certainly understand why you're worried, and feeling financially insecure. I have a few suggestions that may help. If you haven't done so recently, visit your doctor and check that your recovery from the surgery is going as expected. The doctor may want to do some blood tests to verify that it's just the medication making you tired; that there isn't another problem like an iron deficiency contributing to your lack of energy. After a long period of low energy and reduced activity, it's not easy to return to full activity. Even if you were back to 100% energy tomorrow, it would still take time to regain muscle strength, etc. You might ask the doctor if it's OK to do some mild exercise, like walking. Even if you can't go far, just making a habit of some sort of exercise may help. Getting a bit more financial security will lower your stress level. However, it sounds like you don't have the energy yet to take on additional work. But I think you're onto a good thing with the research you're already doing. Keep learning. Learn things that you're interested in, and also gain skills that will make it easier to get a job in case you need to. Having a plan and working slowly but steadily toward a goal will probably help you feel more secure about your finances. 

I have the problems you describe, but to a lesser degree. I will be able to recognise someone after I have encountered them regularly, in situations where I know their name, over a few weeks. I haven't been diagnosed, but my guess is that I either have mild prosopagnosia or am at the low-functioning edge of "normal". Perhaps my experience will help. I smile at everyone. Partly that's because of my difficulty with faces; I don't want to offend anyone. But partly it's because, as corny as it sounds, smiling makes the world a better place. Whenever someone smiles at me, it makes me feel a little better about my day, and I assume others have the same reaction. Also, I am an introvert; smiling lets others know that I'm not standoffish even though I may not say much. I am still "caught out" occasionally when people realise that I don't recognise them. While that's a little embarassing for me, the other person never seems to be offended. You may not feel comfortable smiling at everyone, and I don't think you need to be someone you're not. But many people with prosopagnosia chose to smile at everyone; it's a common coping technique. You might want to give it a try. 

It sounds to me like the problem has nothing to do with race or ethnicity per se, it's that you feel excluded from the team. That sort of thing can happen if everyone but you loves football and talks about it all the time, or if they all went to the same college, or if everyone but you hangs out together, etc. Even if you didn't mind, this situation is not good for the team as a whole. So here are a few suggestions: 

When learning a new programming language, framework, or similar technology, I usually pick a fun or useful application to build with it. That way, as I'm reading up on the new technology, in the back of my mind I'm thinking about how I can use bits of what I'm learning to implement some part of my application. For example, a friend of mine wanted to learn Visual Basic. He knew that I was trying to improve my sheet music reading skills, so he decided to create a simple application that would display notes on a musical scale, I would type the corresponding note, and it would check my answer. (It was great!) So as he was reading, say, about how to display an image, he was thinking "I could use this to display the notes". You mention your twins. Why not learn a new technology in order to create a simple computer game for them? It doesn't need to be anything fancy; It could be a trivia quiz or tic-tac-toe, but they will love it because it was made especially for them. You can customise it with pictures of them, or things they like. They'll probably enjoy seeing the application evolve, from the time you first figure out how to display something until the time it's finished. Or maybe you can create an application that will be useful to yourself or your wife, perhaps something related to a hobby. When you have an application in mind, you'll be more engaged with the technology you're trying to learn. You'll be an active reader, constantly thinking of how you can apply what you're learning. You'll have a motivation to keep reading. ("Daddy, have you gotten any further with my game"?) This approach helps with all types of learning. Want to learn a new language? Think about something you'd like to do with it, like go on a trip and speak to the locals. As you're learning, you'll be more engaged because you're thinking of how you'll use the knowledge. 

Setting aside the roles the two of you have as Tech Lead and Project Manager respectively there is the trump card that he is your boss. So really you need to bear that dynamic in mind - I'm not saying don't ever put your case forward when the two of you disagree but once you feel that you have made your case then if your boss still insists on their preferred choice then you just have to go along with it. You need to be as unemotional about the matter being discussed as much as possible - from your post it sounds like your boss has form for getting aggressive in these discussions and as tempting/natural as it may feel you can't rise to that because that will only escalate his emotional response and dig him in further. If their goal is basically good but their proposed method is where you have the problem the make sure to repeatedly stress that you agree with what they are trying to achieve, seriously actually use the words "I agree with you" where you can because this can defuse the confrontational tone that these sorts of discussions can develop. If you feel that going the their way would have serious negative consequences on the quality of the output I would make sure you document your concerns (and the associated consequences) over e-mail as a CYA move, this doesn't have to be a confrontational thing or anything like that - just put them down in an e-mail while the issue is still being "discussed" e.g: 

It would be wildly inappropriate if you managed this person but as you don't I'd say it's fine (assuming the manager-turned-engineer is happy with it of course), not ideal but nothing drastically wrong with it. There are some things to bear in mind though: 

I'm guessing from your username that this is for a job in marketing? I would surmise that they are more interested in the quality of the presentation rather than the subject so that gives you a fair amount of latitude and there are Pros and Cons of either choice: Work Related Pros: 

Unless there are specific obligations to do so in your contract then no they aren't required to participate in mediation. Refusing to do so would count against them if the matter were ever to make it to an employment tribunal (for constructive or unfair dismissal for example) as while it's a purely voluntary process from a legal perspective tribunals in the UK tend to take the position that they should be a last resort and that all other reasonable steps should be taken to try and resolve the matter first. Obviously this only applies if the employee can show evidence that they requested mediation and had that request denied, so even if your friend is certain that mediation wouldn't work or that the employer wouldn't engage in it if asked they still need to ask for it as a demonstration of good faith. To address your last point normally mediation would be a stage after a PIP, since a PIP is an internal process. Mediation is for when you've exhausted all the internal processes and still haven't resolved the dispute. 

As nothing has been made official yet you aren't committed to anything so you do still have some options, albeit limited ones. I'm assuming here that the "too low" remark refers to your presented wage compared with the market rather than it being too low for your own financial situation. Option 1: Accept the current figure and play the long game Yu can take the offer as it stands and continue on in the job and and try and make the best of it. Perform the job to the best of your abilities and try and use that and your reseach of the market to try and correct the figure at the next negotiation opportunity. It does mean you will likely be behind the curve for a while in terms of wages but at least your job search will be done for now. Option 2: Try and re-open negotiations You can try and go back to them and say that you have reviewed the number you previously stated and that you consider it too low. This is unlikely to be well recieved, even assuming the company would be willing to pay the higher number (not gauranteed given their intitial offer was even lower then your counter) then at best you look a bit indecisive and at worst you look a bit underhanded for changing the goalposts on them and this may well affect your working experience with this company. If you aren't planning on this being a long term job though then it might work out ok for you. Of course there is the possibility that they will either stick at the current offer (in which case you may have harmed your reputation with them for no gain) or they may just pull the offer and your job hunt goes back to square one. Option 3: Act as if you are going to walk away You could give them a polite but generic refusal to the offer, and if they are keen to secure your services then they may ask if there is anything they can do to change your mind. Then you can come back with a higher figure. It's a bit sneaky and you really need to be comfortable with the possibility that they will just let you walk but it's probably the best way of getting more money right now from them without harming your reputation in their eyes.
