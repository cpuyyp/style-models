If this happened tomorrow, I think the only place people might survive without energy from the sun is Iceland. The population is small, they already generate a significant proportion of their electricity from geothermal power, and they are used to cold weather. I'm not considering oil rich places like Alaska because that is really stored energy from photosynthesis. But if we do consider them, the South Pole research station is another place that might hold out, as there are a lot of smart people there, though maybe not with the right skills. The other thing is, keeping warm in a geothermal area is significantly simpler than in an oil-rich area. All you have to do is dig down! The Maori of New Zealand cook food underground using rocks heated by fire, but the practice surely originates from geothermal cooking. In a matter of days, though, it's going to get really cold, and carry on till it gets to about the night time temperature of the moon (approx -233C.) That's below the freezing point of nitrogen and oxygen. Obviously it could take decades for the oceans to freeze, so I would expect the temperature to hold at a plateau somewhat below zero C for a very long time So the people of Iceland are going to have to be very resourceful and build an insulated biosphere in record time, and then will have a few decades to make it airtight. Food is likely to last from months to years, but ultimately it will have to be grown inside the biosphere using geothermal electricity. I think they could possibly survive, but it wouldn't be much fun. Given more advanced technology (fusion reactors?) and a decent warning, I think humanity could make a good go of it, but living on a sunless Earth would be considerably more difficult than living on present-day Mars. 

In case of tornadoes, the scouts of the army are disguised as storm watchers. They ride in big SUVs and follow the tornadoes to the town. When the time is right they give the signal. The data from the weather satellites is collected by a supercomputing center in Alabama to which the enemy has access because they bribed some employees or they are blackmailing them, or they simply hacked into it since the sysadmin is the son of the governor and is quite incompetent. Using their relatively well optimized machine learning algorithm, stolen from a silly professor at Stanford, whom they had the foresight to kill, the enemy can predict with a 50 percent accuracy where the tornadoes will strike. The strike happens just as the tornadoes mops through the city. Ten large army helicopters bring the strike team with all the tools at the outskirts of the city, where the tornado won't touch down, and do the damage as follows. They destroy the statue of the most revered historical figure in town, they shoot rockets in the Shopping Mall, they smear with radioactive waste the entrances to the main bank buildings. Then they ride back their motorcycles to the helicopters and leave in full glory. At all times during the attack, the storm watchers give the attackers the information on how to stay out of the tornado's way. You could imagine a similar scenario with an earthquake. Only this time the ground attack can be replaced by some nice carpet bombing. It's harder to argue that a supercomputer gathering seismic data would ever predict earthquakes, but another group at UCLA works on such a grant offered by a mysterious organization (the enemy). The enemy uses data to predict earthquakes and speculate on the stock market. They attack the afflicted areas only to destroy food and fresh water supply with the thought to make those people refugees. They come dressed as FEMA guys hell bent on making their country great. 

You've already followed one naming convention from your own culture: both your female names end in . While not all English female names end in , virtually no male names do (and indeed is commonly added to male names to mke a female equivalent.) Others have mentioned the endings on surnames that refer to the person's father or ancestor: in English, in Spanish or in Russian (Russian surnames change according to the gender of the person, and again we see the addition of to make the female form.) But I think you were more interested in given names, so I will consider that. In Chinese families, it is common for cousins of the same gender and generation to have similar given names. Thus all my (singaporean) ex girlfriend's cousins where called something (female) or something (male.) But the one factor which could cause a whole country to have a common feature in their names is religion. In Spanish the first name Maria is so common that most women called Maria go by their second name (the initial Maria often get abbreviated to in email signatures and similar uses.) There are many Spanish female names that refer to some aspect of Mary, even though they sound nothing like Mary. Lourdes and Carmen (named after holy places) and Angeles (short for Maria de los Angeles) are examples. I understand the Franco dictatorship made it obligatory for all girls to be named after Mary in some way or other, but I can't confirm this. For male names, I've heard more than once that Mohamed is the most common male name in the world, and I can believe it. Hebrew names for both genders (both those that are in current use and those that now sound old fashioned) often contain meaning God: Daniel, Michael, Joel, Ezekiel, Elijah, Elishaveh (Elizabeth), Eliana, Batel, etc. 

I don't really know how you would get hydrochloric acid from a natural phenomenon. But, if you are a god, you get it from somewhere and put it in a cloud floating above your offending town. Assuming its buildings are made of rocks, they would melt if enough acid rains upon them. People would probably die from fumes in the first few minutes of your heavy acid rain. Oxides and salts in the rocks would react to the strong acid. Once you had enough of it, throw some lightning bolts on the ground. 

Why go to casinos? You can put all your money into FOREX, fool around with their system for half a day, and become richer than your wildest dream. Or, do online betting. You can pick the most important sports event of the day, predict in when your favorite team will score and win a ton of money. Another way, and much more to my liking, is to go to a chemistry lab, enter the first door on the right and start talking to people who are trying to synthesize the first room temperature superconductor. Play the luck game by telling them what should they mix and in what quantity, and create that magic material. Then write the patent with your new friends and sell it for a few billions. 

With increasing temperature, we get increasing disorder, so it would be very strange for a substance to solidify with increasing temperature (unless water vapour or or other liquid is driven off as mentioned by Kingledion.) However such substances do exist, as mentioned by Mrkvicka. Similarly, and equally counterintuitively, ice gets denser when it melts. The thing that must increase as temperature increases is disorder. In the case of the density of water/ice, it just so happens that ice's most ordered structure has a lot of empty space in it, which explains why it is less dense than the more disordered liquid form of water. As you asked for an "element" or alloy that solidifies when heated, it is worth mentioning pure sulphur, which comes close, in a way. It has a vast increase in viscosity as it is warmed. It starts off as an ordered crystalline solid of S8 rings, which melts into a runny liquid of S8 rings. At a certain temperature, these ordered rings break open and a highly viscous polymer develops, with lots of different chain lengths. On further heating, this breaks down into a runny liquid of formula S2 and finally into gas. Mrkvicka's example is similar in that molecules have an ordered sysem of intramolecular hydrogen bonding at low temperature, which becomes a disordered system of intermolecular hydrogen boning at high temperature. However there are also big differences: In Mrkvicka's example I understand the ring itself is not disturbed, and the bonds broken are hydrogen bonds rather than covalent bonds. Another interesting and counterintuitive property is found in sulphur produced by the desulphurization process of the oil industry, which has hydrogen sulphide dissolved in it. The hydrogen sulphide caps the polymeric chains, so this sulphur does not become viscous like pure sulphur. But what is interesting is that when it cools and forms a more ordered structure of S8 rings, it expels the hydrogen sulphide. Thus it "boils" when the temperature is reduced! All the transformations mentioned here are reversible which I assume is what you are looking for. Unfortunately, these properties are due to the molecular nature of the substance, so as metals do not generally form molecules it would be much less likely to find such properties in a metal. That said, it is concievable that a zintl phase could have the properties you are looking for at some temperature range. These are compounds containing positively charged alkali metal ions and negatively charged ions consisting of clusters of silicon, tin or lead atoms. Being ionically bonded they are not conductive in the solid state. It is not out of the question that there could exist a zintl phase where heating to some (very high) temperature could cause the molecular negative ions to break down into a more disordered polymeric state. But the atoms in negative ions are not behaving like "metals" so to call this an "alloy" would be a bit of a stretch. $URL$ 

I could go on, but I think the technologies needed to make a lasting empire all belong to the category of population discipline. Law and order, plus organization. And lots of pro-empire propaganda built into the educational system. Those could slowly increase your empire, and could even get it to last for a very long time, until population density increases enough, and novel technologies are invented. But, your Roman Empire would probably never extend much beyond the size of the one in history because of the poor transportation and low population density. When those are solved, other empires would have formed and yours would have to fight them to extend. Even with modern day technology we still can't have a single global state. It might be that our civilization will collapse before that ever happens. 

T-Rex would be good in special missions. For example, counter terrorism. You have a building and the enemy is holed in it, and your T-Rex private can break doors, walls and help the other troops get in. Or, you could send a negotiator T-Rex to your terrorists holding hostages. Once it gets in, your negotiator turns into T-Rex and starts chomping on terrorists. Terrorists won't know what's going on, and they'd be too busy shooting at the dinosaur to kill the hostages first. Another great use for T-Rex soldiers is assassination missions. You get your spy close to the enemy leader, he turns into a T-Rex, bites the enemy's head off, then turns into a naked dude with PTSD. Breaking off protests is also an interesting use of T-Rexes. When the citizens in your capital protest against the government selling, yet again, your country's forests to Austrian evil billionaire, instead of police, you release the godzilla-boys into the crowd. They kill as many as they want and the protesters will know next time that it's government who owns people, not the other way around. It goes without saying that T-Rex soldiers would be great for ethnic cleansing. The international community would be ready to believe, for the correct price, that jungle beasts, fed up with the loss of habitat, took revenge on the minorities, for it is known that in every country, if things are bad, it is because of the groups who lack the numbers to defend themselves. The numerous photos and videos on facebook would document this. The National Guard will show up to deal with the threat, and will shell the area, until the houses of the offending minority would be all but destroyed, and people who did not take the hint would be killed. 

Firstly, Lerite sounds like a mineral, not an element, so I think if you are going to invent an element you should give it a more appropriate name. Some elements have more than one name (columbium is now called niobium for example) so it could be an existing element. Dysprosium (element 66) has been mentioned in another answer, but I don't see it as particularly significant. All the Lanthanide series are quite rare, but Samarium (element 62) is used in powerful samarium cobalt magnets. If you're looking for an element with weird properties, try Technetium, element 43. Despite its fairly low atomic number, it has no stable isotopes so it must always be prepared from other elements and is highly radioactive. Similar levels of instability aren't seen again until you get past Lead (element 82.) You could handwave a stable form of technetium, I suppose, though it's not physically possible. The other possiblility is a compound or composite. If you want to call it lerite, it could be a mineral like Superman's kryptonite. There are many minerals formed of very mundane elements that have very distinctive properties: lapis lazuli / lazurite, opals, zeolites, and asbestos to name a few. If you want to invent something new that is magnetic, it could be an organic compound, either synthesized by humans or other inteligent life, or by biological processes. for example you can have "plastic magnets". There are microbes that swim in a certain direction according to magnetic fields, and no-one knows how they do it. 

I don't get how no one thought of Feynman's lectures. There is 0 chance that someone taking Jackson's book for the first time will ever piece together the Electrodynamics again, not knowing other physics than the one contained in other two seminal books. Feynman's lectures are easier to follow and they have been the inspiration for many fledgling physicists. I would probably vote for writing 3 such books, just as the Bible was written to help preserve the religion over many generations. The books have to contain a thorough discussion of the scientific method, the basics of mechanics, astronomy, relativity, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and general relativity, etc. They should also discuss incomplete or not sufficiently verified theories and point to the edge of the current human knowledge. 

How about forgetting architecture and putting your city on a lava dome? You could pick a dome like this one in Andes, and excavate by magic (or just very advanced mining) below it to form your cave. It should hold, because you have hundreds of meters of volcanic rock above your cave. There are huge cave chambers such as Sarawak Chamber which is 600x435 meters. If the cave ceiling is arched, there is a good chance it could be bigger. 

Aliens would have an entirely different physiology and would almost certainly be immune to human viruses, which have specifically evolved to reproduce in a human cell. (On the other hand, simple bacteria and parasites might prove deadly to the aliens.) So if theres a wave of alien abductions, they're probably taking people to use a guinea pigs to breed and incubate the ultimate strain of smallpox. Although the disease has currently been eradicated, we shouldn't get complacent and stop vaccinating, because when aliens attack we're doomed. $URL$ $URL$ Note that smallpox played a major role in the conquest of the Americas. The Europeans brought smallpox with them, and the natives, having had no contact with the disease, were decimated. (In return, it is believed the Native Americans probably gave the Europeans syphilis.) 

Use the normal metabolism. It is unlikely that it would be possible to build up high pressures of CO2 in this way, though, without making the blood too acidic. Use CO2 from her fire breath, if any. This would be highly inefficient, and would again have the problem of generating CO2 at ambient Go to a frozen wasteland and eat CO2 Eat chalk, and use this to generate CO2, through the reaction CaCO3 + Acid = Ca salt + CO2. The acid could come from normal metabolism. As for 4, except the acid comes from an external source. For example, the dragon may go to a volcano and feast on brimstone (sulphur) which she could then burn (producing fiery breath without the inconvenience of having to generate large amounts of fuel through metabolism.) When she is not breathing fire, the dragon may slowly convert the sulphur to SO3 and H2SO4 in her belly, and react these with chalk to make CO2 under pressure. This is an entirely realistic way for a dragon to produce icy breath without metabolism or mechanical engineering issues. The only remaining issue is materials, which have always been a problem with fire-breathing dragons anyway.
