The word "concrete" in English is a bit troublesome. The word refers to something called "portland cement" that was invented in the modern era in Portland. I'm aware that the following sources don't directly address the Indian subcontinent; I'm providing them to assist your preliminary research. A simple google search on concrete and India returns multiple results. 

I am not an expert on the Mongols, but what you describe seems similar to the Irish Tain Bo Cualinge, or the Norse Viking around the period of the Great Heathen Army (that's not the best reference, but it is the one I could find quickly - I'm thinking more of Rollo, and possibly of the Normans in Sicily (I think there is a podcast by Lars Brownnworth, but I can't remember) Essentially in premodern societies, relations with external groups were very fluid; depending on relative wealth, prosperity and population, they could be partners in trade, or targets of raid. This was normal behavior. OP insightfully points out that this behavior is "pre-nationalism". All of the cited societies are not "nations". That observation is completely in line with my reading of Fukuyama. Not my field of study, but it seems to me that one of the characteristics of Nationalism is the establishment of a "foreign policy". A stronger sense of internal identity facilitates a desire for consistent and coherent external relations. Not sure how I'd test that theory, but I'm confident that H:SE will point out what I've missed. My personal theory is that we're seeing a consequence of shifting internal factions in a society that is at the limit of the ability of the political institutions to create and manage a group, but I have no evidence for that. 

December 2012 BBC History magazine contains an article that analyzes popular support for Benito Mussolini. In passing the article mentions a widespread perception on the part of Italians that liberal government had utterly failed. Fascisim saved them from the obscurity and humiliation to which liberalism would have doomed them. I suspect that the conditions that led to the perception that liberal democracy had failed also contributed to Italy's inability to project power on the world stage. I don't have sufficient scholarship to make the case, but I suspect that the first generation after unification set the stage for divergence between Germany and Italy. Germany under Bismarck developed a vigorous central state that opposed democracy. Italy pursued a more liberal democratic course: 

I'm not sure what you're thinking of when you think of Slaves fighting Masters, but that kind of fight doesn't happen in the real world. In order for any conflict between slaves and masters to last longer than a night or to escalate beyond a single plantation the master's have to be drunken keystone cops - and all plots that rely on the stupidity of the opponents are intrinsically doomed. Someone will probably point out the Boxer rebellion as a counter-example, but the Boxer rebellion (a) had communications, (b) had institutions, and (c) failed. I think the more relevant example - and I forget the name - is when a single European regiment defeated China. That was an example of superior professional military discipline opposed against a corrupt government relying on untrained, unmotivated troops who routed before conflict. THe only thing the slaves had going was motivation (and not much of that). I think it is a disservice to the enslaved to pretend that they could have defeated the South if only they had tried. That claim ignores the scientific brutality of American chattel slavery. 

Mmerchants were quite literally weren't important enough to include in the list. I don't know the % of the European economy involved in commerce in the medieval world (If you do, please note in comments), but I'd bet it was less than 1%. I think this is covered in Mike Duncan's excellent podcast Those who prayed wanted money to advance salvation - to endow religious services, endow religious institutions, to sponsor works of art that glorified God, to propagate the faith, to perform acts of charity and to carry out the mission of those who pray. Money was a tool to an end. Salvation was important; money was merely a tool to accomplish the end. Those who fought wanted decent arms, decent armor, good horses, logistics, allies and all the other things that led to victory in war. The goal wasn't to accumulate wealth per se - it was to ensure that you, your family, and your feudal obligations were safe and had enough to ensure that the next generation was safe and secure. Those who worked were, by and large, unaware of money. They paid their taxes in kind, and most of them never held a shilling. They were probably deeply suspicious of anyone who could rub two shillings together - because such people were different, and all humans know that "different" is merely a synonym for "evil". Good people are like us; different people are evil. Some of the men are Jews, some of them are Muslims, some of them are people from a different village, some of them are people who open their egg from the opposite end that we do. The only way to be safe is to kill anyone different from you, and if you can't kill them, flee from them. People didn't hate Jews because they had money; they hated Jews because humans hate anyone who is different. The fact that Christians were forbidden to practice usury meant that people who practiced usury were not Christians; they are different, and ipso facto, baby eating villains. They did hate Jews because Jews wanted to collect on the money that was owed them - see earlier hyperbole - those who remind me of things that inconvenient to me bathe in blood. Tongue in cheek, but I hope I've offered enough resources for you to find some more coherent answers. 

Google to the rescue Depends on when you ask. Initially they were all male, but the government deployed incentives for women to move in. If you want to know a specific number, you'll probably have to specify a specific date. 

I think a simple google search will reveal the answer. There is a fairly detailed answer at Ask A Linguist; this is particularly nice because it examines some of the issues that make the question difficult to answer. Either Sumerian or Egyptian is the oldest written form, and that the answer for spoken languages is undefined. Yahoo takes a different approach to the question of written languages, and I think their answer is splendid. "All spoken languages today are equally old." The author also notes that Egyptian competes with Sumerian for the title of oldest written language. Wikipedia concentrates on written sources and asserts Sumerian. 

Kudos to @thomasPornin for a decent outline, but I think the answer is broader than that. As I said above, I think the answer is that the Jews do not merit the abuse they've suffered, but I think it may be helpful to outline a few more answers. 

You might want to reivew the history of the NATO alliance, Charles De Gaulle, and the special relationship. In particular 

Nothing would prevent that; it is common. One term for this is to Lie Doggo and there are some examples referenced in the wiktionary article on the term. I'm not sure how one distinguishes "faking death" from "hiding". Here is another example 

Wikipedia citing Shlaes The US government pursued other policies that numbed the economy and the modern mind. For example, prosecuting illiterate immigrants for the crime of selecting their own chickens rather than accepting the chicken that the government had decided they should receive. Taking that case to the supreme court qualifies as a microeconmic policy which is guaranteed to arrest growth. No sane individual is going to want to take out a loan to start a business if they can't permit the customer to choose their goods. Did the US government prolong the depression through primitive, bizarre and uninformed macroeconomic policies? Yes, absolutely. Having said that, remember that John Maynard Keynes hadn't yet written the seminal work on macroeconomic policy. And no matter what flaws I ascribe to Roosevelt, the opposition didn't have a solution that worked any better. The US government, like all governments, assumed that the future would be dominated by planned, centralized economies. They assumed that central government control of demand was the only resolution to any macroeconomic problem. And their assumption seemed to be true. The New Deal was a demand stimulus, and the ultimate resolution to the economic economic crisis was driven by centrally planned demand (a war). But I align with those modern economists who believe that the crisis would have been shorter and less severe if the government had employed monetary policy, eased liquidity, and stimulated growth, rather than avoiding monetary policy, restricting liquidity, and intimidating growth. As I said at the beginning, I'm not trying to hide my bias; the best you can hope is that Mr. Russell will provide an opposing viewpoint. 

Returning to the question - the tax rate you paid depended on when you lived, your social relationship with the tax collector, and a host of other factors. In the period cited in the article (circa 66 AD), taxation was by tax farming. I suspect that anyone who would rather be subjected to tax farming than US Taxation is relying on their skill in evading taxes. No matter what accusations are levied against the IRS, they are less abusive than tax farmers. It would be interesting to ask a Marxist historian to analyze tax farming and exchange entitlements; might be one place where the Marxists and the Libertarians would align (They would also argue ferociously against the notion that they align). 

tl;dr Slavery and state's rights were an existential issue for the South; they could no longer contemplate "compromise" or "moderation". From before the foundation of the Republic, there was an existential tension between the Southern vision of the future and the Northern vision of the future. The only thing keeping them together was the desire to be independent and the leadership of politicians. Their positions on slavery and states rights diverged even more sharply in the pre-war period. From the South's point of view, there was no such thing as a moderate anti-slavery position. They believed that slavery was culturally and economically vital to their existence; they believed that the North would continue to undermine and eliminate their peculiar and essential institution. More importantly than that, if the North demanded to control the South to the extent of destroying this institution, then there was no limit to what the North would do. From the South's point of view, "moderate anti-slavery" was like "a moderate bit of cyanide" - on existential issues, one cannot be moderate. 

OP should also read the section on Purges, or the book Is Paris Burning?, which discusses the post war purges in some detail. In short the French were human, and demonstrated the normal human desires for vengeance. 

"dead credit" isn't a concept, it is a metaphor. See the notes: "Verse commentary in Polish presents mourning over the personalized credit (buying on credit I warn you, do not go anywhere without money - Przestrzegam was nie chodźcie nigdzie bez pieniędzy):" The community are mourning the loss of credit. I'm not sure what event caused them to lose credit privileges, but the cartoon is treating death as a metaphor for loss. There is also an obvious, irreverent reference to the Lamentation over the dead Christ. 

Based on those two principles, I can answer without research. Bottom line I believe based on my reading that every human will be more economically efficient if they own the marginal product of their labor (extra labor results in extra wealth). I haven't yet discovered any example of a culture where slavery is more efficient than freedom. Let's dive down into some examples - because this is a very broad brush survey answer, I'm not going to provide the level of sources/research that I believe is necessary for H:SE Conquest slavery Frequently slavery was the result of conquest. An individual captured in war agreed to give up civil rights and liberty in exchange for life. Sometimes the slave could be freed after a period of servitude - sometimes the individual would expect to become a part of the society once freed. Although the individual labored, there was no expectation that this labor would be "economically efficient" - it was just more profitable than killing the man. Roman Slavery Roman slavery took two distinct forms. Urban Roman Slavery In towns and cities slaves were economic units. Some were born to slavery, others were sold into slavery, others sold themselves into slavery. Many were taken in war. Roman slaves had some legal status, (although sometimes that legal status derived from their status as property - it is a crime to damage another man's property). They could own property, could buy their freedom, and when they were freed, were considered a member of their (ex) owner's household and clientele. Rural Roman Slavery Rural Roman slaves were, not to put too fine a point on it, beasts. They farmed the 'latifundia' and were either working or shut up in barracks. Everything I've heard about the latifundia suggests to me that this is the nadir of humanity, and only possible because they were out of view. This was perceived at the time as the optimum economic efficiency because the absolute minimum was spent on their maintenance, and they were driven to produce output. Feudalism I'm going to over-generalize here, but most of the rest of humanity in the Roman/Greek was in some form of slavery. Slavery doesn't have a strict formal definitions, but civil rights were a consequence of either (a) the military or governance power to assert a civil right - e.g. the aristocracy, or (b) derivative of a member of the aristocracy. Assume that < 10% are aristocrats with the weapons, nutrition, experience and ability to defend themselves. Everyone else was to some extent a slave - they relied on the aristocrats to grant and protect their civil rights. Yes, I'm overgeneralizing. Your lord determined what you did, what you earned, what you kept out of what you earned, whether you married, whether you lived or died, whether you were guilty of civil and criminal offenses. In most cases, you had no recourse and no appeal. You also had no chance to change your status. Again, I'm painting in very broad strokes here - my point is not to argue that I'm depicting history accurately, but rather to point out that the difference between a "serf" and a "peasant" and a "slave" is less clear than many people think. Was that economically efficient? It was the only system they had. I would argue that slavery is always less efficient than freedom, and that any man will produce more when working for his own interests rather than a masters. Feudalism included a set of conventions & customs that ensured that the marginal value generated by additional effort was shared between the individual and the master/lord/ruler. Final thought - this is a sensitive subject and I really dislike painting with this broad a brush. I don't think I've put my foot in my mouth and offended anyone; it was not my intent. But when dealing with oppression, there is always the chance that I'll screw up; if I do, please provide constructive feedback.
