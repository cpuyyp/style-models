This will depend on the part of the world you are in and the preferences of your friend. Based on your profile, I'm inferring that you're in the United States. Generally, in the US, people don't use the title "Dr." unless they are referring to a medical doctor. If you were in Germany, on the other hand, people tend to get offended if you omit a title. Unless your friend has expressed a preference that he be referred to with a title (which would generally be considered a bit pompous in the US but hardly unheard of), you would generally just use his name. Hopefully, of course, someone in the interview will tell you the proper form of address by using his name first either by introducing you two (i.e. "And you know Dr. Smith/ Joe, I believe") if he's going to be in the interview or by referring to him in conversation. If they do, it would make sense to follow their lead. 

Being local certainly tends to help. Putting a local address on your resume might help get past a very early screen but is likely to backfire if you're not actually local. A local address on a resume generally implies that the recruiting process is going to be easier. The company can, for example, expect to schedule an on-site interview relatively easily and without needing to arrange flights, hotels, transportation, and everything else that comes with setting up interviews with folks from out of town. They can have a couple rounds of in-person interviews rather than needing to coordinate everyone's schedules. The company can expect that you'll likely be available to start relatively soon since you just have to put in your notice rather than needing to put in notice and then coordinate a cross-country move that likely involves spending a reasonable amount of time looking for housing and things of that nature. If your resume shows a local address but when the company calls to schedule a meeting you mention that you're across the country, that's not going to leave a great impression. If a hiring manager gets a great resume from someone from out of town, particularly for a software developer in Silicon Valley, they can get the appropriate people to sign off on paying for travel before reaching out to the candidate to schedule a time. Depending on the company, they may want to talk with at least the first batch of local candidates before they start flying people in. If the hiring manager reaches out to the candidate and then gets blind-sided that they need to arrange a bunch of travel, that can lead to a bunch of headaches and a sour taste in their mouth. With some justification, the hiring manager is likely to think that you're at least somewhat deceptive as well which is never a good way to start off a relationship. 

It really doesn't matter whether the extra duties were originally done by other people or in other companies. If you have an employment contract and the duties are sufficiently different from your core responsibilities, it is possible that there would be some verbiage there that you could leverage. But in the vast majority of cases, the duties would be reasonable "other duties as assigned" from the employment contract or there is no contract in place. So your employer can almost certainly instruct you to do the additional work. As your responsibilities grow, it is certainly reasonable to consider whether it would be appropriate to ask for a raise. If you were hired to do the accounting for one company and you're now doing the accounting for 10 companies, it's certainly reasonable to expect that you should be compensated for that. Of course, the fact that a bunch of people quitting haven't been backfilled with new hires may indicate that the company is having financial problems that would prevent it from giving raises. Since this is tagged "time management" and "burnout", if your real issue is that you're being asked to do more hours than you signed up for (or than you're being paid for), it is entirely reasonable to bring that up to your manager. If you signed up for a salaried position that would be expected to require 40 hours a week most weeks with the occasional busy week and now you're spending 60 hours a week working in a good week, it is entirely reasonable to ask your boss to help you prioritize the work so that you can get back down to a reasonable number of hours. For that discussion, it would be helpful to figure out roughly how many hours you're currently spending on your different tasks along with any options you have to reduce that time. If there are tasks that other people could reasonably do or tasks that could be automated or tasks that you could reasonably stop doing, I'd definitely bring that up at the meeting. 

I'm hard-pressed to come up with many cases where someone would be upset that a colleague took the time to add a nice recommendation to their LinkedIn profile. Barring the odd case where the recommendation is so poorly written or so poorly targeted to the skills the individual wants to demonstrate, in which case LinkedIn allows them to hide the recommendation, your colleague would almost certainly be grateful that you took the time to recommend him or her. Particularly when your recommendation is genuine as opposed to the many recommendations that occur when A recommends B at the same time that B recommends A because both want to improve their profile. 

Presumably, you are trying to determine how likely it is that you will be working with smart people if you take the job. Plenty of large software companies that hire large numbers of really smart people have individual groups and divisions populated by mediocre developers, after all. Going by the size and/or reputation of the company is a relatively poor way to determine this. It makes far more sense to ask the interviewer about the development environment (source control, build management, etc.) and about the particular software that the group you'd be working in develops. Most interviewers will be quite happy to do things like diagram the data flows of the product you'd be working on, discuss the high-level architecture, or discuss how various technologies are used in addition to answering basic questions about how source code is controlled and how builds are managed. This sort of architecture discussion tends to be much more illuminating about the type of work you're likely to be doing than would the interviewer's explanation of how to reverse a linked list. You can see whether the types of problems you are going to be asked to solve are likely to be problems you'll find interesting, whether the match of technologies and architectural approaches makes sense to you, etc. And you can more easily drill down into areas of concern (i.e. "Why does it take X hours to do Y?") that can show where the group is likely to have deficiencies. Trying to quiz an interviewer is unlikely to be helpful for you if your intention is to get the job. Even if the interviewer can answer your questions, you'll be taking away from the time they have to determine whether they're completely convinced that you'd be a good hire. And most interviewers are going to be put off by that sort of question. Since there are much better questions that you could be asking about the particular application(s) that you'd be working on, there is really no benefit to trying to ask this sort of trivia question. 

It's unlikely to matter. From the company perspective, if you're a great candidate, they'd prefer that you apply directly since that saves them the commission that would be owed to the recruiter. But that is very unlikely to affect their interest in you. If the company has already decided to work with a recruiter, it isn't going to take a less desirable candidate that happened to apply directly over a more desirable candidate that applied through a recruiter. And it is unlikely to affect you in bargaining-- the hiring manager is unlikely to be able to offer you more money if they don't have to pay a recruiter. It is possible that a recruiter is able to give you more information about the position and what sorts of things the hiring manager is looking for than is available in the job description. Job descriptions are often rather formalized documents where a good recruiter might have had a conversation about how nice the "nice to haves" are, how flexible the hiring manager is about requirements, which requirements have the most flexibility, etc. It's possible that the recruiter would be able to use this to help you sell yourself better. On the whole, though, it is unlikely to matter much. The odds that you get a really good recruiter that helps you enough that it's the difference between getting the job and not getting the job is pretty low. The odds that a recruiter would filter you out when you otherwise would have gotten the job, that the company's HR department would filter you out if you applied directly, or that you'd get some benefit from applying directly are all similarly low. Since you found the job because of the recruiter's post, and assuming that you wouldn't have found the company's listing yourself, I'd say that the recruiter is doing a reasonable job of finding potential candidates and give them the benefit of the doubt. If having a direct contact makes you feel better, applying through the recruiter is perfectly reasonable. But there would be no harm in applying directly. 

Are these emails going to a mailing list? If so, put in a request to whoever manages mailing lists in your organization to be added to the list. Or is some human entering a bunch of email addresses and just forgetting you? If so, tell them that there's a problem. Particularly if they have configured an alias in their personal address book that goes to "everyone", they are unlikely to notice that they've omitted you. When you find out that you need to follow up on an email that you never received, it's always reasonable to follow up with whoever sent the email to let them know that you were left out of the distribution. If the sender doesn't know that there is a problem, they can't do anything to fix it or to prevent it from happening again in the future. 

I wouldn't bring it up. To the extent that interviewers are biased against heavier people, it's generally going to be subconscious, subtle, and statistical. Very few people are going to be consciously and intentionally discriminating against heavy folks. And while statistically it's likely to have an impact, it's going to be a small one-- you're almost certainly going to lose out on more jobs than you land and the vast majority of rejections are going to be for other reasons. Some small fraction of rejections will be the result of weight discrimination but it's likely that the interviewer didn't even realize they were discriminating at the time. If you tried to bring it up, you'd probably only succeed in leading the interviewer to feel that you're preemptively accusing them of discrimination. Plus you'd be bringing up bunch of information that the interviewer really doesn't want to have (a health condition that from your description seems to have no impact on your ability to do the job, a medication regime, side-effects, etc.). That would likely be far more concerning to an interviewer than a subtle weight bias. By all means feel free to emphasize things like self-discipline in answering questions if you're concerned that someone might be judging you for your appearance. If you're confident in your abilities and comfortable in your own skin, that's likely to be as much as you can do. Do whatever it takes for you to feel confident and comfortable. As @bethlakshmi points out, that likely means dressing well which may involve buying some new clothes that present the current you in a more flattering light.
