We want to establish its truth value over this domain, ie x & y are both drawn from the domain D. Now x is bound to A (ie All) first; and y is bound to E (ie There Exists) second (you read bindings from right to left, it matters which direction you read them from and we read them right to left because that is how well-formed formulas are built up in formal grammars). So the formula reads in English 

ZFC is the mainstream set theory. It has an axiom of infinity which claims that there is at least one infinite set. Now suppose like Aristotle, we object and say that there are no actually infinites in nature, only potentially infinite ones, and so we decide to drop the axiom of infinity, presumably this means that we must drop the axiom of Choice as this becomes irrelevant when there are no infinite sets to work with. Presumably no other essential modifications need to be made to any other axioms - but considering the answer to this question perhaps one needs an axiom to assert the existence of the empty set. Now is this fragment of ZFC - which is a theory of finite sets - provably consistent? Or is it likely, that it still embeds PA, and thus Godels incompleteness theorem applies? 

Not really an answer, but some comments: Archaic Physics The speed of light in Relativity is seen as a maximal speed that a massless object can travel at in the vacuum; in fact it must travel at this speed. A massless object doesn't interact with the gravitational field; so one can say that it feels no 'resistance'. Interestingly this is reminiscent of an argument in Aristotles Physics, which is probably due to the atomists that bodies in the Void (not as Non-Being but privation of Body, or perhaps as a Continua of Places) must all travel at the same speed as they do not feel any resistance. Theoretically, one can consider that the speed of light as a barrier through which particles cannot pass through; this so that causality isn't violated. Thus superluminal particles have been investigated. Tachyons Feinberg proposed a model of these that had negative energy, and imaginary mass which he called tachyons; but in fact these fields were later understood as not permitting superluminal speeds; and represent an instability important in the mechanism of the Higgs field; and in fact this field is a tachyon, so has imaginary mass and negative energy; at least at first, the instability 'condenses' and then the field is no longer tachyonic. Another way to investigate super-luminal particles in a sense, is to allow c to vary; and I recall very vaguely possibilities where these were linked to ideas of inflation - c varies with time; another interesting angle is to have the Plank length as an observer invariant; one theory along these lines is by Maguijo/Smolin, called doubly-special relativity. 

Facts cannot make a man either happy, or unhappy - they are the case. It must lie outside of the world: 

In 1993, Karen Harding, a philosopher wrote a paper, Causality then and now: Al-Ghazali and QM. She remarked: 

How else would you experience the world? Is the color red itself the same as the word 'red'? Of course we use words to describe our experience to others. One could examine the world out there as logos by Christianity, a system of signs by semiotics in European philosohy as inspired by linguistics or information as modern physics - but this is language of an entirely different order and amongst themselves are not commensurate. In this sense no-one escapes language in their structuring of experience. 

Its not a paradox: Plenty of children when they first learn arithmetic know that 1+1=2 is true, but they don't understand why. They have simply learnt it as as a piece of formal knowledge - parrot fashion (and note that no-one thinks a parrot repeating phrases in the English language understands English); hence one should not call this knowledge (though it is knowledge of a certain kind); when they understand why, it then becomes proper knowledge; one might say that this is a kind of justified true knowledge - that is knowledge with an account as to why its true. However, its also acceptable to say that 'if I know something, then I know I know this'; and in fact this statement becomes an axiom in the axiomatic formulation of epistemology that is known as epistemic logic - but note that logicians generally acknowledge that it only captures certain aspects of epistemology; one can't really say that epistemology has been reduced to a logic; this is of course typical of all foralisations. In Suhrawardis philosophy of Illuminationism (Ishraq) true knowledge is that which becomes 'visible' or 'illuminated'; (his theory goes much further than this as it is also a theory of ontology); this form of knowledge which is intuitive, immediate and atemporal is contrasted against that of cognitive reason (aql); in this theory, someone who cognitively understands the formal rules of manipulation of arithmetic does not neccessarily have intuitive knowledge - that is true knowledge. There are obvious parallels here with Descarte who held that we could be sure of an idea when we had a 'clear and distinct' notion of it. 

Mathematicians have only become fond of infinity after Cantor; this is a relatively recent innovation; still one can say that the mathematical infinite differs in important ways from the philosophical infinite. When Spinoza for example talks about an infinite substance its quite clear that there is no fundamental relation between this and any conception of cardinality. It was Aristotle that smuggled in the LEM into philosophy; and it has remained there. It was Brouwer in mathematics and Hegel in Philosophy that reintroduced it; for Brouwer it led to intuitionism; for Hegel it led to the dialectic. Given the apparatus of formal logic, it is usually taken that a contradiction will allow one to prove anything: the principle of explosion - ex falso quodlibet; a question then introduces itself: can one deny this principle by changing the formal structure of the logic? This is indeed possible as the Peruvian Philosopher Quesado showed. Brouwers Intuitionism also known as Constructivism was put on a formal basis by his student Heyting. There is a correspondance between Boolean algebras and propositional logic; similarly there is one between Heyting Algebra and intuitionistic logic. Formally, Boolean algebras are exactly bounded distributed lattices that are complemented. Their models (ie semantics) are fields of sets (set theoretically) or Venn diagrams (geometrically). Correspondingly, Heyting algebras are exactly bounded distributive lattice with an additional implication operation which satisfies: x and a is 'less true' then b iff a is 'less true' than x implies b. Further their models are toposes (set theoretically) or topological spaces (geometrically). Heyting algebras generalise Boolean algebras since the ones that satisfy the LEM are exactly the Boolean Algebras. In their set theoretic avatar, we can say toposes are set theory when it loses the notion of an element (which may be difficult to comprehend - the canonical book here is Lawveres Sets for Mathematicans); and geometrically when topological spaces lose their points ( this may be easier to understand as typically we consider a space of points together with its space of open sets; one then need only 'forget' the points). Note: All operations are fully defined. Philosophically: Contra Leibniz, taking properties of points not to include their location; we can consider the atomic point to be a bare point; one without any distinguishing features. This has been the norm since Descarte; forgetting points amounts to, in one sense, of having atomic points with structure, this is more inline with the Epicurean notion of an atom; and has had a contemporary impact in Physics: String Theory - a string is an atomic point with structure; secondly, it amounts to a relational view of space as there are no 'absolute points' to anchor to; this is a synthesis of Leibnizs view and Aristotle who denied the existence of points in the continuum and relied on cohesion (ie topology in modern language). 

Descartes notion of the subject is self-subsistent: the self reflecting on itself finds itself. The Lacanian mirror appears to introduce an other to find the self - his notion of the subject appears to be relational rather than the atomic (as in Descarte) - is this correct? And is it also correct to position the Lacanian subject in opposition to the Descartian one? 

How about impossible? However... Borges, the Argentinian writer in short story The Library of Babel, wrote that any proposition in some system of thought may be true. This is his library of thought, or of worlds. In model theory which is the mathematical investigation of truth & proofs in formal systems there are what are called undecidable propositions - that is propositions which are true but cannot be formally proved so. One way to look at this is that in some worlds it can be proved true, and in other worlds it will be proved false; so generally, that is formally it isn't provable. This means, in this architecture of truth & proof, a provably false propositon is one that is false in all models - that is in no model can it be true. False propositions, like the flat-earth theory can also have significant truth value when looked at the right way. For example, we can say that the Earth looks flat wherever you are on the Earth, and given the actual physical landscape this is actually an abstract thought of a kind. Notably, it is this definition which is used in the mathematical discipline of manifold theory whose most famous application is in Einsteins theory of Gravity. So, although, some people dismissively say that flat space was proved wrong by Einstein, a more subtle understanding is that it became a local segment of the theory. In Hegelian discourse, thought is a process and not a proposition. A given proposition gives rises to its opposite and are then sublated in a synthesis. No proposition is wholly true, nor wholly false, but must seen in a context of every increasing sophistication. So Truth is not simply a binary affair of true & false, that is the very categories of thought - true & false are false - or properly partly true & partly false. In Jain Logic, some propositions, are false and indescribable, or true and indescribable. One might suppose for example, Negative Theology, which describes God by what he is not, because by being an Infinite Being any description is naturally not wholly true; one might say He is true but indescribable. This is part of a system of Jain thought called Anekantavada which means objective knowledge can only be obtained by Kevalis who see objects in all aspects & all manifestations. One might suppose a proposition that exhibited itself as a contradiction must be false. For example, '0 is 1', or 'grass is not grass'. But this can be argued against, simply by seeking some context where it is true; for example the first statement is true in what is called the trivial ring, and the second is not true of a painting of grass. One might argue then, one should include the context explicitly. But this then leads immediately, at least in thought, to an infinite regression. But of course this does not happen in practise - and one could argue that might be one way of understanding or arguing that consciousness is one. 

This is the first speech that identifies the superstructure, the Roman State by Menenius, who as a Patrician, has a name, a specific identity. He is not part of the mob of common plebians. He identifies the laws of heaven with that of the Roman State, whose force and strength is irresistable (cracking ten thousand curbs); the Plebians condition (the dearth) is not the making of the State, he says, but by the gods. The Patricians, are the human face of the super-structure, they care for the plebians like fathers. The political discourse carries on through the first scene, and through the rest of the play... 

Physics relies on the fundamental postulate that the universe follows certain laws, and it just remains to find out exactly what they are. In this sense the universe is rationally explicable. But human beings are in the universe, that is they are njot apart from it. And we know that they have irrational impulses, emotional and intellectual. In this case the universe is not (wholly) rationally explicable, as humans are not.
