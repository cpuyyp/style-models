Ok, I'll try to explain intuitively for the Ramsey model (but it's not rigorous). Suppose that from the first order conditions, you can conclude that the equilibrium is unique and furthermore you can express consumption as a function of capital stock, that is $c_{t} = g(k_t)$, for some (smooth) function $g$. If that is the case, for a given initial capital stock $k_0$, you know how the economy is going to evolve. That is, if we denote the vector of variables by $x_t = (c_t, k_t)$, you know $\{ x_{t}\}_{t=0}^{\infty}$; because $t=0: \quad$ $k_0$ is given, and $c_0 = g(k_0)$, $t=1: \quad$ $k_1 = (1-\delta)k_0 + f(k_0) - c_0$, and $c_1 = g(k_1)$, (here $f$ is the production function and $\delta$ is depreciation) $\vdots $ $t=\tau: \quad$ $k_{\tau} = (1-\delta)k_{\tau -1} + f(k_{\tau -1}) - c_{\tau -1}$, and $c_{\tau} = g(k_{\tau})$, so on .... Now, suppose the economy loses some of its capital stock for some reason while it was on $x^*=(k^*, c^*)$ and the new capital stock is, say, $k_{\tau}$. Where will the economy be with this new capital stock? Well, we have just claimed that there is a corresponding consumption $c_{\tau}=g(k_{\tau})$, and therefore the economy will jump to the point $x_{\tau}=(k_{\tau}, c_{\tau})$ on impact the shock and then move toward back to steady state $x^*$. You can think of $x_{\tau}$ as the red point in the figure. Finally, a few remarks on the intuition behind the mathematical conditions ensuring saddle-path stability. 1) Note that, in the model we have actually two variables $c_t$ and $k_t$, but we have assumed that one of them can be expressed in terms of the other, so the number of free variables is reduced to one, which is $k_t$ here. Basically, in order to be able to do this, you want to have a smooth curve mapping capital stock to consumption, i.e. $g: \mathcal{R} \to \mathcal{R}$ is a smooth curve (1-dimensional manifold). 2) Once the economy is at $x_{1}$ after the shock, you want it go back to $x^*$ and this is related to the number of eigenvalues that are less than one in absolute value. For precise statements (in a general environment) see Acemoglu as I mentioned before. Regarding rational expectations(RE): it is a solution concept and RE alone does not imply saddle-path stability. 

Even in simplest of models I don't think it is enough info to constrain the fx rate. Even if velocity can be worked out we can't get m0. In the simplest model all islanders are equally capable or some equilibrium arises where everyone gets the same proportions of resource. Then if resource x has $a$ units per person and total of all resources or sum of all units of the different resources is $s$ the price of each resource $x$ is simply $\frac{100a}{s}$. If the price of a resource is known in a foreign currency then one can theoretically obtain the foreign currency by selling goods in the foreign currency. In this simple theory any difference in resources would be arbitrage opportunities seeking to balance or distribute resources till they have the same abundance. This is very simple theory. If one resource is short one place and another resource short some where's else there may be no arbitrage and thus do not cancel out. So we assume eventually or in long run of existence of island nation, absent of any kind of trade barriers, there is no more arbitrage. Now we have $$\frac{m_a a}{s_a}=\frac{m_b b}{s_b}$$ Assuming resources eventually are evenly distributed, or even that the ratios of such resources are same, the then we see that one unit of currency equals $1_{unit \ a} =\frac{1_{unit \ b} m_b}{m_a}$. So in this model if islanders have $m_a=100$ and u.s. have $m_b=30000$ then one island currency would be worth $\frac{30000}{100}=300$ USD. So we see a lot of assumptions are made here. Also maybe this is too granular. Probably more needs to be considered about resource pricing. In reality there are different levels of abundance of resource and that is the primary motivating factor here. 

I've been working on it and I believe this is the way to approach it: Write the lotteries as follows: $L_{1}=[(0.89,\$1),(0.11,\$1)]$ $L_{2}=[(0.89,\$1),(0.11,L')]$ where we compound $L'$ inside $L_{2}$ with $L'=[(\frac{1}{11},\$0),(\frac{10}{11},\$5)]$ $L_{3}=[(0.89,\$0),(0.11,L')]$ using the same $L'$ $L_{4}=[(0.89,\$0),(0.11,\$1)]$ We have $L_{1}$ is preferred to $L_{2}$. So, by the assumption of independence or substitutability, changing the lottery value from $(0.89,\$1)$ to $(0.89,\$0)$ with all else remaining constant, should not change our preferences. So, if the assumption is followed, we should have $L_{4}$ is preferred to $L_{3}$. However, $L_{3}$ is preferred to $L_{4}$, so it is not the case. What do you think of this approach? Is it valid? 

Suppose we have the following four lotteries: $L_{1}=[(1,\$1)]$ $L_{2}=[(0.01,\$0),(0.89,\$1),(0.1,\$5)]$ $L_{3}=[(0.9,\$0),(0.1,\$5)]$ $L_{4}=[(0.89,\$0),(0.11,\$1)]$ If our agent says that he prefers $L_{1}$ to $L_{2}$ and prefers $L_{3}$ to $L_{4}$, then he is not following the expected utility assumption of independence (also known as substitutability). Anyone know how to explain this? 

Suppose we have a very elastic supply curve and a very inelastic demand curve. Further suppose there is a decrease in input prices which shifts the supply curve outward. By taking an extreme representation (vertical demand curve and horizontal supply curve), I can see that it will be mainly price that is affected: the equilibrium price decreases while equilibrium quantity hardly changes. How can I show this more intuitively or mathematically? Edit: Just thought about this. I don't think the elasticity of the supply curve matters. Only the elasticity of the curve that isn't shifting does. Is this the answer? 

Suppose you have a dynamic system $$ x_{t+1} = Ax_{t} $$ with a stationary point (or steady state as used in growth or RBC literature), say, $x^*$, i.e. $x^{*} = Ax^{*}$. Now, consider the following question. Starting from an initial value $x_0$, how many paths are there leading to the stationary point $x^*$? If there is an unique path going from $x_{0}$ to $x^{*}$, then your model is well behaved in the sense that you can track the vector of variables, $x_t$, along the transition without worrying which path you are actually on. This is the saddle-path stability case that you are referring to. On the other hand, if the answer is not affirmative, it means that you have at least two routes from $x_0$ to $x^{*}$. There is another case: no matter where you start from you eventually end up at the stationary point $x^{*}$, in which case your model is said to be indeterminate. So you can think of saddle-path stability as a desirable feature that you would like that your model to manifest in order to analyze the problem at hand. For example, standard RBC models all posses this property. There are some mathematical conditions that ensure the saddle-path stability. For the details and more, check out the section 7.8 (The q-Theory Investment and Saddle-Path Stability) in Introduction to Modern Economic Growth (Acemoglu, 2009). 

Suppose we have a Cobb-Douglas utility function: $$U(x,y)=x^\alpha y^\beta$$ and a budget constraint: $$p_{x}x+p_{y}y=I$$ where $\alpha+\beta=1$. It can be shown that the Marshallian demand for $x$ and $y$ is $x^*=\frac{\alpha I}{p_{x}}$ and $y^*=\frac{\beta I}{p_{y}}$ respectively. Does a change in $p_{y}$ affect the quantity of $x$ demanded? By looking at $x$'s Marshallian Demand, it seems as though such a change will not affect the quantity of x demanded but $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$ are related by the budget constraint which makes me not quite sure. 

Thought about a very simple example: Suppose we have two distinct points $(X_{1},Y_{1})$ and $(X_{2},Y_{2})$. The best regression line for these two points would be the line that passes through both points. However, any line passing through $(\frac{X_{1}+X_{2}}{2},\frac{Y_{1}+Y_{2}}{2})$ would let $\hat u_{1}+\hat u_{2}=0$, just like the perfect regression line. 

I am given the following utility function: $u(x_{1}, x_{2})=x_{1}^2x_{2}$ where $x_{1}$ represents leisure and $x_{2}$ represents consumption. I am also given the budget constraint with the price of $x_{2}$ normalized to 1: $w(T-x_{1})=x_{2}$ where $w$ is the wage and $T$ is the number of hours available to the agent. I am asked to derive Marshallian Demands. How am I supposed to interpret this problem? Should I consider $w$ the price of $x_{1}$ since it is the opportunity cost of leisure? If so, then the agent is constrained by both, time and wage. I'm not sure how to go about it. 

There is a relatively simple equation for options price given certain assumptions known as the black schoels equation. According to Wikipedia it is surprising that an options price is completely determined given some variables such as variation of the underlying asset's annual return. Alternatively one can deduce the variation of the asset from options price. I wonder that given now we are forced to exercise the option if things are as simple? (Also I'm simply asking from the same theoretical grounds that B.S. is valid. I don't care at this point about irregularities in real future derivatives, however if one feels they have thoroughly tackled the simpler theoretical grounds in their answer, then feel free to discuss any short comings if compelled.) 

If China starts dumping u.s. currencies it simply raises the yield of bonds. It's happened before and is simply part of bond yield fluctuation. Normally when an institution owns a significant percent of a security and decides to try and reposition itself, it begins to sell the security preferably at some percentage of the daily volume or at a rate that the existing market makers can sustain a given price. The way Treasuries work are that they are for 100 dollars each and they pay periodic coupons which are interest. So a bonds flat value is determined as 100 plus all the coupon payments it will pay yet. If investments are typically earning a lot then under normal circumstances because you have to wait to collect the coupon payments, and to get the 100 back at maturity, (up to 30 years) the bond may sell for under 100 or at discount. So if you bought the bond for 90 dollars you get 10 plus all coupons as yield on it, giving the yield. Today's yields range from 2.7 to 3 percent roughly which is the same even though some bonds are discounted, some premium and have different coupons depending on issuance. Binds are issued at auctions by fed, to primary banks. Bonds are then sold on secondary markets where they very in characteristics but sell and buy at a given yield. If China floods market the bond yield will go up. This is because there aren't enough buyers to sustain given yield, so 100 dollar bond will have to sell for less or at a discount. This means if you buy the bond for under less you get more if you wait for it to mature, thus the yield goes up. As far as I'm aware the sale and demand for bonds on the secondary markets are the primary factor in determining yield on bonds. If the yield is driven up on the secondary then when the fed issues new bonds they will bid higher coupons because they could otherwise buy more competitive bonds on secondary than at auction. Now considering that as far as I'm aware of the bond coupon is the only net faucet of m0 or newly minted currency. It would take up to 30 years for the new credits to be realized however it would have a net result of adding m0 or clean money to the economy mitigating the reliance on m2 which is currency generated from m0 but by banks in the form of loans and tied to interest. Now considering that banks can not know the deposited, loan terms of everyone else, there is nothing to insure that there is even enough free currency available to pay all outstanding loans and interest, thus defaults and bankruptcy could be simply necessary for it all to account. Additional m0 could lower default rate, and have positive benefits. Now considering that China and Japan have large supply of m0 generating bonds while U.S. uses much more costly and difficult m2, it seems to me this would not be likely course of events that bonds are dumped. But this last half I admit is a bit speculative. 

In an open economy, the following equation always holds, it is an identity: $S-I=NX$ where $S-I$ represents net capital outflow and $NX$ represents trade balance (net exports). This equation tells us that there is an inextricable link between the financial markets and the markets for goods and services. But how can we explain it and why is it true, intuitively? 

Suppose we have a production function $f(z)=2$. I am asked to determine whether the function exhibits increasing, decreasing, constant or no returns to scale. For $t>0$, $f(tz)=2$. I'm not sure about the answer: should I say the function exhibits no returns to scale whatsoever or take different values for $t$ ($0<t<1 \implies$decreasing returns to scale, $t=1 \implies$ constant returns to scale, $t>1 \implies$ increasing returns to scale)? 

Suppose we have utility: $$U(x,y)=x^{0.5}y^{0.5}$$ Then Marshallian Demand for good $x$ is: $$x(p_{x},p_{y},I)=\frac{0.5I}{p_{x}}$$ And Hicksian Demand for good $x$ is: $$x^{c}(p_{x},p_{y},U)=p_{x}^{-0.5}p_{y}^{0.5}U$$ If $p_{x}=1$, $p_{y}=4$, $I=8$ and $U=2$: Marshallian Demand for $x$ is 4 and Hicksian Demand for $x$ is 4. Supposing that the price of good $x$ rises to $p_{x}=4$, how can the Slutsky equation show us the change due to substitution effect and income effect? Substitution effect: $\frac{\partial x^c}{\partial p_{x}}=-0.25p_{x}^{-2}I$ according to the Slutsky equation. If we plug in $p_{x}=4$, the result is -0.125. How is that meaningful in any way? The Hicksian Demand should drop from 4 to 2 after this price increase but I don't see how the Slutsky equation shows us that.
