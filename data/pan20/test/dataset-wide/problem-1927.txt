The job is in customer service. You are in a uniform. The place you will be working in is the amusement park. Managers expect all their employees to take pride in making sure their customers have a safe, enjoyable stay at the park. They know that once a level of uncleanliness creeps in some customers will not be comfortable. The expected answer is that you will pick up the trash. As to the answer they are looking for: no idea. They could be using this question with a series of other questions as another way to filter the potential employees. And filter may not be hire/No Hire; it could be uniform/no uniform. The confusing thing is that if the group of applicants was large and the expected answer was for people to raise their hand, they would never know you didn't raise your hand. 

Dropping off your resume when a job doesn't exist will not generally work for many companies because they need a job opening to attach the resume to. Many times they flush all the old resumes from there system after a few months under the assumption they are outdated or out of the market, though some do keep electronic ones longer a a source of contact information. Unless the company is small there is no way to know that HR or the relevant hiring manger will be at that location. If that isn't the right place it is unlikely that the resume will end up in the right place. You will have better luck with a contact that works there or somebody you meet at a university event. 

For more than a decade resumes for an interview have been in the hands of the interviewers in one of these methods. It worked the same way whether I was the interviewer or the candidate. 

The simple answer is to talk to your supervisor at the company. They will know how to address the situation: 

He wants to make a commission. If you know the name of the company then you can apply for the job. They will not pay him, if you are are able to submit your resume directly to the company. He also wants your resume so he can shop your skills to other companies or for other positions. Some will even insist on a softcopy so they can tweak it to match their style or add their company name to the document. Some recruiters have been known to make major modifications to make potential employees look more appealing to postential companies. There is also a chance that the company that has the position doesn't want to identify themselves, but the more likely situation is to save the commission. 

Ask for a meeting to plan your career. If there is no path to a promotion within the company that doesn't require a degree than you have 3 choices: 

Nobody is available to work on tasks for 40 hours every week, or 80 hours every sprint. Nobody. There are some sprints that have holes in them. Sometimes people have vacations and sick leave. Other times they have to perform non-development functions. Other times the entire company has to attend an all hands meeting. Some teams also have to deal with interruptions, where members has to respond to a crisis unrelated to completing the sprint. The server may have crashed, or a zero-day vulnerability discovered. Overtime they learn to plan for x% of the time not being unavailable for some team members. Planned non-availability is covered as early in the sprint planning as possible so that realistic estimates can be done. The fact that the majority of your absences will be known in advance is helpful. What would be better than being unavailable one week a month, would be if it was 1 week out of every four. That way it would be every other sprint, and it could either consistently be early or late in the sprint. The impact of your schedule depends on the size of the team. A two person team is different than a 20 person team. 

Your question implies that in your jurisdiction insurance is a fringe benefit. You have no idea before you interview them what fringe benefits they will actually use. You are right that your situation won't be fixed by sharing the cost with the employees. It does change the numbers, but it doesn't solve the problem. The cost of fringe benefits is an important calculation when determining rates you will charge customers. Though you can look at your current mix of employees to get a average cost it can impact the actual financial performance of a project, contract, or team. If they are more expensive when compared to the average they will not generate the profits you expect. For a long term contract this can hurt the company if they drift from being inexpensive to being expensive over the life of the contact. Some companies do modify the pay and incentives based on the options chosen. I have known companies that awarded extra pay for not using the insurance because they received coverage from their spouse, or because they were retired military. I have also worked with companies that awarded extra vacation days for not needing insurance. There has also been a trend of not covering a spouse if the spouse also has a job. The idea is to let the other company cover their employee. Unfortunately for you a large difference between the most expensive package and the least expensive package makes it very hard to predict actual costs. The best you can do is pick a average cost based on your experience, and to refine those numbers as need. The larger the number of employes you have, the less likely that one new employee will render your estimates worthless. 

Keep in mind that if you owe taxes, and you can't pay them, then the IRS or the state taxing authority, could garnish your wages. That would be a big clue that there is an issue. If they would be concerned about non-payment: you are applying to be an accountant, then lying on the forms could get you fired. Note most government tax agencies look for missing years. It could be a matter of time before they ask about the missing forms. Edit: 

If they send you the offer, you must decide if their offer meets your needs. If it doesn't, you can either walk away, or make a counter offer -- Knowing that if you counter they can walk away and go with their next choice. What you are willing to compromise to depends on if you already have a job; if that job pays well enough; and if that job has a good work environment. There is no big secret to this negotiation. You have stated a minimally acceptable salary level. Now you are now waiting to see if they will meet it. That will determine if you want to counter, accept the offer, or walk away. If this job doesn't offer you the salary you want/need keep looking. In fact apply to other jobs today, and keep applying until the day you accept a job that meets your needs.
