Travel as you would normally. I.e, spend the money as if hypothetically you were not having your expenses covered. If you'd normally get a taxi, get a taxi. If you'd normally use public transport then you should use that. This is a good guideline for all expense claims. 

You can email the manager directly. You already have a professional relationship with the manager. It's appropriate to contact them personally. As you state in your question they've already invited you to do exactly that: 

There shouldn't really be any concept of "his code" at all. If you write code you should not become upset if someone improves it. At most, you could ask for a review as a courtesy or to ensure you are not introducing regressions. Given you have forked the code rather than modify it, such changes do not affect him at all. Perhaps you can work with him to merge back so everyone benefits (rather than maintaining both copies). 

I'm a student, currently in my penultimate year of school/first year of sixth form. Earlier this year, I did work experience at a small game developers in London consisting of around 10 employees. I learnt a lot while I was there, however, the commute itself ended up costing me around Â£40 for the whole week, which is a lot when you have no source of income. In summer, I am returning to the company to test some games for them, and anything else that I can do. The problem is, I'm going for around 4-5 weeks, and I'll struggle to cover the costs of travel each day. It's not a paid internship, so I'm working for free. How do I bring up the subject of some kind of travel allowance with them without coming across badly? I just don't know how to approach the matter in a professional manner. 

You might need the job, but I have a feeling you'll probably regret it. If you can hold on for a while longer, I am sure something more suitable will come up for you. 

No reputable or honest company should or would ever say that to a candidate. I also do not believe that they do not have the money to hire you as per the original promised amount. The first step of the hiring process besides who you want to hire is how much you can afford to pay them (employers always have a salary ceiling for a job role). If they're being honest, then it sounds like a poorly run company and one you probably shouldn't work for. There are numerous red flags in your question: 

This sounds completely normal to me. If you are a part of a smaller engineering team, your responsibilities are greater then that of a engineer in a team of hundreds or thousands. Every day I am switching between different languages myself, I improve and learn on my personal time and occasionally during down periods I am allowed to use work time to learn. My employer also offers each employee a personal development budget once a year (that is quite substantial). Although I am aware many don't have such a luxury where they work or even know of such programs. This is the norm I am afraid. It's sort of a misconception that there are developers out there only working with one language, especially if you work with the web. It's not uncommon for a modern day web developer to know all aspects of front-end, but also multiple back-end languages, databases and server administration. I would definitely bring this up in your next review and I encourage everyone else to do the same. Speak with your manager or boss about wanting to advance your skills in the form of extra study, new software or even just getting a couple of hours per week to experiment and learn something new. TL;DR This is very common. There aren't many places that just stick to the one language, the software/web landscape is constantly evolving and we're all expected to be good at many things instead of great at one or two things. At times it can suck, but the world keeps on advancing and we have to move fast to stay on top of it all. 

I am currently doing a short internship for a month at a games developers that may result in a part-time job at the end. I am generally a fast worker, and often complete tasks way before people expect me to. The main problem I have is that I feel as though I am pestering the employees when I am asking for stuff to do, because I'm there every half-hour to an hour. At one point they ran out of stuff for me to do until the manager got back to give me something to work on. Now I am finding it hard to go and ask for more work, because I feel anxious that I am annoying them, even though I know they appreciate having the stuff done. I've spent time on learning things I want to as well, but whenever I do I feel guilty that I'm not working hard because I'm reading up on coding etc. How do I better approach people asking for work to do without feeling as awkward and how do I make it so that they have an expectation for me to finish things quickly, and not constantly be surprised when I'm already finished? 

Asking for proof of current salary is poor form, in my opinion. Information on market rates and salaries is out there for companies to obtain and it is quite easy for a company to know if someone is bluffing. I have never been asked to provide proof of what I am earning, although I have never lied about that to an employer. There is never a reason for a company or individual to ask for proof, if they think the salary a candidate says they currently earn is inline with the market and/or what they're willing to pay, that should be the only deciding factor. If you're in X position currently and you say you're getting paid $120k when you are only being paid $100k, but the market says on average someone with your experience in your chosen field earns $130k, then that is pretty easy to work out. Lying about your current salary might be something many people here disagree with, but if you are currently being underpaid in comparison to what other people in your industry are, then I cannot see the harm personally. Especially knowing that companies can easily obtain information on market salaries for comparison. There are worse things you could lie about (such as your experience). I am not saying that lying is okay, but on the scale of dishonesty it is quite low. The bottom line is: if the company is willing to pay, what is the harm? 

The sixth form that I study at is joining (read being taken over by) a school's trust. They have decided to make the dress code significantly stricter. Currently, it is simply "business wear" but as of September they are making it more specific. In particular, they are requiring girls to wear blouses/shirts. This would be fine, except that any and all shirts I wear gape open along the line of buttons due to the lack of affordable shirts that suit my body shape. As a result, I would be extremely uncomfortable wearing a shirt, but I don't know how to bring this up with the new headteacher for next year, since she is generally unmoving on issues of dress code. Furthermore, she's not really the one in power, the school trust is, and I have no way to communicate with them that the dress code is unreasonable. I havent worn shirts for the past two years I've been at the school, and I've been complimented on how smart I look, so it's not an issue of me not meeting the original dress code either. Finally, this issue only affects me as the other two girls in the sixth form are leaving at the end of this academic year. How do I get my voice heard on the subject by somebody with the power to actually change the dress code? 

Very normal. Management want to extol your virtues and demonstrate how the internship program adds value to the company. Don't be afraid of clearly stating benefits you have brought to the company; this will not come across as arrogant. 

Isn't that sufficient motivation? Don't they want their grade? Take initiative to track who is participating. Invite everyone to a meeting to establish leadership (you?) then afterwards send minutes saying what criteria you you will be using to judge participation, then start the work of breaking the requirement down into tasks. If they don't work, they don't get their grade. If your team wants to do well in the competition they'll have to pick up the slack from others. 

I would not interpret the above as "apply online" / "email HR", although you can and probably should do that in addition. Yes, you should also attach your CV. 

No. You should not be expected to memorise APIs. As long as you can demonstrate use of common/basic functionality you should pass the interview. If during the whiteboard session you feel you need to look something up simply tell the interviewer; if they chastise you for not knowing the API by heart you should point out that this is exactly what programmers use Google for all the time, and your memory is better spent on something useful. 

Never speak of a current or former employer in a negative way. Even if the negativity is warranted, it never translates that well across the table to your new employer (even if it's the truth). As always, when you leave a company that has negatives it is all about how you frame it. It is worth pointing out that disclosing a company you work for is not doing well financially or X other reason might be considered private information which could be used by a competitor against the company. In that kind of situation, it is best to give a generic reason or say nothing at all to protect yourself. Some generic reasons for leaving are; 

Always get things in writing and signed off for piece of mind. However, if the communication was done via email and you have emails that that show them agreeing to pay you $20 per hour, for 40 hours per month then that in itself is a contract. It might not be an iron-clad contract with clauses and protections, but you have an agreement nonetheless. If you both agreed to a specific price and you can show that the employer agreed with this, that shows intent and agreement. While emails can definitely be faked, if you use an email provided from a company such as Google the emails can be checked for authenticity (in the case of Google it is DKIM + SPF). As always, if you're in a different country to the employer (or even the same country), the cost for challenging this in a court would be very expensive and sadly most people who mess remote employees around like this know that is the case. 

You leaving is in fact one of the reasons the presentation has value. By showing what you've done it invites other team members to ask follow-up questions and capture any knowledge-transfer that may have been missed. 

If the culture is a bad fit it would be better for both you and the company if you declined the job offer rather than quit after a short time. By that logic it seems reasonable to talk to developers via LinkedIn. 

Be open about your situation to your new company. State your intention is to leave to the new company but you are happy to stay if they match the offer. Be prepared to leave (or be replaced) if they do not. This is entirely reasonable, and although it's an uncomfortable for your current company it just illustrates that they are paying below market rates. If you chose to stay without saying anything you will likely become discontent very quickly, as you know you are being underpaid.
