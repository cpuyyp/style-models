First, we should ask what purpose MSC type codes serve. After all modern papers can be indexed in full text and, even if paywalls make full text search impractical one can do a full text search on abstracts at mathscinet. It seems to me they offer two important features. 

Are there r.e. sets $B >_T 0$ and $C >_T 0$, $C \not\geq_T B$ such that for all r.e. $W \leq_T B$ either $W \leq_T 0$ or $C \oplus W \geq_T B$. The explanation for the title is because one can think of this as saying that there is a gap between $0$ and $B$ in the r.e. degrees join $C$. I've been hitting my head against this problem for awhile. Originally I thought I had a construction of r.e. degrees with the following property but now I think it's impossible and worry I'm missing something dumb so before I waste more time trying to decide the question one way or another I figured I should find out if I'm missing anything dumb. Note that it's easy to see that if $B,C$ satisfy then $B$ and $C$ are a minimal pair. Now the initial temptation is to try and use a proof something along the lines of Sack's density theorem for r.e. degrees but one quickly runs into problems since trying to restrain $W$ to ensure $\phi_i(C \oplus W) \neq B$ might impose unbounded restraint (though with finite lim inf) but since $B$ can't compute the stages at which elements enter $C$ to disrupt $\phi_i(C \oplus W)$ one quickly runs into a conflict between the requirement that $W \leq_T B$ and the attempt to ensure $C \oplus W \not\geq_T B$. Indeed, I can show there is no uniform solution in the following sense. Given a finite lits $i_0\ldots i_n$ of indexes I can uniformly build $C, B$ such that if $W = \phi_{i_j}(B)$ then $W \leq_T 0$ or $C \oplus W \geq_T B$. Anyway, before I waste any more time trying to decide this question I want to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious. 

I know this isn't an answer but you said you were looking for any thoughts. It might be bonkers because it's been awhile since my Galois theory but based on my fuzzy memory and wikipedia any number field is characterized by a degree $n$ and $q_0...q_{n-1}$ such that some primitive element $x$ satisfies $x^n = q_0 + q_1 x + q_2 x^2 + \ldots + q_{n-1} x^{n-1}$. Given this you might want to try and prove (say by induction on the terms in some nice form in $\phi$) that it's uniformly computable whether or not there is a counterexample to a given $\Sigma_2$ statement in an algebraic number field of degree $n$ and then try and bound the minimum degree that the a counterexample must appear by if it exists. Hmm, but this would establish the much stronger result that the $\Sigma_2$ theory was decidable if all those parts are true so there is probably something wrong about it. But I found it interesting enough that I'm hoping someone can tell me why this can't be right. 

The first usage calls for a basic hierarchical description of major areas of mathematical research. Each area should be well populated and each paper should fall into only one or at most a handful of areas. These areas should be developed enough that they won't disappear with changes in research focus. The second usage calls for a plentiful list of canonical tags for particular objects, approaches or questions. Each paper might fall under arbitrarily many such tags, the more the better. As far as this use is concerned there is no real harm if research directions change and papers falling under some tag stop being published. Codes should be generously added for every conceivable object/approach/question constrained only by the requirement that every such concept have a canonical code (no codes that are synonyms). Search engines could then maintain a list of terms associated with each such code so one could do a search in computability theory for papers that mention both "model" (in the model theory sense) and admissible ordinal. I submit that this naturally suggests two systems of codes. One hierarchical that roughly corresponds to the first two digits + letter, e.g., 03A, of MSC2010 and the other a much more numerous database of tags and their synonyms. 

In the following situation $\mathbf{d_0}$ and $\mathbf{d_1}$ are not independent: $$(\exists \mathbf{r}, \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b})(\mathbf{r} \in \mathbf{d_0} \land_T \mathbf{d_1} \;\&\; \mathbf{r} \oplus \mathbf{a} \equiv_{T} \mathbf{d_0} \;\&\; \mathbf{a} \oplus \mathbf{d_1} \ngeq_{T} \mathbf{d_0}$$ Proof: Consider $D_0=R\oplus A$ and $D_1=R \oplus D_1$. $D_0\Delta D_1 = A \oplus D_1 \ngeq_T D_0 \leq_T D_0 \oplus D_1$ If $(\exists \mathbf{r})(\mathbf{r} \in \mathbf{d_0} \land_T \mathbf{d_1})$ with $\mathbf{r}$ of hyperimmune degree then $\mathbf{d_0}$ and $\mathbf{d_1}$ are not independent. If $\mathbf{r}$ is of hyperimmune degree then it computes a weakly 1-generic. Divide this weakly 1-generic into 5 mutually weakly 1-generic components and call this set $G=g_0\oplus g_1 \oplus g_2 \oplus g_3 \oplus g_4$. Now we build $D'_0$ as follows. If $g_1(n)=1$ then set $D'_0(n)=g_0(n)$. If $g_1(n)=0$ and this is the $k$-th $0$ encountered let $D'_0(n)=D_0(n)$. Define $D'_1$ similarly with $g_3,g_4$. Now we claim that $D'_0, g_2,D'_1$ are mutually weakly generic. To see this observe that if it is possible to extend an initial segment of length $l$ of these reals to meet a $\Sigma^0_1$ dense set then it is possible to extend a length $l$ segment of the reals $g_0\oplus g_1 \oplus g_2 \oplus g_3 \oplus g_4$ so that $g_0,g_2,g_4$ are extended by whatever sequence would extend $D'_0, g_2,D'_1$ to meet the dense set and $g_1,g_3$ are extended by all 1's so that $D'_0, D'_1$ copies these extensions. But now consider the sets $D'_0 \oplus \emptyset \oplus G$ and $\emptyset \oplus D'_1 \oplus G$. These sets below to $\mathbf{d_0}$ and $\mathbf{d_1}$ but have symetric difference equivalent to $D'_0 \oplus D'_1$. If this could compute $D_0 \oplus D_1$ then $D'_0 \oplus D'_1$ would be able to compute $g_2$. Yet, densely often $g_2$ has the chance to disagree with such a computation so by mutual weak 1-genericity this is a contradiction. 

In my opinion one of the best examples of a physical statement depending on a mathematically independent statement is provided by Malament-Hogarth machines (You can find a bunch of other links just by doing a google scholar search). These are machines which it is argued (though others argue they are impossible) are allowed by general relativity and allow the operator to determine the answer to any $\Pi^0_1$ claim in finite time. As, by Godel's theorem, given any computably axiomitizeable theory $T$ the $\Pi^0_1$ statement $Con(T)$ is independent from $T$. So whatever theory one chooses to work in this lets you produce a physical statement (the machine with such and such construction ... will give answer blah) that depends on the truth of an independent question. Note that this doesn't specifically involve large cardinal assumptions themselves but it does give you a physical system whose outcome depends on the consistency of large cardinal statements (e.g. $Con(ZFC+exists measurable)$) However, one should not assume that how these physical systems turn out tells us what is mathematically true. We develop physical theories by accepting those hypothesises that seem to be good descriptions of reality and it is usually convenient to write those theories in terms of the most natural mathematical structures like the natural numbers or the reals. However, it is equally true that the theory which says experiments turn out the way General Relativity formulated in this non-standard model of the reals/integers predicts (almost certainly it can be formalized in the two-sorted first-order theory of second order arithmetic but if not use a non-standard model of ZFC instead) is as compatible with all our evidence as the theory which applies General Relativity formulated in the standard model. Ohh to put it more simply if your Malament-Hogarth machine tells you that a particular computation converges in finite time you can't really be sure that the computation really converges in finite time or if the temporal structure of the universe is non-standard and the computation only converges at some non-standard time. Thought for a perspective which argues that we could use the results of these MH machines to determine mathematical truth see Sharon Berry's Malamentâ€“Hogarth Machines and Tait's Axiomatic Conception of Mathematics with preprint here. (Conflict of interest warning: I'm married to Sharon though I disagree with her conclusions). 

I find I frequently have to refer to the set of ordinal notations below some given notation. For instance given a notation $\alpha$ I often need to refer to the set $\lbrace \beta \mid \beta <^{\mathcal{O}}_s \alpha\rbrace$. Higher Recursion Theory simply writes such sets as $W_{g(\alpha), s}$ (where $g$ is the appropriate computable function) but this isn't very helpful when writing a paper. I find that when one is working with constructions occurring at infinite ordinal levels (say in $\alpha$-REA sets) these sets pop up everywhere and without a specific notation for them it is unwieldy to refer to them or specify properties of the enumeration. Is there a standard notation for what I'm looking for? If not any suggestions? How about $\mathcal{O}_{< \alpha, s}$, i.e., the part of Kleene's O below $\alpha$? Writing out $\mathcal{O}\restriction_{< \alpha, s}$, while correct, seems confusing as it's not obvious what set the stage subscript refers to. I want to settle on something so I can put it in the next version of my recursion theory latex package. 

Let $A, B, C..X, Y$ range over potentially proper classes in NBG set theory (or adding class quantification to ZFC in obvious way) and $x,y,z$ range over sets. Since I don't know the proper symbols for formula classes that have $n$ proper class quantifiers I'll just continue the convention of add 1 to the upper subscript ($\Sigma^0_n/\Sigma^1_n$) as we move to quantifying over a higher type of object. 

I know this is kind of a trivial answer but I think it's relevant if I understood you. Ultimately (understanding computability as a property of sets of integers), whether or not a set of rationals is computable depends on how I choose to code them. For instance if I decide to code n/m by the pair (f(n), f(m)) rather than (n,m) where $f(2n)$ is the $n$-th element in $0'$ and $f(2n+1)$ is the $n$-th element not in $0'$ then all the sudden the set of rationals of the form $\frac{1}{o}$ with $o$ odd becomes non-computable. Now this is a silly example because there is no good reason to use this coding. However, there are examples (representations of measures comes to mind but I'm sure there are better ones) where there are different codings we want to use for different purposes. So there just isn't a fact of the matter as to whether the set of rationals I gave above is computable...it is on one coding and not on another. So I don't see how what you are asking for could possibly work. It's just that we usually gloss over the fact that the choice of coding also matter because the Church-Turing thesis tells us that in normal circumstances any way we might be inclined to regard as an algorithmic manipulation will correspond to a computable operation if we choose a coding that we also regard as algorithmic (i.e. something humans can do with pen and paper). But that's a contingent philosophical thesis not a mathematically formalizeable claim. But I worry I'm misunderstanding you and didn't give a good response. EDIT: I was misunderstanding the question...see the comments below. 

I bet this generalizes out to showing that if the degrees are incomparable and both compute some non-computable set they turn out not to be independent on this notion. However, this might be totally wrong. 

MSC codes let one track all papers in a given are even when no particular search terms would be sufficiently specific without leaving anything out. This allows paper archives to present their contents in a hierarchical manner or searches to be restricted to a particular subject. MSC codes (at least in theory, I've never used them for this purpose) distinguish papers working with particular mathematical objects/approaches that can't easily be identified using keyword searches. For instance even if I restrict my attention to papers in computability a search for "admissible set" is likely to turn up to much (admissible, like good, is overused) and miss some instances that use other terminology. 

I think we can work out the basic properties of this notion right here. Let $\mathbf{d_0}$ and $\mathbf{d_1}$ be our degrees. 

Suppose $P(C)$ is a non-empty $\Sigma^2_0$ class predicate, i.e., $P(C)$ is equivalent to a formula quantifying only over sets. Must there be a definable class $B$ satisfying $P(B)$ (where definable means definable via quantification over sets no proper classes...so same thing as in ZFC)? What if $P(C)$ is instead $\Sigma^2_n/\Pi^2_n$? I'm tempted to think the answer is yes (at least for $\Sigma^2_0$). However, it seems to me that you can think of this as asking whether there is a (full height of $V$) path through a certain tree of classes and what is going on seems very similar to the question of whether every nonempty arithmetic tree has a $\Delta^1_1$ path where the answer is no. Indeed there is a $\Pi^0_2$ class with no $\Delta^1_1$ path and as that is exactly where things started to fail for me with the class question it seems the evidence says no even in that case. Also I'm probably just failing to think of something simple since my set theory is rusty. Remark on Intended Question Turns out the question I was interested in was for MK set theory not NBG (so one can comprehend with formulas involving class quantifiers) but I'd forgotten they were different. Luckily the answer below answered that as well.
