It's a common criticism of Spencer's social Darwinism that it misunderstands the entire theory of evolution and the meaning of "fitness" such that it is commonly exploited to fulfill specific hateful political agendas. However, what exactly is wrong with the notion that the most competent individuals in society thrive? Consider an academic setting with a particularly rigorous professor running a particularly rigorous course. Obviously, only the most studious and tenacious students will be able to pass while the lazier ones will either fail or drop the class, and rightly so; only those who earn their keep should be rewarded. How is this idea immoral? Perhaps I am misunderstanding social Darwinism. 

I am aware that Kant addressed Hume's skepticism on causality, but I don't see anything in his CPR that solves the problems of induction and uniformity of nature in other contexts like everyday life, where Hume's question, "will the sun rise tomorrow?" seems to persist. Exactly how does/would Kant solve the problems of induction (particularly uniformity of nature) in non-causal contexts, if he did at all? I am aware that there has already been a question like this, but I thought the answer to it only addressed induction in the context of causal formulations about the world; in this respect, I think Kant only dodged the problem of induction in causal formulations by solidifying causality as an intuition. Rationalizing your belief that the sun will rise tomorrow and rationalizing your belief that C-fiber firing causes pain seem to be two different things. 

I'm currently writing a paper for a class that's supposed to "weave" together the philosophical system presented in Plato's Allegory and dialogues. When I spoke with my professor on the assignment, he said that Plato's own philosophical opinions were unwritten and cannot necessarily be gleaned from his own writings, and thus I ought not to refer to the system found in Plato's texts as "Plato's philosophy." Is this true? Are we wrong to attribute things like the Theory of Forms and the proto-social contract theory as described in Meno to Plato? 

After reading Kant's Idea For a Universal History, I've become intrigued by Kant's notion of Nature guiding the dealings of men towards a "perfectly rightful civil constitution." Although the relationship between man and Nature remains clear, what would Kant say is the meaning for any human existence independent of Nature? Perhaps there is some overlap between the meaning of human life simpliciter and the meaning of human life in relation with Nature? 

It seems to me that the rejection of the validity of induction would cause a deep skepticism in pretty much everything but most prominently in perception. If we can never assume uniformity of nature, then every inference about the future and the future based on the past is invalid. Thus wouldn't the rejection of induction restrict us to only be able to talk validly about our present phenomenal experiences or whatever is directly present in the mind? What are the practical ramifications of rejecting induction? It seems that it would throw us all into intense skepticism. 

I think a possible solution might not lie in the truth or our knowledge of the truth of theory-laden theories or hypotheses as much as in their usefulness. Even if everything might be theory-laden, we still get magnificent results from the application of science. Although we can't claim with certainty to have knowledge or knowledge of the truth of phenomena, we can still make predictions and inventions for the sake of their products. In this light, then, we might be able to refute the anti-vaxxer or climate change denier by comparing his predictions and according results with a credible scientist's predictions and according results; the conceptual scheme that made more accurate predictions than the other would then qualify as "better" (albeit not "true"). Then, depending on how inaccurate the results turned out, we should reject the science-denier's theory/hypotheses on the grounds that it would simply be not worth our time. Alternatively, if the anti-science advocate's policies were enacted and harm arose from it, e.g. more and more children would begin to die of polio, then we could use these adverse effects as justification to reject their theory. To put it more simply, we should only accept the scientific community's conclusions on climate change or vaccines if they are more useful to believe. I'm more confident with this solution in the context of the natural sciences, but I would think it would still be applicable in social and political issues as well. Intuitively, I would respond that the relativism of social and political issues could be avoided if we only accepted falsifiable hypotheses, but that solution is obviously off the table. I'm no scholar, and I'm not sure if Quine or Kuhn or any of those you mentioned would even espouse this view, but I still think it is relevant and doesn't clash with theory-laddenness assumptions. 

For me the question has brought out the different senses of left and right, which may or may not be interrelated. The distinction is between a question like: 

Suppose we accept that there would be no fact of the matter about left and right in such a universe. This alone would, however, not make the traveler’s insistence nonsensical. To him, his right hand remains the right one in spite of any orientation swapping. (Of course we don’t have to call it the ‘right’ hand.) I believe the question of how a human subject knows the right hand from the left is assimilable to how he knows the right hand from the right foot, or the nose. Again, we can strip the questions of ‘right’ and ‘left’ and also of ‘hand’ and ‘foot.’ We can also strip them of epistemology by asking what it is for a sensation in the right hand to be in the right hand. Or if we are allowed the terminology ‘tactile location’ we are asking what individuates tactile locations. We may ask the same question of ‘visual location.’ When I open my eye I am confronted with what looks like a surface. I can divide it into left, center and right regions, or upper, center and lower ones. I believe I could do this even if I were floating in space without any gravitational pull and didn’t have the benefit of my right hand often appearing in the right region or my hair often falling in from the upper. Of course I may not have the ‘right and left’ and ‘upper and lower’ vocabulary. Again we are speaking of individuation of visual locations. I don’t think there is any necessity about the correlation between visual and tactile locations. In each of these, I think something fundamental is going on. That is to say, I don’t think one ‘learns’ that a pain is in one’s right foot and not elsewhere. ‘At first I only knew there was some pain, but didn’t know where. But by and by, I came to learn to locate them. I had to hire a teacher and practice it on my free time.’ This is not our experience; I don’t even know it makes sense to speak of ‘knowing’ or ‘not knowing’ there. In the same way, I don’t think we ‘learn’ that a thing is in the center of our visual field, or to the left, or to the right. Of course, our visual and tactile locations happen to correlate. My right hand often appears to the right of my visual field. Or the sight of a dog biting the hand ‘over here’ in my visual field often (all right, always) correlates to my having pain ‘over here’ in my tactile field. Suppose then I hold an apple in my left hand and see it in the corner of my left eye. The apple is ‘to my left in space’ as it were. This location in space would bear a certain relation to the ‘left’ region in my visual field as well as the ‘left’ region of my tactile field. We may say any number of things about this relation (not all of them right). E.g. the left region in space, existing independently, is sensed, tracked etc. by sensory events in me; is a ‘construct’ of my sensory locations; is mere shorthand for saying what happened in my sensory fields; etc. According to this view, the concept of spatial left and right to a human subject would in some way or other derive from the locations in his sensory fields. The individuation of locations in a particular sensory field would be fundamental, meaning not the sort of thing one learns. I believe that the visual experience may lead the way (as it were) in the assignment of location. That is to say, while my nose, neck, left and right arms and hands, the groins, the two legs and feet, the twenty digits, while all these are distinct without my having to learn the distinction, I don’t know that they stack neatly one way or other. For example, could I have known that my thumb is farthest away from the pinky without seeing the five fingers? I don’t intend to tell a physiological or developmental story. I believe there would be a way to strip the thing above of all that stuff so that we are left with a thin analytical statement about the reducibility of spatial location to individuation of location in sensory fields, which is not a thing to be learned. Such location would survive any orientation swapping as is imagined in the other answer because we are talking about two different things. I want to add that I am not sure about this, but only propose it as a possibility. I certainly have not argued for it. Thanks.
