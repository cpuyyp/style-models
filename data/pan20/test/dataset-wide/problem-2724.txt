For Middle Way Buddhism no aspect of the chair would fundamentally exists. There would be no such thing as 'fundamental existence'. What is fundamental would transcend the existence/non-existence distinction. If this were not so then existence would be inexplicable without the use of an infinity of turtles. The trick would be not to reify objects. Here's Colin McGinn wresting with the problem as a teenager. It has no solution in Western thought. “…[P]icture me sitting on a bench staring at a British mailbox on a blustery spring day in Blackpool. I had just been reading about the questions of substance and qualities, and was suitably transfixed. Is an object the sum of its qualities or does it have an existence that is some way goes beyond its qualities? The mailbox had a variety of qualities - it was red, cylindrical, metal, etc. - but it seemed to be more than just the collection of these; it was a thing, a “substance,” that had these qualities. But what was this substance that had those qualities? Did it lie behind them in some way, supporting them like the foundation of a house? If so, what was this underlying thing like - what qualities did it have? If it had some qualities, wouldn’t there be the same problem again, since it would also have to be distinct from these qualities? But if it had no qualities, what kind of thing could it be? How could these be something that had no qualities? So maybe we should say that there is nothing more to a mailbox than the qualities it manifests. And yet how can an object be just a set of abstract qualities? Isn’t it more solid and concrete than that? … I had a vague mental image of a grey amorphous something that constituted the underlying mailbox, to which its various manifest qualities mysteriously were attached… Yet as soon as I replaced this fuzzy image with the qualities by themselves, trying to think of the mailbox as just a “bundle of qualities,” the object itself seemed to disappear.” Colin McGinn The Making of a Philosopher 

I feel that the discussion is stuck in the wrong set of terms and concepts, and I know of no religion or philosophy that meets the OP's specification. Rebirth of some kind is almost always asserted by religion since without it an evolutionary view of consciousness becomes impossible as does any sensible system of ethics. The subtler idea is of an ocean of consciousness from which individual 'alters' arise like waves, not separate but identifiable as a disturbance. Thus our consciousness would arise from the ocean and when it falls back it carries with it impressions or tendencies, and these will lead to a further incarnation of consciousness since it has yet to be fully purified of ego-desires and so forth. This is the merry-go-round that Buddhists, Taoists, Sufis, Theosophists, Advaitans and their like are trying to get off for the sake of union with 'God' or 'nirvana' and eternal peace. The common 'Christian' idea that our final reward will be to be resurrected in our human bodies is a non-starter. It is not taught by Jesus and it is not a goal pursued by any seeker with ambition. A body is a limit and not compatible with true freedom and immortality. Even if we were resurrected in this way we would still not have achieved our potential. As for the numbers game, this is irrelevant once we think of consciousness as unified. For the mystic consciousness is All and it is ONE. It would be only our conceptual delusions that lead us to think otherwise. I suggest leaving modern Christianity aside and having a look at the classical form of it, and also checking out 'rebirth' in Buddhism. You'll have objections but they probably won't be the same ones. It may also be worth reading Schrodinger's argument against the multiplicity of souls, an idea he rejects outright in favour of the Upanishadic view of consciousness, rebirth and God. This would the view taken by the Perennial philosophy in general and it is not easy to find telling objections to it. Indeed, it has proved impossible to date. It is worth saying that even quite skilled Buddhists struggle with the details of rebirth. Also it can be noted that while Buddhist doctrine can be justified and proved in logic for the most part, the doctrine of karma and rebirth is, as far as I can tell, a 'lemma' in the sense that while it is logically coherent and consistent with the rest of the doctrine it cannot actually be proved in logic. That is, the ontology, epistemology and cosmology can be justified by metaphysical analysis, but not karma and rebirth. They would follow naturally but we are not forced to endorse them. All in all it's a very difficult topic and only accessible to a serious student of comparative religion or hands-on yoga practice. 

You say... "It is scientifically, philosophically and psychologically impossible to prove or disprove the existence of God, as many posts have said. Why not move on and eliminate the possibility of going to hell?" This is a very bold statement and not correct. Some proofs of the non-existence of God are famous and effective. Examples would be Nagarjuna's 'Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way' and (less-formally) Bradley's 'Appearance and Reality'. The whole of existence is reduced by their arguments, including that of God. This is not quite atheism, or this interpretation is not forced on us, but it is a denial of any God we might imagine. In his comment above Conifold notes crucially that by some definitions of existence God does not exist but is believed to be real even so. This would be the God endorsed by Keith Ward in his 'God: A Guide for the Perplexed' and is the 'classical' Christian view of God. To exist is to 'stand-out' but what would God stand-out from? In metaphysics it is possible to prove the non-fundamental nature of existence and thus of everything that exists. I think maybe you underestimate the power of logic and analysis. You may also need to decouple Hell and God. Many atheists believe in Hell (or hell-realms) and many theists do not. In the end your view is guesswork. You may find it comforting or useful but your reasoning does not get as far as settling the question of God's existence but rather just gives up on it. If you have in mind the most common forms of folk-theism then your argument may have some value but as soon as we move on to a sophisticated concept of God it misses the mark. ' 

Dennett says in "The Intentional Stance" that: "first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose." but can we treat an object as an agent with purpose if it doesn't have the autonomy that I described above? 

I would completely endorse the first two possibilities you list, the third partly, and the fourth not at all. Western academic philosophy is a hopeless mess and as you suggest the consequences for society are catastrophic. The rise of philosophobia (Dawkins, Tyson et al) is a clear sign that this form of philosophy is dead on its feet. The problem is simple, It is that stereotypically Western philosophers take no notice of their own results. They discover that all positive metaphysical positions are absurd and thus that all questions about the world as a whole are undecidable but do not discard them. The result is stagnation and endless unnecessary footnotes to Plato. But things seem to be changing. Now that departments are closing and jobs are being lost there is a real incentive to do philosophy better and make some progress. Then maybe the profession might choose to catch up with the Perennial philosophy rather than devoting another twenty centuries to trying to prove it false. 

This is a very tricky issue. As you say, the words are often used sloppily or in differing ways. You're right to say that all objective facts are subjective, and one strategy to allow for this is to use the word 'inter-subjective'. People sometimes use 'objective fact' to mean a fact that is inter-subjective, verified by a shared subjective experience. It is hard to see how an observation can be an objective fact. A complication is that a major school of thought denies the reality of the distinction between the objective and the subjective. Schopenhauer for instance, speaks of his 'better consciousness', a level of awareness for which the subject/object dichotomy evaporates to be seen as a perceptual error. This is the common experience of those who meditate. I feel that you're right and that the issues are muddled in much of philosophy. It's not that any one philosopher is muddled, but that the words are used in varying ways and with varying degrees of care. 

It may be that the guru convinced his followers that this action would help them to attain to the Godhead, immortality and pure awareness. It would be the same argument as the Biblical 'If the eye offendeth, pluck it out'. No brainwashing would be required since it is quite an easy argument to make (assuming that castration reduces sexual desire and not just the birthrate), and quite easy to see some sense in it. He wouldn't convince me since this drastic action seems like cheating to me. It is not an overcoming of desire but an admission of failure. But I can see how it might come about. Anybody who succumbs to brainwashing is not a truth-seeker, but we all have a tendency to fall-in with people who display great certainty and confidence. To know what lies behind all this we'd have to know a lot about the situation so I don't think we can simply dismiss it as the brain-washing of a lot of people with low self-esteem. After all, the whole point of an authentic gurus' teaching might be said to be the fostering of low self-esteem (and high Self-esteem). It all depends on the guru. Some are utter frauds and we have to be able to discriminate. It takes time to learn how to do this and meanwhile many of us are suckered in by absurd practices and doctrines. I once met someone who has two PhDs, one in physics, who spent thirty years following a fraud, even wrote a good book about it. It means nothing. There are always frauds about. 

In my view the comparison is difficult because there is so much bad science and bad religion, and what people are comparing is often just this. If we see religion as method and practice then as a means of discovering truth it is scientific. It relies on experiment and experience, not faith and conjecture. If we see science as being able to decide metaphysical question then it is scientism and might as well be a faith-based religion. So a rational person would study both until they have sorted the wheat from the chaff and by then the distinction between them will be merely one of research focus and domains of knowledge. Those who would draw a clear line between science and religion are usually seeing the more naive aspects of both, as maybe represented by Dawkins and Tyson on one side and the average Church of England parish priest or American mid-Western Christian on the other. A rational person would want to delve deeper into the two areas of knowledge than this. 

These words are often used very loosely in philosophy and cause much trouble. The reason is the common idea that ''truth' is the same as 'belief' where the belief is 'justified'. But a justified belief is a tentative belief and not a known truth, and if a truth is not known then we cannot call it a truth. Descartes saw this problem and chose his axiom accordingly. A proper answer would be quite long and technical, but for now I'd just keep it simple. A belief is what we believe. A belief may be justified or unjustified depending on the strength of the evidence for it. If the evidence is strong then it may be considered a justified belief but cannot be considered a truth. A truth is something we know to be true such that we require no further evidence or justification and could not be wrong. Much trouble comes from equating justified belief with truth, as in the phrase 'justified true belief'. I would ban this phrase from philosophical discourse as an unhelpful muddle of words, but regrettably I'm not in charge. . 

This is a source of fantastic frustration for me. Some modern Stoics are materialists, yet materialism is a point-blank rejection of the Unity of the Universe, which is a central plank of Stoic doctrine. Modern Stoicism seems to be fad for anti-religious folk who nevertheless want some meaning in their life. It makes no sense whatsoever in the hands of 'Stoics' like Massimo Pigliucci and becomes a muddle of poor thinking. Not at all what its founders intended. The doctrine is being betrayed by people who don't understand it but want to bend it to their purpose. To understand it I would suggest studying Buddhist ethics and ontology and then comparing it to that of Stoicism. It can be seen that the latter is just a less well-explained and less well-informed version of the former. Both declare the Unity of the Universe, and both declare, 'only those who know they are not free know they are free'. This can hardly be a coincidence and it shows that Stoicism was well thought-out by its founders. I have great sympathy for Stoics trying to make sense of the bowdlerised modern form often promoted. It's a lost cause. It does not make sense. 

If we regard Christianity as unique among other unique religions then it will appear to be incomprehensible, arbitrary, idiosyncratic and probably implausible. If we buy into those teachings of the Church that make it idiosyncratic then it will be so. By adopting this perspective Feynman is led to voice the criticisms you make, viz. the play is too small for the stage. A naive view of religion leads to easy objections. But if we interpret Christianity as merely another version of the 'True Religion' underneath all the ecclesiastical clutter then these criticism evaporate. Nobody could call this Christianity too small for the stage unless, like Feynman, they simply do not know it. The difficulty of answering the question is caused by the various forms of Christianity. Your criticism are unanswerable for some forms of it but are toothless for other forms. If we take,say, the book 'A Course in Miracles' or the 'Mystical Theology' of the pseudo-Dionysius then these criticisms are easy to answer, but I have a feeling you're speaking of what we are taught in school about our religion and in this case I'd say the criticisms stand. The issue is much wider than ethics. The entire metaphysical scheme of Christianity is undermined by your criticisms, and also the entire plausibility of religion. It would take us off-topic to delve into this, but if you start making objections to the 'commonplace' Christianity of the masses then it's like shooting fish in a barrel. This should make us wonder whether this is actually a sensible interpretation of the teachings. It is not forced on us, but to get past it would require that we adopt a more esoteric and gnostic interpretation, an interpretation the Church as an institution considers heretical. So, the answer to the question will depend on our interpretation of the teachings. We can choose one which makes them absurd or one that makes them sensible. The idea that it is limited in time and space only arises if we forget that by a common view Christianity teaches that time and space are reducible and metaphysically-speaking illusory. The idea of 'size' and 'extension' would be a mistake when viewed as fundamental features of Reality - as is the most widespread view in religion. 

Popper doesn't argue that we should believe something is true simply because it hasn't been falsified. He argues that we cannot assume it is false unless it has been, and that if it cannot be falsified in principle then it is not a scientific idea. A difficulty that arises is that a proposition about the world that is true will not be falsifiable. So as we move into philosophy Poppers thoughts have to modified somewhat, and it seems likely this may also the case for certain propositions in physics. He is not arguing from ignorance but, rather, arguing that decisions should not be taken on the basis of it. Innocent until proven guilty is the idea.
