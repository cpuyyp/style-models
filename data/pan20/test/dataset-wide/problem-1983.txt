Yes, some headhunters simply hunt for jobs and candidates and hope to get a fee from the company when you're hired. And yes, there is a significant drawback to you by allowing one of them to present you to the company. I've seen how this works on the company side. You post a job notice, and you get some resumes from individual candidates and some from headhunters. The ones from the headhunters you have to pay a fee to hire, so they get put in a separate pile that only gets looked at if you're desparate. That often doesn't happen. It depends on the job market for that specific skill at that time. This is why many job descriptions will have a line at the bottom that says "principals only". Principal means the candidate himself, not a third party like a headhunter. There is a exception to this, which is when a company hires or contracts with a recruiter to fill a specific job. In that case, the recuiter gets the fee regardless of who they hire and how the company hears about them. Those recruiters are more like outsourced HR, and you can deal with them the same way. They have no reason to obscure the identity of the company to you, or obscure your identity to the company. When I get a call from a recruiter, I always ask what their relationship with the company is. I usually tell the first kind I'm not interested in having them represent me. About the only time the first kind makes any sense is when you are actively looking, and you've already done your homework and compiled a list of open jobs that seem to be a fit. If a third party finds something you wouldn't otherwise know about, then you have nothing to lose. However, that is very rare. Usually the call will be about a job you are already aware of. Tell them that, and they'll go away quickly since they know they won't make any commission off of placing you there. There is no harm telling them your requirements and desires for a job in case they find one you don't, but don't hold your breath. 

There is really nothing you can do while the computers are doing something that takes a while? I don't believe that. If you regularly have this down time, then arrange other tasks to take advantage of it. For example, don't check your emails first thing in the morning in such a way that it displaces other work. Get the computers cranking, then check email while you're waiting. Even if you have no other immediate job tasks to perform, there is surely always something more to learn. There must be a manual to read about this new software you're not really up to speed on, new product announcements to look over for relevancy, forums for IT people to check out and maybe pick up a few pointers from you never thought of before, or even just cleaning up your desk. There is always something better to do than just sitting there. 

This is definitely something you should bring up if they don't. You said this is a software development position, so I'm assuming most of your job can be done any time, as long as it gets done. Insisting on a rigid schedule for such a job is silly and not in the company's interest, but there are a few dinosaurs still out there. It is reasonable to expect you to be there during some limited "core" hours for necessary interactions with others, but that should be only around half the work day, if that. These details are usually mentioned in the interview. If they say they want you there from 9:00-18:00 with a break from 10:00-10:15, lunch from 12:00-12:30, and another break from 14:30-14:45, just tell them that's not how you work, but of course you will be present doing enough hours in the middle of the day to overlap with co-workers you need to interact with. If they insist, then this job is not for you. Most likely they won't insist. If this is not brought up, then make sure you bring it up. This is not a discussion you want to have the first day on the job, or after you've quit from the previous job. I recently interviewed for a job where I was told the company schedule was 9 hours starting at 8:00 on Mon-Thu and 4 hours starting at 8:00 on Fri. I said something like "That won't work for me", of course explaining that I'll put in the time and be available during some core hours. This is a engineering job where I do have to interact with production, other engineers, and management, but nothing that needs to be done at fixed times. I got hired, and was again told the schedule. I again told them that I won't be doing that, and even flat out told them I thought that even just asking was unreasonable. I've settled into a schedule where I am there from 6:30-14:30 without taking any breaks Mon-Fri. Now a few months later they've had a chance to see that I put in the time and get things done, and nobody has complained or even mentioned the schedule. I also realized that several other people have their own schedule too. It all works out. Of course your mileage may vary. You have to decide how important your schedule is to you, and be prepared to walk away if they insist on something rigid. If they think it thru carefully, they'll realize that it doesn't matter as long as you put in the time, get your job done, and are willing to be flexible in exceptional cases. 

There is no need to make up excuses or blame anyone. Call the main number of the plant, ask for the manager by name, and eventually talk to him that way. When you talk to him just say "Sorry, I didn't get your cell number from the message.". It happens. There is no need to bring up that you think the reason was that he mumbled. It's irrelevant anyway. If you get his voicemail, just say the same thing in the message. Remember, he wants to hire you and have you get back to him. He would have liked you to call on his cell phone, but that didn't work out. That really shouldn't be a big deal. There should be nothing wrong with work-related communication via his work phone. Perhaps he knows he'll be out of the office, and won't get the message for a while. Send him email also. If he has a secretary, leave a message that way too. With all those, he'll find out you tried to get back to him soon enough. He's certainly not going to figure you gave up on the company and offer the job to someone else before checking his voicemail and email. You are overthinking this. 

Marketing is doing things to promote the sales process. This includes advertising, events like trade shows, special promotions (buy two get third free, but only before June first), etc. All these things are ultimately intended to drive sales. Business development is building the business other ways than just driving sales. This could include alliances with other companies, buying other companies or getting acquired by them, etc. For example, if your product A works together with another type of product B that you don't make, you might work with a company that makes B to offer a bundled deal to both your end customers, or special support built into your A for that specific brand of B, and vice versa. This gives both your companies advantages in competing in their respective spaces. Some things, like setting up new distribution channels could be considered marketing or business development, depending on how the company is structured. 

I would focus on her productivity, not her individual actions. If her productivity is reasonable, then let it go. It's her process of getting more done at other times. If her productivity is low, whether you think it is a result of her chatting or not, address that directly. Have a talk with her about her lower than expected productivity, what is holding her back, and how you can help her. See if she mentions the chatting. If not, bring it up as a possible suggestion as to how to improve her productivity. Do this in a friendly "I'm trying to help you" way. After a reasonable time (a few weeks, a month), sit down with her to re-evaluate her productivity. If it's still low, you can be more authoritative about cutting the chatting. Eventually if her productivity continues to be poor after attempts to fix it, you need to decide whether she's really worth keeping around versus someone else you could get to replace her. 

What exactly is the problem? Having a lot of work available to do is not in itself a problem. As long as you do the amount of work you can get done for the time they pay you for, there is nothing wrong here. What does it matter if a lot more work could have been done if more resources were available to do it? The only potential problem with what you describe is if you are doing a lot of extra work that you are not getting paid for. However, if that's the case, then it's squarely your fault. Going above and beyond occasionally when the company has a particular need is a good thing, which will usually be rewarded down the road in other ways. However, this is always at your option, and is not a good idea to do on a sustained basis. You haven't said that management is insisting you stay late to do extra work, so again, what exactly is the problem here? It is management's job to decide how much resources will be applied to each task, and therefore trade that off with how quickly they get done. You can ask, you can advise, but in the end it's not your call. As long as you're getting paid for what you are doing, there is nothing wrong here. If management is pushing you to put in extra time, simply decline to do it. They are still getting what they are paying for. 

It is often not immediately obvious when reading a email that you got it only because you were on the CC list. Therefore, as a courtesy to those CCed, I usually address the main recipient directly at top. For example, if I'm sending a email to Gustav and CCing to Takashi and Naresh, then I'll start with something like "Gustav, the bobulator is ...". That way Takashi and Naresh immediately see they are being copied in a message from me to Gustav. 

You haven't actually accepted the technician position. Go to the other interview. If you like it and they offer you a good deal, then accept it. Think of the reverse. What if the first place had said, "We really like you, and want to offer you this job, but the dean has to approve it first". Would there be anything wrong with them not eventually making you a real offer? Of course not. Since you gave the first place a vague indication you would accept the offer, it would be polite to inform them you won't be accepting as soon as you have received and accepted another job offer. If they ask why, there is nothing wrong with telling them you found a job for more than double the pay. Keep it factual. Don't make it sound like screw you. They are probably aware they were trying to pay a technician at well below market rate. People bailing when they find a better opportunity is one of the consequences of that. Keep in mind though, you didn't actually bail in this case since you never accepted the job. 

This is tough one. There are some things you can do, but in the end it might not be possible to resolve to your satisfaction. Things to try: Talk to your boss and see if there is some way you can get a private office. I totally understand there are many reason this might not be possible, and not applicable to your situation. However, if there is a corner with a door available somewhere, and your boss understands the problem, maybe he can arrange for you to have your own private space. Ask the boss to at least talk to Bob about this. This is unlikely to have any direct effect, but it will make it easier for you to interrupt Bob when he starts repeating himself and try to move on to the next point. Be more assertive with Bob. He probably won't like it and may get offended, no matter how reasonable the request and politely you do it. You'll probably have to choose between a good relationship with Bob (in his view) and efficient communication. Only you can decide the relative merits of this tradeoff. Sit down yourself with Bob just to discuss this issue. Tell him how much it bothers you, and that from now on you're going to cut the conversation short if you find it's going in circles or not productive. Bob may be on good behavior for a few days, but soon he'll probably fall back into his long-established patterns. He probably can't help himself, and it would be too much trouble for him, even if he could actually recognize the issue as it occurs. 

You're worried about the price of a second monitor? Really!? This is a no-brainer. $300 for a second monitor is nothing compared to the cost of keeping a employee around. I would simply get a bunch and give them to all software developers and anyone else that you think will actually benefit from the second monitor. Shame on you for not making this standard in the first place. If any other employee asks for a second monitor, just give them one. Don't argue, just do it. By the time you make the employee justify how they need the second monitor, you have caused them and you to waste more than its cost, and created negative feelings in the process. Even if you're pretty sure someone doesn't need a second monitor and wouldn't know how to use it if he had it, give him one anyway if he asks. The feeling of support from the company and better all-around moral is worth a lot, versus $300 and employees griping on company time about how only the elite got second monitors, and the overall decrease in moral. Unless someone is asking for $1000 gizmos, not just getting equipment for employees that ask for it is short-sighted, penny-wise, and pound-foolish. For engineers that work for me, I give them a credit card and tell them to not even bother me with anything that is only a few $100. Of course they will be eventually evaluated on how wisely they used this freedom, but I haven't had anyone abuse it yet. I think that is in part because I gave them the trust and freedom to use their own judgement. Your employees know better than you do what is causing them to waste time regularly. Let them make the decisions, with you only stepping in if it seems well out of line. 

As with any presentation, always keep the audience in mind. Never do something because it's "cool" or cutesey. Do it only if you think it will aid in getting the information you are presenting across more accurately, more reliably, keep their attention better, etc. That said 99.9% of all PowerPoint animations are time-wasting attention-dissipating annoyances. Only use animation when there is real benefit in moving images. For example, if you're presenting research on how a bat flaps its wings, showing a slow-motion animation of that, while pointing out features, may be quite useful. Otherwise, animations like the next frame sliding in, then the next one rotating into place, then the next one squeezing in and expanding, or whatever, are great ways to sabotage a presentation. Everyone will be thinking about the animation for the next few seconds at least. You might as well say "Blah, blah, blah" for a little while. Once the mind switches to a new topic (in this case the animation), it becomes free to wander to other topics. Your audience may only be thinking about the animation for a few seconds, but it will take much longer to get them back on track and in sync with your presentation again. Keeping attention with gimmicks like animation is a fallacy. They may look engaged because they're actively looking at the screen, but they won't be engaged with the information you are trying to present. To keep the audience engaged in the right topic, you have to keep stimulating them in that topic and not give their minds opportunities to wander. Any distractions counter that. A quick switch from one slide or picture to the next isn't a distraction, but a fancy animated fade-in is. Don't do it.
