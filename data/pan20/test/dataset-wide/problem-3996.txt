Thanks to the hint of Pr. Karl Schwede, which has also provided a solution in comment, for which the residual field extension is transcendental, I am able to answer to a part of my own question in a very simple way. A posteriori, it may seem that this part is not worthy to appear in this forum, but a priori, it is a fact that nobody has answered or voted against the question. Here is a possible answer : Let $R = \mathbb{Q}[x,y]$, and $\varphi$ the $\mathbb{Q}$-homomorphism from $R$ to $\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\varphi(x) = \varphi(y) = 0$. If $\tilde\varphi$ is a place of $K=\mathbb{Q}(x,y)$ above $\varphi$, then $\tilde\varphi$ corresponds to a valuation $w$ of $K$ such that $w(x) > 0$ and $w(y) > 0$, and conversely, the place associated to a valuation of this form lies above $\varphi$. Fortunately, it is not too much difficult to exhibit explicitely infinitely many valuations of $\mathbb{Q}(x,y)$ of this form (despite I have not seen this immediately). It suffices to define $w(f(x,y))$ in the following way: let $P(x,y)$ be a polynomial, and let $a(i,j)$ be the coefficient of the monomial $x^iy^j$ in $P$. For every $m\in \mathbb N^*$, define $w_m (P) = \min_{a(i,j) \ne 0} i+mj$, and $w(0)=\infty$. Then $w_m$ is easily seen to be a valuation of ${\mathbb Q}[x,y]$ for every $m$, which extends trivially to a valuation of ${\mathbb Q}(x,y)$. It is also clear that $w_m(x)=w_m(y)>0$, so it solves the problem. Unfortunately, the residual field of $\tilde\varphi_a$ is $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ for some variable $t$, so, this does not provide an example of extension whose residual field is a non trivial algebraic extension of ${\rm quot}({\rm Im}(\varphi))$. This part of the question remains, henceforth, open for the moment. 

I am trying to rewrite the theory of decomposition/inertia/ramification groups independently of the theory of Dedekind or valuation rings (I believe this has been done elsewhere, but I found only few results here or there, so any reference will be greatly appreciated). The result is a more general theory, that contains a large part of the same theory in the context of valuations or Dedekind domains. The setup is quite simple : Let $A$ be an integrally closed domain, $K$ its quotient field, $L$ a Galois extension of $K$, $B$ the integral closure of $A$ in $L$, $p$ a prime ideal of $A$, and $P$ a prime ideal of $B$ lying above $A$. The residual field of $p$ is the quotient field of $A/p$, which embeds inside the residual field $P$, defined also as the quotient field of $B/P$. The decomposition group $D$ of $P$ over $K$ is the set of automorphisms $\sigma$ of Gal($L/K$) that stabilize $P$, and the group of inertia $I$ of $P$ in $L$ is the subgroup of elements $\sigma$ of $D$ such that $\sigma x - x$ belong to $P$ for every $x$ in $B$. Everthings works well in the sense that many results of the theory of valuations hold in this setting. Now, suppose that $L/K$ is finite. The residual degre is defined by $f=[{\rm quot}(B/P) : {\rm quot}(A/p)]$ (assuming it is finite). I would like to define a priori the index of ramification of $P$ over $K$ by $|D| = ef$. Here, there are some problems that are my questions : 1) It is not clear if $f$ may be infinite : I can show that $f$ must be finite if [quot($B/P$) : quot($A/p$)] is separable or $B$ is Noetherian. But in the general case, is there an exemple of infinite residual degree in this setting? 2) Somewhat related to this question: if it can be shown that there is a valuation that extends the canonical surjection $A\to A/p$ to $K$, whose residual field is is a finite extension of quot($A/p$), then (1) could be shown to be true. But in fact, I would be happy to have an example of such an extension by valuation whose residual field is an infinite algebraic extension over $K$, just to know if this can hold. 2) Assuming $f$ finite, it is not clear if or if not $e$ must be an integer (I can show that it must be if the residual field extension is separable, because it is then equal to the cardinal of the inertia group). This does not prevent the multiplicativity of this index, but it is important for further developments to know if or if not it must be an integer (in other words, if or if not the residual degree divides |D|). Any idea will be welcome. N.B : 1) If this can help, I have proved that $|I| = e p^s$, where $p={\rm char}({\rm quot}(A/p))$ and $p^s=[{\rm quot}(B/P):{\rm quot}(A/p)]_{\rm insep}$. 2) Even if the question is weakened by assuming $p$ maximal in $A$ and $P$ maximal in $B$, (so $A/p$ and $B/P$ are fields), it remains of interest for me. 

Partial answer, in the case where the norm space = $R$. Let us define condition $\cal C$ by $||x-y||= n$ â‡” $||f(x)-f(y)|| = n$. Assume that the normed space is $R$, so that the norm is of the form $\lambda|*|$ with $\lambda > 0$. w.l.g, I assume that the norm is the usual absolute value. Let $h(t)$ be a continuous bijection $[0,1]\to [0,1]$, such that $h(0)=0$, $h(1)=1$ and $0\leq h(t)<1$. Then the function defined by $f(k+t) = k + h(t)$ ($0\leq t<1$) is continuous and satisfies condition $\cal C$. This shows that there can be no proper condition such that, added to condition $\cal C$, leads to an isometry. In other words, in the case where the normed space is $R$ every such condition will be equivalent to "$f$ is an isometry", independently of condition $\cal C$. If you take $h$ to be diffentiable in $[0,1]$, with right differential at 0 equal to its left differential at 1, then the same could be said with the additional assumption "$f$ differentiable". Notice also that it can be shown that every continuous function that satisfy $\cal C$ must be of the form above, or of the form $f(k+t)=-(k + h(t))$. For general normed space, I suggest to work first the case of a two-dimensional normed space, with the euclidean norm. If it can be shown that a continuous $f$ that satisfies condition $\cal C$ must be an isometry, it will be probably easy to show the same in general normed space. 

Observe that $e$ sends an element $\downarrow \alpha$ to an element of the form $\downarrow \alpha'$, and an element $\downarrow \beta$ to an element of the form $\downarrow \beta'$. Now, if $x'$ and $y'$ are distinct in $Q$, and if $x,y$ are such that $e(x)=x'$ and $e(y)=y'$, then there exists a finite intersection $U$ of the elements of the sub base you gave above, and a finite intersection $V$ of these elements, such that $U\cap V = \emptyset$. Let us denote $U=u_1\cap u_2\cap\ldots\cap u_k$, with $u_i = P-s_i$ and $s_i=\downarrow \alpha$ or $s_i=\uparrow \alpha$, and $V = v_1\cap \ldots v_r$, with $v_j = P - t_j$ and $ t_j=\downarrow \beta$ or $t_i = \uparrow \beta$. Then by booleanity, $P=\cup_i s_i \cup \cup_j t_j$. It follows that $e(P)=Q=\cup_i e(s_i) \cup \cup_j e(t_j)$, and conclude by booleanity that $Q$ is Hausdorff. 

Here is one possible condition: If $f(x)$ is continuous and fulfills $||f(kx)-f(ky)|| = k||f(x)-f(y)||$, for every $k \in N$. This works because : 1) the equivalence you wrote above will be true not only for $n\in N$ but also for every positive rational number $n$ (easy to check) 2) it will be in fact true for all positive real number $n$ : recall that the norm is continuous and take the limit of a sequence $(x_m,y_m)$ such that $x_m\to x$, $y_m\to y$, $||x_m-y_m||\in \mathbb Q$, and $||x_m-y_m||\to ||x-y||$ (such a sequence exists because the subspace spanned by $x,y$ is isometric to $\mathbb R^2$, endowed with the transported norm, equivalent to any other norm in $\mathbb R^2$). You can even restrict this condition to hold only whenever $||kx - ky||$ is a natural number, and not for all $x,y$. To sum up, $f$ is an isometry if and only if $f$ is continuous, $||x-y|| = n$ implies $||f(x)-f(y)||=n$ for all $n\in N$ and $||f(kx)-f(ky)|| = k ||f(x)-f(y)||$ holds for all $k\in N$. Notice also that if your relation holds for every rational number $n$ and $f$ is continuous, then $f$ is an isometry by continuity. 

I assume $p$ odd. 1) Setting $s=p+1$, it is easy to show that $p+1$ is coprime to $\frac{p^n+1}{p+1} = \frac{(s-1)^n+1}{s}$ (use binome formula). 2) There is a generalization of a theorem known to Fermat, by which he canceled primes in some expressions : Theorem : Assume that $a$ and $b$ are two integers and $n$ is a prime number. Then every prime divisor of $a^n-b^n$ that does not divide $a-b$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $n$ (check it). Applying this with $a=p$ and $b=-1$, and taking (1) into account, you get that every prime that divide $\frac{p^n+1}{p+1}$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $n$ for every prime $n$. In particular, they must be of the form $1+kn > n$. So the answer to your two questions, when $n$ is prime, is that this occurs each time $\frac{p^n+1}{p+1}$ does not reduce to a single prime. 

For every prime $k = -1 \mod 4$, and every primitive root $a$ modulo $p$, the polynomials $P(x) = 1 + x^{a^2} + x^{a^4} + ... + x^{a^{k-1}}$ and $Q(x) = 1 + x^a + x^{a^3}+\cdots+ x^{a^{k-2}}$ are magicals (of course, reduce the exponents modulo $k$ in order to make the degrees of the polynomials $<k$). Indeed, it is easy to see that $\overline{P(\omega)} = Q(\omega)$ (because the conjugation sends $\omega$ to $\omega^{-1}=\omega^{a^{\frac{k-1}{2}}}$). Every automorphism of the galois group of ${\mathbb Q}(\omega)/{\mathbb Q}$ sends $\omega$ (a primitive element of the extension) to $w^{a^i}$ for some $i$. So, the expression $|P(\omega)|^2=P(\omega)Q(\omega)$ is fixed by the Galois group, hence belongs to $\mathbb Q$. Therefore, $|P(\omega)|^2\in {\mathbb Q} \cap Z[\omega] = Z$ because $Z$ is integrally closed (a consequence, say, of the symmetric functions theorem). Thus $|P(\omega)|^2 \in \mathbb N$ and $|Q(\omega)|^2\in \mathbb N$, as desired. Next, for every prime $k = 5 \mod 8$, and every primitive root $a$ modulo $p$, the polynomials $P_1(x) = 1 + x^{a} + x^{a^5} + x^{a^9} + \cdots$, $Q_1(x) = 1 + x^{a^2} + x^{a^{6}} + x^{a^{10}} + \cdots $, and $P_2(x) = 1 + x^{a^3} + x^{a^7} + x^{a^{11}} + \cdots$ $Q_2(x) = 1 + x^{a^4} + x^{a^8} + x^{a^{12}} + \cdots $, are (not checked very carefully) magicals. You have to use the pigeon hole principle to show first that $P_1P_2(\omega) = Q_1Q_2(\omega)$ (let me leave this point, this may be wrong for every $p=5\mod 8$, even if it is true for some primes like p=13). Once this is done, it is easily seen that the complex conjugation sends $P_1(\omega)$ to $P_2(\omega)$, and $Q_1(\omega)$ to $Q_2(\omega)$. The generator $\omega\to \omega^a$ of the cyclic Galois group sends $P_1$ to $Q_1$ and $P_2$ to $Q_2$. Hence $P_1P_2$ and $Q_1Q_2$ are fixed by the Galois group, and the conclusion follows as previously. These cases cover the given examples.
