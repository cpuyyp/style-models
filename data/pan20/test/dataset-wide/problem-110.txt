As for the rust issue, I'd be surprised if any outdoor automatons weren't properly weather proofed & would expect plastics & other non-ferrous materials (fiberglass, carbon fiber, etc) to be the norm for outer casings. 500 years may be stretching things a bit though, they still need maintenance & repair so you'll need to have had a lot of automated repair shops out there before the fall as well. And if the power industry is sufficiently automated to keep running with no people there's no reason the mining, refining, machine parts & electronics industry won't be as well so your repair shops stay fully stocked, they should even be able turn out new units to order (from their own, other household & factory supervisor software*) as needed. *A unit like the Amazon Alexa can already be set up to place online orders to automatically restock your fridge for you (which might then be delivered by drone) & it's really no different from that. 

The point is, if you are using a weapon that can shoot five laser beams per clip, with each laser beam carrying around 1 gigajoule of energy... Then your clips have, at least and assuming 100% efficiency, five gigajoules of energy. That's a ridiculous amount of energy to carry. Doesn't matter if you are using anti-matter or not, high-powered batteries are dangerous. Modern batteries have several self-regulating mechanisms that work really hard to keep the energy inside it stable. The energy on a battery wants to go out, and wants do so explosively, most of the time! With such an amount of energy, it becomes almost impossible to make a stable, safe battery that is to be carried around by a soldier on the battlefield. Laser Weapons are fancy and really interesting from a sci-fi point of view, but really, they are really, really hard to explain in a hard-science way. My suggestion to you is that, if you want to keep you laser weapons, don't try to explain the power source. Handwaving the source of the pew-pews worked for Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke, it may work for you too! 

How about a custard filled ballistic vest? What you may be looking for is a non newtonian fluid, something that stiffens when sudden kinetic force is applied to it (like custard). So you might imagine a vest made of sealed sections (pockets or cells) & each of these sections filled with such a fluid. You couldn't shoot the wearer (through the vest) but you could stab him (through the vest), if you stab slowly enough (this is almost exactly the effect of the shields in Dune). For the actual material of the vest you probably can't beat Demigan's suggested spider silk, but I wouldn't know which of our currently available non newtonian fluids is best to fill it's pockets with. It probably won't stop the effect of a bullet completely but it will take some of the kinetic force out (redistribute it sideways) & the forward force that's left (probably most of it?) will be spread over a much larger area of the body so it'll be (a little bit) more like being hit by a flat plank of wood than shot with a bullet (so sort of a full body airbag for bullets), a lot less lethal. On the down side I'm not sure we have anything right now that would provide sufficient stopping power for what you want to it's own weight in ratios that would make such an armor even slightly reasonable for a person to wear & move in though. Edit: rereading your question, my answer will only fit the bullets in your question.. if you really mean to include tanks & gas & weren't just getting a little excited & giving way to a touch of hyperbole as you typed then there's nothing, you want magic. It seems this idea was already very much in the design stage if not in production as far back as 2006 (see Liquid Bullet-Proof Armour), and it seems much lighter & more flexible than I thought it could be with currently available materials (while still retaining adequate utility). 

(Sorry for the broken english, it's not my first language!) Give the tree a public utility that correlates to it's size. The bigger it is, the most the people benefit, and thus there is a direct interest to make it grow. Alternatively, you can replace the Corporate thing with a religious theme for the same overall effect. I would go with money, however, as it is easier to convince the government to cooperate when there is a direct monetary benefit in game. 

Still, I really want to make them usable on my sci-fantasy setting on a more realistic way, and maybe even craft a realistic pair of those for a more sci-fi cosplay. I know that, as designed originally on those games, warglaives would suck. Like, really suck. However, we are the Worldbuilding community, and making sucky things work is one of the things we do best. With that said, I enlist your help: Without resorting to magic and using modern manufactory materials and techniques, how one could make usable Warglaives? Keep in mind they are supposed to be used in pairs! 

Possible yes, but a good idea probably not. Bones are calcium, this is a mineral, it's a metal actually. If organic biology can lay down one mineral then there's no reason to suppose evolution couldn't develop organisms that lay down other minerals. Aside from the utility & usefulness of those other minerals to an organism as dictated by mother nature through evolution & natural selection of course. There are in fact examples of other minerals laid down by organisms in the real world, some snails that live around deep sea vents do actually grow their shells out of another metal. The only real question is would this other mineral provide an evolutionary edge to the organism that uses it for it's bones, most crystal probably isn't a good choice, at least not for bones, your diamond bones may be hard but will also be brittle, so lateral blows to long bones are pretty likely to cause it to shatter far more easily than our calcium bones, possibly not a good idea then. 

Those weapons appear in several games, sometimes using other names or with some minor design changes. Below is a similar weapon, the Faeblade, from Kingdoms of Amalur, which illustrates how those are supposed to be hold. More often than not, they are the coolest thing you have chance of putting your hands on. They are swift, fast, agile blades that deal a lot of damage using all sorts of acrobatic strikes. However, warglaives are a strange type of weapon. They have two massive, curved blades to the each side of the hilt. The outer side of the blade has a cutting edge that is used to perform slashing attacks, and the two points can be used for quick stabs. They are also used in pairs, with one of those double blades in each hand for mayhem. At least, in the theory. I started to craft a pair of wooden warglaives for a friend's demon hunter cosplay, and while building them several problems showed up on how they are designed. 

All that aside (as dot_Sp0T said in comments) with the level of sophistication your robots have it seems silly to assume they wouldn't be able to repair themselves or at least book themselves into the nearest local automated repair shop as needed. Oh! and go read Autofac by Philip K. Dick, he beat you to this story (pretty much) by decades. 

If you want to get silly you could even have your bots powered (indirectly) by ethanol & bio-diesel, a whole automated farming & industry chain producing crops, processing them into fuel & delivering it to the power stations, with the power flowing back to the abandoned cities & homes the bots inhabit through the remnants of the bot maintained national grid, where they plug in to recharge. 

You might consider a combination of broadcast (as used by "the internet of things") & solar power, besides that, with as many robots propping up the economy & industry before the fall (as you say) it may not be (too) far fetched to say the power industry was fully automated, so they could all just be plugging themselves in at night all over the country to recharge like good little domestic appliances. Other good power sources for you include thermoelectric (also called Seebeck) generators & types of broadcast power "tuned" to generate power from background radiation or else from infrared light, no transmitting station is needed for any of those & they never run out, though your bots may have long periods of downtime while they recharge with these ones.
