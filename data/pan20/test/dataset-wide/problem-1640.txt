Several researchers have noted that during the last 25 years in US, portion sizes of commercially available foods have increased in parallel with the increase of the incidence of overweight and obesity. One study among men and women 19 to 80 years of age has found that the frequency of consuming restaurant food is positively associated with body fatness. Another study has found that, in women, frequent consumption of meals at fast food establishments is associated with increased BMI (kilograms per meters squared), and in men, eating at both restaurants and fast food establishments is associated with increased BMI. In the year 2000, Americans spent 47% of their food expenditures on foods consumed away from home, and this proportion continues to increase. When consumers eat away from home, they are offered a large variety of low-cost, energy dense foods in large portions; all of these factors may encourage overconsumption of energy and lead to obesity. 

There is no evidence that shade balls have degraded into "micro-plastics.‚Äù since this method was initiated in 2008. 

"Organic produce consistently has lower levels of pesticide residues than does conventionally grown produce and a diet of organic produce reduces human exposure" Joel Forman, 2012. A study has found a link between diet and exposure to specific pesticides, particularly synthetic organophosphorus pesticides. The researchers Lu C, 2006 et al found that switching children from a conventional food diet to an entirely organic diet dropped the urinary levels of specific pesticide metabolites for malathion and chlorpyrifos to nondetectable levels in days. However, it's important to note that the pesticide levels these researchers detected during the conventional diet are several orders of lower magnitude than the levels needed in animal experiments to cause neurodevelopmental or other adverse health effects. 

B. Movement of the phosphine gas floating off the water surface. Phosphine is slightly more volatile than methane, but this explanation should require special circumstances to be consistent over time. 

India's temple trust has a revenue which is twice than that of foreign donations received by Christian organizations. 

Gwendolyn L Gilbert concluded in 2015 that there is no risk in stopping an antibiotic course immediately and minimal risk if there is resolution of symptoms of mild infection. 

The carcinogenic effects of organic pesticides are not yet thoroughly studied and known when compared to synthetic chemical pesticides. Also it should not be commonly or generally assumed that all "natural products are uniformly safer, and thus more environmentally friendly, than synthetic chemicals" since research into a particular class of natural pesticides proved the opposite. 

In nature or the wild, the wolf pack is usually a family unit which consists of pair of breeders and their young offspring which was previously observed by other researchers such as Muries in 1944, Young and Goldman in 1944, Clark in 1971 and Haber in 1977. 

Employees often used music to seal themselves off from the office environment per the findings of a 2011 survey of 295 office employees in the UK for listening patterns. 

Research shows that there are significant effects shown by nicotine administration on pre-attentional processing, attention and distraction. However, those effects are noted to be prompt but inefficient. 

TL;DR: Research backed up evidence such as one previously mentioned by user Oddthinking and others show a non-paternity rate between 1% and 3% for the general population and as of 2008, the non-paternity rate reported by United States paternity testing laboratories was 25.9 per cent found in a group of people who have doubts about the paternity of a child or children. 

Although it is not proven by research at this point that converting handedness causes memory disorders, it is notable that there are differences between the structures of the brain adult "converted" left-handers and consistent right- and left-handers for a specific task of handwriting. (Correlation does not imply causation) Advise from both medical professionals and logical reasoning is that it is best not to force children to change their "natural" handedness. 

When a group of people laugh, people will look at the person they feel closest to in that group due to interest indicators per supporting research by Norman P. Li et.al. in 2009. "Humor plays a large role in our everyday lives and is pervasive across all cultures. We seek and rapidly notice humor whether we are going to the movies, interacting with a stranger or a friend, or looking for a potential romantic partner." The interest indicator model suggests that humor can function as a key tool for both facilitating and maintaining social relationships within a group of people. The interest indicator model also proposes that humor is inherently different from intelligent conversation and serves an important function beyond courtship or intrasexual competition. Humor also functions to indicate interest in social relationships to initiate new relationships and to monitor existing ones. Co-evolution of laughter and language, humor initiation and appreciation may have developed as a way for individuals to initiate and maintain different social relationships. 

Human muscular performance might be markedly inferior to that of chimpanzees and macaque monkeys per a study of metabolome evolution conducted in three brain regions and two non-neural tissues from humans, chimpanzees, macaque monkeys, and mice based on over 10,000 hydrophilic compounds by Katarzyna Bozek et.al. in 2014. The results suggest that "while humans are characterized by superior cognition, their muscular performance might be markedly inferior to that of chimpanzees and macaque monkeys." 

Restriction on total fat indirectly leads people to consume large amounts of refined carbohydrates containing starch and added sugar. 

An OTC EMS device cleared by FDA for toning, strengthening and firming abdominal muscles is Slendertone Flex marketed by BMR NeuroTech Inc. Regarding the claim of weight loss and minimizing body fat using EMS devices, per FDA, "While an EMS device may be able to temporarily strengthen, tone or firm a muscle, no EMS devices have been cleared at this time for weight loss, girth reduction, or for obtaining "rock hard" abs". Also per FDA, "Applying electrical current to muscles may cause muscles to contract. Stimulating muscles repeatedly with electricity may eventually result in muscles that are strengthened and toned to some extent but will not, based on currently available data, create a major change in your appearance without the addition of diet and regular exercise. The effect of using these devices is primarily to help a patient recover from impaired muscle function due to a medical condition, not to increase muscle size enough to affect appearance." Regarding efficacy of EMS using EMS devices, approval pending EMS devices listed here have a 510(k) number which refers to a premarket submission made to FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval. Submitters must compare their devices to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalency claims when they submit the 510(k) application. Use of FDA approved EMS devices is recommended as safe since per FDA, "Using a product that has not met FDA requirements isn't necessarily unsafe or dangerous. But it could be. FDA has received reports of shocks, burns, bruising, skin irritation, pain, and interference with other critically important medical devices (e.g., pacemakers) associated with the use of unregulated products. Unregulated devices also may have safety problems associated with cables and leads that can lead to accidental shock and electrocution by users and other household members, including children." Recent research into EMS indicates that, 1. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation for enhancing performance is not convincingly supported by evidence. Per systematic review by Malone, John K et.al. in 2014, evidence is not convincing to support NMES for enhancing subsequent performance.although there may be some subjective benefits for postexercise recovery. 

The referred source claims that the ID card for the school's students combines radio frequency identification (RFID) and GPS technologies. There are currently no known consumer GPS receivers (fitting on a chip/ID card) that can receive a remote signal and respond with its position (transmitting location) to an outside receiver. The market available RFID GPS integrated hybrids work for asset management and logistics.

'Pseudo-translation as a Subset of the Literary System: a Case Study' by the author Maryam Mohammadi Dehcheshmeh concluded in 2013 that 'the Letter of Charlie Chaplin to his daughter Geraldine' was one of the most famous Iranian pieces of 'pseudo-translations'. The original writer Farajollah Saba has claimed the letter's authorship in 2012. Pseudo-translations as classified by Tahir Gurcaglar (2010) are a type of purported translated text even as there is no original text for them. The text is not the original but rather an English translation which was found by analysis focus including the content and the terminology of the text but not the syntax. Farajollah Saba, in an interview with Serat News on May 23, 2012 speaks that 

Per Alan Walker in April 2009 issue of Current Anthropology, humans may lack the strength of chimps because human nervous system exerts more control over human muscles. Human fine motor control allows to perform delicate and uniquely human tasks while preventing great feats of strength when compared to chimps. Walker's hypothesis is derived partly from a finding by primatologist Ann MacLarnon. MacLarnon showed that relative to body mass, chimps have much less grey matter in their spinal cords than humans. Spinal grey matter contains large numbers of motor neurons nerves cells that connect to muscle fibers and regulate muscle movement. Walker proposes that more grey matter in humans means more motor neurons and having more motor neurons means more muscle control. According to Walker, human surplus motor neurons allows to engage smaller portions of muscles at any given time and the finely-tuned motor system makes a wide variety of human tasks possible such as manipulating small objects, making complex tools or throwing accurately. Due to conservation of energy by using muscle gradually, humans seem to have more physical endurance. "Great apes, with their all-or-nothing muscle usage, are explosive sprinters, climbers and fighters, but not nearly as good at complex motor tasks." 

The explanation provided above can also be verified by reading page 69 of the 2004 book 'Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World" by Jack Weatherford. 

Exposure to hard water is considered to be a risk factor for eczema by studies on atopic eczema among Japanese, Nottinghamshire and Spanish children. Water hardness may increase the risk of atopic dermatitis among elementary-school children in Japan, as well as in the United Kingdom. Potential health impacts on consumption of hard water are discussed here. 

Switched individuals share both left-hander and right-hander features regarding their motor control architecture and hand preference profiles. 

The research into effectiveness of fairness creams such as Fair & Lovely is inconclusive since Aneel Karnani's 2007 paper states that dermatologists claim that fairness creams cannot be effective without the use of skin bleaching agents such as hydroquinone, steroids, mercury salts, other harmful chemicals and further research is warranted. "Skin-lightening or fairness creams are big business in India, an over $200 million industry that comprises the largest segment of the country‚Äôs skin cream market. Although corporations like Unilever have been widely criticized for profiting on colorism, they continue to produce advertisements that equate light skin with beauty, success, and empowerment." The marketing company Unilever has not been required to prove efficacy of Fair & Lovely creams since Fair & Lovely is not categorized as a pharmaceutical product. Per P. Ravi Shankar et. al in 2007, "the melanocytes in the epidermis are responsible for the intensity of skin colour. The number of melanocytes is the same in both fair and dark skinned people. The amount of melanin produced by the melanocytes is partly determined by genetics and partly by the environment." Per Aneel Karnani in 2007, "the melanin in an individual‚Äôs skin cannot be reduced by applying fairness creams, bathing with sun-blocking soaps or using fairness talc. The upper layer of skin is dead tissue, below which is a barrier zone that prevents foreign particles from entering the body. Only if a substance penetrates this barrier zone, can it reach the melanin. Medicated ointments that contain chemicals which aid in skin absorption may have some effect."

He also believes that the 1 in 20 figure is a minimum. Per his guesses, it may also be 1 in 15 but not as high as 1 in 10. 

Emblica officinalis (of the family Euphorbiaceae) also known as Indian gooseberry in the form of fruits contain mostly carbohydrate with moderate fiber content and are rich in vitamin C, with some other unique bioactives. Emblica officinalis extract is Generally Recognized As Safe as a food additive by FDA. The effects listed below were noted in uncontrolled or observational studies only and more research is needed for conclusion of evidence of the effects. Hair Application of the Emblica officinalis fruit extract in solution to mice was found to increase hair follicle count and was second best to ethanolic extract of Carthamus tinctorius from safflower. Skin Emblica officinalis appears to be capable of protecting skin cells from UV radiation by reducing the increase in reactive oxygen species which is researched here and here. 

Per Shashi K. in 2013, drinking coffee has been linked with a reduced incidence of basal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colon, breast and rectal cancers. However per Weixiang Wu et.al. in 2015, there was an increased risk between coffee consumption and bladder cancer. More health effects of coffee drinking are discussed on basis of science here and its followup here. 

David Brenner director of the Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research director also disputes the study's findings saying that the study makes no effort to trace the exposure of patients.
