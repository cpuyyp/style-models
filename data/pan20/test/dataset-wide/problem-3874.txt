This idea just occurred to me this evening. I imagine the answer depends on the axioms for the closure operator. Has this topic already been explored? Thanks for any help or references. 

Background/motivation: A model for the classical propositional calculus is a boolean function b(S) which assigns 1 or 0 to each (modal-free) sentence S according to the usual rules. I'm looking at models for propositional modal logic, where a modal model is simply a collection of classical models as points. These simplified models make no use of a relation R that holds between points, nor of any one point as designated. How many modal models are there? I have two answers: 1) There are continuously many (c) classical models. Since any subset of the collection of classical models is a modal model, there are (2^c) > c modal models. 2) Suppose that for any given collection B = {b1, b2, ...} of classical models, the product of the collection B is defined as a function f(S) such that for each sentence S: 

Suppose I alter their definitions slightly so the above properties are all defined for filters in general, then modify the lemma to assert that it holds for filters in general. Would that be true? Can anyone supply a reference to a proof or disproof? Thanks. 

Since the function f(S) has a countable infinity of inputs and only finitely many outputs, it appears there are continuously many such functions. (Perhaps this assumes AC?) The two answers can be reconciled if two different collections B1 and B2 of classical models both define the same function f(S). But I don't see how that's possible. So there's something I'm missing. 

Background/motivation: I'm investigating the construction of models for a first-order modal system (S5) as products of classical models. Since ultraproducts are all classical models and I need non-classical ones as well, I need to look at reduced products where the filter is not an ultrafilter. This leads me to ask about filters in general: J.L. Bell & A.B. Slomson, in Models and Ultraproducts (p. 116), state and prove: 

An excellent reference explaining the history and significance of the Stone von Neumann theorem is Jonathan Rosenberg's "A Selective History of the Stone-von Neumann Theorem" available at $URL$ Note that one doesn't actually have uniqueness of representations of the position and momentum operators (since they're unbounded). The theorem applies to their exponentiated versions, which give the Heisenberg (mathematician's name) or Weyl (physicist's name) group. 

To see why the spinor bundle is the bundle $\Omega^{0,* }\otimes K^{1/2}$, you need to understand the relation between the spinor representation $S$ of $Spin(2n)$ and the exterior algebra representations $\Lambda^* (\mathbf C^n)$ of $U(n)$. If you choose an orthogonal complex structure $J$ on $\mathbf R^{2n}$, this picks out a subgroup $U(n)\subset SO(2n)$, with double-cover $\widetilde{U(n)}\subset Spin(2n)$. The notion of a "square root of the top exterior power" $(\Lambda^n(\mathbf C^n))^{1/2}$ makes sense as a $\widetilde{U(n)}$ representation. One finds (by computing characters, or from your favorite construction of the spinor representation) that, restricted to $\widetilde{U(n)}$, the spinor representation $S$ of $Spin(2n)$ is $\Lambda^* (\mathbf C^n)\otimes (\Lambda^n(\mathbf C^n))^{-1/2}$ There's more about this in some of my class notes here $URL$ I learned this first from some beautiful lectures of Atiyah which explicitly discuss the Dirac/Dolbeault operator relation, see "Classical groups and classical differential operators on manifolds" CIME, Varenna (1975). 

$G/T$ is a co-adjoint orbit in $\mathfrak g^*$. The normal bundle to the inclusion $G/T\rightarrow \mathfrak g^*$ is trivial, so the tangent bundle of $G/T$ is stably trivial. This implies its Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin classes vanish. (Argument stolen from Dan Freed "Flag Manifolds and Infinite Dimensional Geometry" in MSRI proceedings volume "Infinite Dimensional Groups with Applications".) 

One answer that hasn't appeared here yet is that $\rho$ is the highest weight of a spinor representation. Instead of the Dolbeault operator on the flag manifold, one can work with the Dirac operator. This leads to the subject of "Dirac Cohomology", see the book "Dirac Operators in Representation Theory". Here, instead of working with the Universal Enveloping Algebra and modules for it, one works with the tensor product of this with a Clifford algebra. Irreducible modules then acquire a spinor representation factor. This explains nicely the shift by $\rho$. Hopefully this spring I'll finish this, which explains all this in more detail: $URL$ 

In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

Is there anyone familiar with this paper? It seems to me it contains "some" typos and even some small elementary mistakes, which makes my reading very slow. Of course the key reason for my slow reading is I wasn't familiar with Faltings and Chai's book, from which the paper use the notations and results. Maybe I have some (or many) misunderstanding. I hope someone could help me clear up my confusions: 

I am interested in the following example! Let $k$ be a field, let $X_0$ be the scheme $\mathrm{Spec}R$ with $R_0=k[x,y]/(xy)$, let $R$ be the strict Hensilian localalisation of $R_0$ at the origin and $X=\mathrm{Spec}R$, we define a sheaf $F$ on $X$ by $F(U)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ for $U$ open in $X$ depending on if $U$ contains the origin or not (hence the stalk of $F$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at the origin, and $\mathbb{Z}$ at other points). The restriction maps for defining $F$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}:(m,n)\mapsto m+n$ (in fact the sheaf comes from the log structure associated to the embedding $X_0\subset \mathbb{A}^2$ ). Since $X$ is strict Hensilian, we have $H^1(X,F)=0$. Now consider the projection $p:\mathbb{G}_{m,R}\rightarrow X=\mathrm{Spec}R$. What would be the group $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},p^*F)$? Maybe an easier version, is $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},\mathbb{Z})$ zero? We do know $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m},\mathbb{Z})=H^1(\mathrm{Spec}R,\mathbb{Z})=0$! 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$?
