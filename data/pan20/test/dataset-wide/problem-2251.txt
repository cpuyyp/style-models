I don't know if this is local to New Zealand, but this is fairly common practice for both shore-based and boat anglers. You can either buy or make a Berley Bomb, which is exactly this. It is ground up fish / blood / bits frozen into a block, then hung in the water to defrost and disperse. If you are surfcasting, you can put one out a few hours before you start fishing to get fish to gather nearby. 

This may not be the most efficient, but is something I have done with the gear I am always carrying - which to me is more important. On any route where I will be abseiling (or may need to ascend) I always carry my Reverso, as well as a Shunt (or smaller / lighter equivalent device). I use the shunt while abseiling in place of a prusik. I generally have a prusik as well, but never use it. I suspect this isn't recommended by manufacturers, but in a pinch I can turn my belay device into second mode, and connect my shunt above it. I use the biner on the shunt as a hand ascender, and attach a sling as a foot loop. Ensuring to tie back up knots off as I go, I can then ascend a rope with only that which I am usually carrying. As well as this if my second is having issues on a pitch, with my belay device in self locking mode I can connect my shunt to the climbers ropes, clip the dead end of the rope through the shunt biner, and have created a 3 way pulley and can haul a climber through a crux in seconds. If this is unclear and you are interested, I can attach diagrams later. 

The different types of snowboards are: All-mountain: Versatile snowboards that can be used on all parts of the mountain, including machine-groomed runs, backcountry, and park and pipe. Freestyle: Boards that are light, short, and flexible, and ideal for terrain parks and doing tricks (riding rails, jibbing, etc) Freeride: Boards that are ideal for backcountry riding and going fast on groomed runs. Splitboards: Boards that can split in half for backcountry climbing. Powder: Boards that will spend most of their time in deep powder. They have wide waists, wide noses, and are generally rocker shaped to prevent the edges from catching. Sourced from REI. 

Ive heard that climbing Kilimanjaro doesn't require any mountaineering skills and is really just a (very difficult) hike? Is that true? Is there any gear I would need besides traditional hiking equipment? 

The most common for rock climbing are with fingerboards or campus boards. Without those, you can perform dead hangs on anything you can hold onto, such as pullup bars. To make it a little more difficult, you can dead hang on the edges of doorways. There are other handheld devices for grip strengthening, such as tiger claws. Lastly, wrist curls with dumbbells will also strengthen forearms which will help when climbing. 

Typically a tent itself will not let mosquitos in, but if you are in a tent that will, like a canvas army tent, hanging nets does a decent job. In some situations a bivy may do better. Some are primarily made of netting and designed specifically for bugs, and some are even shaped to fit standard military cots. I have had some luck with fabric treatments. Permethrin sprays are available for clothing and some may work on tents or netting. Follow the instructions on the bottle regarding fabric compatibility. 

I use both cortisone and benedryl cream. One reduces swelling, the other reduces the allergic reaction. Make sure to only use water soluble creams! Petroleum based lotions will block the skin from naturally expunging the poison ivy oil. 

Hammocks are great for hot weather. I have backpacked with a hammock in the Virginia summer, when the nights were 85°F-95°. There are certainly enough trees here, and in any densely forested area. It is actually preferable (with a mosquito net) because you stay cooler. When it rained, I slept on the ground with a small rain fly, because water likes to come down from the attachment points. Bivys pack so small that if one were concerned about the weather, you could pack both in less space than a full sized tent. 

I'm planning a whitewater rafting trip, and I'm worried what I should do if the raft flips over. Is there a standard set of procedures I should go through to get back on the raft? 

Personally, I've found it useful to have just a footprint when backpacking or camping in mild climates to reduce the carrying weight. While just a rainfly and footprint won't keep bugs out, it will protect you from rain and wind, and will be much lighter without all of the tent fabric. With the potential for severe weather conditions, however I would bring a complete tent. 

which I used when I am belaying someone who is top roping or leading. However, my rope only goes through one of those slots. What is the purpose of the other one? 

When navigating in the backcountry, you'll usually bring a topographic map that shows the terrain so you can tell if there will be steep slopes or cliffs that might make the route difficult. A sample topographic map is: 

I hike quite a bit in Vibram Fivefinger Kimodo Sports. Like the KSO, they are covered and don't have a problem with rocks getting in. I strongly prefer them to boots for marked trails, and would like to find ways of using them for some moderate trail-less backcountry hiking. How can I protect myself from scratches? Will gaiters work, or wear out underfoot without the sole gap provided by boots? 

Two considerations: Layers should be loose and non-constricting so as to allow good circulation. Too many layers can get tight. Also, day clothes will be damp, even if you think they aren't. Air them before bringing them into your bag if it is cold. 

I have researched this occasionally over the years. Ivy Block, Tecnu, and Ivarest all have preventative lotions. The oil may still spread, but it is a good first step. As an alternative, the forest service has recommended spray deodorant as well. The active ingredient, aluminum chlorohydrate, may prevent absorption by blocking pores, just as it does to prevent sweating. None of these methods will prevent you from spreading the oil to some extent once in contact, but may help protect the treated area.
