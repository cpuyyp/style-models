In this edited image, I've straightened the boot-covered stanchion so it aligns with the head tube. Then a second bend where the crown meets the tube to add caster to the fork. (Either way, it looks to me like substantially more than a 5-15 mm! That would barely be noticeable in the image. Do they mean 5-15 mm total displacement at the drop-out?) Like anything else, this requires a careful inspection and diagnosis, so that a well-targeted and cost-effective repair can be performed. 

That chain is sitting quite well on the front ring, almost perfectly, as far as can be discerned in the photo. In particularly, it doesn't appear to be elongated at all, which is usually the telltale sign of chain wear. When a chain is elongated, you can easily tell on the front ring, because it has so many teeth that the cumulative error of the elongated links causes it not to sit properly all the way around the ring. I'm guessing you (or a previous owner) replaced the chain, possibly more than once, but didn't swap the rear cog at the same time. That's a mistake. Chains elongate as they wear, and at the same time, they wear the cog, and are worn by the cog. A chain which wore together with the cog might not skip, yet if you change to a new chain, that chain will skip on that old cog. I've never been able to change a chain alone, without skipping cogs. (That is, the few times that I tried, before I stopped doing that). Do check the tension! But note that chains don't have that much tension in derailleur systems (just that tension provided by the tension wheel) yet they don't skip, when in the proper condition. Basically there has to be ridiculously low tension. It's hard to tell from your picture, but it does look as if the chain is coming from the ring in a fairly straight line, no sag. Anyway, when you're pedaling hard, there is tension in the top section of the chain, between the ring teeth and the cog. Under this tension, they stay engaged even if the returning-to-ring section of the chain is sagging. If you don't believe me, think about this: when you remove a cassette from a hub on a derailleur system, you open a lock ring, for which you require a chain whip to hold the hub steady. That chain whip is just a piece of chain connected to a lever, loosely wrapped one of the cogs in the cassette: no tension in it at all, other than the applied tension. Nothing pulls on the unattached end of the chain to keep it wrapped around the cog! Yet, it grips tenaciously, enough to remove a stubborn lock ring. I've never had a chain whip skip, even when ridiculous force was needed (enough to break a spoke). Get a new cog! 

I wouldn't bother checking until you see a problem, like difficulty shifting onto the biggest or smallest ring/sprocket, or the opposite: shifting off it. When this happens, it is not a "show stopper" problem. You can probably complete your ride, or even just pull over and make the adjustment right there. There is usually a warning that the derailleur is going out of calibration. Before it becomes very difficult to shift to a gear, it first becomes slightly difficult and it progresses from there. Regarding point 3, perhaps you're missing the plastic guard ring which goes between the casette/freehub and the spokes. Which is not to say that this is what prevents slippage, but it does prevent contact between chain and spoke. By the way, one potential problem affecting the front derailleur, or at least some types, is that the entire assembly can rotate around the frame post to which it is clamped. The front and rear derailleurs interact. Notice how it is easier to shift onto the leftmost sprocket when you're on the leftmost ring. So it cannot be ruled out that some rear difficulty is actually connected to a front problem. One last piece of advice, and that is to install a rear derailleur protector, if you don't already have one. This part which installs on your wheel axle, held in place by the wheel lug nut. It extends a curved steel bar over the derailleur which guards it from being knocked around. 

If that stanchion tube is bent, then on top of the steering problems, the suspension isn't going to work. In this case, perhaps just that tube can be replaced instead of the whole fork? That's the optimistic view. The more pessimistic view is that it's bent in two places. Let's rotate it back along these two points to illustrate: 

If spraying a light oil onto the crankshaft temporarily relieves the problem, that suggests that it's the bottom bracket (a really poor name given to the crank bearings and shaft assembly to which the pedal cranks attach). The shaft, by the way, is also called a "spindle". The oil seeps along the spindle into the bottom bracket, and provides some temporary relief to bearings that are dried out and perhaps rusted out. The fact that the oil is able to seep in there shows that the bottom bracket seals have failed; what your penetrating oil is doing now, water and dirt have already been doing for some time. On most modern bicycles of reasonable quality, the bottom bracket is a single, sealed cartridge unit. Or rather, a cartridge that screws into the "bottom bracket shell" (the cylindrical space in the bicycle frame) from the drive side, and mates with second part that is screwed in from the left side and is opposite-threaded, which gives the bracket proper alignment and stability. Replacing the bottom bracket is a simple, common maintenance task. Bottom bracket cartridges range in price, and can be obtained for well under $100 USD. (Lightly googling, I see some for even less than $20 USD.) The important parameters of the bottom bracket are not only its thread diameter, obviously, but the length of the spindle: you want to match your old one closely.
