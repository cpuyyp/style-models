Whichever figure you use, it is clear that adding the China and USA captivity totals, you greatly exceed the global count of wild tigers, even before other countries' captivity figures are added. 

No. It is very hard to prove someone did not say something. The etymologist users at Wikiquote have declared this as misattributed. 

Summary:Yes, lizards drink water. The idea that they absorb water through their skin seems to have been over-turned. Some lizards drink water by lapping it into their mouths: 

Summary Peppermint tea (and related: peppermint oil and menthol) has been studied as a treatment for a wide-range of conditions, and shows some potential to help in a number of them. There are a number of hurdles that drugs must pass before they can be recommended for a particular condition - including safety and efficacy. Peppermint Tea hasn't passed those hurdles (with a minor exception that it is approved in Germany to treat indigestion). 2006 Review A 2006 paper reviewed the evidence that was current at the time. 

Kent Smith, a.k.a Flickr user kentsmith9 claims to be the original photographer of this image. He writes: 

He attributes that work to: Hendley JO, Wenzel RP, Gwaltney JM Jr. Transmission of rhinovirus colds by self-inoculation. N Engl J Med 1973; 288: 1361-4. I have been unable to confirm that this paper says this. Has anyone access? This patent for a Door Handle Cover cites J. Owen Hendley and Jack M. Gwaltney, Jr., Mechanisms of transmission of rhinovirus infections. Epidemiologic Reviews, Vol 10, 1988 The patent authors claim that the paper authors claim: 

Is it true that you can predict, to within a week, a prolonged period of particular baby fussiness, using this calendar? 

While it generally references a book I have never read, Crystal Power: The Ultimate Placebo Effect, it doesn't give a direct reference to support the claim there is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence. It is hard to prove the absence of scientific evidence, but one standard we use on Skeptics.SE is to find an expert in the area, who has done a search, and rely on that. It isn't perfect (Appeal to Authority), but it is the best we can hope for. In this case, in 2010, an article was written about oncology in particular: 

So the result is better than anecdotal-with-confirmation-bias, but still very limited in its power. I'd like to see someone find a more comprehensive answer. 

While this result is suggestive, I don't find it to be definitive, as the caucasians were tested at a different time in a different facility, making them a poor control. Also the sample sizes were small, in an area which may vary by age and other factors. 

In conclusion, there is no claim here to address - just a description of some wishful thinking. On the other hand, it could be seen as good news for all the people who have studied their respective parts of all of the physics, psychology and biology knowledge that we have assembled over the past few hundred years of painstaking experiments. They can breathe a sigh of relief. No need to throw it all out and start again over this particular web-site. I acknowledge I don't provide a lot of references here: My key reference is the original web-site itself. The Tetris Effect is just background for people who are skeptical about the validity of Freudian dream analysis; I could find published papers, but it seems overkill. I am looking for claim I make that needs more evidentiary support, but I can't see any. Have I missed anything? 

This demonstrates that the nutritional labelling does not rely on bomb calorimetry data without regard for the factors the question was concerned about. If a bomb calorimeter would give an unfair over-estimate, the manufacturer can use a more reasonable evaluation of the components. If even that is unreasonable, (I assume olestra would be an example,) they may request a ruling for a different technique. The paper gives examples of how the different techniques (plus UK labelling regulations) give different answers. It also explains how chromatographic techniques can be used to measure the different types of sugar levels of foods, such as honey. Ignoring the water content, wood would consist of largely insoluble dietary fiber (which the paper demonstrates can be defined physiological, chemically or gravimetrically, and that the guidelines stipulate the last definition.) The paper does point out there are some unanswered questions, such as whether all soluble dietary fibers, by the legal definition, have the same physiological effects. In conclusion, the textbooks were the ones over-simplifying the process. The nutrition scientists and the FDA realise it isn't a gold standard for calorific content. 

I love this question, because, until now, I never doubted lemon juice worked. I love this answer, because it surprised me even more than the question. Yes... and No! Lemon juice may make things better or worse. It depends on the avocado! Ascorbic acid works though. 

Ah, good old Zeljko Ranogajec. He has so secretive and has so many rumours of his super-human abilities flying about, he's like the Keyser SÃ¶ze of the gambling world! Keno has a growing jackpot, where a portion of the losses from previous players accumulate. The expected return (in the statistical sense of "expected") of a ticket depends on the size of the jackpot. Generally, the expected return is negative. If the jackpot is exceptionally large, which occurs rarely, it could actually turn out to have a positive expected return. In such rare cases, it may make sense to purchase a large number of tickets. It would take millions of dollars to bring the expected variance in the return down to a manageable level, but Ranogajec (allegedly!) spends that sort of money on bets regularly. I have heard other (plausible but unsubstantiable) rumours that Ranogajec gets substantial discounts from TABCorp in return for his business. (Casino Online claims it accounts for 6-8% of TABCorp's revenues.) [I heard discounts as high as 7%, this newspaper article suggests 4%.] This should be factored in when trying to work out the estimated return. 

So far, I have been unable to find any estimates that reach the 50-90% figure quoted. The Eighth report of the Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings (2010) explains the difficulty: 

Conclusion There does appear to be a relationship between humor and intelligence, but, perhaps unsurprisingly due to the slipperiness of the concepts, it depends on how and when you measure it. 

TL;DR: No, there is no lactase in raw milk. No, there are no probiotic organisms in raw milk that produce lactase. Some (named) lactase-producing microorganisms are added to yoghurt. 

The 2016, the population estimate of wild tigers was 3890 (an increase from 2010). Source: Scientific American Blog: 

In this study, the author looked at different mechanisms to reduce the browning of both plain avocado (in puree form), or a standardised batch of guacamole (which itself, contained lemon juice). Bates tried to use a photometer to precisely measure the browning, and describes the difficulties found. Bates started with a "Booth 8" avocado, from Florida. 

They rely on 24 different experimental studies. It is worth noting, that the relevant experiment studies (e.g. see page 11) tended to be surveys and studies measuring people's responses to plain packs. These is not as powerful as studies actually showing the effect in practice, but that has to wait until such legislature is implemented in some countries. They also examine the arguments put forward by tobacco companies, and cite studies that undermine or refute those arguments. 

Here is a quote from an article on the subject at The Linguist Library, talking about one such test: 

They Are Not The Same What I can say is "there is a difference". If the original claim was meant to imply they are nutritionally identical (as opposed to merely equally healthful), it is incorrect. 

There is a first-person account from 1976, from Dr. Fred A. Urquhart, part of a small team that found the wintering site of the Monarch butterflies after many years searching. 

The following argument is a "strong opinion, weakly held" - very weakly held. I am not offering it as a real answer, but instead as a deliberately provocative position to be attacked, in order to trigger some more robust answers than we have seen in skeptical publications. If we can't produce a more robust answer, perhaps it is time to question the theory. When a dowser claims that "The corpuscles ... that rise from the Minerals, entering the rod, determine it to bow down" [William Pryce, 1778] I smile at the invented explanation that has no explanatory or predictive power. When skeptics claim that dowsing is just the "ideomotor effect" [for example], I frown, because it sounds like just another invented explanation that has no explanatory or predictive power. I recently read a passage in a Tom Stafford BBC Future story about the (unrelated) Zeigarnik Effect explaining that the term: 

That doesn't mean that psychology hasn't found some scientific evidence to support some of the ideas in the meantime - and I would like to think they have, before they would be presented as true by a professor in a psych class. Rather than ask an open question like "Are Adler's theories true?" I have decided to pick one particular claim and ask about it. The Question Rashid claims that first born children (in a family of more than one child) are more likely as adults to purchase insurance. Is this true? (The given reasons provided are irrelevant if the claim is not true, but are based on the early experience of the loss of attention when the second child is born.) 

By itself, this claim (that the preschool sent such a letter) is barely notable, but it has been adopted as a rallying point by a number of anti-GMO web-sites. Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Is it, as claimed, policy in Federal Programs Preschools, that students are not permitted to bring their own lunch to school? (Bonus points: What is a Federal Programs Preschool?) 

In it, she takes a balanced view of the Jewish people, but identifies that they have suffered strong persecution, and calls for going to their support: 

The dramatic twist? The winner's wife was then investigated for voting twice, and the result was declared void. 

Here are three summaries of the evidence: A 2001 report from the British Psychological Society, The Nature of Hypnosis summarised: 

If this story had happened in the past five years, it is reasonable to expect the story would have made the local papers. The major daily in Dayton, Ohio is the Dayton Daily News. The searchable archive of the Dayton Daily News goes back at least five years. Searching the site for tattoo fitzgerald returns a number of unrelated results, but, crucially, demonstrates the archive search function works. Searching the site for [tattoo Brovent] reveals nothing ("Brovent" being the unusual surname of the woman involved.) Absence of evidence - where evidence is expected - is evidence of absence. I conclude this story did not occur in the last five years, with the names given, in the location given. Edited to Add: Via Snopes, the Daily Mail reports there are no corroborating court documents, while the Smoking Gun adds there are no people with those names in the Nexis database, and no registered tattoo artists by that name. 

This provided some fairly support for both Orac's statements about visiting doctors and also naturopaths and alternative practitioners:
