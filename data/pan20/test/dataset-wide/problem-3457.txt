We have two firms with identical cost structure compete in a market Demand function = $p=a-bq$ And $q=q_1+q_2$ They are identical in every way. However, firm 1 maximizes profit and firm 2 maximizes revenue as long as shareholders are satisfied, which he achieves by keeping profits nonnegative. Both firms have constant and equal marginal cost c. So I want to find the quantities that they will choose. ——— What I did is... For firm 1, $$\pi_1=max[(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_1-cq_1]$$ FOCs for $q_1$ $$a-2bq_1-bq_2-c=0$$ So $$q_1={a-bq_2-c\over 2b}$$ For firm 2, $$max [(a-b(q_1+q_2))q_2]$$ FOCs $$a-bq_1-2bq_2=0$$ $$q_2={a-bq_1\over 2b}$$ So, $$q_1={a-b({a-bq_1\over 2b})-c\over 2b}$$ $$q_1^*={a-2c\over 3b}$$ And $$q^*_2={5a+2b\over 6b}$$ —- The question says that “* firm 1 maximizes profit and firm 2 maximizes revenue as long as shareholders are satisfied, which he achieves by keeping profits nonnegative.*” Because of this sentence, I am exactly not sure about my solution. Especially for firm 2. I’m confused at this point. Please tell my mistakes. Thank you. 

You should seek for topics under Industrial Economics then. I have these books has reference (see below list). Keep in mind that Industrial Economics is highly focus on competition and market power. 

I believe your understanding of budget and GDP is a bit off. Comparing debt with GDP is more adequate, as GDP measures the country's production level, while budget is just an estimate. At least where I live, what is budgeted for the upcoming year is not always accomplished in the end, as there are gaps and things that missed the planning phase. In that case, it makes a bit more sense to compare what the country owes (debt) with what it is actually producing, rather than with what it estimates to produce, don't you think? I'm not exactly sure, but I believe GDP aggregates indirect revenues, while revenue size does not - hence looking more serious. 

There are two firs in the market. They produce perfect substitutes at cost $c(y_i)=y_i/3$ for i=1,2. The demand function is $p=1-(y_1+y_2)$ Consider the Cournot competition where firms simultaneously produce their respective outputs. However firm 1 has the opportunity to announce the output it will produce to firm 2 before the firms have produced any output. How can I find the equilibrium quantities? ———————— What I have done... For basic case, Cournot equilibrium For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-y_2-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1={2-3y_2\over 6}$$ For firm 2, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ So, $$y_1=(1/3)-(1/2)(2-3y_1/6)$$ $$y^*_1=2/9$$ $$y_2^*=2/9$$ For Stackelberg eqn in basic cases First firm is mover first $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ $$max[(1-y_1-({2-3y_1\over 6}))y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-(1/3)y_1-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1^*=1/5$$ $$y_2^*=7/30$$ I just find only Stackelberg equilibrium and Cournot equilibrium in basic cases. But I cannot find the part that I write above. How can I solve this part? Thank you. 

From the equation, if $L$ rises, everything else equals, then $u_n$ will rise (that is, the fraction will be smaller). $Y_n$ will also rise and that is a fairly reasonable conclusion - Extra work force will lead to more outputs. Now, the misleading conclusion is in regard to the markup. Consider now the labour market. When demand (work force) increases and all else remains equal (supply side - firms offering job opportunities), wages will lower and thus that setup will have a new equilibrium - with lower wages and more work force. This is my interpretation of your question, although the answer may not be 100% accurate, or an answer that actually answers your question. 

There are no identical business plans. You have to adequate yours to your idea. A quick example: When there is a physical product, you must include the design, explain it, whys and why not. When there is a service, for instance, perhaps it is better to explain why is it different than other solutions (you know, reinventing the wheel, not inventing it). I hope these will help you work something around. 

I solve this question in this way. But I am exactly not sure about my way. Please share your ideas with me. I will be happy if say something abou my solution. Thank you. 

Consider an oligopoly between two identical firms producing a homogenous good with constant marginal cost where firms face linear market demand. $B_i(q_j)$ denotes firm i’s best response given the output by firm j for i,j=1,2 and $i\not= j$. Let $q_c$ denote the Cournot equilibrium output choice where firms choose output simultaneously. Assume now a Stackelberg setup, where firm 2 observes firm 1’s choice before making its own output choice. Consider the following pair of strategies in the Stackelberg setup: firm 1 chooses $q_c$. Firm 2 chooses $q_c$ if firm 1 chooses $q_c$ otherwise firm 2 chooses $q^*_2 >>q_c$. (A) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a Nash equilibrium in the game. (B) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium in the game. 

There are many online. I don't recommend any of them, unless you're looking for a structure to guide you through. Business plans must suit the idea, and not otherwise. You can find generic templates out there, but I believe they should work as a guidelines - i.e., things you should include. But the point of a business plan is to explain everything about an idea/project and explore the outcomes from there. If you are able to explain every single detail of your idea, you'll find some weaknesses - which you must include, of course - and your exercise is now to think about how can you over come those weaknesses. Some questions for you to consider: 

I find them both easy to read and understand concepts, mainly the first one. When I first had to work with it, my common problem was with the math, but if your background is in Physics, I'm sure you'll have no problems understanding the functions transformations. Coursera also has some courses that slightly approach Industrial Economics, like this one, but I guess this will not suffice to you. 

What I did is Leaks inverse demand function $p=a-bq$ And $q=q_1+q_2$ And since marginal cost is constant c, then cost function is $cq_i$ First of all, I find Cournot equilibrium outputs $q_c$ I obtain by the profit maximization problem $$q_c=\frac{a-c}{3b}$$ for both firms. Secondly, since firm 2 also has a choice $q_2^* >> q_c$ Then let’s assume that $q_2^* = \frac{a-c}{2b}>>\frac{a-c}{3b}=q_c$ Then in order to obtain Stackelberg setup, by backward induction method Let’s calculate $q^*_1$ which is the firm 1’s quantity when firm 2 chooses $q_2^*=\frac{a-c}{2b}$. $$\pi_1=(a-bq_1-b(\frac{a-c}{2b}))q_1-cq_1$$ By FOC, $$q_1^*=\frac{a-c}{4b}$$ And $$q^*_1<< q_c$$ Thirdly I calculated profits for four cases Case 1: firm1’s quantity and firm 2’s quantity are both $q_c$ Then both firms’ profits are equal and equal to $\frac{(a-c)^2}{9b}$ Case 2: firm1’s quantity is $q_1^*$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_c$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{48b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{36b}$ Case 3: firm1’s quantity is $q_c$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_2^*$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{18b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{5(a-c)^2}{12b}$ Case 4: firm1’s quantity is $q_1^*$ firm 2’s quantity is $q_2^*$ Then, Firm 1’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{16b}$ Firm 2’s profit =$\frac{(a-c)^2}{8b}$ Now let’s look at the part (A) I construct the following table Table So as it is seen, only $(q_c, q_c)$ is Nash equilibrium. But $(q_1^*, q_2^*)$ is not Nash equilibrium. Next let’s look at the part (B) I construct tree in this case. Tree When we look at the table, First of all, it is for firm 2, In the left hand side, since the payoff of $q_c$ is greater than the payoff of $q_2^*$, the firm 2 will choose $q-c$. In the right hand side, since the payoff of $q_2^*$ is greater the payoff of $q_c$ for firm 2, then the firm 2 will choose $q^*_2$. Now, as for firm 1, if firm 1 choose $q_c$ then it knows that its payoff will be $(a-c)^2/9b$. But if firm 1 choose $q^*_1$ the its payoff will be $(a-c)^2/16b$. So the firm 1 will decide to choose $q_c$. That’s SPNE is $(q_c,q_cq_c)$. That is, $(q_1^*,q_2^*)$ is not SPNE.
