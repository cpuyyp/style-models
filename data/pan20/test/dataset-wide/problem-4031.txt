For locally compact groups this is an "if and only if". Claim 2: If $G$ is locally compact and $H<G$ is a closed subgroup containing $G^o$ then $G/H$ is td. We may identify $G/H$ with $(G/G^o)/(H/G^o)$ thus WLOG, $G=G/G^o$ and we get that $G$ is td locally compact and $H<G$ is a closed subgroup. In this case, by van Danzig theorem, for every $x\notin H$ we can find a compact open subgroup $K<G$ such that $Kx\cap H=\emptyset$, thus $\pi(K)$ is a compact open neighborhood of $eH$ not containing $xH$. 

Given $\pi:X\to Y$ as above, we may endow the space $\text{Prob}(Y)$ with the weak* topology and consider its closed subspace $Z=\cup_x \text{Prob}(\pi^{-1}(x))$ consisting of all probability measures which images in $X$ are delta measures. Identifying $\delta_x$ with $x$ we consider the map $\pi_*:Z\to X$. The disintegration of a probability measure $\mu\in\text{prob}(Y)$ is a $\pi_*(\mu)$-a.e defined measurable map $X\to Z$, $x\mapsto \mu_x$, as described in the question. One may ask whether such a map could be represented as a continuous map (and that was my initial interpenetration of the question above). The answer to this question is that in case $Y=X=[0,1]$ and $\pi:Y\to X$ is the Cantor-Lebesgue function (see $URL$ there are no local continuous sections $X\to Z$. Indeed, any such section is easily seen to be discontinuous at every diadic point of $X=[0,1]$. In particular, the disintegration function of any probability measure on $Y$ could not be represented by a continuous function. 

The following is an example of how torsion is used in the theory of 3-manifolds. It is a theorem of Thurston that there are infinitely many non isometric compact hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds of uniformly bounded volume (this is obvious in dimension 2 and false in higher dimensions). Probably the easiest way to see it is by constructing an infinite collection of compact hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds of uniformly bounded volume with pairwise different $H_1(\cdot,\mathbb{Z})$. Note that by a theorem of Gromov the betti numbers of a compact hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds are bounded by means of their volumes, hence the difference is really in the torsion part of the homology. The actual construction of the collection is as follows: fix a figure 8 knot in $S^3$, drill a tubular neighborhood of it (which is a fat torus) and glue it back using an arbitrary identification of the torus boundaries (of the fat torus and its complement). This process is known as "Dehn surgery". Computing the homology of the constructed manifold is easy using Mayer-Vietoris LES. The non-trivial parts in Thurston's proof are the facts that (for almost all gluing procedures) you get a hyperbolic manifold and its volume is indeed uniformly bounded. 

Claim 1: For any topological group $G$ and a subgroup $H$, if $G/H$ is totally disconnected (td) then $H<G$ is a closed subgroup containing $G^o$ , the identity connected component of $G$. Let me denote by $\pi:G\to G/H$ the map given by $\pi(g)=gH$. If $H$ is not closed then $\pi(\bar{H})$ is a connected set which is not a singleton. If $H$ does not contain $G^o$ then $\pi(G^o)$ is a connected set which is not a singleton. In both cases we get that $G/H$ is not td. 

The following is a commutative counter example. Fix a prime $p$, let $k=\mathbb{F}_p$ and let $R=k[x,y]/(x^2,y^2,xy)$. Let $m=(x,y)<R$. Then $R$ is a 3-dimensional $k$-vector space, $m$ a 2-dimensional subspace and every additive character on $R$ could be identified with a $k$-functional. Fix a character $\chi$ and view it as a functional. Fix an element $0\neq b_0\in m\cap \ker(\chi)$. Note that $\chi$ vanishes on $Rb_0=m\cap\ker(\chi)$. It follows that $|\{\chi(\cdot b)\mid b\in R\}|<|R|$. Since the dual group has $|R|$ elements, there exists some character $\phi$ such that there is no $b$ satisfying $\phi(\cdot)=\chi(\cdot b)$. 

I was wondering if there is a simple method to decompose $K_{2n}$ into one matching (1-factor) and $n-1$ hamiltonian cycles (connected 2-factors)? I tried to read some papers. The [Lucas 1892] paper was french! The [Alspach 2008] was printed in Bulletin of ICA, which does not have a digital version. And the [Bryant 2007] survey was too long and had a more general theorem about decomposition of $K_n$ or $K_n-I$ into m-cycles, depending on the relation of n and m. As you may know, decomposition of $K_{2n}$ into matchings (1-factor decomposition) and decomposition of $K_{2n+1}$ into hamiltonian cycles have very simple geometric-ish methods (form a regular polygon with a vertex inside and each turn consider edges parallel or perpendicular to some line). Have you heard of any simple method to decompose $K_{2n}-I$ ($K_{2n}$ minus a matching) into hamiltonian cycles? 

This proof is credited to Kamyar Khosravi. We can orient the edges of graph $G$ such that $d_G^-(v), d_G^+(v)\geq 2$ for each $v\in V(G)$ and any cycle of the given 2-factor $F$ will become directed cycles. (We just orient the cycles of the given 2-factor and then orient the remaining edges, using one (or some) eulerian circuit for $v+G\backslash E(F)$ which $v$ is a new vertex connected to odd vertices of G). Then we construct a bipartite graph $H$, each part $X$ and $Y$ having a copy of $V(G)$ and for any directed edge $e=uv$ in directed version of $G$ we add an edge from $u_X$ to $v_Y$. Each matching in H corresponds to a directed 2-factor in directed G. So by using edges of F, we can say H has a matching and satisfy Hall's condition. Then by an extended version of Hall's Theorem, we can say H has at least $\delta(X)!$ (if $\delta(X) < |X|$) which is $2!$ or simply $2$. So $G$ has at least two 2-factos. $\blacksquare$ For the case of $\delta(G)=3$ we can construct a counterexample graph with 18 vertices shown below. This graph has a cut edge $e=uv$, thus $e$ cannot be in any 2-factor. $u$ and $v$ must be in a triangle. We can then say other cycles of 2-factor are uniquely determined. 

We know that a k-factor of G is a k-regular spanning subgraph of G. And if G is 4-regular (or 2k-regular), it can be partitioned into 2 (k) edge-disjoint 2-factors (Petersen 1891). My question is in a graph G with $\delta \geq 4$ which already has a 2-factor, can we say it has another 2-factor (different in at least one edge, not distinct)? 

As @GordonRoyle said in comments, the statement is not true. In $K_n$ you have a star spanning tree with $n-1$ leaves and you have a path spanning tree with just 2 leaves. In fact most of the time two graph search algorithms DFS and BFS, give us two trees with different number of leaves. 

We have a graph G with maximum degree $\Delta$. The induced subgraph on vertices with degree equal to $\Delta$ is a bipartite graph (while the original graph is not). Prove that G has a matching that covers all vertices with degree $\Delta$. For example consider $K_{3,3}$ and add a vertex on one edge. So the graph has 7 vertices and 10 edges. The graph is not bipartite, but the induced subgraph on vertices with degree $\Delta(G) = 3$ is a bipartite subgraph. You can easily find a matching that covers all of the 6 vertices with degree 3. 

The answer is negative. Assume that $K_{0}$ and $K_{1}$ are two disjoint balls. If $K_{0}$ is at least twice as big as $K_{1}$, then $K_{0}$ should keep some nonzero distance in order to minimize his heat loss while $K_{1}$ should try to be as close as possible to $K_{0}$. To be more precise let $r_{0}$ and $r_{1}$denote the radii of the balls $K_{0}$ and $K_{1}$. Let \begin{align*} Q_{j}(d) = \int_{\partial K_{j}} \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} ds\quad \text{for} \quad j=0,1 \end{align*} denote the heat loss as a function of distance between the balls. Then $Q_{0}(d)$ is not monotonically increasing provided that $\frac{r_{0}}{r_{1}} > \ell$ where $\ell\approx 1.95$ is the positive solution of the equation \begin{align*} 2(1+x^{3})\left(\gamma+\psi\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right) \right)+x^{2}+x+2(x^{2}-x)\psi'\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)=0. \end{align*} In the above notation $\gamma$ is the Euler--Mascheroni constant, and $\psi$ is the digamma function. I have uploaded a preprint on arXiv about this problem. In the following figure the graph of $Q_{0}(d)$ is given when $r_{0}=20$, $r_{1}=1$, $0\leq d \leq 80$ and the temperature of the balls equals $1$. 

Let $r(t)$ be a real trigonometric polynomial of degree $n>1$. Assume it has zero at $t=0$ of multiplicity $k>0$. What can be said about the lower bound of the constant $c(k,n)$ such that $$ \max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}|r'| \geq c(k,n) \max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}|r|. $$ For example, 

Given $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ let $H_{\lambda}(x)$ be the solution of the Hermite differential equation: $$ \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} H_{\lambda}(x)-x\frac{d}{dx}H_{\lambda}(x)+\lambda H_{\lambda}(x)=0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R} $$ such that $H_{\lambda}(x) = x^{\lambda}+o(x^{\lambda})$ when $x \to +\infty$. If $\lambda=0,1,2,..$ is a positive integer then $H_{\lambda}$ is the probabilists' Hermite polynomial of degree $\lambda$. It is known that the Hermite polynomials do satisfy Tur√°n's inequality, i.e., $$ H_{\lambda}^{2}-H_{\lambda-1}H_{\lambda+1}\geq 0 \quad \text{for}\quad \lambda \in \mathbb{N} \quad \text{and} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\quad (*) $$ I suspect that (*) still holds for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. Does anybody know any references about this fact? I believe this should be something known. UPDATE The statement is true when $x \geq L_{\lambda}$ where $L_{\lambda}$ denotes the leftmost zero of $H_{\lambda}$. And it follows in the same way as in $URL$ page 392. The same recurrence relations hold and power growth at infinity makes the argument to work. Question is closed! 

I think this article might be helpful (see section 3, $URL$ also see this one ($URL$ Let me explain you very briefly what is happening there. Let us use the following notations: $g(x,y)=B(x,y)$ and $B$ satisfies $B_{11}B_{22}-B_{12}^{2}=0$. Take some suitable space curve $\gamma(t) = (f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t),f_{3}(t)) :I\to \mathbb{R}^{3}$ and lets require that $B(f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t))=f_{3}(t)$ (this is boundary condition for your function $B(x,y)$ --- this means that we are assuming that there is a domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{2}$ where the function $B$ is given and $B$ has prescribed boundary data on $\partial \Omega$. By the way, in this case $(f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t))$ parametrizes $\partial \Omega$ and $f_{3}$ is your boundary data for $B$). Then this already gives you one equation after differentiating $B(f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t))=f_{3}(t)$ in variable $t$: $$ B_{1}f'_{1}+B_{2}f'_{2}=f'_{3} $$ where $f'_{j}=\frac{df_{j}}{dt}$. This information is nothing unless you use the fact that $B$ satisfies homogeneous Monge--Ampere equation (i.e., the fact that it has zero Gaussian curvature). It means (thanks to Pogorelov) that you can draw some family of line segments close to the boundary $\Omega$ which start from the curve $(f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t))$ and go inside the $\Omega$. Moreover the function $B$ is linear along these segments and the gradient of $B$ is constant along these segments. The typical picture of these family of segments is given here (see the picture below)
