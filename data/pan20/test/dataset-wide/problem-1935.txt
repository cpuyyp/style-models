But I believe honesty, without details, is the best policy. They don't have to know, but if they push just say it from a pre-existing medical condition. Only jerks would push for more information. Though if funds are tight you could get some team members who ask management or HR about it. 

If you are in a position to comment on co-workers performance to the client, then they are not your co-worker. That means you are their supervisor/manager. The second issue is: if the need to have this level of conversation with the client is a significant portion of your day, then the office needs to be rearranged to allow you to have those chats in private. If your employee can see the chats, then you need a better arrangement. 

Before putting it on a resume or application you have to ask yourself the question "will it be recognizable to a recruiter or hiring manager?". In the US the Intel Science Talent Search is an example of a scholarship that should be listed. If you find yourself having to write an entire paragraph to explain what the scholarship is for, then it might be a sign it isn't significant. If hundreds earn it every year, it isn't prestigious enough. Yes, as time goes on the prominence of the award should decrease on your resume because it relevance to being able to do the job is less important. The qualities that went into earning the scholarship: hard work, dedication, perseverance, are still important; but they don't help the hiring manager know that you still have those qualities. 

When generating a CV/Resume assume it is never in the format you want. Some companies will convert to the file format they want. Others will automatically pull the info they find into a database. Many will ask you to cut and paste the paragraphs into their web form, one text box at a time. Make sure that the required info makes it through these processes. A URL that is so ugly and long that you want to hide behind anchor text, may limit the number of people who will be willing to type it out when they are only given an image of the resume. There is no need to make links to the companies you have worked for. Also few will click on github or other sites that will store your portfolio, unles they have specifically asked for those links. A new problem I have run into is that my corporate email is now configured to mangle all external URLs so that they can't be clicked, and that you have to carefully cut the good part so that you can paste it into the browser. 

In normal conditions even if you are the perfect candidate for the perfect job, and the potential company loves you; It can take weeks or months to start in the new position. Some companies interview, and then give a conditional offer that will only be exercised if they win the contract. The delay can be weeks, or months or even longer Some jobs require a background investigation that can take days to months. Some jobs require that the customer approve all new hires. I wouldn't say lie to a potential employer, especially if they have to start a lengthy and expensive background investigation. You may need to decide in a few months to start looking. You need to expect it to take at least two months. Though you might not be as picky if you view the job as a stop gap measure so you can continue to eat while working on version 2 of the product. This could speed up the search process. If you tell them that you are unlikely to accept the job, they are unlikely to even consider you for the job. In reality the odds that you will accept the job include not just how cool it sounds, how well it fits your skills, and the pay, but also the income your are earning from the personal project. 

Management needs to make it part of the goals for the group. They need to make it part of their expected performance. That means that the hours will be covered and all the costs. That means that management will not ask them to work unscheduled overtime, or on a weekend to makeup for the lost hours. I have seen companies only partially cover the costs, and then wonder why nobody wanted to go. Management has to negotiate the exact events, so that the non-work issues can be addressed. The employee may have taken the position specifically because expected travel was 0%. Employees also want to see a connection to their current tasks, or a task they will be starting within a few weeks of the training. Employees with enough years of experience have memories of training classes they never used, or were so shallow they could have learned everything by skimming through a 10 page pdf. Not all training is created equal. The amount of learning is not related to the amount of cool swag gathered at a conference. 

I have seen great variations within a single company regarding how they go through the steps of the hiring process. When I trying to fill a position I have experienced HR support that updated us everyday with new qualified resumes/applications. I have also applied for an internal transfer in that same company that only posted the opening for three days, but then took 3 months to move my application to the next phase. You may have applied to the slow part of the vaunted company Now in the weeks since the interview, unless this was not part of a systematic job search, you should have continued to apply and interview. Just continue down that path, there is no reason to wait for company x to respond before you contact other companies. Job searches are not done in neat phases, they involve juggling many opportunities, and many possible paths to a new position. 

If the new report will end up costing the company money, by increasing their payments to employees, you will have to convince management that they have to make the changes because they are legally obligated to, or morally obligated to make the changes. What is the long term impact if the change is never made? In the US there can be big penalties if the company purposefully underpays their employees. These tend to be issues related to overtime, but I an not a labor law expert. The manager may be ignoring your fixes because he doesn't feel it is his place to make the changes. His manager may be stopping the change. I would make one more attempt, then document the conversation and move on. Unless you are one of the victims, then you may have to get HR involved. 

If you try to avoid naming the student organization, the obvious question will be on every bodies mind. It may occur to the interviewers that they might not want to know the answer, but for most companies it doesn't make a difference. Once you provide the name of the organization they will move on to the detail of what kills you have not what rallies you organized. In a large organization it can be guaranteed that people all across the political spectrum work for the company. On a college campus the same is true. Some people join a club because they want to be active in something; others want to meet girls; some actually care passionately about the cause. Once they join their activity level is guided by others circumstances. Your choice of political viewpoint, unless it is the most extreme and hardcore, means little to me because in about half the case I was never going to end up working with you. Interviews are performed by people because the represent HR, the technical skills, or have a hole in their schedule that day. Yes some are on the team that has the job opportunity, but not always. There is one note you should remember. Just like cover letters, a resume can be tailored to the company. If you want to demonstrate that your didn't sit in the dorm for 4 years, you stress some things. If you want to show you could be passionate about a single topic for a sustained period, stress other things. And if naming this student organization would eliminate you from consideration then maybe the company is too political for you. 

You need a job. There are many ways to find a job. One way is to use your professional and social networks to help you find a job. If they don't know you need a job they wont know to make suggestions. Yes you need to start applying, and searching, but those networks you have established can help you. Some of the professional contacts you have may be the key to opening the door in their company. It also may come from social contacts. Your professional web site may also play a role in potential employers evaluating you, so you need to make sure that the social only contacts know about your website. As part of the job search you should also spend time trying to expand your networks. 

A small company can be compared to a small project. For some companies/projects having one employee with skill set X is fine, for others it is not. It will depend on the product being produced by the company/project. Is function X critical to the survival of the company/project? If yes then you want to avoid a low bus number. If it is not critical then it might be able to survive while you find a replacement. It will also depend on the workload needed to complete the tasks. They can't just have two of everything just in case of disaster, or to provide way for an employee to grow. 

I would contact them again this week, but wouldn't hold my breath. Nor would I stop applying and interviewing for other positions. 

The simple answer is that you should charge for meetings. You can't do your job without some meetings. These could be in person, or by phone/Skype... The longer answer is to check your contract. Sometimes the contract specifically mentions meetings you must support/attend. The contract could also specify if you can charge for travel time and expense (subway fare, tolls...). There is also the chance that the contract doesn't allow you to charge for some meetings, but those should be specified in the contract. They may only allow you to charge at meetings they specifically ask you to attend. 

First of all you use the phrase "My recruiter submitted me for Job A with a company I really like and this job paid X amount of dollars" but according to your comment the recruiter worked for the employer. Their job was to find somebody to fill certain positions at a price that makes the company a profit. The recruiter may have tried to sneak you into another position. The company already had evaluated your skills and background, and may have realized that they would not make the profit they needed in position A. What you don't know is was this a decision by the recruiter to try and salvage time already invested in your evaluation? was this a shot in the dark to see if you would accept lower pay? or was this a decision by the company management and the recruiter was just playing their role. If you believe the recruiter was at fault, it might be possible to negotiate a higher pay. Though if they have other potential candidates they may just go with another choice. Pushing the case may get the recruiter in trouble, but they could still reject you and fire the recruiter. I would chalk it up to a lesson learned and move on.
