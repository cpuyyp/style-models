For $\deg P = 1$ or $2$, yes. For $\deg P=1$, take $$P(x) = Mx+a,\ Q(x) = b,\ D(x) = \frac{M^2}{b^2} x^2 + \frac{2 Ma}{b^2} x + n.$$ For $M$ a sufficiently divisible integer, this will have integer coefficients. For $\deg P=2$, take $$P(x) = (a+1) (Mx+1)^2 - 1,\ Q(x) = (Mx+1) b,\ D(x) = \frac{M^2(a+1)^2}{b^2}x^2+ \frac{2 M (a+1)^2}{b^2}x + n.$$ For sufficiently divisible $M$, this will have integer coefficients. 

Sure. Find $T_i$ between $F$ and $F_i$ such that $T_i/F$ is pure transcendental and $F_i/T_i$ is purely algebraic. Let $T_i = F(S_i)$, with the $S_i$ algebraically independent. Without loss of generality, suppose that the cardinality of $S_1$ is less than or equal to that of $S_2$. Then the algebraic closure of $F(S_2)$ is a suitable $L$. 

There are moduli spaces of tropical lifts. They satisfy "Murphy's law": Any behavior which can happen on a scheme of finite type can happen on them. See Katz and Payne "Realization spaces for tropical fans" for the details. 

I'll describe a number of $n^2+n$ dimensional subvarieties. I have not yet found a point which isn't on one of them (in particular, they subsume all of your $2n$ dimensional families). If we are very optimistic, perhaps this is your intersection. Before starting, it seems nicer to change signs, so the equations are $W+X+Y+Z=0$ and $W^{-1}+X^{-1}+Y^{-1}+Z^{-1}=0$. Let $n=d_1+d_2+d_3$. Choose any decomposition of $\mathbb{C}^n$ as $V_1 \oplus V_2 \oplus V_3$ with $\dim V_i = d_i$; the space of ways to do this is $n^2-d_1^2-d_2^2-d_3^2$ dimensional. Then take our quadratic forms $(W,X,Y,Z)$ so that $V_1$, $V_2$ and $V_3$ are mutually orthogonal, with $W+X=Y+Z=0$ on $V_1$, $W+Y=X+Z=0$ on $V_2$ and $W+Z=X+Y=0$ on $V_3$. This adds $(d_1^2+d_1)+(d_2^2+d_2)+(d_3^2+d_3)$ dimensions, so $n^2+n$ in all. 

A quick google turns up: Undirected simple connected graphs with minimum number of spanning trees by Zbigniew R. Bogdanowicz. According to this paper, the optimal graph is built as follows: Start with the complete graph $K_{n-k}$. Take $k-1$ additional vertices and join them each to the complete graph by a single edge each. Finally, take one more vertex and join it to $m - \left( \binom{n-k}{2} + k-1 \right)$ of the vertices in the complete graph. (So we get $m$ edges total.) One should choose the parameter $k$ to be as small as possible, compatible with the requirement that $m - \left( \binom{n-k}{2} + k-1 \right)$ must be nonnegative. I couldn't find any references on the $2$-connected version of this. 

I've never seriously attempted a computation like this, so don't take this answer too seriously. I'm curious where this problem comes from for you; I don't often encounter matrix groups given by defining equations. The only example I can think of is where one specifies some homogeneous polynomials and asks for the subgroup of $GL_n$ preserving them. That said, I would start out by computing the Lie algebra of $G$. This is easy to do from defining equations. The Lie algebra of $GL_n$ is spanned by $\partial/\partial x_{ij}$ for $1 \leq i,\ j \leq n$. If $f_1$, $f_2$, ...., $f_r$ are generators for the ideal of $G$ then the Lie algebra of $G$ is the set of those vectors $\sum c_{ij} \partial/\partial x_{ij}$ such that $\sum c_{ij} (\partial f_k/\partial x_{ij})|_{\mathrm{Id}}$ is zero for $k=1$, ..., $r$. (You don't need a Grobner basis for this; any generating set works.) So, if you have $r$ defining equations, you can get the Lie algebra by solving $r$ linear equations in $n^2$ variables. Why would I do this? Well, if the Lie algebra is $0$-dimensional, you win! The connected component of the identity is a point. More generally, if you recognize the Lie algebra as some classical Lie algebra you are familiar with (for example, if it's abelian) that might help you find equations. 

The Hall algebra of finite abelian $p$-groups, "at $p=1$". Wikipedia explains the basics here, lecture 2 of Schiffmann's lectures on Hall algebras has more. A more high-tech way to thinking of setting $p=1$ is to consider the Hall algebra of nilpotent $\mathbb{C}[t]$ modules (nilpotent meaning that $t$ acts nilpotently), where, instead of counting subgroups, you take the Euler characteristic of the space of subgroups. UPDATE: I have realized that I don't understand this as well as I thought. I know that the symmetric functions are lurking here, but I don't quite understand how. You are probably better reading Schiffmann than trusting me for details. 

It is interesting that the dimension is $8$, as the naive guess would be $9$. ($4$ dimensions to choose a point on $\mathbb{P}^4$, another $4$ to choose another point, and $1$ dimension to choose a point on the line between them.) The fact that we fall short means that those points which are on secant lines are on a positive dimensional family of secant lines. Let's see why this is true. As mentioned above, a generic point of $Y$ is some rank $2$ matrix. (There are also rank $1$ matrices, but those lie in a closed subvariety.) Without loss of generality, let's look at the matrix $$X:=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ Look at the $\mathbb{P}^2$ of matrices of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ b & c & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$ Inside this $\mathbb{P}^2$ is a conic of rank one matrices, given by the equation $ac=b^2$. For any point $(a:b:c)$ on this conic, the line through $(a:b:c)$ and $(1:0:1)$ meets the conic a second time. The line joining these two rank one matrices is a secant passing through $X$. So we see that any rank $2$ matrix lies on a positive dimensional pencil of secants. This computation rules out some approaches to solving the problem. One idea I had was to consider the incidence variety $\mathcal{S}$ consisting of $(A,B, z)$ of triples where $A$ and $B$ are rank $1$ matrices and $z$ is a point on the line $\overline{AB}$. (There would be some issues when $A=B$, but let's ignore that for now.) So $\mathcal{S}$ has dimension $9$ and projection to $z$ gives a map $\mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{P}^{14}$ with image $Y$. If $Y$ were also $9$-dimensional, I could hope to do some computations in $H^{\ast}(\mathcal{S})$ and determine the pushforward of the fundamental class of $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathbb{P}^{14}$. This would be the desired degree. But, since $\dim Y$ is $8$, this pushforward would just be zero. 

If $\ell$ is an odd prime, $K \supset \mathbb{Q}(\mu_{\ell})$ and $Gal(K/\mathbb{Q}) \cong GL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$, then I claim that we can choose the isomorphism to have cyclotomic determinant. In other words, we can arrange that the diagram $$\begin{matrix} Gal(K/\mathbb{Q}) &\cong& GL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell}) \\ \downarrow && \downarrow \det \\ Gal(\mathbb{Q}(\mu_{\ell}) & \cong & \mathbb{F}_{\ell}^{\times} \\ \end{matrix}$$ commutes, where the left down arrow is the standard Galois theory map and the bottom isomorphism is the standard one. Proof: Note that $$\begin{pmatrix} 1&0 \\0&-1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1&-1 \\0&1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1&0 \\0&-1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1&1 \\0&1 \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix} 1&2 \\0&1 \end{pmatrix}$$ is a commutator. Since $\ell$ is odd, this means that its $(\ell+1)/2$-th power, namely $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1&1 \\ 0 &1 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ is in the commutator subgroup, as is $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1&0 \\ 1 &1 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$. These generate $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$, so the commutator subgroup is $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$. Thus, any character $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell}) \to \mathbb{F}_{\ell}^{\times}$ must be some power of the cyclotomic character $\chi$. Chase around the diagram left-down-right to map $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell}) \to \mathbb{F}_{\ell}^{\times}$; let the result be $\chi^k$. Since this map is surjective, $k$ is a unit modulo $\ell-1$; let $j$ be its inverse. Note that $2|\ell-1$ so $j$ is odd, say $j=2r+1$. Modify the top isomorphism by the automorphism $g \mapsto (\det g)^r g$ of $GL_2(\mathbb{F}_{\ell})$, and now the diagram commutes. 

John McCarthy points out that the definition of $*$ seems to vary across textbooks. Looking at the $3$ books I have available: Voisin (Section 5.1) defines $*$ to be a $\mathbb{C}$-linear map, which takes $(p,q)$-forms to $(n-q, n-p)$ forms, and for which $\overline{\partial}^* = - * \partial *$. This is the convention I have been following. Wells (Secton V.2) defines $*$ in the same way as Voisin, but then also defines $\overline{*}$ by $\overline{*} \phi = * \overline{\phi}$, and basically doesn't mention $*$ again. He writes $\overline{\partial}^* = - \overline{*} \overline{\partial} \overline{*}$. This defines the same map as Voisin does, but generalizes more nicely to vector bundles. This is a nice expository choice; I probably would have done better to follow this in my course. Griffiths and Harris (Section 0.6) define $*$ to be a $\mathbb{C}$-antilinear map which takes $(p,q)$-forms to $(n-p, n-q)$ forms. (See a little earlier on p. 82.) This suggests that their $*$ is Wells' $\overline{*}$. I am not sure that they are exactly the same, though. Looking at $\mathbb{C}$, with the standard Kahler form, I think Wells' $\overline{*} (dz)$ should be his $* d\overline{z}$ which I think is $dy + i dx = i d \overline{z}$. That is off by $i$ from Griffiths and Harris' formula, I'm not sure why. In any case, it appears that G and H write $*$ for a map which has the complex conjugate built in, where the others do not. They all seem to agree as to what $\overline{\partial}^*$ means. 

$\def\PP{\mathbb{P}}$Let $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_n$ be points in $\PP^{k-1}$. I am interested in equations for when the $z_i$ lie on a rational normal curve (or degeneration thereof.) Specifically, let $s: \PP^{k-1} \to \PP^{\binom{k+1}{2} - 1}$ be the $2$-uple Veronese. If the $z_i$ lie on a rational normal curve, then the $n \times \binom{k+1}{2}$ matrix $(s(z_1), s(z_2), \ldots, s(z_n))$ has rank $2k-1$. Let $X$ be the subscheme of $(\PP^{k-1})^n$ where $\mathrm{rank}(s(z_1), s(z_2), \ldots, s(z_n)) \leq 2k-1$. Let $V$ be the subscheme of $(\PP^{k-1})^n$ obtained by taking the closure of those points that lie on a degree $k-1$ rational curve. So $V \subset X$. If $k \leq 2$, this is trivial. If $k=3$, this says that $n$ points lie on a conic if and only if the $6 \times n$ matrix $(s(z_1), s(z_2), \ldots, s(z_n))$ has a right kernel -- again, this is obvious. So the first hard situation is $k=4$. I would love it if $V=X$. That seems too good to be true, once $k \geq 4$, although I don't actually have a counter-example. Here are weaker things that would make me happy: 

So, suppose that $S$ is a set which does not contain any division, and let $T$ be disjoint from $S$, but contain an element representing every division class in $S$. If we have a Euclidean proof, it will construct some prime $p$. We may know that $p$ is not in various subgroups of $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^*$, or that $p$ is in some union of $D(f, \lambda, N)$'s. But that information can't distinguish whether $p$ is in $S$ or in $T$, so our proof can't show that $p$ is in $S$. OK, my last boxed claim is a precise statement. Let's prove it. It is easy to see that a subgroup of $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^*$ is a union of divisions (since we are in an abelian group, the conjugacy part of the definition is irrelevant). The complement of a subgroup is likewise such a union. The interesting thing is $D(f, \lambda, N)$. Let $K$ be a Galois field where $f$ and $x^N-1$ both split. Let $G$ be the corresponding Galois group, so $G$ comes equipped with a map to $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^* \cong \mathrm{Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N)/\mathbb{Q})$. Now, as you probably know, for $p$ a prime unramified in $K$, the factorization of $f$ modulo $p$ is determined by the Frobenius conjugacy class of $p$ in $G$. What you may or may not know is that it is actually determined by the division class of $p$! (For example, $x^5-1$ has the same factorization modulo primes which are $2 \mod 5$ and primes which are $3 \mod 5$.) To see this, just look at the recipe for reading the factorization off from the Frobenius class. It may or may not help to prove the following lemma: If $g \sim h$, and $X$ is a set with a $G$ action, then there is an order preserving bijection between the $g$ and the $h$ orbits in $X$. So, the possible Frobenius classes in $G$ of primes in $D(f, \lambda)$ are unions of divisions (I am implicitly using the Cebotarov density theorem here). But then $D(f, \lambda, N)$ is just the projection to $(\mathbb{Z}/N)^*$ of the possible Frobenius classes in $G$ of primes in $D(f, \lambda)$. Since maps of groups take divisions to divisions, this shows that $D(f, \lambda, N)$ is a union of divisions. Frobenius's density Theorem states that there are infinitely many primes with Frobenius in every division. (And, more precisely, that their Dirichlet density is the size of the division divided by the order of $G$.) It is significantly easier than Cebatarov's, using only the material from a first course in algebraic number theory and a first course in analytic number theory. Cebatarov's density theorem is the "union" of Frobenius's and Dirichlet's theorems. What I am suggesting is that Euclidean methods, at best, can only get at their intersection. I am not sure whether or not I think Euclidean proofs can get that far. If you think they can, give me a Euclidean proof that there are infinitely many primes which are in $\{ 3, 5 \}$ mod $7$. I can show infinitely many in $\{ 3,5,6 \}$, and infinitely many in $\{ 2,3,4,5 \}$, but I can't get the intersection. 

You might find this book helpful, if you want to get into the details. Disclaimer: I found it while googling for something else and figured I'd mention it. I haven't read it myself. 

Yes. Since det(P)=1 and tr(P)=0, the eigenvalues of P are \pm i. So one of the logarithms of P is p, a matrix in su(2) with eigenvalues i \pi/2 and - i \pi/2. Here su(2) is the Lie algebra of SU(2). (In terms of quaternions, p is of the form bi+cj+dk with b^2+c^2+d^2=(pi/2)^2.) Similarly, Q has a logarithm q in su(2) which also has eigenvalues \pm i pi/2. Let H be the plane in su(2) spanned by p and q. Now, SU(2) acts on su(2) by the group SO(3) of orthogonal rotations. Let G be the rotation of H by angle pi. So G p G^{-1}=-p and G q G^{-1} = -q. Exponentiating these equations, G has the desired property. 

To answer the actual question, I don't know any standard symbol; I've seen $P$, $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathtt{PRIMES}$. (The last seems more common in the CS-literature, such as this famous paper.) I would like to use this as an opportunity to make my standard plea for using multi-letter symbols; and to argue in this case for $\mathtt{PRIMES}$. There are more important concepts than can be represented by upper and lower case letters, even allowing multiple fonts and Greek letters. Moreover, multi-letter symbols are far more self-explanatory than single character ones; I can open up a paper, see $\mathtt{PRIMES}$ in the middle of a page and have a very good guess what it represents; not so with $\mathbb{P}$. Moreover, if you tie down the simple one letter symbols for major objects, you'll won't have them available for little dummy roles like the $p$ and $s$ in your formula. For example, suppose you needed the partial product $$\prod_{\substack{ p \in \mathtt{PRIMES}\\ p < P }} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$$ and needed to work with expressions like $O(\min(P^{-1} \log P, 10))$ for how things depended on your bound. (Open up pretty much any analytic number theory paper to see examples like this.) Wouldn't you be glad you hadn't wasted $P$ on a set, which is unlikely to appear in any complicated algebraic manipulations? PS: Of course, in many cases, spelling things out in words is the best solution. There is certainly nothing wrong with "$\prod_p \ \left( \textrm{such-and-such} \right)$, where $p$ runs through the primes".
