These are goals that are somewhat in conflict with each other; however, the basic answer to your question has to do with rest. In order to build bigger and/or stronger muscles, you need to manage both the stress that causes change to happen and the rest that allows the change to happen. Lifting weights is the stress that tells your body that it needs to adapt (get bigger, get stronger, etc.). Rest is just as important. It's during periods of rest that your body is able to hypercompensate and build up the muscle. (Practical Programming for Strength Training, Dr. Kilgore and Mark Rippetoe) With that basic understanding, it is best to do both your heavy conditioning work and your weight lifting work on the same day. The only time you may consider changing that is very low impact active recovery work. Essentially if you walked your 10k (heart rate in the active recovery zone) on the in-between day, it would help you deplete the lactic acid buildup from your heavy work day. It wouldn't build any speed, but it helps your body recover. It's always important to order the exercises in your program in order of importance. In short if the conditioning for running is more important than your strength, the order of work should reflect that. Now, why I said your goals are somewhat in conflict with each other is due to the metabolic pathways needed for the different type of work. Long distance running requires a more aerobic (or mildly anaerobic) metabolic conditioning, whereas weightlifting is primarily anaerobic. Your body will make the best choices it can to balance the demands you are putting on it, but you will not be a great runner or a great lifter. At some point in the future (and it may be years) you will hit a wall and will have to choose which you want to specialize in. 

Although it is in different language (may use google translate) in the link here there is a movie about training (pulling 92 lbs bow 57 Times) and pictures of different drills on bow training. You may also try Korean Method for archery training. (read the comments in the page. It can be helpful) I hope all these helps. 

Most of the migranes are hereditary. Biological states may cause increases in free fatty acids and blood lipids, increased platelet aggregation, decreased serotonin levels and increased prostaglandin levels, which can cause the vasodilatation that precedes migraine headache. One possible reason for this is that a part of the physical reaction may be the elevation of blood pressure (important). The other possible reason can be the physical exertion of the body during exercise, and sudden drop of blood sugar which is the trigger for your exercise-induced headaches. What can you do? drink water and get well hydrated, have good warm-up before exercise, begin slowly then increase your intensity, choose less forceful or lower-impact exercises (by the way, weightlifting seems to be more likely to cause migraines, you may try some preventative medication before exercising, decrease the intensity of the exercise slowly. There are some studies about it Prevention of Exercise Induced Migraine by Quantitative Warm-up The effects of exercise and exercise-related changes in blood nitric oxide level on migraine headache On the good site, Nitric Oxide which is released during exercise may help to relieve the pain (more info: pls, read the article above) 

Lets say you put in 1000 lbs volume of training stress. No matter how you split up the components of weight, reps, and sets, as long as the total volume doesn't change your body is used to that level of work. That doesn't mean you'll be able to bench press 1000 lbs if you can do 40 lbs for 5 sets of 5 reps. You will need to increase the volume of work over time. Even adding one rep per session is increasing the overall volume a little bit. Let's say you take that 40 lbs and increase the reps per set to 10 over time. When you suddenly reduce the volume of work back down to 60lbs 5x5, your body is still used to compensating for the 5x10. So you get stronger. Add, rinse, and repeat. The specific rep ranges and number of sets you do depend on your current specific goals. Are you trying to add muscle mass? More sets in the range of 8-12 reps is in order. Are you trying to get stronger, varying the rep ranges is very helpful. 

I want to predict 1RM using a formula but I am not sure which is the best to use for the male athletes ages rages from 18 to 30 years old. For example, if I can bench press 80kg 4 times what could my 1RM be? 

Do not worry about your lungs, they are completely normal. Punctured lungs is a very different clinical condition that needs to be operated. Clue: When you do the twist do not let the motion make the air out of your lungs, you need to contract the side you twisted toward and you squeeze the air out in your control. You will get more benefit by doing this. 

The negative effect on VO2max due to detraining varies a bit with different studies, with losses ranging from 4-14% when training is stopped for less than 4 weeks [1-8]. Obviously, the longer the inactivity, the more the negative impact on VO2max., to a point. For example one study found that endurance athletes lost 7% of their VO2max in the first 21 days of inactivity and eventually stabilized at a 16% loss after 56 days (1). A different study found that over a 2400 meter run, women averaged 21 seconds slower following 15 days of inactivity. [18] The better trained you were before the inactivity (higher trained-state VO2max), the bigger its decline when training is stopped (1). You can find the references in the following link Link 

Currently I'm running 12 400m repeats on a track, with 3 minutes for each repeat: so roughly a minute and a half of recovery between each lap. What constitutes 'good' quality for these intervals? eg should I be aiming to hit exactly the same lap time throughout the session, or would that mean that I was going out too easy for the first few? should I be doing less repeats? Increasing the recovery time between them? (Currently I'm doing the first 4 in about 1:22, the next four at about 1:30, and the remainder fluctuating between 1:25 and 1:35) 

I usually run for an hour in hot weather every Saturday (I'm in the tropics, so it's usually 30 degrees or above, with around 90% humidity). I weigh myself before and afterwards, and usually I'll lose about a kilo in weight in that time - which I assume is mostly water - I sweat like a pig. (Currently I'll drink about 600 ml of water while running, plus another 400 ml when I'm done, so I guess I'm actually losing about 2 kilos through dehydration during that hour. I weigh about 75 kg, so that's roughly 2.5% of my body weight that I've lost in that time.) The people I run with don't drink anything while running. They're possibly better habituated to the environment than I am (mostly locals, while I've only been out here for a couple of years) - what could I do to reduce my fluid intake while I'm running? 

And the list goes on. Since you aren't trying to lose weight, you probably won't have to do too much to your diet. Now it's just about getting active. 

There is very likely something going on with your technique. Without more information for your specific problem, all I can do is provide a list of things to look at. 

Cardiovascular fitness is easy to lose, but also very easy to reacquire. Strength is slower to lose, but 4-5 weeks won't see any significant differences. However, the bigger concern is the health of your tendons and ligaments. Ramping up allows them to get re-acclimated to work and less prone to developing tendinitis or something of that nature. 

Unless you are a big guy trying to lose weight, hitting your dietary protein requirements without breaking your calorie limits for the day is quite easy to do with real food. Protein shakes come to play when you need to increase your protein while still trying to stay below a Calorie limit. That said, there are four things your muscles need to grow and get stronger: 

There is a myth that exercise increases the secretion of testosterone. In fact, short duration intense exercise increase testosterone level in the blood while long duration endurance type of exercises decrease. Yet, there is no extra testicular secretion of testosterone. What happens is that the rate of clearance of this hormone from the plasma decrease. Because the liver is a major site for the clearance of testosterone and liver blood flow decreases during exercise. The other reason of increased testosterone could be accounted for by haemo-concentration. That is, during short duration intense exercise you have increased level of testosterone in your blood but it is not due to the testicular secretion of it. 

In the literature there are some contradictory findings about the food intake after exercise. What is the effective time to start eating after exercise and how many hours later the effectiveness decrease for recovery? 

Eventually your squats will look like this: $URL$ The happy ending to the rehab work that this guy did is that the knee soreness is gone and he's lifting heavier than before. I recommend fixing the form issue before going any further. 

The Starting Strength program is very simple, and easy to follow. You will gain a lot of strength, which will have an effect on your muscle mass and weight goals. Combine that with a month or two of GOMAD and you are right on target. Once you hit intermediate levels, you can start specializing in physique or continue with strength. I find the easy to measure and concrete goals of strength training to be more to my liking. 

In fact to really hit the chest muscles well, dumbbells work best because you need to activate the chest to keep the dumbbells over you. Incline bench can also be a good compromise between overhead and bench press.
