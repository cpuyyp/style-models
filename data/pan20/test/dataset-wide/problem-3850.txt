Ultimately, I would like, under $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, to have some generic absoluteness about statements involving $A$ (as defined as $p[T]$). This statement also resemble results that are proved in choice setting assuming large cardinals. 

Suppose $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R} + V = L(\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{R})) + \mathsf{DC}$ holds. (We can use more if it is helpful.) I believe under $\mathsf{AD}_\mathbb{R}$, every $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is homogeneous Suslin. Let $T$ be some tree so that $A = p[T]$. Suppose $\mathbb{P}$ is a small forcing in $V_{\omega + \omega}$. (I am most interested by forcing whose conditions are reals like Sacks forcing, Cohen forcing, or Random forcing.) Let $G \subseteq \mathbb{P}$ be $\mathbb{P}$-generic for $V$. Let $A_G = p[T]^{V[G]}$. The question is Is there an elementary embedding $j : L(A,\mathbb{R}) \rightarrow L(A_G,\mathbb{R}^{V[G]})$? 

Suppose $\mathbb{P}$ is a definable proper forcing (for instance Sacks forcing). Let $\alpha$ be some ordinal. Let $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$ be the countable support iteration of $\mathbb{P}$ of length $\alpha$. It is well known that $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$ is also proper. Hence for any countable elementary structure $M \prec H_\Theta$ for sufficiently large $\Theta$ such that $\mathbb{P}_\alpha \in M$ and any $p \in \mathbb{P}_\alpha \cap M$, there exists some $q \leq_{\mathbb{P}_\alpha} p$ which is a $(M, \mathbb{P}_\alpha)$-generic condition. Let $X = \alpha \cap M$. The question is whether a $(M, \mathbb{P}_\alpha)$ generic condition $q \leq_{\mathbb{P}_\alpha} p$ can be found such that $\text{supp}(q) \subseteq X$. Thanks for any information that can be provided. 

Of course, a formula $\varphi$ with all these properties must be a counterexample to the Vaught's conjecture. So the real essence of this question is whether (regardless of the status of Vaught's conjecture), is it possible that the Scott rank of models of $\varphi$ take on all admissible values but no model of $\varphi$ has Scott rank in between two consecutive admissible ordinal. The natural idea to try is to use Barwise compactness to produce a model of $\varphi$ of intermediate Scott rank. However, whenever one works in a countable admissible fragment $\mathscr{L}_A$, one can not really express non-isomorphism to the model whose Scott rank is the ordinal height of the admissible set $A$. So any model $M$ produced using a Barwise argument using $L_A$, could just be isomorphic to the possibly unique model with Scott rank the ordinal height of $A$. The question is whether by some reason there must be a model of $\varphi$ whose Scott rank is between two consecutive admissible ordinals. Thanks for any information on this question. 

if $\int_x^1\frac{G(y)}{y}\,dy=\infty$, then $\mathbb{P}[\tau_0=\infty]=1$, if $\int_x^1\frac{G(y)}{y}\,dy<\infty$, then $\mathbb{P}[\tau_0=\infty]=1$ if and only if $\int_0^1 (\varphi(x)-\varphi(0))m(x)\,dx=\infty$, 

A partial but quick answer. Put the equation in the natural scale, namely take $\varphi(x)=2\frac{x-1}{x+1}$ and set $Y_t = \varphi(X_t)$, then $$ dY=\frac14(4-Y^2)f\Bigl(\frac{2+Y}{2-Y}\Bigr)\,dB, $$ where $f(x)=a+b$ if $x\leq k$ and $f(x)=a$ otherwise. Feller's test tells us that any solution starting in $y\in(-2,2)$ (consider that in the natural scale $0$ is $-2$ and $\infty$ is $2$ will go to $-2$ with probability $\frac{2-y}4$ and to $2$ otherwise, but this will not happen in finite time. In particular, the solution with initial condition $-2$ has a unique strong solution. Now, choose $a$, $b$ and $k$ so that $\frac{2+y}{2-y}$ is $\mathop{sgn}$ (this is arbitrary, i need to think about the general case), then you can proceed as in the Tanaka equation: assume you have a strong solution, apply Ito-Tanaka formula to $|Y|$ and check that the driving Brownian motion is measurable with respect to $|Y|$, a contradiction. (More details on the scale function, Feller's test, and the proof of non-existence strong solution for the Tanaka equation can be found on standard references, such as this or this) 

You won't have much luck with $\sum_j\mathbb{E}[\sup_T\langle X_t,\varphi_j\rangle^2]$, since this is not expected to converge. For simplicity say $\varphi_j$ are the eigenvectors of the Laplace operator, so that $\langle X_t,\varphi_j\rangle$ is your $X^j$. Rescale $Y^j_t = X^j(t/\lambda_j)/\sqrt{\lambda_j}$ to see that if $\mathbb{E}[\sup_T|Y^j|^2]\approx c_0T$, then $\mathbb{E}[\sup_T|X^j|^2]\approx c_0T$. On the other hand you'll have better luck with $\mathbb{E}[\sup_T\|X_t\|^2]$ (I guess $\|\cdot\|$ here is the $L^2$ norm), or even better with $\mathbb{E}[\sup_{t\leq T,x\in(0,1)}|X_t(x)|]$ (it does not make any difference for your purposes). This expectation can be estimated using Corollary 4.15 of this book (for a computation very close to the one you need and that uses the same corollary, see for instance Lemma 2.1 of this paper). Now it is just a matter of doing the required computations. 

Let $\mathbb{S}$ denote Sacks forcing. Let $\mathbb{S}_{\omega_2}$ denote the $\omega_2$-length countable support iteration of Sacks forcing. Let $G_{\omega_2} \subseteq \mathbb{S}_{\omega_2}$ be generic over $L$ for $\mathbb{S}_{\omega_2}$. By the usual results around proper forcing, you can show that $L[G_{\omega_2}] \models 2^{\aleph_0} = \aleph_2$. You can show that no Cohen reals over $L$ are added by showing that every real of $L[G_{\omega_2}]$ is contained in a ground model coded closed meager set. Note that Cohen forcing is forcing equivalent to $\mathbb{P}_{I_\text{meager}}$, the forcing of nonmeager Borel sets. Hence a Cohen real is not contained in any ground model meager set. For simplicity, let first consider one Sacks forcing $\mathbb{S}$. Let $\tau \in V^{\mathbb{S}}$ and $\tau$ be a name for a real not in the ground model. Then do a fusion argument to produce a condition $p$ so that at every split node $s$ of $p$, $p_{s0}$ and $p_{s1}$ determines a certain finite amount of $\tau$ and what $p_{s0}$ determines about $\tau$ and what $p_{s1}$ determines about $\tau$ differs in at least two places. If you let $T$ be the set of all finite strings $t$ so that $t$ is an initial segment of what $p_s$ can determined about $\tau$ for some $s \in {}^{<\omega}2$, then you get a tree so that at each split node the two sides differ two times before splitting again. By the definability of forcing, $T \in L$. You can show that body $[T]$ is meager closed set and $p \Vdash \tau \in [\check T]$. If you understand how to do this for 1-Sacks forcing, now do an iterated Sacks forcing version of this. This tends to be quite heavy in notation. See Geschke and Qickert $\textit{On Sacks Forcing and the Sacks property}$ for more information. Essentially the argument above is a modified version of their proof of the 2-localization property. Also see their paper on how to do the iterated Sacks version of the 2-localization property. 

where $\tau_0$ is the hitting time of $0$. Clearly, (1) happens for $f(x)=x^c$, $0<c<1$ and $f(x)=-x\log x$ (the order of zero in $0$ is `too' strong). To see an instance of (2) with positive probability of hitting zero, take $f(x)=\frac{a}{-\log x}$ with $a>1$. 

The inequality does not hold. Take $a,\varphi$ smooth, periodic, then integrations by parts yield $$ 0 = \int_\mathbb{T}(a\varphi^2)_{xx} = \int_\mathbb{T}(a_{xx}\varphi^2+a(\varphi^2)_{xx}+2a_x(\varphi^2)_x) = 2\int_\mathbb{T}a_{xx}\varphi - 2\int_\mathbb{T}a(\varphi^2)_{xx} = 2\Bigl(\int_\mathbb{T}a_{xx}\varphi^2-\int_\mathbb{T}a\varphi_x^2\Bigr) - 2\int_\mathbb{T}a(\varphi_x^2+2\varphi\varphi_{xx}) $$ that is $$ \int_\mathbb{T}a\varphi_x^2 - \int_\mathbb{T}a_{xx}\varphi^2 = -\int_\mathbb{T}a(\varphi_x^2+2\varphi\varphi_{xx}) $$ and there is no reason the right-hand side should be positive. Take for instance $\varphi=\cos x$ and $a=1+b$ with $b$ non-zero (and big) only where $\varphi_x^2+2\varphi\varphi_{xx}=\sin^2x-2\cos^2x$ is positive. [update] The inequality does not hold even in its general version. Say you want to prove that $\int a (\varphi_x)^2\geq\lambda\int a_{xx}\varphi^2$, then by integration by parts $\int a_{xx}\varphi^2=\int a(\varphi^2)_{xx}$ and the supposed inequality reads $\int a((\varphi_x)^2-\lambda(\varphi^2)_{xx})\geq0$. By localization (with a smooth cut-off function), it is sufficient to find a $\varphi$ (not necessarily periodic, by the same localization argument) such that $(\varphi_x)^2-\lambda(\varphi^2)_{xx}<0$ on an open set. This is easy, take $\varphi(x)=e^{a e^{bx}}$ and choose $a,b$ suitably. 

Let me denote (for consistency) by $\mathbb{P}_0$, $\mathbb{P}_1$ the given probabilities (rather than $\mathbb{P}_1$, $\mathbb{P}_2$), and set $\mathbb{P}_\alpha=(1-\alpha)\mathbb{P}_0 + \alpha\mathbb{P}_1$. Let $\mathbb{Q}$ be any probability such that $\mathbb{P}_0\ll\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{P}_1\ll\mathbb{Q}$ (any $\mathbb{P}_\alpha$ would be fine in fact, but it does not matter). Then $\mathbb{P}_\alpha\ll\mathbb{Q}$ and $G_\alpha=(1-\alpha)G_0 + \alpha G_1$, where $G_\alpha=\frac{d\mathbb{P}_\alpha}{d\mathbb{Q}}$. It is easy to check (see below) that $$ Y_\alpha = \frac{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG_\alpha|\mathcal{G}]}{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G_\alpha|\mathcal{G}]} = \frac{(1-\alpha)\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG_0|\mathcal{G}]+\alpha\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG_1|\mathcal{G}]} {(1-\alpha)\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G_0|\mathcal{G}]+\alpha\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G_1|\mathcal{G}]}. $$ To prove the claimed inequality, it is sufficient to notice that the real function $$ \alpha \mapsto\frac{(1-\alpha)x_0 + \alpha x_1}{(1-\alpha)p_0 + \alpha p_1} $$ is either non--decreasing or non--increasing. To conclude, let me prove that, if $\mathbb{P}\ll\mathbb{Q}$ and $G=\frac{d\mathbb{P}}{d\mathbb{Q}}$, then $$ \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[X|\mathcal{G}] = \frac{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG|\mathcal{G}]}{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G|\mathcal{G}]}. $$ First, if $A=\{\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G|\mathcal{G}]=0\}$, then $$ \mathbb{P}[A] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G \mathbf{1}_A] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}\bigl[\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G|\mathcal{G}]\mathbf{1}_A\bigr] = 0 $$ and the formula makes sense. For every $A\in\mathcal{G}$, $$ \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}\bigl[\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG|\mathcal{G}]\mathbf{1}_A\bigr] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG\mathbf{1}_A] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[X\mathbf{1}_A] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}\bigl[\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[X|\mathcal{G}]\mathbf{1}_A\bigr] $$ $$ = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}\bigl[\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[X|\mathcal{G}]G\mathbf{1}_A\bigr] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}\bigl[\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[X|\mathcal{G}]\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G|\mathcal{G}]\mathbf{1}_A\bigr], $$ therefore $\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[XG|\mathcal{G}] = \mathbb{E}^\mathbb{P}[X|\mathcal{G}]\mathbb{E}^\mathbb{Q}[G|\mathcal{G}]$.
