Ancient Greek has two words that are translated as life in English: zōē and bios. What is the difference between them? What are their cognates in other Indo-European languages? 

No, I don't think so. First of all, babies and toddlers are helpless and receive parenting and caring nearly 24/7. They literally have nothing to do except to passively absorb language. Second, humans are biologically designed to learn language earlier in life, just like geese imprint on their mother extremely early on during a "critical period." Adults can't learn language like babies and toddlers do because it's not supposed to be that way--that unique neurological ability to naturally pick up language is "intentionally" restricted to infancy. I can say "fui a la tienda ayer" to a new adult Spanish learner and act it out however I like--but the learner will absolutely not understand. The way babies associated meaning with words is through literally hundreds or thousands of instances of usage in different contexts and settings and environments. You probably would need, therefore, some kind of intense immersion to learn a second language in your proposed "natural" way, and this is completely unrealistic for most learners. Without total immersion, structured, organized learning is the only option. But the thing is, with babies and toddlers, when they are in their environment of immersion, they literally have no worries or needs that won't be taken care of because they don't fully grasp the language. An American can't go to Spain not knowing how to speak Spanish and then start crying when he needs to use the bathroom, which is what babies do. And I doubt he'll be able to pick up from simply listening and making repeated, frustrated attempts to express himself how to say, "Is there a public restroom nearby?" Therefore, it is necessary to teach such structured phrases and it is impractical to expect natural passive immersive absorption of language of an adult learner of a second language. 

I've seen diacritics corresponding to tones (in tonal languages), but asides from that I haven't come across a system for transcribing prosody in my studies. Is there a popular convention people use? 

Parallel to these levels are disciplines like: psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics, neurolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, computational linguistics, and speech-language pathology. (This list is by no means comprehensive!). These disciplines will use linguistic theory to answer specific questions. For example, a neurolinguist may use popular theories in phonetics and phonology as a framework to answer questions about phonological processes and their neurological realization in the brain. Now, to complicate things further--every single one of these levels of analysis have competing theories WITHIN them, and listing them all would be far beyond me. So to answer your question: tons! 

I hear that only complements and specifiers can contain the argument for a verb. But there are certain structures with ditransitive verbs I believe you can represent as an adjunct. Here's an example: "Bill gave Jessica a gift" 

Categories like "Noun" and "Adjective" can be said to be lexical categories. But what are categories like "subject" and "object" called? 

This is a really broad question, but can someone explain the difference between the following phenomena: topicalization, dislocation, shifting, inversion, discontinuity, and scrambling. Wikipedia says scrambling doesn't occur in English, so translated examples from other languages would work. I think I understand very well the phenomena on their own and their definitions and examples of them and so forth, but I want to understand the relationship among them and their categorization. 

As far as I know, basically by definition, subordinate clauses must be embedded in a matrix clause. Therefore, if sentences of the type "¡Que le vaya bien!" are subordinate, where is the matrix clause? Some have said that such constructions result from the omission of a main verb such as espero (i.e., "¡Espero que le vaya bien!"). Would Spanish speakers interpret the two sentences as equivalent then? On the other hand, if they are not subordinate, what is the function of the subordinator "que"? How should its presence be analyzed? I've looked for similar examples of subordinate clauses being used as complete sentences. The only one that came to mind is "If only . . . !" in English, but the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language says that in this case, it's just that "the apodosis is omitted." It also occurred to me that the "que + subjunctive verb" construction is similar to "would that . . ." in English, but I think it's clear with "would that . . ." that there is indeed a main verb with an omitted subject "I." 

I've never heard of any specific movement that would obligatorily accompany a specific word or phrase. However, especially if you count facial expression as movement, certain rhetoric strategies are, I believe, accompanied at least very often by movement. Sarcasm, mockery and such typically involve a specific intonation and facial expression. In that sense I can see how a certain phrase could begin to usually cooccur with a specific expression through being used primarily in an ironic sense. I suppose that this also accounts to a certain degree for the popularity of emoticons: without them it's often diffucult to decide if what one's reading is a joke or serious. I suppose yes and no might often come together with head movement but it's surely not a rule. On a theoretical ground, I can say this would be a relatively unlikely thing to happen, as being obviously redundant. The only scenario that comes to my mind that could lead to an obligatory cooccurrence, is with 'holy' or taboo words, where e.g. a certain movement could perhaps possibly be required in some culture when mentioning the name of a god, demon or something of the kind. 

I'm currently using $URL$ but it takes forever. Is there an easy way to type IPA? I've found this list of unicode keyboards over here ($URL$ but I'm not too sure how to evaluate their efficacy. I'm running off Windows if that matters. 

Lambda expressions are evaluated "hierarchically"--we resolve functions in the daughter node before we resolve functions in the mother node. In a given constituency, a sister node may define a variable for a lambda expression. But if there are three sister nodes, there will be ambiguity as to which order the variables get assigned. Does this mean that syntax trees must be binary branching in order for lambda calculus to work? 

Say word set 1 = {[kæt], [bæt]}, and word set 2 = {[sænd],[bænd]} and word set 3 = {[xʔxʔ],[a]} Is there an common index or method to characterize how phonetically similar these tokens are within a set and between sets? For example [kæt] is different from [bæt] by one phone, but different from [sænd] by 3 phones. 

In english, taboo language may be realized as swear words--though I could see some languages not having "swear words" in the english sense, while maintaining "vulgar expressions". All cultures have taboos. However, do all cultures have linguistic taboos? 

What different definitions of phoneme do you know? Please note that I'm not asking for an explanation of what phoneme is but rather for professional definitions. I'm interested in how the issue is tackled in different phonological theories. Edit: It sure is very interesting (no irony) to see how different authors explain why they're not going to refer to phoneme in their work. However, if you come across a definition (of the kind of definitions of terms that they have in mathematics), I will be still grateful if you cared to add it or refer to it here. 

makes no sense if used alone, modifies the grammatical (syntactic, if you will) function of the word it is attached to, does not modify the semantics of the word it is attached to, and can be used with at least an entire group of words (see below). 

This is a good observation and a good question, and the comments below it make a valid point, as well. In short, I would say that there is no such thing as a solid cross-linguistic concept of 'proper nouns' -- or at least, none commonly accepted and adhered to. My own experience is that the term is primarily used to refer to what you could call prototypical proper nouns (Coca-Cola, Berlin, John Brown &c.), and rarely to not so clear cases. I suppose there might have been more than one attempt at a proper definition, but neither has gained enough following to be even known of by the majority of linguists. Here a long and passionate rant is in order on the attitude towards properly defined terms in linguistics, but instead I'll just say that you might not be able to even find a single term which every linguist understands the same way for every language. You will, however, have no difficulty finding a linguist who can't give a proper and cross-linguistically solid definition for virtually any term he or she's used while talking to you. Basing a definition on language-specific spelling is obviously not a great idea, although in some cases it might be the best we have. 'Whatever's written between spaces' remains the best definition of word I know. If you were to create a definition of your own, I suppose you should try to capture the common and distinctive features of the prototypical cases. You should not, however, get your hopes up about how many linguists will memorize it and adhere to it. It's a hopeless bunch in this regard. 

Part of the difficulty surrounding donkey sentences, to my understanding, is about how hard they are to translate to FOL in a matter that is consistent with other translations to FOL in english. Take "every man who owns a donkey beats it". The knee-jerk translation would look something like this: 

I can see how SL can be a decent metalanguage for doing cross-linguistic semantic work, but I feel like it's severely limited by the fact that you can't translate any kind of non-declarative sentence. This is means that only tiny fraction of any one given language can ever be logically represented. How is symbolic logic useful in linguistics? 

Phonemes are realized through phones, morphemes are realized with morphs. What is the corresponding word for a lexeme? A casual google search isn't telling me much. 

Here are a few suggestions: There is a MOOC being offered through Coursera: $URL$ The virtual linguistics campus has some good content and is well taught but might be difficult to navigate for a new student. It's good if you have a topic in mind: $URL$ The ling space gives a lot of quick high-level explanations of important lingustic phenomena--I've even found it useful in my own classes $URL$ If you want to drill down into grammar and x-bar theory, I'd recommend this series of calming and zen-like videos by Caroline Heycock $URL$ The Study of Language by George Yule is a great introduction to linguistics, and is written in a way that's very accessible to newcomers. $URL$ All Things Linguistic is an awesome blog by Gretchen McCulloch, and has a lot of resources and advice for students in addition to delving into some interesting linguistic topics $URL$ 

A complement to the answers above: The alphabet used for transcribing and the level of transcription are frequently confused. IPA can, just as any other alphabet, be used for both phonetic and phonemic transcription (the difference has already been neatly explained), or anything in between. One might argue IPA is richer, poorer, more or less readable, flexible, regular, whatever, but in principle there is nothing in it, or any other alphabet, that forces you to use it at any particular level of abstraction. Alphabet and level of abstraction are two independent variables. 

In native Turkic phonology, [k] and [ḱ] are allophones; [k] only occurs in a back environment, while [ḱ] only in a front environment. The same goes for [g] : [ǵ] and [l] : [ĺ], and no other consonant. Examples from Turkish: 

There are consonant alternations in Russian but they work in a somewhat different way than in Celtic, and therefore I'm not sure that it's a good idea to call them the same name, mutation. In short and off the top of my head, 

I saw the statement a few times that sign languages inflect in the same way that spoken languages do, but all examples I came across refer to phenomena that I would classify as word formation rather than actual inflection. (Edit.) So my question is this: does any sign language possess a unit (hand or finger movement, facial expression, anything really) that: 

I'd like to see a spectral representation of my left and right channels individually. I'm not sure which channel Praat's spectrogram corresponds to. How do I show multiple spectrograms, with each corresponding to a different channel? 

What I did here is extend the scope of the existential to encapsulate the BEATS predicate. Next, I included a conjunction that included another instance of the predicate DONKEY to make the formula more rigorous (because it would evaluate as true if we interpreted y as a pig/non-donkey object). Finally, I moved the conditional after the MAN predicate to "tidy up" the universal and existential quantifiers. From my intuition, the sentence "every man who owns a donkey beats it" doesn't suffer from ambiguity unless you interpret "beats it" as masturbating. So what's wrong with my translation into formal logic? Am I missing the point of donkey sentences? Edit: I suspect that this stems from the basic fact that it's discouraged to say ∀x(Px&Qx) compared to ∀x(Px->Qx), but I'm not completely sure why asides from the fact that it's "too strong a claim". 

For future people who may need this, I ended up writing a webscraper and compiling everything from www.minpairs.talktalk.net. You can view/download the corpus here: $URL$ 

Actually, the traditional distinction between morphology and syntax is pretty clear. Morphology studies how words are inflected and new forms created, while syntax studies how they are combined into phrases and sentences. So, for example, do > does would be an issue in morphology while dog barks : does dog bark? would be an issue in syntax. The whole confusion arose in the Anglo-Saxon world because English expresses with syntax most of what non-analytic languages express with morphology. As long as the main objects of study for linguistis were Latin and Greek, I don't think anyone mixed the two terms. But after WW2 English became the dominant language and with it, the confusion spread. Linguists who are under weaker influence of American linguistics, however, i.e. those who did not study in an Anglo-Saxon country, or who do not specialize in theoretical linguistics, usually make a very clear distinction between syntax and morphology, often combined with looking down on those who don't. You ask if the distinction is meaningful. Absolutely. It is only in a purely analytic language that syntax can tackle the issues of morphology. But not even English is purely analytic, so if you stick to the traditional understanding, even in English there are problems (e.g. the formation of plural) that syntax can't deal with. It is only because there is so little morphology in English that the term syntax came to mean for Anglo-Saxons both syntax and morphology simultaneously. 

That is to say, is the deep structure supposed to be what's happening in our head when we speak a language? Or is this just to make our model of a grammar consistent? 

I'm writing some software that will need to do a bit of phonetic analysis. Are there any programs, libraries, or software packages that I can extend to my program which are commonly used for real-time phonetic analysis? I'm aware of software like Praat and WaveSurfer, but to my knowledge I don't think I can send/receive data from them in real time. Asides from those, other NLP tool-kits seem to output on the lexical/phrasal level, which is not the level of analysis I'm looking for. 

Update here: I ended up using phonological corpus tools to calculate the phonological edit distance between sets of transcriptions. If interested my code is over here. 

I think that this really boils down to level of analysis. (Formal) semantics asks: are there atomic units of meaning, and if so, how do they combine to form linguistic meaning? Of course, this is not a full explanation of linguistic meaning, as not all meaning in a sentence can be explained by reducing it to its atomic units. There are other studies of meaning, such as pragmatics that aim to address dimensions of meaning that is non-compositional. So you can consider "semantics" to be a disciplinary term within linguistics, and "meaning" to refer to the broad phenomena of meaningfulness.
