I was fiddling with my Facebook security and privacy settings when I stumbled to this option (which I wasn't aware was controllable!). 

These outbursts are damaging the work environment and may emotionally affect the other employees. The work productivity is most probably affected, and as HR, it is your job to take action to keep your employees at their best possible shape to work productively for the company. You said you talked with him and I think that's great, but if it's still continuing, you have to devise other methods. Maybe he needs a short break from work to calm himself, or some other thing you can think of to improve his situation. But I believe action must be done, and it must be done fast. P.S. Take my advice with a grain of salt as I am no expert in these types of things. :) 

I'm in quite of a bind here. Although this is unintentional, I've found myself in an awkward situation where I've been offered a job that I'm interested in while being on annual leave, and I'm not coming back for 1 more week. I'm currently overseas where coming back isn't an option unless I wait for my return flight which comes in a week. I don't exactly have the luxury of time to wait until next week to personally hand in my resignation letter, so I'm looking to do it by email. Is there anything I should be aware of? Anything ethics related, or when the notice period starts, and things I could do to smoothen the process? Thanks! 

If you had experience with a project or a company that practiced six-sigma, I would say iffy but okay. Because it appears that you have neither training nor experience in six-sigma, just don't do it. You'll just upset your interviewers when they ask for details of your six-sigma experience. 

Americans also have greater personal distance. Two American colleagues will stand farther apart than two European colleagues. That will also tend to raise the volume. I don't know if this is the case in your workplace, but I could see Americans more likely to talk across a cubicle wall (or two) or "shout" across the hallway. Edited to add a reference and to limit comparison to Northern Europeans. 

Ask for references! That is, people who are currently using the space. The space manager could still give you bad contact info just as they could lie in a phone call, but that might weed out some of the possibilities. 

When trying to get out of this role, try this slant. You should be earning more than the support analysts--the company is wasting money by having you spend time on this rather than developing full-time. 

Americans, in general, are louder than Northern Europeans. We (yes, I'm an American) just talk louder. I've personally seen it when visiting or having meetings with colleagues who are based in Europe. I have to consciously think about lowering my volume to match theirs. Not a published research paper, but a reference from the Divsersity Council: 

So we have a situation where the customer wants an update but the vendor doesn't want to do it, and asking politely hasn't worked. Yelling at tier 1 won't accomplish anything. You need to convince the company that they want to do it. How you do that depends on how much contract muscle you have with them. If your service contract entitles you to this kind of service, then wave it at them. Begin with "This call is being recorded." Yes, they are likely recording their end but this puts the agent on notice that you have a copy too. Get someone to formally decline to make the change, then tell them your company's lawyers will be in touch and they might want to get the going-to-court suit cleaned. I once made a government agency go away, permanently, with this technique. Send recordings of the calls to your boss. If you do not have any contract leverage, you have to make them want to push out an update. Since your boss said "any means necessary", get everyone else in the company to call the vendor's support desk and complain about the bug. Then call again. This will involve a lot of waiting on hold but that's what speaker phones are for. And don't worry about putting their agent on hold while you take your own calls. Remember who's paying whom here, and remind the vendor of that as well. Frequently, as they have apparently forgotten. The winner here will be the one with the greater phone resources and/or patience. Make sure everyone tracks their time and send a frequent report to your boss. I have generally found that being rather firm with T1 support, followed by "I would be happy to take this up with your supervisor / T2" results in a quick transfer to the next level up, but I do not accept voicemail. Their boss is paid more to handle these things, so they can handle it. If the vendor's office is in the same city, pay them a visit (remember, Boss said "any means necessary"). The next step, open warfare, depends heavily on which country you and the vendor are in. Get your boss to approve a budget and schedule in advance. 

One thing you can say to your colleagues is: "I'm working with my doctor to try to reduce the symptoms, but so far, this is the best we can do! I'm sorry that you find it annoying." Hopefully it's a true statement, and you are working with a doctor. It acknowledges the problem and lets them know that you are actively working on the issue. Side note: I haven't tried it, but I have acquaintances who swear by nasal irrigation (search 'neti pot'). One races bicycles semi-professionally so comes into contact with a lot of allergens. Have a study. 

I have a few ideas. Follow @paparazzi's advice (move the magnet inside your cubicle). Round up some fellow alumni to join in and put magnets on the outsides of their cubicles. Try to acquire magnets from all the universities in the group and put them all on the outside of your cubicle. Tape the magnet to your cubicle. Or otherwise secure it. If you're putting it on the metal edge of your cubicle wall, run twine or string over it and secure with pushpins. Or, you're an engineer--think up some fun solution! 

Because the report is not freely available, it's difficult to be sure. My assumption is that "hours available" are the possible hours of training provided by the employer. These could be applicable courses, equivalent of reimbursable tuition, etc. The report's finding is that employees are only using 2% of their opportunities for training. 

Additional info : I'm planning to leave, in case I can't work under Y directly. So I guess that adds to my negotiating power. 

Send applications on late April to early May, and be able to do interviews before vacation starts. If the question "When will you be able to start?" comes up, I'll mention my schedule. Send applications during vacation stating that I'll only be able to attend interviews starting on June 26. Both of the above Only start applying when I get back home 

Given this, I personally think I could reduce the "unemployment" gap if I started applying early. However, given my vacation schedule, I wouldn't be able to attend interviews in that time period. These are the options I can see right now : 

How early could you apply generally for jobs? How much waiting time can you give employers before you are able to work? Is it a deal breaker for employers if the applicants aren't available in 1-4 weeks' time? 

Here's my situation : I currently am in a contractual job and my contract will end on September. From the time of this posting, I would only be available 2.5 months from now. I am already seeing good job postings that I want to apply to, but I'm worrying that it might be too early that when I do get to the offer stage, it might be awkward to tell the employer that I'll only be available by the 1st week of October. Questions : 

In most jurisdictions, 16 years is old enough to work part time. You were paid above minimum wage which means the employer is 100% within their rights and responsibilities. If you can prove that you were paid less than an equivalent employee at the same time/ location/ shift for clearly discriminatory reasons (female, black etc.) then you may have a legitimate complaint. Being paid less than other employees that have 10 years experience and a relevant college degree doesn't count, they are not "equivalent" to your position. You mentioned that you compared your pay to "other professionals". At 16 you are not a professional - you are barely qualified to answer the phone. Employers have no obligation to pay any "going wage" - they have a legal requirement to pay the minimum wage. Employees have the right to not work for that employer. You appear to have exercised that right by quitting. 

That's quite a sense of entitlement. Unless your boss agreed to pay you $15 / hour and withheld $7 for questionable reasons you get nothing "back" as it was not yours to begin with. Your employer offered you a job at a certain rate, you accepted. That this rate was below market is your failure for not researching what that job normally paid for a person with your qualifications. Again, you don't compare yourself to a trained chocolatier, you would be looking at the entry-level zero-experience wage, and I'll bet that's right around the minimum you received. 

This answer does not answer the original question about blacklisting. However, I think it's important enough to deserve a separate answer rather than a comment. She needs to be very careful with this. If she is currently on FMLA leave (Family Medical Leave Act) and quits while on it, the company can require repayment of the company's share of health plan premiums that they paid while she was on FMLA leave. They can also stop health care benefits (subject to COBRA) immediately upon learning that she doesn't plan to return to work. Some info here. The particular statement is in 825.311 and more detailed information in 825.213. Many companies probably won't bother trying to recover the premiums. If word got out, it could be a public relations nightmare, but the possibility is there. Thanks to Joe Strazzere for a link to better information. 

Let's assume you're stuck with this role in the short term. I think there are some things you can do to make it easier to live with. Some of it would fit better in Productivity SE! 

As far as possible, arrange a specific time for a customer call via email so you're not calling multiple times. The customer will likely also appreciate this. Alternatively: have one of the analysts call. If they connect, they can transfer the call to you. By 1st level support, do you mean the run-of-the-mill questions or the escalated/complex issues? You should only be handling the latter personally. If the former, see about escalating the calls to 2nd level support. Connected to (2), if they don't exist yet, start publishing more FAQs, canned responses, etc. to reduce the number of calls that must be reviewed or handled by you. Particularly on developer days, set up specific times when you will review/sign off on support issues. Try also to have one person collate the information and present it to minimize the disruption. Finally, see if there is anyone that you can train to take over this role or even specific duties. You may need to convince your manager that this person or persons should have different titles and raises. If you can identify a new team lead or supervisor who can handle some duties, particularly on your developer days, that will make your life much easier.
