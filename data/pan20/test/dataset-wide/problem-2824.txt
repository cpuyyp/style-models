When the oracle is sufficiently autonomous, not exerting relevant physical influence on the part of the universe she's trying to predict, her prediction plays only role 2. But if she's going to answer John, role 1 becomes inevitable. In the above example, the prediction as a physical influence on the universe happens to cause it to evolve in a way that contradicts the semantics of the prediction. Notice that this reasoning has nothing to do with so called free will whatsoever. It is only the structure of the (deterministic) universe and semantics of language that make the prediction impossible. But what's the implication? Can we conclude that we can't expect the oracle to answer arbitrary questions about the future, even though, or should we say, precisely because, she is omniscient? Or there always will be questions about the future that will remain unknowable to you, even with the help of the oracle? People have been written much about oracles and prophecies since ancient times. It is interesting to note that many of them work in mysterious ways, writing their prophecies only in the form of obscurely ambiguous poems or nearly inscrutable text. I'd like to think perhaps a real oracle will be just like that, bound to write down her knowledge in a strange way. 

Think of an oracle telling you the prediction. Because the universe is deterministic, whether you will be standing or sitting in 10 secs is a function f(v1,v2) of only two variables: v1. the initial state of your brain (and maybe some ambient environment) and v2. the "Standing" or "Sitting" you heard from the oracle. Saying the divulging oracle can always make a correct prediction is the same as requiring f(v1,v2="Standing")=standing & f(v1,v2="Sit")=sitting, which may or may not be realizable depending on the initial state v1 of your brain. Now think of the oracle and you as in fact the same person. The implication is you may not be able to tell/convince/divulge to yourself what you will do in 10 secs, not because of ignorance, but because your brain is in such a counter-reactional initial state: f(v1,v2="Standing")=sitting & f(v1,v2="Sit")=standing. I'd like to think that's why we often see oracles possessed by some other identities when making predictions, or write their prophecies in obscure and inscrutable words. That's the price they have to pay make their predictions consistent in a deterministic world :-P 

This is a comment that is too long to be posted as such. user21820's solution to the (Strengthened) Liar seems reasonable to me: we can't prove the Liar is grounded; for that, we'd need to show there exists a grounded sentence L which is equivalent to the grounded sentence "L is not a true sentence". In general, circular definitions can't be assumed to be valid: this is akin to the fact that, in mathematics, recursive function definitions must be accompanied, at least implicitly, by grounding theorems. Some philosophers would criticize such solution by saying that there are unproblematic circular sentences, such as 'This sentence has more than 2 characters'. But we can simply rewrite such sentence as "'This sentence has more than 2 characters' has more than 2 characters". Note that the inner string need not be grounded as a sentence in order for the outer string to be grounded as a sentence, for the latter simply makes a claim about the former's syntax. We can easily conclude from reasonable assumptions that the sentence is grounded. If we tried to do the same for the Liar, the inner string would need to be grounded first, but it would be precisely the Liar all over again. Furthermore, sentences such as "This sentence is true" would not be provably grounded, which is OK, since they don't seem of much use anyway. There are circular sentences that are useful in practice and that don't seem to be groundable, though. Note how I said "This is a comment that is too long to be posted as such" above. It is not clear how such statement can be proved to be grounded. We could reformulate it as "What follows is a comment that is too long to be posted as such", but that would slightly change the meaning. Also, problems would arise because I'm mentioning the statement here as well, making everything circular again. Thoughts on this last point? 

Side-Note: While i understand reading Kant and important former german philosophers, i think its not really productive if you are interested in todays philosophy of mind. Kant/Hegel use a very special and own terminology. Many english academic philsophers learned German, as translation of those texts is very tricky and not possible in 1:1 way. You really have to be aware in which ways philsophers at this time were biased, to understand their views, what philosophical movements competed at this time, what the historical context was. Also science is a social process according to Thomas Kuhn and cannot be analysed by pure logic, unfortunately :) 

The most simple example i can think of is the category mistake, a kind of fallacy. A known aphorism is: 

Kant was convinced that self-consciousness and cognition can only originate from a separate transcendental I, the empirical apperception is necessary, but not sufficient to explain spontaneity: 

Your analysis misses a bit the historical status quo and situation. Kants philosophy of Transcendental Idealism tried to yield a compromise between empirism and rationalism at this time by formulating a dualistic philosophy with inherent known contradictions. 

Also you have to consider on what knowledge of nature, animals, humans, mental disorders the reasoning of philosophers was based at this time. They thought of animals as totally mindless bio-cybernetic machines while only humans are capable of self-consciousness and spontaneity. So they were deeply biased to dualistc views, which of course based on our present knowledge in physics, evolution theory, neurophysiology is pretty laughable. We know of feral childs who behave like animals, we can control the motorics of mice with electrical brain implantations...Dualism is dead, current philosophy thinks mainly in monoistic concepts (physicalism/reductionism) of emergence and supervenience. You can better understand and analyse this situation, when reading philosophers following Kant, like Hegel, who tried to overcome the flawed dualistic seperation of subject and object in the philosophy of Kant: 

It seems to me and many others that can we solve the Liar's Paradox by saying that the Liar Sentence "This sentence is false" doesn't express a proposition. However, both the IEP and the SEP claim that such solution to the Liar Paradox is defeated by a Strengthened Liar: (i) This sentence is either false or meaningless. (IEP) (ii) This sentence does not express a true proposition. (SEP) One would presumably derive a contradiction analyzing, say, (ii), thus: if (ii) expresses a true proposition, then, since it says it doesn't express a true proposition, it follows that it doesn't express a true proposition. Contradiction. If (ii) doesn't express a true proposition, then, since it says it doesn't express a true proposition, it follows that it expresses a true proposition. Contradiction. The fault in the analysis, in my view, is in bold: (ii) doesn't say anything! It is much like "How old are you?" or "weofjwojiajzoijfeowi". That's essentially what it means to not express a proposition. It is also claimed in the linked IEP article that saying the Liar Sentence is meaningless simply because "otherwise we get a paradox" is an ad hoc remark and, therefore, not a solution. Yet any set theorist will give you precisely that explanation when asked "Why can't we form sets of the form {x: φ(x)} for arbitrary formulas φ?". And people seem to be satisfied with that answer. Just like the naive notion of forming sets by unrestricted comprehension is abandoned because it leads to contradiction, so should the naive notion that the Liar Sentence expresses a proposition. Why isn't it enough to say the Liar Sentence doesn't express a proposition?
