Model theory is applied to axiomatic systems to give them an interpretation. Now consider a logic in axiomatic form. When we consider a model of this logic and some sentence in the logic, each variable in the sentence is interpreted in a some set. From another perspective this appears to be assigning a type to that variable. Is that the case? Is model theory for logic essentially the same as type theory - but where syntax is separated from semantics - that is we think of type as semantics? 

One could add that the development that you've outlined is 'familiarity with a particular tour' - that of triangles! He adds: 

Simone Weil from what I've read is commonly taken to have experienced a mystical event, though she did not consider to take herself to be a Christian in the orthodox sense; but this is prefigured in her own early writings at one of the grandes ecoles; Finch, wrote in his Intellect of Grace that 

In the latter half of Capital (volume 1) he describes his anger at the inequity of Early Capitalism; so, yes; there is a moral imperative there; but this moral anger was shared by a wide spectrum of people in 19C England/Europe - for example Chartism;but its not simply about distribution of income; 

Certain styles of philosophical, particularly in the analytic school appears to follow this rule; where the conclusion is stated first and then the argument is developed to support it; still Quine for example, in his essay on 'what there is' adopts a more narrative style; and actually quite slyly his opening sentence is adopted from Nabakovs Lolita, compare: 

However, it also seems to be true, if we suppose that Void is the Parmenidian Non-Being, that the object has no-where to move to. So it cannot move. Hence, for an object to move it must be immersed in Being - the simplest such is pure Place; and therefore pure Place has Being. Theres probably a lot wrong with this argument, but I find it interesting. My proper question is What is the referent for Parmenidian Being? One suspects it must tie in with this world here. 

Platos theory of Forms is expanded, criticised and defended most fully in his late dialogue Parmenides. One of the themes of this dialogue is to understand the relationship of the Forms and the World. (At least to me, the theory of Forms is a Pythagorean theme that was picked up by Plato). At one point Socrates considers the Forms as being immanent in Nature, this is picked up and expanded by Aristotle in his Physics and Metaphysics as hylomorphism, which is a considered as an indivisible union of form and substance. This appears to connect with Hegels notion (begriff). Its a curious feature of the Parmenidian Dialogue that he mentions the master/slave relationship as an Idea; this ties this dialogue in some way with Hegel, as he infamously/famously describes this as a dialectic. Another theme of the dialogue, is a sustained meditation on the One vs the Many; that this is a contrary pair, is yet another Pythagorean theme. At one point a question is raised are the Ideas/Forms themselves, One or Many; as the Forms participate in each other. As One, it's compared from the All or Whole (that which has parts); two themes treated again by Aristotle; and also from the Infinite (that which is not finite, the finite being understood as that being traversable) again treated by Aristotle. 

So Arendt is rescuing the ancient art of rhetoric, the art by which politics acts by persuasion, and that Plato denounced in favour of the art of contemplation. 

Her central preoccupation is to examine the tragic vision of poets & dramatists, centrally occupied with powerful emotions, such as arrogance, hubris, pathos and pity (one thinks of trilogy of Oedipus Rex), in contrast to the anti-tragic vision of Plato (the rational, reflective and jocular Socrates), as reflected in the unadorned language of his dialogues - or dramas, but centrally unconcerned with drama - a direct riposte to the dramatists art. She then examines the balancing act of Aristotle who attempts to synthesise a whole from two diametrically opposite visions. 

Given that analytical philosophy is closely tied to analysis of how language is used, I would suggest that a close examination of the word concept and how it is used in philosophical discourse (as opposed to its ordinary usage). This does mean rather examining a large corpus of works, and one would need to decide whether one should look at solely analytical works, or also continental - or both. I'm more familiar with continental work rather than analytical, so I'll start there. Kant had a notion of concept: 

I liked Fritjof Capras The Tao of Physics which ties physics to eastern philosophy, the Tao. Michael Serres The Birth of Physics riffs off Epicurean physics on the notion of the aleatory and indiscernable clinamen; and he writes in the grand French manner. Sorabjis *Space, time & matter scholarly in the best tradition and he writes here of physics or rather natural philosophy in late antiquity, though 

First, this is a great question. Second, I agree with Whiteheads later formulation - a proposition has to be interesting for it to hold our attention. Truth overlaps with this, but is clearly not synonymous. When Keats was affirming that Truth is Beauty & Beauty Truth - it appears he is contradicting this - but he was asserting as much and more. For in his time Truth had exceeded Beauty - the wonders of the enlightenment and the light of philosophy had shrivelled Beauty - he wished people could see that Beauty was at least the equal of Truth, and he dared for more. Some mathematicians, I do not know if Whitehead would approve, say a proposition is 'morally' true. They are, it appears, to be asserting a judgement. Underlying it is the feeling, if it isn't - it should be. Another way of looking at this: if an idea is interesting, how can we make it come true. An example: prime numbers look like they could be made into prime knots. This way you're tying geometry to number, and tying two different notions of primality together. This is interesting (at least to mathematicians). For one is not merely making one the mere reflection of the other, but also putting two different ontologies of mathematics in dialogue - sparking off new conversations and charting new territories. It is quite clear that there are many, many truths in mathematics that are not vacuous, not trivial but are not interesting. Being merely true is not enough in the aesthetics and practise of mathematics. Being merely true is akin to a merely clever proof signifying nothing other than virtousity. Like a man who can play the violin with his feet. When we examine the proposition 'Grass is green' we examine it in a denuded context. The proposition does not attain its full form. It is always framed by our educated subjectvity which positions it for the expected reading. 

Aristotle was the first philosopher to describe the notion of ousia, that is substance; it is that which is self-subsistent and depends on nothing else - which is one reason why it's been imported into theology as a part of theorising on the nature of God; for example, Spinoza calls God the neccessary substance. In Physics, though matter as a substance is a kind of analogue; but not quite - matter is not independent of energy, or momentum; or time and space; to correspond with the traditional idea one notion ought to be selected as foundational. Spinoza, following Descarte chose the notion of extension - given that space, time, matter and motion have magnitude; but given his theology he represented as a mode of a substance, rather than as a substance per se. 

And why were we at home? Because there is a joy at being at home; joy is then our neccessary accompaniment; and when enjoying we didn't notice the time pass, or the distance gone; or even the goal was unreachable, and being unreachable - reached. And a little Nietzschian irony that explains itself: 

The answer is yes, no and maybe - the answer being dependent on whether one takes an empirical or philosophical perspective. Empirically laws do change. Although its commonly taken that Newon discovered gravity, in fact everyone does, its so obvious that it geneally doesn't usually warrant the name of a law. Aristotle had a dual nature of gravity where celestial objects moved in circles and terrestial objects moved in striaght lines towards the centre of the earth. Newtons discovery can then be put in perspective as seeing that these two separate phenomena where aspects of one force. Hence Universal gravity. But there was a lacuna in his theory - how was force transmitted at a distance? Einstein fixed this by showing gravity was curvature of spacetime. He discovered this by pondering on the fixed speed of light which went against Galilean mechanics. This fixed speed of light is seen as one of the fundamental fixed constants of physics. But some physicists have speculated that the speed is not constant always, close to the big bang they have considered how & why it might change - this being a proposal to explain some cosmological features whose standard explanation is inflation. Philosophically, that is metaphysically, that is after or before physics - one can consider whether the true laws of physics - the ones that physics aim at - are they fixed or not. This is a tricky question. First the laws may be fixed but our descriptions of them may vary. Secondly they may be fixed but we may never know this - since there is no reason per se that new laws come into existence at higher and higher energies. Perhaps there is a law whose effect is only apparent at energies close to the big bang. For this reason physicists generally talk about laws upto a certain energy. Further, taking a Kantian perspective, or correlationist in some contemporary discourse, the laws of nature as understood or intuited by us are within only the phenomenal realm; in the noumenal realm, it exists as the phenomenal world supervenes on it, but it itself is indescribable, having no attributes we can ever hope to have purchase on. If one then considers nature in its proper sense to be both this world of phenomena and the world of noumena then one can say that the larger part of nature is forever out of reach. Or one can take a Spinozan perspective. If God exists as the solely neccessary self-subsistent sunstance, and the world is his creation, then supposing nothing can come from nohing, the world itself is a part of God, for this Spinoza was denounced as a Pantheist; further he said that God had an infinite number of modes, with only two being cognisant by us - extension and thought. So again when world is considered as a whole, the larger part of the world, that is God, is beyond us. An Islamic perspective take all laws to be fixed by God except for human beings who are endowed with free will to make ethical choices. So all laws of nature at bottom until revoked by God are at bottom fixed. One could suppose that God could unfix these laws, but this goes against the spirit of what is meant by Nature here. The world of natural phenomena in the world. 

There is a programme of inconsistent mathematics which revives and completes Hilberts logicist programme by defanging Russells Paradox and the incompleteness theorems of Godels. Can inconsistency/paraconsistency provide insights into Physics as well? And what would this mean for the philosophy of Physics? Has there been any research done along these lines? The SEP/IEP has nothing about the possible physical ramifications of inconsistency. Though given the symbiotic relationship between mathematics and physics one expects there to be some. It does mention a couple of geometric incarnations of paraconsistency that may have fruitful physical consequences: a. gluing of geometries along boundaries - the boundary belongs to the first & not the second and not to the first but to the second (and to both?). Gluing is important in toy theories of QG such as TQFTs. b. Open set logic is intuitionistic; its dual closed set logic is paraconsistent. Perhaps when a state collapses phenomenologically when provoked by a measurement (but ontologically not) this could instead be instead be interpreted as a state not having a specific value and having a specific value - which gets rid of the phenomenology - perhaps, as this is all pure speculation. EDIT Andreas Doring, who works on Topos interpretation of Physics as initiated by Chris Isham has the following paper where he explains: 

Radium atoms decay by emitting alpha particles at random. Are these events without cause? Of course one may take a closer look at radium nuclei to determine a possible reason why they decay; for example a hidden-variables model of QM may provide an explanation. But the essential question I'm driving at is this: if random events occur in nature are they then by definition without cause? (The above example being simply a concrete illustration). example: If we find a particular atom decays, and we later find out that its a Radium atom - we could say it decays because it is a Radium atom. In fact this is a tautological statement. We still haven't found the cause. EDIT If an event is determined by its circumstances, only that event occurs and no other. If its undetermined by circumstances, then given something must happen, a range of possible events present themselves. Either all occurs, or one of these possible events occur and this choice must be taken at random, ( for if not, it is determined, and we're not interested in this case here). An epistemologicaly random event is one which has only the appearance of randomness, given more precise knowledge of the events circumstances, one can determine why this event occurs as opposed to another. For example, a dice throw given Newtonian Mechanics is such an event. If one could precisely know how the dice is thrown and thus model its trajectory one can explain why a five occurs rather than a six. An ontologically random event is one which knowledge of circumstances is not a barrier; it is random by fiat. In principle completely precise knowledge of circumstances will not enable prediction in a precise sense (a statistical prediction is still possible). 

Sure; if one interprets phenomenology as experiment, and recalling that physics is an experimental/empirical science; for example phenomenology in particle physics is the art : 

So, it was already understood that some principle is neccessary to understand the forms of the Forms, to delimit them, and their number. 

Which as an idea appears in Nietzsche. Further, consider that both positioned themselves as bards and prophets. But this appears to be not the case; but it does appears that both were influenced by the Transcendentalism of Emerson: the over-soul and his 'foolish consistency'. But why is one taken to be a philosopher and the other a poet; when it appears that both were philosopher-poets? 

There is the Sorites paradox that shows sometimes things and ideas don't scale: ie how large must a molehill be before it becomes a mountain. If you're discounting democracy (and it isn't true by the way that democracies are as simple in their political constitution as you're making out) then what other political arrangement makes sense? Monarchy, oligarchy, tyranny? These are the classical options outlined by Aristotle. I'd suggest the question of tax comes from the wrong end; and should start with the question of public services ie roads, schools, hospitals - and how their provision is to be funded; the question here is in terms of size of organisation, inclusivity, and values proper to the institutions. But there is the larger question of what constitutes a society; and the role of an individual within it. The private realm for Arendt is the site of the family; and the public realm is where private individuals become citizens. But this notion of the individual needs further examining: individuals aren't born as individuals, they're born into families; and families are the locus of their maturing into adulthood; without a family an individual isn't one as such; similarly, families (despite tales like the swiss family robinson) do not exist in a social vacuum - they take their place in a social unit, a linguistic community, and a political arrangement (however loose it maybe, as in a tribal confederation) or strict (as in a city-state). This is one of the points of the classic novel, Lord of the Flies, by Golding: just how quickly a society falls apart into a bare life of savagery, when it's disciplinary institutions are taken away. And this shouldn't be termed as a critique of the nomadic life, as in certain traditional forms of life, as they have their own institutions proper to them.
