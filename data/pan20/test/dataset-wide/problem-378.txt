According to this page from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, average soybean production is 44 bushels per acre, and each bushel can make 1.5 gallons of bio-diesel fuel. So let's math. To get 100,000 gallons of fuel, you'd need to produce 66,667 bushels of soybeans. To produce that many bushels, you'd need 1,515.15 acres of land. For comparison's sake, that's a bit bigger than half of Central Park. You have 25 farmers, so each of them would need to be working 60.6 acres. Now, I'm no farmer, so I don't know for sure whether that's feasible or not without mechanization. Now, of course after the first year, once fuel production is running, you can use the fuel to mechanize, so it seems like it should be workable. The issue, then, is that you're using all of your farmers to grow fuel instead of food, but that can be worked around through trading - fuel is probably more valuable than food in the post-apocalypse, so you're probably okay there. Ultimately, I'd say your best bet would be to start with lower production so that you can have guaranteed food the first year, then use the fuel to increase soybean production for trade in later years. 

This system has a few problems of its own however. Inheritance becomes a bit messy; based on the above system, a type 1 and a type 4 could have either type 1 or type 4 children, but a type 1 and a type 3 would always have type 5 children, and a type 5 and a type 6 could have either type 3, type 4, type 5, or type 6 children. Also, it's difficult to justify why one particular combination would be non-magical but all other combinations were of equal strength. We can't just make allele C nonfunctional, because then there'd be no difference between types 1 and 5 and between types 2 and 6. You could get around this by making allele C be unable to function on its own, making type 3 non-magical, but to change the effect of allele A or B if its also present. This is perfectly biologically valid, but it still ties types 1 and 5 and types 2 and together somewhat. So this is now getting into the realm of exactly what these types of magic are, how they relate to each other and what common features they might have. An alternative explanation could be that two of the alleles, say A and B, have "opposite" effects that cancel each other out. Maybe the A and B enzymes recognize each other as foreign and try to consume each other, but don't mind themselves (obviously) and are okay with enzyme C. Or maybe the molecules they produce destructively react together (imagine if A gives you magic through the power of baking soda, C through the power of water, and B through the power of vinegar. Stupid example but hopefully it makes my point). This would be very similar to how blood type works, as discussed in John's answer. It doesn't have to be one gene, however. There could be two genes essential for magic, or three, or six. There are many increasingly complex ways this could work. I'll write more if I think of any that are particularly interesting. 

Honestly, it probably wouldn't work all that well. The simple facts are that there's only so much that an individual person can do in a day, and there are a lot of different places on Earth. Those two things combined kind of ruin the idea of a unified world government that runs everything. Let's run through things a bit to see what I mean, but on a smaller scale. Congratulations! You've just been elected President of the United States! You've had a few minutes to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and laugh maniacally at your newfound power, but now it's time to get down to business. The budget calls for a tax increase to pay for hurricane recovery on the Gulf Coast. However, the legislators from North Dakota are fighting it pretty hard. Their constituents don't like the idea of having to pay more taxes for problems that they don't face. They're willing to vote for it, though, if they can secure additional wildlife funding, which would have to be taken from California. California doesn't like this, so in return they want.... It would be like this on a much larger scale. "Americans" paying extra taxes to help with "Japanese" tsunami recovery, "Uzbekistan" losing funding to "Argentina".... The countries may not exist, but the parts of the world are still there. And sadly, many people don't really care about people 12,000 miles away that they'll never meet. It doesn't help that even without countries, culture will still exist. Things are different in different parts of the world. I myself recently moved from Wisconsin to California for work; as a child in the Midwest, we had tornado drills on a regular basis, but I realized on moving that I have no idea what to do in case of an earthquake. And that's only within the same country. Subsidies on corn work great for Nebraska and Iowa, but aren't so helpful for the rice farmers in Southeast Asia. The fact of the matter is that when it comes to governing, one size does not fit all. The world is too big for one government to be able to govern effectively. In order to be effective, it would have to basically do what the US has done, and have smaller governments that work under the bigger government -- take a certain area and say that governmentally it is distinct from a different area. But at that point, we might as well call those sub-governments "countries" and be done with it. 

I'm currently working on a story treatment for a monster story. The story is sort of a love letter to many different genres and classic tropes employed and made famous by, John Carpenter, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, and George Romero. With a heavy dose of Ishiro Honda's early work with Tokusatsu films, such as the original Godzilla. I'll try to do a quick rundown that will hopefully shed light on the main antagonist of the story, The Magdalene. The creature is a large amphibious monster that can best be described as a 150 foot long Salamander who's body seems to be composed entirely of horrific cancerous tumors, and suffering from a full body bruise, as its skin is sickly and black looking. The creature started out as a collection of micro organisms made from cancer cells, and originally conceived by a multinational research project in hopes of creating a cure for cancer. How this works is simple...sort of. 

DNA is fundamentally a discrete structure (a finite sequence built from a finite alphabet), so at a genetic level, all traits are discrete. However, there may be so many genes involved that there are many, many possible phenotypes, making the trait appear continuous. Also environmental factors like nutrition and sun exposure may play a role in traits such as height and skin color. But at the enzymatic level, all traits are discrete, and since inherent magic probably falls outside the realm of environmental effects, I'm going to assume that having a particularly magic type has a direct correspondence to enzyme activity. The tricky part is coming up with a set of enzymes and enzyme variants with exactly 6 phenotypes. The biggest obstacle to overcome is avoiding the effect of codominance. Perhaps the most obvious solution is to have a single gene with 6 alleles--but remember that humans are diploid and thus, everyone has two copies of every gene. Since every allele corresponds directly a magic type, and every person has two alleles, we wind up with 21 total phenotypes. We can get around this in a couple of ways. We could put the gene on the X chromosome. Males have only one copy and females only express one copy. But this has the effect that males always inherit their magic type from their mother, while females could wind up with either their mother's or their father's type with about equal likelihood. Alternatively, we could reduce the number of alleles to 3, which would result in 6 phenotypes. Each magic type is now the result of the combination of two alleles. For example: 

Yes they could. It is true that they wouldn't know how cars, traffic lights, etc work. However, it seems likely that they would realize "I probably shouldn't walk out in front of the big things that are moving really fast". Then other people who know how traffic lights work would start walking when the lights change, so they would learn to follow what other people are doing. Given time, they might figure out what the rules are, but if nothing else they could survive by following the crowd's behavior. Police likely wouldn't arrest them unless they try to do something they shouldn't. They'll probably be rather unclean, wearing clothes that have seen better days... Basically, they'll look like any random homeless person. So unless they do something blatantly illegal (and the moral code hasn't really changed THAT much - no stealing, no killing, etc etc) they'll probably be more or less ignored by the police. So the question then, is how can they get food and water, and get back to the Chinatown dumpster at the right time, when they have no money and don't speak the language. Churches. They're a scholar from the 15th Century, so that means that they're probably from a religious background. They'll recognize a church, especially a bigger cathedral like St. Patrick's. If they find a church, they're set. They can get food, water, shelter, and, most importantly, help with getting back to where they need to be. See, they can communicate with a preacher. They have a built-in translator: the Bible. There are Greek and Latin translations of the New Testament all over, and those will be (essentially) the same that they're used to (the languages haven't changed much). So if nothing else, they can communicate by pointing at words that the preacher can translate. Also, knowing Latin makes it really easy to fake communication in any of the Romance languages - French, Spanish, Italian. Coupled with their knowledge of (15th Century) French, communication shouldn't be too much of a problem once they can get a dialogue started. The trick, of course, is that there are a LOT of new branches of Christianity that they won't know about; Martin Luther wasn't born until 1483, so the Reformation hadn't happened yet. Our protagonist won't know about the existence of Lutheran, Presbyterian, etc, and will therefore be in for some shock unless they happen to find a Catholic church - though they've just moved forward 500 years, so there's going to be culture shock anyway. So long story short, unless they get hit by a bus or something before they figure out not to walk in the roads, I think they should be able to survive. 

The Greek Gods were more than humans with an immortality gene: they could shape shift, control nature, and generally do "supernatural" things like give birth from their skulls after swallowing the mother. So I don't think it's realistic to attribute their immortality to a gene, or even to any kind of biology; they're clearly made of "god stuff" beyond the ken of modern science. Indeed, for a god even to impregnate a human woman, he must first change his shape to appear human. If a human were to merely look upon a god in their true form, the human would be destroyed. So the children of gods are mortal simply because in order for a god to impregnate a human woman, he must first adopt a human visage and take human form. Then, the child grows in a human womb where they are nourished by human blood and earthly nutrients. Their body is built from human proteins, not "god stuff." This of course assumes that the the father is the god and the mother is an Earth woman. If the sexual roles were flipped, the child might very well end up being immortal! Assuming that earthly sperm would even have any effect on a godly ovum. 

Honestly, I don't think it would be all that different than this reality. The Hindenburg Disaster happened in 1937. World War Two started two years later. War often leads to technological innovation as each side tries to get the edge on their opponents, and World War Two saw amazing leaps in jet engine technology. The first flight by an airplane powered solely by jet engines took place on August 27, 1939. By the 1950s, almost all combat aircraft had moved from propellers to jet engines. The question, then, boils down to "Would civilian aircraft make the transition from airship to airplane?". In all likelihood, yes. The Hindenburg's class of ships had a top speed of 81 miles per hour. A Boeing 747 has a top speed of 614 miles per hour. It's a much faster way to travel. Jet planes might have taken a bit longer to catch on so fully in the civilian sector if the airship era hadn't ended so suddenly, but it would have happened soon enough due to its efficiency. 

First the Magdalene are injected directly into the patients body. The Magdalene will then congregate on the cancerous region and began to devour the cancerous cells, and then die shortly after. 

The problem is Magdalene batch #001 is ineffective in long term treatment, as they tend to die too quickly to successfully kill the cancer, batch #002 was developed to be longer living and more aggressive and was created using the rare mutated cancer cells of the main researchers deceased former colleague, and wife. Her last wish was for her body be used for scientific research that may one day make the world a better place. This new Magdalene variant was hyper aggressive and was designed with a genetic kill switch that would activate in case the organisms ate more than what was intended. However over time batch #002 evolved and mutated, figuring out a way around the kill switch, leading to them going out of control, multiplying and absorbing bio matter at a ravenous rate. Now that we know exactly what they are, lets break down their life cycle and how this colony eventually evolves into the larger forms.
