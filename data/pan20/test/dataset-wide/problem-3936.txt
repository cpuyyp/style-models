The original proof of Van der Waerden's theorem on monochromatic arithmetic progressions comes to mind. Well, the more recent ones too by the way. 

In research, one should not believe too strongly one way or the other. Trying to construct a counterexample, and trying to prove that there aren't any, are two ways of working with the same problem. One should try both ways instead of choosing. If you fail to prove a theorem, you might still obtain some constraints on a potential counterexample, thereby narrowing down the search. Conversely, if you fail to find a counterexample, you might get some hints to why there aren't any. 

If ${n \choose k} < 2^{k(k-1)/2-1}$, then there exists a 2-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on $n$ vertices with no monochromatic $k$-clique. Proof: Color randomly and the expected number of monochromatic $k$-cliques is smaller than 1. 

The integral essentially asks for the probability that, for $n$ independent "events" uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$, at least one happens after $c_n$, at least two happen after $c_{n-1}$, etc (thinking of the unit interval as time). Let $P_n(c_1,\dots,c_n) = n!\cdot J$ denote this probability (the integral $J$ also requires the $n$ events to occur in a specified order). If we condition on the number $k$ of events in the interval $[c_n,1]$, then the remaining events will be uniformly distributed in $[0,c_n]$, and we can write $P_n$ as $$P_n(c_1,\dots,c_n) = Pr(k=1)\cdot P_{n-1}\left(\frac{c_1}{c_n},\dots,\frac{c_{n-1}}{c_n}\right) + Pr(k=2)\cdot P_{n-2}\left(\frac{c_1}{c_n},\dots,\frac{c_{n-2}}{c_n}\right)+\dots.$$ To complete a recursive computation, we only need to compute the $O(n^2)$ integrals of the form $$P_i\left(\frac{c_1}{c_j},\dots,\frac{c_i}{c_j}\right)$$ for $1\leq i < j\leq n$. I'm not an expert on the complexity of rational arithmetic, but it seems to me that this should be doable in polynomial time. EDIT: Just for completeness, yes, the integral can be evaluated in $O(n^2)$ arithmetical operations, but so can $2^{2^n}$ (in fact in a linear number of operations), and that doesn't mean we can output (let alone compute) the digits in polynomial time. Even if the problem is to check an identity (so that the potential answer has to be part of the input), I don't see a general reason why that should be possible in polynomial time just because the number of arithmetical operations is polynomial (but people must have thought of that before, feel free to comment). In this case however, the integral $P_n(c_1,\dots,c_n)$ is a degree $n$ polynomial in $c_1,\dots,c_n$, with coefficients that grow "only" exponentially. It follows that all the denominators (and numerators) of the partial results will have size (number of digits) polynomial in the size of the input. 

Update on the background of the problem: The multiple integral in question is related to the last-arrival problem: A selector wants to pick, online, the last of an unknown number of items that arrive at independent times uniformly chosen in $[0,1]$. The number $w_n$ is the probability of success (with $n$ items) for the strategy where the selector accepts the $k$:th item if it arrives after time $1-1/(k+1)$. The last-arrival problem was a byproduct of an attempt to improve a lower bound by John Preater for the so-called partially ordered secretary problem. I have described how I came up with it in my arXiv paper ``When only the last one will do'', $URL$ The initial conjecture was that there exist policies with winning probability at least $1/e$ for every $n$, but this turned out not to be true (together with Ragnar Freij, we later got the bound in the partially ordered secretary problem up to the optimal $1/e$ by another method, see $URL$ or Elect. Comm. in Probab. 15 (2010), 504--507). At a conference in 2008 I went out for a beer with Thomas Bruss, and we came to discuss various problems of optimal stopping. I mentioned the last-arrival problem, and his initial thought was that his odds-theorem should give the answer. As it turns out, the conditions for the odds-theorem are slightly violated, but it still suggests a reasonably good strategy for the selector, namely the one just described, to accept the $k$:th item after time $1-1/(k+1)$. When I visited Bruss in 2009, the iterated integral in the OP was on the blackboard in the coffee room. Before I left I think I showed him a set of coffee-stained pages of notes that I claimed was a proof that $w_n$ is increasing for $n\geq 3$, but I certainly can't blame him for not remembering this. I might have said only that $w_n\geq 5/16$ for all $n$, which seemed to me to be the most interesting part of it. Edit: Looking back at some of our email correspondence, it seems I promised to send a proof, and never did. Now to those messy details. I have to apologize to everyone who expected a neat way to peal off one integral sign from the expression for $w_n$. What I have is simply some upper and lower bounds on $w_n$ that eventually prove the sequence to be increasing. It turns out that $w_n$ is asymptotically $1/e - constant\cdot n^{-1}$, and that consequently the difference $w_{n+1}-w_n$ is of order $1/n^2$. To prove the sequence to be increasing, we therefore need to estimate $w_n$ with an error smaller than that. In order for the selector to succeed, there has to be exactly one item arriving in the interval $[1-1/(n+1), 1]$. Moreover, there can be no item arriving in the interval $[1-1/n, 1-1/(n+1)]$, and at most one in the interval $[1-1/(n-1), 1-1/n]$, since otherwise an earlier item will be accepted. Let's call this the Main Condition. The probability that the main condition is satisfied is $$U(n) = n\cdot \frac1{n+1}\cdot \left[\left(1-\frac1{n-1}\right)^{n-1} + \frac1n\cdot \left(1-\frac1{n-1}\right)^{n-2}\right].$$ Explanation: There are $n$ ways to choose the item to be accepted, and that item has to be in the interval $[1-1/(n+1), 1]$ of length $1/(n+1)$. This gives the factor $n/(n+1)$. For the remaining $n-1$ items there are two possibilities, either they are all in the interval $[0, 1-1/(n-1)]$, which gives the first term within brackets, or one of them is in the interval $[1/(n-1), 1/n]$ of length $1/(n(n-1))$ and the remaining ones are in $[0, 1-1/(n-1)]$. In the latter case there are $n-1$ ways of choosing the special item, and after canceling a factor $n-1$ we get the second term within brackets. We have $w_n \leq U(n)$, and we would like to estimate the error $E(n) = U(n) - w_n$ in this approximation. By the way, Taylor expansion of $U(n)$ with respect to $1/n$ shows that $$U(n) = \frac1e - \frac1{2e}\cdot\frac1n + \frac7{24e}\cdot\frac1{n^2}+O\left(\frac1{n^3}\right),$$ so provided the error $E(n)$ is of order $1/n^3$, things look promising. If the main condition is met and the policy still fails, there must be some $k\geq 3$ for which exactly (!) $k$ items arrive in the interval $[1-1/(n-k+1), 1-1/(n+1)]$. An upper bound on the error is therefore $$E(n) \leq \sum_{k=3}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k}\left(\frac1{n-k+1}-\frac1{n+1}\right)^k = \sum_{k=3}^{n-1} \binom{n}{k}\left(\frac{k}{(n-k+1)(n+1)}\right)^k.$$ At this point it is easy to verify by computer that $w_n$ is increasing for $27\leq n \leq 200$, say. And for $3\leq n \leq 27$, it can be verified by exact integration (indeed up to at least $n=100$, as has been pointed out in earlier comments). To get an estimate that can be handled for large $n$, we treat the term $k=n-1$ individually, and for the remaining ones we use the elementary inequality $k^k/k! \leq e^{k-1}$. It follows that $$E(n) \leq \frac{n}{2^{n-1}} + \sum_{k=3}^{n-2} n^k e^{k-1}\left(\frac1{(n-k+1)(n+1)}\right)^k$$ $$ \leq \frac{n}{2^{n-1}} + e^{-1}\sum_{k=3}^{n-2} \left(\frac{e}{n-k+1}\right)^k.$$ In the last sum, the second derivative of the summand with respect to $k$ is $$ \left(\frac{e}{n-k+1}\right)^k \cdot \left[\left(\log\left(\frac{e}{n-k+1}\right) + \frac{k}{n-k+1}\right)^2 + \frac{2}{n-k+1}+\frac{k}{(n-k+1)^2}\right],$$ which is clearly nonnegative. Hence the summand is convex, so that in any sequence of consecutive terms, the first or the last must be maximal. Now we pick out also the term $k=3$, and notice that for $n\geq 169$, the term $k=4$ will be larger than the term $k=n-2$. Therefore $$E(n) \leq \frac{n}{2^{n-1}} + \frac{e^2}{(n-2)^3} + (n-5) \cdot \frac{e^3}{(n-3)^4} \leq \frac{n}{2^{n-1}} + \frac{e^2+e^3}{(n-3)^3} \leq \frac{30}{n^3},$$ if $n\geq 169$, as we already assumed. So we have $$U(n) - \frac{30}{n^3} \leq w_n \leq U(n).$$ At this point we can verify numerically that $U(n) - U(n-1) > 30/n^3$ for $164\leq n \leq 2000$, say, after which a very rough bound will suffice. To get such a bound, we can differentiate $U(n)$ with respect to $n$ and get $$U'(n) = \frac{\left(1-\frac1{n-1}\right)^n}{(n+1)^2(n-2)^2}\cdot \left((n^4-n^3-2n^2+n+1)\log\left(1-\frac1{n-1}\right) + n^3+n^2-2n\right).$$ By Taylor's theorem, $$\log(1-x) \geq -x - \frac89\cdot x^2$$ whenever $0\leq x \leq 1/4$. Also, $$\left(1-\frac1{n-1}\right)^n \geq \frac14,$$ for $n\geq 6$. Plugging in these estimates (with $x = 1/(n-1)$), we get $$U'(n) \geq \frac1{36}\cdot \frac{n^3-9n^2+25n-1}{(n-1)(n-2)^2(n+1)^2},$$ which is of order $1/n^2$, and is easily seen to be larger than $30/n^3$ for all $n\geq 2000$. It follows that $U(n) - U(n-1)\geq \int_{n-1}^n 30/x^3\,dx \geq 30/n^3\geq E(n)$, and that $w_n$ is increasing. 

Here is a construction that allowed me to verify with a few minutes of computer time that such cycles exist for all even $N \leq 10^{12}$. Let $G_n$ be the "prime-sum" graph with vertices labeled $1,\dots,n$ and edges connecting numbers that sum to a prime. First notice that if $N$ is even and there is a twin prime pair $N+2k-1$ and $N+2k+1$ with $2k<N$, then there is a path in $G_N$ from $2k-1$ to $2k$ that includes all larger numbers up to $N$ (just follow the edges that correspond to sums $N+2k-1$ and $N+2k+1$). So if there is a hamilton path in $G_{2k}$ from $2k-1$ to $2k$, then combining these two paths yields a hamilton cycle in $G_N$. It is relatively straightforward to construct inductively such hamilton paths for $2k<10^7$, again using twin primes. If $2k-1$ and $2k+1$ are prime, the edges of those two sums immediately yield the desired path (this would give Douglas Zare's construction). Otherwise let $2k+a-1, 2k+a+1$ be the next twin prime pair. The edges corresponding to these two sums will give a path from $2k-1$ to $2k$ leaving out only the numbers $1,\dots, a$. Assuming that we already obtained a hamilton path from $a-1$ to $a$ in $G_a$, we can now "glue" that path to the path from $2k-1$ to $2k$ by replacing an appropriate edge. Alternatively we can use the hamilton path from $a+1$ to $a+2$ in $G_{a+2}$ and "glue" with two suitably chosen edges. This means that whenever $N$ is even and there is a twin prime pair larger than $N$ and within distance $10^7$, there is a hamilton cycle in $G_N$. We can therefore check the existence of such hamilton cycles for $N\leq 10^{12}$ (and probably way larger) by finding a sequence of twin prime pairs with distances just below $10^7$, without performing any calculations for individual values of $N$. EDIT: A modification of this argument shows that there are infinitely many values of $N$ for which $G_N$ is hamiltonian. If $N+1$ and $N+2k+1$ are prime, we can use all edges with these two sums to obtain a collection of $k$ paths that start and end in $\{1,\dots, 2k\}$ so that for each path, the sum of the two endpoints is congruent to $N+1$ modulo $2k$. By the famous theorem of Zhang, Maynard, Tao and others (Polymath 8a, 8b) on bounded gaps between primes, there are infinitely many $N$ for which this holds with $2k\leq 246$. We can now check that for each $k\leq 123$ and each possible congruence class of $N$ modulo $2k$ (the even classes), these paths can be combined with $k$ more edges (matching $1, 3, 5,\dots, 2k-1$ to $2,4,6,\dots, 2k$) into a hamilton cycle. With only one exception, this completion can be obtained by taking either the edges that sum to $2k+1$ or the edges that sum to two primes of the form $p$ and $p+2k$. The only exception is when $2k=20$ and $N\equiv 6$ (mod 20). In that case the long paths will connect numbers in $\{1,\dots,20\}$ that sum to 7 or 27, and none of the three prime-pairs $(3, 23)$, $(11, 31)$ or $(17, 37)$ will connect them into a single cycle. But it is easy to find an ad-hoc solution to that single case.
