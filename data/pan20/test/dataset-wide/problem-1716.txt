I'm not going to lie, I've never ever ran Disk Cleanup on a server in 7 years of managing Windows based networks. Personally I'd either delete the files manually or just delete the local user profile. I assume this stuff isn't in their roaming profile, if applicable? I'd be far more concerned as to what has been going wrong to generate 3Gbs of error reporting! 

If you want to access the console, so that you're doing the equivalent of plugging a keyboard or mouse into the VM (Or using iLO / DRAC) then you must use the vSphere Client. That's just how it works on ESXi. Other than that, you treat the VM like any other machine and connect to it however you would if it were a physical machine. With Windows you'd need to use RDP, Linux SSH etc. 

"Replace all child permissions..." is a 'one off' task. What you may find is that one of the subfolders is not configured to "Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent" So, ensure your user group is configured to have "Full Control" over the top directory, and then in all subsequent directories ensure that "Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent" is checked. This can be found under "Advanced" while in the Folder Security tab. Although things have been moved round slightly in Server 2008, permissions work in the same way. 

You could use psexec from Sysinternals to remotely run the command "quser". This will list all logged in users, along with whether they're at the console or on RDP. That said, I don't think it should automatically take other sessions and I'm pretty certain you can have up to 2 as standard. 

If you perform a from the command prompt then you'll see a list of routes and their metrics. 0.0.0.0 denotes the Default Route, so if traffic is going through both NICs then I'd say you either: 1) Have a default gateway set on both NIC's - this is bad, so remove the DFGW from the second. 2) The other traffic which is going through NIC2 is on the same subnet as the NIC's IP. Windows would never route traffic on a different subnet through a NIC which is not on that subnet, or that doesn't have a gateway set (Or a static route) I'm not understanding your position well enough to offer you specific advice. Could you update your question with the IP configuration of both NIC's and what IP's need to go where. 

For core information like you're describing (With the exception of a Network Diagram) we use a single Excel workbook, and save this into a network folder with the customers name. While I can understand why people don't like this approach I find it works great because it's a single reference document that I can take with me to site, e-mail around and update quickly. My biggest complaint would be lack of version control, but I've yet to find anything that works well without making life hard work. To counter your "I'm shooting for a process that's more portable, secure and elegant than a simple spreadsheet": More Portable: What can be more portable than a 500 Kilobyte Spreadsheet? I'd be scared of using anything cloud or webbased because internet connectivity can't be guaranteed. Secure: This one I'll give you and I too would like solutions on making our solution safer. Elegant: We spent time creating a nice template for our workbook. Like I say, this is a multi-sheet workbook, not just a huge page of scattered information. I think most IT documentation fits nicely into a tabular form and a spreadsheet keeps this very neat and simple. While I have lots of issues with how we record and store build documentation, I really can't find fault in a solid, well formated spreadsheet. I'll also add that we work with some big IT Services companies and they work in much the same way. Again, it's brilliant - I turn up to site, request the documentation and get a single neat spreadsheet that I can use for the duration. 

Load up CPanel Go to "Set Default Address" I think the options you require are in there. If not, can you be more specific about what you're trying to do? This feature is sometimes disabled by your hosting provider, so you may need to request it be enabled. 

Unless I'm misunderstanding you, you just need to use Host Headers on your IIS server. These work kind of like Virtual Hosts in Apache - there's no requirement for anything* inbetween the server and the internet unless you want to expand to multiple IIS servers. Here is an IIS7 how to page which will get you started: $URL$ *You still need a firewall, etc, but it doesn't have to do anything for this to work 

Is your Windows 7 machine configured to use your ADDS server as its DNS server? If so, can you ping the domain name? What I mean by this is, if the server is called MyDC.MyDomain.Com Then can you ping / resolve 

Which also disables the "Properties" button, but occasionally customers ask for this to be left enabled. So, is there a way to do both? 

Why would want to implement the complexity of passing it through. Just configure a datastore and present a VMDK or RDM only to your FTP/SAMBA server. This gives you may more flexibility and will be far more supportable. That said, by doing this anyway, you're losing a lot of the benefits of virtualisation unless you're going to implement some kind of replication system. 

I'd be looking at long folders / file names rather than corruption as such. You may try resetting permissions, too. Alternatively, back up her My Docs. Delete the files, check redirection works and manually copy to the redirected folder. These steps may also highlight the original issue. 

This is a core issue with your solution. The above policy is a machine wide configuration - it can not be applied on a per user basis. You can either configure a Terminal Server with this configured, or not. There's no in-between with the policy you've chosen. Secondly, the first policy (The Loopback Stuff and the vbs script) should be two separate policies. The first should ONLY contain the computer configuration stuff and should, ideally, be applied to "Authenticated Users" or, at the very least, the Terminal Server accounts/groups. The second policy will be your User Configuration settings, and should only apply to the users who you want to have that printer. 

As @jscott kindly points out below - a great alternative to custom ADM's is to use Group Policy Preference Registry settings. Ticking the "Remove this item when it is no longer applied" solves the tattooing issue. They're not so portable or distributable, but they're highly transparent and easy to use. Plus, if you copy a GPP (Or a group of them, whatever) using the GUI, you can past the results to a text file. It's all XML, and you can simply paste them again in future by copying the text and pasting in the GUI. 

You could try GETTSCIP from $URL$ It's a freeware application, but I don't know if it will work for disconnected sessions. I doubt if it will, though. 

Open up a GPO in the editor as normal Expand either "Computer Configuration" or "User Configuration" depending on your desired result Expand "Preferences" Expand "Control Panel Settings" Select "Local Users and Groups" Right click near "There are no items to show..." and select New -> Local Group 

Personally, I've never seen a use case for the Guest account. There's nothing inherently wrong with having generic users* for your organisation, but I think you should be creating specific users, groups and policies for these. *I'm assuming you have a particular use case for allowing members of the public to log in 

Good ones - no. Bad ones - sometimes, but that's only because they're badly engineered. That's really all there is to it, really - if a switch requires regular rebooting then it's either faulty, or just a very poor switch. That said, as with all things with IT - sometimes things do go wrong. If it's the first time it's happened, keep an eye on it but don't worry too much. I've seen it more often with consumer routers (Especially ones doing NAT) that are being used in the wrong environment. In those cases, it's more likely to be the NAT table filling up or perhaps a CPU related issues which are really down to just misusing the equipment. It's plausible that you have a consumer switch which is just being pushed too hard. 

Add the servers to a different OU and apply a different subset of policies. You could also change the permissions for your folder redirection GPO. There are other ways, and the 'best' will depend on the current architecture of your Group Policy but the essential answer is to use Group Policy as intended and apply different ones to this server! 

The volume licensed editions of Microsoft Office, at least, allow you to create an MSP to do unattended installs. You can then roll this out using the software delivery mechanism of your choice - Group Policy, SCCM, Altiris etc. 

There's only one best practice solution here: you need an additional Domain Controller with the Active Directory DNS service installed. You should then configure a forwarder within DNS to use whatever your preferred provider is. You then have full full redunancy for Active Directory and DNS. You should then configure your clients (Through DHCP ideally) to use one as the primary and one as the secondary. 

Do you mean using Citrix XenApp to publish the RDP Client? If so, then yes, there are a couple of reasonable reasons you may wish to do this: 

It's a little unclear what you're trying to achieve and why, but I think batch scripting is the wrong tool for the job (Especially in 2013). Powershell will give you far more predictable results and allow you provide far better reliability, for example:
