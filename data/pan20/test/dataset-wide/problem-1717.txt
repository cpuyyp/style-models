i have a cisco asa5520 in transparent mode. the interface is on the same subnet as some windows machines, which are generating a lot of broadcast traffic that is filling up the logs. is there any way to have it not log that its blocking those packets? its a bunch of these messages: "through-the-device packet to from management-only network is denied: udp src..." im also seeing some of those zeroconf requests that id like to drop logging for. i tried to just put a rule on the management interface, but apparently thats not allowed. it looks like turning the syslog filter up to error might solve both issues, but will i be missing any potentially life saving messages by ignoring the info bits? 

We have a server 2008 r2 box with a 60gb c:\ partition that over time completely fills up. The culprit appears to be winsxs, which is a well documented issue without any resolution beyond microsoft jamming their fingers in their ears and repeating 'its not a real issue'. This is all accurate from an extremely narrow viewpoint, however explorer, symantec liveupdate, wsus, and a host of other applications that live on this machine disagree and refuse to operate properly. Ive seen where people are displeased because winsxs takes a few more gig than it should, however this has literally filled the entire disk. Is this an artifact of wsus, or some other crazy behavior? Anyone know anything i can do to stop (and hopefully reverse) this usage? The other machine we have running 2k8r2 is doing just fine, so its not a general OS issue, that i can tell. 

Found it - in syslog setup theres a list of syslog IDs. for this particular alert the ID number is 418001. open that, click suppress, no more message in the log! 

im a bit fuzzy on this, as its been a while and i dont have the server in question in front of me, but i think i had a similar problem. we had a sharepoint services site that absolutely would not back up at all no matter what i did - until i created a share with write access for the guest user (i think). this is really a terrible answer, and ill update it later with more detail. UPDATE: mine is also implemented using stsadmin, per a commenter above. i did not enumerate any specific sites or hosts other than the machine that is hosting sharepoint itself. 

one of my DCs is missing a single GPO object - all others are there and appear to be the correct version. there are no errors related to DFS or FRS in event viewer that i can find. the server in question is 2008, although there are both 2003 and 2008 DCs in this domain. repadmin shows no errors that i can find. update: ok so now its looking more like GPOs created on a specific server (one of the 2008 boxes) arent syncing out to the others. i thought i had seen this GPO on other servers, but its not there now. dcdiag and repadmin show no errors besides the userenv GPO processing errors still, but userenv is complaining all over the logs on multiple machines update2: solved - this machine was out of sync and wasnt syncing using frs at all - these errors werent showing up in eventvwr for some reason. performed scandisks on both drives at startup, and it started logging ntfrs error 13552, 13555. was able to rebuild using BURFLAG registry key. 

Does there exist a router that supports multiple GRE connections over NAT? Im currently running pfSense, and it only supports 1 at a time. I understand why, its just a drag as there are multiple people in this office trying connect to the same VPN server. Obviously there are other ways to solve this, like different VPN setups, multiple interfaces, etc, but for a variety of reasons Id much prefer multiple GRE connections. 

Given the windows PCL separator page with escape character '\' (without quotes), how would i set an arbitrary line to red, and then the next line back to black? heres the file so far: \ \H1B\L%-12345x@PJL ENTER LANGUAGE=PCL \U\L \H1B\L&l1T\0 \M\B\S\N\U \U\LJob : \I \U\LDate: \D \U\LTime: \T \U\L \U\L Please be sure to take only your documents \U\L \E ive been asked to make the please be sure part red 

How does a routing and remote access server pick up routes to advertise to clients, and where can a list of routes being provided be reviewed? One of our users is reporting that the server is advertising a route which is valid, but has never been entered in the static routes section of the RRAS server, or told/provided to them at any time. In fact the static route section is currently empty. RIP is not configured at this time, so its not coming from there that I can tell. we are using PPTP, not l2tp. 

Its like insurance - if its more likely to happen (ie break more often from a complicated set of moving parts), going to cost a lot to fix (replacement or sending a tech out, again lots of parts requires lots of training), and has a relatively high likelihood of being used in the event it is necessary (enterprises dont just let their backup systems fall apart and not worry about it), its going to cost more. 

im hesitant to try bringing up another duplicate site (a best practice i read in a sharepoint book) to support both integrated and basic, but i dont fully understand how sharepoint works, and im loathe to break it again. additionally, since i cant make the one we have work the way i want, im skeptical ill be able to do so for an additional site. anyone have any magic that might help me out of this? edited to include the error below: Error: Connector:Unspecified HTTP error.

high inode usage typically indicates lots of small files (or perhaps filesystem corruption). if you run out of inodes, you will not be able to create additional files and so the disk will be 'full' regardless of its actual available capacity in MB/GB/TB 

When using mod_security (installed from EPEL) with apache 2 on a centos box, sometimes users are unable to send messages - im having trouble tracing the rule back, the only place i get to is 'inbound anomaly score too high' anyone know what i should be looking for, how to trace mod_security stuff, or better yet specifically what OWA in 2003 is doing that it doesnt like? 

Active directory is essentially a closely tied implementation of LDAP and Kerberos by microsoft, along with some customized tools and additional 'functionality' built on top. So it would be correct to say that kerberos is PART of a windows domain, but not that kerberos is equivalent to a windows domain. 

can anyone recommend (or recommend to avoid) a source for asset labels? id like foil, potentially with a color logo if possible. so if youve had something like that printed before, please speak up. google returns far too many results to be manageable. 

In similar situations ive reinstalled the application and then uninstalled it. Unless something really heinous happened during the original setup, like someone manually editing install paths or something, the uninstaller should take care of everything thats already there on its own. 

On a windows 2k8R2 DC box the eventlog service wont start. When i try to start the service the machine returns: "Windows could not start the Windows Event Log service on Local Computer. Error 13: The data is invalid." event viewer wont open either. obviously, i dont have an event log for this error. ive already tried clearing the event logs. that didnt do anything. the other DC isnt experiencing this issue. 

whats your source for scsi/sas disks - to replace breakage or expand existing systems? the usual suspects (newegg, pricewatch, ZZF) seem to have limited selection. 

Ive been looking at monitoring for a while. My org didnt have any before i came other than 'whered my yahoo go'. It appears that most packages out there focus on negative monitoring (ie, this service/host was up and now its not). This seems like a valid first step, but what can you look at past that for positive monitoring (ie that port wasnt up, and now it is, or hey look thats a new DHCP host)? I suppose its possible to have a declaration for every single port/network address in nagios, but that seems cumbersome. Does anyone know of a better tool for monitoring ports/hosts for affirmatively down? 

Appears to be not possible (at least with current implementation). You can bring up the console and do it manually if its really necessary though. 

It is worthwhile to note that with LC connectors, it is difficult to change the fiber pairs from crossover to straight through. SC is easier, and ST is obviously trivial. 

why not use apache/lighttpd as a proxy/caching server and php interpreter at the same time? lighttpd as caching proxy: $URL$ apache as caching proxy: $URL$ 

When attempting to change ISOs on a powered on guest instance, set-cddrive is returning an error but completing the command. A couple different commands produce the same result: 

Have you checked to make sure there arent any PAM errors? just because it works from putty doesnt mean authentication isnt the problem. 

Environment: Single exchange 2003 box, running on server 2k3. latest service packs applied. all but latest round of patches applied. Symptom: A single user cannot view any meeting invite via IMAP/OWA. Works fine in outlook, but its a users who primarily uses linux, so thats not an option. They get HTTP 500 responses for every calendar invite they have. Tried in Firefox/Chrome/IE (7 on xp). This isnt new, its just being reported for the first time. Nobody else is reporting the issue. Ive certainly seen this here and there with corrupt invites, but not every invite in a mailbox. Edit 2 (more detail): Its actually just updates & cancellations the error is occurring on. Also, updates and cancellations do not appear when the user connects via IMAP.
