To address your actual questions: "Don't all activities produce externalities"? Yes, but many of these externalities are priced. For example, if I buy an apple then you can no longer consume that apple, which is an externality. However, this does not result in a market failure because the price mechanism in a competitive market ensures that I get an apple and you don't only if I am willing to pay more for that apple than you are. So the apples go to the people who value them the most, which is the efficient thing to do. Since we are doing the efficient thing, there is no market failure. So, when should we worry about externalities? We should check whether the net effects can cancel each other out. For example, suppose that the private benefit of some action was lower than the social benefit, but that the private cost was also lower than the social cost by exactly the same amount. Then the net effect would be that MPB=MPC at exactly the same quantity where MSB=MSC. The private individual would then take the socially optimal action and there would be no market failure. A market failure only occurs if the externality is such that MPB=MPC at a quantity different to that where MSB=MSC. Only then will the behaviour of the private individual (whose optimal action is to equalise private marginal benefit and private marginal cost) differ from that which is socially optimal. 

Should be no difference. You are either (1) buying USD by selling CAD or (2) selling CAD to buy USD. 

Since the seasons are swapped between the northern and southern hemispheres, Chilean farms can produce fruits and vegetables to sell to the Americans in the middle of winter. If you live in the States, go to a local supermarket in the middle of winter and look at the fruits. Some of them (for me, I see grapes) are from Chile. Chile also exports fish. It has the longest coastline in the world, and has had some success in fish farming; both of these factors help Chile sell a lot of fish. This is just part of why Chile has been successful (I haven't even mentioned government policy!) but hopefully it'll give you some background on why Chile has been more of a success story than other Latin American nations.

Producer surplus is calculated using the S(pre-subsidy) and the demand curve. You're probably confused because you think the surplus should be calculated using the new supply curve. However, the producer is actually still producing on the original supply curve. 

Stocks/shares are equity (a share is 'a part of' something) and are thus essential to ownership of a company. Owning shares means that you own part nof a company. The ownership, as a side effect, gives voting rights on the C-suite and dividends. Acquiring a company requires you to buy all of the shares of that company (so that you own it). 

A company will typically employ an investment bank to act as an underwriter when it wishes to issue new stock. The investment bank essentially agrees to buy the issued stocks from the issuing company and its job is then to sell them to investors. Investment banks employ a sales force who try to persuade large investors (such as pension funds) to commit to buy the stocks before the date of issue. If the investment bank does a good job then all of the issued stocks will be allocated to a buyer in advance. If the investment bank fails to fails to find enough buyers then it is stuck with the unsold stock and must try to sell them to the public in the stock market. 

the long-run profit from the safe option (e.g. diversification) can be greater over the lifetime of the firm. In this example, the safe option maximises lifetime profit when (a) the probability of risky option leading to bankruptcy (and hence the loss of all future profit) is high or (b) the firm values the future highly relative to the present. 

The $y$ value in this figure tells us the probability that a given individual's willingness to pledge (WTP) is no greater than the dollar value on the $x$ axis. By turning this upside down, we get the probability that somone is willing to pay at least this much: 

Debt is not exactly free money. It is 'free' money (apart from interest) only if you can be depended on to pay back that debt. In other words, investors are willing to lend money to a government if they are sure that the government will pay them back. Failing to pay back your debt would require your country to declare bankruptcy (or drop out of the global financial system altogether). The reason why governments like the U.S. can keep borrowing money is because investors believe that the U.S. can easily make enough money to pay them back in the future. This is based on the debt to GDP ratio. If your debt to GDP ratio is too high (say, 10 to 1) that means it might be quite difficult for the country to pay back all that debt. The current U.S. debt to GDP ratio is between 0.7 and 1.0, which is relatively high (a result of the Great Recession). Another smaller country might not be able to easily borrow with such a high debt to GDP ratio, but the U.S. also has credibility - it has not defaulted on its debts before, unlike some other sovereign states (Argentina). Combined with the fact that the U.S. has large financial clout and is relatively important, investors feel that the U.S. government is unlikely to default on its debts. If the U.S. government were to keep on borrowing money, eventually people would get a little concerned with the amount of debt it has taken on. It's possible to think of sovereign debt in a similar way to personal (your) debt. For example, if you own a credit card, you can use that credit card to get 'free' money and use that money to purchase things. The reason why banks are willing to lend you this money is because you have previously paid them back. If you were to (1) ask for a lot more money than you make (e.x. $100 million) or (2) ask for money after failing to pay the bank back at the end of the month, the bank would reject you. Investors, like the bank, require governments (and individuals like you) to meet some requirements before they are willing to lend you money. 

Remember that I said the change in $p$ was tiny? If this change is almost zero then the number of extra units demanded will also be small and we can get an exact value for the consumer's willingness to pay for these units: $p\approx \text{WTP}\approx p'$. So the willingness to pay for the marginal unit is just the price. But the price is also the height of the demand curve!$^†$ Note that if I had started with a different price and performed the same exercise then I could have calculated the willingness to pay for a different unit of the good. So the height of the demand curve at a given point measures the consumer's willingness to pay for the unit of the good below that point. Lastly, how much should the consumer be willing to pay for a unit? The answer is that he should be willing to pay as much utility as that unit gives him (a.k.a. the marginal utility). Thus, the demand curve's height measures willingness to pay, which is just another way of saying it measures marginal utility. $^†$ Note that the distance $PQ$ in your figure is just the height of the demand curve too. 

To the best of my knowledge - and I'm not an accountant, so I may very well be wrong: buybacks are not profits, but are instead considered as an 'investment' in Apple in its own company. Since they are not profits, they are not taxed. Apple using its offshore cash to buy back its own stock is changing the accounting balance rather than actually generating any profits. Consider the following balance sheet: 

Look at P = 80. If you shift the aggregate demand curve over by 100, the AD curve will intersect the LRAS at P = 80 instead of P = 100. You need to shift it by 200. 

People on the highway are willing to pay more to stay on the highway (leaving to find another gas station will take time, they might not be familiar with the area, or other reasons). Since they're willing to pay more, the gas stations charge more. 

Lowering the price might increase the quantity of gas or petrol sold, but it might not increase the quantity enough relative to the decrease in price. For example, dropping the price by 10% might only increase the amount of gas sold by 5%. Your overall revenue would decrease. 

Since the profit that a monopolist makes from a unit is equal to difference between its price and its marginal cost, the monopolist will tend to set price above marginal cost. This results in a higher price (the green $p$) and a reduction in total welfare (given by the shaded area in this figure) and consumer surplus (the triangle between the price line and the demand curve): 

The literature on innovation deals with activities such as research and development that give rise to new products. A good reference is "Innovation and Incentives" by Scotchmer. 

More generally, it is possible for the slope of a firm's residual demand curve to differ from that of the market demand curve. It all depends on how consumers are allocated across the two firms. The relevant material on rationing rules can be found in Section 5.3 of Tirole's The Theory of Industrial Organization. 

Economics involves a lot of fairly easy calculus rather than a little very hard calculus. Primarily, this means calculation of simple derivatives and the occasional bit of integration. Doing economics is a great way to become good at calculus! You will get lots of exposure to simple calculus problems. That will give you lots of practice. Moreover, the problems will usually have a fairly concrete application and hopefully make calculus more interesting than trying to learn it from an abstract math book. From long personal experience as a student and teacher: it is easier to become good at things you love than it is to learn to love things you are good at.
