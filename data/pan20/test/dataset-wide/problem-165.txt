TLDR Comparing the magnetic field strength of a permanent magnet with that of a planet is naive. Such a comparison ignores the fact that magnetic fields dissipate with distance much as gravity does. If you compare their magnetic properties independent of distance, their magnetic moment in particular, you'll see that Earth's magnetic moment is 75 trillion times more powerful than industrial grade rare-earth magnets which simply outclasses permanent magnets entirely. Artificially generating a similar field for Mars requires similarly powerful engineering, or equally brilliant idea. Permanent Magnets Permanent magnets have a remanence (magnetic strength, $B_r$) of $0.2$ $T$ to $1.4$ $T$ depending on the composition. Ferrite magnets have a $B_r$ of $0.2$ $T$ - $0.4$ $T$ whereas sintered neodymium rare earth magnets have a $B_r$ of $1.0$ $T$ - $1.4$ $T$ [Wikipedia] Earth Earth's surface [magnetic field strength] ($B_s$) ranges from 25 to 65 microteslas ($25 \times 10^{-6}$ $T$ - $65 \times 10^{-6}$ $T$). Relating the Two Disclaimer: Please bear with me here. EM was not my strong suit. Your source suggests the usage of permanent magnets because, on face value, permanent magnets appear stronger than planetary magnetic fields. Using the above values, one would think that permanent magnets are 26,000 to 17,000x more powerful than Earth's magnetic field. The naivete of this notion is that it ignores that magnetic field strength decreases with distance. In fact it does so similarly to gravity: $B \propto {{1}\over{r^2}} $, $G \propto {{1}\over{r^2}} $. A better metric to compare the two 'magnets' would be to compare their magnetic moments. Magnetic moment is normally defined as a magnet's responsiveness to an external magnetic field; but, it's also used to define the magnet's magnetic field when it is known. Permanent Magnet's Magnetic Moment For permanent magnets, their magnetic moment is simply defined as: $\vec{m} = {{1}\over{\mu_0}} \vec{B_r} V$ where $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability constant, $\vec{B_r}$ is the remanence (magnetic field strength) of the permanent magnet, and $V$ is its volume. Suppose, we're working with an industrial grade neodymium bar, IMNB1074 to be precise. Given its dimensions of 0.5 in x0.06 in x 0.13 in and remanence of 13200 Gauss, it's magnetic moment is: $\vec{m} = {{1}\over{\mu_0}} \vec{B_r} V = (1.26\times10^{-6}) (1.48 T) (6.55\times 10^-5 m^3) = 77 Am^2 $ Earth's Magnetic Moment Since the magnetic field is generated by the geodynamo of the outer core, it may be simply modeled as a spinning shell of charge [Princeton]. Using the princeton paper cited, the magnetic field outside the shell (R>a) as a function of the magnetic moment is: $\vec{B_s}(r) = {{3(\vec m \cdot \vec r)\vec r - \vec m}\over{r^3}} $ Here we make a simplifying assumption by focusing entirely on the magnitude of the magnetic moment. You'll see why that's okay in a minute. First shift the $r^3$ term to the other side of the equation, and rewrite $\vec B$ as $\bar B \hat B$ (Magnitude times unit vector): $\bar B_s r^3 \hat B_s = {3(\vec m \cdot \vec r)\vec r - \vec m}$ and calculate that left hand side, using the average of the previously cited magnet field strengths of earth. $\bar B_s r^3 \hat B_s = {1 \over 2}(25 \times 10^{-6} T + 65 \times 10^{-6} T) (6,353,000 m)^3 \hat B= 1.15 \times 10^{16} Tm^3 \hat B$ This gives us the magnitude of Earth's magnetic moment. $1.15 \times 10^{16} \hat B = 3(\vec m \cdot \vec r)\vec r - \vec m$ This is 150 trillion times larger than that of an industrial grade neodymium magnet. Number of Neodymium magnets needed to simulate Earth's Magnetic Field For completeness, I'll try to answer this when I get home tonight (I'm at work atm); but, as I'm sure you can see, artificially simulating Earth's magnetic field require an astronomical number of magnets. 

You Don't You do absolutely nothing. Inmates are dropped off by automated landers and left to fend for themselves. If exportation of harvested resources are important automated landers pick them up or drop off tools and supplies necessary to gathering this resource. Enforce a quota. When quotas aren't met automated landers drop off hunter killer drones with quotas of their own to fulfill. unlike the inmates, the hunter killer drones ALWAYS fill their quotas.... The automated landers do not posses any more fuel or life support than is absolutely the bare minimum necessary to make it to the surface and drop off inmates, cargo dropoff or pickup landers have zero life support what so ever. The Landers don't posses even an ounce of extra fuel beyond what is required to land or boost to an unpowered orbit where they are picked up by a manned ship that comes by to collect the planet's quota every several months. That's a long time to float in space without power, food, or life support. In addition unless specifically dropping off prisoners the landers reenter and blast off at higher G's than can be survived by a living passenger. Any attempt to stow away is suicide. As long as the automated orbital security system is recording quotas are made then the inmates run their own affairs. The planet is given a deadline, if a century of quotas are met and the native born population reaches a certain point of stability, infrastructure development, and lawfulness the planet will be freed and allowed to join the rest of the intergalactic community. If quotas aren't met people die. Carrot and the stick. Someday freedom might be an option, which makes an excellent carrot, and if the population gets tired of chasing the carrot the hunter killer drones provide an excellent stick to beat them back into productivity again. Excellent way to harvest resources and colonize difficult planets with a minimum expense of manpower..... well... not anybody you particularly care about anyhow. 

Aligned center of mass with parent. Matched rotational spin (specifically the precessional angular speed of the ring to Earthâ€™s rotational angular speed). artificial gravity induced by centripetal acceleration. Stabilizers to prevent precession of the ring. Since the station is uniformly circular, its center of mass lies at the geometric center of the ring. Gravitational problems, when applied to uniform objects, simplify down to the gravitational forces acting upon the center of mass of each object. If the ring's center of mass aligns with the parent, then it will not experience a net gravitational pull from the parent. If, however, the the point is misaligned, then the ring will experience a gravitational force from the parent. Since the misaligned center of mass of the ring lies well outside of the ring, the entire ring will move as the center of mass orbits the parent's center of mass. This induces an external spin upon the station which introduces precession beyond what the stabilizers may have been designed for. 

For the same reasons why human exploration of space usually trumps robotic exploration. First of all, the belief or presumption that unmanned robotics are, and will always be, more efficient explorers of [place we wish to explore] is intrinsically flawed. This topic has been covered in academia [1], media [2, 3] with respect to Space, and many of the same reasons apply here. I grant that in many cases, robotic exploration is better; however, there are many reasons why human exploration may or will be preferred. Fundamentally it boils down to the long term goals and the available resources, and the long term ROI. For example, robotics is not always cheaper than human exploration. Here's quick list of broad (and paraphrased) reasons supporting human exploration over robotic exploration: 

A thicker atmosphere would make it easier for something filled with hydrogen gas to float. The floating plants are actually colonies of the same species with interlocking root mechanisms. The species grow in clusters in the deserts on the planet, the male plant species grows tough but lightweight fibrous root networks that fuse into the female member of the species, the female plants are giant cacti-like bladders that fill with hydrogen and methane produced as a byproduct of bacterial colonies inside the bladder like growths. As the storm season on the planet approaches the ground water content begins to dry up and the plants release their hold on the ground floating up into the sky in big colonies of males and females bound together by root systems. this is absorb as much water and sunlight in the clouds as possible while they are flowering and growing their seeding bodies. The males pollinate the females, then they grow tough spine covered seed pods. Ultimately the annual storm season begins and the lightning storms ignite the hydrogen inside the colonies to explode and toss these tough spiny seed pods over as wide an area as possible. The pods hit the ground and burst open scattering seeds everywhere, the storm season is when water is most plentiful giving the dispersed seeds the maximum chance to germinate. These plants actually take years and years to grow into a successful colony. They are otherwise just colonies of cacti in the desert unless the very specific conditions to begin the metamorphosis into a floating balloon colony exist they are land bound. 

Discussion: Lagrange Points. In astronomy and orbital mechanics, Lagrange points are positions in an orbital configuration where an object remains fixed relative to the other bodies. Point 3 automatically removes typical orbital positions such as Low-Earth-Orbit and Geosynchronous-Earth-Orbits. This leaves the Lagrange points as a natural selection; but, there are 4 such points for Earth and The Moon and 4 more for Earth and The Sun. Earth-Moon Lagrange Points If we look at the Earth-moon system, L1 is a natural point to choose for the station. It's situated between Earth and The Moon with relatively quick access to either body and can observe Earth's full rotation with ease. That being said, L1 poses 2 issues: 

L1 is a unstable point. If the satellite drifts a bit, it can fall out of L1 and towards the Earth or Moon in an unstable elliptical orbit. Unfortunately this applies to all Lagrange points, but unequally. Depending on your SciFi scenario, this may not be an issue assuming the station has basic thrust capacity to keep it within the Lagrange point. L1 is strongly coupled with the Moon's 27 day orbit. As a direct result, from the station's POV, in 24 hours it'll move 13.3 degrees around Earth while Earth would've rotated a full 360 degrees. As far the station is concerned though, it'll observe Earth rotate 360-13.3 degrees or 346 degrees. This means that if the prime meridian were directly below the station, after 24 station hours, the 13th longitude would be beneath it, and after 48 hours the 26th longitude, and so on... For comparison this would place Greenwich at 00:00, ~Naples, Italy at 24:00, Bucharest, Romania at 48:00 and Mecca, Saudi Arabia at 72:00. As you can tell, this would disrupt the proposed equal balance between shifts and world-powers. Unfortunately, this also applies to each other Lagrange point. FURTHER DISCUSSION @ BOTTOM OF POST 

As a rule of thumb pack animals can carry about 30% of thier body weight reliably. This is for purposes of packing however, a battle charger would need speed, and so one would need to have that ratio be even better, maybe 15% to 20% of the animals body weight. Minimum size to be reliably ridden is about 800 kilograms, but for battle purposes I would say the lower size limit would need to be roughly about 1000 kilograms or larger. This is an animal that is going to be bigger than a bull moose. 

The Oldest Profession Androids don't get tired, they don't get sick, and they don't get traumatized and can feel emotions selectively, most of all they can calculate and catalog values with zero errors and never forget what they are owed. This means they are the ultimate pimps, ever been bitch-slapped by a titanium-boned hand? yeah. You're not gonna be skimming from SN-142675-A3's cut of the take ever again are ya ho? These androids operate brothels full of human "merchandise" where they obtain items that are valuable to meat-bags which they can then trade for things that are valuable to themselves. It also lets them feel superior to the fleshy meat-puppets that used to utilize them as "domestic" servants once too.
