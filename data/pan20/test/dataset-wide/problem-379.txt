The L4 and L5 Lagrange points are as far from the planet as the planet is to the sun, so mirrors placed there would be too far away (and therefore would need to be very large). Giant reflecting mirrors have been proposed as a way to warm up Mars, but they would have to be in (a reasonably close) orbit around the planet. I have no idea what would be best, but supposing you wanted them to direct most of the sunlight toward the poles, you could maybe have a constellation of them in something like Molniya orbits. The mirrors could help turn the solid carbon dioxide in the poles to gas and increase the greenhouse effect. If there's a lot of frozen subsurface water on Mars, as it seems there is, water vapor would also then contribute to this effect, as well as other gases that are currently trapped in the soil. This could work for terraforming Mars because Mars is (barely) on the habitable zone and is not too small to retain an atmosphere at relatively high temperatures. You would also have to work to keep that denser atmosphere from being carried away by the solar wind and/or photodissociated, which is in fact what probably happened long ago to Mars. Heating them up wouldn't work like that on smaller bodies, which upon getting warmer would just lose gases to space. The Jovian satellites in particular are subject to a lot of hard radiation from Jupiter, that would only strip them of their new atmospheres a lot quicker than plain solar wind. And Titan, though reasonably large, has a very dense atmosphere only because it's so cold. 

Some of these things may not be true but if you can convince the immortal prisoners that they are, or make them doubt, that would be an extra reason for them not to try to kill themselves. It would help, of course, if these immortals had discovered their own condition fairly recently in historical terms. That way they wouldn't have a "tradition" or clear knowledge of the general effects of dying and resurrecting repeatedly. 

Take a look at the life and works of Sathya Sai Baba. He was acknowledged as a god, or at the very least a man with divine qualities, by many of his many followers. He lived in a specific place (places, actually) where people came to see him, to be near him, to hear him speak, to touch him and witness his supposed miracles. As a god, Sai Baba was believed to have the power of bilocation, that is, of being in two places at once, which was "confirmed" by several witnesses, as well as clairvoyance and materialization. So he was a god on Earth, who walked among the people and who supposedly could see everywhere, be anywhere and create objects at will. Yet Sai Baba had to set up an organization. He had people build several ashrams for his use, and people who tended to the thousand of visitors he received, and of course many people who took his "teachings" and collected them in books or in audio tapes, or simply repeated them to other people, via live speech or Facebook picture posts. Some of these people have made careers out of this; some are officially recognized by the leaders of the worldwide Sai Baba organization. Note that all of the above is independent of whether you believe in Sai Baba, whether he's truly a god or not, and whether he could've managed without help or not. This is just one of several, possibly many, real-life models you can study to understand how even a real god might need a priestly class, or at least an official recognized helper class. 

White dwarfs, since they have a very small surface area, cool down slowly (and the cooling itself decelerates over time). The inner part of the star stays very hot for a long time and radiates slowly through the crust. It's not clear how much time it might take for the crust of a white dwarf to cool down to Earth-like temperatures, but it must be a lot (in the order of trillions of years). The rotational speed needed to counteract the equatorial gravity of a white dwarf is immense, as you're assuming an object with roughly the same equatorial circumference as Earth but about the mass of our Sun. The only big solid bodies that rotate that fast are neutron stars, and they are much more compact than white dwarfs. Also, it's unclear how an Earth-size object could naturally gain such angular momentum. Neutron stars do because they shrink a lot in size. 

Synthesizing a new stable element would also not be immediately dangerous: it could serve some useful purpose, or not. 

If you assume that finding this limitless power is possible but not terribly easy, you have a reason why this was not discovered by accident in the remote past by people unknown. There will always be a first. If the first person who discovered this power immediately chose to remove it from the world, then that means nobody else will stumble upon it. If once removed that power cannot be restored even by the same person who removed it, then that's it: no magic for anyone, ever. I think it all depends on how magic actually works, what its basis is, etc., as well as what you want to go with this plot. It might be that all this first person did was disguise magic or make it very difficult (not impossible) to find again. There are many possible reasons why something is not discovered until a certain point in history. For example, the source of magic in your world could come from a "magic portal" that happens to be in an uninhabited continent or island, or it could require that the magician ingests the flowers of a certain plant that only grows on a given spot. As well as it's not obvious, it could work. 

A close binary with identical or near-identical members seems to me a bit unrealistic, but it's not impossible. For two half-solar mass stars to orbit their barycenter with a period of one week, they would have to be about 10 million km from it on average. That's not very far away; tidal effects of each star on the other one will be considerable, though I haven't the faintest idea how that would play out. Also, you didn't mention other planets, but if there's a Mercury there, I don't know if its orbit will be stable. But you're interested in Earth. If the orbits of the star pair and the Earth are approximately coplanar, you'll expect to have an eclipse twice on every orbit. As one star blocks the light of the other one, the total energy received on Earth will drop by half. Since each star has a diameter of 1.1 million km and their average orbital speed is 55.6 km/s, a very crude calculation says that the eclipse should last the time that one star takes to move 550000 km at that speed (this is half the 1.1M km because both stars will be moving in apparently opposite directions); that's about 2 hours 45 minutes. This is a grossly simplified calculation and it won't hold if the stars and Earth are not exactly coplanar, or if their orbits are not exactly circular, and many other factors. At maximum separation, the stars will be about 20 million km from each other; if the line that joins them at that time is precisely perpendicular to the line that joins Earth and the stars' barycenter, then they'll appear in Earth's sky about 7.6Â° apart, or about 14 times the average apparent diameter of the Moon. If this happens at sunrise, the second star will rise about half an hour after the first one (that's ${7.6 \over 360} \times 24$ hours), and likewise at sunset. 

I would say big religions/sects would eventually adjust rather easily to the new facts, as they've always done. For example, when the Catholic Church was faced with the theory of evolution by natural selection, its first reaction was doubt and denial. Later the theologians got to work, while Catholics at large of course also absorbed and played with the fact of evolution, and by the last part of the 20th century it was already possible for the Pope to say that evolution was fine by him, as long as God had invisibly intervened somewhere along the line to make humans into spiritual beings. There are of course conservative Catholics who, like many Evangelicals, do not accept evolution, but they're fewer and fewer. I suspect the new findings about humans origins could be disputed and denied within smaller religious sects, especially those that find themselves in close competition with others (this is, I think, one of the postulated reasons why religious freedom in the United States gave rise to so many fundamentalist/literalist movements). If you're part of a small religious group, you need to differentiate yourself from the rest and from the culture at large, and one of the things you can do (or your leaders can promote) is denying certain things that most other people accept, such as evolution or the age of the Earth or the efficacy of vaccines or (not scientific fact, but moral consensus) equal rights for men and women or the immorality of slavery. It's not really important that you actually believe that: your refusal to accept the consensus is a form of virtue signalling. So I think it would be interesting for you to focus on the immediate reaction to the discovery of our extraterrestrial origin, but the process as a whole (from shock to denial to accomodation to acceptance, cut short for some factions) would be fascinating to play with. Religions being so varied, you can imagine almost anything. 

I think this makes sense, though I don't know of any real-world examples, and it would sound more realistic if instead of "kingdoms" these were better characterized as tribes or clans. Since this is a fictional world, there's no need to refer to political entities using names already laden with real-life historical connotations. What that means: I'm not sure a European medieval king-like ruler would leave territorial disputes with foreigners in the hands of a champion, but I could see this system working where people already see themselves as part of a larger whole, say, a loose federation of tribes or clans with a recognized common ancestry and common customs, rather than kingdoms/nations. Local interests will keep them apart and selfish leaders will emerge but they will have to be more open to such arrangements as you propose. 

Short answer would be no, and short reason would be that an atmosphere is your enemy if you want temperature extremes, but let me take this apart a bit. 

Tapping the vibrations transmitted directly by physical objects would be an indirect way of getting energy from sound. Again, this would be a very small amount of energy. And you'd have to be able to justify how an environment can become and remain so noisy for sound-energy-harvesting organisms to evolve. Piezoelectric organisms may find it useful, instead, to get some energy directly from movement, e. g. in the "roiling storm" scenario. 

In the Riverworld series, Philip JosÃ© Farmer had future humans set up a whole planet to resurrect a sizable chunk of all humans who had died, from the first hominid to the early 21st century. They were resurrected with perfectly healthy, equivalent 25-year-old bodies, and if they died they would be resurrected elsewhere on the planet, supposedly at random (there were no really uninhabitable/inhospitable places in the planet). Of course, humans being humans, there were soon societies built on slavery, and in general lots of situations where people would rather be somewhere else. So the author has to come up with excuses not to have people killing themselves all the time. Some that come to mind:
