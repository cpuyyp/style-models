There used to be castings that were designed to fit over existing brake studs and stiffen frames that had too much side-to-side flex for the cantis to be effective. Don't know if they could be adapted to your purpose, though, and don't know if they're still available. 

Beer. Well, some other stuff too. Mostly you should be eating carbs, and fruits, grains, and nuts are good for those. If it's warm & you're sweating a fair amount you need to get extra sodium and potassium. Some protein is advised, along with a moderate amount of fat, but nuts and beans can supply these. In part your "low energy state" will correct itself after you acclimate to the routine. You do, however, need to make an effort to replenish the calories consumed within 2-3 hours. (I forgot to mention calcium, which may be the most difficult nutrient to get for a vegan, but is needed for muscle energy. Green, leafy veggies are probably your best choice, but inconvenient to eat as "snacks".) 

I'm curious to get some opinions on this from other cyclists. FYI this event took place in Ottawa, Canada. On my work commute, there are about 3 blocks where I ride in the lane with cars because there are no bike lanes or sharrows, and I need to make a left turn in one of two left turning lanes, onto another street which also has no bike lane, and no shoulder. Details below in photo. During that part of my commute two days ago, I stopped at a red light, in the middle of the left turn lane at the front of a line of several cars. The car behind me honked while we were still stopped, clearly wanting me to get out of his way before we'd even started moving. I stayed where I was since there was nowhere to go: another left-turning traffic lane to my left, and a straight through lane on my right that only buses can proceed through. After taking the left turn, I proceeded in the center of the lane for one block before signalling a right turn, after which I normally ride on the side of the lane because there is more space. While I was riding the block right after the left turn, the driver who had honked at me pulled into the other lane to pass, then while passing, i.e. while right next to me, quickly swerved back about halfway into my lane, coming within about one foot of me while I was riding, then back out into his own lane. This was clearly meant as a threatening maneuver to scare me. The vehicle did not make contact with me. I was able to memorize his license plate, make and model, and car color, and I took note of the exact time time, so I can certainly pinpoint who it was in a police report. So I'm wondering if it's worth reporting something like this to the police, or will that just be an exercise in frustration? If anyone has any tips or suggestions on reporting something like this, I would appreciate it. (Again, this is in Canada, so any locally relevant tips would be great) 

Ultimately, for 180km (112 miles) you will be running on empty near the end -- that distance is challenging. But by slowly working your endurance up you can probably make it. DON'T expect to do it with "tricks", though -- the most important thing to do is to just steadily increase your distances. 

From a practical standpoint I suspect you're losing very little efficiency with a moderately worn chain. However, a more severly worn chain (usually at 2-3 times the distance you have on yours) will begin to cause abnormal wear on the sprockets, ultimately damaging them to the point where sprocket replacement is required. And of course, beyond a certain point the chain will skip and shift poorly. However, if you were to measure very carefully you probably could detect some slight additional friction due to the increasingly poor fit between chain and cog tooth. The teeth are very carefully designed to engage the chain evenly, and a worn chain will cause additional friction as the chain slides onto the drive sprocket or off the driven sprocket. 

I think the clue lies in the short distance you ride as there are two uncertainty points in the way your computer works that have a large impact if the distances are short but more or less vanish for longer distances. First lets see how a digital bike computer works: basically it does two things as it counts how often the little spoke magnet has passed its sensor, giving it (with knowledge of the wheel circumference) the travelled distance, and it measures the time between two magnet passages to get the speed. If the magnet has just passed the computer is just waiting for the next time to pass which means that the computer is deaf and blind during this time. If you stop your bike now there's some awkward situation for your computer as it waits for the next impulse from the passing magnet which will never come as the wheel doesn't turn anymore. You can watch this moment on your computers trip timer as the seconds of the stop watch are still counting for about 3 to 5 seconds although you're already standing. This is the time where the computer waits for the the next impulse to come but doesn't get one. Here it gets a bit speculative: I would guess that that your computer has basically two counters, one for the number of wheel rotations and one for the time needed for those rotations, while the trip time is running on a separate counter that is just for the time output but is not taken into calculations. The difference between the rotation time counter (RTC) and the stop watch counter (SWC) is that the RTC contains only the time where the computer can tell for sure that the wheel was turning, while the SWC also contains time where the computer was waiting if the wheel is still turning. As cycling computers are primarily constructed for longer rides (where you normally don't stop every five minutes) this discrepancy won't make a big effect there, but in your case with a very short measurement time it might make quite an effect. If you calculate back from the average your computer has to the time it should have used, you get 6 min 12 sec which is a difference of 17 secs to your computer's trip time. You write something about "traffic light-enforced interval training", so I guess you have to stop at some of them. If you now assume that your trip time will count about 3 to 5 extra seconds at each stop, it will take only about 3 to 5 stops to get the time difference. 

In terms of bike equipment, if the ride is reasonably supported (such that any major repair is either taken care of by a repair van or by hauling the bike to the nearest town) all you need is a couple of spare tubes, a pump, and maybe a multi-tool. A box of tube patches is also nice to have, in case you have bad luck with flats. (Though it doesn't hurt to carry spare spokes of the correct sizes, especially if your bike uses odd-sized ones.) For less well-supported rides you should have a tire "boot" (or a dollar bill to fold up for this use), a chain tool and a few spare links, a few wrenches beyond the multi-tool, a few zip ties, and some sort of tape (I prefer hockey tape). Also some spare spokes (possibly 3 different sizes on your bike) and a spoke wrench, plus whatever tools you need to remove your rear cluster (though perhaps relying on a nearby farmhouse to provide the large wrench required). Or, alternatively, you can carry one of the spoke replacement cable kits. Spare brake and shift cables may be worthwhile (with some sort of cutter), but only if your bike has a history of "eating" them. For a long ride out West, where it may be 50 miles between towns, you'd want a few more items, possibly including a spare tire. 

The adjuster on the picture looks like a quite standard adjuster as it is also used on shifters, derailleurs and the like. If you have such a part flying around that is no longer needed you could see if you can take the adjuster from there. 

I don't think any manufacturer will give you any warranty in case of "abuse" of its products â€“ and it surely could be considered abusive to have a crash with their clothing, even if it was sold as mountainbike clothing. There may be some exception with protective gear, but even then the manufacturer might argue that it was designed to get damaged or destroyed in order to protect you. In this case I could imagine the manufacturer might give you some discount on a replacement, as some helmet manufacturers do in case of a crashed helmet. But for "normal" clothing, I don't think you will have great chances on such warranty. 

Should be OK. I wouldn't advise duck tape, as it will tend to make a mess, and will eventually dry up and move around anyway. Hockey tape would work fine to fill the gap, if you feel the need. 

It's the oil on the outside that collects dirt. I generally over-oil the chain fairly substantially, using a slow drizzle as I crank the chain through several times, then wipe it well. Wait a few minutes for some oil to ooze out and wipe again. Others like to drip a single drop of oil on each link and do a little tap dance after every third link. Whatever floats your boat. 

Can someone tell me what this pin is doing, and was I supposed to remove it before riding the bike? If I'm not supposed to remove it, in what maintenance scenario would I ever remove it? If I was supposed to remove it, is it possible I've done damage by riding with it in place? Thanks. 

In your case there are no bikeways of any kind showing: pathways, or even shared lanes (dotted lines) on the bridge: 

FYI, I finished an 8,200km tour on these tires with no punctures, and a decent but not complete level of wear on the rear. I would not have started another long tour with the same tires. IMO, your tire probably has 5,000km left in it, but you should suck it up and buy a new tire before your next tour so you're less likely to need to replace mid-tour with the challenges that come along with that (Where to buy replacement? Do you need to get them shipped to a hotel? Etc.). When you're finished your second tour, you'll probably have 4 Marathon tires that all have a decent bit of life left in them and you can run them into the ground commuting around town or Randoneurring, situations in which it's not a big deal to have a tire wear out (just replace it at home at the end of the day). That way, you've got plenty of tread for your upcoming tour, and no tires are going to waste long term. 

To check your headset, sit on the bike, lock the front brakes, and push forward/backward with your feet. If you can see any looseness in the headset it needs to be tightened. Since it's so easy to check one should check a few times a year. But no real "schedule" is needed. I've seen headsets that were remarkably loose. Though looseness affects handling to a degree, most people don't notice the problem until (in the old threaded headsets) it gets so loose the ball bearings fall out. Then the bearing grinds and makes handling difficult. 

On outdoors.SX.com also someone presented a slightly different approach that translates different parameters (elevation gain, trail conditions etc.) into distance travelled, which could be another useful approach here. So my question is, is there some rule of thumb or a set of rules of thumb for cycling as well? 

To answer your question title in very short: You don't have to fear them but some healthy portion of respect won't be wrong. The longer version: normally cow herds aren't really aggressive so it is quite safe to just go around the herd (if it blocks the trail) or pass them if they're close to the trail. Going right through the herd isn't a good idea in any case unless you know what you're doing. But there are two situations where some more caution is appropriate: mother cows that want to protect their calves as well as bulls can be somewhat aggressive. If those are present in a herd you should better keep a good distance and maybe avoid the herd by some more amount to prevent coming too close to them. Depending on the size of their meadow it may be the easiest to just avoid their meadow at all or at least forgo them by some 50 to 100 meters. 

Once met a guy who had had his shattered foot "reconstructed" with screws, etc, and it was about half-again as wide as his other foot. He was riding in custom-reconstructed cycling shoes. He told me that the cobbler took two regular bike shoes, cut them apart, and sewed them back together as one. As I recall (it's been maybe eight years), the shoes had cleats, probably SPDs. (Of course, I have no idea who did the work for him, but probably an outfit that does "orthopedic" shoes.)
