Let $S$ and $T$ be commuting measure-preserving transformations of a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$, so $S$ and $T$ define an action of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ on $(X,\mu)$. I am wondering about sequences of finite subsets $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ which are $L^p$-good for the pointwise ergodic theorem in the sense that for every $f \in L^p(X,\mu)$ the limit $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{|F_n|} \sum_{(m_1,m_2) \in F_n} f(S^{m_1} T^{m_2} x) $$ exists for almost every $x \in X$. If $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ forms a tempered Folner sequence, it is well known that $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is $L^1$-good. I would like to hear what is known about analogs of Bourgain's subsequential ergodic theorems - i.e. the case where the $F_n$ are quite sparse. Specific examples of interest are $$F_n = \{(m_1^2,m_2^2): 0 \leq m_1,m_2 \leq n \},$$ more generally $$F_n = \{(p(m_1),q(m_2)): 0 \leq m_1,m_2 \leq n \}$$ for two polynomials $p$ and $q$ with integer coefficients, or $$ F_n = \{ (p_1,p_2): p_1 \mbox{ and } p_2 \mbox{ are among the first } n \mbox{ primes } \}.$$ There doesn't seem to be anything about this in Nevo's extensive survey 'Pointwise Ergodic Theorems for Actions of Groups' from the Handbook of Dynamical Systems. 

Hi, let $1 < p <\infty $, $ 0 < \alpha < 1$, and $ \mathscr{L}^p_\alpha(R^n) $ be the usual Bessel potential space defined by $$ \mathscr{L}^p_\alpha = (1-\triangle)^{-\alpha/2}L^p(R^n). $$ Let $ h \in R^n $, $ f \in L^p $ we denote $$ \omega_p(h) = \| f(x+h) - f(x) \|_{L^p}. $$ This quantity can be used to describe the space $ \mathscr{L}^p_\alpha $. In fact, for $ p = 2 $ the following are equivalent: $$ f \in \mathscr{L}^2_\alpha $$ $$ f \in L^2 , and \int_{R^n}\frac{(\omega_2(h))^2}{|h|^{n+2\alpha}}dh < \infty . $$ For general $ p \in (1,\infty) $, only partial results of this kind are available in a Chinese book. Could someone give me some references for recent progress on this topic? 

Let $\epsilon > 0$. I would like to know if there exists $c < \infty$ such that for all $d \in \mathbb{N}$ the following holds. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ let $N_x$ be the standard Gaussian centered at $x$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ spanned by the vectors $\{N_x: x \in \mathbb{Z}^d,||x||_2 \geq c\}$. Then the $L^2$ norm of the orthogonal projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{V}$ is less than $\epsilon$. I am also interested in the version of this question where the functions $N_x$ are the normalized indicators of balls of radius $\sqrt{d}$. An idea that might be useful is as follows. In order to obtain the desired bound, it suffices to bound the norm of the projection onto the closed span $\mathcal{W}$ of $\{N_x :x \in \mathbb{R}^d,||x||_2 \geq c \}$. Since both $N_0$ and $\mathcal{W}$ are rotation-invariant, the projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{W}$ must be rotation-invariant. Intuitively, this suggests that the projection should be a positive scalar multiple of $f = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u)$ where $\sigma$ is the Haar measure on the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ and $\overline{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is any fixed point with $||\overline{x}||_2 = c$. Now, $\langle N_0,f \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) \left( \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \right)(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \\ \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x)( u \cdot N_{\overline{x}})(x)\, \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} (u \cdot N_0)(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}\sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \leq \delta(c)$ where $\delta:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is a function independent of $d$ with $\lim_{c \to \infty} \delta(c) = 0$. Let $p$ be the projection of $N_0$ on $\mathcal{W}$ and let $\alpha > 0$ be such that $p = \alpha f$. We have $||p||^2 = \langle N_0,p \rangle = \langle N_0,\alpha f \rangle \leq \alpha \delta(c)$. Since $||p||_2 \leq 1$, we have $\alpha \leq 1/||f||_2$. Thus one would need to show that $||f||_2 > \beta$ for some absolute constant $\beta > 0$, as well as confirming the hypothesis about $f$. 

If $f\in L^p(R)$ with $1\leq p\leq 2$, then Hausdorff-Young inequality implies that the Fourier transform $\widehat{f}\in L^{p'}$, $p'$ is the dual exponent of $p$, and $$ \|\widehat{f}\|_{L^{p'}}\lesssim \|f\|_{L^p}. $$ We note that $f\in L^p$ is equivalent to $|f|\in L^p$, so we find $\widehat{|f|}\in L^{p'}$ and $$ \|\widehat{|f|}\|_{L^{p'}}\lesssim \|f\|_{L^p}. $$ So my question arises, does there exist connection between $\|\widehat{f}\|_{L^{p'}}$ and $\|\widehat{|f|}\|_{L^{p'}}$ ? Precisely, does the following $$ \|\widehat{f}\|_{L^{p'}}\lesssim \|\widehat{|f|}\|_{L^{p'}} $$ holds? Note that $p=2$ it is a trivial by Plancherel theorem. 

Hi, let $\Omega \subset R^3$ be a bounded smooth domain, consider the elliptic equation \begin{equation} -\triangle u + u^2div u = f, \quad x \in \Omega, \quad u\big|_{\partial \Omega} = 0. \end{equation} Here the force $f \in L^2$, and $div u = \sum_j \partial u/\partial x_j $. Is there any solutions of the equation in $H^1$? And how to prove it. Thanks for any hints and references. \textbf{Edit}: In fact, the $1-d$ equation we considered is the stationary equation of the BBM equation $$ u_t - u_{txx} - u_{xx} + u^2u_x = f. $$ 

Given an injective linear map $T$ between Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, let \begin{equation} d(T) = \sup \left \{ \frac{||x||_X}{||Tx||_Y}: x \in X \mbox{ is nonzero } \right\} \cdot ||T||_{\mathrm{op}} \end{equation} Let \begin{equation} c(X,Y) = \inf \Bigl\{ d(T): T \mbox{ is an injective linear map from } X \mbox{ to }Y \Bigr \}. \end{equation} Let $\ell^p_n$ be $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the $p$-norm and let $\mathcal{H}$ be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. I would like to know if $c(\ell^1_n,\mathcal{H}) = O((\log n)^k)$ for some $k$. Alternatively, is it the case that $c(\ell^p_n,\mathcal{H}) = O_p((\log n)^{k(p)})$ for every $p > 1$? There is a lot of literature about the Banach-Mazur distance but I have been unable to find information about linear embeddings (rather than isomorphisms). On the other hand, there is a well known result of Bourgain which asserts that a metric space with $n$ points can be embedded in $\mathcal{H}$ with distortion $O(\log n)$, but I don't know if this can be done in a uniform linear way. 

Thanks for Bazin's answer and those comments. Just as Otis Chodosh said, the norm of $\|\chi_jm(D)\chi_k\|$ will decrease rapidly if $\chi_j, \chi_k$ are test functions. This is may not true for characteristic functions. If $m \in S^0$, then the kernel $K(x-y)$ of the operator $m(D)$ belongs to $C^\infty(R^n\times R^n\setminus \{0\})$ and $$ |D^\alpha K(x)| \leq C_\alpha |x|^{-(n+|\alpha|)}. $$ The kernel of $\chi_jm(D)\chi_k$ is given by $ K'(x,y) = \chi_jK(x-y)\chi_k $. Hence $ |K'(x,y)| \leq C|j-k|^{-n} $, which in turn implies that $$ \|\chi_jm(D)\chi_k\|_{L^p, L^p} \leq C|j-k|^{-n} $$ for $1 < p < \infty$. 

Let $\widehat{f}$ be the Fourier transform of $f$ defined by $$ \widehat{f}(\xi) = \int_{\textbf{R}}e^{2\pi i x \xi}f(x)dx, \quad f\in L^2(\textbf{R}). $$ Define a set $$ E:= \{f\in L^2(\textbf{R}): supp \widehat{f} \subset [-1,1]\}. $$ where supp denotes the support of a function. Note that if $f\in E$ then $f$ can be extended to an entire function on the plane $\textbf{C}$. Thus if $f=0$ on the interval $[-1,1]$ then $f\equiv 0$ on the line $\textbf{R}$, and of course $f=0$ on $[-2,-2]$. My question arises naturally, namely does there exist a quantitative unique continuation of this kind. Precisely, I want to know: Question: Is there a constant $C$ independent of $f$ such that \begin{equation}\label{equ-UCP} \int_{[-2,2]}|f|^2dx \leq C\int_{[-1,1]}|f|^2dx \end{equation} hold for all $f\in E$? 

It is well known that if $T$ is a nonsingular transformation of a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$ and there exists an ergodic measure preserving transformation $S$ of $(X,\mu)$ such that $T$ commutes with $S$, then $T$ is measure preserving. I would like to know of there is an approximate version of this fact. More explicitly, let $T$ be a nonsingular transformation of $(X,\mu)$ and suppose that for some small $\epsilon$ there exists an ergodic nonsingular tranformation $S$ which commutes with $T$ and such that there is a set $A \subseteq X$ with $\mu(A) > 1-\epsilon$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}S \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}(x) = 1$ for all $x \in A$. Does this imply that $T$ is close to being measure preserving in some sense, for example do we have that the quantity $||\frac{\mathrm{d}T \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu} - 1||_1$ or the quantity $- \int_X \log \frac{\mathrm{d}T \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}(x) \hspace{2 pt} \mathrm{d}\mu(x)$ is small?
