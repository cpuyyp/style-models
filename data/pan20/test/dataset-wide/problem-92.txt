Alpha centauri is 4.3 lightyears form Earth. so you should see what happens 4 year earlier. Which can actually make for a pretty interesting concept. The second big problem is that the telescope needs to stay fixed on earth (or worse, on a particular city). As you pointed out in your question. This feat seem almost impossible considering the distance, as a fraction of a degree would spell the difference between looking at Earth and looking at Pluto. But it is theoretically possible. Distin's idea of using many telescope might help on that regard. As the redundancy could be used to recalibrate the telescopes in real time, cover for errors and reconstruct a better image afterwards. The last point concerns seeing through the atmosphere. The reason Hubble is located in space is that the atmosphere blurs image. This, along with point number 2, would probably make seeing a distinct city completely impractical. This would probably also prohibit the use of many telescopes like Dustin proposes. This site explains it quickly. This is not really a problem if you wish to see what's happening in space. The telescope would need to be incredibly powerful to clearly see all the way to Earth. Which also implies it would be incredibly massive. Today's telescope do not allow us to see any kind of details of something smaller than a star. I'm afraid I can't give more precise guess at how big it would need to be. Dustin's idea makes this point a little better as the individual telescopes can be smaller. 

Assuming they have "generic" technology and that the gods are not omniscient and that they are mystical. My understanding is that the gods can kill anyone as soon as they know of them. Such that an atlatean could walk amongst worshipper unharmed but should they show who they are they'd die at this moment. Could the Atlanteans hide from the god : Either by (ironically) sinking atlantis? I think Star gate placed atlantis as a sunken spaceship. Could they do the same without the Starship part? Teleportation could play a part in this. Or simply hide it throught light manipulation based camouflage and technological cloacking? Do the Atlatean understand the physic involve in tehe god's "existence"? Could they genetically engineer themselves to stop being "atlanteans" or just stop being human? Could they upload themselves in machine, so that their body can die while their consciousness lives on. Since you mention Star Trek as a guide, I think the cloacking idea is possible. Giving themselves the time to research means to genetically change themselves or just organize hidden party to interact with humans. If my understanding of the dangers is correct, they could trade with men as long as they pretend to be from somewhere else. As an example, they could keep trading with France by pretending to be Greek. 

How do I make the Plasma users as important as the users of other states of matter, in one-to-one combat? Note that they cannot generate new matter, but can keep materials of the phase that they control, in that phase as long as they give it some attention. 

And both of those methods are out of reach of current science, while possibly being the only things that could withstand the impact you're subjecting the spaceship to. 

How would Roman Warfare have changed if they actually had legendary 'flexible glass', and it was cost-effective? Flexible Glass (vitrum flexile) It's an unbreakable, and I mean literally unbreakable, glass. Assume that it looks and acts like normal Roman glass, so an enemy could melt a hole through it, if they wanted, and can be made at about the same price, but it just can't shatter, and instead dents like brass. If you can make glass, you can make vitrum flexile, with just the addition of some additive, which Rome won't run out of. Could you make city walls out of the stuff? 

Go on the sea floor, perhaps the Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the world's oceans. It's super difficult to get to, even with magic? Unless it isn't? 

Realistic? And biological... Basically impossible, unless somehow a collection of viruses can exhibit intelligence... Perhaps program your virus's evolution, somehow ensuring that certain traits would evolve at certain times, being able to customize what traits are evolved in. Possibly some signalling could happen, somehow making your virus radio-sensitive or chemically or something, so you can broadcast a signal from your location, or the virus customizes humans to broadcast heartbeat signals towards other infected, giving data like, "some number infected, some number to go", etc. Maybe this virus can infect anything, turning plants, and moulds and stuff into servers to direct the viruses that are inside humans. 

How would the world economy change if there was a Japanese Cancer Cure in the 1950s, selling for $1000 US a person? The Cure has no side-effects. For a person whose whole body mass is cancer cells, but is still alive... It takes 1 week of treatment. Shrink the treatment length accordingly with less cancer cells. Assume that the Japanese is willing to sell it at the given price, without taking into account shipping fees. Japan is the only manufacturer, and has unlimited supply. Chemo-therapy and stuff working concurrently with the Cure extend the treatment length to become four times longer. Stopping the Chemo. and stuff makes the Cure work as fast as before. Explain how Japan, or a Japanese country has a monopoly on the Cancer Cure in any way you want... 

What I'm trying to say is... On a long enough timeline, no matter how many intermediaries you have, those people will be tortured into giving up the goods, you need a mechanism to prevent it from coming to that point. 

I think something important may have been overlooked in the premise of the question... Faith is, or at least can be, a much broader term. Religious or supernatural faith, belief in unseen powers at work in the universe, is but a tiny sliver of the faith that most people demonstrate. People have faith in themselves, in each other, in leaders, in institutions, in governments, in philosophies, and even in science. The list could go on indefinitely... Is a soldiers faith in his commander or country all that different from a priest's faith in his god? Do these belief structures not provide many of the same sorts of rituals, symbols, morality, codes of conduct, and so on? This may seem to be generalizing an awful lot, but everyone seems to have faith in something, even the atheist has faith in his/her own reasoning. So... Could a society develop without faith? Probably not. Could a society develop without supernatural faith? Most likely yes. 

Umm... The obvious problem would be the death of the joke creator (as depicted in the Monty Python sketch) If such a thing were possible, how does the creator protect themselves from their own creation? How would they know that they had created a lethal joke? How could they share their creation? Luckily no such thing is possible without other significant factors, such as the victim having a pre-existing heart condition or breathing problems... This is stretching things pretty far though. A victim so predisposed to death will die under any significant strain, even a mildly entertaining joke may put them at risk. 

There seem to be more than a few plants that rely on their seeds being eaten to spread and reproduce. Usually herbivores eat the plant and pass the seeds through their digestive systems and deposit the seed on the ground with a lump of fertilizer. Well, what if the seed simply opted to sprout earlier and take root while still inside the unsuspecting animal? Starting its life cycle more like an intestinal parasite and eventually growing to a point where it would block and eventually burst the intestine killing the animal. Then it could take advantage of the corpse as fertilizer. Of course the process would be really slow and painful for the animal, so one would assume that animals would avoid the plant and just not eat it, but I'm thinking that if the process was slow enough most animals wouldn't make the connection between the fruit eaten and the death weeks later. 

Perhaps magic doesn't pollute the environment or something, and works just as well, so they abandon technology to save the environment. 

Or maybe use black holes as shields, to just absorb the impactor, but a baseball-sized black hole, is already too big to be useful, as its gravitational effect affects the movement of the ship too much to compensate for. 

What can I determine about my planet just from that map, if anything? For example, could I tell where the poles/equator are? 

Basically, since its apparently impossible for a HsSSV-01 (Dragon Rider) to be made with parts manufactured with modern materials and tech, what are the specs of the (sci-fi / future) components I'd need to make one? It should look something like this: 

What would be a series of events such that modern adolescence isn't altered much if every human gained the ability to travel through shadows? The shadows have to be able to fit your body, and you have to have seen where you want to go. The lighter the shadows, the harder it is to travel through. Having the darkest shadows on both sides makes it easy as stepping, or jumping or whatever, through. The brightest shadows on both sides, means that it's barely traversable. You faint just from going through, and sleep for a whole day. The spectrum of difficulty is set as the average of both shadows, so a super light shadow connected to a super dark one, means that you can barely stay awake. Shining a light on shadows, makes them stop working as transportation, cutting things mid-traversal. All the knowledge that's initially given to everyone in the world, by magic, is that people can go through shadows. The limitations have to be discovered. Newborn babies also have the shadow-travel knowledge. You can only move something you're holding and wearing though. No draining water from the oceans with pipes that go into shadows. 

I don't think it's actually possible to create a religion that ends in 500 years without involving something other than the religion and a randomized followers... Sorry, but here's some possible loopholes? 

Well, you can still do that, as long as the birthmark is melaninic (brown) instead of vascular (red / blood). Only the vasculars aren't inherited. The melaninic type is. 

Sending another generation to war against their will would certainly tip the scales away from soft and comfy. If enough people are touched personally by the conflict, as in they know people personally that have been drafted, the backlash will probably be considerable. I could certainly see more than a few governors sending state police, or national guard troops to shut down unwanted draft offices. From that point all it would take is one frightened officer to pull a trigger and things could get really messy, really quickly. 

To more directly address the question... After taking the time to adjust​, people can become pretty flexible. At a point, you sleep when you're tired and eat when hungry. Artificial light control can help with adjustment. 

I'm picturing a world with a permanent, dark, overcast sky, but I'm wondering how dark it can be before photosynthesis is no longer an option. It looks like there are a good number of plants that have good shade tolerance, but I can't find any real information on the bottom limit. There also appear to be, a few plants that don't need to photosynthesize at all. The closest analog I can think of is the oceanic zones, photic and aphotic. Photic being the top layer of a body of water where most, if not all, of your photosynthesis is happening. Aphotic being too deep for enough light to penetrate. Apparently the photic zone: 

What about community service hours? You could even make the punishment fit the crime in some cases. If the person is found guilty of jaywalking, make them to spend their days off as a crossing guard. If the person is found guilty of littering, make them to pick up trash on the side of a highway. And so on... This kind of alternative sentencing is already becoming a little more common in some juvenile and misdemeanor courts in the US. 

I think it would be a safe assumption that flight would be one of the dragons' early adaptations. Developing wings after getting too big would be troublesome for dragons who sprouted wings before the wings became strong enough or large enough to provide lift, the precursor to useable flight wings would be a liability for a large dragon and probably wouldn't pass on very well. So, your prehistoric dragon would likely start off as a small, canopy dwelling predator with rudimentary gliding capabilities, like a flying squirrel. At this stage the going adaptations for avoiding dragon attacks would be:
