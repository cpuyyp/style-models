A great place to start would be watching this young woman's youtube videos. She started out in a similar place to you (not knowledgeable about nutrition, overweight her whole life, ~330Lb, etc.), and has lost approximately 180 pounds over the course of a few years. Many of her videos contain extremely practical and specific advice, and her story is pretty inspirational. I think the most important thing she did was research losing weight for 4 months before starting on her weight loss plan. When she started, she knew pretty much what to expect, and was motivated to continue tweaking her plan as some things worked, and some didn't. I've read a lot about losing weight, and lost around 50 pounds in the last year. I don't think anyone but you can figure out a diet/exercise routine that will work for you. You need to find a set of dietary changes and ways to introduce exercise into your life that will lead to long-term changes. I can recommend a few things that worked for me, but they may not all work for you. I'm sure there are things that will work for you that no one here has listed. Experimentation is key. I'd suggest trying out the ones that sound appealing or manageable (especially the first one), and go from there. 

Following that data, your optimal protein intake would be something between 80 g and 100 g, but this does not mean that you should skip the gym altogether. On the one hand there will still be neural adaption (depending on the weight/reps) and on the other hand there is still an effect on protein synthesis if you are at 1 g per kg bodyweight (there is a ugly but very informative graphic at the end of the Studies on the optimal protein intake section of the article). 

The YAYOG app lets you define your custom workouts. They have multiple exercise types, including Tabatas, which are HIIT intervals with 20 s load and 10 s rest. You could - for example - create a Tabata workout with 10 rounds (3 min) of push ups and 10 rounds of squats. 

My aim is to build strength and moderate muscles. Is there anything to improve with this program? Are there any seriaous flaws? What additional leg excercise can I incorporate in day 2/4? 

The ballpark is something around 2 grams of protein per kg bodyweight to gain muscles. Assuming a weight of 80 kg that would be roundabout 160 g. You could reach this (for example) whith 

In other words, high intensity intervals led to increased fat loss, and increased some measures of insulin sensitivity. Here's a link to a few more studies, with promising results. That said, HIIT can be quite difficult, probably more difficult than standard cardio or many types of strength training. So while I'd recommend trying HIIT, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good: the best exercise is the exercise you do. Giving up on an exercise program burns 0 calories. Another aspect to consider is ancillary benefits. IMHO, improving strength and flexibility will make you feel better faster than cardio or HIIT. Strength training can improve pain of various sorts (especially back pain) and make it easier to start other kinds of exercise programs. 

Small changes in a flux of 6Kg/day can change your weight considerably. I've been tracking my weight for almost a year in a similar manner to you, and I find that the day after I go running, I frequently lose up to 2KG or around 2.5% of body mass! I then proceed to gain all that back over the next two days, and I'm back approximately where I started. My theory is that I'm depleting/replenishing my glycogen stores, which take up several times their weight in water, though other factors are presumably at work. In any case, daily fluctuations of 2Kg are in no way uncommon for me, and they're probably unavoidable. Walker suggests using a (smoothed) moving average to factor out daily fluctuations, and only look at the trend line, which has worked well for me. 

There is a great article of Bayesian Bodybuilding (see here) conferring the results of various studies. They are stating that 

I'm doing bodyweight excercises for some years now with mediocre results (I know that the results can be way better when lifting, but due to time constraints, doing BWE at home is the way to go for me). To improve my results and accomodate my restrictions I made up my own program based on my experiences with YAYOG and Start Bodyweight, considering how my body reacts to different types of stimuli. Basically my program is a split routine with workouts on four days a week (monday, tuesday, thursday, friday - for what it's worth), dedicating two days to push/pull excercises and two days to core/legs. More or less I will build my program upon the progressions from start bodyweight, e.g. start with assisted pull-ups, then eccentric pull-ups, normal pull-ups, etc. I will do four sets of each progression, the first one being a warm-up set with a decreased load (e.g. 3/4 push-ups) and the subsequent normal sets with full load (e.g. normal push-ups). I will aim at 8-12 reps per set, gradually increasing reps until I reach the 12 reps, then proceed to the next excercise from the progression. I know that it's little rest, but I'll aim at sets of two minutes. Workouts: 

I like to exercises while watching TV, and don't particularly want to get more home exercise equipment (like a bar or stand). What equipment I have is mostly stuff my wife has used for pilates and physical therapy. I have small dumbbells up to 10 pounds, a yoga strap, a balance board and an inflatable exercise/stability ball. I usually do jumping jacks, pushups, crunches, various core/leg exercises, etc., but I'm looking specifically for exercises which would be useful in training for indoor rock climbing (mostly biceps and lat exercises). I've tried: 

Yes there are muscles between your ribs. They're called the intercostal muscles, though "soreness in ribs" might also be caused by soreness in your pectoralis minor (which connects to the front of the rib cage) or your serratus anterior (which connect your back to the side of your rib cage). A good hint that it's muscle soreness instead of connective tissue soreness is that muscle soreness usually feels good to massage, while tendon/ligament/joint soreness does not. The main use of the intercostal muscles is in opposing the diaphragm in breathing, but they're used in lots of movements. I get rib soreness after doing planks for a long period, so I suspect that is the main source of the soreness (a pushup being a like plank++). I would guess that the reason that your intercostal muscles are sore is because they are being used to hold the rib cage rigid, while forces are being transmitted between the serratus, pectoralis minor and rectus abdiminous. Dynamic tension between these muscles (and many others) lets your back stay flat and rigid while you're doing planks or pushups, but since a lot of the force is transmitted through the rib cage, your intercostal muscles contract and get stretched as you go through the movements. Like any other muscles after a working/stretching them, they get sore. It's probably especially noticeable since you do very few exercises which exercise your ribs. Here's a video showing the main muscle groups used in pushups, and here's an animation showing them in action. Hopefully you can see the stresses put on the rib cage. Pushups are really great exercises precisely because (if done properly) they strengthen so many different muscle groups (even ones you were unaware you had!). This is also one of the problems with Nautilus machines for strength training: by isolating muscles you miss out on strengthening small stabilizing muscles like the intercostal muscles and you can end up with big muscles but not genuine strength (and an increased risk of injury). I find that stretching my rib cage can help with soreness (though stretching beforehand or immediately after doesn't do very much). For soreness from pushups, my ribs tend to get more sore on the sides of my body, and a good stretch for that is the side angle pose from yoga. Finally, it's interesting that you get rib soreness after situps. I haven't had that experience, though situps are also complex exercises which use a lot of different muscles groups. Perhaps another answerer can go into that in more detail. There are a ridiculously enormous number of muscles in your back and shoulders. Planks are really complicated exercises. 

You could have a look at Freeletics. There are many workouts you can choose from, most of them being HIT workouts based on bodyweight exercises. I don't know, if there actually are HIIT workouts, but it's definitely conceivable. There are some free workouts, but for most of them you'll need to have a subscription. You can start the workouts both from the website and from the app. Both will keep track of your times and guide you through the workouts. 

The person eating fast food will mostly gain fat, not muscles and therefor maybe look bigger, but this is not due to more muscles. Having said that, eating healthy and gaining are not mutual exclusive, but you have to consider the following 

They are comparable only to a certain extent anyway, and you can't equate 14 kg dumbbell curls to 28 kg barbell curls. Assuming you mean performing the exercise asymetrically (one arm at a time) vs. symetrically (both arms at the same time), I would not use the total weight, but the weight per arm. Anyway, this is quite subjective and I don't think that there is the "correct" way of doing this, this is rather a matter of taste. The correct way of doing it is the one that works for you. Anyway, it may be advisable to stick with a scheme, because you are likely to get confused if you don't. 

In the book The Science of Yoga, William Broad discusses this in detail. My summary: for measures of cardiovascular fitness, Yoga is inferior to aerobic exercise. Indeed a small study of Yoga instructors (who do enormous amounts of yoga) found them to be roughly equivalent in measures of cardiovascular health (VO2 Max, etc) to someone who jogs 3-4 hours per week. Yoga is also inferior to weight training for gaining strength. Not really too surprising: exercises designed to specifically target certain ends are superior to flexibility exercises. However yoga does have significant benefits. He discusses studies showing that yoga can improve spinal health and treat back pain (one theory being that flexing the spine oxygenates the intervertebral discs, which may not get moved much in a sedentary lifestyle). It reduces stress hormones, may increase testosterone levels in men and various miscellaneous small benefits. The main large benefits seem to come in treating shoulder or back injuries. Personally, I do all three: yoga, weights and cardio. Of the three yoga is the most fun, so I'd say give it a try. The poses generally feel good, help with my back pain. It may not be superior to other forms of exercise on most measures, but it's worth doing for its own sake. 

Supplemented protein should ideally be only a small part of your total daily protein intake. There are sources of very good proteins (depending on your diet). 

Assuming that with "arms together" you mean barbell biceps curls and with "arms singularly" the dumbbell variation I'd advocate to treat them as different excercises. You either have 

Yes and no. Doing weight lifting will set the stimulus your body needs to grow (gain muscle mass), but lifting alone will be of no use. Imagine that your caloric intake was 1000 kcal per day (extreme value, just to make the point) while lifting. If your caloric intake would not suffice to supply you basic functionality (movements, keeping temperature, etc.), how should you gain any mass? How many calories should I eat then? While I think that in former times way larger values have been promoted, state-of-the-art seems to be a caloric surplus of around 500 kcal on training days (depending on the source in the 300-600 kcal range). Getting your macros right Another important factor is the macros. If you are mostly eating fats and (especially) carbs/sugars you will have a hard time gaining muscle mass (you will most likely gain fat if you are on a surplus). You'll have to intake protein to a certain extent. There is much ado about the exact ratios of protein/fats/carbs and I will not make a recommendation here, but it won't be too hard to find ballpark figures online. Anyway, make sure to avoid unprocessed foods as far as possible. Don't be too dogmatic, but processed foods are (often) packed with minor quality nutrients that might be detrimental to your progress. Strength ≠ Mass I've talked about how to gain mass. Now let's see how to avoid it. First thing to note is that strength and muscles are not the same. You can get way stronger without bulking. The effect of the reps Besides what you eat, another important factor is the number of repetitions per set. To gain strength without gaining mass, you should stick to a lower rep count. Strength regimen is (depending on the exercise) around 4 to 6 repetitions, while classic mass regimen is around 8 to 12 repetitions. 

As for exercise, I would say start with walking, but if that's difficult because of your arthritis, I don't know. Try to move however is comfortable for you, even if it's not much. I'd suggest getting some 5 pound hand weights and just sort of playing with them while you watch TV. For example, lift your arms out to the side, do bicep curls, etc. A Youtube search for "exercises for the morbidly obese" turned up a number of home-videos of exercise advice from very overweight people, many heavier than you. I'm not specifically recommending any of them, but they seem like a good place for you to start your research. See which exercises look attainable and safe and try some of those out. Weight loss is a really agonizingly slow process. The main point is to make sure that it's consistent. Getting down to a healthier weight is probably a multi-year commitment. Losing a pound a week is a pretty agressive, but doable target for most people. But even a pound ever two or three weeks is still movement in the right direction. Expecting faster loss is what discourages a lot of people. Still, it's worth getting started for two reasons. The first is that even relatively small weight loss can lead to significant decreases in the risk for diseases like diabetes. The second is that all weight loss is just trucking on with good habits. If you mess up, don't exercise, binge eat, whatever, none of that matters now. What matters is what you do today, not what you did yesterday that you weren't supposed to. That was the key insight for me both with quitting smoking and losing weight. If I slipped up and smoked a cigarette, that didn't mean that I "started smoking again", it meant that I "had smoked on one occasion". Similarly, if you eat too much one day, that doesn't mean you've stopped losing weight. It's just a temporary setback, not an end to the journey. Good luck!
