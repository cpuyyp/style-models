I think it is beneficial to pedal hard just on the summit. Although tired from the ascent, pedaling hard for 10 seconds quickly brings one to the target speed. Then one can recover on the downhill (tucking in to reduce air drag). Failing to do that leads to spending time in very low speed, waiting for gravity to accelerate the rider, and wasting many seconds. Opinion based MTB riding and no references. 

I recently located this SR SunTour service manual, containing schematics of a load of forks. Trouble is, my fork only has "XCR" on a sticker, and production date stamped. At some forum this is discussed and links are provided to SunTour's XCM, XCR and XCR product lines. Strangely, my XCR does not match visually any of the presented (mine has no V-brake option). Am I supposed to find a model number stamped somewhere on the fork, as with most other bicycle components, or should I deduce which fork it is from the features e.g. wheel size, brake options, outlook, locking and adjustment mechanisms. I would be quite surprised if the model is not stamped. How do bicycle mechanics deduce the model - do they know them all from experience? 

This answer concerns mountain biking. My backpack has a dedicated helmet holding piece, but I don't use it, as inserting or removing the helmet requires adjusting 6 adjustment straps. Instead, for longer climbs, when wearing a helmet would only be filling my eyes with sweat, I clip the chin strap under both of the top cover straps. This keeps the helmet mostly in place. On the other hand, on a short climb, or when in the city I want to enter a shop, I clip the shoulder strap to the plastic ring on the shoulder strap. That way I can put the helmet on and off without stopping riding. On a side note, I use those rings also for protective glasses and cable lock. For me, both of those methods result in gradual stretch at the buckle of the chin strap, so the helmet needs to be re-adjusted now and then. Experience on a couple of 2 mid-range helmets, mostly dirt road and trail riding. 

Is there a reference on on-line source of information on what certifications have been awarded to all helmets currently available on the market? For example I'm specifically trying to determine what certifications the 2011 POC Trabec Race Helmet has, but can find no sites that list them. (The manufacturer has a list for it's own products, but does not include this helmet.) 

Here and in subsequent figures, four systems are shown, London's, Boston's, New York's and Washington DC's, represented by the livery color used by each — light, Barclay's blue for London, Hubway green for Boston, dark "citi" blue for New York, and red for Washington DC. Solid lines are for single day plans, while thin dashed lines are for example annual plans, assuming 50 rides. The first thing that's clear is that — not surprisingly — cost goes up with duration. The second is that plans have similar structures, in which costs go up in steps, typically at 30 minute intervals. More surprisingly, perhaps, is the significant difference in cost, with New York being most and London being least expensive. This figure is a bit misleading though, since all of these systems are designed for short rides of generally less than 30 minutes, and certainly less than an hour. Focusing on these gives a better picture of actual scenarios: 

Over this range the outstanding feature is the rise and fall of per minute cost, the initially very high cost per minute, and, again, the large difference in cost between systems. 

Here, some odd features are exposed, notably the leveling off of cost per minute, the jump in average cost in London (from being cheapest, to matching New York's most expensive), and the long decline in some cities. Again, it's most useful to focus on short rides: 

Congestion charging: a very effective way of reducing the number of cars on the road, and increasing the average skill of the drivers that remain (since an increasing proportion of the remaining drivers are professional drivers). 

Many blogs and other sources of information on cycling advocate "riding like a car" or "taking the lane" as a way to increase safety and visibility when riding on a road. But such advice presupposes that doing so is legal. Is it generally the case that bikes may use the "full lane", or is it better to check with local ordinances? Is there a general rule of thumb one should apply in cases where one is not certain about local rules? 

It is tricky to start pedaling uphill, especially with some complicating factors out there. I want to learn the proper technique. Saddle height For any uphill, I put my saddle at "XC height", that is, leg straight when the pedal is in it's lowest point. Is this correct? White scenario You are spinning up a steep slope, suddenly the rear tire shoots a large stone out you loose control. You either have to get off the saddle and put a leg down, or tilt the bike at 45 degrees and put a leg down. In both cases the bike comes to a complete stop. How do you re-attack the slope? If you try standing on the pedals for more initial power, the back tire will spin out on the loosely-packed dirt and gravel. To si on the saddle is awkward, as the slope is adding to the saddle's height. Black scenario You are blazing down a 6 degree decline on an unknown trail, do a swithcback ... and are faced with a 500 meter barely rideable uphill. You try to switch gears, but do not succeed in time. Now you are at a totally wrong gear, some 10 meters up a hill, that you must ride up. What do you do? What I do White scenario: 

So what is a Q-LOC axle? If I decide to install a fork with such an axle, do I need another front wheel or is is it possible that my current QR hub is compatible. What do a Q-LOC wheel look like and how much do they cost? 

Please do the following experiments: Release the brake cable, pulling (1) apart from (2) (no tools needed). Swing the brake arms one at a time, making sure they have nice spring-y reaction the last 2-4 centimeters of their travel towards the rim. 

I ride XC for recreation: trails, dirt roads, gravy roads, some rock beds. The bike has a hard-tail frame with, 80mm travel fork and 2.10 inch tires. I have noticed that pumping the tires a lot makes riding on asphalt easier, however grip is reduced off-road. How should I determine the correct pressure of the tires for optimum grip when descending, while still avoiding pinch flats? Can this be expressed as a function of the recommended minimum and maximum pressure? Is it different for the front and rear tire?
