Showing that if product of $ n $ Toeplitz operators is again a Toeplitz Operator.this is open and quite elementary to state. $URL$ 

Szemeredi's theorem and its special case roth's theorem have been given quite conceptual proofs by Hilel Furstenberg using ergodic methods which I think is quite natural while the initial proofs were extremely complicated. 

Sigurdur Helgason in his book "Differential Geometry,Lie Groups and Symmetric Spaces" proves various results like geodesic is locally length minimizing,compact group of isometries acting on a manifold of nonpositive curvature have a fixed point and many more without using any variational techniques involving jacobi fields but rather cartan structural equations. 

Classification of symmetric spaces by using classification of simple lie algebras due to cartan is my favourite one! 

Is it known whether siegel upper half plane is dense in the space of nonsingular matrices of same dimension .$.$URL$ Actually the question i have in my mind is to show that almost all 2 diml complex tori are not abelian varieties.I think I have solved the problem by using the answer given below. 

1)You look into the book "Noncommutative Dynamics and E0 semigroups" by William Arveson 2) There is an approach to attack multivariate operator theory through algebraic geometry.You may look to "Operator Theory and Complex Geometry" by douglas for an introduction 3)You may look into brown,douglas,fillimore's paper in essential normality and K-Homology which was a precursor to connes approach 4)or look into connes's book 

Given a function $ g $ entire on the whole complex plane $ C $, it is possible to find an entire function $f $ such that $ f(z+1) -f(z)=g(z) $. The proof can be given using riemann surface,automorphy,covering,etc. Can anyone find a elementary proof which avoids all such things. 

I must mention the holomorphic morse inequaties due to demailly which has lots of applications in algebraic and complex analytic geometry . It's an analog of the usual morse inequalitites.$URL$ 

What is the status of Invariant subspace problem on Krein Space? What sort of developments have taken place in this area. 

Corona Problem for more than one dimension on polydisk and unit ball is one that has resisted solution but partial results are available . 

Can we interchange the order of integration of following double integral ? $$I = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} F(x,y) \overline{R(x,y)} - R(x,y) \overline{F(x,y)} \; dx \; dy$$ Where $F(x,y)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ and $R(x,y)= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^2 n^2 f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ With $f(x)$ a function from $\mathbb{R^+}$ to $\mathbb{C}$, exponentially decreasing at infinity, such that near zero the asymptotic is $f(x)= a.x +O(x^2)$ ($a$ is a complex constant) and $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx=0$ If we could interchange integration order we would have immediatly $I=0$: $$ I= \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) \overline{x^2 n^2 f(nx)} - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x^2 k^2 f(kx) \overline{ f(kx)} \; dx =0 $$ The integral $I$ can also be written (for $n$ and $k$ strictly positive integers) : $$I= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n \ne k} f(nx)\overline{k^2 x^2 f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} - n^2 x^2 f(nx)\overline{ f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} dx\; dy$$ $$I= \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \sum_{n \ne k} (n^2-k^2) x^2 f(nx)\overline{f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} dx\; dy$$ So showing we can interchange integration is equivalent to show that following integral is well defined: $$ \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\infty} | \sum_{n \ne k} (n^2-k^2) x^2 f(nx)\overline{f(kx)} e^{2 i \pi (n-k) y} | dx\; dy$$ But how can this be proved? I post a similar question here: Is this double integral of Fourier series always real? Note: $I$ is well-defined as $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y} $ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^2 x^2 f(nx) e^{2 i \pi n y}$ do not have any singularity for $x$ near zero (this can be shown using Poisson summation formula, even for $y=0$ there is no singularity as we have $\int_{0}^{\infty} f(x) dx=\int_{0}^{\infty} x^2 f(x) dx=0$). 

There is the conjecture that Selberg Class L-functions satisfy RH. So that an L-function needs to have its coefficient multiplicatives (plus other conditions: functional equation,...) in order to satisfy RH. But I would like to know if for a L-function of Selberg class it is possible to find another L-function having the same non trivial zeros (strictly in the critical strip) but having "the sum of its coefficient" bounded instead of "multiplicative coefficients". Meaning that for a L-function of Selberg class $L(s)= \sum a_n n^s$ with multiplicative coefficient $a_n$ there is another L-function $L_1$ (of Selberg class or not) having same non trivial zeros as $L(s)$ such that $L_1(s)= \sum b_n n^s$ with $\exists K, \forall N, |\sum_{n=1}^{n=N} b_n| \le K$ For primitive Dirichlet L-functions the function is itself satisfying the condition. But for the Zeta function we need to multiply it by $(1-2^{1-s})$ in order to obtain the Dirichlet Eta function which has the same zeros (strictly in the critical strip) as Zeta with the sum of its coefficient bounded. (And no more multiplicative property for its coefficients) Any existing results on this question ? May be it is obvious that such equivalence does not always exists? 

if f is in $H^{1}$ the Hardy space with integrable norm, and if f is not identically zero, then the zeroes of f (certainly countable in number) satisfy the Blaschke condition.Can any "Blaschke condition" be defined if hardy space is considered on the upper-half plane instead of unit disk. Curious to know if this carries over by the conformal equivalence that maps upper-half plane to unit disk and vice-versa. 

What is the origin of multiplier ideal sheaves?It was introduced ny Nadel.Yum Tong Siu,his advisor in his plenary lecture in 2002 icm mentions some thing that it arose in pde.Can anyone kindly elaborate on the motivation behind defining multiplier ideal sheaves.I think there are lots of experts here in mathoverflow who are experts in these things like diverio and many others.$URL$ this is I think one of the most standard places to learn about it. 

I think Complex Algebraic Curves by Frances Clare Kirwan is a great introduction. In the first chapter,she speaks examples of brieskorn sphere. Abel's theorem is treated quite nicely. and much more! 

Dear mathematicians, I want to know how much advance there has been in complex dynamics of several variables. I am at present reading Carleson's book on Complex Dynamics on one variables.Curious to know about several variables case.t Specifically,what are the best papers in this area. 

Is there any known generalization of the riemann mapping theorem over skew-fields of quaternions and beyond or at least a conjectured formulation of it? In a less focused way, how far does the main results of complex analysis and fourier analysis carry over to quaternions. 

I would have like to have a list of different proofs of the fact that compact riemann surface has a non-trivial meromorphic function.This is certainly one of the main results of compact riemann surface.Some proofs use sheaves and some more elementary just using forms and some using riemann-roch theorem. 

tao says that geometric nonlinear pde is taking off right now.I think with the works of perelman in resolving the geometrization conjecture, yau in resolving the calabi-yau conjecture,also the works of donaldson,uhlenbeck in geometry,yum tong siu in Analytic Geometry(the monge ampere equations,d bar estimates,etc.), Paul Yang and Sun Yun Alice Chang in Conformal Geometry geometric nonlinear pde is getting very important. The methods developed by these people and the like are proving to be extremely powerful. 

If $p,q:\mathbb R^3\rightarrow\mathbb R$ are two polynomials, such that $\{p=0\}\cap\{q=0\}$ is two-dimensional, does it follow that $p$ and $q$ have a common factor? (I believe it does.) How to prove that? 

Let $V$ be a real affine variety in $\mathbb R^n$, i.e. the zero set of a real polynomial $p(x_1,\dots,x_n)$. Consider the following three definitions of the dimension of $V$, $dim(V)$. : if $I$ is the ideal of polynomials vanishing on $V$, then $dim(V)$ is the maximum dimension of a coordinate subspace in $V(\langle > LT(I)\rangle)$ with a given graded order $>$ on the monomials ($\sum\alpha_i>\sum\beta_i$ implies $x^\alpha>x^\beta$) (see the book "Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms" chapter 9) 

We say that a surface $f(x,y,z)=0$ is ruled if for each point $p$ in the surface there is a line that passes through $p$ and is contained in the surface. See $URL$ for more information. Does anybody know if there is a partial differential equation whose solutions are all ruled surfaces and only them? And what is the equation? Some reference would be helpful, too (different from Salmon's old book about surfaces which I unfortunately find unreadable). 

Let $f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R$ be a smooth function such that for every point $(x,y)\in\mathbb R^2$ the system $$f_{11}+2tf_{12}+t^2f_{22}=0$$ $$f_{111}+3tf_{112}+3t^2f_{122}+t^3f_{222}=0$$ has a solution in $t$. In other words, $f$ satisfies a certain complicated partial differential equation (think of the resultant: $URL$ (Here $f_{ij}$ and $f_{ijk}$ are second and third partial derivatives computed at $(x,y)$.) Is there any chance that the above conditions imply the following statement: "For a given constant $c$, the set of points $(x,y)$ that give a solution $t=c$, if nonempty, is a line, or at least must contain a line." Or, if it doesn't hold, do you see a way to add some natural generically satisfied condition on $f$ so that it holds? This is not my specialty, but I would be surprised if it's true. 

Definition 2: $dim(V)$ is the largest $d$ such that there exists an injective semi-algebraic map from $(0, 1)^d$ to $V$ (see "Algorithms in Real Algebraic Geometry" chapter 5) : $dim(V)$ is the largest $d$ such that there exists a subset of $V$ homeomorphic to $(0, > 1)^d$ 

Is anyone in posssesion of the Ottmar Loos's old books on "Symmetric Spaces" . I have consulted Ottmar Loos himself as well as other experts like Prof.Parameshwaran Shankaran about the book. In their opinion there is none available right now online. The book is a good complement to Helgason's which is a extremely demanding book . 

I am trying to read the proof of torelli theorem by Henrik H.Martens "A new proof of torelli's theorem" Annals of mathematics vol78 no. 1 .The proof seems to me like using mysterious combination of 3 lemmas and techniques .Is there any way to find motivation behind the proof.Although I can understand it line by line, I cannot get how the proof is working.This is the proof given in Raghavan Narasimhan's book on compact riemann surface. 

As far as I have heard,Sophus Lie's aim was to construct an analogue of galois theory for differential galois theory. I am familiar with lie group but not with differential galois theory. What is the difference is philosophy between these 2 subjects-Lie groups and Differential Galois Theory? 

"Suppose that X is a compact projective manifold equipped with a K¨ahler metric ω. Let L be a holomorphic line bundle In general, there exists a hypersurface H ⊂ X such that X \ H is Stein and L is trivial over X \ H" this is a result demailly states in the paper Singular hermitian metric on positive line bundle .Can this be proved in case of compact riemann surface using elementary methods. 

How is Hodge theory of harmonic forms related to maxwell's equations.Atiyah says that Hodge was directly motivated by considerations of maxwell's equations while commenting on donaldson.

What are some of the spectacular applications of functional analysis to apparently unrelated problems.One that comes to my mind is Per Enflo's resolution of Hilbert's 5th problem.There are also reformulations of RH in Hilbert Space.I would be happly to hear about it's nice applications in geometry,number theory,topology,etc. specially in context to solving conjectures.
