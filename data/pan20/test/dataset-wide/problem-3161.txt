There is a major definition problem here. The cultures you reference did not draw a distinction between church and state. To refuse to offer incense to the patron god of the state was to refuse the legitimacy of the state. One metaphor might be that to refuse incense was like refusing to pay taxes - god and the state deserved their due. In general, these polytheistic cultures didn't care who you worshipped, but they did care if you openly and publicly denied that the patron god existed - that was an act of civil disobedience that no society could ignore. The intolerance wasn't the polytheists, it was the primitive Christians, who refused to acknowledge that their neighbor's worship & participation in the state was legitimate. Primitive Christians denied public ritual, and refused to participate in communal government driven activities. That intolerance escalated to civil punishment. SideNote: it is inaccurate to call state sponsored religion "pagan" - pagan religion connotes rural/uncultured religious ritual. Aside: THere is a good presentation of a related question, Did the Great Heathen Army persecute Christians; different era, different polytheistic pantheon, but the same confusion over the concept of tolerance. 

Loyalists who lived in the 13 colonies fled to Canada because Canada was part of the British Empire. In Canada they could still be British. If they stayed in the colonies they would be traitors to the King. 

(most of the stuff I've read indicates that her marriage to Bothwell was not voluntary; she was kidnapped and raped). Boadica may qualify 

Disclaimer - I'm well aware that these are coarse, unsourced generalizations, and I'll be dissapointed if certain people don't vote this answer down for my hypocrisy; they are correct to do so. I think the other answers are good, but I thought the question would benefit from a brief analysis of the underlying assumptions. 

Yes. Or perhaps "undefined". Was it legal? Where? Who would have passed a law forbidding the practice? Why would they pass such a law? Why wouldn't you pay someone in whiskey? Consider two things - 

I don't understand why Wikipedia says that the nominating committee had 16 members, while India TV states that the committee had 15 members. I don't know which congress committees proposed Patel, but I can speculate based on the following two quotes from wikipedia 

If Patel had a reputation for an anti-Muslim bias, then it seems probable that the states that did not submit his name were the majority Muslim states. 

Although Quayle is the punch lines of many jokes, he had served with distinction, and had been elected with significant margins; those are strong positives for a Vice Presidential Candidate. 

Essentially, I'm arguing that churches were a more important institution in the lives of early colonists than they were in Europeans. Most of the forces that lead to the decline of the CoE are present in the US, but they are operating against a less committed body of believers. 

Modern Europe's situation today is most similar to the period from roughly 400,000 BCE to yesterday. Europe was filled with people organized into varying political units, all of whom experienced both (a) internal governance tension, characterized by diverse internal political agendas and (b) potential external conflict. Each of the governance units had to carefully consider the potentials of cooperation with regional partners or a range of competitive responses up to and including warfare. The economics of the period was characterized by scarcity; none of the political units had sufficient resources to achieve their long term goals. More precisely each of the political units had set goals which exceeded the available resources. The ability to collect sufficient resources to achieve the goals was affected by (1) degree of internal coherence and alignment, (2) changing environmental factors (3) evolving technological changes. 

Wikipedia If the US government had eased monetary policy and supported the banks, they could have reduced the fear of bank runs. Hoarding reduces the money supply; investment strengthens the money supply. Of course the US government couldn't ease monetary policy because they were committed to the gold standard. Roosevelt's committment to the Gold Standard, which prevented the USA from monetarist tools that could have acted as an engine for growth. Update: @pugsville asks whether Roosevelt took us off the gold standard. Roosevelt took us off the international gold standard. The value of the dollar was still tied to gold, but the value was set based on Roosevelt's whim. The international gold standard was still being defended by the Bank of England. Daniel Drezner in his Foundations of Economic Prosperity points out that Roosevelt took the US off the gold standard without coordination with other countries. Had he coordinated our exit, he could have mitigated the damage to the US and world economic system. The US government took further actions to prolong the depression. 

Hat tip to @Anixx, who would deserve credit for the answer if his answer included references. In 2010 870,000 Europeans professed adherence to folk religions; just under 5 million professed a non-Abrahamic religion. It remains to prove that these are continuous; probably the Hindu and Buddhist respondents are immigrants, and I'd argue that they aren't "pagan" whatever that means. "Is there a God" provides a graph showing that non-Abrahamic religions have maintained a substantial membership since at least 1900 - In order to fully answer the question we need to establish that there were non-Abrahamic adherents between the inquisition and 1900. Wikipedia lists execution of 1,175 heretics in 1794 (although it doesn't say whether it was an Abrahamic heretic, I'm going to assume that at least one was non-Abrahamic). In order to establish continuous "pagan" presence, we need to demonstrate that they existed between 1795 and 1900; I'll leave that task to others since I'm about to run out of time. Note: "A History of Pagan Europe" is a book length answer to the question; I haven't read it, but superficially it confirms my suspicion. ** Update** Turns out the book is available & searchable on google books; page 211 references Welsh Bardist activity in 1176, 1594, 1789, 1790, 1791, 1792 and 1819; this would neatly fill the gap. (OP may argue with the continuity from the Roman Era Bards, but I would counter that if there is continuity from 1176 to 1819, then this fits within the scope of the question - particularly as @CGCampbell points out, there was an implicit penalty to professing non-Abrahamic religion during the period.) Aside I have friends who would classify Freemasonry as a form of paganism, and other friends who will emphatically (bombastically) support Roman Catholicism as paganism. I'm not proposing these seriously, but pointing out that "pagan" doesn't have a strong consensus definition. Similar claims have been made about Latter Day Saints, Quakers/Society of Friends. More seriously, if we examine the plethora of sects that emerge from the Reformation, some of them have only tenuous connections to Abrahamic religion. I'm drawing a blank on the name of the Russian sect that advocated that since the Christ wrote a blank check for salvation, it was an insult to commit only petty sins; good Christians were obliged to sin frequently and thoroughly in order to make Christ's sacrifice meaningful. I'm not going to judge their religion or their commitment, but I will submit that few mainstream Christians would endorse the opinion. 

War is between states. If you have two different service branches fighting, then they are pretty much by definition not from the same country. Might be a mutiny or a coup. Might be a civil war, but in all of those cases, the two forces are serving - or attempting to serve - different states. 

Difficult to cite an absence of evidence, but I searched for both young gentlemen's names in connection to Voltaire; the citations for Bache are more detailed and more specific (see above). 

They were assigned to the Musketeer's unit. Unit names rarely designate the actual weapons - for example, there was a regiment of Fusiliers in the UK army in 1962, but they didn't use flintlocks (Fusilier is a word that means "flintlock shooter"), nor do the Grenadiers fight exclusively with grenades. And the Horse Guards... Or to choose another example, every modern cavalry unit uses transport other than horses. Musketeers was an elite unit as mentioned by @lawson and the wikipedia page, and I believe that they are the equivalent of household guards for the king. The Musketeers were assigned to the King (Remember that the King actually had very few armed forces; most were managed by others, or by France, and separate from his command). Also, Muskets are a pretty stupid weapon for urban fighting; although they ride all over the country, the unit is based in Paris, and designed for Paris. 

The point of a duel is to defend one's reputation against an insufferable insult. The duel demonstrates that the individuals in question are gentlemen with courage and conviction and that each values his reputation more than his life. Swords and pistols serve that purpose very well. Both effectively require that one face one's opponent and demonstrate courage. Each party (and their seconds) can see that the other stands firm and does blink or flinch. Bows don't provide that; I suppose it is possible to use a bow at a range close enough to see whether the opponent blinks, but if you are at that range, then swords or pistols are a better choice. In comments above, we got drawn off into a side discussion of whether bows were used by the nobility; while there were cases where nobles used bows, I'd wager the bow was never the weapon of choice for a noble. The defining weapon of the noble class is the sword, and if the goal is to demonstrate one's right to the title of gentleman, then the logical weapon is the sword. [A much longer answer would justify that assertion, and discuss the role of the lance and the pistol; I'm going to leave that to someone else to document] As @Filipof says, it is impossible to prove a negative, but I'd be very surprised to discover a duel fought with a bow. 

(Hint; I may be of Irish ancestry). (Hint 2: I'm trying to go over the top for humorous value; I mean no offense to anyone but Cromwell and Napoleon, and I'm relatively sure they won't take offense). If you're Irish, then the official view is to recognize that Cromwell was a murdering bastard who only fell short of genocide because he was lazy. 

This will be a poor answer because I cannot locate my sources. Several years ago the Colonial Williamsburg podcast did a series of episodes on slavery and indentured servitude. One of the inflection points was Bacon's rebellion; after Bacon's rebellion there was a shift away from indentured servitude and towards stricter forms of slavery. Cultural, legal and other norms began to shift; people feared that those in forced servitude would rebel. It was easier to enforce stricter controls on people who looked differently. Obviously this is only one element in the whole story, but I think Bacon's Rebellion must be mentioned in any complete answer to your question.
