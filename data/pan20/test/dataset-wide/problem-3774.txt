For $n\ge m\ge 2$, define $$I(n,m):= \int _0^\infty\dfrac{\text{arcsinh}^nx}{x^m}dx$$ Computer algebra systems say that the indefinite integral can be expressed in terms of polylog functions (of rapidly increasing complexity), but I see no way of doing the limit $\to\infty$. On the other hand, I have found numerically that $I(n,m)$ can (conjecturally always) be written as a rational combination of zeta values, moreover this happens in a rather beautiful way. Here are the values for small $m$ and then what seems to be the general formula. Defining $\bar\zeta(n):=(2^n-1) \zeta(n)$, it seems like $ I(n,2)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \bar\zeta(n)$ $ I(n,4)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac1 {6}[ 4\bar\zeta(n-2)-\bar\zeta(n)]$ $ I(n,6)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac1{120}[ 16\bar\zeta(n-4)-40\bar\zeta(n-2)+9\bar\zeta(n)]$ $ I(n,8)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac1{5040}[ 64\bar\zeta(n-6)-560\bar\zeta(n-4) +1036\bar\zeta(n-2)-225\bar\zeta(n)]$ (you may want to stop here for a moment before reading on and look if the coefficients tell you something already) and $ I(n,3)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \zeta(n-1)$ $ I(n,5)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac13[ \zeta(n-3)-\zeta(n-1)]$ $ I(n,7)=\dfrac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\dfrac2{45}[\zeta(n-5)- 5 \zeta(n-3)+4\zeta(n-1)]$ Well, in umbral notation introducing a formal variable $\bar Z$, for even $m=2k$ $$ I(n,2k)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\frac1{(2k-1)!}\bar Z^{n}\prod_{j=-k+1}^{k-2} \left(\frac2{\bar Z}-(2j+1)\right)$$ where each power $\bar Z^r$ is to be replaced by $\bar\zeta (r)$. E.g. for $m=6$, the "zeta polynomial" is related to $16z^4-40z^2+9=(2z-3)(2z-1)(2z+1)(2z+3)$. Likewise for odd $m=2k+3$ (sic to make notation more elegant), $$ I(n,2k+3)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\frac{2^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}Z^{n}\prod_{j=-k}^{k}\left (\frac1{Z}-j\right)$$ where each power $Z^r$ is to be replaced by $\zeta (r)$. E.g. for $m=7$, the "zeta polynomial" is related to $z^5-5z^3+4z=(z-2)(z-1)z(z+1)(z+2)$. We can rewrite the expression for even $m$ as follows to look amazingly similar to the one for odd $m$: $$ I(n,2k+2)=\frac{n!}{2^{n-1}} \cdot\frac{2^{2k}}{(2k+1)!}\bar Z^{n}\prod_{j=-k+1/2}^{k-1/2} \left(\frac1{\bar Z}-j\right)$$ where in the product $j$ runs over the half-integers. 

Let $E/K$ be an elliptic curve, where $K$ is a complete local field with residue field $k$ and char$(k) = p$. I'm trying to make sense of Kodaira symbols and Tate's algorithm. My current understanding is: I$_0$ = good reduction I$_n$ = multiplicative reduction with $\nu(j) = -n$. I$_n^\ast$ = potential multiplicative reduction, eventually becoming I$_n$ in a field extension (so $\nu(j) = -n$). I$_0^\ast$ = "non-exceptional" potential good reduction. II, II$^\ast$, III, III$^\ast$, IV, IV$^\ast$ = "exceptional" potential good reduction. These can only happen when the $j$-invariant is equivalent to 0 or 1728 modulo $p$, or when $p = 2, 3$ (where everything is more complicated...) Is this correct? Silverman's Advanced Topics in the Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves has a good table of reduction types when $k$ is algebraically closed, but I haven't been able to find something analogous for more general fields which gives me an overview of the possibilities. Also, why are Kodaira symbols named the way they are? For example, how are the reduction types II and II$^\ast$ related? 

The Petersen graph shows that $f(5)=5$, and it is not hard to see that $f(6)<6$, thus $f(6)=5$ by the left displayed graph where the circles are $abcde\!f$ and $123456$. Further $f(8)\ge6$ by the right graph. To see that it is not Hamiltonian, note that the two violet edges cannot belong to a H-circle. 

I guess it would be asking too much if requiring moreover the integrand to be (more or less) symmetric in $x,y,z$. That is, other than a trivial mean $\frac16(B(x,y,z)+\cdots+B(z,y,x))$. 

The density (i.e. the proportion of $\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2\bigr]^\text{th}$ powers among all values) of a given column is for coprime $k,r$ $$ \begin{cases}\frac3{k+r} & \text{if}\ k\not\equiv r\pmod 2\\ \frac4{k+r} & \text{if} \ k\equiv r\pmod 2\text{ i.e. both odd}\end{cases}$$ and a certain multiple of that if $k,r$ are not coprime. The first entries of $e(n,k,r)$ for $r=2,...,8$ are displayed below, with a "$-$" sign meaning that the corresponding power $d(n,k,r)$ bears a negative sign. (So in fact, compared with the $d(n,k,1)$ table above I have just omitted the exponents $\bigl[\frac{k+r-1}2\bigr]$ for better lisibility.) Sadly I couldn't get the entries of the columns to flush right, and I did not want to do that manually. 

I'm reading "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms" by Stewart and Top, and struggling to understand the argument on pg 962 which shows that the rank of a particular elliptic curve $E_{D(t)}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly 2. Here are the relevant details: Start with the elliptic curve $$E/\mathbb{Q}: y^2 = x^3 + 1$$ and the polynomial $$D(t) = 2t(t - 1)(t + 1)(2t + 1)(t + 2) \in \mathbb{Z}[t].$$ Let $C/\mathbb{Q}$ be the curve given by $s^3 = D(t)$ and let $$E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t): y^2 = x^3 + D(t)^2.$$ For each point $P = (x(t), y(t))$ in $E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t))$, we define an element $\phi_P$ of $\text{Mor}_\mathbb{Q}(C, E)$ by $$\phi_P(t, s) = (x(t)/s^2, y(t)/s^3).$$ Then we have a map $$\lambda: E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t)) \to H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}})$$ given by $$\lambda(P) = \phi_P^\ast \omega_E$$ which is shown to be a homomorphism with finite kernel. We want to use this homomorphism to show that the rank of $E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly two. First, we can find two points, and show they are independent by looking at their images under $\lambda$. This is fine, and shows that the rank is at least 2. Next, we want to show that the rank is at most 2. We know that the image lands in $H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_3))$, the eigenspace on which the automorphism of $C$ given by $\zeta(t, s) = (t, \zeta_3 s)$ acts on differentials as multiplication by $\zeta_3$. This constrains the image to the 3-dimensional space, say spanned by $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ (this numbering is different from the paper). All of this makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is how the authors constrain the image to a 2-dimensional subspace. They define three involutions on $C$, called $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$, and show that the space of $\sigma_i^\ast$-invariant holomorphic differentials is generated by $\omega_i$. Hence the quotient of $C$ by $\sigma_i$ is an elliptic curve. In two cases, the curve is isogenous to $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and in the third case it is not. From this, they somehow infer that the rank is 2. I'm very confused about this, and would appreciate some more details or a reference. Thanks! 

In my recent question about polygonal tilings where tiles can occur in infinitely many positions, both constructions given as solutions are of self-similar nature. This means in particular that there is no periodicity and thus no fundamental unit. What if we exclude the possibility of self-similarity by requiring the tiling to be periodic? The two tilings I used as initial examples are both periodic with $p(\mathcal T)=12$. 

Likewise for the minimal polynomial of $(1+\zeta^n)a$, where $a$ is any real algebraic number. How to prove this? 

As said in my comment, this article gives some partial results: Tamás Lengyel, On p-adic properties of the Stirling numbers of the first kind, Journal of Number Theory Volume 148, March 2015, Pages 73–94. 

I have an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}(t)$, and I want to compute its rank. Does knowing the rank over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ for some prime of good reduction give a bound on the rank over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$? I noticed that magma can compute 2 Selmer groups for elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, so I was wondering if that would give me some info on the rank over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$. Or more generally, how would you go about computing the rank of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$? Note: I've read Stewart and Top's paper "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms", but am wondering about other techniques. 

Let $F_0=0,F_1=1,...$ be the Fibonacci numbers. Is there a known closed form for the sum $\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty q^{F_n}$? By closed form, I mean in terms of well-known functions, the first ones to think of would probably be theta functions. The fact that $\sum\limits_{n=-\infty}^\infty q^{F_n}$ diverges everywhere makes me rather pessimistic, but maybe this series has been studied somewhere? 

Now, as we mathematicians do not necessarily worry about constraints of real life and such things, let's feel free to also consider a continuous version of the problem (which may even be more easy to treat): instead of $N$ counters in a row, we can imagine a circle or more generally a unit sphere $S_n$, each point of which is a potential counter. The (rather small) customers still arrive at an average of 1 per minute. Though the counters aren't discrete anymore, the customers still are as discreet as possible, so each one chooses a point on $S_n$ furthest away from all occupied points and does his business, which takes $k$ minutes. (E.g. on $S_2$ for $k$ big enough, there are very good chances that the six first customers are at the corners of an octahedron. Note that if the two first ones occupy the poles and thus the third one a point on the equator, then the fourth one would not only be somewhere on a half of the equator, but he must choose the antipodal point of the third one, to be as far away as possible from him, too. So I mean 'furthest away from all of them' in a stricter sense, hopefully well-defined, which might make the question more interesting by the possibly more frequent presence of certain patterns, see below.) For a threshold $\epsilon$, we'll define $f_n(k,\epsilon)$ as the average proportion of time when any two customers on the sphere are more than $\epsilon$ away from each other in Euclidean distance. 

Let $p$ be a prime, and $\alpha$ a positive integer. How do you compute the space of $p$-ordinary $p$-adic modular forms (in the sense of Serre) of weight 2 on $\Gamma_0(p^\alpha)$? I'm really only concerned with the cases where $\Gamma_0(p^\alpha)$ is genus zero and $\alpha = 1, 2$. [Edit: Changed from space of $p$-adic modular forms (which is really big) to the subspace of $p$-ordinary forms (which I think should be finite dimensional)] 

Given a polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $d$, consider the following three sets: $$N_1(x) = \#\{k \leq x: f(k) \text{ is square-free}\}$$ $$N_2(x) = \#\{n \leq x: n = f(k) \text{ is square-free}\}$$ $$N_3(x) = \#\{n \leq x: n \text{ is the square-free part of $f(k)$}\}$$ Generally, we should have that $N_1(x) \sim c x$ (not proven for large degrees, assumes that $f$ satisfies the necessary congruence conditions). Then $N_2(x) \sim c' x^{1/d}$. What do we know about the growth of $N_3(x)$? Do we get significantly more values by considering square-free parts and not just square-free values? Any references for this would be appreciated. Edit: Changed from big-O notation to make order of growth more precise. 

Such a matrix (integer version) can be constructed from a magic square, say with entries $1,\dots,n^2$, by adding suitable multiples of all $n\times n$ permutation matrices: e.g. take $N=n^2$ and add all $N^iP_i$, where $P_1, \dots,P_{n!}$ are in any order. This is such a wasteful construction that the question raised in my comment above might deserve some attention: what are good upper bounds for the common row and column sum of such a matrix? 

Now there are other tight constellations, which may be better for certain values of $n$, e.g. for $n=8$ the following, where 2 of the 10 separating lines are also drawn:
