Biking to work is good exercise. It can make it easier to meet our exercise needs. When commuting by bike, what heart rate or power zones do people usually use? What's a recommended target? Should we try to get to work as fast as possible or at a more relaxed pace? Do the commuters decide it based on feel? Which days should we do sprinting? Should we have similar schedules every week? An example of a schedule with the zones can be helpful. Let's say you work full time and you want to break the plateau. You want the kind of fitness improvements that make you bike to work faster and improve race times. Update Dec 20 Possible fitness goals: Faster commuting times, faster cruising speeds, 30 km/h feels easy, faster sprints to decrease missing green lights, being able to outrun wolves and bears. Getting to work faster on a bike means less need for driving to work or e-bikes! If intervals are done, does that mean the next day must be zone 1 to be fully recovered to train hard enough for your next interval session? Is the fat burning zone good enough? 

Even for a recovery week's endurance workout, my hip flexors surprisingly lasted a little more than enough for the workout. Maybe those muscles were my weakest links. 

During FTP tests, I felt that I could test higher for the interval with a cadence that's almost 10 RPM lower. See VO2 Max 2 and VO2 Max 3. 

For speed: clip-on aero bars. You can attach them to pretty much any handlebar. Why? They offer you an extra position on the bike - that's important if you ride for a long while and your hands / arms / shoulders start to get tired. So you'll ride longer without having to stop. They also allow you to get into a more aerodynamic position, which can help in a headwind. Also, they can be had quite cheaply. Endurance and speed: An extra bottle holder. If you have to stop to refill your bottles less often, your overall speed will increase. You can get special ones that can hold a 1.5l bottle, not just the regular cycling bottles. Endurance: Anything that will prevent repairs. Extra-puncture-proof tyres, new chain just before setting out, fresh brake pads, etc. Make sure your bike is in perfect working order before you set out. Any major repairs should be done a few weeks before starting so you'll know they were effective. 

The rear derailleur tension adjustment screw on my 1997 or 98 Veloce 9speed bike is broken. The correct replacement part seems to be the Rd-At115 screw. However, there seem to be at least two more such screws with part numbers RD-DA004 and Rd-Sr014. Here's my question: What is the technical difference between these three screws (that seem to do the same thing)? Diameter (outer? inner?), steepness of the tread? Something else I've overlooked? Also, if they are indeed different, what would be the reason to change the specification of this rather trivial part? 

From local bike stores, it's getting more common for bike lights to have amber for sides. $URL$ $URL$ Here's are some custom made ones. 

When biking to work, my routes have have stop signs, stop lights, and other interruptions every few blocks or so. My understanding is that if I reach my power at target heart rate soon after stopping so that I still save glycogen, my commutes would be faster. I'm commuting five days a week. How effective is it really in practice? How much would I expect my average speed to increase? Update with examples. After stopping at stop signs, I plan to accelerate by keeping my power around 150W depending on my fitness. After stopping at traffic lights, I plan to gradually raise my power to 150W because my heart rate would drop. In both cases, my heart rate shouldn't exceed 180-age. With power, I know that I'm not overshooting it. Update: Sample morning race to work ride in response to a comment. 

By training close to the MAF heart rate but still below it, you need less training time to get the same TSS compared to zone 1. For example, doubling the power output means you need one fourth the duration. Why do professional cyclists still prefer lots of zone 1 training when recovery rides don't need to be long? In polarized training, there's lots of zone 1 training. MAF heart rate Subtract your age from 180 to get the heart rate. Train between that heart rate and 10 beats below. The closer to the calculated heart rate, the quicker the aerobic base will be developed $URL$ 

If you specify what kind of bike you're riding, I or other people might have more specific suggestions. Since you're asking about cost-effective measures, it might help to know how much you're able or willing to spend. 

For your second question, Wikipedia has a list for the Giro (1913, 1946, 1951, 1961-63, 1969, 1971, 1999, 2002, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2015) and the Vuelta (1955, 1965, 1971, 1976, 1990, 2001, 2009, 2010, 2015). (To keep to the same format, here's the TdF again): 1922, 1956, 1960, 1966, 1990, 2006, 2017. So, the Giro has been won 14% of the time by someone who didn't win a single stage, while for the Tour this has only happened in about 6% of cases. For the Vuelta, it's close to 13%. 

Yes, the idea is to have the quickest bike change possible for the person it matters most for. With the bike attached on the same side as the mechanic's, he just opens his door, turns, and grabs the bike. For any other bike, he either has to go around the car, or even remove another bike before getting to the one he needs. As for the obvious followup question (why is the mechanic on the right-hand side of the car?): In case of mechanical trouble, riders and their support cars should stop on the right side of the road. That makes it easier for the rest of the race and other vehicles to avoid the obstacle. (This was actually part of the problem for Richie Porte and his controversial wheel change at the 2015 Giro d'Italia.) Of course, if there is a crash, the support cars will stop behind the crashed rider(s) to protect them from traffic. 

Amber bike lights can improve daytime visibility. This makes sense because white light looks similar to sunlight and amber light stands out more clearly. Being seen sooner means that drivers have more time to react. Possible situations that benefit from improved visibility include users changing lanes, traffic circles, users turning, drivers opening their doors, users waiting at cross streets, and oncoming users passing. Also, amber may be easier on our eyes which can improve safety even more. The question is whether it's legal to use them in BC? Does the BC Motor Vehicle Act say anything about it? If it's not legal, then a possible alternative might be to avoid strobe patterns. Dinotte sells amber bike headlights. $URL$ Video of a Dinotte amber light being used: 

I find that it's easier to maintain my power at a lower cadence. For example, 75 RPM versus 95 RPM. I'm using TrainerRoad. Recently, I've experimented with a higher cadence. On one of the workouts, I could only complete 3 of 5 sets. It felt like hitting the wall which never happened to me before on TR. 

Is it possible that my legs were heavy, making lower cadence even more efficient? My thigh's circumference is 20" and my shin's circumference is 14.5". My height is 5 feet 7. Is it better to do an FTP test with the ideal cadence or the most efficient cadence (the one that allows you to produce the most power)? For my workouts, should I select the cadence that works best for me regardless of their recommendations? Is it likely that my FTP was too low for a high cadence?
