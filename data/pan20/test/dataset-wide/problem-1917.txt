You have a few potential options to move forwards with, I will list them below, take all advice with a grain of salt and use your judgement to decide which is best for your situation: Do Nothing Your first choice could be to simply do nothing and wait for it all to blow over. Time is a good healer after all. If you are so insistent that you are right and he is wrong, then probably avoiding his path is what you want to do to avoid more conflict. However, this is a very poor choice to make, you will come across as petty and stubborn and it will likely affect your credibility in the work place as a professional body. I do not suggest this approach. Apologize Your second choice is to simply apologize for the conflict and attempt to resolve all hurt feelings. You could say something along the lines of 

Honestly, only you can answer this. If you feel comfortable providing a review then do so, otherwise don't but here is my take on the situation. You have nothing to gain from this interaction that I can see. If they are already earmarked as expendable then they are probably just looking for ways to get rid of them. If you say anything that agrees with them, chances are you will be the scape goat for their dismissal. "We had reviews that your work was not up to standards etc etc" You can of course honestly answer dismissively "I'm sorry, whilst I work with X I don't set their targets nor do I review their work loads. I can say however that they are a delight to work with and usually respond quickly with useful information" An important point to remember is: -Don't lie, this will never end well if you lie about them, you are more likely to hurt their employment as well as your own Personally I would go with If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all. For a few good reasons. Mainly is that they came to you, showing they already have things against this employee, anything negative you add will likely be held against you. Those are reasons not to do it but if you still choose to give a review then i offer this: Make sure any criticism you give is constructive criticism. There is nothing to gain from saying "X is bad at Y" There is plenty to gain from "X could improve on Y by doing Z" as this shows how that employee can easily change to remain constructive, this says, this guy is helpful, here is how to keep him around, rather than, this guy is useless, get rid of him. Hope this helps 

This is much better, you explain where the problem is, who it is causing problems for, and where they can find the information to solve it. This should minimize the amount of follow up questions that need to be asked. A key point in improving this skill is to think about what you want to say before you say it. Otherwise you end up stumbling through sentences that seem to have no direction or purpose. 3. Learn to Listen I would say that the most important part of verbal communication is knowing when to stop talking and start listening. Communication requires at least two parties to engage in conversation, if you're giving long monologues then the other person is not being engaged and will likely get bored or irritated very quickly. This also allows you to listen and learn how other people communicate, do they give all the information at once? Do they give information that you usually wouldn't or do they cut out parts you usually give? Listening and learning from your environment is the key to effective communication, verbal or otherwise. 

Talk to your boss's / the people making the decision. Explain that the decision has caused a divide in the team. Ask if other people will be able to attend once the budget is bigger. People don't like being left behind in their careers, so it's important to make it look like they aren't being forgotten. But that's something your boss's will have to tackle, the choice about who goes isn't yours to make, so the fault is not yours either. There are, however, a few things you personally can do to make sure you aren't causing this negativity to stick around. 1. Don't rub it in I'ts important to remember not to rub it in, don't constantly bring up who is and isn't going. It will, obviously, make the situation worse. It's also important to realize that constantly bringing up how unfair it is, even if you are trying to side with them, will seem like you are being condescending, I strongly recommend avoiding that as a topic of discussion completely. 2. Don't isolate them, don't isolate yourselves Sure maybe there is a bit of friction between you at the moment, but sitting in two separate groups at lunch or at other social gatherings your work may have will only perpetuate the divide. Be sure to mingle, be sure to be part of the team. 3. If asked, don't engage If people do try to engage you in this type of discussion, then say that the decision is not yours to make, and that they should, kindly, direct all of their questions to the bosses. This may seem a little cold at first, but really it's making sure you don't get yourself dragged into a discussion that turns into an argument. Engaging in this type of discussion is likely to make things worse 4. Where possibble continue with your job Congratulations, on being good enough at your job that the bosses want to pick you as someone to spend their, limited!, money on to train up some more. It's a good thing to have happen in your career. And whilst you may not agree with their decision you would be silly to try and throw it away by arguing and not working as hard as you have been up until now. 

Other possibilities Your first port of call should be to bring it to his attention, kindly and politely ask if the meeting could be moved to half 9 as that is when your working day begins. Failing this you have a few choices to make, I will list them below: Change your working hours 1). For the three weeks you could discuss with your manager if just for this set of time you could work from 9 until 5, the hours worked would be the same just shifted forwards half an hour. Then you can use 5 until half 5 as that time you wanted personally. Of course only do this if you are comfortable shifting your hours forward. Decline the meeting request 2). I'm presuming the meeting request was sent through email as this is an effective way to get everyone's attention. There is always a decline button. You could simply decline the meeting request with reason and then explain the reason. Leaving it to the manager to decide. Though if you and the pm are in the same building i suggest a face to face discussion, the email approach should only be used if he is in a different office. Take it up with your manager 3). If he refuses to move the meeting you take it up with your manager and explain that you don't work that time so you won't do work in it. This is likely to get you what you want, but at the cost of your appearances at work. I do not suggest this approach if you can avoid it. Attend some but not all meetings 4). If it is only once a week for three weeks then maybe be flexible enough to change your hours only for that one meeting day each week. If it is every day perhaps ask if you could attend on the Friday or Monday of each week. This minimizes the impact it has on your life and also allows you to attend both at the beginning and end of the week to catch up on important information. Attend no meetings If it really isn't vital you are there then perhaps you don't need to attend at all, but the underlying advice for all of these solutions will require communication with the pm at some point so just ask! The worst he can say is no. 

This is lengthy and not very descriptive, you've said there is a problem but you have given no details. Not to mention the length of this means that people will get distracted or overwhelmed. 

First point: Some people are cut out for working alone, with the only interaction being a few emails or phone calls. This isn't for everyone and you can't always make every situation work for every person. Its a person by person specific trait. Second: Do you need to? Sure you could be constantly reminding people you are there but if all it is doing is eating up your time and distracting everyone else from working it is going to be frowned upon. You will (likely) already have a hard time convincing some people that you're working and not lounging around at home, constant reminders you are there could be seen as you having nothing to do or not working hard enough. You should be talking to people when there is something you don't know that you need to know that they do know. You should be contacting people only when you need them. If you feel you need to justify what work you are doing then a daily / weekly report to your manager of what you have done and what you're planning to do can go a long way to reminding him that you are there and working. Perhaps talk with them to see if this is something feasible. Another important point to note would be perhaps voicing these views to your manager will help you a lot. Your manager certainly knows your work environment much better than anyone here ever will. Perhaps tell your manager that you feel left out of the team and would like to engage with the other members more often, what does he suggest you can do? After all, the point of the manager is to remove roadblocks for you, if you feel that the lack of acknowledgement is hindering your work then i'm sure they will be very happy to do what they can to improve your workflow. It is a very difficult thing to do just when you're working from home, it is even harder when there are many time-zones between you (like you pointed out) Now im not saying you should quit your job, but i am saying that working from home isnt for everyone, not everyone can pull it off, everyone is individual. Just keep that in mind. 

Tip 1: Don't be a jackass You are still at work, and you are still representing your company, rude remarks and vulgar jokes are out of the question. Act professionally like you would do at work in the company of those managers. Tip 2: Don't be a jerk to the staff Sure maybe the waitress and the cooks screwed up and put your pickles in at right angles when you specifically asked for them to be parallel, but don't be an ass about it, yelling about it and causing a commotion is going to look bad on you, even worse, it will look bad on your company. Tip 3: Avoid alcohol hic When ordering the drinks try to avoid alcohol, remember, still a work environment. The potential exception is if the managers also all do it, but even in that scenario, you know your limits, I hope, don't over do it, stick to one if you can. You still have to go back to work afterwards Note: Be wary of this, this is different in different cultures. If you are unsure of what is acceptable then play it safe and get a soft drink Tip 4: Red Lobster I don't know if the company is paying or if you are all paying for yourself. If its the former, then don't order something pricey just because you can. Order something that you would normally order if you were the one paying for it. You never know, you just might be, and you don't want to be stuck with a bill that you can't pay. Tip 5: Musical chairs, Where to sit This I can't really see as mattering much, it's just sitting for lunch. Just don't plonk yourself in a seat and refuse to move if two other people want to sit next to eachother, given you don't really mind where you sit its easier to just avoid confrontation. Everything you should be doing should paint a picture of you as a professional, smart employee who doesn't snap at the slightest thing. This is especially important in the company of your higher up's, acting a fool would be a bad career move. Tip 6: Loosen up, but not so lose that your pants fall off Don't actually loosen your trousers, this was metaphorical. Just relax and enjoy the lunch and probably reminisce about the employee who is leaving. Don't panic too much about the others there, they are just people too. Tip 7: Don't make it all about you, that's MY advice to you Sure you are now in the company of many higher ups and have the perfect opportunity to show off about what you've done to hopefully gain some attention. But don't. This lunch isn't about you, its about the employee who is leaving, keep that in mind. Tip 8: If you like it, put a ring on it. Engaging at lunch Don't think of them as 'Your team' and 'managers'. You are all employees working for the same company. Engage with everyone where appropriate, don't butt into conversations, but don't sit there silently and ignore everyone either. 

I would say the best you can do is ignore the email. Wish the directors a happy christmas if you see them and go on with your daily work cycles. If questioned by HR as to why you didn't contribute XXX to each director simply explain that you do not directly work with them and that your money has been spent on your family this christmas, but you hope they have a merry christmas none the less. Any company that would try to rebuff this by saying you have to contribute anyway is not worth your time and effort. You certainly shouldn't be working for them if they then insist the directors are more deserving of your hard earned cash than your own family. I certainly wouldnt be hanging around any longer than my notification period whilst I polished up my resume and interviewing skills! The other question has many good answers too. 

When I fill in my resume / portfolio I include all of the relevant work I've done. As a general rule of thumb the company will care more about the technical experience you gained from that endeavor than they will about the success of the project. There can be any number of reasons for a failed project, lack of funding, client is bought out. Client no longer wants the application. Your company goes under, cancelled for lack of other employees, cancelled because a new technology makes it redundant ect. There are a thousand and one ways it can fail that are out of your control. Not to mention you don't even need to say it failed, I've certainly never seen a resume that says "Worked on X for Y years for Z client: Success" ect. So I would encourage you to list all relevant experience, it's part of your job history and that knowledge doesn't just disappear. If asked about it in an interview then there is no harm in saying "This project was cancelled because of Y but dealing with these problems helped me learn X, Y and Z." Focus on how this had a positive impact on your career and show them that you can even turn failure into a personal success. 

Talk to the coworkers who are shushing you, maybe apologize for the noise but explain that it is necessary work talk. This should help ease things over and open up the conversation between the two of you about how you can meet in the middle. For example they could use headphones, or pop their head round and ask you to keep the volume lower (rather than flat out not talking) if you do get a bit loud. If the above doesn't work, or if you think it will not help and choose not to do it, then you might need to talk to your manager. Not necessarily to complain about the shushing but instead to express your concerns that sometimes conversations need to be had but this is distracting others nearby. Bringing it to their attention shows you are actively aware of the issue and are trying to find a means to get it resolved. Failing resolution you have now made record of the issue. If enough people complain they might investigate solutions (better soundproofing, more spaced out cubicles etc) Where possible try to take the conversation away from others. For example if the conversation might go on for a while or involves a lot of people, then making use of a nearby meeting room will at least stop your noise from distracting them for very long. If there is not a meeting room to make use of then consider if everyone needs to be physically present for the conversation. If not then it may be beneficial to have a conference call with everyone in it. Phones are very sensitive and good at picking up on low volumes so you are likely to talk quieter when using one, providing less distractions to those around you.
