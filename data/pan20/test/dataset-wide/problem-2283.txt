If you're using a campfire, some foods, like fresh-caught fish, don't require cookware. Just wrap in aluminum foil and cook in the coals. Fish or biscuits can even be cooked directly on the coals: scoop some ashes over the coals so they're not TOO hot, then place the food directly on the ashes. After it's cooked, just brush off the ashes. You should probably try this at home a time or two before you do it for real in the woods - personally, I find the gritty taste of ash (that didn't brush off) to be un-appetizing. Obviously, this won't work very well if rain is falling on your campfire. For cooking on a stove, check your local thrift store for a wide, medium-sized aluminum pot with no lid. Your food can easily pack into this so it takes very little space in your backpack. Use a sheet of aluminum foil for a lid. 

There are many disadvantages. The most important of which disqualifies this technology from any serious Blue Water sailing ... you can't tack. because of that you are at the mercy of the wind and that is a cruel teacher. The artificial center of gravity issues are for people that want to minimize heeling which a catamaran or trimaran accomplish. 

You obviously have underestimated the potential for danger, due to self admitted lack of experience on the water. As a blue water sailor for 50 years I strongly suggest you rent a car or take a cruise line as you will either end up in jail or swimming for your life to avoid being pulled under and chopped into chum by a prop. ...This come from a federally certified transportation manager as well as a sea captain with a perfect safety record. 

One 'pro' of certain digital altimeters: Even without GPS they can do a surprisingly good job of distinguishing between changes of elevation and changes of 'atmospheric pressure'. This means that you don't need to reset the altimeter to known elevations so frequently. The Suunto Core has this feature. It works by looking at the rate of change of pressure. If the rate is slow, it assumes it's just changes in the weather, and that the wearer isn't going anywhere - Barometer mode. If the rate of change is higher, it switches into Altimeter mode, and assumes that atmospheric pressure isn't changing. It's not perfect. If you're trekking over very gently-angled paths all day it would stay in barometer mode unless manually switched - and once in Altimeter mode, any weather changes will still affect the altitude reading (like a conventional altimeter). 

Packs are designed to carry the contents within a certain area. Extending your gear outside this area will cause you discomfort and will increase wear on the pack. I've never been able to attach more than a poncho or jacket onto the outside of an internal frame pack - such as this one. They're simply designed to carry everything on the inside. I would not attempt to tie a sleeping bag or pad to the bottom of this pack. If you want to attach extra items to your pack, consider an external frame backpack. Just be sure the load is balanced and your gear does not extend beyond the edges of the frame. I prefer an external frame because I can use it during all seasons. When it's warm, I use a compact 20 degree sleeping bag and everything fits inside. But during cold weather (October-December), I carry a -40 sleeping bag tied to the top and my tent tied to the bottom of the frame. I also have kids and have had, when they were little, as many as four sleeping bags tied onto my pack at one time. Maybe that's why my wife prefers an internal frame backpack :) 

Freeze protection - two basic areas engine and water tanks. Water tanks hoses, and fixtures can be protected two ways, evacuation of all water or mixing the existing water with polypropylene glycol or vodka. ONLY. It is EPA FDA safe...anything else is poisonous. Clear the bilge of water with a wet/dry shop vac. or add vodka. Engine. Clear water cooling apparatus from stem to stern of water or mix with polypropylene glycol or vodka only. Remove all water pump covers and let lines air breath if possible Automotive ethylene and di ethylene glycol is ILLEGAL. Antifreeze is ILLEGAL as it will be pushed into the water on startup in the spring and subjecting the operator AND owner to a $500,000.00US fine. Clearing water from fuel/water separators and adding fuel stabilizers is recommended. Change the oil in the spring. Using an unattended heater is NOT recommended to keep components from freezing. FIRES are very common with this approach. Element protection - depends on if you are hauling out the boat or leaving it at dock in the water. If hauling out then protecting the decks and scuppers from ice and snow fall as well as freezing drains in the cockpit or like areas is important. Some shrinkwrap the entire boat. A waste of money and material. if you keep the boat in the water you have to check on the boat periodically, and if there is potential for freezing a hull heater or an air bubbler or ice prop, to keep the ice from forming at the waterline and crushing the hull is necessary. 

Old cotton clothing and rags work very well at stopping arrows. Save those old tshirts, jeans, and socks that are too worn out to be used as second hand clothing. Stuff them into a burlap bag or cardboard box and use them as archery targets. That's what I used to do. I would stuff all of our old, completely worn-out clothing in a large cardboard box. When it was full, I'd tape it shut and use it for archery practice. When the box starts falling apart, just get another box and transfer the old clothing. The now-shredded clothing is still good enough to keep stopping arrows, but it will have settled a bit, so throw in some more old clothing and tape it shut again. I've only shot cardboard boxes filled with old clothing. I'm sure a burlap bag or those plasticy potato bags would work very well, too. I've only used cotton clothing. I don't know how other materials will hold up. Very important: This works just for field tips. Don't ever use broadheads on a target filled with old clothing. In order to remove your arrow, you'll need to unscrew the broadhead - which will require you to open the box (or bag) and dig (and probably get a severe cut). 

I know that's all bit of a leap, but if you had a problem our running in remote country and had to wait for rescue, having all your layers soaked with sweat is giong to be pretty uncomfortable. 

If you're out of the water and wet, you will lose heat by evaporation (as well conduction and convection), so dry clothing and dry body are important. 

It Depends. Actually, it depends on pretty much everything: Weather, terrain, fitness, group size, and of course, how long a day is. It's better to think of 'How much can I do in an hour, and how many hours do I want to walk/climb for?'. I'd start using Naismith's Rule. But, as you get experience about your own group's speed and fitness, adjust it up or down as appropriate. 

You have more time to spend doing other things. Meal preparation time can vary, for example, boiling water for some quick oatmeal is much quicker than making enchiladas or wild strawberry pie in a dutch oven (yes, I have known two backpackers that carry small dutch ovens and eat like kings). But still, it takes time to open your pack, set up your cooking gear, cook the meal, clean up, and repack. If you are busy doing other things, such as hiking or watching wildlife in the evening, then maybe this is a chore that should be eliminated. Not taking cooking gear reduces weight and gives you extra space in your pack for other things. However, this might be cancelled by the increased bulk and weight of the food itself, mentioned in con #6 below. Preparing your meals so that you can eat all day means you will be less hungry. Instead of having two or three big meals and a couple snacks, you can simply eat whenever you feel like it. Often, I feel a lot better when I simply snack all day. Buying a stove, and cookwear, and the just-add-water meals can get expensive. Not buying them and preparing simple foods at home can save a good deal of money. 

The manufacture's user manual will specify the SAFE number of occupants. If the actual number is not available the rule of overall maximum weight capacity / 200lbs yields the maximum number of people. Failing that information a cross comparison of an equivalent sized boat with the same layout/ features will be a good estimate. Canoes 2-3 max row boats 2-3. ... and Never more that the number of life preservers on board. 

The keel does two 'things' ... 'slice' ...it keeps the boat from turning when on a tack, in fact it is the reason you can tack at all. The other purpose is to offset the forces applied on the boat by the sails by leveraging the ballast against them. a skinny keel with a huge mass at the end will provide a better mechanical advantage. a long and deep keel will give you the best forward 'slice'. 

They are marked on OS 1:25K Explorer maps as "Byways open to all traffic". But it's a good idea to research your route beforehand as some (like the Monk's Trod) are now closed by traffic regulation orders - primarily because of the damage caused by off-roaders. 

I take a Primus EtaExpress stove with me when camping, and am slowing accumulating a collection of canisters with only around ~20% gas in them. With this little gas, they don't have enough pressure to be useful in anything except ideal conditions (hot, windless, and you have all the time in the world) but I'm reluctant to dispose of them. Is there a good way of constructively using up the remaining gas - and what's the right way to recycle the canisters when they are properly empty? 

Marine grade TP is a good choice for hiking. It is made to dissolve in water rapidly and contains little or no chemicals. Bury in soil and water if possible with stream water... this will also help keep from being tracked by predatory animals. 

Here is what a sailor with 37Kmiles of blue water sailing thinks ... the out rigger needs to have two properties when used with a canoe, floating displacement, keel side area. with out keel side area, you wont be able to tack, unless the canoe has a centerboard or a dagger board. a good general rule of thumb is an out rigger needs to displace at least half of the amount the main hull does in volume. two pieces of structural foam or just 2 inch pieces of home insulating will do fine. make a 1-2 foot keel and floating flat part that is 3/4 as long as the canoe, or just start with 8 foot lengths. like a "T". use 2x4/2x3 studs and rope. take it out and trim it ... relocate the mast and width as needed. you might need to add foam ... to bond the Styrofoam to anything use gorilla glue. it foams, pushes parts out of place. so clamp it.
