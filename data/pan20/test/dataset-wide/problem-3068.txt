The 2011 TV documentary by Radio Berlin-Brandenburg "Das preussische Gestüt, Neustadt/Dosse" (The Prussian Stud in Neustadt on the Dosse) about one of the oldest still existing main breeding studs and riding schools in Germany has a segment on horses during WW2: 

By the end of all this, with everybody lying about exhausted, this backwater named Macedonia comes about and sweeps up the lot. Including the Persians! ;) 

On the spur of the moment, I contacted, going first via Prof. Mary Beard, her husband Prof. Robin Cormack, specialist in Byzantinistic or, as Wikipedia states, he is a British classicist and art historian, specialising in Byzantine art. He was Professor in the History of Art, Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London, 1991–2004. Despite traveling in Turkey as I write this, he was kind enough to respond he writes: 

Is this a case of "other areas had one or more of the obstacles, but Germania had all of them and even more so"? 

What jumps out, apart from the appalling statistic, is that there were 3 million horses capable of being "drafted" into service. For comparison, the same program mentions that in World War One, the numbers were 1.5 million horses on the German side, of which also about 2/3 die. This at a time when the horse was still far more common and the country (and world) less motorised. Also, the performance demands are stunning to any equestrian - which would have contributed to the death toll: 70-150km a day is something even modern endurance horses have to work up to - with lightweight riders, super-modern light tack and saddles. Not with a heavy armed soldier on their back. Compare also cowboys and stockmen driving herds all day long, but wouldn't maintain this for long if they had to trot and canter non-stop (contrary to the Hollywood images - See also the TV trope Somewhere an equestrian is crying). 

Otherwise the city states used a crude form of bullion, which was quite impractical for anything but hoarding wealth: 

Note: much of this is source from the German Wikipedia, which doesn't have English equivalents for some of the quoted articles. This can be traced even further back to the late 18th and throughout the 19th century, when the German nations (there wasn't a single one yet) considered itself das Land der Dichter und Denker, as literary historian Wolfgang Menzel said 

Als die Deutschen weg waren (When the Germans were gone), by a consortium of German, Polish and Czech authors Historische Ansichten vom Sudetenland (Historical sights and insights of the Sudetenland), by Heinz Csallner Sudetenland in 144 Bildern (Sudetenland in 144 images), by Erhard J.

Pompey did die as essentially a refugee, with little means at hand. So, Seneca may be using a bit of poetic license to drive a point home. Whether Pompey was bankrupt due to having to finance the armies that were then wiped out by Caesar or he simply had no access to what fortunes he left behind - it's not like he could do a Western Union wire transfer! He couldn't bribe his way into the Egyptian king's favour either: 

Using the Wikipedia article as source, lances were indeed once-use items for shock attacks. If they hadn't splintered then they were sure to have gotten stuck, so they were intended to be dropped. This is with the heavy lances most people seem to have in mind, when they think of a charge by heavily armoured knights. However, anecdotal, I'm friends with people who are into reenactment of mounted medieval warfare. Mostly mounted archery, but they also practise with lances. Using the lighter and shorter lances used both before and after the era of the heavy knight, they practise "pokey pokey stab stab" while both holding on to the weapon, removing it from the target it got stuck in, getting it back into position to stick it into a new target. All this in full gallop or at least fast trot. The idea is to be able to hold the lance firmly in the moment of stabby-stab and then loosen the grip allowing the hand to slide along the shaft while riding over the target. Once past, with an again-tightened grip, you use momentum to pull the lance with you and out of the target. There's likely to be videos out there, but I'm only familiar with some of the ones they have on their Facebook group and from watching them during practise. Edit: to integrate some of the comments It should also be noted that, contrary to our image of the charging and heavily armoured knight (and horse) with long lances braced against the rider, this was only a late medi-eval development. Especially before the introduction of the stirrup, using shorter lances for throwing and over-arm stabbing - as used by Persian, Median or Gothic tribes - would have been not just more common, but rather the only way to exert thrust without Newton teaching you a lesson in physics. The stirrup changed much: it allowed knights to brace themselves for maximum forward thrust, it allowed mounted archers to stand in them to stabilise their aim. In all cases, the best horse warriors came from cultures in which it was trained "from birth". Even the Romans always remained an infantry: cavalry came from the Alae - the cultures allied with them. Any attempt by a non-equestrian to ride a horse in battle would end quickly and tragically. In fact, not even riding in battle would quite possibly end tragically, for horse and rider. 

Edit: I think I have to revise quite a bit. One thing is that the Peloponnesian Wars went through various stages which themselves got different titles (Ionian, Corinthian, etc). As a result the poster on Yahoo Answers may be quite right. In the Ionian War, which crushed Athens, the Persians provided the gold for the Spartan Fleet. In the Corinthian War, which pitted Sparta against former allies, Persia turned around and financed the other side. 

Post world war 2 immigration is considered the third of the major migration phases in Australia's post First Fleet in 1788, according to the Melbourne Immigration Museum 

and also, Hercules, in its Greek form Heracles, itself derived from Hera (wife of Zeus) and kleon, giving us Glory of Hera. Wikipedia gives the -anus ending as adoptive cognomen, meaning a suffix to indicate Diocletian would have been adopted (not unusual in the Empire). For those allergic to citations from Wikipedia, here also Roman Nomenclature 

Interestingly, it also became a path to assimilation for German Jews, which is why there were so many great Jewish scientists and engineers from Germany. Until the turn towards the idea of Blood and Volk around the turn of the 19th/20th century segregated German Jews regardless of how much they supported the Fatherland. 

κλεος makes an appearance in a number of other words, such as the latinised Cleon, and also the name of the muse Clio 

This paper offers an interesting insight: It wasn't just the value of the Persian gold, but also the simple fact of the existence of Persian coinage kept the wars going. It seems that only Persia had a silver coinage that was useful to be actually used as means of payment, including to be carried about! 

became the main supplement to make up for the purely infantry make-up of the legions. Meaning, we have no idea how those supporting allies would have afforded their horses and providing for them. 

However, at this time, cavalry riders had neither saddle, nor spurs, nor stirrups. Riding in that way is a challenge in any case, but fighting was a whole other thing. Yet, other empires managed, and the Romans found out the hard way the cost of over-focusing on their infantry and neglecting their mounted units. One was Cannae against Hannibal, the other Carrhae against the Parthians, both fielding larger and far superior cavalry units. The result was some of the worst defeats the Roman armies ever suffered. Still, the Romans continued to use their cavalry mostly as skirmishers and scouts. With the Marian reforms this reached its "conclusion" when the professional army virtually did away with the cavalry (and light infantry) leaving the Roman legionnaire of common imagination. The role of the cavalry (still skirmishing and scouting) was handed to those Alae who had proven to be good at it: e.g. Numidians and Celts. IIRC, I.Caesar also was fond of his Germanic mounted units. I think @Tom Au has a very good point in stating that, coming from a hilly, even mountainous area, cavalry doesn't become as dominant compared to the people from steppes or desert. Yet, we have mention of Cretan cavalry units as core auxiliaries - a rocky, hilly island! However, it's important to note that even after the Marian reforms, a Roman soldier would have had to own and provide for their own horse! Even if a common legionnaire in the new professional army would not have had to provide for their own armour. This puts a severe limit on the number of cavalry: only the wealthy, e.g. the equites could afford that expense. Goldsworthy makes a point that very little is known of the allies of this period, so that we cannot tell to what extend these were trained and disciplined. This in the context of how the auxiliares, such as 

I'll try with an answer as well, trying to be Solomonic between @Tyler Durden and @fdb. TL;DR: Yes, it's a coincidence. As @Peter Diehr lists from Behind the Name entry for Diokles the meaning is given as 

As you specified all of Europe, I thought I'd do a google on German "gut erhaltene Burgen" (well preserved castles). Select the Images result and you will find magnificent photos with specified locations. Many seem to be in Austria and/or Northern Italy, just from a glance. There's also a Wikipedia article on Castles in Germany, which seem to display some well-maintained ones. Though also many that went through the refurbishment and altering that you bemoaned in England. Also, give TripAdvisor a go, of all things. You can find entries like this: Burg Eltz. Once again, apologies, it's in German. And finally, Quermania's list of best preserved burgs and castles. I'm afraid you'll have to dig through the German entries to find to what extent they have preserved their original character as defensive constructs. 

The cavalry was organised into something called quingeniary (500 strong) and milliary (1,000 strong) forces. Contrary to infantry they were called alae instead of cohortes. A cavalry quingenary ala had 16 turmae of 32 men for a total of 512. Milliary units had 768(!) in 32 turmae. That's actually nothing to sneeze at in numbers compared to a legion. But the role remained support, scouting and skirmishing. There is a whole chapter on Equestrian Officers under the Principate and its not easy to pick what to quote. The equestrians became a more important order than under the Republic, specifically to obtain their loyalty to the emperor instead of any senatorial family. Augustus even created equestrian governors. It's likely valid to ask just what connected these equestrian to actual cavalry, but the fact remained that they were "wealthy enough people to afford and ride horses and their provender". Goldsworthy states that 

The title of the book sounds French, so I'd either have to brush up a lot on my rudimentary knowledge or some other kind soul, fluent in French, can provide information from that book. 

Prokopius' book Buildings of Justinian, a translation of which was kindly linked to by @user2448131 gives a detailed description of the Hagia Sophia, its construction, and its beginnings post Nika revolt, but does not make any mention of pagan "foundations". As for other historical source, there seems to be a distinct dearth when searching on that topic: there are many sites or excerpts with circular quoting referring to the pagan temple. This one stating 

Which is one of the few that actually identifies the deities. As a number of other sources state Greek temple, we'll have to presume that would have been Aphrodite? Here is a most intriguing abstract about the construction of the Hagia Sophia. It was actually designed by a pagan! Sadly the site requires registration and acedemic credentials.

This question is extremely interesting to me. It's been part of an ancestry research project of mine. My paternal family comes from the Sudetenland, but sadly, with the recent passing of my dad late last year, the last first hand source in my family is also silent. I will try and fill in this answer over time, which might be a bit unusual of an approach. But I have 1500 pages of books and documents that I need to go through to give a proper answer that isn't just lines on maps. Besides if nobody is interested I don't have to worry about adding reams of info later on. ;) I'm not even going to bother with Wikipedia (English or German editions) so see at the bottom for sources. To begin, Sudetengermans originated in ancient Bohemian and Markomannic tribes mentioned all the way back by Tacitus. Together with their Slavic neighbours, Czech tribes, they ended up inside the Habsburg empire in around 1526 (5, page 7). The term Sudetengerman ist actually very young and was coined early in the 20th century to align with Alpine Germans and Carpathian Germans, i.e as another German group living in mountainous regions. In this case the Sudeten mountains in the northern ranges of the then Habsburg empire. (5, page 14) The term was collectively used for Germans from Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian-Silesia. When the Habsburg empire disintegrated after World War 1 and Czechoslovakia was founded, the Sudetengermans found themselves inside a new Slavic country. Despite the Wilson doctrine, any attempts at autonomy, self-determination or integration with Germany failed. (5, page 14) Union with Austria would have been geographically absurd (look at a map), though not strictly impossible, as there are and have been precedents. Strictly speaking, they wouldn't have belonged to Germany either! No more than Austria or Switzerland do. But, just like Yugoslavia, you knew this wasn't going to end well. Oh, and that's the German-speaking view. In all fairness, the history from the Czech view varies: from their POV large areas had been left ununhabited when entire tribes moved westward during the migration periods. However it's not debated that in these specific areas near the Sudeten ranges, German-speaking ethnicity was in the majority. As is too common, who was the oppressor and who the victim changed with who was in control of the overall area. With the German-Austrian Habsburgers ruling, the Sudetengermans were top dog. When that ended, the Czechs became the Bad Guys, cracking down (sometimes violently) on any secession attempts, or even increased autonomy. To answer the main question from the OP: as so often the was no fixed border. With ethnical lines far more fluent than drawn on a map, where a German majority became parity with Czechs and then changed to Czech majority wasn't discrete - and probably depended on who did the counting! With the perceived or real oppression experienced it's no wonder that the Sudetengermans welcomed the invasion of the Hitler's forces with open arms. Nor is it a wonder, after the horrors of Nazi occupation, the Czechs wanted the Germans gone, who were guilty by association at best and perpetrators at worst. However it shouldn't be forgotten that with 2-3 million Sudetengermans being kicked out, the approach of the Communists rulers who took over in the late 1940s was to simply uproot about 1.9 million Czechs and simply tell them to now live in the vacated areas. Or else (1, page 15). That was still "simpler" than what happened in Poland, where the entire country was shifted westward. Stalin typically held on to what he had opportunistically gained in 1939 while still allied with Germany, so instead of giving it back he handed Silesia to Poland, kicking out millions of Poles who then had to pack up and head westwards.
