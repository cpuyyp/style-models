This is an out there solution but may very well work. Automotive stores sell seat belt pads, they velcro together. From what I remember they aren't too pricey and I know for a fact you can get a pair in Brazil. This is what I'm referring to. $URL$ Best of luck and I hope you are able to figure something out! 

Down is the lightest and most compressible delivering the best warmth. Down is the undercoating of water fowl. It provides the greatest amount of dead air space of any insulation material for its weight. A down pod consists of light, fluffy filaments that grow from one quill or point. These filaments intertwine and mesh, forming air pockets which trap air. One ounce of goose down contains 23,000 pods and two million filaments. It comes in different Fills ranging from 450 to 900, also be mindful that manufacturers may also only put 70% down and 30% other insulation...The best are usually 90/10. They also come with different weights for example the Patagonia Nano Puff is probably one of the lightest down jackets, then you get into something like a Mountain Hardwear Nilas, and then last but not least an expedition weight parka like the North Face Himalayan Parka. Here is a Buying Guide that may help you with your decision. 

Where I am from it costs $60CAN to get your climbing shoes Resoled by a professional. Alternatively, you can try yourself with a KIT that costs $35CAN. However this $35 does not include a knife, sandpaper or acetone to clean the shoe/rubber and does not account for labour, in other words your time taken to repair your shoes. Ultimately to me it seems to be about the same cost however here are two examples: 

In Ontario where I live and do most of my climbing the routes are not clearly marked. Guide books also lack clear approaches and thus it just turns into a big guessing game of what route you're on and what grade it is. With a new guidebook for Ontario in the works I was thinking I may approach the authors and suggest we mark the routes more clearly. I have climbed at crags that have numbers written with what appears like black paint or tar on the rock face; another example is at Muir Valley in Red River Gorge, Kentucky they use engraved coins at the base of each route. Some Spanish crags have a loose rock engraved and placed at the base of the route. What is the most eco-friendly/sustainable approach to marking routes with the least impact to visual scenery...I personally do not like painted numbers as it ruins the view, the silver coins used in Muir Valley are much less noticeable by hikers. What are some other ways of marking routes? I'd like to consider: 

An embolism in a medical context refers to any large moving mass or defect in the blood stream. An air embolism is an air bubble trapped in a blood vessel. When an air bubble travels along an artery, it moves through a system of blood vessels that gradually become narrower. At some point, the embolus will block a small artery and cut off the blood supply to a particular area of the body. For example, when a person scuba dives with compressed air, they take in extra oxygen and nitrogen. The body uses the oxygen, but the nitrogen is dissolved into the blood, where it remains during the dive. As one swims back toward the surface after a deep dive, the water pressure around decreases. If this transition occurs too quickly, the nitrogen does not have time to clear from the blood. Instead, it separates out of the blood and forms bubbles within tissues or blood. It is these nitrogen bubbles that cause decompression sickness. For venous air embolisms, death may occur if a large bubble of gas becomes lodged in the heart, stopping blood from flowing from the right ventricle to the lungs. However, experiments in animals show that the amount of gas necessary for this to happen is quite variable, and also depends on several other factors, such as body position. 

The answer depends on your sccenario, if you have access to an ice bath/cold shower within minutes of your activity that is your best bet as Liam has stated above. However, if you are unable to have an ice bath/cold shower directly following your activity there is an alternative. Some of us may have to take a bus home after the gym, drive our car, or simply where we are partaking in strenuous activity has no showering facility! What you need to do is get to a bath/shower and use HOT water for 4-6 minutes, after that you are going to switch it to as COLD as possible for as long as possible, usually thirty seconds to two minutes. This was explained to me by my cousin who is a doctor, I asked her the same question and unfortunately the climbing gym I frequent does not have showering facilities. The hot shower loosens you up again gets the blood flowing and then the sudden cold is the purge/re-oxygenation of the muscle tissue. It is worth a read. 

I currently use La Sportiva WildCat Trail Running Shoes size 43 for trail running/light hiking and Nepal EVO's size 44 for Ice Climbing and Alpine adventures. The Nepal EVO's fit me perfectly with a good midweight sock and using their additional tongue for the left foot which is slightly smaller than my right. I am looking at purchasing La Sportiva Olympus Mons EVO's for high altitude such as Denali and other real cold expedition type adventures that require a double boot. My question is how much larger do I size them to accommodate for the swelling of the feet at high altitude? Would one full size be ok? I am thinking a half size for thicker sock+ sock liner and a half size for the swelling of the foot, is this accurate or should I be sizing up even larger? 

I have an MSR Elixir 2 tent with footprint that is great for my spring/summer/fall rock trips and is made of quite durable fabric. It has worked quite well at very cold temps and has very effectively kept rain out. I am hoping to use this tent for weekend ice climbing trips during the winter months. The only issue is that the fly is silver/white! I have reflective guy lines but am wondering: Is there a bright coloured tape, preferably orange, that I can apply to a portion of the fly so it is more visible in snow during daylight and also has some reflective properties so it is visible at night? Reasons for wanting to do this is to save ~$750 on a four season tent until I actually need one! There may be hunting permitted in the area the tent is pitched, emergency situations where we would need to be identified from the air... Also please consider that the tape or markers need to accommodate the stretch in the fly. Does any such product exist? 

There are several different layering systems find what works for you and try everything on in store. If you would like to purchase something online and cannot find the same model to try on in store, at the very least try on some gear from that same manufacturer to get an idea of their fit. Try contacting a manufacturers retail store close to your location and inquire about their return policy. For example I know in Canada I am able to buy North Face from their website, have it delivered to my home address and if it does not fit I can return it to the retail location in my city no questions asked. 

I currently use MEC Humboldt paddling gloves for cycling in warm/cool - windy/wet weather as they offer better protection than my thin runnning gloves and are not as hot as my winter gloves. My issue is when I wear them the second or third day in a row they are still wet on the inside with my perspiration. 

I marked my single rope so I can find the middle when rappelling and also to give my belayer a warning when I'm on a route of unknown length. I am going to purchase a set of half ropes soon for some Mixed/Ice Alpine Routes in the Rockies and am wondering if it is a good idea to mark the middle. I'm only wondering because rappelling you just tie the two together so no need there and if doing running belays and making your own belay stations in an alpine setting a middle mark warning to the belayer doesn't seem to be of concern. Do Half/Twin/Double Ropes get Middle Marked? If so, why? 

You need to remember and account for the diameter of your prussik, which following the general rule of thumb, is at least 2mm less than the rope diameter. A 5mm (Static,Tech or Nylon) prussik supplies a good amount of grip. If you chose a rope of smaller diameter your prussik will be approaching some very small diameter cord. A 7.5mm such as the Sterling Escape Tech provides good abrasion resistance, and has the ability to withstand falls, something a rope of smaller diameter may not be able to provide. Any smaller than 7.5mm the rope itself will be difficult to ascend, and if you chose to descend on it the rope will have a tendency to coil up and even knot itself. 

When on extended outdoor excursions are there any scenarios where you can leverage urine as an efficient tool? An example would be: You're in your sleeping bag in a tent and it's -30*C outside, you opt to urinate in a nalgene inside your sleeping bag and place the sealed nalgene at your feet to keep your toes warm. I would like to emphasize practical uses rather than concocting dubious scenario's that ultimately are not beneficial to the readers of this question. 

AND if you want to get real fancy get a Vapour Barrier Liner and use all three together for expeditions and temps below -30C. You now have all your bases covered! This is much more cost effective than to buy a summer bag, your -15 bag, and an expedition bag... If you're too cold in the overbag but too hot in the -15C mummy bag, try playing with your layers, add a base layer top and bottom while in the overbag, or even throw on a nano puff or fleece top...there are many ways to regulate your body temp. Vests are a great way to keep your core warm but your arms still feel nice and cool. I hope this helps! 

For winter camping it is recommended to use a sleeping pad with an R value greater than 5. Can you alternatively use two closed cell 2.5R pads one on top of each other? If using an inflatable pad with an R value of 5 and a closed cell with an R value of 2.5 will you effectively have a 7.5R value set up? 

Warning: Wave the flashlight back and forth to signal a warning to those around you. Use this signal when you spot a potential danger such as a wild animal, steep cliff or unsafe terrain. OK:Point your flashlight toward the ground, holding the flashlight by your side. Draw a circle on the ground using the light emitted by your flashlight as a pen. Use this signal to inform those around you that everything is okay. Distress: Three flashes in a row will generally indicate to any onlooker that you’re in need of help. You can also use the Morse code signal for distress, which is three short blasts, three long blasts and three more short ones. 

I currently use All Purpose Krazy Glue to repair pinch flats on my road bike inner tubes. All it takes is one drop over the bite and it seals it perfectly, works every time and holds 95 PSI for weeks with no leaks! Recently I lost a pull tab on the back of my LaSportiva trailrunners. I figured I would Krazy Glue it back on however when the drop landed the shoe smoked, the fibres melted and turned rock hard as if they were burned, which is most likely what happened. I am curious, does anyone know what Super/Krazy Glue is appropriate to use on fabrics if any? I understand the re-attachment of the trail runner tab is a pretty ambitious task. What I would really like to do is put a drop over a small tear in my winter gloves, attach new leather to the palm, small tear on tent... Does anyone have success using Super/Krazy Glue on Fabrics/Outdoor Gear? 

My personal recommendation would be to use Super/Krazy Glue for any small "cracks" in the rubber. I have successfully used it on rubber and it is quite effective! for the slightly larger holes than cannot be filled using a liquid glue, I would recommend the following: Apply a Gore-Tex or similar patch along with some "Shoe-Goo" or similar product. **After you have applied your patch and goo you can always add a layer of super glue over the top for added protection. I would not recommend using a bicycle tube patch kit as they are very weak and my personal experience with them has only been awful. I actually now use Krazy Glue on any pinch flats, it has saved me a lot of money and not to mention has worked flawlessly! If Krazy Glue can hold 110PSI of air inside a thin rubber tube, I am almost positive it will keep the water out of your boots! **Do not get the Krazy Glue on the Gore-Tex patch, it will destroy it! Krazy glue can be used on rubber but it will destroy any fluoropolymer such as Gore-Tex! 

I cannot say if there are standard signals between mountaineers, however from hiking I know the following three light signals are used: 

Outdoor research has a good return policy I have dealt with them before. North Face has lifetime warranties and accepts returns, conveniently at retail locations even if purchased online. Also take a good look at MEC they have a great return policy and are a Canadian Co-op, they have great sales and mostly free shipping, if not it is very reasonably priced. Alternatively, you could try layering and use your soft shell such as: Base layer+merino+fleece+softshell. It won't be as light/compact/warm as a single 60g Primaloft One Mid-Layer but it's worth a shot in my opinion. Play around with it and who knows you might find something that works for you! 

Put Heat Warmers in your climbing shoes and in your gloves, put a big puffy on. Jumping jacks, lots of jumping jacks, get your heart rate up and get your blood flowing and warmed up. Climb, the first climb is always the worst! Keep a heat pack in your chalk bag. You'll freeze on the wall but when you get down you'll be hot! Immediately throw on your puffy and keep warm. Climb two will feel like it's 30C out :) 

A stitch and glue boat hull is made of plywood panels assembled with fiberglass tape. Contrary to traditional boat building in which molds define the hull shape, in stitch and glue, the hull panels define the shape. Another major difference with wooden boat building is that the framing of a stitch and glue boat is made of fiberglass.
