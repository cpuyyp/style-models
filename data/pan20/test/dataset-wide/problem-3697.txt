The $P \ne NP$ problem is the best way we know to formulate the belief (which was expressed even before the problem was formally stated) that certain specific algorithmic problems (such as finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph) requires exponential number of steps as a function of their description. The formulation is based on the important notion of a nondeterministic algorithm. The conjecture that P is not equal to NP is the basis of a mathematical theory of complexity which is remarkably beautiful. It is likely that a proof for the conjecture will lead to better understanding of the limitations of computation which will go beyond the conjecture itself. (Unfortunately we are very far from such a proof.) A counterexample (which is not expected) may lead to a major change of our reality and not just our understanding of it. (I suppose this is one of the main reasons in believing the conjecture.) Your concern is that maybe, because of the asymptotic nature of the conjecture, we can question its real relevance. Namely problems we regard as intractable may still be even if P=NP because of huge constants in the polynomial involved, or perhaps even if NP not equal P there can be efficient algorithm to relevant cases of intractable problems. These are serious concerns that are often raised and sometimes there are efforts to study them scientifically. Overall, it looks that these asymptotic concerns are secondary compared to the problem itself. Moreover, there are many examples that the asymptotic behavior and practical behavior are similar beyond what the theory dictates (but a few examples also in the other direction). There are other related concerns regarding the relevance for the $P \ne NP$ problem. Is the worst case analysis relevant to practical problems? Is the hardness apply when we are interested in approximate solution rather than in exact solution? Both these questions (like the asyptotic issue) can be regarded as secondary in importance compared to the $NP \ne P$ problem itself but otherwise very important. Indeed both hardness of approximation and average case analysis are very central research topics. (A side remark, there is something unnatural about the way Graham's numbers are used in the question. You are dealing with a decision problem where the answer is always yes when n is sufficiently large. And there is a simple polynomial time algorithm as a function of n to decide the answer for a every given n. So the relevance of this particular example (which is interesting) to the question asked about NP complete problems (which is also interesting) is not so strong.) Finally, regarding relevance. Andreas raised the interesting possibility that NP=P but the constant involved are so huge that the poynomial algorithm for solving NP complete problems is utterly not practical. A related interesting possibility is that there even exists a practical polynomial time algorithm for NP complete problems but that finding this algorithm itself is computationally intractable. As I said, both these possibilities are considered unplausible. Even if true they will not harm the relevance of the NP=P problem in making the central distinction between intractable and tractable problems. In order to make these concerns interesting one should come up with a theoretical framework to study them, and then study them fruitfully. (As I mentioned above, this was done for related concerns regarding approximation and regarding average case behavior.) 

Is it true that D has a directed spanning tree T, T is a subset of E, such that E-T is also a directed spanning tree and reversing the orientation of each edge of T results in a strongly connected digraph? update: The answer is NO as pointed out by an example by Maria Chudnovsky and Paul Seymour, who also pointed out additional necessary conditions. A remaining question is: Problem: Find a characterization of directed graphs $D$ that has a spanning tree $T$, such that $E-T$ is also a spanning tree and reversing the orientation of each edge of $T$ results in a strongly connected digraph 

4. Activities for national math society There are, since early times, regular annual meeting of the Israeli Mathematics Union and some other local activities. 5. National mathematical journal There was a substantial effort, again from early times, to create and maintain an Israeli journal of mathematics. (In the 40th there was even a professional research level journal in Hebrew for a few years.) 6. Conferences and visitors. There was, again from early times, some resources devoted to conferences and visitors. Carefully administered and with attention to the added value for the local people this can be very fruitful. Arranging visits of top people in mathematics for lecture series and visits can also be useful. It seems that it is a good policy (when the country is not rich) not to over-pay for such visitors (among other reasons, because this set standards which push the cost of visitors in general too high.) Of course, warm hospitality is priceless. 

There is an algebraic method by Alon and Tarsi which allows in certain cases to prove that certain graphs are $k$-colorable (in fact, even $k$-choosable). A famous case where this method prevails is to show that a graph on $3n$ vertices consist of edge-disjoint union of a Hamiltonian cycle and $n$ triangles is 3-colorable. This method can potentially show that graphs of cubic planar bridgeless graphs are 3-edge colorable which is equivalent to the 4CT. (So far it allows only to derive 3-edge choosability from the 4CT.) (I suppose that various other speculative algebraic methods were proposed over the years. For example, I myself proposed to approach 4CT by finding algebraic/topological conditions for the existence of "Tverberg's partitions.) 

The cone of positive semidefinite matrices is a fundamental example of a convex cone which is important in convexity and for convex and semidefinite programming. The Reuleaux triangle is the first and most famous example of a set of constant width other than the circle (or ball in higher dimensions). 

The word "stable" is used in many different contexts. Also "elementary" has many usages. The word "lattice" has two entirely different meanings which are ar time confusing. So is the word "field". I have two more: "deterministic" refers sometimes as "not random" and it is also a central concept in computational complexity where "non deterministic" has another meaning (very different from random). The word "classical" is used in various confusing ways. 

Yes. If this is a good research level question it will will be impressing and if not it will not harm. 

(Unfortunately it is not the only missing lemma needed to prove this conjecture.) The paper by Kahn and myself contains an easy proof of a much wealer version of the lemma, where $1000 \log n$ is replaced by $C_\epsilon n^\epsilon$ for every fixed $\epsilon$, where $C_\epsilon$ is a constant depending on $\epsilon$. Motivation 2 The second item on the motivation list is is why the problem might be doable or even easy. For a monotone increasing family F of subsets let $a_k(F)$ be the subsets of F of cardinality k. There is a theorem of Kruskal and Katona that gives a complete characterization of sequances that can appear as $(a_0(F),a_1(F),\dots,a_n(F))$. The Kruskal Katona theorem gives a numerical characterization. It also asserts that every such sequence can be realized by very special families: the k-sets in the family are initial with respect to the reverse lexicographic ordering. It is easy to see that the answer of our problem for a family F depends only on $(a_0(F), a_1(F), \dots, a_N(F))$. So, in principle, a positive or a negative answer to the problem should follow from the Kruskal-Katona theorem. A related paper with several open problems by Michel Talagrand. M. Talagrand, Are many sets explicitely small? 

The asymptotic quantum Birkhoff conjecture by Smolin, Verstraete, and Winter was disproved by Haagerup and Musat. The following paper $URL$ presents the state of the art and gives some references. 

Hyperbolic geometry, which led to the understanding that there are non Euclidean geometries and to many other developments. 

$$\max (|A+A|,|A\times A|) \ge \frac12 |A|^{4/3} (\log |A|)^{-1/3}.$$ This sum product-relation by Solymosi is one of the highlights of additive combinatorics. Sum-product theorems have many recent applications. Here $A$ is an arbitrary set of positive real numbers and $A+A=\{a+a': a,a' \in A\}$. $A \times A=\{a \cdot a': a,a' \in A\}$. Let me add two other important formulas from additive combinatorics. The Cauchy-Davenport relation $$|A+A| \ge 2|A|-1.$$ And the Plünnecke relation $$|A+A| \le C|A| \implies |kA-\ell A| \le C^{k+\ell} |A|. $$ 

To make this question and the various examples a more useful source this is a designated answer to point out connections between the various examples we collected. please indicate only strong, definite, nontrivial, and clear connections. 1) The Petersen graph is obtained by identifying antipodal vertices and edges in the graph of the dodecahedron - one of the five platonic solids. Such an identification gives a polyhedral complex realizing the real projective plane. Applying this operation to the icosahedron leads to a 6-vertex triangulation of the real projective plane. 

1. Immigration Israeli mathematics was initially based on and had benefited all the times from immigration of mathematicians to Israel. The ability to absorb immigration, in general, and to attract and absorb immigrating scientists, in particular, is crucial.(Keeping the relations with mathematicians who immigrated from Israel is also an important issue.) 

Some extensions of the Gallai-Sylvester theorem, while still applying only to configurations of points are in the spirit of the problems described above. See the following papers 1) B. Barak, Z. Dvir, A. Wigderson, A. Yehudayoff Fractional Sylvester-Gallai theorems, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2012. (Link to a journal proceeding.) 2) A. Ai, Z. Dvir, S. Saraf, A. Wigderson Sylvester-Gallai Type Theorems for Approximate Collinearity Forum of Mathematics, Sigma, vol. 2, 2014. See also this blog post on fractional Gallai-Sylvester. 

For background to this question much recent exciting related things, see this videotaped lecture by Alexander Gaifullin. Consider a triangulation $K$ of a two-dimensional sphere and consider maps from the vertices of $K$ to $R^3$. A one-parameter family $\phi_t$ of such maps is called a flexing if the distance $d(\phi_t(v),\phi_t(u))$ is constant whenever $v$ and $u$ are adjacent vertices. A flexing is trivial if it keep the distances between every two vertices. We can extend the maps of the vertices linearly to a map from $K$ considered as a geometric simplicial complex to $R^3$. When $\phi (K)$ is an embedding we can consider the solid body $L$ inside it. The following fundamental facts are known: 1) (Bricard) If $K$ is the boundary complex of the Octahedron then there are maps of the vertices of $K$ with non-trivial flexes. (However when you extends linearly these maps to $K$ this is no longer an embedding.) 2) (Gluck) based on Alexandrov and Stainitz) A generic map of $K$ to $R^3$ is rigid. 3) (Connelly) There are embedded flexible spheres 4) (Sabitov) The volume of $L$ along a flexing of a sphere is constant for every flexing. (This extends to the case where we don't have an embedding by regarding the volume as a signed sum of volumes of bounded complements of the image of $K$.) I would like to know what else might be fixed for flexing of 2-spheres into $R^3$. Q1: (Perhaps this was asked by Bob Connelly) Are Dehn-invariants fixed for a flexing. In other words, are two embedded spheres along the flexing scissor-congruent? Q2: Are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian of the (silid 3D-dimensional) body constant along the flexing? Q3: Are lengths of closed geodesics in $L$ constant for a flexing? Explanation (Added later, see Joe's comment): Here we consider $L$ as a 3-dimensional Billiard "table" and by "geodesics" we refer to billiard paths. (Of course, positive answers to Q1 and Q2 would be a far-reaching if not far-fetched extension of Sabitov's theorem, and Q3 is also rather far-fetched.) I don't know the answers to Q1, Q2, Q3 even for the known examples of flexible spheres. I dont know if Q2,Q3 can be extended to the non-embeddable case but I suspect Q3 could. 

Two remarks: First, even when mathematicians do make a conjecture, there are various possible interpretations of what it means. In fact, this is the case even for different conjectures made by the same mathematicians. In this letter Shmuel Weinberger described five different meanings for what "a conjecture" is, referring to different conjectures he had made. (Here are two: "On other times, I have conjectured to lay down the gauntlet: “See, you can’t even disprove this ridiculous idea.” On yet other times, the conjectures come from daydreams: it would be so nice if this were true.") Second, it is often the case that an affermative answer to a problem made by X is referred to "X's conjecture". Often this is justifiable, and reflects the real intention of X. (But sometimes, it causes some problems.) For example, what was referred to as "Borsuk's conjecture" (at least from the late 50s) was a positive answer (which was expected by Borsuk) to a problem posed by Borsuk in a paper from 1933. 

I use the second definition. I do not really understand the first definition; Can you write it in concrete terms? (Hatcher's object are nice and allow more "economical" triangulations.) It is correct that you need sometimes many simplices for triangulating (but only 7 for the torus). But the original simplicial complex definitions have various advantages. Abstractly simplicial complexes are just hereditary collection of sets. Namely collection of sets closed under taking subsets. These are very basic combinatorial objects that appear all over the place. 

Here are three examples from combinaorics: 1) The Frankl Wilson' theorem (The paper can be found here). This theorem in extremal combinatorics has a large number of amazing applications: Explicit Ramsey constructions, applications in combinatorial geometry; applications regarding Shannon capacity of union of graphs and many more. 2) Trotter-Szemeredi The result by Trotter and Szemeredi regarding the maximum number of incidences between points and lines in the plane had remarkable applications including one discovered by Elekes' to the product-sum theorem. 3) The mod p product sum theorem by Bourgain-Katz-Tao had many surprising applications in many directions. (One reason for the wide applicability is that when you multiply matrices sums and products mix.) 

2N Noncollinear Points Determine at Least 2N Directions, by Peter Ungar. This is a beautiful short paper that proves the result in the title. A general remark: If you have to choose a single paper (or a single paper of a mathematician selected in other answers), I would recommend more strongy to choose original papers of important basic results rather than large survey papers or "meta" paper about mathematics. (This is also closer to the original intention of the question.) 

Update:(Dec 2017) The ICM launched a new website. All previous ICM proceedings are available here $URL$ . However I cannot find the old page with access to individual papers and search options. Just recently the International Mathematical Union (IMU) put online all the previous proceedings on the ICM's!!! Here: $URL$ (update:broken) . This webpage is based on joint work by R. Keith Dennis (Ithaca) and Ulf Rehmann (Bielefeld). So you can read for free all the articles (Including Hilbert's famous problem paper; Martin Grötschel demonstrated it at the opening ceremony of ICM 2010). I dont know when the proceedings of ICM2010 will be added. UPDATE: the 2010 articles have now been added! Update The ICM2014 papers are available here (you can download each of 4 volumes; the IMU site does not contain these papers yet.) As for the talks themselves there is a page with all the ICM 2010 plenary talks here $URL$ links for videos from earlier ICM's (plenary talks and other events) can be found here $URL$ Update (August, 6 2014) Many (46 for now) of the ICM 2014 proceedings contributions are already available on arXiv, via this search. (I got it from Peter Woit's blog.) Videos of lectures can be found here. Update (May 2014): Starting 1992 there is also every four years the European Congress of Mathematics (ECM) that the European Mathematical Society (EMS) is running. The proceedings of the first three ECMs are now freely open. These volumes are available at $URL$ (Digitising the proceedings of the first three ECMs, published by Birkhäuser was a task carried out by the EMS Electronic Publishing Committee.) Starting with the 4ECM (2004), the Proceedings are published by the EMS Publishing House. The EMS decided to make them freely available online too. I expect that this will happen soon and I will keep you posted. Further update (June 2014) The ECM Proceedings are now available on $URL$ I was told that in a few months, the EMS will put also the 6ECM volume.
