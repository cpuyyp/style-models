I'm looking for a way to prevent people to send emails to anyone but a whitelist of trusted contacts / trusted domains. Currently we're using an outlook macro to achieve that, but i'm wondering if there's a way to do this within Exchange ? WE're urrently using Exchange 2003, but are planning on upgrading to exchange 2010. Maybe this feature already exists in Exchange 2010 ? 

Someone told me one day : "Dress for the job level you're trying to reach", and it must be one of the best advice I've ever heard in my professional life. 

I'd recommend that you check appdeploy.com for informations on how to silently deploy your software. Most of the time you'll find here informations on how to extract an MSI from a .exe installer if it is supported by the installer. For instance, with the msn example : $URL$ 

There's a GPO setting to automatically logoff "disconnected" sessions after a period of time, that way people can leave their sessions idle but still connected without the fear of being disconnected, and people just closing their RDP client will be correctly disconnected. 

You sometimes may have to host your own mail systems because you need to be able to know exactly where you data is, geographically speaking. It happens a lot in the banking world. 

I think that Forefront client security (server equivalent of MS security essentials) should be the easiest thing to implement on server OS $URL$ 

The greyed out Edit button may be caused by rights issue, make sure that you have the correct permissions to edit the GPO. To see the users who'll be affected by this GPO, check the "security filetering" groups. the users in that group should be affected by your GPO (provided the're in the correct linked OU) 

Another method to separate the output would be to run one tomcat instance for each webapp. This way you can not only separate the webapp logs, but also the other log files, the JVM parameters, start and stop of the instances and so on. You'll find a step by step guide here. 

because the number of connections is ip bound in most browsers, you can spread your content across multiple ips/domains to enhance performance. you can find a more detailed explanation at yahoo. there are also some more performance tips for your frontend performance. a good tool for messauring frontend performance in firefox is yslow. it does not only messaure performance, but also gives hints about how to improve your performance. 

I hit the same bug #1231541. As I had the problem in OpenStack, I used packer to rebuild the image and change the order of the cloud-init modules. Afterwards everything worked as expected. 

when your first sentence is not a typo, just add a connector for http on port 8080 and add the redirect as you described. you can't have http and https listen on the same port. so let http listen on port 8080 and https on port 8443. 

you have two virtual host configured for 188.40.153.185:443. This confuses apache and he only accepts the first one. You should merge these vhosts or change the ip for the seconds vhost, depending on what you want to achieve. Or if your are using name based virtual hosting (possible with ssl, but not the best way) you need to add a directive as one of the error messages says. 

The only answer I can come up with is to create a new site collection for the sites that require the security. Your new problem is who will be the admin for those sites, which at best is something that is granted and taken away as needed, and at worst is done by someone unqualified for the position. Besides site collection admins, how to you keep the farm admins out? Then you are back to the answers already provided about the level of trust you must put in your admins. 

There are a number of ways to do this. Be sure you choose a supported method so you don't have a nightmare upgrading to 2010 when you get around to it $URL$ Look at the first option for creating your own site definition. I don't think you want to copy the whole server over, I think you want to package up your changes and deploy them as features on the production server. Please note this is not coming from an experienced voice, but this is our plan when we finally customize our install. 

The clean solution is to investigate writing or buying a redirection webpart. Bamboo seems to have one that would fit your bill. You could also hack a CQWP to do the same thing in a less elegant but still works manner. On your Kickoff page 

Make your library read only. Create new permission level that only allows add but not delete and not edit. You could also make a custom workflow with SharePoint designer that will automatically move a document from the insecure "drop box" library to a more secure library on all items that are added. 

I may be mistaken, but you can try to add a -i parameter, so that the process you're trying to launch will run in an interactive mode in the specified target computer. Edit : I just saw what you're trying to acheive, and I don't think you can acheive that with psexec, which is used to execute process on remote computers. Here, you may what to try an application presentation solution, like Xenapp or Windows 2008 remote desktop services 

If you want to troubleshoot this kind of issue, you can try to setup the userenv.log file with high details, try to login, wait a bit and then review the userenv.log file. You should be able to see what is stopping your login. More information here : $URL$ 

In the "Citrix connection configuration tool", you can prevent the client printers to be mounted by editing the ica connection --> clients settings --> uncheck "Connect client printers at logon". There's the same configuration option in the rdp connection, you can configure it from the same tool. The connection configuration tool can be accessed from the citrix server, in the administration tool menu, or by using the ICA toolbar. 

I read recently some news about how MS will have to hand over data to the US government if they asked for it. ( $URL$ or $URL$ ) Some of our clients could be concerned by that. MS does have european datacenters, but i was wondering if anyone knew if these datacenter could be targeted too ? 

You can either use the DISM utility from the WAIK to inject drivers to the WIM file, or there's a gui to do that (check $URL$ ) 

because your site offers sensitive data as you mentioned, it should be encrypted. Of what type are the design flaws? Is it possible to implement redirect rules for https to overcome the design flaws temporarily? 

yum has no option to do this. and i don't know about a plugin which could this. but when you have time and fun with scripting, it should be possible to do it with yum commands. 

afaik, it is not possible with pure rpm. rpm provides this only for installed packages with option . when you can use yum, try to search in the repository. 

as already mentioned the connection is not leaving the server. but you should try to avoid using the http request for performance/design/... reasons. when the source is in the same app/webserver, you should access it directly without doing the detour over http. 

Call both commands with the same block size: (for both commmands). Perhaps they have different configurations. 

as long as you have swap space available, there is no need for the os to free swap space. It will be freed when there is no space left. Bu when you get in this situation you definitely have a problem. 

i think your ssh login fails and then directly goes to the radius authentication. what happens when you enter a radius passwort? when my guess is correct your auth should fail, no matter whether you enter a correct or false password for your radius auth. to debug this problem a bit more, please post your debug output. you should disable your radius auth to be sure your ssh auth is working. 

You can try to change the wireless connexion metric, to an higher metric than your wired connection. This way, your wireless connection default route will always be used if you're connected to the wireless network. 

You can try to set the proxy of IE to a fake proxy, and add the website you want your users to access in the exception list of that proxy ? that way, no data connection at all, except for the website you choose. Cost : zero ! 

You can have most of this using the PFsense firewall distribution. It allows you to easily setup a captive portal, manage a proxy for the users, block them with firewall rules. All is configurable through an easy to use web interface, and if you want more advanced features, you can always go deeper with command line. And all the hardware you'll need is a cheap computer with a wireless network card :D 

In my case, we install updates at 4am, in order to avoid impact on any users, even those working a bit late. If you have a good monitoring system that warns you if a problem occurs, you should be able to fix it early in the morning, before even going to work. 

To avoid the google redirection, just use $URL$ , it will direct you to the google.com website even if you're located in another country. 

We can't really do our job correctly without scripting, and sometime these scripts can be difficult to create / debug with only text editors I'm currently using UltraEdit or Notepad++ as text editors and scripting platform (syntax highlighting is almost mandatory), but I was wondering if there was a more advanced scripting environment, an IDE of some sort, for VBscript and Powershell mostly ? (like always, free is better, but if the tool is really good I'm not against paying for it) 

Ensure our criteria for deleting a site are met (business rules like site age, inactivity, lack of purpose, expiration date reach, etc) Contact the site owner and get a response in writing that we will delete their site Backup any data Confirm any groups created in the site aren't being use by another site (learned this the hard way) Check the site usage report (if inactivity is the issue) Confirm any alerts on the site are invalid Confirm no sub sites are available or needed. 

We are looking to create a knowledge base system in our regional office. We have tried to convince the national office to purchase add-ons to our help desk software, but so far it has fallen on deaf ears. If we begin our own KB, the last thing we want to do is spend time migrating data manually, so are there free KB systems with robust export tools? The nebulous nature of the question is because we don't know if national will ever choose a system, so we don't have a target import to. As we gather requirements on our team we feel being able to dump the data and massage it into another system might be a good idea. Right now we are gathering requirements, so anything goes 

As we are writing our governance plan, I am not find many examples of SOPs for deleting a site. We are a small operation and will want to review each delete manually, so what are the gotchas to consider before pulling the plug on a site? My thoughts are: 

I'll have to deploy virtual machines on demo laptops, which will use Vmware player, but I've got some security concerns, as some data stored in the virtual machines are a bit sensitive. Is there a way to prevent the copy of these virtual machines ? Are the virtual hard drives encrypted, and if not is there a way to encrypt them ? In short, is there a way to lock down everything so that nobody could copy and or use these VMs in another computer ? EDIT : Truecrypt to encrypt the VM could be a solution, but if the password used by truecrypt is leaked, then it becomes useless. Associating the VM with a computer so that it can only run on a specifica hardware should do the trick, but I haven't found a solution that allows me to do that... 

I've got an SQL database on an azure VM (non domain) that i'd like to backup to our internal DPM 2012 server. I've installed the DPM agent on the Azure VM, setup DCOM to use only the ports 5000 to 5025 on both the VM and the DPM server, created the 135, 5000-5025, 5718 5719 endpoints on azure and on the VM's firewall. When trying to add this agent to the DPM server, I end up with an error, "Unable to contact the protection Agent on server .cloudapp.net" I know there is some sort of connection between them, as using a wrong password gives me an Invalid Credentials error. The error seems to be DCOM related : When trying to connect to the Azure VM from the DPM server using VBEMTest, i get an Error "0x800706ba The RPC server is unavailable", but access is deneid when using wrong credentials ) What am i missing ? Has someone been able to achieve this kind of setup ? Thanks for your help !
