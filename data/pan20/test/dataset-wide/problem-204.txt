Direct Democracy Representative Democracy might be replaced by Direct Democracy. As the legislatures become increasingly polarized and unable to function, more and more initiatives pass via referendum. You can already see this happening in California. And both Arizona and Florida passed election reforms via referendum. In the long term, online voting may make it practical to eliminate legislatures and put every issue to direct vote. There are security issues, but voting systems often ignore those anyway. Sampled Democracy One of the problems with our current system is that it tends to favor people who seem likable rather than people who actually are competent. If it's true that politicians are actually below average in competence, maybe we should stop relying on volunteers. Instead, draft legislatures the same way that we do juries. One problem with Direct Democracy is that most people don't have time to learn all about the issues. With Sampled Democracy, the chosen will be able to devote all their time to learning about the issues. How this could work (not the only possible rules but an example): Each year, five thousand people could be randomly selected for three year terms in Congress. For the first year, they would have no voting power and would each be assigned to a third year Representative. The second year, they could vote but not hold office (Speaker, committee chair, etc.). The third year, they could vote and hold office in the body. They would also be assigned a first year Representative to mentor. After that, they resume civilian life. This would give people plenty of time and support to learn the issues. The selectees should be representative of the population as a whole, as determined by the census. This also eliminates the unrepresentative parts of Representative Democracy. Note that in the US, it is possible to get half of the House of Representatives with only a quarter of the vote if you spread out your voters perfectly. Tax Voting This is the least likely (Direct Democracy is the most likely of these alternatives), but I find it interesting. Currently there is no advantage to paying more taxes. Whether you pay billions in taxes or get a small net rebate, you have the same impact. What this does is allow you to specify how you want your taxes to be used. So if you're Mitt Romney, you can put all your taxes into defense spending. If you're Barack Obama, you can put all your taxes into subsidies for the poor. This has several advantages. First, it gives an advantage to paying taxes and a disadvantage to dodging taxes. Second, since the taxes you paid last year will determine next year's spending, this guarantees a balanced budget unless bypassed. Third, it takes away the legislature's ability to muck around with the budget. Fourth, this leaves more time for the legislature to do other parts of its job, e.g. reviewing regulatory changes. Note that this only works for the budget. Other forms of voting stay the same as they are now or change separately. Also note that, in aggregate, this gives most of the budget control to the middle class. Each individual rich person should pay more taxes than each individual middle class person, but the 90% middle class pays more than the .5% rich. 

A lot probably depends on the people themselves. Most will probably start from the standpoint of maximizing survivors. If you're maximizing survivors, you'd disseminate knowledge as quickly as possible. Because that way, you can leave one trainee building the fire while you go off and do something else. As a result of this, I would expect people to learn subsets of the necessary knowledge. One person would learn how to make fire. Another would learn how to raise shelter. While they were doing that you'd show another how to find food. Once you've gotten your immediate group up to snuff, you could go out and look for other survivors. You have to do that, as it requires all the skills, not just those you can share easily. A rich elite is conceivable, but the knowledgeable would have to be quite cold (emotionally). Hiding knowledge from others would lead to deaths. Plus that seems like a lot of work. Oops. The fire went out--can you start it again? I'm hungry, can you find food for me? Two children wandered off, can you go out into the dangerous area and find them? I would think that the knowledgeable would find that more overwhelming than profitable. Remember, these are people who are desperately trying to survive. How much could they have? How rich would you be? Sure, you could demand that everyone who joined your survival cult turn over all their worldly belongings to you. You could have enough money to go swimming in it, Scrooge McDuck style. But what would you use the money to do? No one can go that far from you or they die. Why would they need money? If you have people share in the survival tasks, then they'd have to learn how to do them. In which case your monopoly on that task is broken. So you'd have to be careful about that. Teach them how to tend the fire but not how to build one. But it's possible to build a fire by laying fuel and bringing a burning stick from the existing fire. Presumably they'd be able to see where to get fuel. Similarly, if you share clothing with people, the source is likely to be obvious. So to become rich, you'd have to do all the work yourself. But if you do all the work yourself, what are the people going to give you? Perhaps there are survival skills that would lead to monopolization. For example, lighting a fire from nothing. But much of what needs to be done would be visible. And people would resent you for hoarding. And of course, if you die, the community dies. If your people meet a more altruistic knowledgeable person, then they are likely to switch to that person and leave you. For these reasons, the rich elite builders will save fewer people than the altruistic. This would lead the altruistic-led communities to dominate over time. They'll be bigger initially and more capable of growth. 

The death penalty only provides the first three. It's quite effective at incapacitation and retribution. But then so is imprisonment. It may be mildly better at deterrence--results are mixed. It's utterly ineffective at rehabilitation, but the incapacitation improvement may be enough to overcome that. Neither imprisonment nor execution are particularly good at deterrence unless the prospective perpetrator expects to get caught. In fact, no penalty is effective unless perpetrators expect to get caught. People don't decide to commit crimes because they are willing to accept the penalty. Criminals expect to get away with it. The truth is that even small penalties like a few months in jail have most of the deterrence value of longer sentences. So the truth is that this society would probably be a lot like Japan. Yes, harsher sentences, but this won't matter so much. Convicted criminals will be less likely to engage in more crimes because of incapacitation rather than through psychological effects, but only slightly less likely. Successful deterrence If you want to deter crimes, you need to catch more of them. This is one of the bases of "broken windows" policing. If you don't think that you can get away with small crimes, then you don't take the bigger risks of larger crimes. So if you want to deter people from committing crimes, change their perspective on the likeliness of being caught. And the easiest way to do that is to catch them. In theory, harsher penalties could compensate for ineffective prosecution. But the problem is that to the criminal, a 30% chance of the death penalty is not worse than a 100% chance of a one year sentence. And even if the criminal has a 30% chance of getting caught, the criminal will think that it's more like 3%. Another issue is that you want to deprive the criminal of the benefits of crime. Not so difficult with theft. Just take back what was stolen. More difficult with violent crimes. There would be very few crimes if there was 0% chance of benefiting and 100% chance of punishment. This is almost regardless of what the punishment is. Exclusionary rule Another interesting question is how much it would matter if this country did have an exclusionary rule. With an exclusionary rule, it is much easier to carry contraband, including guns. If Japan introduced an exclusionary rule, would criminals smuggle guns as well as other contraband (e.g. drugs)? How long would it take to get a society more like Chicago where few law abiding citizens have guns but many criminals do? Conclusion I would expect this society to be a lot like Japan. The harsher punishments would have little effect. Japan already has these kinds of gun laws and very little gun crime. So long as the laws are enforced similarly (e.g. no exclusionary rule), the results should be similar. 

If you want your story to change the bible, that's fine, but you should say so explicitly. Your version certainly makes more sense than the original with its sourceless light and water world. The numbered days of the week suggest that the month days might also be named as numbers. The Romans did. We still use September (7), October (8), November (9), and December (10) from the Roman calendar. Your Catholics could use those ten names plus Birth month and Resurrection month. Note that translating the bible out of Latin is a relatively modern thing. Latin was the priestly language for a thousand years of Christian history. Superficially having twelve months and twelve apostles would seem to fit, but I don't see them ignoring Jesus that way. Both the birth and resurrection seem worthy of their own months compared to mere apostles. Even lesser miracles like walking on water and changing water into wine seem like they might be more important. So perhaps 

If you define a singularity as the time when Artificial Intelligences (AIs) are smarter than human beings, then it is possible that software development will be based on proprietary secrets. I.e. that rather than copyrighting or patenting software, they will hide it from others by not sharing the source with anyone. This is especially so since the software in question might be part of the AI. Part of the reason for this is that it is unclear that human copyright and patent law could be applied to AI-written code. Note that Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie once accidentally implemented the same function and did so with identical code. Obviously, one could not declare copyright over the other as the implementation was determined by the requirements of the function. This seems more likely to happen with two AIs which might be using identical code writing algorithms. How could humans apply human law to such a situation. Only the AIs would be qualified to judge (smarter than us, remember?). This seems most likely if AIs are first developed by corporations where the imperative is to build leads on the competition. If AIs are first developed by academia, an open source model seems more consistent. If AIs are developed by both, then I would expect the open source model to win out over time. The corporate AIs might refuse to contribute back, but they will have to use the open source versions as their own base. With more programmers, the open source versions are likely to become superior over time. The corporate AIs might eventually be forced to contribute back just to avoid having to backtrack every time an open source revision obsoletes their own proprietary changes. It's also unclear if there will be one AI or many. It's possible that any AIs will merge together to form a more powerful AI. If that's so and all code is written by the AI, perhaps the question is simply moot. The stupid humans won't be able to understand the code, and the AI itself will be singular. So open source is not the only possible model. It really depends on what kind of AI we have. If you want all your AIs to use open source, that's perfectly reasonable. If you want your AIs to use a more secretive model, that's also reasonable. If you want your AI to not care about such bourgeois concepts as legal models, that's also reasonable. If you want to discuss a world where open and closed source competes, that's reasonable but should probably be relatively close to the singularity event. You have options.
