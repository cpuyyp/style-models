A map manuscript of the world by the monk Cosmas Indicopleustes (Cosmas "the one who sailed to India") survives today: Wikipedia describes the map as follows: 

But according to Cyril of Alexandria in the 5th century, St John Chrysostom was labelled as the "over-thrower of the temple of Diana". Suggesting that he was responsible for the temple's destruction. A similar mention is also given by Proclus of Constantinople who says "In Ephesus, he despoiled the art of Midas". This may allude to the temple of Artemis. Do we have a definitive answer as to when the temple was destroyed? 

So it was Demetrius and Phillip's threat to Roman occupied Illyria and also to Italy itself which prompted the Romans to intervene militarily. 

You can see by the actions of Demosthenes how much of a hindrance one man under the influence of Persian gold could be. He had convinced the Athenian assembly to send an army with allied Thebans and Boeotians to meet the Macedonians at Chaeronea and be decisively beaten. This resulted in the destruction of the city of Thebes and the end to the conflict which brought most of Greece under Phillip's control. 

Officially, If you were a Muslim in Greece, you could be exempt from compulsory deportation if you were: 

I recently came across an article about the Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocattis and learned that he wrote about the reunification of China by Emperor Wen. I also know that Cosmas Indicopleustes wrote somewhat about China 60-90 years earlier than Simocattis. Were their any historians in the Greco-Roman world that preceded the two above that gave anything more than a mere mention to the societies of China? 

With the alliance in place, the Romans would have to further stretch their forces and resources to the east so as to counteract any possible Macedonian offensive. The Macedonians had numerous things to gain from the defeat of Rome: 

Here is a byzantine mosaic map. The city at the bottom (ΙΕΡΙΧW) is Jericho and the Sea on the right is the Dead Sea. I wasnt able to find a source of this map. 

The article does not list a source for this information and i cant seem to find any further information about it. Is there any evidence Hagia Sophia was built on the foundations of a pagan temple? 

So as for sources "testifying the existence of Macedonia" Yes there are plenty of sources mentioning a "Macedonia" but bear in mind that between the 7th -19th centuries, the definition of "Macedonia" had changed significantly. From a Roman province, to Byzantine Theme, to Bulgarian region, to Latin region, to Serbian region and so on.. As for sources "testifying the existence of ... Macedonian people" The best you'll get are minor references to people from the region regardless of their language or ethnicity. 

To add to the first answer, there is no single registry of athletes who performed in the Olympic or various other pan-Hellenic games. I am sure though that there have been attempts by modern researchers to compile such a list. In Sparta today you can see on the main street a monument dedicated to all the past Spartan Olympic victors to the present day. I took a photo of it when i went there in 2016. Name of Athlete - Contest - Year (π.Χ is BC and μ.Χ is AD ) 

I can find a city by the name of Trun in France, but I can't find Chambios, let alone where this "Cauldron" took place. I was really hoping to narrow this down to a particular address or field, but I have no experience with this kind of thing and understand that this might be a bit optimistic. 

I'm neither a history buff not an artist, so I apologise in advance for my poor descriptions. I have recently come into possession of a painting depicting some naval ships, perhaps 19th century, sailing towards a coastal settlement. 

My late grandfather, through whom the painting came into our family, was a member of the German Luftwaffe, stationed in Bavaria and Italy for most of the war, until his capture in 1943. I suspect he would have acquired the painting before then, but I can't really be sure. I believe the painting was gifted to him some time in the 1930s-1940s, and since this occured during or near to a time of war, I have to consider the possibility that it may at some point have been war loot. I would like to be able to; 

Identify the scene being depicted Identify its painter, and Identify or guess at its origins, and return it to the decedents of its previous owners if it came into our family by unethical means. 

The painting is inside a 100x70cm frame. I can't make out the signature, but have taken a photo of it: 

One of my interests is attempting to understand what human experiences were like for individuals in the past. I want to learn about their day-to-day lives, their fears, their aspirations and what their world view was. Does a field of study which attempts to document and convey human experiences across periods and demographics exist, and what is the name of this field? The closest I have been able to find is social geography, but that seems to be a rather poorly defined field with little emphasis on historic experiences. 

I am trying to document my grandfather's participation in World War II, and have come across a letter written by a German military official informing my grandfather's parents that their son is missing in action. The letter refers to the location of his last known whereabouts as "Kessel von Trun und Chambios" on the 18th of August, 1944. I can only assume that this was in the vicinity of the western front at the time. My grandfather's next correspondence was from a POW camp in the UK, but I don't know whether he encountered US or British forces (or other, for that matter). I would like to know, as precisely as possible, where this took place. Kessel von Trun und Chambios translates to the Cauldron of Trun and Chambios, presumably in reference to an encirclement by allied forces at the time (although I don't know this for sure). Here is the contents of the letter verbatim, with the names of my grandfather and his father replaced with XX and YY respectively, and with notations in parentheses. The letter is dated 2nd of December, 1944: 

Mark Tauger's 2003 analysis of the Bengal famine, which has been used by Madhushree Mukerjee in her book on the famine, in fact does actually bring to doubt the contention of Amartya Sen in his 1981 work that there was sufficient food supply before the Bengal famine, or was at least comparable to what was available in 1941, a non-famine year. Sen has stuck to his position, expressing a certain annoyance and causticity in his responses to both Mukerjee and Tauger, stating the musings of an 'unnamed plant biologist' to be the source of the data who actually turns out to have been S. Y. Padmanabhan who later headed the Central Rice Research Institute, and had worked in Bengal during the famine. Amartya Sen also seems to imply doubts on the the data from "two rice research stations" at Bankura and Chinsurah quoted by Padmanabhan and Tauger, as if a rice research station would not be a reliable source of data at all. The data cited in Tauger's paper actually seems pretty convincing, detailing the differential effect of the fungus on the yields of 21 varieties of rice in 1941 and 1942 at these two stations. The simple fact, however, is that the damage from a natural disaster like a a fungal crop infestation would follow a distribution pattern with peaks at one or more places - the simplest distribution that could be fitted to it would be a Normal or Gaussian distribution. Even two points on the map being off the projected yields by a large amount would significantly alter the analysis, since we are dealing with a distribution here, and not just one or two blimps on the map. Here is how Amartya Sen responded to Madhusree Mukerjee on The New York Review of Books. "Madhusree Mukerjee seems satisfied with little information. Mark Tauger’s data come from exactly two “rice research stations” from two districts in undivided Bengal, which had twenty-seven districts. Since weather variations have regionally diverse effects, it would require more than this to “seriously challenge” the analysis I made, using data from all districts, which indicated that food availability in 1943 (the famine year) was significantly higher than in 1941 (when there was no famine)." However, when we are dealing with a distribution, the data of yields of rice varieties in 1941 and 1942 cited by Tauger (given by S. Y. Padmanabhan in his 1971 paper on the famine) from Bankura and Chinsurah, separated by around 150 kms, would, in my opinion, be sufficient to prove that Sen's analysis would be significantly off the mark, since these two widely separated stations cannot just be two exceptional points or blimps on the map. They are a part of a distribution spread over a large area. Of course the data from only two points cannot map out a whole distribution, and at that time it seems that there were only two such rice research stations recording data. It could still be argued that the distribution would have complex local variations and that it cannot be mapped with data from two points. Sure there would be local variations, but not to the extent of reducing these two stations to just two stand-alone peaks on the map. The probability that these two widely separate points are exceptional points in the distribution of a fungal infestation over a large area would really be very very minuscule. Tauger at the start of his paper summarizes the two views on the causes of famine as follows "Thus,admittedly with some oversimplification, the theories of famine divide into two categories, On the one hand, one view maintains that famines result from an overall decline in food availability in a region or country, a shortage, usually because of a natural disaster that destroys crops, and in a context of overall low food production. On the other hand, several other approaches argue that famines result from a variety of economic, social and political factors and contexts that reduce or deny access to food for certain people and groups in the country under consideration." Amartya Sen's thesis is that it was not insufficient supply, but other factors - hoarding, high food prices, the cutting of supplies by the Japanese, the requisitioning of ships and boats by the British, British imperial policy of confusion and callousness, among other things that caused the Bengal famine and the deaths. Sen's analysis, of course, does not exculpate the British administration, on the contrary as he points out in his reply to Mukerjee on The New York Review of Books, it does precisely the opposite. The actual cause would of course be a combination of all factors including the shortage, the callous indifference or even outright hostility of Churchill and members of his government, and including all the factors stated by Amartya Sen. However, whatever the causes, that timely intervention - entirely within the powers of the colonial administration, could have prevented the death of millions is beyond any dispute. That Winston Churchill and his government played a major role in preventing this intervention has also been established beyond doubt by Ms Mukerjee. Whether his actions were motivated by a racist or imperialist attitude and a hostility and contempt for Indians that found frequent expression in his remarks or by his overwhelming single minded dedication to the war effort can be a matter of debate. The truth probably is that it was both.
