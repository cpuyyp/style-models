Guilds were not formed by individuals, but by working cultures. Their backdated claims of venerability are pretty indicative that they formed as a group exercising economic and political power. Burghers, or "the bourgeoisie," acted collectively to establish town and city charters, market rights, and guilds. The advantage in a feudal economy to allowing this to occur, was that guilds provided access to goods and services that were not otherwise available in the feudal household or through direct extraction from peasants. The benefit of guilds to the nascent bourgeoisie was standardised income setting and clear markets (avoiding gouging that would be a detriment to all members of the market). Additionally, as bourgeois households were directly reliant upon their production and trade, beggaring your neighbour would beggar those who married your daughter (or in some cases, your daughter herself). Mastery of arts wasn't a key component, as many journeymen and apprentices had the capacity to conduct the work. Mastery is about the capacity to establish a household in a free city. There was no original master craftsman. In the feudal fashion, groups with a shared capacity for violence (ie, in the case of guilds, urbanity) banded together to enforce their views on the rest of society (largely by claiming that they had ancient freedoms), and then subsequently claimed that things had always been that way, at least as far back as anyone could remember. All of the venerability was invention. As proletarians did not exist, there was no difference between "trade" and "labour" guilds. The idea of a single individual originator isn't valid when dealing with economic history. 

For commodity whiskey prior to transportation: 50c a gallon $URL$ For 4 distilled whiskey $1 a gallon. Assuming that Whiskey could be locally produced in most areas, this seems like a good price. Now let's get a labour price: $URL$ $0.02 an hour for 1790 for "production workers." I think this is a reasonable assumption Assuming a 6 and a half day week of a 12 hour day (not unreasonable, see Thompson, Making Engels, 1844 etc.) that gives us a weekly of 78 hours. But of course we need to subtract Saint Monday. (Thompson, Time work discipline and industrial capitalism, P&P): 66 hours. 66x0.02= 1.32 a week. Or between 2 gal 3 pints and 1 gal a week. 

Ethnically differentiated rulers regularly reduce the status of the majority population, and often these peoples are constructed as racially identical in terms of late 19th century racial theories. See the Norman dominance over a predominantly Anglo-Saxon population in England for an example. (Here comes the new lord, slightly more Frenchified than the old lord). For an example that uses the racial constructs from the 19th century exactly, wouldn't $URL$ match your interests? Obviously neither the population of Rus nor the Mongols perceived of themselves in terms of 19th century racial categories. Finally, societies that are perceived to be largely ethnically homogeneous regularly reduce the status of their own members, see the tribal crises of antiquity, or the regular internal subjugation of peasants into serfs, or the vast emiseration of the English working class during the period 1750 to 1850. This is class war as usual. 

While this answer is based off theoretical work that applies strictly to wage labour, the insights presented are also relevant for "petty commodity production," or, the situation where a large peasantry is producing simultaneously for market as personal consumption. Or where Thompson's "plebeians" are in receipt of wages, but not structured as wage labourer (ie: where the wage relationship isn't centrally determinate in their class experience). Marx strongly asserts that workers consume their entire wage bundle immediately; that the wage bundle is socially determined (by class war, of course) and may fall below subsistence or rise toweringly above it; and that the commodities that make up the wage bundle only have a tenuous link with their embodiment of value (same as the previous, but value centred rather than use centred). This holds true even for savings, which Marx and Engels address in relation to deferred unemployment consumption, or self-pensioning. (The distinction can also be seen later in Volumes II and III in terms of the difference between Departments IIa (consumption by workers, necessities) and IIb (consumption by capitalists, luxuries). Although this division is arbitrary, it is arbitrary on the basis of the difference between wage and profit; the wage being entirely consumed, profit being split between recapitalisation and consumption). If we proceed from this, to a conception that the peasant consumers of mass sugar were in an imperialist relationship with a prefiguring "factory" and unpaid proletariat in the Americas, this all becomes clear: sugar became cheap on the rent of zero waged slave labour. This is demonstrated in the Autonomist tradition, see Federici (cite follows) at 225, "The tribute which the Spaniards exacted was much higher than that the Aztecs and Incas had ever demanded of those they conquered; but it was still not sufficient to satisfy their needs. By the 1550s, they were finding it difficult to obtain enough labor for the both the obrajes (manufacturing workshops where goods were produced for the international mar­ket) and the exploitation of the newly discovered silver and mercury mines, like the leg­endary one at Potosi." Manufacture of goods on a speculative basis for sale as a commodity was occurring. Thus the "virtuous" cycle of capital reinvestment of the value form could proceed apace in the Americas, with the "degradation" of free labour to wage labour occurring in the middle passage. Cheap sugar was built on the backs of slaves; but, the reason why recapitalisation happened in sugar was that production was developing on a capitalist basis in the colonies. For more evidence see the position of the Sugar lobby in Britain as a separate lobby from the corn and manufacturers lobby. 

WWII was an ideological conflict between different imperial power blocs within international capitalism, and in a few instances with colonised powers with local bourgeois who wished to be imperialist. Chiefly, the capacity of existing blocs of capital to sustain themselves and their growth reached limits. 

Economic history's great attempt to produce a great price/wage series for Southern England's monasteries, agricultural labourers, and modern workers failed. It leaves us with the series used by Measuring Worth, but the series is untrustworthy: 1) Wage labour was not generalised until the 19th century, this makes "wages" and "prices" meaningless. 2) Series construction raises great problems 3) The reliance upon southern English monestaries' as a record source means a poor generalisation even to people in receipt of wages of account; and cannot really be generalised out to the surrounding local markets. So there's no way to reconstruct a wage price series beyond 1700 with any confidence. 

Using Jairus Banaji's lovely Theory as History (Haymarket/Brill) he goes into depth into the role of early capitalism in reinfeudating Poland. (First four chapters iirc). The Eastern Baltic ended up being the granary of Western Europe. This put pressure on landlords over a long period of time to extract the maximum cash / good-as-cash that they could from those beneath them. (Note: not profit, their interest was raw volume.) The destruction of local credit would have been part of the reduction and degradation of peasant households towards subsistence and the formation of the "large estates." Genuine distress in the scene appears to be felt by the tailor and the tradeswoman. The others are still, in some way, beneficiaries. Which is strange because this is a colour block print, so I'd assume aimed more at village and town recipients than peasantry. Also, it's curious as to who'd fund this propaganda. 

The idea can't be validated, given that it rests on theoretical constructs that are fundamentally language based, and moreover empirical. It could potentially be invalidated. Firstly you need a theoretical construct that defines "liberality" "illiberality" "left" and "right." The most common theoretical construct underlying the left-right divide is the issue of socialisation of the means of production, either under workers' control or through nationalisation within capitalism posed as a "left" condition; with the untrammelled conditions of the market (moderated by socially conservative institutions) posed as the "right." This spectrum has a two hundred year history, more or less, and is commonly understood with Roux and the Montagnards of France being the definitional case of "the left." Other views are possible, consider perhaps the "Nolan chart" whose constructs are less firmly embedded in schematic political science, but whose conception of a scale of personal freedom amounting (largely) to personal liberality versus social conservatism may fit. You would then need to assign parties to the scale over time. This could be done by looking at their intended policies, their implemented policies, or the actual social effects of their implemented policies—three very different things. I would suggest political, social and economic history here. Finally you would need to compare the party movements to your posited example. I would suspect from the classic "left-right" scale that both parties in the United States have been moving right, as they have both attacked social welfare institutions, supported the right of the market to dominate and exploit proletarians, union busted, wound back social programmes and are usually given as the definitional examples of neo-liberalism in practice. Correspondingly the time-linked access to share of the economy (ie: wages and social benefit income) of proletarians in the United States has shrunk since the 1960s compared to profit shares; and, those previous professionals who were paid extraordinary wages have become increasingly reduced to proletarian statuses. From this relatively common perspective both parties in the US have moved from centre-right to hard right, with the difference being made up based on their varying positions regarding the legal and economic position of women, ethnic groups, racial groups and glbti people. 

For a number of reasons Bolshevik inspired revolutionaries perceive that two "revolutions" were necessary in 20th century society: a "democratic" revolution to fulfill the bourgeois revolution's political aims, and then a socialist revolution to place "the working class" into power. From the ideological perspective, Castro's actions look informed by this "two-stage"-ism still present in Bolshevism's attitude towards backwards bourgeois, colonial or semi-feudal states. Installing a "bourgeois-democratic" president prior to moving forward was seen by bolsheviks (cf: Central Europe's integration into the soviet system) as fulfilling the democratic revolution. There was a strong desire to meet these ideological formalisms by bolshevik inspired revolutionaries, partly because of the strength of ideological binding that bolshevik type parties endured. Partly because these parties were often isolated from working class experience and fixated on ideology instead of practice. There are a whole set of major problems with these conceptions. Chief, in my mind, is formalism in that bolshevik inspired revolutionaries read apparent signs about state formations as if they represented substantive economic relationships. Putting some chap in power and calling them Prime Minister doesn't mean that the working class has now started developing a solid critique of an ideally functioning bourgeois state. Revolutions aren't made by parties (even if parties are essential to making revolutions); and they're not over in a nice neat package after 9 months. Ask the Mountain or the Gironde if changing a formal element of government resolved a revolution. From a raw power perspective it looks like sensible consolidation by a Prince.

Why did The Crown give assent to Apartheid legislation during the 1950s? For example, the Reservation of Separate Amenities Act, Act No 49 of 1953 was assented to by the crown. The relevant law in the 1950s was the South Africa Act 1909 as amended by the Status of the Union Act 1934. HV Evatt describes the situation as being that the Crown, being the King or Governor General, could only act on the advice of their ministers. (HV Evatt 1936, The King and His Dominion Governors, 298-300) 

Expanding Tom Au's answer: "Homosexuality" as we know it is a product of 19th century medical science which ties together a sequence of sexual, emotional, family and social conducts and gives them a new name. We should remember that the conducts we think of as a behaviour "homosexuality" were not necessarily perceived of as a unitary conduct in past societies. That element of theory out of the way: People who did not marry, and had property to transmit through marriage, would be disciplined by their family or society. This strongly incentivised marriage, and in many agricultural communities marriage was practiced as male to female only. The reasons for male to female only marriage are a combination of reproductive and property based. While he is incredibly out of date in this regard, Engels provides an engaging description of human marriage in Family, Private Property and the State. It is worth it to the extent that Engels notices that the family and marriage are conditioned by other social phenomena. Marriage was an economic institution (oikos: household). It brought male, female or child labour into the household or established new households. There was, therefore, regulation over marriage and strong economic incentives towards marriage. Sexual and emotional conduct outside of marriage was often perceived to threaten the system of marriage. In part this is because sexual conduct outside of marriage leads to children, and children can be used to form households. Emotional conduct outside of marriage has been perceived to lead to sexual conduct (even courtly romance notes this), and this can lead to the getting of children. And the getting of children can lead to non-ideal marriages from a property standpoint, or to other problems. However, sometimes marriage can produce what we now analyse as "homosocial" situations. Monasteries. Warrior cults. Female household networks. Or the structure of the family (patriarchal absolutism say) gave certain people the power to configure permissible sexual expressions outside of marriage. Also, it is worth noting that officially sanctioned violations of the cultural traditions above existed. Elites often displayed power by violating cultural norms that applied to others. These complex configurations of gender and sexual expression, when expressed as a continuing culture, can be linked to property. But specific moments have more complex causes than simple one to one links. The historical position of conducts like forming strong couple bonds, households, marriages, reproductive, economic or sexual relationships are bound up in property, family and gender. Some accounts of post-19th century homosexuality emphasise this in the connection between the "nuclear" family and imperialist capitalism. 

Not all manuscripts are actually manuscripts. It depends on the cataloguing that the archivist, librarian or records officer has done. Often manuscript is used as a short-hand for any original documentation produced. Typescripts are relatively recent additions, and are often incorrectly referred to as manuscripts. Correspondingly, "mimeo" "xerography" "wet stencil copy" "carbon" "heat print" aren't really seen often. "Perishable office copy" might be a better classification for most of these, just like "perishable office print of electronic file" might be a long term result for those documents produced in offices from digital files. This does leave out a bunch of more obscure classifications of documents, and obviously leaves out a bunch of electronic file types. The only way to deal with a finding aid with partial or complete classification like that is to test the data by sampling cases you think are likely to be wrong, so you get an idea of what the archivist had in mind when producing the finding aid. 

Yes. The shift towards peasant collective farming, generally involving strip rotation of shares, from enslaved farming brought widespread improvements to the standard of living of medieval peasants in England. Collective farming of this nature was the initial mode of farming on illegal waste settlements. Collective farming under monastic control was highly popular, and the destruction of monasteries as economic units was highly resented. Similarly the destruction of the remnant collective spaces of the modern English village brought penury, forced unemployment, effective enslavement (through the poor law) and massive caloric and dietary variety decline to the remnants of the British peasantry. [Hammond & Hammond, The Village Labourer] The throughput went up. The only beneficiaries of this were the beneficiaries of the Enclosures act. 

Readers should be assured that while I deem the US government to have been war criminals for their actions, I am very happy to deem any government so, all governments that meet those simple criteria. 

Let's eliminate number 2 as financially and personally unfeasible for the lay person. If the answer to "how do I determine expertise" is always "become an expert" we'll run out of lay people rapidly! How to trust historians is a more difficult question. I assume strongly that historiography and the historical community of professional and academic historians are adequate to police their own profession. I trust this is true because I'm a historian (trust me!), but also because we win libel cases when we accuse non-historians of being non-historians. ( $URL$ ) But where to find historians talking about other historians in a way lay people can readily understand? Wikipedia has a pretty good policy essay on this. They need lay people to be able to identify which historical sources are good. $URL$ To summarise the essay: follow the scholarly press; look for reviews of works in scholarly presses; look for citations of works in scholarly presses; check to see if the press publishing a work is scholarly. For example: Melville House who published the book in question are a vanity fiction press gone indie. Not where I expect major works of history to come from. The work in question has no reviews or citations in Google Scholar (a quick test, but I'm not wasting time on it), and is old enough to have been reviewed if it was scholarly. Thus, given the bad publisher and the lack of reviews or citations in the scholarly press I'd consider the work "junk." If I were an expert in history of the English language, I might read it compared with my past reading. If I were a lay person interested in the history of the English language, I'd read scholarly works first, and then possibly read this much later after I'd developed a lay context for what the scholars think the history is and make a lay judgement on the value of the text.
