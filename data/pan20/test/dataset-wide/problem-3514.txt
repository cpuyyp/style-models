Is there non-partisan (academically accepted) theory of intrinsic value of labour? Everyday observations say that market prices do not reflect the true value of labour for some professions. E.g. scientists who work in fundamental science contributes greatly to the development of society and industries (e.g. Google Page Rank algorithm works due to Frobenius-Perron theorem), nevertheless they receive very modest pay even in developed countries. Great artists can be neglected during their lifetime but their art can be worth millions some years later. And even more - scientists sometimes make discoveries that can be acknowledged only centuries later. E.g. art scientists and musicologs are among the lowest paid professions (their pay can sometimes be equal to shop assitants' pay) but their theories about aesthetics can be of crucial importance now that development of artificial (general) intelligence and computational creativity requires philosophical and aesthetical answers on the questions "what is art?", "what is valuable art?", "what is semantics of art?". And even more. Theologians are other very poorly paid profession but advent of artificial intelligence requires first-principle theories about norms governing robots and artificially intelligent agents. And computational theology and applied philosophy can provide the basic answers, e.g. what self-driving cars should do in morally conflicting situations. So - how can we estimate the true value of labour and should we acknowledge that market price not always capture the true value of labour? Wiki has some entries about Marx theory of labour value, but I am seeking some non-partisan and widely accepted theory. 

Developmental studies usually is field of reasearch whose object is developing countries and industrial policy studies similarly are attributed to the developing countries or the things of the past. But still I feel that issues researched by these branches of economics are becoming more and more relevant to the economics of developed countries: 

Are there research (and stories more broadly) about professional open source companies? To what types of products their are appropriate, what licensing schemes to choose? How to managed patents and IP? How to motivate and build HR and how to attract volunteer community? How to involve academia in the project? How to organise ownership and how to achieve profitability? What is the past performance of the professional open source companies - what success stories and what failures, what are lessons learned? This question seems to be quite broad, but the subject is nascent and therefore narrow. That is why this question is focused and narrow as well. 

It seems to me that this definition is not completely equivalent to the usual definition of the Nash equilibrium as a strategy profile where each player's strategy is a best response to the strategies of the others. The usual definition says nothing about beliefs and therefore allows for the possibility that beliefs might be incorrect. To take a trivial possibility, consider the Prisoner's Dilemma. Suppose each player believes that the other player will not confess. Since confessing is a dominant strategy each player would still confess. So the actions constitute a Nash equilibrium even though the players' beliefs are completely the opposite of the actual equilibrium actions. Am I right in this understanding that Osborne's definition characterizes something other than Nash's equilibrium? 

With just one producer my guess would have been that the producer would always like a retail price war since a more competitive retail sector would reduce the double-marginalization problem and hence allow the producer to capture more profits. Is this intuition right? And how does moving from monopoly to oligopoly in production change things? This question comes from a real-world observation. This Diwali (which is to Indian retailers what Christmas is to western ones) there was an intense price war among online retailers in India. In response to this price war, many producers of consumer durables like TVs and cameras made public statements against this price war and actively discouraged consumers from buying from these online retailers by measures such as offering longer warranties for products bought from brick-and-mortar stores. A simple explanation for this behavior is that this was just to appease the brick-and-mortar stores which still dominate Indian retail. But could there be a deeper explanation? One story I could think of was as follows: suppose that the price charged by producers to retailers is not directly observed. Then a retailer price war can make it harder to detect a cut in the producer-to-retailer price. This can cause any implicit price collusion between the producers to break down, something which none of the producers would like to happen. But I'm sure this is not the only possible explanation. 

I would submit that the premise is flawed. There is no methodological criteria that unified the Chicago school and separates it from the rest of economics. I think this is true even for Friedman, whose methodological paper you refer to. If you look at his macroeconomic work such as his Monetary History of the United States, Theory of the Consumption Function or his famous presidential address to the AEA,there is nothing in it which is different from the methodology of mainstream economics. I think the same can be said about Stigler's work on industrial organization. The Chicago School was united by its institutional links and its faith in capitalism and not by a distinctive method. And it would be wrong to think of the School as a homogenous entity. See for example this article by Patinkin on the diversity of views on the quantity theory of money: $URL$ 

Contrary to the common view, the physics is all about models, there are no such thing as law of nature, because every physical law has its applicability range and therefore all of laws as models. But any physical law derives from one principle - $URL$ - any particle theroy (there are hundreds of them) is written as the model Lagrangian and then variational principle is applied to arrive at dynamical equations and observable quantities that can be corroborated in experiments. My question is - is there similar approaches, theories, most general models in economics from which every other model or economic law can be applied. If there are such models, then the automation of economics can be achieved (assuming that the automation of mathematics will be completed, e.g. with project $URL$ I have heard definition - the economics is a tuple <...> but I can not remember the book or article or the content of this tuple. Usually such tuples contain t]general mathematical objects: sets of agents with preference functions, set of interaction mechanisms (market system, competition patterns (monopoly etc.)), sets of external shocks (endogeneous factors) and so on... I am seeking more for literature references, trends, keywords, not exhaustive answer. I can further research question by my own, but I should be informed from where to start my efforts. Macroeconomics can (and should) be derived from the microeconomics, therefore I am seeking the model that states first principles - general microeconomic model (from which the general macro models could also be derived in the best case). 

Utility function is great theoretical concept but is it used in customer data analysis or in building customer profile (e.g. from Big data or cash register/checkout data, ecommerce history) or in predicting future sales and future proposals that customers can be eager to accept? If utility function is not used in these areas what other tools (conceptually similar to utility function) is used in customer data analysis? Are there attempts to discover customer goals, intentions and personality, build utility function from these conceptually high level data and use such framework in sales prediction or modelling the desirable features of new product? I have read about behavioral economics but it have strong focus on stock market modelling and little is said about consumer goods and services. 

To derive the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition we assume, among other things, that there is free movement of capital across countries. But this cannot be directly applied to India because of capital controls. While foreigners are relatively free to hold Indian assets, Indians are in general forbidden to hold foreign assets. Is there a variant of the UIP that we can expect to hold (given the other assumptions) under such asymmetric restrictions on asset holding? 

Consider an industry with few producers selling differentiated products. The products must be sold through retailers of whom also there are a few and who therefore possess some degree of market power. Each retailer sells the products of all producers. 

This is just an elaboration of the answer given by @user157623. I am posting it as a community wiki for convenience. Theorem 1 of Section 12 of Kolmogorov and Fomin's Calculus of Variations says 

We can try to apply this theorem to our problem by taking $x$ to be $i$, $c$ to be $y$, $F(i,c,c')=c^\theta$ and $G(i,c,c')=pc$. Then the final differential equation in the theorem becomes $$\theta c_i^{\theta-1} + \lambda p_i=0$$ which is precisely what we need. Is the theorem applicable? Our $K[y]$ is linear, so cannot have an extremal, so the requirement of not having an extremal is easily satisfied. The boundary conditions on $y(a)$ and $y(b)$ do not matter since if a path of $c$, say $c^*(i)$, is extremal without any boundary conditions then it is extremal within the set $c(0)=c^*(0), c(1)=c^*(1)$. The only catch is in the nature of the theorem itself. It gives necessary conditions for an optimum. Given that in our case the necessary condition gives a unique result, all that we need to make it sufficient is to argue that our problem has a solution. The proofs in Kolmogorov-Fomin assume that the functions we are dealing with have continuous first derivatives. So we still need to show that the consumer's problem has an optimal in this class of functions but given that the problem is solved. 

There are a number of online booksellers that are popular in India right now. The prices they charge for the same book often differ by as much as 10% (See this price comparison site to check $URL$ Since these are homogenous goods and anyone who can access one of the stores can as easily assess another I wonder how we might explain this price dispersion. I have not done a systematic study but it is my impression that it is not the case that there is an ordering of prices between stores which is the same for different books. I was wondering whether there are any economic models which can explain this dispersion. In particular are there models which can be tested by using panels of price data. [I confess I am fishing for a research topic.] 

There is trend to arrive at "single customer view" - combine all the available quantitative and qualitative data about single customer. How to organize those data for using in prediction and anylsis? My guess is that all the data should be used for calibration of parameters of some model. But what models are available for representing single customer preferences and behavior? Does agent models from computer science (e.g. BDI - Beliefs-Desires-Intentions) can be used? Maybe neuroecnomics can be of help for building up such models (using choice, cost un intemporal discount functions)? 

There are folklore stories that investments in human capital have saturation level beyond which the marginal return decreases to zero. My questions are - are there measurements how closely the saturation level has been achieved in developed and almost developed countries and have the developed and almost developed countries exhausted all the necessities to make investments in human capital. I.e. my question is - why there are so few investments in human capital in developed and nearly developed countries, do the decision makers believe that the saturation level has been achieved and there is no expected return possible for the further investments? My feeling is that the current decision makers are not fair and that there can be really great return from the additional investment in the human capital but such investments are not being made due to some factors (e.g. due to lobbying efforts by primitive businesses which need primitive and cheap labor). Therefore I am seeking scientifically sound view on this problem. 

So - my question is - how economics and policy planning is responding to these trend. Are there research trends, topics, journals, important monographs with such perspective? I feel that the current developments put the developed nations in the situation that is somehow similar to developing countries - in need to increase competitiveness and in need to correct social issues raised by unequal social development. So - these topics should be researched. I know that I have raised many different topics in my question, but my aim is not to receive separate answer on any of those topics. My aim is to get the name and references to the research trend which answers those questions.
