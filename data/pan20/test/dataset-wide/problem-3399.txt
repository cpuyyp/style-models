Money ultimately is trust and perception. We trust that the United States and the vendors here will exchange the paper or digital money we give them for something we desire. Once this trust is in place and we have a system that functions on a particular monetary system with defined characteristics (total money in circulation, methods of exchange, denominations of physical money, means of accounting, etc.) we then assign values to physical things on the basis of that system and our perceptions of those things. Money has no intrinsic value. You cannot eat it, build a worthwhile shelter out of it, etc. It doesn't meet your physical needs. Thus, without trust people seek desperately to trade their currency for physical goods. This makes the demand for money plummet, while the demand for physical goods simultaneously skyrockets. The purchasing power of that money falls and you get hyperinflation. Examples of this can be seen in the Weimar Republic after World War 1 and Kenya, that both experienced this situation when trust in those currencies fell and the central banks overprinted money. Another interesting example can be found in fame. Take a sports shoe for example. That shoe may be worth some amount purchased from the retailer. However, say that shoe is signed by an incredibly famous athlete. With a very small value of ink and seconds of that athlete's time, the shoe's value will skyrocket without any addition of utility. The only thing that has changed is perception. The last example I will point to is the US debt. Currently, the United States claims approximately $20 trillion of debt. The physical currency does not exist. That money could never exist. 20 trillion is an incomprehensibly large number. Never in my life have I ever encountered something, and decided, "Hmm, that seems like around 20 trillion." It is not a physically realizable quantity. In other words, its perception, imagination if you will. Ultimately, money is a system of perceived value that only functions properly while all parties involved with the currency trust that it will continue to be a means of exchange for physical goods that meet their needs and wants. Any currency that is not trusted will fail. 

In Financial Market, Public Policy, and the East Asian Miracle by Stiglitz and Uy (World Bank Research Observer, vol. 11, no.2, 1996), the authors state that: 

We are then shown the supposedly interesting result that, given these obviously incompatible preferences, no possible voting system can pick a favoured option in a non-arbitrary way. More generally, any voting system risks ending up in this kind of three-way tie situation. But this seems impossibly theoretical a concern. Clearly if voters' preferences split n alternatives precisely n ways, as in this example, there's no outcome that satisfies a majority. But in an electorate, the probability of this is vanishingly small. Also, if each alternative is joint first in preference, we surely don't care which one is selected. Why do we teach this mysterious theorem at all? Is it just because it's got a cool name? Has it ever been usefully applied to a real-world problem? 

A central bank sets the interest rates for banks (i.e. not us mere mortals) to borrow from it. Low interest rates are a central bank's tool to try and encourage banks to lend, thereby encouraging all sorts of helpful behaviours like investment and home-buying. (If rates are low, that should mean borrowing for mortals is cheap, because you'd hope the banks pass on those low central bank rates to their customers!) But if there's something fundamentally "wrong" with the economy, banks won't lend and/or people won't want to invest/borrow however low the interest rates get. After all, the idea of being in debt might be worrying to people per se, not just because of the interest repayments. So the central banks have been lowering and lowering rates, desperate to kickstart the economy, but it's not been working, because there's something just "wrong" with the economy, and it's got nothing to do with interest rates. That could be to do with banks being scared to lend (not enough money in their safety cushions perhaps?) or people/firms being too scared to borrow/invest (worries that things will get worse in the near future maybe?) So rates get ever lower, and still the economy doesn't get moving. 

First, according to MWG, Def 15.B.1, "a Walrasian (or competitive) equilibrium for an Edgeworth box exonomy is a price vector $p^\star$ and an allocation $x^\star = (x_1^\star, x_2^\star)$ in the Edgeworth box such that for $i=1,2$:" $$ x_i^\star \succeq_i x_i^\prime \qquad \text{for all} \quad x_i^\prime \in B_i(p^\star) $$ Typically in such problems, you must have the Walrasian demands for each consumer and good, and the initial endowments for each consumer. From every endowment, $\omega_i$, you can infer the individual's wealth, just and obviously multiplying the endowment's quantities for each good with the respective prices. For example, having $\omega_1=(2,3)$, means that the individual 1 is endowed with 2 "units" of good 1 and 3 of good 2. So his/her wealth would be $w_1 = 2 \cdot p_1 + 3 \cdot p_2$. With these, you can proceed to find the Walrasian equilibrium; however, a more detailed question on your behalf would be more enlightening. 

Goyal (2012) accurately explains the F-M procedure (section 2.5). He states that "whether there is a bias in the traditional Fama–MacBeth approach if expected returns vary with time-varying characteristics is still unexplored.". Moreover, he says that "autocorrelation in returns (negligible at monthly frequency) leads to autocorrelation in risk premium estimates. This is easily accounted for by Newey– West type corrections to variance formulas". Mitchell (2009) discusses the SEs in financial panel data and clearly states that we should identify the presence of a firm or time effect to see whether the Fama-MacBeth standard errors are unbiased. Ibragimov and Mueller (2010) "find that as long as year coefficient estimators are approximately normal (or scale mixtures of normals) and independent, the Fama–MacBeth method results in valid inference even for a short panel that is heterogenous over time." 

People use the Hausman test to decide between fixed/random effects models, but I find the intuition and justification of the choice of the proper model more appropriate. I am unaware for a specific test which includes Fama-MacBeth but I am far from an expert in the field.
