I have more years of work experience than my boss has been alive. But he is one of the best bosses I've ever worked for. First, he has made it clear he values my experience and he asks for my input into a variety of technical issues. But it is also clear that while he listens to what I have to say, he is the final arbiter of what we will do. Second, he rewards good work and lets people know when they need to improve - his subordinates are never kept guessing as to how he feels about their work. He is fair. Nobody is perfect and he will need to discuss issues with any one of us. He discusses issues in private and gives out praise in public. Issues when they are brought up are never personal attacks or blame sessions. The discussions are more along the lines of this is what went wrong and what can we do to prevent it from happening again. He seeks input and more importantly, he makes sure to take that input to higher levels and makes sure we get the credit for our suggestions if higher management buys off on them. He pushes for promotions and pay raises for his people. We have an awards program and he takes the time to make sure at least one of his employess is nominated each time the awards cycle comes around. He makes it easy to tell him you need emergency leave and to make sure your work is covered. It is easy to accept someone with less experience as your boss when he treats you and all his other subordinates well. Now it's trickier if the person wanted that promotion himself. It's best to sit down and talk about the situation openly. Tell him how much you value his experience; tell him that you want to make sure the next promotion has his name on it. If you know why he was passed over (sometimes it's obvious to everyone except the person passed over), then discuss that too. Let him know what he needs to do to improve his chances of being selected. Likely he is not as politically savvy as he should be, help him to see what actions he needs to take to get credit for his work and if you promise to help promote his cause to management, make sure he hears you giving him credit for his good work. One compliment to a higher boss that he hears will do a lot ot relieve any anxiousness about you. That said, you are the boss now and he has to respect that too whether he is happy about your promotion or not. So don't let him get away with behaving badly. The sooner you confront behavior like trying to override what you are saying in public, the sooner it will get fixed. If you don't confront early, it may very well escalate until you have an actual performance issue to deal with officially. If he thinks he call bully you, he will. Tell him privately that you don't want him to interrupt you when you are talking to others. Tell him you will ask for his input when training others or presenting things to management and make sure he gets the credit. 

My opinion, you're overthinking this. Breaks in monotony are work time just as much as typing in the editor. It's part of the creative process. So, chatting with teammates, getting a snack, checking SO while waiting for a build to complete just come with the territory. The situation is the same for ancillary distractions such as random phone calls and such. No one stops the clock for two minutes to answer a call from their mother. Over time, you'll develop a professional sense of what a work-break (billable) vs. a break in work (not billable). Yes, this is different then task based work, such as answering phones or data entry. Also keep in mind that tracking such trivial 'breaks' can take as much time as the breaks themselves. Finally, this is an impossible thing to judge. Some very productive people don't appear to do much work while some other work hard for relative average output. Lunch is a grey area. If you billing as an FTE, then the daily rate may include that but generally, you don't bill the hour you take for lunch just as you would bill any time taken for doing random errands during the day. 

Because it makes the readers go to sleep after the 567th repetition of I. And because it saves space which is helpful when you have 30 years experience and only 2 pages to put it on. And since it is a CV, the reader will assume it was you and no-one else who did the task. 

Probably one of the most important things you can gain from an internship is learning that in the business world there is no such thing as purely technical problem. Becasue of that, what seem, to the idealist, to be the best solutions are not the ones the business chooses or needs. Nor should they be. Things besides pure technology that have to be considered might include: 

You say that the corporate culture was not a good fit and then you describe the work conditions that you think would be a good fit for you. You may need to be prepared to say why you didn't think it was good fit although talking preemptively about what kind of corporate culture you want will likely forestall this. Don't say anything horribly negative about that particular boss or company at all if you can help it. You could say for instance that you felt that the workplace had a lot of cliques and that you didn't fit into any and it made you feel uncomfortable. But don't say it as: they were a gossipy bunch who told lies about me behind my back. Think through what to say pretty thoroughly as far as culture, I might not want to hear that you don't like working with younger people if my staff are mostly younger. On the other hand if that is true, Then you don't; want to move to another job where you won't be happy. But I might like to hear that you prefer to work in a cooperative environment rather than a competitive one (unless my workplace is super competitive, in which case you might not be happy there anyway if you prefer cooperation). I have found through the years, it is better to get filtered out for cultural reasons before starting a job than to go to work in a place where there is no chance you will fit in and feel comfortable. Sometimes that means it takes a longer to find the right fit, but that is better than leaving one job you hate for another one you hate more. 

If you want to leave the most positive impression, the third option is the best option. It would imply that your company understands the position of the intern (maybe because we were once interns back in the day); and we see potential in you (so you mean something to us). So maybe let's try this again another day (because we want you to be at your best for us). An alternative would be to empathize with the candidate, say your honest feelings (you thought they had technical potential) but the company policy does not allow for redo interviews so unfortunately you'd need to part ways. Happily invite them to apply again next time/year as well. Note that you need to be more empathetic here than if you were going to redo (e.g. explain a situation where a candidate did worse than them, say something funny from your first interview or whatever). This happened to me when I was an interviewer for another permanent candidate. We ended up having a redo but declined the person unfortunately. 

It depends on exactly what you're selling. Most contractors sell their time so any time you work for the client is paid for. Non delivery related time is generally not billed, such as sales or negotiations. If you contract includes expenses, all reasonable expenses are billed as well. 

You can address the "unprofessional" comment by essentially conspiring with your manager to have them close the door. Meaning, you manager can swing by a couple of times for whatever reason, then on the way out ask "open or closed?". The three of you say "closed". Manager, hearing the clear majority says "no problem, thanks for the...whatever..." then closes the door. 

Yes, chat tends to be must less formal then even email. I used to try to be correct, but, really, it's just not worth time. 

Why do you think you're not held accountable? Don't interpret the professor's lack of engagement for a lack of expectation. In fact, hands off managers often have much, much higher expectations than micro-managers. 

I am trying to practice continuous learning at home so that I can keep up with newer technologies as a software engineer. For me continuous learning involves tinkering with code, reading stackoverflow/reddit/dzone sites that is different to what I do at work. The only problem is that I have a daughter that constantly wants my attention so I often put the continuous learning time on hold to make the time with her. On the one hand I feel it's wrong to ignore your family completely in pursuit of continuous learning. On the other hand, and probably more so for software engineering, you need to keep up with technology so that you don't get left behind, so I feel that not practicing continuous learning is a bad thing. There's also the option of proportioning time at work solely for learning, but I do not know the ethics of that (do people expect presentations of what I am learning about and stuff like that). Also how much time is okay from a work perspective? So the question is, how do I manage/approach this properly so that I can get some sort of balance? I do realize that I can't do the kind of continuous learning that I really want; so I have to make compromises but I do not know which parts are important enough for me. 

Unfortunately, what you describe is not at all uncommon. If a "Knowledge Transfer" covers 30% of the job, that's pretty awesome. The most important thing to do is identify other people in the area/department who are also versed in whatever you're doing. 

Bluntly, yes. But, neither of you are at fault. In the case you describe, you work style and the professor's management style simply do not blend well and this is not at all uncommon. The long term problem is that it's highly unlikely either of you will change. 

This question can only be answered by the appropriate departments within your company, Legal, HR, etc. In the interim, you only practical option may be to assign tasks that are not on any critical path and have very flexible delivery dates. The 'nice to have' features that can be shipped whenever they're done. 

For organizations that use the 'Expert Model' documenting the state is more important than the process because process is secondary to the result. Unfortunately, this is a cultural shift very few organizations can accomplish. 

I am going to address how do you continue to work with them. This is a hard one that I have faced mulitple times being a woman in a mostly male field espcially in the 1980s when harrassment was overt and rampant. The first thing you need to do is make sure that their poor opinion of you does not become the default opinion of everyone else. To this end, even though it seems unfair, you need to do two things. First you need to take the high road and always treat them respectfully and courteously. Especially take care to give them credit when credit is due (yes I know you hate them, but tough) and to listen to their professional opinions in meetings and, most importantly, to not lose your temper over what you know they are thinking vice what they actually said. This makes them look especially stupid for things they say about you behind your back and impresses others in the group. Next, you need to become known as a top performer. You need to do your job better than anyone else in the office to overcome the negative impression these people are probably spreading about you. And if you don't do it now, learn to make sure others know about your successes. Office politics are important for everyone but they are way more important when you have nasty people potentially spreading lies about you. It would serve you well to read some books onthe subject of Office politics. You can also collect information using legitimate means and document their attitudes if they show them openly and then report it to HR. But honestly, I have found that it is far more effective to make them look small by your good performance and it is better for you personally too. And when you get rewarded for that great performance, it will really upset them. Sometimes you have to say to yourself, "Living well is the best revenge." They will hate your success, so use this as the impetus to go out and be a spectactular success. 

You can omit anything you want from your resume but be prepared to explain any gaps and make sure the application requirements don't specifically require all employment be listed. From there... Put it this way, if you include the nuclear work and they... -Reject you. Accept you're not a good fit. -Accept you. They are accepting your previous work and you don't have to hide anything. If you omit the nuclear work and they... -Reject you. You'll wonder if they would have been willing to over look the specific nuclear aspect. -Accept you. You'll potentially have a secret this is either exploitable or may cause distrust if ever learned. 

For organizations that subscribe to the 'Process Model', yes, and 99% of the time, the documentation has 0 ROI due to the exact circumstances you describe. This is just bureaucracy. Keep in mind though that there may be some regulatory benefit to such schemes and that should be well known to everyone. 

I think it all depends on the expectations that you set with your interviewer. I do not think you would be looked at "quizzically" if you arranged it with them beforehand. The reason is that they would expect it and they know it will happen. They might even want to help you out with the cabling and providing a bigger screen. Suppose that they did not expect it, so you just whip out your laptop at the time of the interview; then there exists the possibility of a "quizzical" reaction. The interviewer will probably also just say "no" and force to solve the problem on a whiteboard. At the same time, I think that the point of a whiteboard question is not to test syntax and speed, but rather to evaluate problem solving skills. There's a different criteria that your interviewer will look for that simply checking "how fast you write/program". Also consider that you might make it harder on yourself by taking a laptop with for code writing. Your interviewer might be less lenient on you because you're in your ideal setup, so making mistakes might count more. They might even add more criteria than a whiteboard evaluation because of this.
