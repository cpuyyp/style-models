The concept you have in mind is plenty believable for fiction but there are a few changes I think would be necessary. These aren't going to be trees. Tree is a specific name for a specific type of plant. Trees require soil and can't handle salt water (in most situations). They are also generally hard and inflexible which would be detrimental if they exist in a medium that is constantly in motion, meaning the ocean. So in short the type of plant you describe could likely exist but it would definitely not be a tree. It would likely be some sort of super seaweed. You would also probably need to consider allowing your super seaweed to take root in shallow waters allowing for more nutrients and larger growth. The size you are looking for will be tough to get to if they are completely free floating all the time. It may not be relevant to your story but in your head you should also probably consider that they had to have evolved the ability to trap and consume fish if you want to go that route meaning that being able to take root or something similar would have been needed earlier in the evolutionary history of the organism. Also...humans wouldn't evolve as humans on this world so keep that in mind...either they are transplants or humanoid but not quite human. 

No, not even close Pistols as well as most guns are made of stainless steel. Many other compunds are needed to make a working gun, such as copper, zinc, gunpowder and other assorted alloys. The main problem here is the steel. In which it will last 10 years of a reasonable rust free life assuming its zinc plated. Whereas austenitic stainless steel fasteners will give at least 30 years trouble free life for most applications. So short story even shorter, no the gun won't even last 10% of your goal. 

The most obvious example would be World War II, it fits your volume of troops better than any other situation from history. At the end of World War II there were in the neighborhood of 12 MILLION active duty US military personnel. The post war demobilization effort was named Operation Magic Carpet (which isn't really relevant I just really like the name) took a few years and reduced the active military force to just over 1.5 million. Most went back to lives in the civilian sector. The expectation of 'care' provided for veterans by the government was significantly less expansive at the time. 

Let me introduce you to the golden silk orb-weaver, this spiders silk is known for its tensile strength. It is indeed so strong that if it was as thick as a pencil, it could stop a jet! In 2012 a cape was even mad using this material and if its molecular compound can be determined, it will easily replace kevlar. 

People vote, likely for candidates they agree with. You need money to run a campaign. There is a maximum campaign coverage. There winds up being only two real choices by the end 

I think the best solution for the initial stages of your project is some form of electronic monitoring. RF ID tags could be a solid way to go, though the delivery system and range would be tricky. Hitachi Unveils Smallest RFID Chip The Japanese chip maker recently showed off an RFID microchip that is just 0.3 square millimeter square. RF ID tags can be pretty dang small. So for this system to work you would need 

No Evolution works because every stage in the creatures evolutionary history is better than the last, this means that a creature would have to slowly evolve to mimic humans. The problem with this lies in the fact that human, as the only sapient animals on earth, would not be fooled at the early stages of mimicry. They might be fooled at the final stage but not the stages in between (and to those who say "they weren't sapient when merfolk evolved", then they wouldn't be sea faring and proto-merpeople wouldn't know of them) and thus early hair would be useless and not chosen as an evolutionary trait. Ignoring this failure of design, lets say they somehow evolved the hair a different way, the only way they could get enough calories to live would be to kill 1 human a day, this means living near the shipyard or dock to lure humans to their death. But 1 human 'missing' a day would either 1) cause humans to kill the merperson or 2) cause humans to leave(assuming they can't kill the merperson). Either way the merperson can't live off of human alone. 

Upon walking into the cave you would see this (below): A 25 foot tall stone wall nestled into a narrow point in a large cavern. 

Get costumes. Animal carcasses of vicious beasts making the men appear half man half animal could work. Black or white body paint could make them appear as ghosts/spirits. Always win. Winning means not being found out. Your band must remain mysterious and feared. This is not to say you always massacre everyone but you should do some savage and significant damage before fading into the trees/mountains. A few crazed survivors help spread the legend and fear. Strange weapons and technology. This supports the fear and mystery concept as well. If you are in a land of long swords use scimitars, or something else that is otherwise foreign, it adds to the exotic nature and mystery of the group. Big weapons (2H axes, swords, hammers etc) are and option as well, they can be downright intimidating before they are even swung. If you have some sort of tech, Greek fire as a historic example, that can help set the group apart. Let time pass between events. Don't attack every caravan that rolls through your territory. If you can manage it you could let a couple years roll by so people start thinking its just a story or that the menace is gone. Then slaughter something...its good to have a calling card. Maybe stacking corpses a certain way or something otherwise brutal. 

Every place on the chart has a section of the mouth that is required to use it. Now all you need to do is remove sounds made in places your species doesn't have. For example, a species of bird people would be unable to make labial sounds (Like english /m/, /p/, /b/, /f/ or /v/) But would likely have a strong glottis, making for Radicals and Laryngeal sounds to be made easier. Of course, for sounds people can't make, you're out of luck, but trust me, your readers aren't going to evolve a new mouth just to speak your conlang. Stick to the sounds people can make, as well as animals. 

I would just add that, I would not want to keep an infectious shell of a former family around for sentimental reasons. Now, I can see a trade springing up if the zombies were not infectious, or perhaps they are only infectious for 6 months at which point they are harmless simpletons, but even then I wouldn't do that to a family member...well maybe one or two but not most of them. 

Robots are people to! Have you seen Chappie? In it, a police robot named Chappie becomes sapient and, despite ignoring Asimovs laws, he is quite peaceful, same thing with Johnny 5. Now keep in mind that in both of these situations, humans refuse to acknowledge AI robots as sapient and often take cruel measures against them. Now if (using a complex series of events) robots are accepted into our society as 'people' (Ei Overwatch) then, if they even follow the laws, they are most likely to follow the fifth order. 

Why are humans screwed? Well, we kill insects all the time. We drive cars, we walk, we reflexively swat things that land on us... Insects are going to die...according to your treaty it's a one for one deal so then humans die...and there are waaaay more of them then us...and if we try to live up to the deal in the treaty there will be even more as we won't be spraying pesticides and swatting spiders and flies in our homes...odds are this could even lead to larger disease outbreaks which kill even more humans. Eventually, even if the insects don't declare war to exterminate us, we will be gone simply by living. The human population will dwindle over time to the point where we no longer have a minimum necessary population to survive as a species. I say we arm up with flamethrowers and deet laced armor and go out in a blaze of fiery glory instead.
