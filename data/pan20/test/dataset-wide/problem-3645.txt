Heart rates can trend lower in a pool, because your body is horizontal and your heart is not fighting gravity to get blood back up from the extremities. It's along the same principle as your heart rate is lower when lying down than when standing. As far as the cardiovascular, a high heart rate does not automatically increase your cardio fitness. It's function of the work you are doing, not how fast your heart rate gets. If anything, it's possibly that swimming (in general) is better for cardio, as one of the biggest limiters in cardiovascular exercise is being able to get rid of heat. (Aside from the benefits of non impact exercise). 

These were derived using testing and direct measurements to come up with broad based formulae. While probably not 100% accurate for everyone, they come pretty close. Most of your calorie burn calculators in various treadmills, etc., rely on one of these equations as their base. The formulae themselves are backed by a lot of research and refinement, however because no two people are alike, they may over or under represent calories burned on an individual basis. Personally, I like the Katch-McArdle, with the Mifflin equation being nearly equal. These represent BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) which accounts for 60-70% of the calories burned in a day. The other values for exercise have been usually pulled from a table, of which there are a few available. These are also somewhat generic, but they have been collated by using indirect calorimetry of individuals during various exercise bouts. So while they are general (like the BMR equations) they have been derived from direct sampling. 

I'm assuming the chafing is where your thighs are rubbing. Longer shorts, long underwear and bodyglide will help cut the chafing. 

Weight gainers don't necessarily "augment muscular mass", they are just calorie bombs. It's what you do with the calories that matters. A product like this does what it advertises, you gain weight. If you are not doing the workouts to support that amount of caloric intake, you'll gain it in fat. There is no "easily getting" to where you want, it all takes hard work. Where it has an advantage is if you are doing massive amounts of workouts, and are limited on what/when you can eat. For example, Michael Phelps at peak training consumes in the range of 8-10,000 calories a day. For most dieticians, they shudder to see his daily plate, but he needs those calories to fuel his workouts and recovery. Probably 95% of the general public just doesn't need that many calories. Also, remember that the vast majority of Phelp's workout regimen is very low impact cardio, I don't know if you could sustain 8,000 calories worth of straight weight workouts for very long without running into overuse/recovery issues. 

I think your answer would be no, as I understand how L-Carnitine works in the body. ALCAR is an acetylated version of l-carnitine, and it occurs naturally, as well as the body creating it's own as needed. Ingesting it already acetylated can enhance the availability of it in the body. It's a little confusing in how it shuffles in and out of the cells, and it gets converted to l-carnitine then moved back into the cell with acyl groups. In theory, it helps promote higher utilization of fatty acids at the expense of glucose, but high amounts of CoA (Coenzyme A) can block it, and ALCAR does promote higher glucose utilization (Which, theoretically, would prevent said glucose from being converted for storage). Bottom line, it's possible it might help, but in my personal opinion, the possibility is slim enough I'd rather eat a healthy diet and let my body convert l-carnitine to ALCAR naturally (Which it does do). 

It is difficult to say without seeing your swim stroke, but I suspect that when you are breathing, you are over rotating, with your head pulled back rather than being in a neutral position. That would allow water to enter in your nose. When swimming freestyle, you don't really move your head much. The top of the head should be in the water, which will create a little bit of a "bow wave" effect, and you breathe in the trough that is created. There is almost always a little bit of water that can enter into the mouth, but you generally exhale it out with the breath. And while you may be in good running shape, swimming involves many more muscles (especially upper body) that aren't used to the effort. Also, it's very technique driven, so if your technique is poor, you will fatigue faster as you "fight" the water. I would recommend an adult beginner swim program, it will help immensely. If that is not feasible, look at programs online such as swimsmooth and Total Immersion. 

No, it won't. The 10kg that you lost was living tissue, whether fat or not. It had a metabolic cost to carry around and sustain, whether during cardio or sitting at home. You can carry 10 kg in a vest or something, but it's not going to be the same as having 10kg of body weight. If you are exchanging fat for building muscle, you are ahead of the game anyway, as muscle consumes more calories than fat on a daily basis anyway. 

Part of your confusion stems from the fact that people use threshold training to mean different things. Most of the time, joe runner on the street uses threshold and interval training as terms in comparison to race times, not to the actual physiological AnT (Anaerobic Threshold, or lactate threshold). In those terms, threshold training is training done near race pace, with short rest. Interval training is done above race pace, with long rest. For an example: You go out and run an all out 5k, and get a time of 18:38, which is a 6 minute per mile pace. This establishes your baseline max. A threshold workout would be something like 8 x 400 on 2:00, hold 1:45. (Meaning run 8 400's, try to keep every one under 1:45, leave on the 2:00 mark for each one). An interval workout would be 8 x 400 on 1:15, 1:00-1:30 rest between. Threshold workouts are done to increase the amount of time you can spend at or near race pace. Interval workouts are designed to make your race pace faster. The rest of the time should be mostly LSD, done well below your AnT, maybe with some occasional pickups/strides for tempo. The biggest mistake the vast majority of endurance athletes make is they don't go easy enough on the easy days, and they don't go hard enough on the hard days. Now, since you had a doctor do your HR zones, you may actually have a decent idea of your HR max. (Ignore 220-age, it's meaningless drivel. I'm 51 now and I can still hit 190. It was originally based on bad science, and repeated because it was easy). Your AnT is going to probably be in the neighborhood of 80-85% of your HR max, but that's not 100% given. For your training plan, I'm not really a fan of it. You have two days where you run great big whacks of distance, a couple interval days, and 3 days rest. For half to full marathons, I would keep the long Sunday run, but then chunk up the Monday run and add a couple days, so make Mon, Wed and Fri each 10kish in distance (at an 8 minute pace, a 10k takes you about 50 mins), and make sure they are easy tempo, well within the aerobic range. Vary your interval and threshold distances from 400-1600m (10 minute warmup, 5x1600 at 6:30 with 1 min rest, 15 min warmdown is a great workout), and pay attention to nutrition and rest. 

Lessons - Get some swim lessons, or at least some time with a decent stroke instructor who can tell you what you can improve on. Ask for specific drills. Workouts - Your workout isn't really structured to make you a better or a faster swimmer. I would look at "Swim workouts in a Binder" in any of the variations (They have one specifically for triathletes) to get an idea of what a swim workout would look like.
