Since this episode when you wake from sleep are you groggy and tired or relaxed and alert? The lack of activity isn't an indicator of anything, the quality of the mind and body is. Do you see a decrease in sense desires and aversions? Do you see a decrease in any addictions or obsessive habits, such as checking your phone for notifications? This can be a very good sign if any of the above positives are true. Otherwise something is seriously wrong with your meditation technique, but not to worry such errors are early corrected. 

Perhaps there is a right time and way to tell him that you don't enjoy his gossip or a way to remain silent without giving offense, but it is also wise to consider that you may fail at this. There's a Zen saying that the tiger needs to live in the forest to be safe, a tiger out and about in the town is quickly dead. Merely awakening to one's true self may even seem easier in comparison to mixing nirvana with samsara. 

How valid or verifiable is the claim that a sotapanna leads no more than seven lives? Or a once returner returns once? There is another claim that practicing earnestly for seven days or seven weeks or a maximum of seven years should be enough to attain nibbana. Whereas as far as I can see, nibbana doesn't seem too common at all. Certainly not the kind of numbers one would expect if it was possible in a few years. Is there present day evidence for the latter? If there isn't then shouldn't it also lead me to wonder about the former? (Note: I'm not saying arahatship or lesser ariya states are impossible, just not very sure about the maintainability and significance of the number 7) What is the learned opinion here? The Zen approach of nowhere to go, nowhere to arrive seems more commonsensical to the extent that there is nothing to disprove. On the flip side one can be really only wearing out one's cushion in the Zendo, and there'd be no way to verify one's attainment. 

Maithri or metta bhavana towards oneself is acceptable at most times. However, unless one is rested, is not stressed and not carrying unwholesome thoughts, performing it for others is not recommended. Simply because it's rare for one to wish harm to the self, but easier to wish it for others, even unintentionally, because we often pass judgement of slight proportions without being aware of it. One can also combine the Anapanasāti with metta by repeating this gātha as we breathe - "Breathing in, I feel calm and relaxed in body and mind; Breathing out, I see a beautiful smile appear on my lips" Update: Some comments have revealed a sentiment that it is okay to do metta in any quality of mind. It's very important to not practice metta bhavana with a mind of defilements, or we can transmit negativity, and harm our objects of metta instead of helping. 

We must learn to thank the physically uncomfortable things in life, because it is a great teacher. The retreat center in my city is right beneath the primary flight path to a busy airport. New meditators on their first retreat often get very irritated by this - because not only is it hot and sweaty, especially if they aren't from India, but they didn't sign up to deal with this infernal din from above. We may not realize it, but we often live in our thoughts and memories and not in the present moment. Our memory of comfort is what comes in conflict with the present discomfort, not the physical pain itself, since it is the mind that gives meaning to pain. When irritation swells up in us we must immediately thank it, and investigate it - who is getting irritated? Where is the clinging coming from? What exactly is uncomfortable? What is getting hurt? Is it our senses or our expectation? When exactly did the irritation begin? What happens to our attention at the moment of irritation? When does it end? How soon does it begin, and how soon does it end? What is its nature? Is it constant or does it arise and pass in waves? Can one see the three characteristics of anicca, anatta and dukkha in the irritation? and so on. When the first aircraft flew above me, I was mildly irritated by it, but seeing that this was a great teacher who had come to guide me, I began to practice loving kindness towards the passengers in every aircraft that flew above me after that. Soon it became a habit, and so while there were some who would audibly sigh and hiss at the aircraft, I would be enveloped in a warm glow of love several times every hour. It isn't the physical reality but our reaction to it that matters. 

There have always been scandals and corruption in monastic orders since the time of the Buddha, as well as rather rigid and dogmatic views taken by some abbots. So, that cannot be a new reason to decry the tradition. The Buddha certainly appears to have spent a lot of time dealing with problem makers of this sort. And both problems continue to be pretty common in almost all Buddhist traditions today (Tibetan, Theravada, Zen etc) who in addition seem to have also confused culture with the pursuit of the truth. Now, a monk who isn't a local, enrolling in any foreign tradition spends a lot of time learning the new culture, the language, the food, the social mores, often dealing with racism to boot - all of which appear to be a waste of time, taking away from actual time spent on spiritual development. The saving grace is that it teaches perseverance, patience and doggedness, but is it enough? What's the alternative? Maybe it is this?

Each of the sects alive today originated to suit their time and place - they were a result of the personalities of the teachers, and the receptiveness of the population. There were other sects that have since perished and faded {source}, but enlightened a great many when they were popular. The truth of nirvana can be attained through a great many ways, and the Buddha himself never offered a single formula for all to follow. Some find samadhi or meditation more appealing, some find sila or ethical behavior more appealing, and some best respond to philosophical inquiry or prajna. It depends on our respective past lives, past merits and available opportunities. For some, especially those on the path of wisdom or prajna, examining several schools maybe necessary. They are cautious by nature, and are fond of extensive verification. Their quest of inquiry may take them to several teachers, and even several religions. As long as their intent is to realize the truth, there is nothing wrong with this. In fact, the Buddha too was like this, and over his several lives, studied with a great many teachers. It works best if we find a teacher or school that resonates, that changes us deeply. We use what works, discard what doesn't. Some people have bad allergies from good medicine, it is not the fault of the medicine or the individual. We must ultimately be very practical about our choices. If we are not too hungry, we can wait until we find a restaurant we like, but if we are really hungry, we eat wherever we get food.
