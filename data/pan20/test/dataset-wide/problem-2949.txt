Thanks to both answers and the prods and clarifications offered I wwas able to dredge up some resources on where this quote, if the paraphrase above can be called that, came from. It was hiding in plain sight, it was David Hume who said it. A good run down of the work can be found in this breakdown of his work An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: "we need to root the enemy out of their hiding places" (as the author's summary put it). This helped me to find the actual passage, where the "secret word" as it were, was "retreat" (as opposed to hiding places, and I am unsure where woods came from): 

In my undergraduate days, I remember reading someone occupying roughly a mental and historical space as David Hume (originally my thought was between Hume and Kuhn), and have a vaguely recalled passage that I would like to source. Though on first asking this question I thought it may even be Hume or Kuhn, I am fairly convinced after more searching that the topic and metaphor came from the Hume end of the spectrum (if not he himself); 

Insofar as any of these relationships are defined and scoped by the human mind, so are they contingent upon the human mind. Dependency/independency of some mind begs all the wrong questions and results in meaningful and senseless statements like "equality exists outside of space and time" and "laws of physics, equally, are part of the universe, regardless of human observation." These, in turn, result in all kinds of sloppy language. 

This question is not meant to deal with the religious side of the Teapot (or FSM or the Invisible Pink Unicorn), but rather the inherent epistemological claims and their export to other areas of knowledge. With respect solely to the epistemic; 

Based on your summary, it appears both methods of reading interpret the writings of the Tractatus as senseless (irresolute) or nonsense (resolute). In other words, both readings, if applied to the whole of the text, would classify it as belonging to something beyond the limits of "world, thought and language". It seems safe to assume that Wittgenstein's purpose in writing the Tractatus was not to expound a litany of senseless or nonsensical propositions supported solely on the basis of a private language. Interpretation based on (in)austere readings of sense may be convenient; however, any interpretation should follow intent lest it be some prattling on about how a square peg doesn't fit into a circlular hole. An alternate interpretation (to apply to the possibility of meaning or sensibility of the propositions) is how they are meaningful/less, their correspondence to states of affairs (SOA). In this strictest sense, logic and (particularly) the methods of logic written about in the Tractatus are senseless. This was by virtue of Wittgenstein's differentiation of the operation of the rules of logic and their lack of correspondence with any possible SOA. What remains of the Tractatus after the statements of logic are stripped away? Ignoring the side debate of whether a claim instantiated by nonsense or senseless proposition is thereby corrupted, it is wholly possible to read through the Tractatus as a work of the unsayable. Further, in Letters from Ludwig Wittgenstein it is expressed that he intended the work to be read with an eye to the ethical (think more Vienna Circle, less Analytics). Here is a summation of what this can mean (TLP citations): 

I agree with what Chad says in that there are other options and that, to answer your question, civil disobedience (refusing to answer) suffices a solution to this particular problem. Consequentialism (your house getting burned down) is not a sustainable justification for disavowing a categorical imperative. This is because categorical imperatives deal in absolutes; as a result, an consequential analysis must have an absolute result, otherwise it fails. At base however is whether any two categorical imperatives can conflict. (Assuming categorical imperatives can exist,) if two categorical imperatives (assuming that even one could exist) were to "conflict" would that mean that one was wrong, or perhaps that there was some temporal incompatibility that has yet to be resolved which upon resolution will show the two to be compatible? The point being, assuming that two imperatives conflict, and we are dealing in some absolutist terms, and any solutions are mutually exclusive in meeting the needs of both; it is likelier that one categorical imperative is wrong or misunderstood than that no solution is useful. 

The above passage exhorts the will to "cultivate true metaphysics with some care, in order to destroy the false and adulterate." 

*at this point, we're transcending things entirely and starting to talk about general facts. If we only cared about the objects in the universe, this would not be 'part of the universe' Wittgenstein also is talks a lot about hypothetical facts 

Almost all scientific theories are taken 'for granted' we don't have to re-test them every time we come to a conclusion that relies upon them being true. I.e. if I want to test whether Ball A is bouncier than Ball B, I assume that the laws of motion apply equally to both balls, and that acceleration due to gravity is the same for both, etc.. 

You can't really identify a logical fallacy unless someone makes a claim, and the only claim your question describes is this: 

Dawkins presents this hypothetical argument without providing concrete examples of people actually using it. It is probably no coincidence, that even if has heard the argument used, he paraphrased it here in such a way that it is perfectly destroyed by his pre-prepared counter-argument, this is a classic straw-man. 

The problem you're having with that statement is that it's ambiguous. I suggest the follow two possible interpretations of your statement, one of which is impossible, one is completely valid. I believe to understand it, you need to specify which meaning you mean. 

Although we take these things to granted, we do allow for them to be disproved or to proved to be lacking; if new evidence arises that does so; but we may not seek that evidence out. Many of these theories are proven 'beyond reasonable doubt' but may never be proved to be 'absolutely true' 

You're missing information on whether or not A AND C is representative of A and representative of B. I.e. it could be that A AND C represents 49% of A, and 49% of C, and that NONE of them are B. Let's try an example: 

We could classify AI in an infinite number of other ways; some based on outcome, others based on how it works on a technical level. Here are some examples: Strong and Weak AI Your first 'School' of AI is probably Artificial general intelligence "(AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies." This is also known as Strong AI. Your second 'school' of AI is known as a 'Expert Systems' which are defined as a system designed to emulate the decision making of a human expert in a specific domain. For instance, Deep Blue, the famous chess 'AI' is an Expert System in the domain of Chess; it emulates the decisions of human Chess experts. this is also known as Weak AI, and Narrow AI. In this system, we are defining AI based on whether or not it possesses human-like cognitive abilities. Communication Ability You could classify AI into groups of those that can pass the Turing Test and those that cannot. One isn't necessarily better than the other; i.e. just because something does not communicate to humans doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. What 'Type' of 'Mind' it has You can classify AI into what I would describe as what 'type' of 'mind' it has: 

i.e. if you had two stones, you cannot arrange them into rows and columns to form a rectangle; therefore two is a prime number. Unless you can find a way to make 2 stones form a rectangle, it is a prime number. We can use this to address the 'philosophy' aspect of your question, you are effectively attacking the 'divisible by other numbers' aspect of your definition of prime, however my definition dispenses entirely with the concept of dividing by anything, and still gives us a complete list of 'prime numbers' which includes '2'. Even in a theoretical universe where the number of numbers less than x is indeterminable (i.e. there may or may not be numbers less than x) it is still possible to independently verify whether or not x is prime using this method, therefore the 'primeness' of 2 can be verified regardless of the fact there are no whole numbers between 1 and 2 In fact, we can prove this is in our own mundane universe with an experiment: 

Whilst I agree with most of what he says, I believe that there is potentially a 'Straw-Man' hiding in here. 

We also have 'Axioms' in science, like we do in mathematics. Some of these 'Basic Assumptions' are things like "There are natural causes for things that happen in the world around us", "Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes.", and "There is consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world."
