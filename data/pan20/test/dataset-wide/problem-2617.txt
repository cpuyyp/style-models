I can't deny myself (the 'I' or the consciousness of being myself). Can you? If you say "Yes", you would never have asked your question. In other words, this question must be asked unconsciously. If you say "Yes" again, why can't you say the consciousness for asking this question is somewhere else? So.... One can deny everything except consciousness (though actually it is Pure consciousness). But there is a chance for denial of consciousness until that person meets a great Guru. In other words, if he says so, that means he has never met such a person. In short, I would say, if you try to weld the terms 'consciousness' and 'illusion' the latter burns completely without leaving out a sign of its 'particles'. Our sense organs will become useless after our death, so it cannot show you the 'real knowledge'. The real knowledge must be beyond all the knowledge acquired through our sense organs. 

When I was a kid, I remind that I had a strange type of game - I was mostly concerned of annoying other persons. Whenever they assumed something, I asked why, and then when they aswered, I asked why again, and then I kept asking why until the person was annoyed. There was a point where the person could not provide an answer to the why's, I always wondered if our knowledge behaves this way: This way of having an infinite series of why's and at some point, a nullity of answers. So, is this infinity of questions a problem somehow? Have someone thought about it? 

If the following answers are strictly related to one particular religion only, you may ignore this. If you can find anything sensible/true, you may search other websites and test them. 

Even thieves show interest in truth; but in very low-level truths (or facts) only. Can't we treat the browsing on the Internet as another aspect of people's interest in the Truth. These low-level truths are only 'twigs of truth'. Some people try to find its 'branches'. Scientists try to find its 'trunk' and philosophers its 'roots'. If your statement is about the interest in living an honest life, one can find so many low-level reasons for it. (Eg: Science puts forward many alternatives to overcome the problems they face in their life. So, the development of science and the people's faith in its findings lost many people's interest in the truth.) The vasanas and milieus compel them to stay away from the truth. (It is easy to live in a dishonest way than in an honest way.) Most people don't know that this human life is precious. If they have a great vision or a great goal in their life, they will certainly pursue it. Though people have different beliefs about posthumous life, even some people who strongly believe in it are interested in some activities only. But what they think as good activities as a part of their beliefs may not be so when viewing from another point. I mean, this beliefs are not enough for making interest in the Truth. Even heaven and hell are also bound by time, space, and causality. But when they try to know themselves and are aware of the cycle of birth and death they will never lose interest in the Truth. Conventional truths sometimes create bondages, but the Ultimate Truth doesn't. You may get good examples from your life-experience (for the first part). Actually the reverse statement is more correct--'He who realized the Ultimate Truth is liberated from all bondages including the endless cycle of birth and death.' 

I am a student of mathematics, that afirmation of the question I propose seems plausible to me. But I remember that some days ago, I was talking to a friend and he said that such terms are not exactly consequences of a quantitative method. Is that feasible? I don't remember perfectly if he said that one is not consequence of another or if it was about somethings that don't need to be quantified. But I would like to know about my initial question. Note: I have no idea of what tags should be used for this question - any edit is welcome. 

3. To acquire something means that what you are trying to acquire is not with you now. If you say 'I am acquiring truth', implies that the truth is something that excludes you. What would be the case when each and every person considers others in the same way...? This implies that 'that truth' is incomplete and so what you are trying to acquire is not the Truth. Only because of this reason, my answer to this question is 'Yes'. But it can be realized. If you are not stern, many things will take you away from your aim while you are trying to make it practical. Actually, this is something more than practical. Refer these quotes--1.“Realization is not acquisition of anything new nor is it a new faculty. It is only removal of all camouflage.” 2.“All that is required to realize the Self is to “Be Still.” 

I guess everyone knows Plato's allegory of the cave. He assumes people are in caves and then, he suggests that there is a possibility of "going out of the caves", gaining several nice properties with this. Do we have evidence that he noticed that we could "get out of a cave" and still be inside another "cave"? And that there could be an arbitrary number of nested caves? 

I don't understand how the fail to settle all disputes implies that one couldn't settle many of them. The only possibility I see is using the meaning of "all" as "all disputes of a certain class" as such that this class does not contain all possible disputes. 

I believe that Rishis hadn't said a clear-cut answer to this question. So I think it is very difficult to say an answer to this question very easily. As I said above we should use our power of discrimination properly. 

To avoid confusion let me use beingness instead of being. Like other things, if beingness also undergoes changes, we cannot name it beingness. If the word you used as 'being' depends on our sense organs, for convention you'd better say that it exists/existed for a certain period. If we said that something had a beingness, we can no longer say that now it has no beingness. To test this, you can use your commonsense or refer to the Bhagavad Gita. 

Suppose you have two theories: T₁,T₂. Each one has a proposition that makes the other become contradictory. Question 1: Is it always possible to find a theory T₃ which conciliates both theory, that is: "removes the contradiction"? Question 2: Supposing the answer to the first question is affirmative, does it imply that we can prove anything to be true? I know the answer with logic, this will depend on the axioms and rules of inference of the logic you are using. But how they face this problem with Derrida's conception of languange? 

Philosophy can make up (or it is for making up) the limitations of science. So philosophy is closer in finding the Ultimate Truth (as well as conventional truths). I don't know the present state of classical music in all countries. But it is perfect in some countries (Eg.India). In india, "the previous guy work" was scientific and precious. So I would like to say 'Yes'. I have heard about its miracles. For some basics, read about Indian classical music. It is not because of lack of time. Some philosophers have termed that knowledge as Vedanta -- means "the end of knowledge".
