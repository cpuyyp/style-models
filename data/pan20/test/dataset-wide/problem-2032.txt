It's not uncommon but they vary a lot and the devil is in the details. Depending on the country/jurisdiction, there might legal restrictions curtailing the enforceability of such a non-compete clause: 

Yes, that's what the text you quoted means (but then I am not a lawyer and have no idea what other German statutes or case law might be relevant – note that this is the German implementation of an EU directive). But even if taking all 30 minutes before the six-hour mark is not mandated by the law, it does not seem forbidden either (“Die Ruhepausen […] können […] aufgeteilt werden.”) So your employer is probably within its rights by implicitly forcing you to take your breaks in that way, as long as you never have to work more than 6 hours in one chunk and have at least 30 min break in total (what the employer has to do is plan a break, not let you take it whenever you want). At the same time, it's not uncommon to see time tracking systems that implement such requirements incorrectly and your recourses are typically limited (I have seen much worse, to the point that it became a contentious issue in the organization). Employees or their representatives can ask to have the system fixed but until then, you don't necessarily have any basis to be compensated for those 15 min. Now that you know how the system works, it's up to you not to lose them, for example by taking a 30 min break in one chunk. You also have to ask yourself if you really want to make a fuss about this (and if you do, it's probably best not to do it alone but, e.g., through a trade union). 

It seems like you should look out primarily for yourself here, and your own career mobility, rather than your current department. It is very standard for companies to have potential for transfer within the business. It is actually to their benefit, since it increases overall employee retention and keeps experienced workers' knowledge within the company. Some of the concerns that you brought up are really your current manager's responsibility to take care of. Redundancy needs to be built into process, such that if one employee leaves or is out for an extended period of time, such as illness, someone else can fill in. If you are concerned that your Line Manager might think poorly of you, you might quietly submit your application for the position and progress through the system that way. At this point, there is no certainty yet that you might receive an offer. It could not hurt to obtain more information about the position in the meantime. This sounds like you are at the top of your career potential for this position and are at the stepping point on to the next level. I would not hesitate to take that step. Good luck! 

I agree with the statement to document the issue and report it to management. In addition, some social engineering on your part might help you out, from the standpoint of prevention. Are you required to coordinate with this person on every opportunity? If not, don't tell them about the sales opportunities or your plans for action on those accounts. They cannot sabotage any opportunity or action that they do not know exists. Also, don't be afraid to take full ownership of a project, if you can. Do not rely on this person for assistance, because it seems like instead of getting help, you have to take additional time to perform damage control. Take over full responsibility for the project. If that means that you have to learn new skills, then do so. In the long run, you will get full credit for your work. And do not ask for permission to take ownership of the project. Just do it. You mention that he is not your supervisor. Perhaps you can make the direct communications to the client and report the results to management. Try to bypass this guy, if you can. Good luck! 

Many useful answer but I feel another perspective might be useful. Sounding arrogant is to some extent in the eye of the beholder. In some cultures (national and/or corporate) sharing knowledge or correcting a superior might simply be unacceptable. One answer is therefore: Realize this, try to accept it and do your job as good as you can. If you feel this is impairing your own development or future career or if there are legal ramifications or risks for third parties, this might not be the right course of action but ultimately you are not responsible for the whole company and all your coworkers. Besides, is your team unable to function or deliver anything of value? Can you explain some practical benefits to your preferred approach (as opposed to it being new and considered a “best practice”)? If not, it would suggest that your coworkers' approach is good enough. 

In countries/jurisdictions where the law does not provide for clear limitations like this, employers might be tempted to slap a broad non-compete clause on everybody's contract – that might be the source of the story you read – but that does not mean they would necessarily bother with enforcing it in each and every case. And I currently work for a very large company, in a locale where the rules are pretty lax, yet my contract only has a very reasonable non-compete clause so don't let this stop you from applying wherever you want. If that's really a show-stopper for you, you can always ask about it after you got an offer and before handing in your notice for your current job. Finally, a friend of mine once switched from an employer to another one that was clearly covered by her non-compete agreement but her new employer was willing to cover any damages/penalty she might have to pay for breaking her contract and approached her former employer to negotiate directly with them. 

I work in a large multinational which is experimenting in new forms of project management. We have invested a great deal of trust to an individual who is training members of staff. He was hired based on his achievements in a particular field including working directly with a Founder of an agile technique including helping to write numerous publications. I recently returned from an industry conference whereby the founder and other agile heavyweight speakers said they have never heard of the project manager and flatly denied that the manager had ever collaborated on pieces of work. I find myself in a hard spot because the manager now has a prominent position which he uses to evangelize agile techniques to an audience new to the Agile industry as well as name-drop frequently and openly about his non-existent experience. He does have a verifiable track record of project management but not anywhere near the level he has been claiming. Small agile projects have been embellished as "bringing Agile to the entire FTSE 100 Organisation" etc. The manager is in a different department from me. I more concerned that his links to the Founder are fabricated. 

The first number to be raised in these circumstances becomes the anchor. That is, all negotiation will be based on the anchor point and moving either above or below. $URL$ I am typing on a phone so this won't be lengthy and a number of other posters will give you the etiquette side of the conversation but I would stress 3 brief things. The first is, know what you are worth. If you have a figure in your mind and the company are not willing to meet it; are you prepared to leave? If not, you are in a considerably weakened negotiating position although your company does not sound combative on the issue so it's not a bad thing. Just something to be aware of. The second is - whichever number you pick use the sentence 

I would agree with the responses above to document the events that occur and report them to your manager. In addition, my advice would be to know who your supervisor is and focus on doing whatever they tell you to do regarding your tasks. Any manager appreciates an employee who earns the company a profit. I have had similar situations in the past, where coworkers were behaving in an inappropriate and discriminatory manner towards me. In addition to reporting the behavior, I focused strongly on the work at hand and out-performed my colleagues. Eventually, you will look better than your coworkers and earn a promotion, and they will have to respect you more. So, document, report, and focus on performing your job well. 

Perhaps consider taking a college course on diversity in the workplace. Many schools offer them. Check for programs in women's studies or race/ethnicity studies, and they will likely have a course that is focused on diversity and employment. Also, focus your research on information from peer-reviewed journals. These are certified as meeting the research standards of their respective fields and are frequently available through your local university's library. Diversity is a volatile field, and you want to ensure that your information is grounded in science, rather than being based on someone's opinion. A few textbooks that include information on gender, race, and working include: Paula J. Dubeck & Dana Dunn, "Workplace/Women's Place" - also includes information about race. Contains more direct information about how to set up a workplace to promote productivity, prevent discrimination, and increase retention (turnover is higher for oppressed groups). Teresa Amott & Julie Matthaei, "Race, Gender, and Work" - more focused on a historical, policy perspective
