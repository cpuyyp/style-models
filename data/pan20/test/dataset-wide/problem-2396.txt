I remember going to my first Theravada Vihara years back and thanking them for coming to teach westerners. The monk there made a great point in response, they came because the area had a population of Sri Lankan people who requested them to come, not for some grand vision to bring dhamma to the west. Very few monastics, at least in the Theravada, came out of a desire to spread dhamma in the west. they came as their laity moved west. We are the secondary beneficiaries of that movement. Ive been to that Vihara many times and it is obvious that while they do teachings in English, their man focus is there laity from Sri Lanka. Now there is at least one person who has dedicated the last 30 years of his life to bringing dhamma to the west, and that's Bhante G(author of mindfulness in plain English) who created Bhavana Society. While most Viharas are places for Sri Lankans to come and socialize, Bhavana Society is a no nonsense meditation center that people visit from across the world. This is the kind of place a westerner wants to be and is fully part of the community. This is the type of place to find. 

It can not be trivial. If it were trivial, then it would not have any power whatsoever to cure our suffering or pull us out of this endless cyclic existence. It can not be mere word games or simply an intellectual philosophical exercise. If it were, then again it would not have any ability to end our suffering. It can not mean that nothing exists. If we come to the conclusion that nothing exists, then there can be no clearer guidepost saying “turn around!” as it is stated over and over in the Dharma that this is manifest evidence that the reasoning on emptiness has gone astray. Still, it must be something that can be inferred from reasoning. It is not a completely obscure phenomena. 

I believe this reasoning is basically equivalent to Chalmer's Hard Problem of Consciousness. To be clear, I think it is a hard problem for scientific reductionists who believe that consciousness can be reduced to physical matter and energy arranged in a specific way. On the other hand, it is also equivalent in a different formulation to another famously hard problem: Descarte's famous mind/body problem which assumes the dichotomy of mind/body above and then asks if these are of such fundamentally different natures, then how do they interact? It would seem that positing any mechanism of interaction would betray the original assumption: that they are so fundamentally different that one could never give rise to the other... that they could never touch if you will. Which leads to the question: what is the substantial cause of an instance of consciousness? 

About the doctrine of the 31 realms of existence. I have a few questions, because science, especially the theory of evolution, makes a good argument for categorizing humans as animals. 

"So this raises a dilemma. Continue being gentle and compassionate with loving kindness, and get eaten. Or react harshly when necessary and risk darkening ourselves. Or, is there a proper middle path?" Buddha was actually very clear on that subject. As in The Simile of the saw: 

Don't philosophize about past lives. You were born a human being, that in itself is a condition for old age, sickness and death (and all other types of suffering). As for the remedy the Buddha stated 

Vipassana means 'seeing clearly'. That means you cannot practice Vipassana, because it is the result of the practice. Likewise if you practice Samatha, you don't sit down and become calm & one-pointed right away. The practice and the result are not the same. In order to practice Vipassana Bhavana (= development of insight) you would traditionally use the instructions from the Satipatthana Sutta. The foundation/object of this practice is not whatever comes up. There are 4 things you should be mindful of (body, feelings, mind, mind objects). All necessary instruction can be found in this guide: How to Meditate 

And probably a number of other views that I've missed completely or misunderstood. Myself, I'm somewhere between 6, 7, and 8, I guess, but I struggle with this. Was rebirth introduced in the First or Second Turnings, and why did the Buddha teach it? To my mind, unquestionably it was taught and introduced. I think the Buddha taught it because it was/is a conventional truth and the Buddha taught the truth. Would any of the Buddhist doctrines, excluding karma and rebirth, fail to make sense without rebirth? Yes, I think there are obvious logical problems and inconsistencies that present if you deny the truth of rebirth. For instance, as BodhiWalker mentions above one could seek the end of suffering by merely ending this current life. Even more problematic, one could "liberate" others from suffering by murdering sentient beings painlessly. That's monstrous and I want nothing to do with it. I want to make quite clear, I'm sure this is not what others have in mind when denying or glossing the truth of rebirth. I'm emphatically not concluding that those who deny or gloss the truth of rebirth are murderous monsters, just that denying or glossing the truth of rebirth presents logical problems that I don't see a way around. Anyway, I think Venerable Thanissaro Bhikkhu's article above is excellent and highly recommend reading it many times and contemplating these questions. 

As a Theravadan ive made the mistake of thinking Buddha Nature is just "everyone's ability to become awakened". There is apparently more to it then that but im in no way qualified to explain that as I have much to learn about it myself. As for Theravada it is true as far as I have seen in my years of study and practice that "buddha nature" is not taught. However the Buddha says many times in the suttas that everyone has the ability to become awakened bases on their own effort and practice in this very life, so in that sense everyone has a "buddha nature". Also it may be important to note the differences between arahants and buddhas between the traditions. In Theravada the only difference between a buddha and an arahant is that a buddha finds the path on their own when it has been lost, there is no difference between a buddha and an arahant in terms of wisdom/ability etc in Theravada, not so in Mahayana. 

"And how is a monk one with a sense of Dhamma? There is the case where a monk knows the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions.[1] If he didn't know the Dhamma — dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer sessions — he wouldn't be said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. So it's because he does know the Dhamma — dialogues... question & answer sessions — that he is said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. This is one with a sense of Dhamma. 

This is a very interesting question and one I've been pondering as well! What follows is speculative and more based on reasoning than any specific teaching so please take with a big heap of salt... otoh I can't see how it obviously contradicts what is taught in my tradition? First, I want to make a distinction between karma and the ordinary mechanics of the world. I don't think it can be said that karma drives the process of a maple seed turning into a maple tree. Why? Because karma is created by intention and action and maple trees are not sentient beings. And yet they age and are subject to causes and conditions. In a similar fashion, I think it is important to separate out the notion of karma from ordinary cause and effect or the mechanics of the world. Now, one interesting thing to observe is that when a being is enlightened or achieves liberation in this very life the aggregates continue. It is not like upon achieving enlightenment that the body winks out of existence any more than the mind winks out of existence. Not only would that violate the conservation of energy ... it simply isn't the way we observe things to be. It would violate what is known to the world. Indeed, even after an enlightened or liberated being dies in this very life their corpse remains. Not only does it remain, but with the break up of the body the atoms that were formerly a part of the body of an enlightened being continue. Conservation of energy and matter is observed. The question could be reformulated maybe as what drives the aging of an enlightened beings body and mind after achieving enlightenment, but before death? For me, I find it inadequate to say that an enlightened beings aging and sickness are caused by past karma for various reasons. Rather, I think that karma must be extinguished upon the pacification of all afflictions. An enlightened or liberated being is no longer subject to suffering and thus past non-virtuous karma that is the cause of suffering must have been extinguished and laid down. In exactly the same way that an enlightened or liberated beings corpse does not wink out of existence the moment they die I think neither does the mind. Anyway, I post this not so much as an answer that others should rely upon because undoubtedly I'm very confused or made some egregious error. Rather, I'm hoping someone can help me learn something :) 

I think this kind of question is very speculative. The Buddha always stressed that thinking/worrying about future and past should be avoided. Instead it would be wise to examine the present. 

A long live doesn't necessarily mean being happy all the time. Moreover, you can't control how long your live will be ("Live is uncertain, Death is certain."). So being concerned about how long your going to live isn't that useful, because it's not really up to you. If you want to know how to live most healthy, you'd need to ask a doctor or somebody else. But even then you have no assurance. If you want to use the Buddha's approach, you might need to reconsider your goals. You say you want to live as long as possible and to have as much pleasure in your live as possible. Your actual question probably is something like "How to live as happy and peaceful as possible?", but you're already assuming that having a long and pleasant live is what leads to happiness and peace. According to Buddhism it is wrong view to believe that the more pleasant experiences you have, the happier you will become. The hard truth is that pleasant things don't lead to lasting happiness. You can test this out: If you're listening to music it's quite pleasant, there is no doubt that this pleasure is a kind of happiness. But try listening to the same music for 3 hours (or longer), are you then still happy? If nice music was the cause of happiness, then the more you listen to it, the happier you should get, because this is how cause and effect work, right? But in reality it's not like this. In fact you probably would get quite agitated and frustrated after listening that long to the same music without break. The whole point of Buddhist teaching is that if you make your happiness dependent upon the things you experience (pleasantness of sights, sounds, smells, touches, tastes and thoughts), then suffering will follow you inevitable. Because pleasant feelings change and you can't control what's pleasant and what's not. 

As far as I can tell the "Animal realm" includes insects. It is a sentient being and I don't see why they wouldn't be a part of samsara. 

I would say not at all, but in all honestly I bet any of us can take our own perspective and pick the Buddhas words to make our argument. Seems to be from my perspective that the Buddha mostly stayed out of politics with the rare exception of counseling kings who came to him and even then the advice was mostly about the ruler themselves performing skillful actions just like the rest of us, not about grand political maneuvers. I actually wonder if the scope of this question is even appropriate for this website, considering it is a basic Q&A about Buddhism and this could turn into a political debate. 

I think that the reason you only find references to homosexual activity in the vinaya is BECAUSE the vinaya is the only place where there is a need to be specific regarding sexual acts... Oral sex is still oral sex whether it's performed by a man or a woman, an animal or even yourself. In the Suttas, the teachings, it doesn't matter if you are attracted to the opposite sex, same sex, etc. it's all about craving,clinging, desire, attachment, and aversion all underpinned by ignorance. These come from the mind and go far deeper then sexual identity and attraction. As for Homosexuality and the Theravada tradition, buddhanet.net strikes again: $URL$ 

You are knowingly causing the suffering of sentient beings who want to be happy just as you do. Your actions are non-virtuous and you should stop. Thinking that you can continue doing so and somehow ameliorate your continued bad actions will only cause you to incur heavier debt than already incurred. This is necessarily so because if you convince yourself that you can ameliorate it somehow, then using this as an excuse you will continue to cause harm to yourself and others. All sentient beings wish to be happy and to avoid suffering - even insects - just as you do. Does that mean that all beings know how to achieve happiness? Clearly not! To take an extreme example, human beings who wantonly spread terror by killing and torturing in the name of religious zealotry, obviously do not know how to achieve happiness. They are extremely - to the nth degree - unskillful in the method they are using to try and achieve happiness. Nonetheless, these people wish to be happy and to avoid suffering just as you do. It is exactly the same for all sentient beings. When you are in a hole... stop digging. Only after you have done this should you make a plan to get out of the hole. Short of this, I think Andrei's answer is excellent. If you practice what Andrei suggests with sincerity and with a mind aspiring for compassion I have no doubt you will stop your non-virtuous actions which will be very good for your - and the insects! - aims to be happy and avoid suffering.
