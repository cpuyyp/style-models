The moon is rotating wrt to the sun. As the moon rotates, the longitude of the terminator increases linearly. Treating the moon as being at "great distance, so the moon appears as an orthographic projection, the position of the middle of the terminator varies sinusoidally, it moves fastest when the moon is at first or third quarter. In the orthographic projection, the longitude and latitude $(\lambda,\varphi)$ are mapped to (x,y) by $$ \begin{align} x &= R\,\cos\varphi \sin\left(\lambda - \lambda_0\right) \\ y &= R\big(\cos\varphi_0 \sin\varphi - \sin\varphi_0 \cos\varphi \cos\left(\lambda - \lambda_0\right)\big) \end{align}$$ For points on the equator, and treating the central longitude $\lambda_0$ as the lunar prime meridian, and a scale of R=1, that simplifies to $x = \sin(\lambda)$. As the terminator moves, its longitude increases linearly, so x varies sinusoidally. Correcting for elliptical orbits, librations of the moon and a general perspective view would only marginally alter this. 

They are not real. The images used in the animation use a mosaic of photographs taken by an orbiting satellite, the Clementine orbiter. This satellite has a polar orbit, and so returns images in strips that run roughly north-south. Due to variations in lighting between orbits, when the strips are joined together, there are artefacts at the joins. The whole moon image from a ground-based telescope doesn't have such artefacts. The lunar orbiter view was used as it covers the whole moon, including the far-side. As the moon orbits Earth, it appears to wobble (an effect known as libration.) By starting with a whole moon map, and then projecting it to a sphere, this libration can be simulated. You couldn't do that with a single ground-based image. 

Below is a small GIF made from a small subset of images contained in the original 36MB GIF found at $URL$ as I just found in the Sky and Telescope article Asteroid Florence Has Two Moons. Although it's tempting to interpret the image as an optical image, I belive this is pulsed-doppler data from the Goldstone Deep Space Network center. I am guessing that one axis is range (delay) and the other is doppler shift. Still I can't figure out the geometry that would produce an "eclipse" (in this case the moon passing behind the larger asteroid) with it disappearing so "far" from the asteroid. Could someone help me out here? Is one axis delay (time) and the other doppler shift? One can start with this description but there is more to it than is discussed there. below: "A radar image shows asteroid 3122 Florence and tiny echoes from its two moons. Here is an animation that shows them more clearly. The direction of the radar illumination (and thus the direction toward Earth) is at the top." From here. NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This is a small subset of the frames contained in the original 36 MB GIF, and the size has been decreased by a factor of 2 in order to fit in SE's 2 MB limit. 

Our moon is special. Other planets have relatively much smaller moons. The other rocky planets either have very small moons (Phobos and Deimos are probably captured asteroids) or no moons at all. The giant planets have a central system of moons that orbit prograde around their equator, and a wider system of satellites that orbit in many different orbits, and are not aligned to the planet or to each other. Our Moon is the only moon that orbits roughly in the plane of the ecliptic, and the only one which shows the particular orbital dynamics in which the inclination varies as the ascending node rotates. This suggests that the formation of the moon was special, not part of normal planetary formation. The suggestion is that the moon was formed in a giant impact. 

Every so often someone will note that a "star" is a ball of plasma that is supported by nuclear reactions at its core, and so technically neutron stars and white dwarfs are stellar remnants, and not stars. The technical term is therefore "star". And if you think that could be ambiguous then just spell it out: "Stars with supported by fusion reactions"/"Stars, excluding stellar remnants" 

If you like Python you can reproduce these fairly easy. The package Skyfield uses the same NASA JPL Ephemerides as the JPL Horizons site but is easier to use. You can see that 95% of this script is just making it look nicer and getting the position of the planets is just a few lines. Here are the results for only 6,000 years, a much smaller period than shown in Cohen and Hubbard 1965, so Neptune only makes a small segment of its 25,000 cycle, near one end where it's "moving" slowly. The first set of plots are in inertial (non-rotating) J2000 ecliptic coordinates, and the second is rotating with the average orbital motion of Neptune, so that Neptune appears nearly fixed. The first plot shows Neptune-Pluto separation versus calendar year. The minimum in this period seems to be around year -77, with a distance of 2.65 billion km or 17.73 AU. 

In a close-orbiting binary pair, a small but significant fraction of the light from each star falls upon the other, and the result has to be carefully modeled to simulate the observed spectrum of the system as it rotates. One effect is that each stars radiation will non-uniformly heat the surface of the other star and alter its thermal radiation, but here I'm asking about light from one star being scattered or diffusely reflected by the other. How is this scattered/reflected light calculated, and roughly what is the spectral reflectance? Of course each star will be different, so one example or maybe two would be sufficient. We often treat stars as blackbodies as an approximation, suggesting that stars have low albedo, but at some depth the electron density will be high enough so that the plasma frequency reaches visible wavelengths, increasing reflectivity, though that may be too deep to matter. 

If a planet is 1000 light years away, there is no way that we could be sure that there is life on it "now". However there is a probabilistic argument: Life takes many millions of years to develop, and the chance of a disaster being so great as to sterilise a planet is very small: case in point, the Earth hasn't been sterilised since the last common ancestor of all living things existed, nearly 4 billion years ago. There is no way of knowing that life would continue to exist on a planet 1000 light years away during the many millennia that it would take for a probe to reach the distant planet. Interstellar travel would take so long that we have to accept that no matter when we begin, we will not finish in our lifetime, and so we would do so for the benefit of our descendents. Its not clear what you mean by "evolution is 10x faster" since evolution doesn't have a clearly defined speed. 

The motivation for this question comes from this question. A star is named in the occultation prediction shown below, from AsteroidOccultations.com's News & Announcements for 2014 MU69 on . I believe that the star is in the Omega Centauri cluster, and I believe it is between +12 and +14 visual magnitude roughly. The name given in the prediction is The location shown in the prediction is but according to Wikipedia the coordinates of the cluster are roughly . I need help understanding why the two coordinates seem so different (am I misunderstanding the prediction?) and finding out how to look up this particular star’s visual magnitude by using its name. I’ve tried a few quick searches but realized that I was over my head and not likely to get the right information. 

The Phys.org article Cosmic filament probes our galaxy's giant black hole links to A Nonthermal Radio Filament Connected to the Galactic Black Hole? which discusses (among other things) the importance of achieving high dynamic range to study these filaments in the proximity of the strong emission associated with Sgr A*. It mentions the fluctuation of radio intensity from Sgr A* on time scales as short as five minutes (as well as to instrumental time-varying effects that also require attention and calibration). The paper refers to Zhao et al. 2016, which in turn links to Zhao et al. 1999. But so far I can't track down either the nature of the short term variations seen in the radio brightness of Sgr A* nor the mechanism. What is the nature of this variation (amplitude, power spectrum, any periodicity?) and what are the proposed mechanisms? 

Here is how the tides move the moon away from the Earth: The moon orbits the earth, and there is a difference in gravitational force between the the side of the Earth nearest the moon, and the side far from the moon. This difference in force tends to pull the Earth into a oval shape with its long axis pointing towards the moon. But the Earth is also spinning, and this spinning moves the axis of the oval forward, so the oval doesn't point towards the moon, but a little ahead of it. So there is a bump on the Earth, and it is permanently a little in front of the moon. This bump has mass and it pulls the moon towards it, So the moon is being pulled forwards. The moon pulls the Earth back. So the Earth's spin is slowed, but the moon gains energy and moves a little further from the Earth. The moon has also been slowed down to the extent that the same side always faces Earth, and it will remain locked like this. Gravitational waves, on the other hand, imply an emmision of energy from the binary system, and as energy is lost, the black holes spiral in. There are no tides on black holes because there is nothing there to be pulled into an oval shape. The event horizon is not a solid surface. The mass of a black hole is concentrated entirely at the singularity, there is no structure to be deformed into a bump. 

Why does the Earth's orbital eccentricity oscillate with a period of about 100,000 years? What would be the simplest set of conditions and/or fewest body system that would lead to this particular type of periodic variation in eccentricity? 

It's the "likely brown dwarf companion" I'd like to ask about. The paper with the catchy title "The First Science Results from SPHERE: Disproving the Predicted Brown Dwarf around V471 Tau" Hardy et al. (2015) SPHERE is a new, advanced adaptive optics system at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The image below (figure 3) is part of the argument, and the suggestion is that if there is no brown dwarf seen in the band between the two white circles, then the predicted brown dwarf does not exist. This would be interesting, because an alternative explanation for the slow, periodic drift in the eclipse timing would have to be found. One possibility is the Applegate Mechanism which I don't understand, but may ask a separate question after this. Back to Vaccaro 2015, section 9, titled "On the Reality of the Third Star" is over six pages of discussion of the underlying assumptions, and if I understand it correctly provides several possible ways in which a suitable brown dwarf could exist but not show up in the SPHERE image. In essence disproving the existence disproof. I would like to know: Is my understanding of the current situation correct? Have there been more recent developments?
