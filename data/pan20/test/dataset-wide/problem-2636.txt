i.e. if you had two stones, you cannot arrange them into rows and columns to form a rectangle; therefore two is a prime number. Unless you can find a way to make 2 stones form a rectangle, it is a prime number. We can use this to address the 'philosophy' aspect of your question, you are effectively attacking the 'divisible by other numbers' aspect of your definition of prime, however my definition dispenses entirely with the concept of dividing by anything, and still gives us a complete list of 'prime numbers' which includes '2'. Even in a theoretical universe where the number of numbers less than x is indeterminable (i.e. there may or may not be numbers less than x) it is still possible to independently verify whether or not x is prime using this method, therefore the 'primeness' of 2 can be verified regardless of the fact there are no whole numbers between 1 and 2 In fact, we can prove this is in our own mundane universe with an experiment: 

The problem you're having with that statement is that it's ambiguous. I suggest the follow two possible interpretations of your statement, one of which is impossible, one is completely valid. I believe to understand it, you need to specify which meaning you mean. 

You're missing information on whether or not A AND C is representative of A and representative of B. I.e. it could be that A AND C represents 49% of A, and 49% of C, and that NONE of them are B. Let's try an example: 

You can't really identify a logical fallacy unless someone makes a claim, and the only claim your question describes is this: 

Although we take these things to granted, we do allow for them to be disproved or to proved to be lacking; if new evidence arises that does so; but we may not seek that evidence out. Many of these theories are proven 'beyond reasonable doubt' but may never be proved to be 'absolutely true' 

Dawkins presents this hypothetical argument without providing concrete examples of people actually using it. It is probably no coincidence, that even if has heard the argument used, he paraphrased it here in such a way that it is perfectly destroyed by his pre-prepared counter-argument, this is a classic straw-man. 

Facts includes the existence of all things, but also all provable properties and behaviors of all things. Imagine a universe made up of only a teacup and a hammer. Things: 

We could classify AI in an infinite number of other ways; some based on outcome, others based on how it works on a technical level. Here are some examples: Strong and Weak AI Your first 'School' of AI is probably Artificial general intelligence "(AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and a common topic in science fiction and future studies." This is also known as Strong AI. Your second 'school' of AI is known as a 'Expert Systems' which are defined as a system designed to emulate the decision making of a human expert in a specific domain. For instance, Deep Blue, the famous chess 'AI' is an Expert System in the domain of Chess; it emulates the decisions of human Chess experts. this is also known as Weak AI, and Narrow AI. In this system, we are defining AI based on whether or not it possesses human-like cognitive abilities. Communication Ability You could classify AI into groups of those that can pass the Turing Test and those that cannot. One isn't necessarily better than the other; i.e. just because something does not communicate to humans doesn't mean it isn't intelligent. What 'Type' of 'Mind' it has You can classify AI into what I would describe as what 'type' of 'mind' it has: 

the consequences of rejecting induction are being freed up to learn something better from Karl Popper. all your concerns come from basically taking a typical inductivist epistemology and then rejecting one central part (induction) and keeping the rest. what you need is a thoroughly non-inductivist epistemology which is built from the ground up to make sense without induction. that's what Popper offers. (so far there are no non-Popperians offering this). 

government should protect everyone, not just the weak. it should treat everyone equally instead of define a privileged class (e.g. those deemed "weak" by some criterion). the point of government is to protect men from force and keep that defensive force organized and careful instead of just a bunch of chaotic vigilante justice. defense against force (e.g. robbery or enslavement) is an important value for everyone (strong or weak). a hard part is who pays for this defense, and how much from each person? ideally funding would be voluntary. currently that isn't figured out yet. 

there's mysticism here. a simulation of a human is a human. it's the same thing. human minds are software running in a classical computer. that's what you already are – a computer running software. the hardware details don't matter to the computations. no soul or organic molecules required. an intelligence software program has to do certain things. included on the list is create knowledge. the only known knowledge-creating process is evolution. knowledge can be created through replication with variation and selection. (in the case of ideas this would more normally be called brainstorming and critical thinking to eliminate errors). software that does this within various parameters, and does a few other things, would be a thinking person. that's all there is to it. stuff like emotions are emergent properties of software, they aren't tied to souls, hardware made of organic molecules instead of silicon, etc 

check your premises about who is intelligent. anyway, the underlying issue is people disagree about stuff. there are lots of ideas out there. many of them conflict. sorting it out is hard. being intelligent and reasonable in no way prevents someone from making a mistake when judging some ideas that disagree. it's hard. a secondary issue is that people have bad methods of judging ideas. they're bad at discussing hard issues to conclusions. they don't really know how and they kinda wing it and mistakes are common. if anyone would like to improve at this, a good place to start is this book $URL$ or this discussion forum $URL$ 

What objective criteria can be used to judge philosophical refutations? Say for example that someone is writing a criticism of Karl Popper. What are ways to reject the criticism without getting into a detailed debate of the sort that this site doesn't allow? 

Your confidence in h1 will increase as you discover A that are B (and fail to discover any A that are not B) Your confidence in h2 will increase as you approach time t and fail to observe any A that are not B You may never observe any evidence of A becoming not B before t, so, in the absence of evidence, your confidence in h3 remains the same. 

Have a friend sit on the other side of a curtain with a box of tokens. have them pick a number of tokens (x) but not tell you how many they have picked. Ask them if they can form a rectangle with those tokens. Repeat the experiment, ensuring that at some point they choose 2 tokens 

How they were made You could classify AI into those that were developed 'by man' and those that were developed using evolutionary algorithms and/or machine learning. Deep blue, was programmed with a defined set of rules, whereas the Google AI 'DeepMind' that can win at 'Go' is much more of an evolutionary algorithm, and effectively taught itself to win. 

E.g. A = American Females, B = 'White', C = American Politicians An American Female is probably White, An American Politician is probably White, Therefore A Female American Politician is probably White Is obviously not necessarily true. Unless you add something like "American female politicians are probably white" 

Almost all scientific theories are taken 'for granted' we don't have to re-test them every time we come to a conclusion that relies upon them being true. I.e. if I want to test whether Ball A is bouncier than Ball B, I assume that the laws of motion apply equally to both balls, and that acceleration due to gravity is the same for both, etc.. 

We also have 'Axioms' in science, like we do in mathematics. Some of these 'Basic Assumptions' are things like "There are natural causes for things that happen in the world around us", "Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes.", and "There is consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world." 

You will, between you, confirm that 2 is a prime number. *: : By my definition 2x1 and 1x2 are 1-dimensional lines, not rectangles, and maps to our other definition of 'only divisible by 1 and itself'. If you think these are rectangles, you could add "... rectangle with both sides > 1 to the definition" 

*at this point, we're transcending things entirely and starting to talk about general facts. If we only cared about the objects in the universe, this would not be 'part of the universe' Wittgenstein also is talks a lot about hypothetical facts 

if you have no training, trying to rescue a drowning person with no equipment in deep water is actually dangerous. they aren't thinking straight and may drown you. but let's assume rescuing them is only a tiny risk. then go ahead. life is full of risks. if you ride in a car you could die in a car crash. trying to avoid all risk would be silly. you don't need a big benefit to accept a tiny risk. it's up to you if you want to rescue them. if you value human life, then that's a reason to do it since you want to see the guy healthy. if you like people in general, and you have a way to be a big help to someone at a low cost, then you can do it, go ahead. there's nothing in Objectivism to outlaw this (nor strictly mandate it. but Objectivists respect human life. so if it's a tiny cost, well, can't you afford it? Objectivists ought to be productive and be able to afford tiny costs to promote their values.). it's great to look for opportunities to trade mutual benefit in general. if you had more time maybe you'd ask him to pay you $10 to help. but you're in a hurry. you could ask him afterwards. i bet he'd give you $10 if you really care, or perhaps he'll volunteer some other reward for you. but $10 is so small compared to a life that it's not a big concern here, nor is the $10 of effort and risk this cost you. (it depends on the scenario parameters. if it costs you $5000 of effort and risk, then that could harm your own life, and he might not pay you back after you save him, so you have to consider what you want to do.) 

what else? the broader goal is to seek out criticisms of Popper, Rand and others that don't suck, and define some criteria for "don't suck" that will be acceptable on this site. 

Suffering involves having preferences and not getting them – basically not getting what you want (which requires wanting something). A rock has no preferences about what happens, so it can't suffer. (A rock doesn't want anything, so there's no opportunity to be disappointed.) The debate about animals should focus on whether or not they have minds involving preferences, rather than on mixing up physical pain nerves with mental suffering. Pain nerves could easily be included in a robot that (that is, we could make a robot with sensors to detect damage and send information about the damage to the software running the robot). Despite the word "pain" in the name, it has nothing more to do with suffering that sensors to detect pressure or light or sound. What people usually do is take attributes of animals that we see in today's video game enemies and then say "see! animals learn! animals are just like people!" An indication that animals do not have preferences is their inability to create new knowledge such as philosophies. This shows they are not universal knowledge creators like people. (Universal knowledge creator = able to create any knowledge that any knowledge creator can create. Think generic knowledge creator rather than specialized within some limits.) So an animal would have to either be a special case knowledge creator that somehow creates preferences but not philosophies, or else it can't suffer. There are no reasonable proposals for how this would work. The underlying problem is the people debating this topic largely aren't familiar with the key concepts like preferences, universality, and knowledge creation. If you want to understand universality better, and how knowledge is created, the best place to start is $URL$
