Go to your local bike shop or MEC and talk to them. You want a commuter - also called urban bikes. Thin(ish) tires so you aren't doing too much work, straight bars, hydraulic disk brakes would be good. Hub gears mean everything is internal so out of the weather - but if anything goes wrong you're stuck, dérailleur gears are fine if you clean the chain regularly. Get fenders, some good lights and some sort of bright waterproof. Cycle shorts look silly but are comfortable - this time of year in Toronto you will want something long and warm on top of them ! I would leave clipless pedals until you have a bit more confidence, riding in traffic is bad enough without also worrying about unclipping at each traffic light. When you do get clipless look for SPD (ie. mountain bike pedals) you can walk in the shoes more easily than the ones used for road bikes. You should be able to do 25km/h on a commuter sort of bike without too much effort so that's a 45min trip. Check out the route on Google maps or a local bike group site - finding side streets with no traffic and avoiding unnecessary hills makes a lot of difference. ps. One other tip - carry a bus ticket. Don't know about Toronto but most Canadian buses have bike racks. If you have a mechanical problem or the weather is just too bad you can always get a ride home. It makes commuting much more doable if you have a backup! 

Alternately - the chain links are 1 inch long, so measure 12 of them with a ruler, if they are more than 1/8inch longer than this then they are worn. You need to do this before it wears the rear cogs - it will cause the teeth to wear into sharp pointed spikes = need a new cassette. 

Just practice - preferably on a soft surface! You also need to be a little more aware, especially in traffic, think a little further ahead about where/when you will have to stop so you can be unclipped as you stop at the light. Suddenly braking to a halt and then having to stop and think before you unclip leads to falls. You should also get into the habit of always unclipping the same foot first - generally the kerb side - so it becomes automatic. 

The only other I would add is very good lights - even during the day. Drivers are going to be concentrating more on driving and probably have steamed up or partly covered windows. It's going to be darker/overcast - even during the day. Having rear flashing lights, and another one higher on your jacket/helmet is a good idea. Also check that you rear lights / reflectors haven't been covered by thrown up dirt. 

AFAIK any 9speed chain made for dérailleur should fit (single speed and hub gear chains are different) 9 speed chains are more expensive, they are thinner and not as common - so fewer cheap brands bother to make them, or stores to stock them BUT - the chain is an important part of the bike, a poor quality chain will stick, jump and wear the rear cassette teeth more quickly. You might not want to buy the very cheapest brand you can find. 

On a road surface you will be fine - try not to jump any kerbs ;-) Compared to the force when a bike with even a light rider goes over say a pothole or a jump the static load from a 120Kg rider is small. You might want to check the spoke tension reglarly - those are the parts that will suffer most. 

I buy all my bike lights from $URL$ - they are in HongKong but have free postage to Canada. You are just buying the same made in China stuff in the shops direct from the makers in China. Avoid the very cheapest stuff (destined for a Dollar store near you!) and check the reviews. edit: specifically for your trailer you can't beat this superflash from mec edit2: Lights switching off is normally a problem with the batteries not the switch. The flashing LED lights are microprocessor controlled and a fraction of second interuption in power resets the CPU. Check the batteries are a good contact, especially rechargeables which are a tiny bit shorter than Alkalines. You might have to bend the battery clips to make a good contact. 

The helmet itself is (probably) polysterene foam inner and a harder plastic shell, it's fine to wash this in water and some mild detergent (eg dish soap) You can try and wash the straps in hot soapy water. The problem is the pads. Usually washing the pads means that they come unglued, the surface layers separate from the inner cushion part. All you can do is keep the extra ones you get to size a new helmet and swap them. I don't know if pro racing type helmets come with multiple sets of replaceable straps and pads - but they should. 

If you ignore the strength in the tire walls (pretty much zero for bike tires) then the pressure (which = force / area ) multiplied by the contact area of the tire on the road must be the force you are putting on the road (ie. the weight of you and the bike). So for a large tire contact patch you need a lower pressure to support your weight, for a small area narrow tire you need a much higher pressure 

From the same manufacturer (or similar reputable) the safety is the same. This years model costs more, mostly to make up for selling last years model at half price! The top end ranges do have better ventilation, more comfortable or more adjustable padding and straps and have a logo on the box that says they were endorsed by this years Tour de France winner (unless they have just been caught taking drugs) Personally I buy last year's model from a reputable maker when the LBS has them on sale. Since helmets need to be replaced every few years (the plastic degrades) I don't worry about how long a better quality helmet will last. For me the padding and straps become horribly degraded from sweat long before the impact foam chemically degrades. I also buy two helmets for summer use and alternate them so they at least have a chance to dry out. Older ones get relegated to winter use with the padding removed when I wear a hat. 

It won't remove all chemical poisons - but neither will boiling - it can remove some depending on how soluble they are. See Water filter use And unless you are drinking from chemical waste spills for weeks on end I wouldn't worry, if one area is high in arsenic the next won't be ! 

Don't think I've seen quick release on kids bikes, you could always use a wing-nut to make them quicker to remove. Have you looked at the racks that just clip onto the back of the car (trunk/boot) - a lot quicker and easier than getting bikes into the back of the car. 

Granola/Power bars are cheap if you get the supermarket/Nature Valley ones, usually $10 for 32 double packs. Or you can make your own - lot of recipes on the net. Basically melt butter / sugar / honey and add anything oat / fruit / nut like, spread on a tray and put in fridge. 

A stretched chain will wear out gears (especially the rear cassette). You can see when this because the teeth get worn away to points - it's very obvious. But it's very unlikely you wore out a chain and gears in 1000 Km. What is more likely is that the cable has stretched slight from new and the derailuer is out of adjustment so it is putting the chain slightly between two gears. For adjustment details see - $URL$ To answer your question - No you aren't going to do any damage by using only one gear, if it's the correct gear. You are going to stretch the chain, and break more of them by being in too high a gear - just like in a car. You will also wear the chain faster by being in a 'bad' gear - eg on the inner front cog and the smallest back cog or (v.v.) 

If you are on-road I would have thought that even very small studs would work on ice, you only need to bite into the ice a little bit to get grip. If you need to get a grip in snow, or there is snow over the ice you would need longer spikes. But if there is snow over ice - I take the bus! 

I had an earlier version of the downtube about 5yrears ago. Mixed feelings, it has some nice features - folding pedals, nice chain guard, comfortable position and a bit of suspension to make up for the small wheels. Component quality left a bit to be desired, a nine speed no-name rear with friction twist grips to select! It folds - but only in a store under the stairs sense - if you need something that collapses into your pocket, get a Brompton. ps. When they used to sell on ebay and with a favorable exchange rate I paid around $250 

Look for courses at your local bike store. In the UK Edinburgh bike coop do excellent basic and more advanced course, as do MEC in Canada - both also do women only courses. Most local bike advocacy groups will do something similar, sometimes it's helpful to see how to do it. 

Fender Mudguard / mudflaps A must for winter cycling, apart from avoiding the 'skunk stripe' of mud up your back they keep a lot of water and mud from the vital bits of your bike. 

This is about $30 Two locks are always better than one - even if it just causes the thief to look at the next bike. 

Wear a helmet (not wanting to start the compulsory helmet debate), and gloves - every little bit helps. In theory let go of the handlebars would be good. I have had some painful long lasting wrist injuries from the wrenching of the handlbars as the other side of the bar hits the ground. Although you would have to have good reflexes to do it. I'm normally clipped in so a roll off a bike isn't really an option - but I have seen some impressive acrobatic dismounts off mountain bikes. 

Tricky question to answer. Is London better because it has lots of official bike lanes, bike stop signs and bike crossings? But it also has a huge amount of traffic and lots of heavy trucks and busses in small streets. Cambridge has little official support for bikes (it periodically bans them from areas of the city) but because there is relatively little traffic and a lot of bikes it's pretty good to cycle in. 

The speed is the number of cogs on the rear cassette. This matters because higher numbers of gears (esp 9speed) mean that the chain must be narrower to fit between them. Generally 6-7-8 speed chains are the same and 9 speed are thinner, more than 9 speed is a bit specialized. The length isn't as important because you will usually have to shorten the chain to fit your bike. The standard chain is 114 pins (56 links) but you almost never need to know this ( I had to look it up!). 

Montezoncolan on the Giro Italia is probably the toughest in a competition. Climbs 1200m in 10km, average about 12% and steep bits of 25% 

Really a comment to "I want proper data" but it was too long. There is no data that a ski helmet is safe for biking simply because there is no data that a bike helmet is safe for biking! What you do have is an assumption that if a bike helmet contains a certain thickness of an impact absorbing material and a ski helmet contains an equal or greater thickness than it will have the same impact absorbing effect. Similarly if bike helmets are required to survive a certain drop test impact and ski helmets are tested to an equal or greater impact then they are presumed to be equally safe. There are extra features that may make a bike helmet more or less safe - it may be more vunerable to splitting along vents yet may have a smoother surface to reduce snag risk - some of these may be included in the testing, some may not. And finally remember that the 'testing' isn't anything like as scientific as you might think. As described above it's normally just a anvil impact test. Alternatively the standards may just specify a certain thickness of a material. Whenever you see a size quoted in a safety standard you have to be slightly suspicious of the science which discovered something had to be exactly 25.4mm thick to be safe! 

A wicking polyester t-shirt eg. either coolmax or underarmour They aren't cheap but you can normally find some online retailer (especially in the US) doing a deal. Edit. apparently I'm a cheapskate! Expect to pay $10-15 for a short sleeve shirt. If you buy these brand names they will lost for many years. Only draw back is that the stuff does get smelly. Modern low temperature detergents don't kill the bugs - so if you are an extra smelly cyclist you have to soak them in bleach / bicarb / special running gear smell-killer occasionally. 

Chain gauge Measures the stretch of a chain to determine how worn it is and when to replace it. It's made to fit exactly between two separated links of a standard chain. 

Not really - the only 'scientific' thing they could really quote would be viscosity. What you care about is also how long it lasts, how much road crud it picks up, how it handles salt, how it is in rain - and all over the temperature range from -30C to +30C depending where you live. ps - ok with the new title, my algorithm is: go to my LBS, confess that I've just been using cheap 3in1 oil from the DIY store and ask what they use.
