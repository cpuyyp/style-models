Here's a justification of that last fact, which is long so probably disqualifies the argument (unless you deem it 'exercise for the reader'-worthy.) Let $f,g: A \rightrightarrows B$ be a diagram of sets and denote by $E$ the equalizer. Let $C$ be the coequalizer of $Y^A \leftleftarrows Y^B$. There is a natural map $C \rightarrow Y^E$ and it admits a section by 'extending a function by zero' where $0 \in Y$ is an element. On the other hand, given a function $h: A \rightarrow Y$ and an element $a \in A$ with $f(a) \ne g(a)$, we can always pick functions $h', k: B \rightarrow Y$ such that $h'$ extends $h$ along $f$ and $k$ extends $h$ along $g$ except that it sends $g(a)$ to $0$. In this way we can modify the equivalence class of a function until it is extended by zero. 

I hesitate to ask a question like this, but I really have tried finding answers to this question on my own and seemed to come up short. I readily admit this is due to my ignorance of algebraic geometry and not knowing where to look... Then I figured, that's what this site is for! Here's the short of it: 

Basically I'm looking for some intuition here. My logic being: if we know more about what kinds of questions a classification can answer then we will know more about the information contained in a classification. This, in turn, may provide clues for how to compute or construct such a classification (which is, of course, the next step in Balmer's program). (P.S. I've tagged the areas that I know of with classification theorems. If I'm forgetting some, do remind me in the comments Looks like there's a limit on tags :).) 

The dualizable objects in spectra are precisely the finite spectra (i.e. spectra of the form $\Sigma^{-k}\Sigma^{\infty}X$ where $X$ is a finite complex.) If you only want the statement 'dualizable objects are finite spectra and their retracts' there is a very formal proof that works in great generality: (a) the unit in $\mathsf{Sp}$ is a compact and $\mathsf{Sp}$ is closed symmetric monoidal, (b) every object in $\mathsf{Sp}$ is a filtered colimit of finite spectra; it follows that every dualizable object $X$ is compact and that the identity map $X \to X$ factors through a finite spectrum, hence $X$ is a retract of a finite spectrum. If you want to know that retracts of finite spectra are themselves finite, this is a bit less formal. One may argue directly or use (2) to show that, for $X$ dualizable, $H_*(X, \mathbb{Z})$ is finitely generated and projective, hence free and concentrated in finitely many degrees. Now inductively build cell complexes $Y_j$ and maps $Y_j \to X$ which are equivalences on $H_m(-,\mathbb{Z})$ for $m\le j$. This stops at some finite step and you get a map $Y \to X$ from a finite complex to $X$ which is an equivalence on $H_*(-,\mathbb{Z})$. But $X$ is connective (lots of ways to see this... for example, by (2) it's a retract of something connective), so this map is an equivalence by Hurewicz. (Note: for spaces, this argument works as soon as $X$ is simply connected, but can fail because of Wall's finiteness obstruction when $X$ is not simply connected). 

First consider the diagram $K_1$ obtained from $K$ by asking that every endomorphism be the identity. The right Kan extension to this step computes the 'fixed points' of each object under the action of the endomorphisms. If you want, you could do it one object at a time. Now begin collapsing parallel arrows one step at a time. This will always be a collapse of the desired type. Indeed, if $a\rightrightarrows b$ is a pair of arrows in $K_i$ and we collapse them to build $K_{i+1}$, then the overcategories $(K_{i+1})_{x/}$ will evidently have initial object $x$ if $x \ne a$. If $x = a$ then we'll be computing an equalizer. Now you've got a category $K_N$ where every object has only the identity endomorphism, and there is at most one arrow between any two objects. So you've got a poset! Now you can begin pruning exactly as you did in your example. Arrange the poset by height. Say it has height $n$. If $n$ is zero, then you've got a discrete poset- take the product. Otherwise, if you see two objects of height $(n-1)$ which hit an object of height $n$, form $K_{N+1}$ by collapsing those three objects to a point. This procedure replaces the three objects by the pullback and changes nothing else. Keep doing that until there are no more such objects of height $n$. Either you've decreased the height to $(n-1)$, or there are objects of height $n$ with only one thing of height $(n-1)$ hitting it. Taking each in turn, collapse those pairs to a point. This won't do anything except delete those height $n$ values from your diagram. Now you have something of height $(n-1)$. Repeat until you get down to height 0, then take the product of everything you see. 

Unless I'm mistaken (very possible), the answer is "yes". Here's the general idea: Every algebra may be obtained as the geometric realization of its bar complex. So we may reduce to the case of a free algebra, i.e. we need only construct some sort of natural weak equivalence $TX \rightarrow T'X$ preserving the multiplication structure. I don't know how to make precise this choice in a model category setting without using an ugly zig-zag and convoluted argument (but that is more likely due to ignorance than anything else.) If we replace all model categories in sight with their underlying $\infty$-category (I'm ignoring some set-theoretic issues here, or assuming that the categories are simplicially enriched), then the above becomes an actual proof: The Quillen adjunction induces an adjunction of $\infty$-categories, and in this case a natural isomorphism of functors admits an $\infty$-categorical inverse. So we can define the map $$ T \rightarrow T' $$ as the composition $$\alpha_R^{-1}L' \circ R\alpha_L: RL \rightarrow RL' \rightarrow R'L'$$ (Here is where, in the model category case, I would have a zig-zag, and would have to do some sort of work... I don't actually know how the argument would go off the top of my head.) This map respects the multiplication (the only proof I can think of uses that adjoint pairs are unique up to unique isomorphism, where "unique" in this setting means "parameterized by a trivial Kan complex". But it's possible this is more obvious than I think.) It is a natural isomorphism, and so we're good. I don't think we can get away with any other type of proof: you need some sort of "multiplication preserving zig-zag of weak equivalences of functors" argument to prove this at all, because if you provide some natural zig-zag of weak equivalences between $T$-algebras and $T'$-algebras then, in particular, you need to do it for free $T$-algebras and $T'$-algebras, and multiplication preserving weak-equivalences like this can only come in the form of some zig-zag of natural transformations of $T$ with $T'$ since that's where the algebra structure on free algebras comes from. 

So, relatively recently, Balmer introduced this notion of a spectrum for a tensor triangulated category and used it to prove a generalization of a classification theorem done in several areas of mathematics. Of course, the precursor to this was the work done by Devinatz, Hopkins, and Smith in classifying the thick subcategories of the stable hootopy category of (finite) spectra. They famously used this classification to prove the periodicity theorem, and I can see why it is helpful: the classification theorem reduces the periodicity theorem down to the (still nontrivial!) task of finding a single type $n$ complex with a periodic self-map. I'm sure similar uses have been found for the other classification theorems, but I am left to wonder, more generally: What kinds of problems are made simpler with a classification theorem? What questions does it answer? I'm looking for some general heuristics here. They should satisfy the following conditions: 

EDIT: I'm completely rewriting this in detail now that I think I've worked it out. Lots of possibilities for mistakes here, so stay alert! I claim that the generalization to include $(a)$ fails. My counterexample goes like this... Take $A$ to be any small, complete (that's small AND complete) category with no nonzero projectives. If the embedding into $R-mod$ given by Mitchell preserved arbitrary products, then it would be continuous since $A$ has equalizers and any limits can be built from products and equialisers (where equalisers are preserved by exactness). Now, for each $x \in R-mod$, consider the index set $I = \{f: x \rightarrow Va \vert a\in A\} = \bigcup_{a \in A} Hom(x, Va)\}$. (This is a set since hom-sets are small, and all of $A$ is a set.) Now, any $x \rightarrow Va$ can be realized as $x \rightarrow Va \rightarrow Va$ (with the identity), so we have verified the "solution set condition" of the adjoint functor theorem. If all is good, we may conclude that this embedding has a left adjoint $R-mod \rightarrow A$. Now, left adjoints of exact functors preserve projective objects (see Weibel). Now, if we choose some $b \in A$ that doesn't map to zero under the embedding $V$, and some free module $a \in R-mod$ that maps nontrivially to $b$, then by the bijection on hom-sets we get from the adjunction, we may conclude that $a$ maps to some nonzero element in $A$. But this is a contradiction, as the only projective elements of $A$ are zero. How does that look? 

Does anyone happen to know if a scan of Mazur's report exists, and, if so, where to find it? It appears in the references for Katz's "Higher congruences" and "Eisenstein measure" papers. 

Here is a proof of the much stronger result that, given any two nonsingular degree d hypersurfaces in $CP^{n+1}$, there exists a diffeomorphism $CP^{n+1} \rightarrow CP^{n+1}$ isotopic to the identity that restricts to a diffeomorphism of the two hypersurfaces. This is taken from the paper Topology of Nonsingular Complex Hypersurfaces by Kulkarni and Wood. 

They should apply to theorems already proven by classification theorems; examples and references would be lovely here! These heuristics should come with some sense of why one would think to use the classification theorem in this way. For example, I can see how the classification theorem makes the periodicity theorem manageable to prove, but why would one think to use it in the first place? This last one is more of a throw away or a bonus, but it's worth a shot: If there are any areas of mathematics, or open problems that you think are begging for a classification theorem type application then please share! It would be a useful test of the proposed heuristics if they are able to predict the solution of a problem that has not been solved... 

Let me go through a possible answer to my own question- just do some thinking out loud here. It seems to me that a classification of thick subcategories of a (tensor-) triangulated category is a good thing to have when you have some, relatively generic, thick subcategory, $S$, at hand and you want to prove something about it. Then you can say, "Well, $S$ can only be one of a couple subcategories and I have them all listed here. It can't be any of these because __, and if it's any of these other ones, then I can easily prove my claim. Here's an example that I thought of, but I'm not sure if this has been done. Suppose you have some functor $F: \mathcal{T} \rightarrow \mathcal{A}$ from a triangulated category to an abelian category. If, for some reason, it turned out that the kernel of this functor was a thick subcategory then we could apply the thick subcategory theorem to ask the question "When is $Fa = 0$?" In the case that the functor at hand satisfies $Fa = 0$ only when $a = 0$, then perhaps you could run through your classification and find a single object in each nonzero thick subcategory that maps to something nontrivial in $\mathcal{A}$. This would then prove that the kernel has to be whatever thing you had left. Actually, what's good about this use of the classification theorem is that it can be used very easily to get partial results. Maybe the thick subcategories of your triangulated category come in multiple flavours and it is easy to show that one flavour is not the kernel of the given functor, but you don't know for the other flavours. Maybe that's all you need to prove something useful regarding the functor at hand. I'm not sure how many functors from triangulated categories to abelian categories happen to satisfy the property that their kernel is a thick subcategory... On the other hand, any (triangulated) functor between triangulated categories does satisfy this property. So maybe you could apply this technique in the following way: You have a map between two objects $A \rightarrow B$ in some category (like noetherian schemes, or finite group schemes, or topological spectra). This should give rise to (hopefully triangulated) functors betweensome triangulated categories related to $A$ and $B$ (like derived category of perfect complexes on a scheme, or stable module category, etc.) I'm pretty sure that, at least in the usual cases, the original map will be trivial if and only if this induced map is. To find out if the induced map is trivial, we may pull the same trick as before and check to see if the thick subcategory corresponding to the kernel must be zero. That seems like a high-powered way to check if a map between to objects is trivial! But maybe it's useful? If anyone has seen anything like what I've described then please post a reference! I would love to know if this application has been done before (I'm sure it has, it was the first thing that came to mind...) 

I'll build that in a minute but first let's check that it proves the result. It suffices to check that $\mathrm{Sym}^n_{\mathbb{E}_k}(\overline{M})$ is at least $2d$-connective as soon as $n\ge 2$. But, by definition, this object is a colimit over a diagram whose objects all look like $\overline{M}^{\otimes_An}$. Since the $t$-structure is compatible with the tensor product (since $A$ is connective), these are $nd$-connective, and the subcategory of $nd$-connective objects in closed under colimits (since connectivity is checked on underlying spectra and it's true there). So the result is proved assuming we have the filtration. Now let's build it. First recall the construction of $\mathrm{Ind}_{\mathbb{E}_0}^{\mathbb{E}_k}M$. We're meant to consider all the ways to build tensor powers like $M^{\otimes_An}$ (one for each rectilinear embedding $\coprod_n I^k \hookrightarrow I$) and then glue things together via the various maps $M^{\otimes_An} \to M^{\otimes_Am}$ induced by the unit when $n\le m$. Explicitly, let $D$ denote the $\infty$-category whose objects are rectilinear embeddings $\coprod_n I^k \hookrightarrow I$ ($n$ arbitrary) and whose morphisms are embeddings $\coprod_n I^k \hookrightarrow \coprod_m I^k$ compatible with the structure map up to isotopy and which are injective on path components. (A rigorous definition is the fiber product in HA.3.1.3.1 in the case $\mathcal{C} = \mathsf{LMod}_A$, $\mathcal{A}^{\otimes} = \mathbb{E}_0^{\otimes}$, and $\mathcal{B}^{\otimes} = \mathbb{E}_k^{\otimes}$). Then $M$ extends to a diagram $M^{(-)}: D \to \mathsf{LMod}_A$ and the module underlying $\mathrm{Ind}_{\mathbb{E}_0}^{\mathbb{E}_k}M$ is the colimit of this diagram. Now, $D$ admits an evident filtration by $n$, $D_{\le n} \subset D_{\le n+1}$. Restricting and taking colimits defines a filtration $\{F_k\mathrm{Ind}_{\mathbb{E}_0}^{\mathbb{E}_k}M\}$ and I want to show it has the two properties above. The second should be straightforward from the definition, so I'll just do the first. Notice that there is a natural map $F_n/F_{n-1} \to \mathrm{Sym}^n_{\mathbb{E}_k}(\overline{M})$ coming from the natural maps $M^{\otimes_An} \to \overline{M}^{\otimes_An}$. We want this to be an equivalence. We'll prove this by induction on $n$. When $n=1$ the result is true by inspection: we're looking at the map $F_0=A \to F_1=M$ and taking the cofiber to get $\overline{M}$. I think one can prove the general case by induction on $n$, but I would have to come back and write the details if you want them.
