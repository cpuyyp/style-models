Let $S^2 = \{x\in \mathbf R^3\colon |x|=1\}$ be the unit sphere, $S^2_+ = S^2 \cap \{x_3 \ge 0\}$ be the upper hemisphere and $S^1 = S^2 \cap \{x_3 = 0\}$ be the unit circle. Let $u\colon S^2_+\to \mathbf R^3$ be a continuous function. Then it is easy to extend $u$ to the whole sphere $S^2$ preserving continuity: just patch with a cone constructed on the curve $u(S^1)$ i.e. identify the lower hemisphere with a unit disk and extend $u$ by $1$-homogenuity on this disk. My problem: if $u\colon S^2_+\to \mathbf R^3$ is continuous and injective, is it possible to extend it to a continuous and injective map defined on the whole sphere $S^2$? I think the answer should be yes. Notice that since $u$ is injective, continuous, and defined on a compact set it is an open map, and hence an homeomorphism with its image. I imagine that, from a topological point of view, there is a unique way to embed a 2-disk into $\mathbf R^3$ (cannot make a knot)... so my intuition says that there should even exist an extension of $u$ as an homeomorphism of the whole $\mathbf R^3$ into itself. Moreover, if the above is possible, I would like to have an explicit construction because I actually have a Lipschitz map and I would like to have a Lipschitz extension and also some control on the gradient of the extension, (as I have with the 1-homogeneous extension in the non injective case). 

Given a regular set $E\subset \mathbb R^2$ define $$ R(E) = \sup\{r\colon \exists x,\ B(x,r)\subseteq E\} $$ to be the radius of the largest circle contained in $E$ and let $|\partial E|$ be the length of the perimeter of $E$. Among all planar sets $E$ with fixed area, what is the one which minimizes the product $|\partial E| \cdot R(E)$? Do you have any keyword to look for? edit: Actually I'm looking for an estimate of the kind: $$ R(E) \ge c \frac{|E|}{|\partial E|} $$ for $E$ simply connected. And even a non optimal constant $c$ would be useful to me... I didn't realized that simply connectedness played a role. Sorry for that. 

The answer to the edited question is 'yes' if $R$ is a complete DVR in mixed characteristic with absolute ramification index $e< p-1$ (where $p$ is the residue characteristic). This is one of the main results of Raynaud's (p,...,p) paper. He shows in Corollaire 3.3.6 that the functor sending a finite flat group scheme of $p$-power order over R to its generic fiber is fully faithful (when $e< p-1$). 

I'm looking for a reference for the following standard result: Let $U$ be a unipotent algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ (of any characteristic); then any algebraic representation of $U$ has a fixed point. Statements of Engel's theorem for the analogous statement about Lie algebras seem to be ubiquitous. I can also find the statement that connected solvable groups always preserve a line in many places (for example, Borel, Theorem III.10.4). Combining this with the fact that unipotent groups have no non-trivial characters gives me the result I need. But it would be nice to have a place to which I could refer for the precise statement about unipotent groups. 

A student of Arthur, Bin Xu, has worked on the general problem of classifying automorphic representations for $GSp(2n)$. See his webpage here 

Your picture is right. The one thing I'll say (and this is somewhat tangential to your question) is that, for me, the analogue of $\pi_1(S^1)$ viewed as $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}\setminus\{0\})$ is not quite $\pi_1(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{F}_p)$, but rather the tame fundamental group of $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}_p^{nr}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_p^{nr}$ is the maximal unramified extension of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ (i.e. its universal cover: it's simply connected and therefore analogous to a disk around the origin in $\mathbb{C}$). In other words, $\pi_1(S^1)$ classifies $n$-fold covers of the circle (or of a punctured disk around the origin). Similarly, the tame fundamental group classifies $n$-fold covers of the 'punctured disk' $\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}_p^{nr}\setminus{p}$. The only hitch is that $n$ has to be prime to $p$ in this setting. This part of the Galois group is in the `geometric' direction (nothing's happening to the residue field of the point), while the part where the Frobenii live is in the arithmetic direction (all about extensions of $\mathbb{F}_p$). 

Edit: the question was unclear, so prompted by the comments and answers I've tried to clarify things. A colleague has asked me whether, or under what conditions, it is possible, given a sufficiently nice functor $F \colon \mathrm{Set} \to \mathrm{Set}$ with terminal coalgebra $\nu F$, to find another $F' \colon \mathrm{Set} \to \mathrm{Set}$ whose initial algebra $\mu F'$ is isomorphic to $\nu F$, with the two structure maps being inverses up to this isomorphism. In the case m'colleague is considering, F is the structure functor of an algebraic signature and $\nu F$ is the set of possibly infinite terms coinductively generated from it. Apparently the same set of terms can be generated inductively from a strictly larger signature, whose structure functor would then have an initial algebra, and he would like to know if there is a more abstract category-theoretic perspective on this situation. (Note that F and F' will in general not be the same.) It's an interesting question, and I'd like to help, but I'll be horribly busy for the next while and won't have time. Any ideas on where he could start looking? 

Remember that $\mathbf{2}$ is (classically) the subobject classifier in Set, so that there is a natural bijection $\mathrm{Sub}(X) \cong \hom(X,\mathbf{2})$ given by pulling back along $\mathrm{true} \colon \mathbf{1} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{2}$. So you can think of a subset of X as either an isomorphism class of monos into X or a function $X \to \mathbf{2}$. Mike Shulman's pages about 2-toposes say that there is no subobject classifier in Cat. I don't know of a reference, but you could drop a query box there asking. Such a thing would classify functors that are faithful and injective on objects (i.e. the monos in Cat). Edit: I misinterpreted Mike's remark at loc. cit., but see Michael Warren's answer. The closest thing I know of (see loc. cit.) is to classify discrete opfibrations with an equivalence between functors $A \to \mathrm{Set}$ and discrete opfibrations over A, given by pullback along the forgetful functor $\mathrm{Set}_\bullet \to \mathrm{Set}$ out of the category of pointed sets (see here). These don't look very similar, but in fact the Cat example is related to the comprehensive factorization system (initial, discrete opfibration) in Cat (see Street--Walters, The comprehensive factorization of a functor, Bull. AMS, (5)79, 1973), while the corresponding system in Set is (epi, mono). The latter also arises as the image factorization system, while in Cat, as far as I can tell, the two notions don't coincide. 

The answer is no, in general. The problem is to find an embedding so that the minuscule character corresponding to the Shimura datum for $S$ induces the minuscule character of $GSp_{2n}$ corresponding to a decomposition into Lagrangians. In the affirmative direction, for most classical, simply connected groups (and only for classical groups, i.e. of types $A$,$B$,$C$ and $D$), the answer is yes; some subtleties crop up for $Spin^*(2n)$ (this is the so called $D^{\mathbb{H}}$ case), for which only the quotient by an order 2 central sub-group admits a symplectic embedding (of Shimura data). This is all beautifully laid out in Deligne's article 'Varietes de Shimura...' here, following Satake here. See also Proposition 1.21 in Milne's article here 

Serge Lang started out as a graduate student of philosophy at Princeton, but he switched to math, because he had "finished it", it being philosophy. Here's the relevant part from his biography here "After returning to the United States, Lang went to Princeton University with the intention of studying for a doctorate in philosophy. After a year in the philosophy department, he changed to mathematics and Emil Artin became his thesis advisor." 

Suppose that we have a closed embedding $G_1\hookrightarrow G_2$ of reductive groups (say over $\mathbb{Q}$), and suppose that we have a maximal parabolic sub-group $P_2\subset G_2$, and a minimal parabolic $P_1\subset G_1$. Is it possible to have two different maximal parabolic sub-groups of $G_1$ contained in $P_2$ and containing $P_1$? Actually, is it even possible that there are two different maximal parabolics of $G_1$ contained in $P_2$? Even more optimistically, if there is a maximal parabolic sub-group of $G_1$ contained in $G_1\cap P_2$, does that make $G_1\cap P_2$ a parabolic sub-group and thus equal to the maximal parabolic it contains? EDIT: As Jim Humphreys points out below, there is one pathological case, where $G_1\cap P_2$ might be all of $G_1$. In which case, all parabolic sub-groups of $G_1$ will be contained in $P_2$! This is the case, for example, when $G_1$ is a Levi sub-group of $G_2$. But Angelo's answer below shows that, excluding this possibility, the answer to my third question is 'yes'. 

The bicategory of elements of a Cat-valued functor is defined in e.g. Street's Fibrations in bicategories; it's the same as the usual one, with 2-cells as described here. Its property of classifying lax transformations is also mentioned on that page (this page describes that property in the usual setting; it is not hard to generalize it). BakoviÄ‡'s preprint Fibrations of bicategories (PDF here) goes into lots more detail on the Grothendieck construction for bicategory-valued functors. I don't know if it characterizes the fibrations that arise from category-valued functors (a quick text search suggests not), but one plausible guess is that they should be the ones with locally discrete fibres. 

Have you tried nLab again? I'm not sure continuous functors are what you're looking for, incidentally. It seems more likely that a 'Scott-continuous functor' should be one that preserves filtered colimits. Replacing the preorders (and metric spaces) of domain theory with (enriched) categories is not a new idea. Have a look at Categories for fixpoint semantics (1978) by Daniel Lehmann, and Solving recursive domain equations with enriched categories (1994) by Kim Ritter Wagner. 

Kepler by John Banville is a sort of 'fictional biography'. Banville is a Booker prize winner, very highly regarded. His prose is some of the most beautiful, dense and lyrical I've ever read, and I'd recommend Kepler to anyone with an interest in mathematics and a taste for masterful writing. (Banville also wrote Doctor Copernicus, which I haven't read.) 

Here is a class of examples different to Tom's: if your underlying monoidal category C is closed, then a strong monad on C is the same as a C-enriched monad, i.e. one that respects the enrichment of C given by its internal hom (this is why every monad on Set is strong, as Andrej points out). So one example would be the monad on Cat (considered as a Set-category) whose algebras are cartesian closed categories -- it is known that this is not a Cat-monad (although it does extend to Cat as a groupoid-enriched category). I would imagine that the same is true for the monad for monoidal closed categories, or in general for categories with any one sort of mixed-variance structure. 

Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a number field, and let $MT(A)$ be its Mumford-Tate group. It is a conjecture of Morita that if $MT(A)$ is anisotropic-mod-center (that is, it has no $\mathbb{Q}$-rational unipotent elements), then $A$ has potentially good reduction. The basic example is when $MT(A)$ is a torus: in this case, this conjecture is one of the first results one proves in the theory of complex multiplication of abelian varieties. One way that Morita's conjecture is formulated is as follows: The condition on $MT(A)$ ensures that the Shimura variety attached to it is compact, and the conjecture says that the Shimura variety in fact has proper reduction at any finite prime; a transcendental condition has been transported to the world of arithmetic. Strictly speaking, this is stronger than the formulation given above, since we are now talking about the reduction of a whole host of abelian varieties (ones that appear in the family over the Shimura variety) rather than just $A$. This leads me to: Question: Is anything known about the converse to the original formulation? Suppose that $A$ has potentially good reduction everywhere; then is $MT(A)$ anisotropic-mod-center? 

To expand on my comment to the question, we have the following algebraic construction (I think originally due to Robert Brown, 'A characterization of spin representations'): Let $V$ be a quadratic space over a field $k$ of characteristic $\neq 2$. Attached to this is the Clifford algebra $C=C(V)$: it is equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$-grading $C=C^+\oplus C^-$ and an embedding $V\hookrightarrow C^-$. The general Spin group $GSpin(V)$ consists of units in $C^+$ that preserve $V$ under conjugation. The group $Spin(V)$ is the sub-group of elements that have trivial spinor norm. So, to describe $Spin(V)$ as an automorphism group, it suffices to do so for $GSpin(V)$. Let $H$ be the graded vector space $C$ viewed as a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via left multiplication: it is also a right $C$-module via right multiplication. Then $GSpin(V)$ clearly lies within the group $U(H)$ of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$. Set $E=End(H)$: this is a representation of $GSpin(V)$ via conjugation. Define a bilinear form $\{,\}:E\times E\to k$ by $$\{f,g\}=\frac{1}{2^{dim(V)}}trace(fg).$$ Now choose a basis $\{v_i\}$ for $V$, and let $A=(v_i\cdot v_j)_{i,j}$ be the inner product matrix attached to this basis. Set $(b_{i,j})=B=A^{-1}$. Define an endomorphism $\pi:E\to E$ by the formula: $$\pi(f)(h)=\sum_{i,j}b_{i,j}\{v_i,f\}v_jh.$$ Clearly, the image of $\pi$ is $V\subset E$, where $V$ acts on $H$ via left multiplication. Let $G'\subset U(H)$ be the stabilizer of the endomorphism $\pi$. Then $G'$ preserves $V$ via conjugation, and is therefore contained in $GSpin(V)$. On the other hand, it is not hard to see that $GSpin(V)$ stabilizes $\pi$. So we see that $GSpin(V)$ can be described as the group of $C$-equivariant, grading preserving automorphisms of $H$ that also stabilize $\pi$.
