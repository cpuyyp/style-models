A chain shouldn't even come close to fitting between the chain rings if all the parts are selected to work together. Either the bike was built using badly matched components or something was wrong (bent) to start with. I suspect the latter as that's a chainset for 10 speed chains - unless that was specified but a different model was fitted in error. It's hard to see how you could bend only an inner chainring inwards accidentally. 

Do you need a bike hanging bracket, or even a wall mounted work stand? The front triangle as in the church of cycling lamp image suggests how, and old tubes could be used to give it some grip and prevent it damaging a bike hung from it. Or how about a single wheel bike trailer? 

We can do some rough estimates. Let's assume that bikes are made exclusively of metal, and that only the mass of the bike counts (no energy consumed in welding etc.). Looking up the carbon footprints of aluminium and steel we have: 

Reading your "on a child carrier" as meaning a seat mounted to the bike, you have a few options: Front seats. I've only mentioned these in case you don't know about them and to get them out of the way. 

(obviously these 3 are pretty much mutually exclusive anyway) Also it makes shouldering the bike harder -- your shoulder is further forward meaning the bike isn't as well balanced. 

There are some Peugeot catalogues (mostly in English, some French) from around that era at the Veteran cycle club online library (note they're not in order, but the '76, '78 and '79 catalogues are there). Other sites include Cycles Rétro-Peugeot (various languages but I didn't see any English, decent resolution and coverage) and BikeBoomPeugeot (French, low resolution). Your date range seems very reasonable; it's not quite right for a '76--'78 Amateur Champion (decals on forks and downtube don't match) but there's a lot that's similar. You'll have to be careful of non-original components - obviously the bar tape is modern and it's bound to have got through a few drivetrain components in that time. 

I'm likely to have to commute to somewhere that's less than ideal for security. The whole thing is less than ideal but it's only for a couple of weeks. Using using the beater bike I already have isn't an option: it's 23 km under time pressure, and sometimes I'll have to use the hybrid with child seat (and try to get there in 55 minutes). I'd rather use the tourer if I don't need the child seat. In either case I'll take two locks (probably one D-lock and one cable lock, possibly 2 D-locks). There are some fairly solid iron railings to lock up to, and both bikes are already security marked and registered. So as an added detterent I'd like to make the bikes look as undesirable as possible -- how can this be done in a reversible way? While Reduce Resale Value to Avoid Theft? (Uglify) is closely related, the answers there concentrate on permanent approaches, and I'm specifically after something more temporary. 

First you need to decide what's limiting your braking. If it's the tyres on the road skidding -- or you're having to back off the brakes to avoid that -- then changing your tyres might help. But tread might not be what you need on a smooth surface. If you can apply the brakes quite hard without skidding, and still slow down less than you'd like, look at the pads. I run dual compound kool stop pads in all conditions and I'm happy with them. Double check the rim material before shopping for pads. It's also possible that you're relying too much on the back brake. Most of the stopping power comes from the front, though you do need to take care in the wet as when a front wheel skids it's much worse than when the back does so. It's also much less likely. Another thought: adjustment. On all rim breaks you have to squeeze the lever harder for wet rims. With good pads/rims the difference is minimal. With bad pads it's significant. With a good mechanism the harder squeeze won't result in much more movement of the lever. With poor components or even sloppy cable routing the travel can increase. It's then possible for your levers to bottom out, especially if you've got a big gap between the rim and the brake at rest. That's what the barrel adjuster is for, though the wheel needs to be in good shape to if you want to minimise the gap. This is harder to get right if you've got small hands and have adjusted the lever rest position. 

Aside from it being illegal, when the roads are busy is the last time you want to be going up and down badly dropped curbs and crossing side roads (not always where you would like to from the point of view of visibility). When the roads are that busy, riding wide (so cars can't squeeze past) helps a lot. Frequent shoulder checks, even if you have a mirror, are a good idea. Then when there's a big gap in the oncoming traffic you can tuck in, sit up straighter and slow down - subject to potholes of course, they're another reason to not ride too close to the curb if there are too many cars around for you to pull out round the bad bits. 

Bike chains have to have some other method to take up the error (like horizontal dropouts or tensioners even on a single speed). They'd still need this if the maximum error was halved, so you wouldn't really gain anything. Chains would need thicker walls as the walls would no longer be in pure tension (the force would tend to straighten them). This would make the chain heavier and wider, neither of which is desirable. It would also be more expensive as parts would have to be stamped then bent rather than just stamped. 

What's the temperature now? If it's been above freezing for a while, lots of GT85 into any opening is a good start, then jiggle the key. If it doesn't feel like it goes in all the way (and is symmetrical) then try rotating 180° before reinserting. Leaving the oil to penetrate also helps. For short-term lubrication, you just want something light and mobile; once you fix it, I suggest you oil it with whatever you use for your chain. If it's still below freezing, there is such a thing as lock deicer. It's isopropyl alcohol. The problem can be getting it to the right place. This is an effective degreaser, so re-oiling the lock afterwards is a good idea1. It can be hard to deliver enough heat unless you can get power there: a hairdryer (or heat gun on low) can be good, but naked flames are generally a bad idea (especially if you've just doused it in oil/isopropanol). Heating the key or a similar piece of metal can help, but only if the keyhole is frozen, not if the mechanism is frozen further inside. Where (my) old question may come in is that a good smack with something solid might help anyway try hitting one end , then jiggling the key, the other end, each side... 

One thing the plastic is designed to do (and for which it doesn't need to be thick) is to have low friction with the road. So if you come off your head slides rather than snagging. The friction that the plastic stops would injure your neck, and also lead to very fast abrasion of the foam,perhaps just in time for it to be destroyed before you hit something solid. Even a fairly thin layer backed by foam also spreads the impact of a point over a larger area. Flexible plastic does a very good job of holding the helmet together, so that it absorbs more energy if it splits and still has some use after the first hit (one crash can easily cause multiple head impacts) 

Now the important factors are dealt with, this is the conclusion I reached and recommend, with my reasoning. If you don't know whether the main use is going to be on-road, off-road, commuting or shopping then a hybrid or a hardtail mountain bike (the cheaper sort) won't be too far wrong. Personally I'd take the hybrid because it's more likely to be able to carry stuff which you might well want. I've done over 20 000 miles on my hybrid and still use it for commuting. I only upgraded (to a tourer, still versatile) because I wanted to (after about 50 miles it starts to feel like hard work), and might buy a mountain bike (again because I want to ride rougher stuff; with the right tyres the hybrid and the tourer handle dirt tracks quite well). 

The skewer isn't an axle so nothing rotates and it and there's no need for grease. It's more likely that the wheels aren't completely straight in the dropouts causing the brakes or tyres to rub. I tend to tighten the skewers with the bike's weight on the wheels, rather than on a work stand. But you should also check the sequence of components again as well. Finally the tab washer supplied with pinhead skewers these days may be the issue. The single tab goes in the dropout, after the skewer. It's just possible that even installed correctly this washer doesn't sit in the right place and misaligns the wheel. One of my bikes had pinhead skewers from new 7 years ago without these washers, with no problems; I've just added them (when fitting matching skewers to my new bike). 

Unlike with quick release wheels, the fastener for pedals bears all the load, so a quick release would have to be very strong. There's also very little room to play with and the forces are large. Combined with no incentive to sell something, this means manufacturers would have a hard time making money from a QR pedal product. Pedals are quicker to change than (back) wheels; that 5 minutes is achievable with a cheap spanner and very little practice. If you go down that route you should mark the left and right very clearly, and keep a pot of grease handy. I swap flat pedals on for family holidays and it really is a quick job. 

Returning briefly to the original claim, when I've seen this claimed it tends to use low mileage figures, and neglect the fact that the metals in cars tend to be recycled (for Al this makes a big difference). It would make a good question at skeptics.se if you could source the claim more thoroughly. 

My bottle holder under the frame (the third) is also prone to dropping its contents. That's easily fixed with an elastic strap round the bottle and down tube (I use an old reflective ankle strap or bungee cord. I doubt many people will be drinking from a bottle mounted there while riding anyway, so the extra difficulty of getting it out doesn't really matter. The cheap aluminium cages can be bent tighter, but with plastic cages it's easier to pad them out using an old inner tube, cable ties, and/or duct tape. You can buy clamps to put a bottle on the handlebars. Two-bottle belts are available -- I have an old one that I sometimes use if I ride then run. Mine takes 800ml bottles happily, but anything bigger would be awkward. 

Proper bikes do exist in kids sizes, in essentially all types. 24" wheels are now common, which makes things easier. Some examples: 

I went for somehting like this random ebay hit which didn't slide around on my foot even when wet, and was as good as trainers for gripping the pedals. 

That curve matches the end of the liner, and with enough air in the tube I could feel it leaking. The liner doesn't feel like it has a rough edge (we'll find out because I left the liner in with a new tube), and it's been running fine for over a year. This would appear to defeat the point of liners, so am I missing something? Does too high pressure cause this? Too low? 

Buy a cheap and ugly bike to start with, but one that fits you. Fix up the gears/tyres/brakes to good enough. If it gets stolen you haven't lost much, but hopefully it won't. I'm in the process of doing something similar (including overnight storage outside). Some suggestions: 

A bike I sometimes borrow has one of these locks, and I can't say it's ever been a problem. You've given the answer in your question: Do not close the wheel lock between a spoke and the valve. If you're prone to forgetting this, what you need is a way to make the valve more obvious. I've had automatically illuminated valve caps before. That would do the trick, even in darkness, but the cheap ones I've used haven't been very waterproof. Alternatively putting a spoke-mounted reflector in that range of spokes might help. If even those don't stop you, something like tape between the spokes either side of the valve should prevent you locking up on the bit of the wheel, but might get in the way of the valve and will almost certainly end up making a mess. 

These all seem to be within a reasonable margin of error (bikehike was 12% less than my GPS, the biggest difference). Note that this route wasn't hilly, and didn't run in any steep-sided valleys, so lateral GPS errors will only have had a small effect. I counted 5m contour lines on the 1:25000 OS map, using a magnifying glass. I'm surprised that at the first attempt I got so close to my measured data. In some places the road almost follows the contours and in other places the contours are obscured by other features. Unfortunately Google doesn't understand UK rights of way very well, and can only get a small fraction of the off-road sections, so my comparison can't be extended to include that. Test 2: 67.5km of road with around 470m of climb I applied the same test to a longer road ride (but not one I plan to publish). Much of the ride is quite flat, with a couple of decent climbs. I do this ride every few weeks so have some average data. We have: 

The 2-20 years growth charts here includes predictions of adult height. The boys chart shows that growth between 18 and 20 is less than 1cm (obviously this is averaged over a arge population, and delayed puberty would have a bigger effect, but that would be a different issue). There are two ways given to predict final adult height. One is percentile based (i.e. based on which line you;re on now) and the other is based on parental height (via the percentile you're likely to end up on). Unless there's a big mismatch between the two, you don't need to worry about it. Unless you're very unlucky or your growth has been delayed for some reason you should be within minor adjustments of your current height for the foreseeable future. Just don't get a bike that's on the small side.
