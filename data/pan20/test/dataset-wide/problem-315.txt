This is an unqualified YES. Amateurs spot new asteroids and comets all the time; it is just a matter of equipment that is affordable to many in the upper middle class, like Joe. Some people buy \$200,000 boats for their hobby, others could spend that on astronomy instead. I have spent 40 years either earning in Joe's range or above it but working daily with people that earn in that range; and I know from personal contact it is plausible for some to spend lavishly on their hobbies. Perhaps \$70,000 a year would be an outlier, but not implausible. Make Joe a little older (warranting the higher remote salary) and he could easily have half a million dollars worth of equipment. He is technically minded, he can understand and compute the trajectories, speeds, etc. As a computer developer he can probably program accurate simulations to find places to look, or discover anomalies. Joe can be, effectively, the same as a professional astronomer with professional equipment matching the typical university observatory setup. 

By the law of COE, what you need is that somehow you have invested an enormous amount of energy into Initial Mana, but the regular Mana is basically the same thing without an enormous amount of energy. My first thought is to relate it, analogously, to carbon. With an enormous amount of energy (both heat and pressure) I can compress carbon into diamond, a perfect lattice, and that energy could be considered 'stored' in the bonds formed between atoms of carbon in the lattice. It takes a great deal of energy to liberate a carbon atom from its diamond lattice: That is why diamond is one of the hardest things on earth, the hardest scratch on anything else breaks those weaker bonds, not the bond in the diamond. On the other hand, graphite is mostly carbon. Without the invested energy, it is one of the softest things on earth, it is scratched by almost anything: That is why it makes a good pencil lead, the slightest pressure and the carbon breaks off by the billions. Say every action requires an equal and opposite reaction: If you consider the force required to accomplish some piece of magic to require balancing specifically by the liberation of atoms of Mana, then the diamond form will last far longer than the graphite form, just because so much more energy is required to liberate an atom of diamond than is required to liberate an atom of graphite. I am not saying Mana is carbon: It is its own magical element. I am just saying your wizards can explain it to students, saying the carbon analogy is apt. Mana has two wildly different forms of the same element. You can go further and say the crystallized form seems only possible if it is embedded within a life force as the catalyst for crystallization, and without a life force the loosely bound graphite form seems to be all that can form. 

I upvote some of the above. One answer not mentioned: ensuring there is nothing wrong with the star. I presume a galaxy spanning civilization knows a great deal more about stars and how they work than we humans know now; so perhaps internal probes would help them decide on th exact makeup and "health" of the star before they begin colonizing the system or using it for some purpose. They want to know the precise age, how much fuel remains, internal circulation patterns, any unusual chemical makeup, and ensure there are no microscopic black holes lurking in it. Or whatever else their super-advanced knowledge about stars might demand. In the system itself they might want to install some kind of sensory apparatus or "Claim Stake" to report on future developments; or register the territory as claimed so others know they are planning to begin development here in the next million years. It is a galactic civilization after all, surely there must be rules and regulations governing the use and appropriation of natural resources like star systems. 

By logic, I'd say the minimum amount is 1, or perhaps less (meaning the number of supporters could be less than the number of fighters). A "fighter", even male, needs nothing that a wife and children do not need. Food to eat and some kind of shelter. Any other ratio is in necessity of paying the fighters and letting them support a family. In many early human cultures this was not even considered -- men were hunters, and also soldiers, and women and children were generally taking care of grazing animals (usually goats, sometimes cattle, ox, or other bovines); they got their sustenance from milk and other animal products. I know the OP timeframe is circa 1900, not 1900 BC, but I bring this up to prove a point: Any ratio of civilians to fighters greater than 1 or 2 is due to an economic necessity to pay the fighters. That makes the ratio dependent upon the efficiency and productivity of the society itself. Even in 1900, this varied greatly from nation to nation, so the answer depends largely upon the average wealth of the nation,and what people can afford to part with. A subsistence level of society needs a very large ratio if fighters are to be paid a living wage; because people cannot afford very much. A rich society in which people can afford high taxes can have a very low ratio. (In a way, primitive tribes had an extremely high "tax" rate: Soldiers, hunters, wives and children all devoted their entire "working" life to their tribe, without compensation, making it a 100% tax rate!) 

I'd go the opposite way. The child is as immortal as her parents, but mentally unformed. She will grow up in the community and live in it beside her parents, grandparents, and everybody else forever. An immortal race would not think about generations the same as us; if my child in 25 years is going to be my neighbor for 10,000 years, like I have been neighbors with my own parents, grandparents, and practically every ancestor for 10,000 years, I will devote 100% of the next 25 years ensuring she becomes an upstanding citizen that pulls her weight and socializes perfectly. Now is the time to form that mind while it is malleable, to ensure she is not spoiled, entitled, egotistical or anything else. Their perspective has to be geared to the long term. They will not see offspring the same way, because in their world, 99.9999999% of their life they and their parents are peers. This is seldom true for humans; our parents are generally 20 years ahead of us and that is always a significant amount in a 75 year life. Not so for immortals; their children will "catch up" to them and perhaps even surpass them in wisdom, life experience, education, wealth, responsibility and more. What we see as a persistent gap between us and our parents will fade away to nothing: Bob is 5025 and his son is 5000, is his son still supposed to defer to him? I don't think so. I don't think spoiled children will be a problem, elven children need to be raised with social skills that will last them forever. 

You mention "oceans", certainly we have huge aquifers in the world (Ogallala in the US is a big one; 174,000 square miles, bigger than the Caspian Sea (at 143,000 sq mi). Here are other aquifers). A world heavily dotted with a network of such aquifers could have no oceans; but I imagine there would still be a water cycle above ground: Plants could access the water, but evaporate it by normal biology; there would still be some cloud cover and rains due to concentrations caused by planet rotation winds: Just the rain doesn't accumulate, it percolates back down into the aquifers. I don't think you can have surface plants without them producing water vapor, by drying out (especially upon death) or burning: water is not destroyed by burning, it just becomes steam and escapes (and must go somewhere). If water vapor is produced, an above ground water cycle would exist. If the plants only grow under ground, the evaporation can be absorbed by the earth or rock ceiling. If they grow under water there is no evaporation, but there could be a cycle of exchange between plant fluids and the water. added: Animals on such a planet would evolve to get their water from the food they eat; ultimately traceable back to the water the plants are bringing up from the aquifers. IRL we do have animals that only get water from their food, I can't recall which ones off-hand, but it isn't a stretch for evolution. In any case, having gotten their water, they would still eliminate it, by sweat, saliva / panting, tears, urination and defecation. Those in turn would evaporate and dry, contributing vapor to the water cycle, which would collect and become rain. Some animals would evolve (like we have in the deserts, IRL) to get all their water during the rains, and store it within their bodies to be used slowly, in-between the rains. 

I doubt that. I am very highly educated (five college degrees, all in STEM fields, including two Masters and a PhD) with a lifetime 4.0 GPA. I will likely never be a politician! Politicians are popular people, and good with people, and I am not. I have little in common with the vast majority of citizens: I am an atheist, I do not drink or smoke or use any mind altering drugs, ever. I have been drunk precisely once, 43 years ago. I won't even take a baby aspirin: I tried it for health reasons, but it interferes with my concentration and focus for hours. I don't follow any sports. I don't read anything but non-fiction (although in video form I watch a great deal of scifi and fantasy). I almost never play any video games or computer games. I am boring to the vast majority of voters. My role is to solve problems that 99.999% of people cannot solve; I will do my best to keep your aircraft from falling out of the sky, keep your buildings and bridges from falling down, keep your energy green, increase the yield of your crops, do the math to thwart the diseases that plague you, find the root causes of your misery and despair and try my best to do something about it. If you want to have a beer with me, or talk soccer or football, I am not interested; it is not part of my world. I truly could not possibly care any less who won, who lost, or who got voted off the island. I hasten to add I am not a robot; I am in love with my wife, I have empathy for the pain and suffering of others, I want a just world without criminals and frauds and takers. I am just not ever going to get the votes, and I am not sociopathic enough to fake it or backstab my way to the top. Why citizens reward others that are clearly lying and misrepresenting the truth is down to their inability to understand the truth, but that is a problem I cannot solve, and I've never thought of a work around I could use in order to get elected. I know literally hundreds of actual scientific experts; with a tiny percent of exceptions, being an expert in some intellectual field is a recipe for looking like an alien to most voters, people that cannot manage middle school arithmetic (logarithms and exponentiation). Further, the well-reasoned position is simply not what most people want to hear; it does not comport with their religion or prejudices or bigotries or greed.
