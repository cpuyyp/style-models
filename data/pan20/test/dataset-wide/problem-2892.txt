You seem to be describing, possibly, simple emergence or emergentism? Your "meta property" is just an emergent property, from what you call "artifacts". The key characteristic seems to be just what you describe: once the phenomenon has emerged, it cannot be reduced back to what it came from. It "has a life of its own" now. $URL$ $URL$ 

After reading the section from which those quotes come (thanks @CooLeeo for the link in your answer!), I think I have a better idea of what Heidegger means. First, the "casting-toward of being" means something like "just existing without thinking". I am reminded of the humorous poster of an ape or orangutan with the caption "Sometimes I sits and thinks. And sometimes I just sits." The key to the "casting-away of being" is Heidegger's opening sentences of the section about how as soon as you start thinking or talking about what "being is", you are necessarily "casting away" (separating yourself) from being itself. I.e. you're no longer "just sitting" without thinking. As to both "being ... essential", the context suggests that by "essential" Heidegger merely means "part of the essence of our (human) universe", not "required" or "necessary" as the term means in English. (I suspect a translation issue.) Or in other words, "that's just the way it is". Likewise, by the second rhetorical question, Heidegger seems to just be tacking on the additional "why worry about it?", or even "regular people aren't distressed by the situation, why should philosophers be?", or "this is our (humans') natural state, so deal" :-). 

I would say that "claiming misrepresentation" is a valid "rhetorical device" if supported (i.e. by pointing out where the opposite party has paraphrased wrongly (or outright falsely quoted)). The problem lies in "but Alice offers no additional clarification", which puts your hypothetical in the realm of "stonewalling" I think: $URL$ 

All individuals have the same utility system. $U: -1 <= U <= 1$. The sum of the utility of an event and its negation is $0$. At any given time, the sum total of an individual's potential utility space is $0$. If two events are independent then the utility of both events occurring is the sum of their individual utilities. 

Is the Halting Oracle inconsistent? Basically, the axiom of consistency says that paradoxes can never emerge in any universe. The laws governing all universes are such that no paradox can occur. Axiom of Inclusivity (Axiom 2 of the Multiverse Axioms): 

For every event that can occur, there’s a corresponding event that represents that event not occurring called its negation; every event has a negation. If an individual gains positive utility from an event happening, then they must gain equivalent negative utility from the event not happening. The utility they derive from an event and its negation must sum to $0$. Such is only logical. The positive utility you gain from an event happening, is proportional to the negative utility g This follows from the method of deriving “2” explained above. This follows from the method of deriving “2” explained above. This follows from “2” and “3”. This follows from “3”. This follows from “3”. This follows from “3”. This is via intuition. Two events $A$ and $B$ are independent if the utility of $A$ does not depend on the occurrence of $B$ nor does $B$ in any way affect the utility of $A$ and vice versa. If such is true, then to calculate the utility of $A$ and $B$, we need only sum the individual utilities of $A$ and $B$.   It can be seen that my system can be reduced to postulates “1”, “2”, “3”, “6” and “10”. The ten point system is for the sake of clarity which always supersedes brevity and eloquence.   If any desire the concise version: 

The reason I ask is because of the ambiguity of some statements when the conditionals of a condition are not referenced by tense i.e time. For example, in the Cognito Ergo Sum 'I think therefore I am', it could be read as saying that thinking causing existence, which is obviously not the case. Let my elucidate the problem, as you'll be well aware, this is an instance of Modus Ponens, which can broken down as such: 

This is usually thought of as p being a sufficient cause, which necessitates an effect, in the case of the Cogito Ergo Sum, this would mean thinking causes existence. However, it could also mean that p is sufficient evidence of a necessary cause, in the case of the Cogito Ergo Sum, this would mean that thinking is sufficient evidence for the necessity of one's existence, which of course is Descartes intent in his assertion. So it's not that a given cause (thinking) is sufficient for the necessary outcome for one's existence (the effect), but that thinking (the outcome) is a sufficient effect which can be adduced to a necessary cause – existence. It's not just grand assertions like the Cogito Ergo Sum, however, that is prone to such ambiguity. Afterall, one may consider that given such a fundamental assertion, it may not be the best example. Consider then the assertion: 'if there is rain, then there are clouds'. Certainly one has never seen the pour of rain from a cloudless sky, so we can say this is true with great confidence. However, if a blind man was told that 'if it is raining, then there are clouds' (and was never taught the cause-effect relationship of clouds and rain) he would be as justified to presume (though wrong) in saying that rain causes clouds.
