Abs are muscles like any other muscle in your body. What's different is the typical exercise regimen. Most people train abs with crunches, sit-ups, etc., which are tantamount to a very high-rep exercise with low weight. Compare with a bench press where you're doing at most sets of 10-12. This high-rep exercise is probably not too effective for much more than perhaps endurance for very light-weight work. Certainly because of the light weight, it's only hitting the slow-twitch muscles which recover quickly so you could do this sort of exercise every day. If you want to build muscle strength and mass I think you'll need to involve heavier weight, which means fewer reps to failure, which means involving your various fast-twitch fibers, which means more rest between workouts as the fast-twitch fibers (three kinds, actually) take longer to recover than the slow-twitch. All this said, having "sculpted" abs is primarily about shedding body fat rather than doing exercises to shape and grow your abdominals. 

Specifically taking NSAIDS (e.g. Advil/Ibuprofen) may be a very good idea. It's not just for the pain, but also to reduce inflammation, which can linger and cause that pain. Within the last year or two, I've had (unrelated) injuries to both my knee and my foot. Both caused enough pain to prevent any sort of related exercise and had me limping. Both lingered (the knee lingered for well over a month before I got it checked out). In both cases, when I finally saw a doctor they prescribed a NSAID (double-dose ibuprofen in one case, naproxen in the other) and that fixed the problem fast. Because these injuries had lingered, I'm sure it was the anti-inflammatory properties of the drugs, rather than the painkilling aspects that did the trick. In addition, assuming an inflammation-based problem, icing it can help. I iced both injuries, and it seemed to help a little on a temporary basis, but the NSAID was the real magic trick for me in both cases 

Also, a tan never hurts. Notice how in many before & after pictures for diet products, the "after" picture has a noticeably darker shade... Disclaimer: this is not particularly healthy, but it should help to make you look more cut for special occasions. More info: 

I recently watched Bigger Stronger Faster, a documentary on steroid use, and was struck by their claim that commonly accepted health risks are not proven and seem to mostly be accepted because of intense government marketing (a situation not dissimilar to the misleading nutritional recommendations published by the USDA and others). In particular, they claimed that "roid rage" is a myth (anyone who was going to go into a rage had that in their personality anyway) and that links to e.g. cancer are speculative and very little research has been done to this effect. In order to try to track this down, I went to the relevant wikipedia page and found the following paragraph on health risks: 

Vertical Pulls (progress when you can do 3 sets of 40) Horizontal Pulls (3 sets of 30) Jackknife Pulls (3/30) Half Pullups (2/15) Full Pullups (2/10) Close Pullups (2/10) Uneven Pullups (2/9) 1/2 One-Arm Pullups (2/8) Assisted One-Arm Pullups (2/7) One-Arm Pullups 

I've been doing a workout inspired by Body By Science for the last 5 weeks. I can't do the whole book justice in a quick post, but in a nutshell it recommends doing a single set of 3-5 exercises slowly, with high intensity, and to failure once per week. The purpose of the exercise is to exhaust all four types of muscle fibers simultaneously and drain their glucogen reservoirs. Supposedly this sets off different cascading effects within the body for strength gain, general endurance (including "cardio") and fat loss. The workouts are spaced a week apart because supposedly it takes that time to fully recover and more frequent workouts are counterproductive. The explanations in the book are referenced and if there's any dubious science, I missed it. I've found that it seems to have maintained my strength, weight, body fat %, etc. with only the short weekly workout, but I am stagnant. I'm not getting any stronger (as measured by time-under-load) or any lighter (as measured by drop in scale weight or body fat %). I have not changed any other aspect of my lifestyle; sleep, diet, supplements, stress level have all been constant. I would like some help diagnosing what the problem is: 

Aside from the standard low-carb movement, the primary basis for this position is the lectins that are found in grains. Grain lectins are thought to be mildly toxic. Certain carbohydrates seem to protect the body from some of these lectins (e.g. glucosamine protects against wheat lectins), but are not always 100% effective. For more, see this article about lectins, which contains an in-depth explanation and references to source research papers. 

Certainly you're at the point where you have to focus on technique, and doing so will not only help you push past plateaus but also avoid injury. The following technique list is taken from Power to the People Professional, and all adds up to an explosive push. Notice the focus on deriving power through your feet and directing that through your body! The bench press is just as much a full-body exercise as the deadlift or squat. 

After performing squats I often feel elbow soreness (or perhaps extreme fatigue). I'd like to see if anyone can offer form corrections that might help reduce the strain, or if my form looks OK, then perhaps some supplemental exercise recommendations to help strengthen the elbows. I use a false grip, and I feel like I am pushing the bar almost straight forward into my shoulders in order to keep it stable. 

Here's one simple visualization technique that engages and stabilizes your core: Imagine a straight line running through your body connecting anus to belly-button. Now, without sucking in, try to make that line as short as possible. 

I think I'm following the spirit of the book's recommendations, but for full disclosure here are the areas I can think of in which I deviate (the book didn't seem to indicate that these would be significant problems): 

Once you have your grip and lower back stronger, then you'll develop new weak points (quad strength, for example) and you can once again work on increasing that and increasing weight without equipment crutches. 

I wouldn't worry about supplements just yet, if you're only getting back into exercising now. They are intended to finesse results. The core of your plan should be healthy diet and exercise; you certainly don't need supplements to lose weight or to be healthy in general. If you are going to pick between a focus on protein and carbohydrates I think that you're going to be better off with the protein. Protein is used to build up muscle and also helps suppress your appetite. Carbohydrates are extra energy, which you really don't need; certainly you'll pick some up in your diet (I'm not necessarily advocating for or against a very low-carb diet like Atkins - although it will work). 

As other answers have mentioned, these ratios are just rough averages for most people who are well and equally trained on all movements. Moving beyond the EXRX standards mentioned (which focus on powerlifting lifts), here are some more ratios for Olympic lifts taken from Greg Everett's Olympic Weightlifting. 

One method seems to be urine test strips. Although the strips are inexpensive and completely non-invasive, there are a couple drawbacks: 

I'm always a believer in training a skill by practicing that skill, or as close to it as you can come, rather than something different that seems complimentary. Certainly the transition from pull-up to dip is the hardest part of a muscle-up, and I believe that it is at least as much technique as it is strength: when I was learning muscle-ups I found that I was able to get them rather suddenly when something "clicked" about making that transition, rather than gradually coming closer and closer as I got stronger. So, I'd suggest doing them as you can - quickly, for now - and just trying to focus on gradually slowing down. You can still train the negative slowly. 

According to Body By Science, you can develop strength and cellular aerobic exercise with a 15-20 minute workout every 7-10 days. In fact, this book argues that more frequent exercise may even be counterproductive. Mind you, these brief infrequent workouts are quite intense and are design to simultaneously exhaust all four muscle fibers and drain their glycogen reserves. 

In a schedule like this, you can alternate 1RM or 2RM on the last day. A reccommendion in practical programming was to alternate 1 and 2 every other week. 

Just see how you feel on Friday. If you ended up doing some work on Thursday and feel tired, then wait until Saturday. If you're feeling great, then just go for it. You can also start the workout on Friday and judge by your warmups & first work set. If they go off without a hitch, continue the workout. If you're dragging through them & they are harder then they should be, then just stop and wait a day. Generally speaking, when in doubt err on the side of an extra day of rest. Just don't use a little tiredness as an excuse to regularly postpone workouts. 

Warm up. Anything "extreme" you are going to do, try it lightly first and pay attention to your body. Little twinges and pulls during a warmup are warning signs. For example, before doing heavy lifts I always do one set at 50-60% of my maximum weight just to test my joints and see if I notice anything that might cause an injury if I were pushing myself. For "high explosive" "combat sports" you might try doing kicks, jumps, falls, etc. lightly before going all-out, again focusing most of your attention on whether everything in your body feels "right". 

Yes, the bar should be roughly above your eyes. By foot side, he means you should be looking just slightly towards your feet, rather than straight up at the bar. 

Most of the hearsay about limiting workout length is based on studies that were done on hard cardio workouts. Comparing to this type of strength training is apples and oranges, as your intensity is much higher and you rest between sets. Also keep in mind that the difference between 45 minutes and 60 minutes isn't that great - we're not talking about several hours here! You're right that high-level strength athletes very often take longer workouts, and more of them. Arnold, for example, was known to work out over three hours per day and six days per week. While certainly you may need to build up a "work capacity" over time by gradually increasing what you do, if you have the energy and inclination to do your lifts after 60 minutes, then by all means do them. If you do find yourself running out of gas, then work on conditioning with the goal of being able to last long enough to complete your scheduled training. 

Well, yes, your math looks fine if you're asking did you scale the nutrient breakdowns down with calories. A much bigger question would be whether this guideline is worth following. That looks like an awful lot of sugar to me, especially if you want to lose weight! 

Reasonable re-definitions can be used for this question if they lead to reasonable and useful metrics. 

I think starting now can only help you. If you're new to it, you're going to be focusing on learning proper technique for now anyway, which will be less impacted by schedule. You may also consider looking into HIT-style training. High-intensity training tends to imply very short workouts and lots of recovery time. For example, in Body By Science (McGuff) recommends only one 10-15 minute workout per week. Of course that 10-15 minutes is intense! No matter how busy you are, you can still find 15 minutes a week... 

It's natural for weight to fluctuate throughout the day. Everything you eat, drink, excrete, sweat has mass and will therefore affect your scale weight. There is no "correct" time to weigh; the most important thing is to be consistent. Pick one time of day and always weigh yourself then to try to reduce the measuring error. I do my own weighings first thing in the morning because I think that's the most consistent time for me, since I don't have to account for variances in what I ate or drank that day. Keep in mind that your absolute weight is a meaningless number (take BMI and other standards with a grain of salt). What's important is how your weight changes relative to what it was before given a consistent measurement process.
