The key issue for a telescope is not magnification but light gathering capability - which is (crudely) the size of the main aperture. Thus a 90x magification on a very large (wide) telescope would let you see a very large number of things (if you are in an area where the sky is dark), but 90x on a small telescope would let you see a number of interesting things (the Moon, planets, some nebulae and star clusters) but not relatively faint objects. Small, cheaper, telescopes are still worth buying if you want to dabble, seeing the Moon through a telescope is always amazing and a small telescope can show lots, for instance. Also, for a small telescope don't go for big magnifications - 90x would be fine for a low cost 50mm refractor for instance. As for where the planets are - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn are generally easy to spot if you look up their positions online and know your way round the constellations. Because the planets are not, as stars effectively are, points at infinite distance, but small disks they (on most nights) do not twinkle as the stars do. 

Saturn's Great White Spot phenomenon often occurs in the Northern hemisphere, so it doesn't look like there is any particular preference. 

To answer your point about why "spacetime" as opposed to space and then time - photons (and other massless particles) travel through spacetime on "null geodesics" - in other words they do not experience time at all. But they are not in some separate class as particles at approach ever closer to the speed of light travel on paths through spacetime that are ever closer to null geodesics. In other words the four dimensional geometry is inextricably linked and "space" and "time" are a unified whole. In theory humans moving also experience this effect but the speed at which we move is far too slow for this ever to manifest itself to our senses. But we do see its impact in high precision timing - such as with GPS satellites. 

Gamma ray bursts are thought to emerge from the poles of supernova, so a star's spin axis would have to be in the right direction for it to hit us. Betelgeuse, a nearby supernova candidate has it's spin axis at an inclination of about 20° to the direction of Earth, so that star is not likely to get us when she blows. However, we don't have accurate information on the direction of the spin axis of most stars. 

Adding to Oceanescence's mention of Gamma Ray Bursts, someone's recently done some calculations: Gamma Ray Bursts Limit The Habitability of Certain Galaxies, Says Study 

Although sources go way back, the current best estimate seems to be that of Abdul Ahad from March 2004: 

How thick is the line? An extended finger is about 30 arcminutes across, the size of the moon, but a line is a line, 0 arcminutes. The Hubble Deepfield, as mentioned by Kilfiger, is only 2.5 arcminutes across, 1/12th of a finger-width, yet contains hundreds of galaxies. If you want to be a stickler for true lines, the image does contain dark space too. At a guess, there's not easily accessible software for counting such things, it looks like 70-80% blackness (ignoring obvious stars), so 1 chance in 5 your line is pointing at a galaxy. 

Pretty thin soup. Sodium and potassium get kicked up by photons hitting the surface. There's also argon, helium and other minor components. As shown in this figure from the first link: The sodium in that atmosphere does glow; (Rayleigh unit definition). At least some of the glow is due to full fledged ions rather than charge-neutral fluorescence: 

Caveat: I'm not a cosmologist, so this answer may not reflect the forefront of scientific knowledge/accuracy, but I have some knowledge so thought I'd share it and hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong. The Big Bang theory states that everything is moving away from everything else, so it must have started closer together. We know from the Cosmic Microwave Background that everything was very dense and hot and small. You may have heard that the universe started in a singularity. This means one point at which all matter was in the same place. In this state, all information in matter is lost. No particle can be labelled as having a position or size or spin, because every particle is in the same state as every other particle. This means we lose all possibility of having any information about what happened before this. There are many theories of what could have been before this, but no matter how simple/beautiful/mathematically rigorous the theory, it is physically impossible to know anything about it so they are impossible to test. In some definitions this makes these theories not actually science, as the scientific method involves making testable predictions. 

You want to use this to find the distance from the planet to the star, using trigonometry and converting to the correct units 

A lot of the data we have on the inner structure of the Earth comes from seismology - the study of earthquake waves travelling through the ground. This requires sensors placed at different points around the planet to pick up the waves and infer the structures they passed through. I haven't looked into it but I would think that this would be very difficult to do on other planets in terms of getting lots of sensors there and positioning them correctly, so maybe we just don't know this sort of thing about other planets yet! 

HD 219134b is apparently closest "super earth"; 21 light years away. New Horizons, our speediest yet, is currently running at about 15 km/sec relative to the sun. At 9.46e12 km/lightyear HD 219134b is 2e14 km away At 3.16e7 seconds per year, New Horizons will travel about 4.74e8 km/year. 2e14/4.74e8 = 422000 years. HD 219134b isn't even a very good earth; gravity is too high. 

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is still up there. At a compact 2000kg, it's likely too small to see via earth based telescope. Mission Page I think the Chinese orbiter is back on earth now, but there may be others. 

To see the milky way, you need merely go out at night somewhere where there is a dark, clear sky. In northern hemisphere fall and winter, you'll also be able to see the nearest large galaxy, M31. The large and small Magellanic clouds, visibly grace southern skies. If you live in a city, a cloudy, hazy or very humid region, you're out of luck, unless you can get out into unspoiled countryside. Modern digital cameras are far more sensitive than the human eye. 

Technically, yes, the moon does have an atmosphere that gets ionized by the sun. NASA: Is There an Atmosphere on the Moon? 

If dark energy varied by location, then plots of 1a supernova brightness vs redshift should vary depending on which direction you look in the sky. AFAIK, that's not the case. For example, although coords are not accounted for, there's not a lot of scatter in this plot: 

I think this is suggesting that the star is 3 pc from us (the observer), and you need to find the distance of the planet from it's star. If the 3 pc was the distance of the planet from the star, then the question is just asking you to convert parsecs to AU, which is very easy and would make the information about the angular radius useless. So this is the information you have: 

Today the LIGO consortium are having a press conference to update us on their search for gravitational waves. How should I watch the announcement? 

In a published scientific paper, the significance of any error bars should be explained. If this has not been clearly stated then peer review is not doing it's job. However, in some fields there may be unstated conventions which slip through without explanation. In my own field (star formation) plots which shows averages over a large data set would show means with error bars representing one standard deviation, while plots which show single measured values might have error bars representing calculated uncertainties on the measurement, for example due to detection limits or instrumental uncertainties. 

Quick answer: no I think the problem the use of the word "energy" here. Energy comes in many forms, such as heat, electrical energy, kinetic energy... The energy released by a supernova is kinetic (material being thrown out into space), electromagnetic (light created by atomic interactions), etc. Gravitational waves are not like light waves. They are only created by the movement of mass. So the material being thrown off will produce gravitational waves, the spinning of a star or stellar remnant will produce gravitational waves, but the masses and speeds involved are so much lower. Black holes have 10 or 100 times the amount of mass of a single star, and binary black holes are orbiting each other incredibly fast (the peak speed of the GW150914 black holes was 60% the speed of light), so they will produce much stronger gravitational waves, but not as much light. 

The Right Ascension of a star is fixed (ignoring precession of the equinoxes). What you need or want to know is the "sidereal time" - that is to say the "time" based on which RA is at your local meridian at a given time. The sidereal day is slightly shorter than the mean solar day (ie the 24 hour day) and so sidereal and solar times drift apart - only being equivalent at the vernal equinox. 

The Big Bang happened everywhere and the recombination of electrons with nuclei - the thing that causes the CMB - also happened everywhere. So in every direction you look you can see the radiation from that recombination. But that recombination also happened a long time ago and so, given light has a constant velocity, the places where we can see the recombination take place are also a long way away. And, as a result of the expansion of space-time, that radiation is very red-shifted, so instead of the recombination looking like it is happening at roughly 4000 degrees Kelvin, it looks like something happening at 3 degrees Kelvin. That expansion is also what makes it look like the distant galaxies are all moving away from us and the further away the faster they seem to be moving. 

There are lots of reasons. First of all because we can see that a typical galaxy is a spiral galaxy and we seem to live somewhere pretty typical. Secondly because we can see the arms of the spiral through close examination of the Milky Way (ie the band in the sky) - through stellar distances and measurements of hydrogen cloud red shifts and so on. But you your question is a perfectly good one because, ultimately, we are guessing a bit as we cannot see the galaxy from anywhere other than one vantage point. 

Jupiter is highly dynamic: Jupiter Animated Video Gallery (be sure to look at storm merger video) Differences Spotted in Jupiter's Big Red Storms Jupiter's New Red Spot Jupiter Loses Big Belt; Great Spot Left Hanging The persistence of Jupiter's Red spot is in fact a bit of a mystery. 

IEEE Spectrum recently ran a piece on detecting exoplanets: DIY Exoplanet Detector - You don’t need a high-powered telescope to spot the signature of an alien world 

Gravity plus dark energy reportedly can combine to do awful things to the amount of energy in the universe: 

In reality, both the extent of refraction of the sun's disk and the refraction of the apparent horizon come into play. Both depend on the atmosphere's density and temperature profile; which changes irregularly. That makes it impossible to predict exact sunrise or sunset times when there is an atmosphere. 

So, whether by ionic or fluorescent emission, the moon's atmosphere does glow. Unless one wants to argue about the glow not being restricted to the poles by a magnetic field, or airglow, that glow counts as an aurora. 

Off to the north and east like that, it's likely refracted early sunrise. That's a lot of streetlights for that time of the day; likely a longish exposure to capture aurora. That'd increase sunrise glare as well. 

Stereo Vision? Optically, you'll need something like a couple big Fisheye lenses mounted on a helmet. Looking straight through such optics yields horrible distortion, so you'd have to feed the lens' output into CCD/CMOS sensors, and massage that into flattened images your eyes can handle, on a video screen. Perhaps Google Cardboard? Probably doable and light enough to wear. A straight optical approach to correcting the fisheyes would probably end up too heavy to lift.
