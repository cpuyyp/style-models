Start by Making a Wikipedia Article Not a real one, but create a Wikipedia Article. I randomly entered "Hungarians" into Wikipedia to get an example. Design their history; define their geography, or, if this culture is imagined to be on Earth with us, then what regions have their population? More from the "Hungarians" article as a prototype. 

I'm going to steal Samuel's suggestion and add onto it. Newly Arrived Migrant Like all migrants, there will be people who welcome and do not welcome them. All of the experiences she has are well-developed literary and TV/Movie tropes. Her psychological response will be to either quickly try to assimilate or the opposite, to grasp onto her foreign identity. As she is a visual migrant (people can tell by seeing her), she will have a tougher time. During WWII there were internment camps for Japanese-Americans, but not German-Americans, largely because there was a visual difference (and a million other reasons, this is hugely generalized). Her psychological response will be despair at not being able to assimilate since she will always be 'different'. She will latch onto and maybe even abuse the generosity of those few who will accept her; either way she will gravitate towards them and remain in service toward them. Hiding Identity The psychological effects of having to hide who you are is well-talked about also. A hispanic person who 'passes' as white in a racially divisive community, or of course an LGBT person in a hostile environment. The duration and stress of being 'in the closet' as a human will take its toll in ways too long to list here. But again, she will gravitate to her allies or humanoids who will accept her for who she is. Egress from Prison This will be tough. I hope you can stress in your story the sense of both freedom and confusion from entering the world after being in prison. I don't know how long she was there, though. If it was a long time, she will be very disoriented. Entry to a New Planet New planet means new rules. Much like a newly arrived migrant, she will be frustrated every time she tries to do something new. I helped a Pakistani migrant with the use of an ATM, and you could tell he was flustered. The result is that she will not do anything she doesn't have to do. The frustration will take its toll on her and she will become withdrawn and afraid to engage with the humanoids, because there are so many things she cannot understand. Unlike a child, adults aren't fascinated with extended bouts of trial-and-error. Happy writing! 

Our society would change. Note that these are high-level, not getting into technicalities of democracies; also I'm assuming that everyone over 18 is able to use a computer and most vote. Education Issue - One of the reasons America has (now useless?) electoral colleges was to represent those who weren't educated to vote (it was a bit more nefarious, but whatever). BUT now you have every 18 year old getting an e-mail asking them to vote on the Justice Reinvestment Act (as an example), without having heard of it; or even people who've only watched the news, and haven't read the actual bill. Politicians are currently requested to fully read and understand an issue and vote on it the way that they believe their constituents would vote. Whether this happens, is a different thing. Majority Rules - Your change would result in a majority-rules at all times. I'm not saying this is a good/bad thing, but it takes us far away from a representative democracy that protects special interests. Increased Results for Referendums - Increasing the ease by which referendums are voted on would increase voter turnout. Still Not Protected - Even if the cyber-security is watertight, there's nothing preventing voter fraud: even my boyfriend could steal my vote by going on my computer. Maybe you could have fingerprint scanners or something. Overwhelming - Ain't nobody got time fo dat. There are 6,261 bills and resolutions currently before the United States Congress alone. Perhaps you could have them shortlisted by a representative, but this defeats the purpose. Sneaky Representation - Somebody has to write those 6,261 bills, and they don't write the bills that they don't want to be before congress. Of course, that kind of affects us now. 

In my particular Earth, much has remained after the human-killing virus, and nature is thriving - even taking over the cities. It's beautiful. But I have separated the healthy populace in orbit until it was safe to return. In a near-future scenario, where I have rescued only a few non-related people from Portland, Oregon (not-relevant, but I thought someone might ask), they're ready to return to Earth after 3 years or so in space. Setting aside their trials upon return, etc., how many random people should I preserve in space when humanity is almost wiped out, for relatively clean genetics? Is there even such a thing? I realize this is purely speculative, but I'd like the fewest possible people and would welcome some scientific reasoning so that I don't end up with genetically distressed children / population. EDIT, as requested: Infrastructure, technology forests, roads & bridges, etc., are all only about 3 years old without people. There are many machines and materials; this question is purely for genetics-sake. 

I have a large rotating (think wagonwheel) portion of a space-craft that, at the hub, connects to a non-rotating scientific research station. Imagine a football (soccer) field sized research and logistics station in microgravity, connected to a hub of a rotating space colony. The floating scientists in the football field get to the hub, and then travel by ladder (or lift) to the spinning, near-Earth gravity colony. My problem is connecting electricity (okay that's easy) as well as water, drainage, and sewerage from the non-rotating part to the rotating part. It needs to be one system. Has this been considered before? It's doing my head in. 

After two to three days of dehydration, Bob would perish. So Bob has water and disposal of water; after two to three unpleasant weeks without food, Bob will perish. So Bob has water, disposal, and food... it's up to him how long he can bear to be with himself in a breathing/eating/drinking/poop/pee apparatus. 

Federally Mandated Removal of Agricultural Subsidy I struggled to think what interests these states could possibly have in common. They are all states either highly dependent on agricultural subsidy, or very strongly associated with a state that is. In 2005, US farmers received $14 billion in agricultural subsidies. This is peanuts to the American budget, but this is suddenly a dramatic loss of income to groups of individuals and corporations who are highly connected and clustered in areas. The value percentage of agricultural revenue in each rebelling state is tiny compared to other sectors, but it is a direct economic sector (e.g. - almost directly from the producer). Manufacturing includes a whole range of economic activities, while agriculture is food, food production, and food distribution; often in one company. Here's why they rebelled. 

In order to acheive a healthy mangrove, you need temperate to tropical climate, salt-water, lots of active fauna (for fertilizer), and very gentle tides for very gentle flushing in an area. These are in Abu Dhabi, photos courtesy me (except for the last one, below), but I can provide more info at great length if you want. 

It's fine-ish. It happens already, the aliens have friends here on Earth. Rhizobia and other bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen for us higher order species on a regular basis, since we can't use atmospheric nitrogen anyway. Atmospheric Nitrogen constitutes a large portion of the atmosphere, so you will have a few years of climactic effects, but on the ground, not a huge difference (other than effects of climate change), because the vast majority of atmosphere is in the 5km-16km location, not the 1% or so that we live in. So brace yourselves for weather issues and very fertile growth. I hope the Aliens come hungry. 

Define intelligent. To me, the level of intelligence should only be quantified by "The life form is also found to have...." In which case, we have birds, mammals, and crustaceans, among others, that do this. So, I would not call it a being with the ability to reason. But an Octopus could be considered intelligent. Do you mean beings able to reason? Then, without other information, no I wouldn't. I could guess that it may be sentient, as in, able to have subjective perceptual experiences. More information would have to be gathered, which is why biology is fun.
