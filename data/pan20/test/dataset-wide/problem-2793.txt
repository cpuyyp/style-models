Part of your question is a misinterpretation of Kant. noumenon are not things in themselves, but we can address each piece separately. The misunderstanding happens because of a confusion about how knowledge works Kant. While we cannot know the things themselves, this is because of how we know. [God, in fact, can know them.] because God does not filter things through forms and categories. The answer is that Plato does think we can know what Kant might call "noumenon" but that's because the closest thing is the forms which is in soul. On the other hand, the things behind the phenomenon are on Plato's view either the forms or just the shifting shadows of the world we live in which is inadequate to contain forms. What the two have in common then is a belief that the real goods are in the soul from before birth / in the mind of a rational being as categories and that the world is shadow. The neo-Kantians of the 19th Century were also Platonists after a sort, so you're not the first to note the similarity. 

There are two main problems with this argument. As a historical note, Kant's moral philosophy is not wholly captured by a single formulation of the categorical imperative in the Groundwork. Kant also wrote and published a volume called Metaphysics of Morals which subdivides into the "Metaphysics of Right" and "Metaphysics of Morals". You also need to consider what Kant thinks in Religion within the bounds of reason alone (which is a work primarily of moral philosophy). The issue that happens which undermines the suggestion you are making is that Kant was opposed to all forms of what he would call drunkenness (as distinct from drinking). Kant has no problem with imposing harsh penalties on these sorts of cases. All of this highlights a problem with what you capture under the term policy. viz., isn't the policy meant to further humanity, as in the good of people, on some level? In other words, if we unpack the term policy as humanity: 

Many German thinkers thought Greek and German had a special link -- "inner relationship of the German language with the language of the Greeks and with their thought”. (Quotations from Only a God can Save Us 113 [quoted from SEP linked above].) I don't think it greatly influenced Heidegger, but Hegel also thought philosophy started with the Greeks and that the Romans interrupted with codification and other things. It's quite possible this was a common thought taught in German classical education. Heidegger thought the Romance languages where under the sway of metaphysics and didn't have the ability to break free to primordial being. Ergo, he thinks they're not going to be useful for getting to Being. 

There are several different continental philosophies that need not agree with each other. Some of these are Marxist in orientation or need Marxism in some sort of strong way. Most do not. 

Your question at least on a quick reading seems to be using terms a bit will nilly. Let's start by defining terms. Background Statement - a claim that can be either true or false. Some examples: 

Two points of caution: But that being said, if the premise is unnecessary to the argument, then it could be excised and produce a valid or sound argument (or an invalid or unsound argument). Ergo, if we excise (3), then the argument would be sound. A principle of charitable reading would tell us to ignore the extraneous premise. Second, be careful of claiming that (C) A -> B is false when A is false. (Confusing the falseness of a claim for the falseness of a premise. 

The master wants to be recognized as a master But to be recognized as a master someone must recognize him as master And this turns out to be his slave Thus, the master turns out to need the slave 

Here, I think the key is the word "made". The same idea is expressed in their longer definition. Seems pretty clear that this is how the term is most often used and does require intention. 

Justifying something based on the consequences it led to. Justifying something based on the consequences we expect it would lead to. 

Returning to the claim Let's look at this from both potential problems. First, there's a huge question of what anyone means by a "free will." I think it'd be fair to say that Hegel isn't a big fan of the belief that you have a completely arbitrary will that can pick anything willy-nilly. Instead, he thinks the will makes rational choices, which is going to greatly limit its options. So far this is partially just a rehashing of the difference between randomness and free will. Where there's potential to say Hegel is not a fan of free will is (I think) in three places. First, necessity has a big role in Hegel's philosophy. How exactly it works is a bit opaque, but Hegel's main mature project is the idea that spirit has been discovering its world and itself and its nature as free and rational, and that there are necessary steps in this (both necessary for its maturation and necessitated in history). So, the progress of history is arguably determined, but in Hegel's vocabulary it would still be "free" because these are the things that reason takes us to. Second, rational choices occur within perspectival frameworks for Hegel. What you can perceive as possibly sensible is guided by your reason which occurs within a culture. (It is not at least on my reading arbitrary or unhinged relativism that makes this so for Hegel). This is why the book where Hegel works on this the most is called Philosophy of Right -- because what's going on is a two-fold process of discovery -- the will discovers it is free and then figures out how freedom plays out in the world, marching through ideas like possession, contract, crime, family, marriage, and society and the state. These structures limit what it is right for the will to do and thus what a rational will would do. Finally, there's a big place where he's not a fan of free will: faith. Across a lot of texts, it becomes clear that he does not think you should choose to believe something that sets you apart from your society. Nor should you have independent values (See the note to section 105 of Philosophy of Right) There's a lot more going on that makes his view dissimilar to a kind of Cartesian soul's free will or a Kantian moral self's. But to sum up, he thinks he's a fan of free will (in the free, rational will), but what he means by "free will" might not be compatible with what you mean. 

A good way to grasp this is to think about Descartes' project (or perhaps better stated his supposed project). A common claim is that Descartes is this radical skeptic bent on doubting everything, but if you read the Meditations carefully, he's already said this is not going to work by the end of the first meditation. In fact, Descartes' project turns into one where he believes that things which are "clear and distinct" are unfalsifiable. Now, I mention this not because I think you need to agree with Descartes but to point out a pattern -- for many types of epistemologies, including Humeanism empiricism, Cartesian rationalism, and Kant's, you are going to have some beliefs that of critical importance that are not falsifiable, because these are the beliefs that make other beliefs both verifiable, possible, and falsifiable. So for instance, Kant has a theory of mind for which he argues, but the main value of it is that this theory enables him to move past skepticism about objects outside the self and to explain how the self comprehends objects. Then we can argue about particular objects and about sensibles and other things. But if we don't get that off the ground, then we can't do much. A later example might be James' critique of Clifford (from what I understand James' critique is rather unfair but that's not the point). The basic thrust is that you cannot have a principle of universal doubt that stands up to itself -- so you have to have at least something you take to be non-falsifiable to do anything. Are there ways of trying to avoid this? Yes, you can try to compose a set of things where every particular is falsifiable but the set as a whole (or even if some fail) provides this support. 

IF 1, then the state is actual because it cannot be understood as pure ideality. And it would follow Hegel thinks he's at the end of history -- since the content of §360 requires that. IF 2, then Hegel's got a potential problem in that his philosophy has become merely speculative rather than concrete, and we cannot trust the deliverances of Grundlinien to be deliverances of Reason [Vernunft]... 

Then repeat 5-10 for the assumption B is valid as a proof that if B is valid, then A is not valid. This may be what you meant to say with your sentence, but it's not clear enough. A clearer wording is that their conclusions are incompossible and the premises are true, so at least one argument must not be valid since if both were valid both conclusions would follow necessarily. 

Non-religious metaphysics This may not be the best way to title it, but we also see non-religious metaphysics earlier in the West. Meaning if we look at what Aristotle and Plato are doing, they do a ton of metaphysics not founded in their culture's religion. And we see that continue in the Hellenistic period and keep going. Confucius, Laozi, Mencius, Zhuangzi have implicit metaphysics and some of it is not especially religious, but no one is arguing about the nature of being in quite so explicit terms in the East. To get that we need to wait for the I-Ching to be taken as a foundational work and integrated into these thought-streams as philosophy. (i.e., the advent of 理 li -- not to be confused with 禮 li). 

Addendum: I think information is used in contemporary philosophy of mind in forms that are like neuroscience as a technical term, but I am not sufficiently versed in that area to comment on where specifically it fits into the whole epistemological framework. 

You seem to be saying we cannot know what we mean when we call the apple red. That strikes me as quite strange. I think we mean that an apple has a certain color. Or more generally, it sounds like we are asserting some object has some property. But you're telling us we are doing something we cannot understand. A second related issue might make it clearer. It seems we can also make negative predications: the apple is not green. But is this too to be seen as unanalyzable? If so, how? It seems we are saying, this apple does not fit with this property. When you state (2), 

Analogous Policy Questions Your answer to question (1) generates a component of moral hazard that compounds the degree to which the lying might be wrong. And it makes you wholly responsible for your choice in a way that people are not when they act in accordance with flawed policies. To flush that out, if a country sets a speed limit too low and your speeding kills someone, that's different in terms of guilt than if the country has set it too high and you're going a legal speed kills someone. In the latter cases, your driving at that speed is licensed by the government and while you can still be complicit for killing someone, it may be a fault of the policy rather than your judgment (it could still be the fault of your judgment despite the policy). In the former cases, it's all on you. Speeding transfers society's burden of responsibility onto you. You can also consider this with drunk driving. Similarly, giving blood against the policy transfers responsibility for the consequences onto you. Now, depending on the moral theory you subscribe to, this can refer either to the realized consequences or to the potential consequences from the perspective of sound policy. In other words, on some theories, you are acting deeply immorally if you speed / drive drunk / give blood against policy even if no negative thing actually happens. On other theories, only if something bad happens have you done wrong. This is called moral hazard, and it represents a pretty substantial problem. After that, it boils down to the lying question and whether that's sufficiently wrong to block other behaviors
