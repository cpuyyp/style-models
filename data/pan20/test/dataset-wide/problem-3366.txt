What is the term for the combination of nouns and conjunctions found in the subject position? "Compound noun" doesn't quite seem to fit the bill here. 

Visually representing this is quite easy - you simply cross some lines on a piece of paper (example, again, pilfered from Wikipeda): 

In most of the literature I have encountered thus far, the terms "constituency grammar" and "phrase structure grammar" seem to be used interchangeably. Is either one of the two more acceptable or preferable than the other? 

Formally representing constituency based structures, using brackets to denote constituents, is straight-forward - until discontinuities are thrown in the mix. Consider this example, adapted from this Wikipedia article: 

What software do lexicographers use these days to manage and search corpora? Is there a standard solution used by most people, or does every dictionary commission their own software to suit their own needs? I struggle to find anything online in this regard, which leads me to believe that a bunch of really arcane software is being used :) p.s. - I'm not sure whether this actually belongs here. Please let me know if this belongs to a different SE site? 

Sentences in the active voice can be converted to the passive voice by - amongst other maneuvers - moving the direct object into the position originally occupied by the grammatical subject. Does this make it the new grammatical subject of the sentence? If so, what is the original subject now called? If not, how are subject and object(s) classified after the conversion? 

Not sure if this is a silly question, but: is there a standardised symbol or abbreviation that can be used in formal definitions to refer to particles? Writing "PARTICLE" or "PART" sounds...silly... 

It refers to the set of "correct" part of speech tags assigned to the tokens (words and punctuation) in a corpus of sentences. The tags are usually annotated and vetted manually by linguistic experts, and used to train and test classifiers, parsers and other processing resources used to process natural language. 

In some dependency treebanks for Germanic languages, nouns in subject position are assigned the governors of their corresponding predicative adjectives, as opposed to the copular verb connecting the two. Is this compatible with what is currently accepted from a purely theoretical linguistic approach? (There seem to be a number of a-linguistic decisions taken in NLP applications - the Stanford Universal Dependencies handling of content words over function words come to mind. So I'm wondering whether this is one of them.) 

Is there a generally accepted classification of the "headedness" of Germanic noun phrases? (Some sources use the term head medial".) Are there works on the matter that is considered authoritative and generally accepted by the linguistics community? 

If you want to establish the origins of a language, there are two main things which have to be taken into consideration: basic vocabulary, and grammar. The former is what would weigh the most, were one to engage in evaluating the average occurrence of each word in the literary corpus of a given language, as you suggested in the question. In the case of English, this is overwhelmingly Germanic. The fact that in the total vocabulary of a certain language at a given time in history there may indeed be more words of foreign origin should not surprise you. For instance, were someone to have created a similar pie-chart for the Romanian language spoken (more than) one or two centuries ago, the majority of its total number of words would have been of Slavic origin, despite the fact that Romanian is a Romance language, descending from Latin, which can be quite easily noticed by evaluating its basic vocabulary, and grammar. 

No, there is no etymological connection between the two. In English, -ard and -art are suffixes, used in the formation of many words. The word suggests hag as a root, and is related to the German hag(er), having a similar meaning. (In German, -er is also a suffix). 

Technically, everything is possible, but, given the fact that Romanian has a Thracian/Dacian substrate, I'd say that it's unlikely at best. Of course, it is not theoretically impossible that, for some mysterious reason, these two distant Indo-European branches (Gaulish and Dacian) might have shared some phonetic similarity insofar -v- and/or -b- are concerned, but it seems much more likelier that Latin itself is the cause, since, as far as we know, this is the only common denominator between French and Romanian. 

Since I replied yep rather than yes, I am hereby exempt from answering this question. ;-) Joke aside, just take a good look at the map of Europe, and tell me what you notice, even at a superficial glance, regarding the geographic position of Romania vs. that of Western European Romance speaking countries ? 

For one very simple reason : in Romanian, unless one does not purposefully wish to sound either poetic or theatrical, the adjective follows the noun rather than preceding it. Therefore, Noapte buna !, Ziua buna !, S(e)ara buna !, O dupa-amiaza placuta !, Duminica placuta ! or O saptamana frumoasa (sa aveti) ! are actually quite standard. So a more logical question would be why do certain inverted expressions, such as Buna ziua ! or Buna seara !, still exist in the first place ? My hunch would be that it is precisely this type of common phrases which, by sheer virtue of being among the oldest in any language, are more likely to preserve antiquated features (such as obsolete word order, for instance). Just think of the famous English expression Pop goes the weasel !, which is phrased in this peculiar, almost poetic sounding way, because of an archaic characteristic of Proto-Germanic, now only preserved in Nordic languages, namely verb second (commonly abbreviated as V2). 

There are also languages that have more than singular, dual, plural. A good overview is provided by Corbett 2000, which is an really good overview over the category of Number in general. Here are some examples he gives (§ 2.2): 

It is a controversial question if there is a true quadral (for “four) -- and some languages also have special encoding for “large numbers” though there is a lot of variation going on. The wikipedia article on grammatical number is also quite good. Literature Corbett, Greville G. 2000. Number. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 

The issue of what happens with a proposition in case of a failed presuppositions is still not settled. There is a huge pile of literature on this matter, so let me just quickly sketch the three main positions, using the classic case of: (1) The present king of France is bald. 

The mechanism of Agree(ment) has been redefined since Chomsky 1995. Since Chomsky 2000, 2001, it does not rely on Spec-Head agreement anymore. Regarding the relation between the subject and V, if suggest to have a look at Pesetsky & Torrego 2007, who give important references and develop a slightly different, but influential departure from Chomsky's 2000, 2001 definition. Adger 2003 is a good book, but note that his version of agreement is non-standard (as it work up- and downwards). Literature Chomsky, Noam (2000): “Minimalist inquiries: e framework”.

Still the best overview over the historical development of the (technical) of presupposition is provided in the first part of Beaver 2001, which you can access here.
