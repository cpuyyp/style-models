The US sets K-12 math exams. Where did he get that from? Tests are set by states at most. There is a US National Board of Education. Well, it's true that there is a Finnish National Board of Education, and various State Boards of Education (California, Illinois, etc.). At the national level in the US however there's only the US Department of Education and the US National Board for Education Sciences. The latter conducts surveys on which it bases statistics about US education. But no, there is no US National Board of Education. Everyone involved in this alleged nationwide test (including Mr. Trice himself at first) allegedly believed that the point of the question was to test whether the student could identify the largest three-digit number, namely 999. Yet the question was not worded that way, but instead as in the puzzle, namely "largest number representable with three digits". What a remarkable coincidence that this awkward wording would exactly match that of the puzzle question. Even had the puzzle question never existed, none of the many people that would be involved in reviewing a nationwide test would appear to have pointed out that the question would be clearer and less ambiguous if its obviously convoluted wording were simplified to the more direct "the largest three-digit number". Had anyone done so there would be no reason not to simplify and clarify it. Examiners take great care to avoid any ambiguity in tests. It's extremely unlikely this wording would have escaped notice. Apparently not one of the hundreds of thousands of people involved in setting, taking, and grading this test had ever run across this cute puzzle. Yet it was a relatively well-known puzzle by then (see Background above). What is the probability that no one involved in the test had ever heard of this puzzle? I would expect extremely low. None of the hundreds of thousands of people allegedly affected by this seismic regrading breathed a word of this fascinating story to the press, which would have made front page news out of such an astonishingly heart-rending story. Instead the first exposure of the story to the public was eight years after the event, and moreover by the father of the one person in the whole country, allegedly, who noticed the 9^9^9 solution. 

Diesel engines used to be not only lower specific power but also slower max speed and lower power / car weight. This means that preferred driving style could pretty much decide the type of engine. Gasoline for "sportive" driving style (which is much more demanding on the car, lots of load-cycle changes), diesel for calm/slow driving style. The "long-lasting" was an important sales argument, aiming at people who drive a lot. This means, that those cars were more likely to end up far more in long-distance driving than gasoline cars at the time. While the question is about modern diesel engines, I think this historic situation needs to be taken into account because that is where the long-lasting reputation of the diesel comes from. Note for judging the OP's article that it was also not a "cheaper" but a "more economic if you go long distances" reputation. And it was no "cheaper repair" reputation. Meanwhile diesel car engines have much higher specific and total power. Look e.g. at the BMW N57 engines (e.g. 242 kW, 4.4 l) or the Mercedes-Benz W221 (235 kW, 4 l) Those BMW 7 series and Mercedes S class diesel cars are restricted to vmax 250 km/h, just like the gasoline ones (though these series have gasoline engines with still more power). Hints about the lifetime of modern diesel engines. 

This video (2:10 onwards) shows Van Eck phreaking working with a CRT monitor, although it claims that the process works through the cable, not the monitor itself; if that is true, then it would work regardless of the display technology. It also claims that keyboard data can be captured too. I find that difficult to believe. 

Very simply, it could but with modern electrical safety systems, it's unlikely. A modern television is not earthed, as the casing is usually plastic, although some bigger sets have grounds. The reason for this is because the class Y capacitors used to filter EMI require an earth conductor. Bigger sets emit more EMI because they use more power, thus can require an earth connector. In which case, earth must be connected to exposed metal parts, if any. If they have a direct ground, water is likely to short live to the earthed case and trip the RCD/GFCI within 30 ms, with a current as low as 30mA. A general rule is that you can feel 1mA, 10mA is painful and 100mA can stop the heart. As you can't get out, this leads to death... and it's not nice. If not, then it could be fatal if the bathtub is not correctly earthed which according to regulations it must be. If the bathtub is earthed, the water will allow enough current to flow from live to earth to trip the RCD/GFCI. It would hurt, but you'd be able to get out usually. Modern household RCD/GFCI devices will trip on the current required to cause fibrilation - often much lower to make it safer. Note that RCD/GFCI devices don't measure earth current but instead the imbalance between live and neutral so even without a proper mains earth for the bath they will work. All that is important is that the current has some way to avoid going from live to neutral. If that is through the plumbing, it could save your life, though any assailant throwing TVs at you is likely to have more devious plans in mind. 

Any one of these inconsistencies in his story should constitute strong circumstantial evidence. All six of them simultaneously is simply unbelievable. But with what motive? (Circumstantial evidence is always stronger when there's a motive, such as making more money with watered-down milk.) What purpose could be served by making up this story? And why now, instead of at the time eight years ago? I can think of two possible motives. One would be to aggrandize the Trice family. But that doesn't explain why now. A motive I find more plausible given the timing is the passage three months ago of the Every Student Succeeds Act. This superseded the No Child Left Behind Act, some of whose more objectionable features had been providing opponents of Common Core with ammunition for attacking it. With NCLB gone, new objections to Common Core had to be mounted. Trice's creative little story evidently serves this purpose (he says so himself), with the additional benefit that those susceptible to arguments against Common Core are likely to find the story more viscerally understandable than the more esoteric issues that had bedeviled NCLB. 

1000 seed weight is 26.74 g according to Kew Gardens seed database. 0.06 - 0.2 mg CN⁻/g apple seed gives 1,6 - 5.3 mg CN⁻/1000 apple seeds My old paper pharmacology and toxicology textbook (Estler: Lehrbuch der allgemeinen und systematischen Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Schattauer 1990.) gives 1 mg CN⁻/kg body weight as lethal dose. The CDC info linked by the claim agrees with that. Thus, for the standard human of 70 kg, about 70 mg of CN⁻ are lethal. I.e. eating (and chewing) 350 - 1170 g of apple seeds, which translates to roughly 13000 - 44000 seeds. Now, I didn't find citable numbers of seeds per fruit for apples (the claim assumes 10 seeds/apple - which I judge is a plausible number), but for the claim that 20 apples contain a fatal amount of CN⁻ to be true, with the numbers above, each apple would need to contain 660 to 2200 seeds. I'd judge that this is about 2 orders of magnitude off. 

The question asks for corroborative evidence for Mr. Trice's story. Given his stone-walling I would expect that the best possible answer would be strong circumstantial evidence that no such evidence exists, like Thoreau's trout-in-the-milk circumstantial evidence that the dairy farmer had been watering down his milk. Background: The problem in the test is a puzzle that has made the rounds of the web since the early days of search engines and no doubt much earlier (beyond the reach of the wayback machine). Unraveledideas mentioned a 2002 appearance, but it can be found even earlier, in 1997 at $URL$ for example, and I've seen the puzzle at various other sites both before and after 2008 (the date of the test). At every such site with a comment section, there are usually many comments and of course many more who are lurkers. It can also be found in books, e.g. puzzle number 634 on p.236 of Terry Stickel's 2006 "The Big Book of Mind-bending Puzzles" (which explicitly forbids 999 as a solution). With that background, Trice is asking us to believe the following. Judge for yourself which of these six potential inconsistencies tend to undermine his story and to what extent. 

There is an interesting trend in test scores in exams (GCSE and A-level) in the UK: they are increasing, or so the trend in the grades would tend to show. This is known as grade inflation and affects other countries, too. Why is this? I have heard several reasons. The first is that students are just generally getting smarter. The second reason I have heard is that exams are getting easier. To me (as a student), it personally seems like the exams are getting easier, although it is hard to judge. What independent research has been performed to determine if it is exams or students? 

improves performance; and/or improves engine longevity; and/or improves mileage so that money is saved on fuel, even when taking into account the extra cost of it 

Often when anchors in the studio are talking to reporters or people from a long distance, there is a small delay in the response, maybe one or two seconds. This got me thinking, why is there such a delay? I've observed the delay seems mostly independent of distance, from as little as half a second to as much as five seconds. Also, the transmission delays don't add up: you could send a broadcast around the Earth in about 500ms by pinging e.g. Japan from where I am, over the internet, and a video link is far simpler (with fixed latencies mostly.) Perhaps it is a deliberate delay created by the reporter, so they have time to think about the answer to a question; or perhaps it is added by the studio so that in case a man-in-the-street interview goes a bit bad they can cut it off? 

These findings together with an overall increase of early failing machines hint that the proportions of cheaper vs. more expensive machines may have changed as well. And last but not least, the study says that the age of laundry machines when arriving at the recycling facilities has decreased, but they cannot say whether/how much can be attributed to 

Conclusion of this search: long distance drivers certainly prefer diesel (the < 5 year olds). Nowadays, gasoline cars can reach the same mileage of several 100.000 km (inspecting the higher mileages of the < 5 and 5 - 10 year old cars - disregarding > 999.999 km, as one needs to carefully look for typos that add a digit and obviously meaningless mileages like the 999999). 

The FDA has a number of "sped up" programs for drug approval, that on the first glance seem to fit the claim (I don't have access to the full paper). 

First of all, unfortunately, I don't have scientific papers or statistics about this (I found statistics on age, on mileage and on % diesels, but not age and mileage wrt. diesel or gasoline) - and googling isn't very effective because tons of non-scientific stuff comes up. But I hope I can contribute a few hints of evidence, and I want to point out a number of confounding factors which have a large influence on the lifetime of an engine. And one important consideration is what "more freqently" means. Per 100.000 km? Per year (difficult for new cars)? Per engine (i.e. which percentage of engines "dies" by engine failure - in my experience: very few of both sorts)? Summary: a search on car sales pages indicates that gasoline cars can reach a mileage of several 100.000 km nowadays, like diesel cars. Though (at least here in Germany) diesel cars are preferred by the long distance drivers. While such preference is probably not only based on expected lifetime, and that may have a lag from the long-lasting reputation of the diesel even if this is not true any longer, it also isn't evidence in favour of diesels being dramatically worse than gasoline engines. Long version: I came across two more newspaper articles in German language with claims roughly along the cited one: 

I'm somewhat sceptical of the claims of fuel companies, especially given the price of premium fuel. Have independent tests been performed? 

This got me thinking: does this 24-48 hour period really exist, or is it just so they can cover themselves in case unforeseen problems occur? 

There seems to be little doubt in public opinion that second hand smoke is dangerous, and I can see why. But many smokers have claimed to me that it is not dangerous at all and it is all media hype. What is the scientific consensus? I have heard that second hand smoking is almost equivalent to smoking a cigarette directly. 

That means producing 25 Wh of electricity produces 0.034 lb of CO2 (about 15.4 grams.) An average tree absorbs from 22 pounds (1 tonne / 100 years) to 48 pounds of CO2 per year (depending on who you ask - these are quite pro-tree planting, so I'd like to see if there is a source of raw data); there does not seem to be any definite figure given. That means one tree could support from 647 to 1,411 hand drying sessions. But you can get far more paper from the average tree. This paper suggests that from just one cord of wood (8ft x 4ft x 4ft), smaller than a whole tree, you could produce 942,000 sheets of paper (A5 size, normal density.) Even if you used 10 sheets per session, it's still 66x better (in the best case for hand dryers!) And, you can recycle the paper used. So no, hand dryers are not better. 

... which means they have approximately constant temperature over the day (see table in Georgios Florides and Soteris Kalogirou: Measurements of Ground Temperature at Various Depths). As for the economic loss by due to the vapor: The strategy of tanking half full doesn't save you anything - it is true that you'd loose only half as much during each tanking as only half of tank's volume of saturated gasoline vapor is pushed out by the inflowing gasoline. But you need to tank twice as often. How much do you actually loose? A general rule of thumb is that evaporation of a liquid will increase the volume by a factor of 1000 (calculate more exactly from density of liquid, molar mass, temperature/partial pressure). So assuming an empty 60 l tank still saturated with gasoline vapor. The DVPE is the vapor pressure at 38°C, which is specified in norms. E.g. for "summer blends" of gasoline, it can be 60 kPa. Normal pressure is 101.325 kPa. So at +38°C air temperature, roughly 36 ml of gasoline would be in the vapor. This is the equivalent of driving something between 250 and 1200m. Todays gas price here in Germany is 1,529 €/l, so the loss would be 5.5 €ct (if it was +38°C instead of snowing...). You could also save 5.5 €ct by getting 30 l of gasoline for 0.2 €ct/l less, i.e. buying gasoline if it is about 0.1% cheaper. I'm calculating this on 30 l, because if you manage to get a full tank of gasoline for 1 €ct/l less by not tanking when the tank is still half full, you'd save 60 €ct, i.e. 10 times as much (FYI daily differences in gas price can easily be 5 - 7 €ct/l here).
