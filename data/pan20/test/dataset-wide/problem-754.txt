Globular clusters occupy an interesting place in the spectrum of composite stellar systems. As you point out, they are highly concentrated populations of stars, and seem to lack any dark matter component, unlike more massive dwarf galaxies. Binary interactions become very important in simulating globular clusters, and interestingly enough (maybe unsurprisingly), the one example of a discovery of a planet found in a globular cluster has been around a binary star system (see: PSR B1620-26 b; this circumbinary planet was found orbiting a pulsar and a white dwarf.). This is not to say there are not other examples, however, this was the easiest for me to come across. I would be interested to know how common this situation is, and in addition, how stable it is given the potentially highly chaotic environment it lives in. These speculations don't answer your question, but I thought it interesting enough to bring up as evidence in favor of your question not being an unreasonable one to ask. From the wiki page: 

To be honest I don't really understand how quantum fluctuations of dark matter could produce such an effect. Aside from instrumental or atmospheric effects (and theoretical considerations), I honestly don't recall refraction ever coming up as an important effect. 

I would recommend MPA Garching's Gadget code for cosmological simulations of structure formation. It's primarily gravitational, but I do believe you can include gas effects as well: 

Also, to give you a rough idea of how galaxies look dynamically, here's a link to a particularly nice galaxy simulator implemented in the browser (created by Adrian Price-Whelan). 

Stars do in fact move relative to one another within galaxies of all types. The orbital period of stars in a typical spiral galaxy (at around the same distance as the Sun is from the center of the Milky Way) is on the order of hundreds of millions of years. For the Sun it's something like 230 million years (source). A particularly old person (~100 years old), will have been around long enough to see something like one-tenthousandth of 1% of the orbit of stars in this region of the galaxy! Most of these stars simply do not move much relative to us in that amount of time. The exception to this view of the motions of the stars is the Sagittarius A* (which is not a star at all, but is in fact a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way). The period of stars traveling around it are on the order of 10's of years. 

Other influences (net forces: maybe nearby massive objects, or other components of the galaxy) on the tilt of the plane of a stellar system could certainly cause a precession of its axis with time. As an example of this see the precession of a gyroscope. It would be really interesting to know the distribution of angles between the plane of the galaxy and the plane of stellar systems, though I'd bet that many of them are simply aligned with the disk itself. 

Interesting question. I would say from an energy standpoint, it almost certainly it has no effect. Of course, the extreme case is Io, one of the Galilean moons whose heat source comes from the gravitational tidal stretching as it orbits very closely to the planet Jupiter. The heat that sustains the core of the Earth, however, is left over from its formation and also comes from radioactive decay of heavy elements. The differential potential energy (and hence the tidal force) over the planet Io due to Jupiter, which is approximately 1300 times more massive than the Earth, is much larger than that of the Earth due to the moon. The relationship between force and differential potential energy is: $$ F = - \nabla U $$ At a given location on the potential energy curve, the strength of the force is determined by its steepness (derivative) at that same location. Below is a quick plot I've generated for the Earth-Moon system, where the vertical red line represents the average Earth-Moon distance over a one-year period. As you can see it doesn't appear to be very 'steep', though keep the scales of the x- and y-axes in mind. 

2) Galaxy clusters come in at around 1 Mpc (that's pronounced megaparsecs, or millions of parsecs), and are the largest bound objects in the universe. Pictured below is the galaxy cluster Abell 2218. 

As for how these clusters are generated (addressing the title of your question), large N-body simulations are run over the age of the universe from different sets of initial conditions (this is where different models and assumptions come into it). These are dark matter only simulations and involve only the force of gravity. Some people are including electromagnetic interactions in their code, but it's far from being the norm, and are really only important on small scales, i.e. - inner regions of galaxies and clusters. These simulations can contain upwards of ~10 billion dark matter particles. 

The largest non-spherical objects which are virialized (meaning essentially dynamically relaxed; not in the process of forming or collapsing) are super clusters of galaxies (here is a list of nearby super clusters). They're the most massive objects before you must begin to consider large scale structures like filaments. These objects are largely non-spherical. Most of them happen to be tri-axial ellipsoids (either footballs, frisbees, or somewhere in between) due to the nature of large scale structure formation occurring along two axes at different times. If you think tri-axial ellipsoids are just spheres squashed in certain ways (and that therefore clusters don't really count as "non-spherical"), then the answer would be filamentary structures (both the most massive, and the largest in scale). Here's an image from the Millennium Simulation to show what a super cluster would look like: 

3) The closest star to the planet Earth (not counting the sun, of course) is the star system Alpha Centauri, at a distance of just about 1.3 parsecs. While you may think that this is incredibly close (and it is by cosmological standards), it would nonetheless still take us 4.24 years to travel to it if we traveled at the speed of light. 

In other words, a blue supergiant at an average distance between stars within a globular cluster would appear to be as bright as our sun is to us! This is absolutely crazy. Depending on where it is in relation to the sun, it could effective cause two days, or potentially one day which is greater than half the time it takes your planet to rotate once. I would image that this would certainly interfere with observing in optical (and shorter wavelengths). 

@adrianmcmenamin Has the right idea here. These objects he is referring to are called Trojans, and are defined to be: 

There are certainly people who study alternative (non-General Relativistic) theories of gravity. The most popular theories have so far been: 

Here's a paper I found which talks about the index of refraction of dark matter (different from gravitational lensing) and how a signal might attenuate. The paper is entitled, "Dark Matter Constraints from a Cosmic Index of Refraction", and here is the abstract: 

No, it does not. The constellations are fixed (on time scales long enough for humans to consider as fixed, at least) patterns of stars which exist on the celestial sphere. This celestial sphere is a coordinate system which has the Earth at its center. From the Earth's perspective, the sun rises and sets at the same rate as the constellations, but as the Earth revolves around the sun, the constellation the sun will appear to be in will change. However, the constellation the sun appears to be in (if projected onto the celestial sphere), is exactly how the constellations of the Zodiac are determined. 

There are many situations which can give rise to gravitational lensing. These regimes are: Strong Lensing Strong lensing is the most visually stunning form of gravitational lensing, and as its name suggests, requires an extremely massive object, and a good deal of alignment between the lens and the source. Galaxy clusters are the most common cause of strong gravitational lensing. Partial arcs, full arcs (Einstein rings), and multiple images are all strong gravitational lensing features one can observe. Some of the most commonly studied objects producing strong gravitational lensing features are the Abell clusters, the most famous of which is Abell 1689 (image below).
