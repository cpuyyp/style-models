For problem 2 the answer is false for most spaces that one wants to consider. If $X$ is a path-connected paracompact space of non-measurable cardinality, then $X$ is a path component of the Stone-Cech compactification $\beta X$. See, for example, Theorem 3 in the paper On fundamental groups of compact Hausdorff spaces by James Keesling and Yuli Rudyak. $URL$ 

It is well known that if $\phi$ is a $\Delta_{1}$-formula and $x_{1},..,x_{n}$ in $V$ and $V[G]$ is a forcing extension, then $V\models\phi(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ if and only if $V[G]\models\phi(x_{1},...,x_{n})$. In other words, we say that $\Delta_{1}$ formulas are absolute for forcing extensions. More generally, if $\phi$ is $\Sigma_{1}$, and $V\models\phi(x_{1},...,x_{n})$, then $V[G]\models\phi(x_{1},...,x_{n})$. I am wondering about what kind of absoluteness theorems hold between $V^{B}$ and $V$. Perhaps, there are absoluteness theorems where the formulas in $V^{B}$ are slightly different than the formulas in $V$. Let me be more specific about what I mean. Let $B$ be a complete Boolean algebra and let $V^{B}$ be the corresponding $B$-valued set theoretic universe. Suppose $\dot{X}\in V^{B}$. Let $\Gamma^{*}(\dot{X})=\{\dot{x}\in V^{B}:\|\dot{x}\in\dot{X}\|=1\}$. Let $\simeq$ be the equivalence relation on $\Gamma^{*}(\dot{X})$ where $\dot{x}\simeq\dot{y}$ iff $\|\dot{x}=\dot{y}\|=1$. Let $\Gamma(\dot{X})=\Gamma^{*}(\dot{X})/\simeq$. Suppose that $n_{1},...,n_{r}$ are natural numbers and $V^{B}\models\dot{R}_{1}\subseteq\dot{X}^{n_{1}},...,\dot{R}_{k}\subseteq\dot{X}^{n_{r}}$. Let $X=\Gamma(\dot{X})$. If $1\leq i\leq r$, then let $R_{i}$ be the $n_{i}$-ary relation on $X$ where $([x_{1}],...,[x_{r}])\in R_{i}$ if and only if $V^{B}\models (x_{1},...,x_{n_{i}})\in\dot{R}_{i}$. Then for which n-th order formulas $\Phi$ do we have $V^{B}\models((\dot{X},\dot{R}_{1},...,\dot{R}_{r})\models\Phi(\dot{a}_{1},...,\dot{a}_{r}))$ implies $(X,R_{1},...,R_{n})\models\Phi$ whenever $V^{B}\models\dot{a}_{1},...,\dot{a}_{r}\in\dot{X}$? If $\Phi$ is a first order formula, then the answer to this question is fairly clear: The structure $(X,R_{1},...,R_{r})$ is a Boolean product of the structures $(\dot{X},\dot{R}_{1},...,\dot{R}_{r})/U$ where $U$ ranges over the ultrafilters on $B$. However, Horn formulas are preserved under most Boolean products [see 1] including the Boolean products that one obtains from forcing. In particular, if $\Phi$ is a Horn formula, then $V^{B}\models((\dot{X},\dot{R}_{1},...,\dot{R}_{r})\models\Phi(\dot{a}_{1},...,\dot{a}_{r}))$ implies $(X,R_{1},...,R_{n})\models\Phi([\dot{a}_{1}],...,[\dot{a}_{n}])$ whenever $V^{B}\models\dot{a}_{1},...,\dot{a}_{r}\in\dot{X}$. Furthermore, the Feferman-Vaught theorem also holds for most Boolean products [see 1], so the truth value of any formula in the structure $(X,R_{1},...,R_{n})$ is determined by the Boolean truth value of formulas in $(\dot{X},\dot{R}_{1},...,\dot{R}_{n})$. However, it is not clear which higher order formulas are preserved by going between $V$ and $V^{B}$. I however must mention that some higher order sentences are preserved when one goes from $V^{B}$ to $V$. For example, it is a well known fact about iterated forcing that if $V^{B}\models``\dot{C}\,\textrm{is a complete Boolean algebra}"$, then $V\models``\Gamma(\dot{C})\,\textrm{is a complete Boolean algebra}"$. Perhaps this result can be generalize to a large class of first order formulas that contains the second order formula stating that the object is a complete Boolean algebra. I would also appreciate it if someone supplied references for such absoluteness results. I am currently just interested in such absoluteness results between $V^{B}$ and $V$ and I am not as much interested right now in the corresponding absoluteness between $V^{B}/U$ and $V$ where $U$ is an ultrafilter. 1.

I am unsure of exactly what you are looking for, so I will post something that sounds reasonable. If $P$ is a poset, then the collection of all lower sets (and upper sets as well) forms a frame. Furthermore, every frame is a Heyting algebra, so every frame has an $\rightarrow$ operation. In a Heyting algebra, one may define an "if and only if" operation by letting $x\leftrightarrow y=(x\rightarrow y)\wedge(y\rightarrow x)$. If $P$ is a poset, then let $L$ denote the frame of all lower sets. Then $A\rightarrow B$ is the largest lower set with $(A\rightarrow B)\cap A\subseteq B$. In particular, $x\in A\rightarrow B$ if and only if $\downarrow x\cap A\subseteq B$. Thus, $x\in A\leftrightarrow B$ if and only if $\downarrow x\cap A=\downarrow x\cap B$. 

Suppose that $U$ is an ultrafilter over a set $X$. Then the only endomorphism $f:(X,U)\rightarrow(X,U)$ in the category of ultrafilters is the identity morphism. 

In particular, if $(\mathbb{R},\rho)$ is a proximity space compatible with the euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$, then every proximity map $f:(X,\delta)\rightarrow(\mathbb{R},\rho)$ is measurable. In every Lindelof proximity space where every open subspace is Lindelof, every open set is a proximally cozero set, so in a Lindelof proximity space, every open set is measurable. Also, if our proximity is induced by a metric, then every closed set is a proximally zero set, so every closed set is measurable. 

Of course, if $X$ is a completely regular space, then the collection of all zero-sets in $X$ is a zero-set structure. More generally, if $Y$ is a completely regular space and $X\subseteq Y$, then $\{Z\cap X|Z\,\textrm{is a zero set in Y}\}$ is a zero set structure on $X$ and any zero-set structure is of this form. Zero-sets structures can also be characterized as the zero sets in certain rings of functions. If $\mathcal{A}$ is a ring of functions from some set $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$ that is closed under uniform convergence, separates points, and contains all constants, then $\{f^{-1}[0]|f\in\mathcal{Z}\}$ is a zero-set structure. Conversely, if $\mathcal{Z}$ is a zero-set structure on a set $X$, then define $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{Z}}$ to be the collection of all functions $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ such that $f^{-1}[C]\in\mathcal{Z}$ for each closed set $C$. Then $\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{Z}}$ is a ring of functions closed under uniform convergence, separates points, and contains all constants and $\mathcal{Z}=\{f^{-1}[0]|f\in\mathcal{A}_{\mathcal{Z}}\}$. Zero-set structures can also be characterized in terms of proximity spaces. In fact, the notion of a zero-set structure lies somewhere between the notion of a completely regular space and a proximity space in terms of how much structure one has. If $(X,\delta)$ is a proximity space, then a set of the form $f^{-1}[\{0\}]$ for some proximity map $f:(X,\delta)\rightarrow[0,1]$ is said to be a proximally zero set. If $(X,\delta)$ is a proximity space, then the collection of all proximally zero sets forms a zero-set structures. Furthermore, if $(X,\mathcal{Z})$ is a zero-set structure, then there is a proximity $\delta$ on $X$ such that $\mathcal{Z}=\{f^{-1}[\{0\}|f:(X,\delta)\rightarrow[0,1]\,\textrm{is a proximity map}\}$. At last, in point-free topology, the structures analogous to $\sigma$-topologies are called $\sigma$-frames. A $\sigma$-frame is therefore defined to be a poset $L$ with a least and greatest element such that every finite subset of $L$ has a least upper bound, every countable subset has a least upper bound, and $x\wedge\bigvee_{n\in\omega}y_{n}=\bigvee_{n\in\omega}(x\wedge y_{n})$. One can define the notions of regularity, complete regularity, and normality not only for frames, but also for $\sigma$-frames. Furthermore, the notion of a $\sigma$-frame is quite nice since every regular $\sigma$-frame is normal and completely regular as a $\sigma$-frame. I think I have said enough, but I will end with a question that seems to be in the affirmative but which I have not researched thoroughly. $\mathbf{Question}$ Are the regular $\sigma$-frames precisely the quotients $\mathcal{Z}/\simeq$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ is some zero-set structure and $\simeq$ is some congruence on the lattice $\mathcal{Z}$ preserving countable joins?

Observe that the only elements $x\in A_{n}$ with $o_{n}(x)=2$ are of the form $x=2^{n}-2^{m}-1$ for $0\leq m<n$ and the only element $x\in A_{n}$ with $o_{n}(x)=1$ is $x=2^{n}-1$. Observe also that as $m$ grows larger there are fewer and fewer elements $x\in A_{n}$ with $o_{n}(x)=m$. The next most prominent trend in the data for $o_{n}(x)$ is that it is very rare for $o_{n}(x)=5$ or $o_{n}(x)=9$. Why is it so rare for $o_{n}(x)=5$ but it is much more common for $o_{n}(x)=6$ or $o_{n}(x)=8$? 

Let me give a fairly direct proof. Assume $R=(\mathcal{U}_{n})_{n}$ is a sequence of distinct ultrafilters on some set $X$. Since every Hausdorff space has an infinite discrete subspace, there is a subsequence $(\mathcal{V}_{n})_{n}$ of $(\mathcal{U}_{n})_{n}$ such that $\{\mathcal{V}_{n}|n\in\mathbb{N}\}$ is a discrete subspace of $\beta X$. In particular, there is a sequence $(A_{n})_{n}$ of sets with $A_{n}\in\mathcal{V}_{m}$ if and only if $m=n$. If we let $B_{n}=A_{n}\setminus(A_{0}\cup...\cup A_{n-1})$, then the sequence $(B_{n})_{n}$ is pairwise disjoint and $B_{n}\in\mathcal{V}_{m}$ iff $m=n$. If we let $B=\bigcup_{n}B_{2n}$, then $B\in\mathcal{V}_{m}$ if and only if $m$ is even. In other words, if $\mathcal{B}=\{\mathcal{V}\in\beta X|B\in\mathcal{V}\}$, then $\mathcal{B}$ is a clopen set with $\mathcal{V}_{m}\in\mathcal{B}$ iff $m$ is even. Therefore, we conclude that the sequence $(\mathcal{V}_{m})_{m}$ cannot converge to any point, so the sequence $(\mathcal{U}_{n})_{n}$ cannot converge to any point either.
