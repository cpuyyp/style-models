I've known something like this: $URL$ but I don't know this will work for casual bikes. I also agree with @reiheit, internal geared hub is much more nicer idea. An example of this is bike rental system in Taipei ($URL$ I've been in Taipei for a while, and these bikes were awesome. They had 5 speeds (If my memory is correct.). Moreover, Internally geared hub is less prone to failures, and I think the bikes require less maintenance. 

Drop bars are possible, but you need to measure the effective top tube of your frame and the "reach" of a new drop bar you want to purchase. You didn't tell what hybrid bike you have but I assume the effective top tube on your bike is longer than ones on road bikes. Another consideration is that drop bars have additional reach forward (70-80mm). There's high a possibility that you'll need a shorter stem (< 100 mm), however, the handling might be funny (Although I've never tried this). Additionally, I assume you want to be faster. have you considered to purchase slicker/narrower tires? This solution might be less hassle and way cheaper. Being in aero position is nice but tire selection is much bigger factor to get faster, IMO. 

On the other side of the steerer (stem quill) you should have a bolt (most likely with Allen recess) - unscrew this bolt slightly to the wedge (the part that resides on the thread of the bolt) moves away from the steerer. They become more aligned allowing to drive them down the head tube (actually into the fork). Then tighten the bolt making sure that the handlebars are perpendicular to the weel. The more you tighten the bolt the more the wedge gets stuck in the fork tube. To remove the quill you first unscrew the bolt and then give it a gently tap with a hammer to unseize the wedge. See the cross-section: 

Black is the BB shell, Red are the original cups (with bearing races), Green is the Miche square-taper bottom bracket cartridge. Positioning of the axle is done by placing some shims (ground to size) on left or right side. The whole setup is working correctly now for more than 1000 km. The retaining nut came lose once, in fact I've assembled everything to check my proof-of-concept and it was working so well that I forgot to tighten or thread-glue the setup. After fixing that I'm experiencing no problems whatsoever. Soon I'm going to build a daily commuter for my daughter based on Raliegh Ladies Traveller (something between the '30s and the '70s) frame (which we got for free and she really liked shape of the frame and front fork). As it is Raleigh, the bottom bracket has proprietary threading, which isn't BSC (a.k.a. BSA) - I've already checked it. 

If your goal is comfort over speed, I would emphasize in three upgrades which don't break your bank: 

The only bad thing about the app builder is the app itself is sluggish over time (something wrong with my browser?), but it's no a big deal, since you can always save a route and refresh the page. Also, If I plan a long route, I've found strava heatmap is pretty useful , although popular routes don't always have the least elevation: $URL$ 

Find a comfortable saddle. Go to your LBS and ask their opinions. A lot of people suggest leather saddles, like Brooks or Selle Anatomica. A good saddle is expensive, but it is a worth upgrade and you will be surprised how big the difference is between a cheap saddle and a good one. If you are on a tight budget, a padded short is a cheaper option. Do you use a bike rack and panniers? for a long ride especially on hot weather, a set of pannier is better than a backpack. I think your current tires are already pretty good but it might be worth a try to have wider and fatter tires for more comfortable rides. I assume your current tires are 32mm wide, so upgrade to 35mm tires. 

I'd say it depends on the length of the rack you're going to attach. It's all about the physics - the water droplets, when they detach from the tyre they move perpendicular to the perimeter of the wheel. If the rack is long enough, the droplets that might reach your back are hitting the rack (acting as a mudguard). The ideal situation would be when the rack reaches to the furthest rear point of the wheel. Then only the droplets travelling vertically are not covered by the rack. However when the rack gets shorter, the more droplets travel to the front, thus direction of your back. Short story long - have a look at the picture: 

I hope you know that in BSC threading the drive side has a reverse thread (you unscrew it clockwise). In fact I'm facing a similar problem and I'm planning on the following approach: 

I have a 46cm gravel bike with 170mm crank arms (it's a Surly Cross Check, it's approximately equivalent to a 50cm road bike ). Although it isn't a MTB, it's still a 29er (700c = 29er with narrower tires). Indeed, toe overlaps are issues for me, although they are more like annoyance. Toe overlaps mostly happen when I stop at a red light, or sudden strong braking (almost completely stop) with a sharp turn. However, when I ride the bike in trails with twisty turns, at a reasonable speed, toe overlaps have never occurred. I think toe overlaps don't affect the riding performance. At first, it's quite annoying but it's not the end of the world. After a while, I'm used to it and I don't plan to modify my bike. edit: Recently I've been trying a lot of things on my bike, here's what I can tell from my experience: 

With some pieces of inner tube it will not damage the paint job and with some isolation tape it will be almost invisible. The reasonable place for the knot is the underside of the frame so not disturbing anyhow. Here is how to use one (DIY): 

I would either use some dedicated set, like this one: Basil crate fixing set (picture comes from their webpage). Or I would fabricate something similar using 4 penny washers (on top of the basket) with 4 M4 or M5 bolts with nuts and 2 metal (aluminium) strips for under the carrier rack. Perhaps 2 bolts with penny washers and 1 metal strip along the rack would be enough. 

In both cases you need to replace considerable amount of components as both options include maintenance (replacing worn out parts). But these are the facts. Now for the numbers. With 3x7 setup you don't have 21 gears as you won't ride with chain crossed and also some of the combinations may double (it would be great if you could post your setup with exact number of cogs). In practice you may have like 10 to 12 effective gear ratios. With a 1x12 setup you have 12 gear ratios, no question about it. What you should compare, is what is the highest and the lowest gearing ratio you can obtain with your current setup and how does it compare to 1x12 setup (as 12 chainring cassettes are quite fixed, there is some play with front chainring to obtain more terrain or road gear ratios). If 1x12 setup gives you the same (or maybe broader) gear ratio range, why not go for it? You then hit two birds with one stone (more recent parts on your bike and maintenance done). Of course assuming that you will be still using this bike extensively and not overhauling it for sale (in the latter case you may not claim the money back you had spent on new parts). The only hurdle I see in switching to 11 or 12 chainring cassette is the rear hub, as you mentioned. It may require complete new wheel, which can be hard to obtain in 26" and rim brakes option. But if you can relace the wheel yourself (or have it done at reasonable costs), the problem is out of the way. Considering the bottom bracket update - I assume you have a square-taper BSC threaded setup. I would either stick to it and just look for a new crank (for one chainring) or go full-ahead and replace it with a Hollowtech or Octalink (as far as I know there are adaptor sets for BSC shells available). 

Purchase a bike pump with psi gause, so you can know precisely how much pressure the tubes have. Checking the pressure by hand isn't always the best method since I found it is hard to distinguish 30psi or 60psi on my tires. Get wider tires, for example go with 700x28mm or 700x32mm since wider tires can handle rough condition better. Some tires have kevlar protection, you can use those, but I doubt you need to purchase new tires 

Based on my experience, determining the chainline based on specifications of the components (BB and Crankset) and a simple math calculation is the best approach. This is because I was having a hard time to ballpark the chainline. I then found out that the manufacturer of the crankset I use provides a specification document which describes the recommended spindle length of the BB and the chainline measurement. To get the spacers adjustment correct, I use a table provided by Surly: surlybikes.com/files/SS_Spacer_Kit.pdf . The table isn't really specific for Surly spacers but it only works with Shimano hubs. Surly SS kits are expensive, so I recommend to purchase ones from a Taiwanese company which can be found on Ebay. 

@Criggie - your answer does fully cover the problem. I can add something from my experience, however. I'm not using the plastic or rubber rim tapes anymore, mainly because of the valve stem problems the OP is having. Instead, I'm replacing them with this adhesive rim tape (no association with Schwalbe whatsoever): 

In case the video is taken down, I'm posting a written answer. Yes, it is possible to convert from downtube shifters to brifters. Here's what you need: 

a. use a hacksaw to cut the cup flange off (sawing next to the frame) of the non-drive side b. you can also use "hot knife" (a blade heated up on the gas flame) to cut the flange off. Hot knife gives you more freedom when shaping the incision, you're almost guaranteed to remove all material that is holding BB cartridge in place. remove the spindle with the bearings (nylon cups are usually holding the cartridge bearings) gently using an utility knive to remove a section of a cup (cutting perpendicular to the thread windings) or applying the soldering iron to melt the cup thread remove the drive side using this method of RJ The Bike Guy. 

Currently, I'm little bit worried about the compatibility of my crankset and the bottom bracket. The crankset is Truvativ Isoflow, the BB is BB-UN55 (Square taper). Yesterday, after the bike hit +1400 km mark, I scheduled maintenance for the crankset. I disassemble the crank arms and the BB, cleaned them, apply grease (I use Phill Wood), and reassemble. However, when I removed the crank arms, I didn't need a crank puller at all. This made me worried that the crank arms might be loose. So what I might want is tigthen the crank bolts. However, on the drive side, the right crank arm already hit "the limit" (see an image below) so it wouldn't go any further in. To the best of my knowledge and according to this specification document, the BB should be compatible with the crankset. Its spindle width is 113mm to achieve 48.5mm chainline (The bike is a single speed), see a table on the bottomleft of the pdf document. Another solution I found on the web is not applying grease on the spindle and the crankarm holes to increase friction. This is what I did. So think the crankarms are tighter right now. So far I have no problem, no creaking noise, and I doubt the crank arms will be fall off anytime soon. However, I'm not sure whether I'll have problems in the future. edit 1: I put some more information: 

For the unbolting directions a Sheldon Brown's bottom bracket cribsheet gives some information. Unbolting the non-drive side is in almost all cases counterclockwise (seeing the lock ring I'm sure the cups aren't pressed in). You may then extract the spindle and the bearings and have a deep look through the shell to the drive side to confirm whether the thread there is reverse (unbolting is then clockwise). 

Depending on the thickness of your briefcase it may be a solution to hang it under the frame in the main triangle (if it fits there) but since you are thinking about a folding bike it is not a solution. I've seen something else couple of times - a special carrier for briefcases: 

I'm not sure how a folding bike would accommodate such a carrier as it attaches to the seat-stay and the back of the normal rear rack. 

Since brake cables don't rust, I think the problem is that the cable housing gets dirty with mud or any other substances. The grit inside your housing will increase the friction so the brakes become hard to pull. A way to solve this is to prevent dirt gets inside your housing by investing in good fenders. Moreover, they will help to make the bike cleaner after a ride. Additionally, I used to lubricate the brake cables, but I found this is unnecessary ($URL$ 

You are asking about converting inner tubes to tubeless. As far as I know, tubeless system isn't 100% puncture proof, if you get a nail on the road, it's impossible to fix right away and you need to call a taxi. For me, inner tubes are still the best options for bike commuting. I can think of several ways:
