I could find some info about it in Russian, but not in English. How is this organization known as in the English-speaking world? Google Translate says "Islamic Jihad - Jamaat Mujahideen". 

Maybe Stakhanov could be what you are looking for. Persistence: He broke mining records several times. Constent improvement: Even though his character might be mythical (probably forged by propaganda), he really improved mining techniques as an engineer, via the separation of tasks. 

Written by Ben Gurion, the first issue is also known as the Proclamation of Independence. QUESTION: Can the Official Gazette be seen online? It does not seem to be readable on the website of the Israel State Archives. 

Bookshops were certainly becoming more common in Victorian England. In fact, the entire printed world exploded in the 19th century. Most of it was concentrated in London, which by 1860 housed 812 booksellers, of whom 211 were also publishers.1 Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, was home to another 120 booksellers, with 30 also publishing. In contrast, the Universal British Directory listed only 988 booksellers for the entire country at the end of the 18th century.2 At the same time, bookstores still had a long way to go. By the outbreak of the Second World War, there was four to five thousand booksellers operating within Great Britain.3 From one perspective then, bookstores were not "common" in Victorian Britain, at least not to the same extent that they would become in the 20th century. Nonetheless, by the later 19th century bookshops had broken into the mass consumer market. Historically, books had been prohibitively costly to own. This was still true up in the early 19th century. Books were still a low volume business; booksellers did not maintain much stocks but instead treated assisting clients in acquiring specific books as a core business.3 Even subscribers to private libraries, which were touted as a cheaper format for readers, were typically from the more prosperous elements of society.4 From the middle of the century onward, however, readerships spread far and wide. While improved literacy played a part, important gains in that area were reached by the 18th century. Instead, most of the credit should go to the mass availability of low cost books.6 The Industrial Revolution was yielding dividends, and technological innovations such as better papermaking and printing techniques drastically lowered the cost of printed publications. Newspapers were the most widespread. With reduced publishing costs after the repeal of taxation on newspapers, they became affordable to even the lower class at merely a penny or two. Likewise, specialised periodicals catering to disparate tastes and demographic groups began to emerge.4 Apart from writings targeting the likes of farmers or homemakers, family friendly works such as those of Charles Dickens were also published in periodicals. These would often be read to the whole family by a literate member. Periodical literature supplemented but did not replace conventional books; indeed books became more accessible than ever. In the second half of the century, book prices fell precipitously thanks to increased competition between booksellers at the retail level.5 Decades of abortive attempts at price fixing finally broke down after 1852, and for the next few decades booksellers entered a period of intensive, unrestricted mutual undercutting. The destructive price war depressed profit margins and bankrupted many merchants, but also meant late Victorian readers could expect a substantial discount on the cover price of books. By the time retailers and publishers finally cooperated to enact the price-fixing Net Book Agreement of 1899, books were being read by far more people than ever before. 

According to Wikipedia citing Frank McLynn, Napoleon, Pimlico 1998 Ch 21, p482, strikes were forbidden by Napoleon I in exchange for a guarantee by employers that wages would remain high. How did this guarantee work? Did Napoleon actually manage to ensure that wages remained high? Did he at least act towards that goal? 

Section 411 of the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001 (8 U.S.C. § 1182) authorized the Secretary of State, in consultation with or upon the request of the Attorney General, to designate terrorist organizations for immigration purposes. This authority is known as the Terrorist Exclusion List (TEL) authority. The TEL list has not been update since 2004. Is it still used for any purpose? Has it been sort of superseded by the FTO list (which has a different definition, but is updated regularly)? 

For a militarily viable tunnel you'd need the DPRK style, and without bulldozers, dump trucks, and pneumatic drills you'd need a lot more time to complete them. Not a viable solution (taking 10 years to build your tunnel? Easier to go raid another neighbour...). 

It wasn't until the idea took root again (it had existed for a while in various civilisations, e.g. the ancient Greeks) that warfare is not to involve the civilian population if this could be avoided, that was the way to wage war. And it of course resurfaced in WW2 with the bombings of Warsaw, Rotterdam, Coventry, London, and the retaliatory bombings of German cities in reprisal. Of course those were in part attempts to knock out enemy military targets (and that includes factories producing weapons), but a lot of it was directly aimed at demoralising the civilian population and hopefully get them to pressure their leaders into surrendering. 

What are these Kottabos players holding in their left hand? It is seen in a lot of similar pictures. It is as if the player refills the kylix from it. Is it a skyphos? Any info on this? 

Extracts from Kayla Theresa Natrella's Witchcraft and Women: A Historiography of Witchcraft as Gender History mentioned in rougon's answer: Main claims: Jules Michelet: 

At that time there were tons of institutions called "Notre Dame", so it is pretty hard to find. According to French Wikipedia, first communion was at age 7-8 in 1910. Not sure about before, but that might be from a école élémentaire (or the equivalent at that time). Your best bet is to find similar anchors in this list of city blasons, and check whether each city had a "Notre Dame" school. The city of Berck has a anchor in its blason, and has a school+college named Notre Dame. There might be others. 

England The city of Bristol was the hub of English expeditions into the Atlantic. Several voyages were launched from her harbours, the second largest in England, around the time of Columbus. Bristol's mariners were inspired by the legendary phantom island of Brasil, which is said to lie off the western coast of Ireland(1). There is some evidence[2] that at least some attempts did reach Newfoundland, but many voyages were indeed failures. The Itineraria Symonis Simeonis et Willelmi de Worcestre recorded an early (supposedly) failed attempt by the author William Botoner's brother-in-law, John Jay: 

Russia's list of designated terrorist organizations contains a list of names that are easily identifiable, except this one that I can't identify: 

The referenced page which states that Napoleon required a guarantee from employers that workers wages would remain high. It merely says that "[Napoleon's] police sometimes prevented employers from lowering wages as part of a carefully calculated balancing act". Also, it can be imagined that wars caused a labor shortage which raised wages. (based entirely on comments from Clint and Steve) 

I have heard that blue identified with Saint Martin, and red with Saint Denis, but the Wikipedia pages of these two saints do not mention these colours, so I have doubts. 

It's important to remember that there has been plenty of deadly plagues in Europe but only one Renaissance. The Plagues of Justinian or Antonine both caused a level of depopulation similar to the late medieval Black Deaths. So while the latter may have been a contributory factor to Renaissance, it is not a direct or causal relationship. 

Given their long tradition as national symbols, this seems quite plausible as an explanation for the Parisian livery colours. Charles VII later adopted the more familiarly coloured cornette blanche. 

Both spouses married late in Europe during the Early Middle Ages. Citing Carolingian survey data, the late David Herlihy argues[1] that prior to 1000 or so, barbarian marriage customs - marrying in late twenties to similarly aged spouse - predominated in Western Europe. From about A.D. 1,000, however, the value of women appears to have declined. Rather than receiving a bridal price from the husband, families now paid dowries to unload daughters much earlier. The age of first marriage for women thus plummeted to their late teens, but largely left that of men unaffected. For reasons that remain unclear, the situation began to be reversed at some point during the High and Late Middle Ages. This gave rise to the curious nuptial phenomenon known as the northwestern European pattern, which has dominated Western Civilisation to this date. Proposed in his highly influential 1965 work[2] by John Hajnal, this paints a picture where both spouses married late and established their own households, independent of their parents. Another feature is that significant proportions of both men and women abstained from marriage completely. Under Hajnal's classification, this system prevailed west of an imaginary line running from Trieste to St Petersburg. Hajnal's pattern is sometimes thought to originate from the value of retaining a daughter's labour on Late Medieval farms of Western Europe. Later on, the habit of young women and men to work in other households also delayed marriages. This contrasts with the Mediterranean situation, where domestic servants were more likely to be married and widowed. Other arguments propose that the need for financial security (due to the habit of relocating away from home upon marriage) forced delays. 

South Georgia was invaded in early March, on the 19th the British noticed an Argentine flag flying over the islands, well away from their own scientific station there. The Argentinians had landed armed forces disguised as scrap metal dealers on the islands. The next day HMS Endurance, embarking part of the Royal Marine detachment to the Falklands, sailed from Port Stanley to confront the Argentine landing force at South Georgia. On the 24th Endurance reached South Georgia, but was ordered to reinforce the British outpost there rather than sail around the island to the Argentine camp, possibly because of uncertainty about Argentine strength in the area. This was fortuitious, as that same day the Argentinians landed another roughly 100 troops on the island (Endurance carried only 20 Marines and was itself only lightly armed, more a police vessel than a warship).
