I've read people say it's fueled by small rewards. You get a little chemical 'hit' from smoking a cigarette or taking a drug; or from winning on a slot machine; similarly you get a little (mental) reward when you get a 'Like' or a reply on social media. And Stack Exchange for example encourages people to "pay it forward" (e.g. if you're helped by someone's answer, you're invited to try to help someone else by contributing another answer elsewhere), which (the feeling of altruism) is some kind of reward in itself. See also "operant conditioning". As for effect, it is time-consuming; and (like other addictions) can or will fragment attention. It also results in social bubbles (less connected with "real" people around you). People have a similar problem with smart phones and email/messages (the thought occurs, "let's check my phone to see if there's another message"); or with Twitter and news sites ("has anyone posted anything new?"). It's easy (relatively effortless) to do (it's easy to read a web page, for example) so I'm inclined to do it instead of doing something more difficult (e.g. work): "It's time to start work now ... I'll just read a bit of social media first, which is easier, to get started ... maybe I'll feel like working after I do that." IMO a task's being effortless is interpreted by the brain as a type of reward, something to seek (perhaps it's associated with mastery). It's unsatisfying though (or only temporarily satisfying), hence the eventual desire to repeat the "rewarding" behaviour. What are the best ways to deal with this addictive medium? Sometimes if I get too disgusted by how much time I spend on a site, I block it from my computer so that I cannot access it anymore.1 It may be good (or better) to find alternative media for communication: 'phoning people, writing letters, reading books, meeting people in person. And perhaps alternative "reward" systems (other activities that are rewarding in some way). On the subject of "best ways", it might a topic to apply the noble eightfold way to (starting with right view, and so on). 

You specified pali-canon but I think (admitting I'm merely skimming translations) that definitions of envy are similar in Mahanaya texts too; for example one of the Tibetan texts, A Necklace for Those of Clear Awareness Clearly Revealing the Modes of Minds and Mental Factors, defines it as, 

Also FYI, here's a different article which may give some background information or insight into the prescriptions of Tibetan doctors: Medical advice from the Dalai Lama's doctor. 

... in other words you ask yourself, how is it that this person who I admire has attained that admirable state? So in the sutta I quoted, for example, the thought-train includes understanding how the other person did it ("through the ending of the fermentations") and thus sees what needs to be done in order to be successful. 

It is the opposite of avijjā in SN 35.80 though. Also ñāṇa, by the way, is defined as "knowledge, understanding, wisdom, insight, conviction, recognition". Conversely I think that moha is what you have when you don't have vijjā or ñāṇa. It's used in the context of "three fires" i.e. "greed", "hatred", and "delusion" -- see also Three poisons -- which are also called the three unwholesome or unskillful roots, akusala-mūla, in AN 3.69 Of these three ("greed", "hatred", and "delusion"), "delusion" is said to be the root: so perhaps it's the cause (or condition) of "greed" and "hatred", and/or whatever "greed" and "hatred" have in common? So, I don't know; I assume, given the noble truths, that (moha) might be synonymous with craving, attachment, or something like that. But if it's the "root" then maybe it's related to other concepts too -- whatever it is you have when you don't mindfulness, for example. 

So 15 seconds per cycle, 4 per minute, including a 5 second pause in each cycle. I breathe continuously on a bicycle (i.e. during aerobic exercise), and don't try to breathe continuously when I'm at rest, i.e. at rest I do expect to pause between each breath -- and not take the next breath until I feel I begin to need it. It doesn't have to be exact: if you start a breath a couple of seconds too late or too early, it doesn't matter. By breathing deeply and continuously I can slow that to 3 breaths/minute: 

ownership is arbitrary and can't be properly defined I think it has a conventional and legal (law-of-the-land) meaning; for example: 

And I think, don't you, that it probably is still widely seen as dubious -- immoral, disreputable, scandalous, creepy, even illegal -- for someone (especially an adult) to get or to seek to become sexually involved with those who are under the protection of their parents ... and ditto other people's wives or fiancées, etc. 

There is an article Arahants, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas by Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi which mentions different views of compassion within different schools of Buddhism. Its last section is titled "Breaking down old stereotypes" and says that there are two negative stereotypes: 

There is for example a chapter of the Dhammapada called Attavagga, whose verses include the word; for example: 

This book I quote sometimes for guidance on modern-day lay life, The Buddha's Teachings on Prosperity, says "avoid senseless talk" (the Pali word for which, whose meaning we should try to understand, is samphappalapa), which it categorizes as follows: 

Try to behave virtuously, do what you can, and see the virtue of/in others. Even when you want the world to be other than it is, I think it would be worse if on top of that you regretted your own past misbehaviour; conversely you may find it better if you had good relations. I think that "recollection of virtue" (including generosity) appears frequently (e.g. here), in one form or another, as something of a consolation or support. 

That's not quite right. Buddhism says that various things are not the 'self'. Saying exactly what the self is, even saying whether the self is or isn't, is something which the Buddha avoids doing: these questions about the self are among the unanswered questions. It's an interesting question but I think that Buddhism recommends that you let that question go. 

Obviously these people can, and should. I wouldn't go to the opposite extreme and say that all advice is skilful and appropriate to you, that you'll be willing to hear it and able to use it ... And maybe everything is "intellectual" in some way -- e.g. someone might tell me how to ride a bicycle; and regardless of whether they do it themselves, I'd still have to learn to actually do it myself. Sure, the Dhamma gives such, but then it's just intellectual knowledge given by a monk, but that advice has not been practised by him Perhaps that depends, on their personal history; I'd guess they've all been children at least, and had families, and been friends, and so on. Anyone made same experiences? Not the same but sometimes I have ignored well-meaning advice: and eventually felt good about the outcome, no remorse. Other times, in retrospect I should have given better consideration to advice I was offered, and not have rejected it so quickly. So I'm heir to my own kamma, I guess -- I don't think it's possible to generalise here like this (e.g. to "always" or to "never" offer or accept advice). Also, beware, rejecting advice because of who the advice comes from is an ad hominem argument. IMO, ad hominem isn't entirely wrong (it's a useful shortcut, like "don't ask for legal advice from strangers on the internet"), but it's not right either. Also maybe there is some advice, some types of advice, which you'd rather get from friends, family, and/or professionals -- when you're lay, asking for lay advice about the lay life. And I think you can say that without going too far, i.e. so far as to say that a monk shouldn't or cannot give advice. And the success or otherwise of offering advice (i.e. suggestions about a future which you haven't experienced yet) depends partly on faith -- whether or not that faith is justified isn't easy to generalise about. I think the whole "problem" starts with titles like "venerable" or the admiration of monks/nuns. Wow. So ... the whole problem, it starts there, is that so? Maybe that is a type of conceit: comparing people -- "they are better than me, because they are ordained"? The converse might sound like a 'conceit' too, though -- "my advice is better, because I'm lay". 

Beware of translations. A word like "Heart" or "World" or "Atom" has a modern meaning. When suttas are translated into modern words, they may seem to make less sense (e.g. because you don't think with what you'd now call a "heart"). Consider though that the statement probably made sense in the original time and language, and that the translation is an approximation ... it's partly up to you to try to understand what it meant originally. It's also well to recognise that there are several translators and translations, some may make more sense to you than others. 

I think that counts as Theravada: apparently the stories were compiled 5th century CE, by Buddhaghosa who is called Theravadin. Other things to note: 

I don't know about Buddhist teaching but it's reminding me of one time when my Tai Chi master pretended to attack me and I moved to block without thinking about it: so my action was aware (of what I saw) but unconscious. Similarly when driving a car: when I was a student driver I had to consciously think about everything ... changing gear, other cars, road signs, stationary objects, indicators, the driving instructor, etc. Now that I have more-or-less mastered driving it's sufficient to be aware of what I see around me, and to some extent being less conscious implies greater capacity for awareness. Maybe I developed neural circuitry to handle the sense-input-signals from driving... 

I guess there are two ways to see a duality. One was is "All or nothing" ... and that's the message I'm hearing in your question: "All liking, disliking, habits, and social associations are ... they're old, and, they're selfish, and, associated with delusion ... and this 'all' should be (or will be, is being) replaced by 'nothing' -- i.e. to lose all liking, disliking etc., along with social associations, with a tendency toward a kind of void & nihilism." A slightly different view, I think, is "unskillful versus skillful", or "delusion versus knowledge", etc. According to this doctrine you don't replace "all" with "nothing" -- instead you replace delusion with wisdom, and so on. The question i.e. ... 

I'm not sure I agree with jathin's answer. There was a case in my country a few years ago, where someone on a bus cut off someone else's head. They did that, because they thought that they were sitting next to a devil. The criminal justice trial found them "not guilty of murder by reason of diminished responsibility", they were remanded for psychiatric care, and later released (with anti-psychotic medication). I'm not sure I know about kamma but I think that intention follows from view, and if your view is psychotic (e.g. if you think you're sitting next to a devil) then I'm not sure. I slightly doubt whether Buddhism would recommend you kill even a "devil" if you meet one: but still. I think that the Vinaya (see page 74 through 86) identifies what constitutes murder: 

As dean mentioned, there is a sutta which seems to match your question. In the Brahmana Sutta: To Unnabha the Brahman, Venerable Ananda says, 

When my SO became vegetarian she said she liked animals (e.g. horses and cows and so on) and other living creatures; and said it would be hypocritical to cause them (e.g. to pay a butcher for them) to be killed for her to eat. I think she felt that being non-vegetarian (i.e. that being a carnivore or predator) would interfere with or cloud her perception of her love for living animals. 

I hope I can post this without its being considered useful practical advice. The Buddhist Monastic Code II: The Khandhaka Rules Translated and Explained says (added emphasis is mine), 

Another theory is that some (or many, or all) people only have to reattain an enlightenment which has already occurred. Another theory is that cessation happens frequently; but there's "rebirth" (of, for example, a sense-of-self etc.), and what takes a while is practice which allows those "births" to cease. 6. What if rebirth truly doesnt exist? The whole point in striving for enlightement is then pointless. Some people reckon it's important for (during) this life. 7. Most people and monks dont question every doctrine. They use it as Thanissaro Bhikkhu said as a "working hypothesis" and therefore filter out any contrary evidence. What I mean by this is that they are succumbed to an argument of authority. If I can try to think of an example, think of two different bits of doctrine: 

Sankha might be right: we might have been better to have been friends than to have "loved" each other. I'm not sure about Rabbit's answer; that answer says, "our natural state is non-discriminative love", but a typical, old-fashioned "romantic" relationship is perhaps discriminative and exclusive: it says, "I will love you and no-one else" (or, "I love you in a way that I don't love anyone else"). A famous saying about love is, "love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own." I suspect that love can cause attachment, which makes happiness more difficult, and makes your happiness less under your own control. You give your partner control over whether you feel happy: you allow them them to hurt you (and they feel hurt by you). Whether it's "possible" to have a "romantic relationship, without attachment, just based on pure love and with equanimity" presumably varies from person to person. Maybe it becomes easier as you get older and if you become wiser. Now after my friend died I still remember her. Perhaps I remember her without "attachment", i.e. without hurting myself by wishing that things are other than as they are. When I (still) dream about her, which I did last night, I feel less conflict between the dream (of her being present) and reality (her having died). I suppose the above doesn't seem like a strong recommendation. I suppose that on the plus side, if you are able to eventually (and it might take years or decades, if you're ever able to at all) overcome your many faults, it gives you an opportunity to help two people (you and your partner) to experience that love. It might matter, whether you and your partner have the same "values": whether you value the same thing. For example, do you both value "relationship without attachment" and "love with equanimity"? Buddhism? If so perhaps that's a friendship, a community. If not, an unequal or one-sided relationship. 

The above are small time scales (e.g. one second, more or less). The general statement might be also true (be meaningful/applicable) over much longer time-scales: if e.g. pain hurts today I might worry that it will get worse tomorrow, or next year; or maybe it doesn't hurt much today but I remember it used to hurt. 

My initial (school) training is more-or-less as a Physicist. My opinion is that every time I see people try to relate Buddhism to Physics, they're wrong (i.e. confused) -- but people do try, you can see it sometimes on this site, trying to relate Buddhism to Einstein's relativity, or to quantum mechanics. Anyway I think that in general Buddhism describes human perception and psychology (how we feel about the world, how we think, subjective), and sociology (ethics in society), and philosophy (what "good" is, and which are the better "views") ... none of which is in the domain of Physics. So, I assume that the Agañña Sutta (if it's worth considering at all) is saying something about Buddhism, about human experience (psychological being), and not about Physics (form, astronomy, geology, species etc.). For example maybe the sutta is about the experiences of a single human, and the "long lifetime" at the beginning might be some memory of how the days seemed long when you were young, or something like that. Anyway, have you read the Agañña Sutta? Does it read to you like a story that you're meant to take literally? Being from a non-Buddhist background I'm accustomed to reading stories, which aren't meant to be literally true, but which are meant to convey a lesson; including: 

The term is vague and (perhaps except in academic history of religion usage) pejorative. See Cult for a partial list of organizations/adjectives associated with the word 'cult': 

Due to the above wrong view , do you agree that Physicists are suffering or going to suffer? IMO physicists suffer for the same reasons as other people -- it's not exactly because of physics (scientific theories) that they suffer. Their knowledge of physics doesn't contribute to their suffering -- like (I guess) neither does a farmer's knowledge of agriculture, nor a linguist's knowledge of grammar, etc. But physics doesn't address (explain) the cause of human suffering, and so it doesn't offer much solution IMO. For that reason a suffering physicist may find physics unsatisfactory, and appreciate the Dhamma for its insights into phenomena (e.g. feelings) which are outside the scope of physics. Is one good thing about physics, that it might be a preliminary training in emptiness?
