Can't answer for FAA, only the Australian system through CASA. But the US and Australia are both ICAO members, and so pretty similar. Air Law would be a requirement. Not knowing the law will not work as an excuse when the dragon gets Airforce One diverted due to an airspace incursion. Meteorology would only really apply because if the dragon decided to fly into a hurricane, the FAA would be liable to litigation due to not exercising proper duty of care. By making the dragon pass a meteorology exam, they would have satisfied that duty of care, and the rest is up to the dragon. Human Performance and Limitations: What can I say? they'd have to reword that. Aerodynamics: The dragon would probably get away without it, although might need to explain wake turbulence and proper separation behind departing aircraft (if airport takeoffs and landings applied). Aircraft Systems: Probably a medical examination by a designated aviation medical examiner would be good enough. Navigation: A must have. Your dragon needs to know where it is going, especially without using navaids or GPS. Limited to VFR, so must stay under 10,000 feet (I'm assuming that the dragon does not carry supplemental oxygen on board to fly above 10,000 feet. Oxygen + fire breath = bad news). All in all, it's not so much about the dragon's ability to fly, it's more about the dragon's ability to fly in crowded airspace where it could get messy if/when the dragon flew into the path of a 747/C172/F-22/skydiver/sailplane. Ground operation of fire breath: Along the lines of Australian Civil Aviation Orders CAO 20.9 (See part 6). 

An example, at least in terms of the mechanics involved, is the moon. Tidal locking explains this. If you looked at Earth as a star instead of a planet, the moon would always have one side heated, and the other side cooled, as it has one side facing and the other side facing away at all times during its orbit. A night and a day side, with a temperature gradient from one to the other. For an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sol-like sun, the nature of the day/night hemispheres of the planet would depend on how far away it was from the sun. The closer it is to the sun, the larger the heated day side would be, and through atmospheric convection forces, the hotter the night side would be too. At a Goldilocks distance away from the sun (not too hot, not too cold, just right), you'd end up with a band around the planet as a tangent to the orbit, separating the two hemispheres. The temperature within this band could be suitable for life. The hemisphere closer to the sun would be too hot, cooling as it approaches the band. The hemisphere away from the sun would be too cold. So you'd have a permanent day side which is within the temperature gradient suitable for life, and part of a night side which is also suitable for life. Hugh Howey in one of his Molly Fyde books (The Bern Saga series) has a scenario much like this. Half of the world is scorched, the other half frozen. With habitation in a narrow band. Actually, from memory the world in the story had two suns. But the principle would work with only one sun. 

Kassam-type rockets (simplified version of Soviet Grad MLRS rocket) especially if you can also master real explosives for warhead (like dynamite). They already can be produced with access to very low-tech equipment and should be doable in middle age workshop. Would change warfare pretty quickly: no massive charge of cavalry, walls of no use, naval warfare would change fast, etc. 

As we are talking Medieval level of technology, I assume you need time for keeping calendars, as timekeeping on the scale of hours/minutes could be easily done using clepsydrae. Also, I understand you mean "solar day" lasts ~9 years, not "rotation period", i.e. time planet rotates around its axis (See wikipedia article on Venus for the example of extreme difference between two). Now, because of this peculiar geography I assume you have a need to know the time of "rotational day" for calendars and historical records. Achieving this would be relatively easy if planet has magnetic field with magnetic poles not coinciding with geographical poles, as the angle between magnetic north and true north will depend on geographical location. As your people move with solar day, the year for them will end when magnetic pole will point to true north. 

What you likely need, is a world with iron ore not being abundant or not being within easy reach. There are several ways for this to happen: 1) very prehistoric civilization (more then several million years ago) depleted most easily recoverable iron ore deposits 2) due to peculiar geology, no young mountains on land, or the rest of land was recently (in geological terms) under shallow seas and to reach iron ore deposits you must go down more than a mile, etc. So if the only iron you can get is low quality bog iron, and even that is sparse you'll get the world you want without redesigning laws of physics. 

In Russian empire convicts were sent to Siberia for permanent settlement, as punishment and a way to identify them, those who commited grievous crimes (quite a wide definition at that time), would often have been cropped ( their ears cut off), and/or have their nostrils teared. Branding face (usually forehead) with hot iron was also common. Cutting off limbs was much less common, as made inmate unfit for forced labour. Provided authorities with difficult to hide way to identify prisoners. 

I'm convinced there is a good, physical solution to your problem: If your people are giants, it solves most (all?) identified issues. 1) For giants of sufficient size, truly effective melee weapons would be extremely hard to come by. Larger bodies encounter physical limits on blood pressure/vasculature that make it impossible to accelerate a heavy, bulky melee weapon quickly. So contrary to much existing giant lore, real giants could not kill each other in skilled combat simply by swinging trees around or by incorporating giant boulders into hand-to-hand techniques -- this is simply incompatible with anatomy and physics. 2) Therefore, for real melee dominance, a sword would be required -- yet not just any sword. A razor-sharp and long yet incredibly strong blade would not even be sufficient. You'd also need lightweight, space-age materials to ensure that the blade could be accelerated by large giants up to hand-to-hand combat speeds, using the same kinetic chain motions (hip -> shoulder -> elbow -> wrist) common to golf and tennis swings. Only then, with 20th-21st century technology, would a truly effective close quarters weapon dominate over the putatively traditional wrestling-style combat techniques. Well, but for one major exception... 3) Enter guns: As soon as primitive metallurgy is developed, the resulting heavy materials are no better than fists for the slow, lumbering grip/takedown based wrestling presumably dominating pitched combat encounters between members of the giant species. A massive hunk of metal is even worse for this purpose than the near-useless tree or boulder; small metal spears/atlatls simply can't be accelerated quickly enough to develop primitive ranged weapons, only brass knuckles gain any popularity. But with only a little further technological development, guns quickly become the common soldier's weapon. Finally, the physical constraints on the giant's body are sidestepped via the chemistry of explosives. Giants can carry handcannons to devastating effect. 4) Yet the space-age technology that eventually makes truly effective giant swords a reality has a clear upper hand over the older, widespread giant-sized guns. To propel a projectile large enough to kill a giant, and with the gun's chamber being subject to quadratic forces, the chamber must be reinforced to a proportionally much greater degree than the small guns we know. This means they are extremely heavy, even for giants. They can't be aimed quickly, so there is no giant equivalent of the carbine or assault rifle. A futuristic, strong/lightweight/long blade in the hand of a well-trained king/queen would allow them to waltz into a room full of armed guards and summarily dispense cold justice before the guards had properly trained their sights (remember, in close quarters guns need not only to pivot/rotate, but also to translate so that the chamber can properly align with a moving point-blank target -- easier said than done when your gun is a 3000 lb chunk of metal). 5) Worth noting: It's possible that in a world with much higher gravity than Earth, normal human sized people would face these same physical constraints that giants would on Earth. Though it's difficult to deeply extrapolate how an extreme gravity condition might have impacted the evolution of life. But such a factor is much more easily handwaved away than lots of the showstopping issues so elaborately discussed in other answers. 

Another issue would be the Hydrogen Sulphide gas (H2S) that is common around volcanic events. For one thing, H2S is an explosive gas. No lights in the castle after dark. No cooking fires, although you've got plenty of lava to cook your food for you. Another thing is that H2S smells bad. It's often referred to as 'rotten egg gas'. You can start to smell it at less than 1 part per million (ppm). That's only a minor problem though. It is also a toxic gas. The 'Short Term Exposure Limit' for H2S is 15 ppm. The smell would cease to bother you after about 100 ppm, as it basically kills your olfactory nerves, permanently ruining your sense of smell. At about 300 ppm, you are pretty much on your way to death, if not dead already. H2S is heavier than air, so it would settle in the lowest parts of the castle. Dungeons and areas enclosed by the wall, rooms on lower floors etc. Nasty stuff. I don't think I'd want to live in that castle. 

For a science fiction novel I'm currently writing... The spacecraft in question is based in the asteroid belt and is not designed to approach a planet. The ship has an offensive/defensive capability and would need to be able to manoeuvre effectively in combat. The timeframe is within the next two hundred years. Additionally, it would need to be able to refuel easily within the asteroid belt. With this in mind, I aim to equip the ship with magnetoplasmadynamic ion drives. My understanding is that they can operate using a hydrogen or ammonia fuel, which should be easily replenishable in the asteroid belt, and would be powered by a nuclear power source. But an MPD ion drive does not produce much acceleration. My question: What kind of drive might I use to provide rapid acceleration (in combination with an MPD drive) for combat situations, or to evade an enemy? Ideally using hydrogen as a fuel (or something else obtainable in the asteroid belt without needing much refinement) and powered by electricity. I know that chemical engines would be able to produce the acceleration, but use lots of fuel. If I need to use them, I will. But an alternative would be very welcome. I don't have much of a background in science, but would like to accurately portray the drive system of the ship (in broad brush strokes at least). By all means, comments on MPD drives are welcome too. 

1) As part of enforcing self-identity and the fact they belong to different groups: career criminals almost universally develop their own language, best known example to me is "fenya" -- made up language in Russian prisons. 2) The large area taken by each race -- sheer distance plus relatively slow means of travel even in case of lack of natural barriers helps to develop dialects and subsequently languages 3) the fact that different parts of one race's territory borders different cultures: this differential influence can speed up development of regional dialects and move the language farther from it's common ancestor 

In short, yes, availability of some kind of valuable mineral resource is enough to build city in inhospitable remote place. The resource does not have to be particularly precious : if its extraction generates profit even after extra cost imposed by geography, it is enough. As an example, please consider Russian city of Norilsk: it is located in place that is probably closest thing to Antarctic desert and without the bonus of geothermal heat! Primarily they extract nickel or, but also some precious satellite metals as well. $URL$ 

Actually, cleaning of cesspits and latrines was a well rewarded, if not we'll respected job since Medieval times to 19 century, you might want to consult this article: $URL$ Up to 19 century many houses in Europe had cesspool in basement, sometimes it caused wooden beams to rot and floor to collapse, as in the case of Emperor Frederik I in 1183, when he and his guests fell 39 feet down into cesspool in Erfurt Castle. 

Before getting to technicalities (branch of knowledge, skills worth preserving) you need a highly self-organised self-governing group of people with a sense of mission that could do the job. Most likely they would be followers of religion that gives you sense of living and death, gives meaning to your suffering and strength to not be fearful of death and allows for a rise of some kind of warrior code (maybe among caste/clan of warriors). They would have a developed law system (not necessarily a complex one, but strictly adhered to), that will satisfy the need for justice and would be envyed by outsiders. In post-apocalyptic world they would appear most likely first as followers of some highly revered figure, maybe considered prophet. This group must also be self-perpetuating, either through recruiting new members, or natural growth. Preserving knowledge MUST be essential to its stated purpose: rebuilding God's Kingdom, or whatever purpose you give them. If the group considers knowledge evil and root of problems, they won't try to preserve it. Examples: early Church communities, highland clans (these are less likely to be concerned about knowledge preservation), Jewish people throughout most of their history, etc. Once you have your group and where it exists (decaying cities, as early Church in late Roman Empire; group of highly protected sheltered compounds in srarcely populated areas, what would likely be a feature of some reclusive Christian denominations in US) it can be easier to determine what kind of knowledge they need, as it is highly unlikely they could or will attempt to preserve all knowledge.
