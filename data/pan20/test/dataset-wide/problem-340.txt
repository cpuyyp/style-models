The Aeolipile has steam running through nozzles to set it spinning which wastes energy because the steam still expands once it exits the system which is wasted work. Additionally, you are limited on how fast the system can spin due to drag. Higher pressure will allow the system to spin faster but at the cost of wasting more energy in the expanding steam and greater drag because the force of drag goes up with speed. 

Effectively all out nuclear war in space a century from now, here is how it plays out. The Weapons Improving the weapons means we have upped the killitivity coefficient by switching to purely fusion driven weapons, maybe a miniaturized Z-machine to light fusion of hydrogen. How really doesn't matter, the fact is they are fusion weapons and will likely even have a dialable yield. So the world leaders will go for broke and turn that dial to 11 so the maximum yield may very well be multiples of the Tzar Bomb. Which actually will have little effect on the EMP production because you can only ionize the ionosphere so much, according to my EM professor 100kt or 1Mt makes little difference. On Earth As stated, massive global HEMP's could be disastrous in its own right for sure. But the world of 2100 is a little different than our own. Computers have gotten smaller and are thus more susceptible to electronic noise so they are also better shielded and have greater redundancy built in, as a result, may fair better in an EMP. Also, (hopefully) advancements in nanotech would allow for SOC devices to have their own repair mechanisms and/or naturally resilient circuits. For larger infrastructure we may have gotten around to actually protecting against Solar Storms which will serve to protect from the E3 Pulse. Additionally, seeing that it is somewhat of a troublesome time it's fair to assume that EMP resistant infrastructure may be mandated. So it may very well be reasonable to assume that the EMP's would not do much damage. Purely fusion weapons would have little to no fallout, unless they were designed to. At the altitude stated little radiation from the blasts, if any at all, would make it to the ground because of the atmosphere. Without knowing the yields of the weapons other effects may include: blindness, extreme weather from localized heating (which at the altitude stated would take enormous weapons or high concentrations of detonations). In Space All satellites/space stations in LEO are probably toast as a direct result of the blast effects. Stations with polar orbits may fair better, but if the actual engagement is occurring in LEO that's a very bad place to be. As a result of the distance and improvements in EMP resistance things in higher orbits should actually be okay during the nuclear strikes. After the action the Van Allen Belts (especially the inner) would see an enormous increse in radioactivity because the fusion bombs liberate plenty of particles. Things/people not extra rad hard would not do well against that. There is also what is left of the fleet itself; presumably many thousands, if not millions, of tons of vaporized ship that would be blasted into all kinds of orbits. Effectively sand blasting anything it encounters. It would also help deorbit things by increasing drag and probably interfere with radio signals between earth and space. For items not vaporized, you now have hyper velocity shrapnel to deal with and of course, the remaining wreckage of the ships. Summary Most people on Earth, probably okay. LEO will be hazardous for years and require extensive clean up before it is safe. Beautiful night skyies because of nuclear detonations, auroras, and falling spacecraft. 

Technically those do exist, they are called Type II Supernova, though the endothermic part is very brief and then followed by a very exothermic reaction. The exothermic nuclear reaction is what make a star a star. Once the nuclear reaction starts taking more energy than it gives off, like when attempting to fuse iron in large stars, it collapses in on itself. Stars are held up by radiation pressure from the nuclear fusion, without it they cease to be stars. Otherwise, A star is by its very nature an exothermic reaction. Edit Has mass but does not warm a object around it. You could orbit a black hole that does not have an accretion disk. The cooling would come from space itself and for all practical purposes the black hole would give off very little heat. 

Method #1: Laser Give the energy a path to follow, a laser can create a channel of inoized air that the electricity could travel down. Essentially creating a plasma conductor between the cloud and the ground (target). Method #2: Charged Particles A stream of high-energy particles may have the same effect as the laser. Cosmic Rays may serve as the trigger for natural lighting so it's possible artificial streams of charged particles may do the same. 

A General Intelligence Appears It winks into existence (Quantum variation spawns one/ Extraterrestrial intelligence places it there for fun/ You bought the wrong magic seeds) and it has limited capacity to construct things out of organic matter. Its mission is simple: become the dominant entity on the planet. Listening to the local electromagnetic waves it learns that the dominant species on earth is humanity. Being only a general intelligence and not a super intelligence it decides to simply emulate humanity rather than try to come up with something better. After all, they had been pretty successful despite taking thousands of years to get there. It decides to build itself a few humans to start the process, small to be more efficient on resources (there is organic matter everywhere!). This decision takes .0001 seconds. As a general intelligence with a wifi connection, your knowledge of the sciences is enormous but your capacity to carry it out is not. With your constructed miniature humans you begin to build, gathering resources that you need to expand. First starting with stone to build rudimentary structures to house your miniature humans (darn things need to rest and be protected from the weather). With your computer mind and access to the wealth of humanity's knowledge advancement comes as quickly as you can gather the resources. Fire was a no-brainer "discovered" in seconds, but things got off the ground when a rusty nail was found and you could make metal tools. The discovery of an ax head relly set things in motion because you could not build a working steam engine without all the steel it contained! You make it to the industrial revolution in a matter of hours, a feat that took regular humans thousands of years. The process continues.... 

An Aeolipile is Very Inefficient In addition to what Will said about manufacturing difficulties, such devices are not used in modern times because it can't compete with the power generation capabilities of a turbine. Both operate using the Rankine cycle which entails heating a working fluid (water) into steam, having it do work (turning a generator), cooling the fluid and re-pressurizing then repeating the process. The Aeolipile wasn't exactly a closed system, but it operated in a similar fashion. A turbine has fins along its length that are optimized to extract as much energy as possible from the steam as it expands through the system. Turbines can also operate at extremely high pressures which increase output. 

If you want some realism you could handwave something involving Computronium as being able to overcome the binding problem. It is a substance that could imitate the neural networks that our brains are built upon. 

Long range communication in something the size of a cellphone is hard. The biggest issue is the power required to transmit further distances. Sorta long distance Cellphone on their own have a range of up to 45 miles, assuming ideal conditions, which is the upper limit commercial walkie-talkies of similar size. You could extend this range by using directional antennas to point towards whoever you want to communicate to. Distance Can always be increased bu adding more power, bigger antenna. Software ought to be able to let two cellphone communicate directly with one another. Longerish Distance Individual cell phones could be programmed to behave like cell towers, with the messages relayed between them. I imagine the data rate would be very low, but as long as the cell phones care within contact of each other messages could be relayed pretty far. Also, this comes with a heavy battery drain. 

Probably It would not be very practical, you could have a weapon with 2 different bolt carrier group that could be moved into place like the cylinders in a revolver. Each could accommodate a different length ammunition. The drawback is the weapon may not cycle properly when switching to the lower power pistol rounds if gas or spring operated. Another drawback is the weapon becomes more complex. 

Speed Not Required Give your sword a hydrophobic coating and it will never get any blood on it. The coating repels liquids, causing them to bead up like water on a lotus leaf and just run off. Bonus it stays nice and clean. Edit: A blade made of steel does not mean that It cannot have a coating that makes it repel blood. Furthermore, the surface geometry of the blade may be altered to give the steel hydrophobic proeprties. This laser can do it to a variety of metals. 

Storage rings in red, accelerators in green, arrows denot direction of movement. As the process continues there is more and more time between shots for the system to cool, and the magnetic fields built up to accept higher and higher energy particles. At this point the particles aren't getting faster they are getting heavier and it's harder to contain them. The Efficiency of the system is also being affected but you are keeping track of it though heat loss and the careful measurement of particles in the storage rings. After surpassing the energy that the LHC operates at (Cern should have hired me!) by several orders of magnitude and approaching the energy of the Oh My God Particle something strange begins to happen. The energy added the particles after each firing begins to drop off, no longer following the steady exponential decreases due to efficiency losses. After checking and re-checking the losses due to radiation and heat don't account for the discrepancy. Also, your particles in the storage rings are somehow losing energy, at least more than can be accounted for by losses in the system. Your scientist (probably mad scientist at this point) continues to add energy to the particles, surpassing even the highest energy cosmic rays. Now it gets weird. After a trip through the accelerator, the particles gained no more energy. In fact, the measurements indicate that there are now fewer particles all with much less energy. After careful review of data, there is no known way to account for the loss of energy and mass. The particles are once again accelerated, and this time fired into the target. The blast of radiation is enormous, lethal to anyone that is not hiding being meters of lead. Exotic particles, antimatter, you name it, are detected. Your local cosmic ray detector registers an interesting event. Scientists at LIGO register an anomaly that they can't explain. Even More Hand Waving So great was the energy of the reaction that it had begun interacting with quantum foam. At this scale, the particles had excited extra dimensions that have been compacted, one of the implications of string theory being true. For some reason, the energy required to expand this compact dimension had been low nad decreased as it expanded. This resulted in baseball sized metastable space-time anomaly that was really a gateway into a higher dimension, one where time is a location. With some more handwaving, the scientist figures out how to use it to travel between two points in time. Warning: I'm well aware this is a bunch of hand-waving, Don't judge me. This may also create a new universe. 

It actually may not be that sci-fi at all: lubricating the fault line could mitigate the situation by allowing easy movement of the faults rather than the snapping action that traditionally produces earthquakes. More explanation for clarity Earthquakes are the result of pent-up stresses in within the crust of the Earth (technically the interactions at plate boundaries but I'll get to that in a second) suddenly gets released. Generally speaking, the tectonic plates of the Earth are constantly in motion but this motion gets hung up at the plate boundaries due to friction between the plates. Over time this stoppage allows enormous amounts energy to become stored in the deformations of the rocks. You get an earthquake when this pent up stress overcomes the friction binding up the system. The crust of the earth springs back producing the earthquake. The key here is the plates of the earth bind up due to friction between them allowing all this energy to build which inevitably leads to an earthquake. So if you could somehow prevent this stress from building or limiting the magnitude that builds before the slippage, then you can stop or reduce the destructiveness of an earthquake. For example, lubricating it, quite literally putting something between the plates to make them slip past one another more easily. My link references water acting as lubricant, but I've seen ideas of using oils or even nanomachines to facilitate the movement. 

If we want to go with the plasma toroid idea in the video, you could get away with confining the plasma is a Bessel Beam. It's a laser with a target-shaped cross section, unlike a circular one of a regular laser, wherein between the concentric circles there is no laser energy. A laser in such a configuration could ionize a channel of air that the plasma could travel though. As a bonus the ionized channels could behave like the rails of a rail gun and use the Lorenz Force to accelerate the plasma to the target. 

Probably Not Firstly, a planet that forms via the accretion in a stellar nebula disk is going to form our of the material is present in the disk. To get a core super rich in tungsten there obviously needs to be a bunch of tungsten in the disk. This is an issue because all elements heavier than Iron are formed in Type II Super Nova explosions. Fusion of elements heavier than iron produces no net energy. So when larger stars start fusing Iron, after going through all the elements up to it, they collapse because there is no longer sufficient radiation pressure to hold up the star. This collapse forces fusion to create all the elements heavier than Iron. This process is messy, that means If you got enough tungsten out of such a supernova to make a planetary core, then there is a whole bunch of other elements ahead of tungsten that were made. And after too for that matter. This means that during its accretion the planet would likely not have picked up enough carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and phosphorus to support life because it formed in a very metal rich part of the cloud. The lighter elements would have been blasted further than the heavier ones, adding more difficulty to accreting them. Forming in such a matter means it probably will miss out on getting an atmosphere that even remotely resembles earth (or early earth). So natively, it will probably be unable to support life. Terraformable, yes but supporting life outright no. Also, there is the supernova remnant to consider with is either a neutron star or black hole. If this planet is still gravitationally bound to the object, it may be subjected to dangerous levels of high energy particles.
