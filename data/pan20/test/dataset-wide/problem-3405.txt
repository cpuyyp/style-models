The typical dynamic consumption-saving under certainty model can be written as: $$ \max V(c)=\sum_{t=1}^{T} \beta^{t-1}\; u(c_t) $$ Subject to the intertemporal budget constraint $$ \sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{y_t}{1+r}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{c_t}{1+r} $$ Where $T\leq \infty$ (finite or infinite horizon), $\beta \in (0,1)$ is the subjective discount factor, $y_t$ is the individual's income and $c_t$ is the individual's consumption in every time period. Finally, $u(\cdot)$ is the agent's subutility function, with $u^{\prime}>0$ whose concavity is usually related to the agent's preference for consumption smoothing. The argument is equivalent to the one justifying that an individual will reveal risk aversion iff his utility function over wealth is strictly concave. The argument that leads to consumption smoothing is the following: The first order condition for the problem is the well known Euler equation $$ \frac{u^{\prime}(c_t)}{u^{\prime}(c_{t+1})}=\beta \; (1+r) $$ It is assumed that $\beta^{-1}=(1+r)$ so that $$ u^{\prime}(c_t)=u^{\prime}(c_{t+1}) \quad \Rightarrow \text{by strict concavity of} \; u \quad c_t=c_{t+1} $$ I have two questions regarding this argument which are somehow related: 

They both want to express that the co-domain of the choice correspondence must include all the non-empty subsets of the power set of X, i.e from any menu of options, you must choose something. My question is, which one is the correct way to define it? Clearly, since $\emptyset \neq \{\emptyset\}$, both definitions cannot be equivalent. My intuition would tell me that from the list above, (1) is the correct one. For example, if $X=\{\text{pasta (p)}, \text{chicken (c)}, \text{sushi (s)}\}$, then the power set of $X$ is: $$ 2^{X}=\Bigg\{\emptyset, \{p \}, \ \{c \}, \{s \}, \{p,c \}, \{p,s \} , \{c,s \}, \{ p,c, s\} \Bigg\} $$ Since I want to “take out” the empty set from $2^{X}$ so that the choice from any non-empty subset of $X$ is itself non-empty, and since $\{\emptyset\} \notin 2^{X}$, it should be $$ c:\mathcal{A} \rightarrow 2^{X}\backslash \emptyset $$ Thank you for any answers! 

Transformation of objective function I tried to somehow transform the objective function into a common functional. Can someone confirm the following: \begin{align} &1 + \int^T_0{-re^{-rt}dt} = 1 + \left[e^{-rt}\right]^T_0 = 1 + e^{-rT} - e^0 = e^{-rT}\\ & x(0) - \int^T_0{u(t)dt} = x(0) + \int^T_0{\dot x(t) dt} = x(T)\\ \Longrightarrow \qquad& e^{-rT} x(0) + \int^T_0{e^{-rt}u(t)(r - e^{rt})dt} = e^{-rT}x(T) \end{align} 

The firm tries to maximize profits $\Pi$ \begin{align} \max_{K,L}\{\Pi(K,L) = F(K,L) - RK - wL\} \end{align} where $F$ is the linear homogeneous production function, $R$ the rental rate of capital $K$ and $w$ the rental rate (wage) of labor $L$. FOCs are given by \begin{align} \Pi_K &= 0 \Leftrightarrow R = F_k\\ \Pi_L &= 0 \Leftrightarrow w = F_L. \end{align} Footnote 1 of page 33 in Acemoglu (2009) tells us that the FOCs can also derived by cost minimization. With (2.6) and (2.7) being $w=F_L$ and $R=F_K$ respectively. The firm tries to minize costs \begin{align} &\min_{K,L}\{RK + wL\}\\ \text{s.t.}~~& F(k,L) = Y \end{align} where $Y$ is some output level. Set up Lagrangian \begin{align} \mathcal{L} = RK + wL + \lambda(F(K,L) - Y) \end{align} FOCs are given by \begin{align} \mathcal{L}_K = 0& \Leftrightarrow R + \lambda F_K = 0\\ \mathcal{L}_L = 0& \Leftrightarrow w + \lambda F_L = 0\\ \mathcal{L}_\lambda = 0& \Leftrightarrow F(K,L) - Y = 0 \end{align} 

More precisely if $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell} : x \geq 0\}$, the production function would be $$ f:\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n}, \quad n\geq 2 $$ For simplicity we can assume the firm operates in a competitive market so that the price is given. My question is, how does the firm choose the input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{\ell}$ as to maximize profits? I did some research and apparently the type of problem this is a “multi-objective” optimization problem, and it appears to be an active field in engineering. Some of the methods to solve this kind of problems use pareto-dominance style arguments. I wanted to know if anyone could clarify the specific question of multi product profit maximization, and more generally I would also appreciate any literature or books on this topic (multi objective optimization), written for economists, as I have been searching in google and every book I find appears to be written for engineers. I suspect that a treatment of this topic from an economics point of view would involve some discussion of social choice theory. Any help is most welcomed! 

A classic on public choice and taxation theory is "The Power to Tax: Analytic Foundations of Fiscal Constitution" by Brennan and Buchanan Really interesting book and relatively easy read. 

Please refer to the two images posted at this link: $URL$ Referring to Page 2, I'm not quite sure what the author is trying to say regarding the two bracketed portions. Considering the first bracketed portion, when the author says "purchased less than Q0", is the author still referring to a point on the demand schedule line? Also referring to the first bracketed portion, how do we know the consumer "value additional consumption more than its cost to her", and thus purchase more? How do I represent all these graphically? 

I know that the conventional explanation linking fall in cost of production and rise in supply is that a fall in cost of production of A means that it is more profitable to produce A. Thus, suppliers will be incentivised to produce more of A, hence rise in supply of A. My question is - why should suppliers even want to produce more? Can't they just enjoy the higher profits attained automatically through the fall in COP? What exactly is the explanation for them wanting to produce more? This is the missing link in many explanations I see and I hope to clarify this, thanks! 

I wrote some silly program where you just fix endowment $e=(e_1,e_2)$ and utility functions $u=(u_1(x_1,y_1),u_2(x_2,y_2))$. The example provides an illustration for your utility functions and $x_1+x_2=1$ and $y_1+y_2=1$. I've drawn 100 indifference curves on an equally spaced grid of given utility levels $\bar u_1\in[u_1(0,0),u_1(1,1)]$ (blue) and $\bar u_2\in[u_2(0,0),u_2(1,1)]$ (red). The black line is the contract curve. I added a second figure with some initial endowment $e_1 = (0.25, 0.75)$, $e_2 = (0.75, 0.25)$ and core. 

Consider some time series data $X=\{x_t:t\in[0,\infty)\}$. Define a steady state by \begin{align} x\in X:x_{t+1} - x_t = 0 \end{align} and the log deviation from steady state with \begin{align} \hat x_t:=\ln x_t - \ln_x. \end{align} Now we can express $x_t$ as \begin{align} x_t=x\exp(\hat x_t). \end{align} Consider the the following equation \begin{align} a_t = b_t c_t^\alpha + D\mathbb{E}_t\left[\left(\frac{e_{t+1}}{e_t}\right)\left(\frac{f_t}{g_t}\right)^\beta a_{t+1}\right] \end{align} where $D$ is some constant, which is ought to be log linearized for every time dependent variable around steady state. First Attempt Express every variable by its new definition,i.e. \begin{align} a\exp(\hat a_t) = b c^\alpha \exp(\hat b_t + \alpha\hat c_t)+ D\left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^\beta a\mathbb{E}_t\left[\exp(\hat e_{t+1} - \hat e_t + \beta(\hat f_t - \hat g_t) + \hat a_{t+1})\right] \end{align} which should simplify to \begin{align} \exp(\hat a_t) = \exp(\hat b_t + \alpha\hat c_t)+\mathbb{E}_t\left[\exp(\hat e_{t+1} - \hat e_t + \beta(\hat f_t - \hat g_t) + \hat a_{t+1})\right] \end{align}
