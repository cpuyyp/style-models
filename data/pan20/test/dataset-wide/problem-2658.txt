Whereby I assume a line segment of fixed length is uncontroversially finite. If we take a line segment that is increasing in length over time; does it really make sense to say the segment is finite in length? We may be able to say it was such and such a length at such and such a time in the past or in the future, but we would be unable to say what the length of the segment is now, for any utterance of its length immediately becomes incorrect as another interval of time passes. 

According to the Sorites, all men have beards, they just vary in length, density and coarseness. In a loose sense, a beard must have some appreciable length to be considered a beard. Yet, how much is 'appreciable'? Based on the vagueness of the predicate 'has a beard', I'm not lying when I say such and such, has a beard despite being clean shaven, because what I'm saying is true. Even those people who use the loose sense of the meaning 'beard' would come up with different explanations of what they think a beard is amongst themselves. So, why would someone argue that I lied, if suppose I saw a man rob a store and I tell the police he had a beard despite being clean shaven? 

(5 x 11111...)/(6 x 11111...) is not equal to 5/6 (5 x 11111...) equals infinity and (6 x 11111...) equals infinity. (infinity)/(infinity) is always undefined. The obscure nature of Pythagoras' School makes it hard to know who discovered irrational numbers (Hippasus?). They probably found the difficulty while examining a right triangle whose sides a and b are both equal to one. Perhaps, to their horror, they found the number two is not a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, ... are perfect squares and render an integer when their square root is taken). Pythagoras reasoned 'all is numbers' and also, that for any right triangle, the squares of sides a and b is exactly equal to the square of its hypotenuse (line c), but this can be said another way, the square erected on the diagonal of a square has twice the area of the original square. The difficulty they had was trying to create a ratio of two integers that would account for the square root of two. They tried and tried and tried, and they couldn't find such a ratio. Someone (Euclid?) later proved such a ratio does not exist. (The Presocratics, Philip Wheelwright (Editor), 1997, p.206). 

The clearest example, in my opinion, is `on denoting'. There, a logical analysis of the definite description in language is used to offer an account of how we can meaningfully talk about non-existent objects, such as unicorns, without having to commit ourselves to their existence (as abstract object, for example) - see meinong for such a view. The way Russell did this was to analyse a proposition such as `the present king of France is bald' as, there is an x((x is the king of france and x is bald) and, for any y, (if y is the king of france then y=x)). This then allows us to talk about the present king of france or unicorns without having to commit ourselves to the existence of such things. 

There is a large literature on this: priest has two relevant chapters in his doubt truth to be a liar. It is true that there are many logics, all of which are more suited to some purposes than others. However, this does not preclude there being one true logic in W's sense of the term. The thing to bear in mind is what the purpose of logic is. The philosophically interesting one, which W plausible held, is to capture logical consequence (See Dummett's Justification of Deduction for an argument that this must be prior to any other concept). Hence, if we are not pluralists about logical consequence (Beall and Restall are an example of such pluralists) we should think that there is a single notion of logical consequence we are attempting to capture. The logic that does this would be the one true logic. The other logics we have are appropriate for other purposes, or where the domain allows us to add further restrictions on the consequence relation. But from the mere fact that there are different logics we are unawarranted in concluding that there is no one true logic. I think this is all irrelevant to concerns about the supernatural. One should always, in my view, be careful about reading too much into logic -see for example those that misuse Goedel's Incompleteness Theorems. 

It's been argued that God doesn't exist because there is so much evil in the world. For example, suppose a person is violently murdered - an innocent child say. They argue, God could have prevented that but He didn't, therefore He does not exist. Are there any good counter arguments to this position? 

Consider the following, "if A then B" implies "A only if B". For example, take "if it is raining, the sidewalk will be wet,". Therefore, "it is raining only if the sidewalk is wet." The first expression is straightforward, but what about the second? Only if the sidewalk is wet, is it possible it is raining. This does not mean other things, such as a water hose, cannot make the sidewalk wet, rather if it's wet, only then is it possible it is raining. So, what is the relationship between "if A then B" and "A only if B"? In other words, does the first expression guarantee the truth of the second? 

The prisoners in the cave are just ordinary human beings; whether or not they have free will is another question in philosophy. The point behind the "allegory of the cave" is the prisoners believe the projection screen in front of them is real, in much the same way a motion picture appears real. One day a prisoner escapes and discovers the world is much larger and more unusual that he had thought. He returns to the cave to share this knowledge with the other prisoners. They just laugh at him and think he has gone mad. 

Kant criticized Anselm's argument for the existence of God by counter arguing the expression 'God exists' adds nothing to our meaning of God and so it cannot be true a God that exists is greater than a god that does not exist. Yet, modern atheists, most frequently say such things as unicorns, dragons, fairies, ghosts, the great pumpkin, etc. do not exist. So it seems existence is a predicate according to them. Why is existence not a true predicate with respect to Anselm's argument? What is the main difficulty with his argument besides Kant's criticism? 

As far as I am aware, its a standard distinction. The idea is that the appropriate reference of lots of terms is not directly known by everyone, but we all use those terms correctly because we interact in some more or less direct manner, with the experts. An example might be `brain'. Putnam is a semantic externalist, so he holds that there must be some connection between brains' to refer to brains. However, I have never seen a brain not had anything to do with one. This does not stop me from referring to brains because I have an appropriate, indirect, connection to people who do see brains etc. Thus, there is a division in linguistic labour: I rely on others to ensure that the reference of some of my terms is correct. 

Let ZFC2 be the Second-Order formalisation of ZFC. The Second-Order Axiom schema of Comprehension (part of the deductive system for SOL) says that for every formula (of SOL) there is a relation with the same extension (shapiro 1991). If we formalise ZFC2, then the domain is all sets and the second-order quantifiers range over all the subsets of the domain. But then, what stops Russell's Paradox from arising? I know it doesn't because ZFC2 is equivalent to Morse-Kelley set theory. 

As an addendum to Alexander's answer, what you find sometimes is that what is denied is the reality of the future. The idea, that can be linked to Dummett, is that, because statements about the future (e.g. tomorrow it will rain) do not have a fixed truth-value, we should be anti-realists about it. This should not be interpreted quite as saying that the future doesn't exist or that talk of the future is illegitimate though; one might, for instance, think that we ought to reason intuitionistically about the future. Of course, fatalists deny that statements about the future don't have a fixed truth-value. 

Hatred, as best as I can define it, is a hardening of the heart fuelled by anger against perceived enemies. Does anything good ever come from anger and hatred? Hatred of enemies sounds like a good idea, but as Nietzsche put it, be careful of turning into a monster yourself. 

Aristotle wrote, As for Comedy, it is an imitation of men worse than the average; worse, however, not as regards any and every sort of fault, but only as regards one particular kind, the Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. (Poetics, 1449a, Ch. 5). In a crude sense, I suppose he means we laugh at the pitiful; it's the so called schadenfreude. That we derive amusement by seeing others suffer, as it makes us feel better about our own miseries and inadequacies. I've been guilty of it and this kind of humour is "sick," but I think Aristotle is right. Should one feel bad because they laugh at the misfortunes of others? 

Helen Keller lost her senses of both sight and hearing at a very young age. She was described as being an "animal". While her teacher, Annie Sullivan, held her hands under a water pump, the young girl realized the sign language impressed into her palm by her teacher were words. Certainly her experience of consciousness depended, at least in part, upon her available sense impressions. A being, like a bat, experiences consciousness differently than we do because they "see" with their ears. But to answer your question, if I lost all my senses, I would be in a vegetative state, in much the same way a person put under a general anaesthetic experiences nothing. In my opinion, consciousness does depend on the sense impressions and the mind is nothing without them. 

I am aware that a similar question was asked about the type theory in the principia, but I'm more interested in what the relationship between, say Martin-Lof Type theory and intuitionistic logic is. 

Haacks Philosophies of Logics (or something similar, I don't remember the exact title) is a classic. Dummett's Logical Basis of Metaphysics, which Mauro Allegranza suggested, is one of the most exiting texts in the field, in my opinion. However, it is also difficult - very difficult in parts. So before reading that I'd suggest Dummett's philosophical basis of Intuitionism (also the final chapter of his elements of intuitionism) and justification of deduction. [Both of these papers are available in `Truth and Other enigmas]. 

Sufficient conditions are not the opposite of necessary conditions. A necessary condition is one which cannot be lacking for something to happen. However, it being present doesn't entail that it does happen. A sufficient condition is one which could be absent and the event still happen, but it being present is enough to make the event happen (in the presence of all necessary conditions). 

The way I think about it is as follows: the ontology of a theory is given by the variables we quantify over to express the theory. The ideology is given by the semantics: what we take the predicates to be referring to (hence, not just truth-conditions). 

As far as I know, there is no specific branch of philosophy that deals with superstitions. Philosophy, within its various subsets, can be thought of as the study and justification of beliefs so, for example, within theology religious superstitions will be assessed. However, there is no specific discipline tasked with finding superstitions and debunking them. 

In North America, we celebrate a glorious holiday called Groundhog Day. On the second of February, the marmots awaken and leave their burrows, along with their families, to examine the weather. If the animals see their shadows, they'll retreat back in, and it means six more weeks of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, if they don't see their shadows, spring is well on its way. Hurray! For example, examine this poem from Scotland. If Candle-mas Day is bright and clear, There'll be two winters in the year. If Candle-mas be fair and bright, Winter has another flight. If Candle-mas brings clouds and rain, Winter will not come again. Now, skepticism says groundhogs are unable to predict future weather events. But are they so sure? Isn't it possible that groundhogs can sense things about weather that we are unable to? I understand marmots are dull sighted, but have an incredibly good sense of smell. It makes sense then, these rodents, are able to detect things about weather us humans are unable to? 

Suppose I take any finite length and subtract half of it continuously. So the size of the remainder, after each subtraction, is equal to its original length multiplied by one half taken to the nth power, where n is the number of subtractions. (e.g. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32,...). Now with each subtraction of a half, the size of the remainder decreases, and as the original length is finite, it should eventually diminish to nothing. That would agree with the concept of a mathematical limit, because the limit of this sequence or exponential function, as the number of subtractions tends to infinity (i.e. n), is zero. Here is the difficulty I'm having, each subtraction always leaves exactly one half of the previous remainder, thus it cannot actually disappear altogether or the finial subtraction would be complete removal and not subtraction of a half. This is, loosely, Zeno of Elea's argument against motion. In this case, I'm asking when does the remainder of something, after many subtractions from it, still exist?
