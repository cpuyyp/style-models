The magnetic fields have effectively disappeared many times in the past (during periods of magnetic field reversal). This has not correlated with extinction events, so I see no reason to think it would be dangerous at all. $URL$ Also, the current magnetic field funnels charged particles down onto the poles, yet the animals living at the poles seem unaffected. 

I would add that the Soviets (and the USA) do not target sites because they have launched missiles. First, any site which has already launched its missiles is of no military importance anymore, so why blow it up? Second, an enemy force has very little real time intelligence during a nuclear war. Even if your silo had launched, the soviets would have no way of knowing. Surveillance satellites could eventually detect launches (although I don't think they could during the brief window in which the Nike missiles were deployed), however it is likely that the very first thing any attacking nation would do when launching a nuclear strike would be to detonate a few multi megaton warheads in low earth orbit in order to create an EMP effect. This quickly results in the destruction of LEO satellites. Third, ICBMs are amazingly inflexible in their targeting. The entire ICBM strategy revolved around attacking stationary targets which have been known about for years. It does not involve retargeting missiles at newly discovered targets. One alternative that I have wondered about is whether the minuteman ICBMs have the secret (and thus untested) ability to serve as anti-ballistic missiles. The scenario would work as follows: An all-out soviet attack would be detected by US satellites and over the horizon radar. (Details depending on the exact year of your attack.) Some portion of minuteman ICBMs are loaded with updated targeting parameters which cause them to detonate maybe 100 (?) miles overhead. The launch is timed to intercept the incoming wave of soviet warheads and destroy them with an X-ray pulse. The timing information comes from SAC. You could have this tactic be as successful or unsuccessful as you need for your story goals. Perhaps it only winds up preserving a single missile squadron? 

It may be possible that life is really old. The temperature of background radiation was in the Goldilocks region only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. And there is no guarantee that nothing exists beyond the cosmological event horizon - meaning there may be things from outside the blast radius of the Big Bang that work their way in. With most of the 4.5 billion year life of the observed universe, or with the uncountable amount of time that has passed outside the cosmological horizon, it is possible that some very strange things may have evolved out there and come here trapped in meteoric glass or as dust. Human kind is an interesting species structurally. It begins as three sheets of extremely different specialized cells: nervous, digestive, and skeletal/circulatory. It's almost as if the human species is three different species in a symbiotic relationship sharing one common genetic library. But it doesn't end there : some of the most fundamental building blocks to all cellular life don't come from the human genome at all. In this strange world - mitochondria, an ancestor of ancient bacteria, provide power and proteins for most animal cells. The process by which ancient mitochondria may have invaded animal cells and settled there is called endosymbiosis. It is possible that a similar bacteria-sized endosymbiote, maybe even one specialized for human kind, is in the environment, trapped in a glacier, recently arrived, or so on. This bacteria, specialized as it is, might not be capable of infecting a healthy cell. During apoptosis and autophagy, cells wind down their existences in an orderly fashion, taking apart the nucleus and inner workings of the cell before giving up. However, when animal cells die due to injury (necrosis) the cell struggles and eventually fails to hold it's inner workings against the forces of osmotic pressure. During this time the cell membrane begins to fall apart in pieces as it is compromised. This might even be how mitochondria originally entered animal cells. And our hypothetical specialist bacteria may be able to come in and set up shop. Mitochondria quickly earn their keep providing cell energy and proteins. Endosymbiont X (for lack of a better term) may likewise help organize the dying shop. Maybe providing a great number of traits similar to Tardigrades, which include protection from starvation, dehydration, radiation, and shock. This might lead to the lungs being repurposed as a hemocoel. A hemocoel might require filling from some of the classic undead foods. Endosymbiont X might also be able to produce factors that protect telomeres from drop off. Telomeres are the winding that protects DNA from unravelling, and is believed to correlate with cell life. The new proteins could lead to structural changes in a human host, causing it to become deformed. Or, cell takeup of Endosymbiont X, as it depends on some pretty optimistic timing, might leave a good portion of the human actually dead, until those parts drop off or are removed. 

Teach the children chi-unrelated martial arts from a young age (~2years young) - this has, just like in our world, several positive effects in general: They will get to know their body and how to interact with it and the world, they will learn discipline (mainly because discipline is necessary to avoid injury as most people come to realize quite naturally when they do sports) and they will learn that they are capable of inflicting terrible injuries on themselfs and others. (The main point of many martial arts is to gain control over power output, not increase.) Around age ~4 children become increasingly aware of 'chi', probably by accidently using it - starting from this point they will incorporate it into their usual training in order to gain control of it (much like an extension of their body). Think of things like breathing techniques but for 'chi'; in reality we use them to gain a better understanding of our body and mind, and when you add chi to the mix it's a very safe way of getting used to this new 'body part' since the effort and output can be finely regulated rather quickly. I choose age 4 because that's given the children 2 years of time to get to know their physical body. You may think that's too early (in fact, there won't be any conflict or elaborate technique in martial arts that early on), but at such a young age children are incredibly good at grasping concepts, even if they can't explain it or seemingly don't do it right. In other words, they will understand how to move their bodies, even if they are not physically capable yet of making it look especially smooth. As the children improve their control over chi and grow their minds mature as well. Before, they might have been told not to overdo it, but I'd say at age 7 it's high time to have proper discussions and explanations of the explicit dangers of overusing 'chi' and, much more important yet, how to recognize when it has been overused (this also means that I would afterwards start to gradually reduce any safety buffers against overuse, for them to gain experience in recognizing their limits). Much like one needs to be told that some muscle pain is perfectly okay, and some isn't. Lighter versions of these explanations will have been given throughout the years already, I'm just saying overtly simple arguments may not be enough to satisfy/convince the children anymore. Oh, explanations will probably also get shorter and shorter as they grow older, albeit more complicated (the simplest answers for toddlers are often the most elaborate ones one ever comes up with for a question). Afterwards, since control over 'chi' is the main concern in order to improve efficiency for their later lifes, proper 'chi' practice will be included in the training plan. It is important not to neglect the original martial arts however, as it's beneficial to balance different kinds of strains ('chi', non-'chi' mental training, normal physical training etc). Starting around age 11 children have gotten a proper foundation and understanding in both martial arts and the art of 'chi' from a fundamental control point of view. It may be time to let them have a go at the wonders of using 'chi' for things like stitching (without touching the needle) or building LEGO castles etc. Make sure these things are just as properly supervised in order to avoid overuse of 'chi' - the children might know their limits, but everyone forgets their limits while having fun (such as reading a novel all the way into the next day, always thinking "just one more page"). Gradually introduce a greater variety and greater specialisations of 'chi' applications, and have them get emersed in what they want. Perhaps they don't really want to use their 'chi' anyway, that should be fine too. Getting closer to age 18, but at the latest then, you will need to REDO all explanations and fundamental physical and 'chi' training methods they've done as little children. Why? Because they have gotten sloppy at their fundamentals and are not in touch with themselfs on such a broadly deep level as they were at age 9 or 11. And why is that? 'Cause their minds are filled with a life full of experiences that overshadow such basic, now almost instinctive knowledge. This is also a point where many athletes and such fail to do an overhaul of their abilities and gradually get worse. Now, don't get me wrong - I'm mostly referring to getting worse at truly understanding what one now doesn't even thinks about. Not having to think about it is a good thing, but that stops being true when one cannot understand it anymore. An example, do you remember how you learned to use a fork? Even if you don't that's fine - as long as you can still explain to others how to use a fork. We want to avoid a situation where one can use a fork themself but has become incapable of explaining how one does it - just transfer that to the martial/'chi' arts and you'll see that 'chi' at least ain't something you want to get sloppy with. Thanks to the previous step the children, now young adults, can pretty much use their 'chi' without any harmful side effects at great efficiency while understanding their abilities. From here on some may choose to further train their bodies and mind to increase their general capability to exert more force and more intensively focus on something. At this point they are capable of expanding their own horizons by their own strength. 

You could exchange strings for a machine that reads minds and grants requests at its own discretion. Examples are 'Forbidden Planet' and 'The Matrix'. However, if you want to avoid the mechanical or reality is a hoax, you might have the planet be a gestalt intelligence ($URL$ This has been done in fiction before, but I can't recall the title. In this instance, still, to make anything flashy and dramatic would either require reality to be fake (the dreams of the planet) or the world to be connected to some fancy machine that provides delivery through some as-yet-unknown process. As others have pointed out, the really magical seeming things in quantum mechanics may just be an artifact of using probabilistic mathematics, instead of deterministic math, to solve the problems. This hasn't been conclusively proven yet. 

Other answers will be better at the social implications of what is considered an acceptable age to start learning. I'm sure a 'chi' teacher would differ in opinion from overzealous parents, and those from parents that don't want their kids to have anything to do with 'chi'. Maybe the government is even regulating this stuff in your setting (though I sure hope not, since governments are known to be bad at these things ;) ) I'll try playing out what could be considered a responsible way of introducing children to 'chi' in order to maximize control while minimizing negative effects on mental health. First of all, you stated that chi can not exert any more force than the user could exert without it. That's good, that means with perfect control over your 'chi' you can still improve the power of it even after you've become an adult. So childhood would likely focus on practising that control. How I imagine training would actually turn out in the long run: 

It seems that you are positing that the cost of methane, fresh water, and electricity will plummet in the region around the Sahara. Based on this premise alone, fossil fuels would not necessarily disappear. The most expensive fossil fuels (e.g. oil shales) would be shut down, but existing, land-based oil wells are extremely inexpensive to run and would continue to produce oil even at very low market prices. An inexpensive source of alternative energy would make it much easier to pass anti-fossil fuel legislation in an effort to reduce climate change. I will assume that such a law goes into effect, and that it is enforced successfully across the entire globe. When wealth comes from fixed resources which are tied to geography, the result is usually an oppressive regime and tremendous wealth/power disparities. In the feudal era lords became the government because they controlled agricultural land. They did not control the tradesmen in the cities because those people were highly mobile and could take their wealth generating ability with them. In the modern era most nations where mineral wealth represents a large proportion of the GDP come to be governed by whatever small group of people control that mineral resource (often oil). This is the case in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Russia, The Central African Republic, etc. If a fairly small group of people is in control of this Sahara Project, it will rule in an authoritarian manner. Employees and other residents of the area will not have strong rights such as freedom of speech. Owners will appoint the judges or whatever arbiters are used for the legal system. There will be no rule of law governing disputes between owners and everyone else, as the owners will always win every dispute. There might be rule of law governing disputes between non-owners though. The ownership class will get away with rape, murder, assault, and theft. Their children will be enormously wealthy and immune to law, but will often have no real power until their parents reach retirement age. Held in a state of perpetual adolescence their behavior will be terrible. Politics among the ownership class will be cutthroat as everyone will jostle for power in the absence of an objective rule of law. Despite what you say about there not being locals to displace, every piece of land (with the possible exception of Antarctica) has people who consider it theirs. The owners might be miles away, but they exist. It is very likely that the project would proceed as follows: A large foreign company (backed by massive injections of private capital) approaches the local people of each region of the Sahara and negotiates a deal with them. Normally the locals would receive little compensation in these types of contracts, but foreign lawyers rush in to represent the locals for no cash up front but a huge share of revenue. Thus the locals are able to negotiate very lucrative joint ownership contracts with the company. In the ensuing years the cleverest locals are able to buy out other locals using a wide variety of clever business tactics. When ownership finally stabilizes, a very few families control most of the land and become the de facto royalty (similar to the establishment of the house of Saud). The rest of the local families form a long tail of mid level and small time nobles - much wealthier and more powerful than workers, but trivial compared to the royalty. The ownership class will consist of the native land holders, major company shareholders, the company board and officers, and the lawyers who helped the land holders negotiate the deal. Labor, both skilled (there will need to be engineers to install, maintain, and troubleshoot the facilities) and unskilled, will be non-citizen resident workers. They will have few rights, and will not be allowed to retire in the Sahara. Their children will not have citizenship. Any adult without a job (or a spouse with a job) will be forced to leave. Any child without employed parents will be forced to leave. The Sahara company will need to run its own military as the facilities will be very vulnerable to sabotage, terrorism, and military attack. Pipelines and power lines can be bombed. Solar panels can be destroyed by nearly anything. Electrical substations in particular are extremely vulnerable to attack. If the Sahara can do this, then other deserts would likely be almost as good and would replicate this economy. Expect large rival projects in the Atacama, Australia, southern Africa, the Namib, Mexico, and the US southwest. The Gobi will be able to produce huge amounts of power, even if water is not convenient. The old oil powers will experience upheaval. Smart families will be among the investors in the Sahara company (and its competitors). Stupid families and nations will just become poor and irrelevant. Oil will still be used for plastics and lubricants, so it will not go away, but its price will plummet. Plastics, in particular, will become extremely inexpensive. The governments of the oil nations will be overturned. These nations will become much more normal, with governments which are controlled by a wide variety of industrial and commercial powers rather than just a tiny minority of oil powers. The behavior of these nations would become less outrageous as they adopt policies more in line with what makes business leaders happy. (i.e. stability, rule of law, free markets) Coal has never comprised a large fraction of any nation's GDP and its collapse will not result in major changes to any nation state. Coal will have essentially no use in a post-fossil fuel economy. The same goes for natural gas. Norway and Alaska will face financial crises and be forced to cease their negative taxation programs. You mention the electricity being sold to Africa, but a large portion would also go north, under the Mediterranean to Europe. The cost of power increases with the length of transmission lines, so there would be a gradient of electricity prices based on distance from deserts. Wherever electricity is cheapest, massive aluminum smelting operations will be established. If the average price of power across the globe decreases, then so will the cost of aluminum (as well as titanium). Aluminum smelting operations produce enormous quantities of waste heat, which could presumably be used in the already existing water purification plants. Having massive quantities of cheap, fresh water available in areas with plentiful sunshine and warm temperatures would result in an ideal agricultural environment. The price of food should plummet as Saharan vegetables become common ingredients at the dinner table. The change in albedo and evaporation rates this would produce in the deserts would cause unpredictable climate changes. Winds would move a little differently, and rainfall would happen in different places. In general though, the net result would be a slightly wetter, not a drier world - especially in the areas around the desert zones. It is very unlikely that the national borders of the desert regions would be redrawn, so I think you should assume that the nations containing large amounts of desert would become much more powerful. This would include Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, Oman, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, but also Namibia, and Chile. I think you should have Saudi Arabia be one of the smart oil powers which smoothly parlays its oil wealth into Sahara Project investments. Russia seems likely to wind up a very big loser in this transition. It has little access to solar power, and has hobbled its industrial and commercial economies with crazy oil-state authoritarianism. This could be awkward as they still have one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world. Perhaps the US and China restart the Clinton-era policy of purchasing Russian fissile material from old nuclear warheads? (If you're not aware, during the 1990s the USA purchased huge quantities of uranium and plutonium from old Soviet warheads, and then burned this material in US power reactors. In exchange Russia gained much needed cash during their transition from communism.) 

A species that does not understand death would, I think, first try to understand what just happened. Are their peers injured or asleep? Why can't the be mended and brought back? Then, they would try to understand their place in this. Are they alright with some of their kind being destroyed? Does it bother them? Or are they apathetic? After orienting themselves towards death and slaughter, I think your species would then turn to consider the attackers. From whatever evidence they have about the encounter, is there any thing they could have done to avoid the destructive outcome. Could they communicate better? Could they have simply acquiesced to some list of demands? Could they develop tools (like fences to keep animals out or cages to keep animals in) that could be used as protective perimeters? Are they sociable enough to organize look outs to be wary next time these hostile creatures return? After orienting themselves also, then, to responding to the attackers, they might choose to ask themselves if they should be proactive and attack first? Does wider conflict seem inevitable (as Japan felt before Pearl Harbor)? Does your species have a sense of justice demanding that these injuries be avenged? Does your species have philosophies or religions that recommend a particular response (mercy, tolerance)? I think how your species answers these questions would drive their response. 

One especially dramatic scenario would be for all plants to die out, resulting in a world populated entirely be 100% carnivorous animals and people eating each other, with a very rapidly dwindling population. Combining this "red in tooth and claw" ecosystem with the perpetual darkness would lead to a terrifying mood! In absolute darkness the population would dwindle way too quickly though, but it could be tempered to have an arbitrarily slow population decay rate by adjusting the amount of light the world receives (and thus the rate of extinction for plants). Another option would be to explore alternative food webs. In the real world, total darkness still allows a few types of ecosystem. There are oceanic plumes which support a food web on chemical energy captured from the plumes by bacteria. In your world I would imagine there are highly magical point sources which emit "life energy", powering small island ecosystems around themselves. The rest of the deep ocean runs entirely on food particles which drift down from the upper reaches (it's called oceanic snow). Filter feeders scoop this up and are eaten by predators. If the darkness in your world is caused by a cloud layer, then there could be some kind of flying or floating plants existing above the cloud deck, powering an ecosystem on the ground with discarded, rotting leaves. Detritivores like earth worms and millipedes would feed upon the leaf mold. Larger animals would eat the detritivores and mushrooms. People would eat everything. This strikes me as another very dramatic option! Cave ecosystems largely run on debris brought in by animals like bats, which leave the caves to feed. Copraphages and detritivores like cockroaches feed off the excrement of the bats (and fungus that grows on it). Check out this piece by the amazing David Attenborough $URL$ Your world could conceivably have aerial access to another realm where the sun DOES shine. Bats, birds, or flying insects might feed in the sunlit realm, then return to the realm of darkness to roost. The sunlit realm might be very tall plateaus which rise above the opaque cloud deck. For example, see the amazing tepuis $URL$ The last real world ecosystem I can think of are the microorganisms that live in the bedrock of the crustal plates. They have extremely slow metabolisms which are powered by chemical weathering of rocks and chemical reactions caused by the heat of the mantle. This ecosystem exists miles down into the earth. It's hard to see how your story could revolve around something like this, but maybe you see a possibility that I've missed? Anyway, my advice is to figure out how your ecosystem is powered first. Everything else (technology, culture, ecology, etc.) will follow from that. 

To lightly address the matter of children running around with superpowers: Being a martial artist myself I may be biased, but I expect the risks of anything bad 'chi' related to happen to be far smaller than current common causes of grief (such as bad driving, drugs, etc). When you understand from a young age why control over your actions is important and how to apply it you are far more likely to exert that control. Not because you're automatically a better person but because getting into trouble is a pain (not the conflict itself, but the after effects such as teachers getting angry, parents scolding you etc) and easy to avoid. What I mean is, the better you understand your capability of seriously inflicting harm on others with less effort that you'd need to do a 50m sprint the more you shun away from situations that might make you loose control. By understanding risks and how troublesome they are most kids trained in martial arts are actually really cool about things compared to their peers. They comprehend how easy it is to make a mistake, and they have the discipline to overcome obstacles (such as uncomfortable situations) rather than try to forcefully destroy them. Edit: Regarding Aify's comment, I agree that there will be cases of misuse and quite a great variety of ways to annoy others thanks to the 'chi' with different grades of danger. On the lower end I'm thinking of that really bothersome feeling of someone holding a finger close to your face without touching it - now imagine another kid doing something akin to that from a 10m distance with no way to slap away their hand. There's really no limit on the terrible creativity 'chi' could be used in this setting to annoy others. Of course, that would be the harmless version - there will be fights and full-blown conflicts between youths, possibly made .. more decisive .. by the involvment of 'chi'. Still, I want to believe that on the larger scale problems with violent 'chi' misuse would remain relatively rare. Not only because of the proper training (that they will ideally receive) but also because by the Question's premise it will still be easier for most children to use physical attacks (e.g. bare fists) than their 'chi' since these are mentally less exhaustive and require less concentration/focus. Any kid/adult who can keep their calm in a fight has a good change of being mature enough not to participate in one, the rest will likely choose the simpler option most of the time. Possible measures I can think of are mostly preventive - proper parenting, supportive and positive environment, and refusing to teach children that are considered too high-risk. 'Chi' trainers/teachers should have a good grasp of how they evaluate that risk in each of their pupils. Children could probably be safely removed from training up to step 3 above. I'd guess that any time later you would run the risk that the children continue to teach themself wrongly and cause themself and others great harm. Not training high-risk children seems effective to me mainly because 'chi' is set to be extremely difficult to get right on one's own, so the earlier the better. May not make much sense from an emotional maturity point of view, though - I don't know if it is even possible to tell early on whether a child will turn out high-risk/aggressive. 

This concept is sometimes known as "rod from god". The rod would have to actively steer through the atmosphere no matter if the target is moving or not. (Essentially it needs to be a robotic glider.) The way this works is an orbiting satellite (probably orbiting west to east) fires the projectile so that the projectile's orbit intersects the atmosphere. Once the projectile hits the atmosphere, it uses its aerodynamic surfaces to curve its motion (which starts out with a west to east orbit that is very similar to its satellite) downward, toward the target. Without aerodynamic surfaces to cause a sharp turn, the projectile would just careen horizontally through the atmosphere until it had lost most of its orbital velocity. You want to preserve as much of that orbital velocity as possible and change the direction to be aimed at your target. If your target is moving, the projectile needs to track that movement. One really big hurdle for this particular projectile is that it's moving very quickly, and you want it to hit a very small target. How does the projectile know where that target is located? It is presumably radioed the coordinates of the target before it launches, but how does it keep track of target movements once it launches? Optical tracking would require a very powerful telescope. If you want to see human sized targets, that requires adaptive optics and a telescope the size of the Hubble space telescope. Your telescope needs to be in the nose of a hypersonic missile, which is an extremely harsh environment for anything, let alone extremely precise optical sensors and transparent windows. Also, there is cloud cover to deal with, and your hypersonic passage through the atmosphere will produce some amount of incandescent plasma in front of your camera. It probably makes more sense to guide the projectile externally, and just radio coordinate changes up to the projectile. The satellite could presumably do this, unless it's night time or the target is obscured by cloud cover or trees or buildings. Another problem is that the time it takes for the satellite to talk to the projectile gets longer and longer the closer the projectile gets to its target. The one way delay is more than a millisecond, which might be uncomfortably long. I think the ideal situation would be for the projectile to get multiple streams of data, one stream from the satellite, one stream from its own internal gyroscopes and camera, and at least one more stream from a spotter within a few miles of the target who can actually see it. That spotter could be a person aiming a device at the target, or it could be a flying our ground-based drone. Regardless the spotter would likely be shooting a low power laser at the target in order to determine its precise distance from the spotter. Subtracting that distance from the spotter's GPS coordinates derives coordinates for the target. The spotter's scope would continuously radio these coordinates up to the projectile so it could alter its course. The projectile would also have its camera attuned to the exact wavelength used by the spotting laser, and it would steer directly for it as soon as it was detectable. The laser would not be visible to human eyes because it would be infrared. A really good spotter system would also have a camera watching the sky for the glare of the incoming projectile. It would measure the angle between the spotter and the projectile in order to give the projectile more precise information about its current location. Hopefully you're getting the sense that this is all extremely difficult. While I think it's possible to do at our current technology levels, I haven't heard of anyone doing so. I don't think a 100% hit ratio is ever possible with something like this (at least until some new, unforeseen technological breakthroughs occur). When describing this system, you should emphasize the extreme difficulty of its task, and all of the complexity of the data processing that needs to happen for the projectile to hit its target. You should also emphasize the extreme physical conditions involved. The G forces would be extreme. The tungsten aerodynamic surfaces would be glowing white hot. The camera window would need to be actively cooled to delay melting and maintain transparency. Regarding how much damage you could cause with this kind of projectile, it all depends on the mass of the projectile and how much orbital velocity it is able to maintain during its passage through the atmosphere. The wikipedia article you linked to suggests a mach 10 terminal velocity and a kinetic energy roughly equal to the projectile's mass in dynamite. (i.e. a 10 ton projectile results in roughly the same degree of damage that would be produced by 10 tons of dynamite.) In general though, I think it's easy to say that the projectile would produce much more focused and directional damage, whereas the dynamite explosion would produce equal damage in every direction. One other clever trick would be to have the projectile break into zillions of tiny pieces right before it impacts (unless your target is a bunker 100 feet underground). This would increase the size of the affected ground and keep the damage focused on the surface, rather than spread out under the soil. 

Hide in Someone's Home As with Anne Frank in the attic, your targeted nobody could stay with a family member, a friend, or a friend-of-a-friend. The more remotely connected, the better, because the regime team sent to find him (or her) will think to check family, friends, and associates. The best case might be someone that a friend-of-a-friend knows is sympathetic to the problem, and has set aside a hidden room or basement for people to hide in, even in the event of a search. This takes care of food, water, and exercise (when the regime's agents don't appear to be around, life might be almost normal). An Abandoned, Special Place This could be in the upper space of a mall or grocery store, a concert hall (like the Phantom of the Opera), a church, the roof of a hotel. Or it could be a secret garden forgotten between the walls of urban sprawl, or a part of sealed off or re-routed part of the underground (sewer, tunnel, or rail). What is essential is access to food, water, and other basic essentials. These might be foraged in short trips out. Or the hider could be bolder, in plain sight when the authorities appear not to be around. A Church or Embassy Alternatively, the target of the bad regime might petition for and be granted sanctuary in a church or foreign embassy. Especially if the target is a nobody, they might live a somewhat normal life, mindful of the occasional attempt to take him into custody if he leaves the property or is caught alone. This would be a fragile safety, because all concerned understand that the regime could, with enough provocation, throw the ideas of sanctuary aside, and come in force to make an arrest.
