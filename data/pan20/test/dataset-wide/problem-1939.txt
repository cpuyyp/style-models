By invite you, do you mean to say that you expected your boss to pay for it? Or do you mean just an invitation? In either case, why would you not bring it up yourself if you knew about it beforehand? A simple "do you know about XYZ conference? I am thinking of attending and want to check with you whether it would be useful considering I work everyday on topic XYZ. Also, any chance that the company can cover the registration cost?" This seems like an issue that arose only because you wanted your boss to give you a royal invitation... (s)he may have simply forgotten to ask you or it could've just slipped his/her mind. 

After you get a formal offer, look at your start date, look at your salary. Negotiate salary if you need/want to. Negotiate the start date to make sure you have enough time to give your current employer notice and that your new job start won't overlap. I would guess you have about 1 week to do the above. Once you accept your offer, and you get a confirmation, you notify your current employer. If you tell your current employer before accepting a job, you will probably get fired and if your offer falls through, you will be left unemployed. Even if they match the new offer, you are marked as disloyal employee so they will probably start looking for replacement. 

No, in general, it's not. Some candidates really want the job, but are so stressed that they are perceived as unmotivated. Others, well-trained and at ease, will be seen as very motivated, while they have no intention whatsoever to take the job. In a country like France where jobless people risk losing their jobless fee if they don't have enough interviews, the purpose is often to keep the fees, not to get the job. But even more often, it is to take the job(as the pay is better than the fee, usually, much better). The potential employer cannot know. And, of course, many employers are just making marketing for themselves, or sometimes even just trying to get secrets from the candidate(had that once, it's very uncomfortable, once you understand). In other words, motivations are multiple on both sides of the interviews. And you may lose your time in interviews, as much as interviewers know they might be losing their time with you. Or me. When you understand, it's usually very late, typically at the end of the interview, or maybe even after. That being said, going to interviews is always a good idea. Whatever your purpose is. Because being interviewed is a skill. And training on the field is an excellent way to improve that skill. 

I think if your boss is as cool as you describe him, he will surely understand that people change jobs every now and then. And if you really want to go, you will go no matter what he does; he can only make the parting faster and/or sourer. Which he wouldn't like to do if he values you. From his perspective, if you are going to leave, it is still better if you don't stray very far in your new job. Having you in a new role at a partner company with close ties to them can be benefitial to both of you, so this can bring new opportunities to him as well (depending on your role at the new company). So I would just tell what you told here: you are happy with your current job and could continue here, but you got a rare opportunity to fulfill your long term dream. So you hope he will understand this, and (in case you get the new job) you will be more than happy to continue cooperation in your new role, to the mutual benefit of both companies and both of you. 

It is very common for graphists to have that kind of elements in their portfolio. It is commonly thought to be a bad idea for a programmer to include them, at the same time. tradition, habits..... My understanding is that most potential employers want "serious" programmers, and are looking for corporate looking candidates. Another reason is automation. Many recruiters are lazy, and it's easier to automate the parsing of a Word CV than a nice graphical thing. That's the two reasons why noone does it. Though in your specific case, it might be worth looking for a middle ground : a standard CV with nothing graphical for the HR robots to be happy, but with a link to your best graphics. A more efficient HR person would have a look, and be impressed. 

I agree mostly with Carson63000's answer, though in my experience, it's more role-based than size-based. When your main role is to make maintenance of systems used during the day, you've got to be there when people begin to work, and are no more useful once they're back home. In the same firm(a big bank), I've been assigned(at different times of my career) project development & software maintenance tasks. For Project development, noone cared my schedule, as long as I was doing the job. For software maintenance, the requirements were extremely strict : "arrive at 0800, have finished the checkup at 0900 to be sure users can work, stay up to 1700 when the users stop working with the system". Strict schedule was perfectly justified. Though those situations are not that common amongst developpers. But it happens. Happened to me a few times. For freedom, well, if the only thing that matters is that the job is finished, and up to the standards of quality, who cares if you work 0700-1600 or 1100-2000 (or 0700-2000 if you are badly organized)? But it's not freedom to finish when you want. The deliverable is due for the 24th of June, you'd better deliver something that works well the 24th of June. 

Been in this situation before with English, French, Hindi, Punjabi, and Mandarin competing against one another..! It is highly unlikely you will get them to change by simply asking them. Once an enclave is formed, it will stick until something drastic happens around them (e.g. rearrangement of their work desks to be far apart from each other). I would advise that you ask them two more times (a total of 3). If that doesn't change anything (likely), talk to your supervisor about it. Ask him/her to enforce English-only at work rule. There is no magical way to get them to talk in English. You can try and strike up a friendship with two of them individually and then mention in a light-hearted manner that you wish you could speak Telugu to get them to understand. Again, unlikely to work but if you don't want to escalate that's probably your best approach. I would strongly recommend asking your supervisor to establish English-only rule at work place. 

Those that can't take you seriously will not join your company in the first place. But once someone joined, they will most likely be positive about you, to avoid cognitive dissonance if nothing else. Unless you yourself disappoint them, of course. If you introduce yourself to them like you do here, you set extremely high expectations, thus you have to be really really good to live up to your own promise. 

I don't think it matters directly. I.e. I can't imagine any recruiter paying attention to which city you got your experience with technology X in. Your choice has indirect consequences though. In big cities with busy IT life, you obviously have more work opportunities to choose from in the long run, but also fiercer competition. More challenges can help you grow, but can also crush you. Moreover, you have more opportunities to network with like minded people, participate in local user groups etc. which can help improving your skills and career chances if used wisely. However, now in the internet age, you can self study and connect to fellow developers from almost everywhere if you have the determination. And one final point, which may actually be the most important in the long run: career growth and salary are good things, up to a point. But (IMHO) these shouldn't be the sole aim of one's life, rather just means to create and secure the life one desires. So the overall quality of life is important. Making a big career and earning lots of money via spending a large part of your life in a city which is polluted, ugly and hostile may actually make you burn out or even ill in the long run, which, needless to say, breaks your career too. Depending on your preferences, you may very well be better off living in a clean, beautiful and friendly place even if you earn less money and don't get as high promotions as fast. But happiness and satisfaction with your life makes you perform better at work too in the long term. 

All those points will help you establish for a clearer strategy. My first job, well, I was not from the domain, they were hiring in big numbers, so there was no place for negociation at all. I just had to take what they offered. My second job, I was one amongst a few others. I asked slightly over the norm, and nearly got what I asked - but only from one propsective employer. The three other ones did decline my bet. My current job, well, I'm a perfect fit, they had noone else available, and would have lost 6 important months had they not recruited me. I played dirty, and it payed above my own expectations. Because circumstances were favorable. I had the wind in my sails. That's ultimately the thing to gauge : do you have wind in your sails? If not, like for my first job, then shut up and accept whatever misery you are offered. If yes, have fun and negotiate hard. And there are plenty of intermediate positions between those. The more wind you have, the bolder you can be.
