The "margin" is a portion of the selling price. It is defined as $$\text {margin} \equiv \frac {P-C}{P}$$ From the above definition, we see that the margin cannot exceed $100\%$. If one has the cost and he wants to calculate the price in order to have a specific margin, one must calculate $$P(\text {margin}^*) = \frac {C}{1-\text {margin}^*}$$ The first formula written in the question is wrong, because it uses "margin", but it would become correct if instead one used the concept of "markup". The "markup" is defined as the percentage increase of cost in order to determine the selling price: $$\text {markup} \equiv \frac {P-C}{C}$$ It is easy to obtain that the relation between them is $$\text {margin} = \frac {\text {markup}}{1+\text {markup}}$$ 

When the (exogenous) rate of technological change/efficiency is smaller, the corresponding steady-state levels of consumption and capital per unit of effective labor, increase. For capital, we have $$f'(\hat k^*) = \rho + \theta g_x \implies \frac {\partial}{\partial g_x}f'(\hat k^*) = \theta >0$$ So if $g_x \downarrow \implies f'(\hat k^*) \downarrow \implies \hat k^* \uparrow$ due to decreasing marginal product of capital. For steady-state consumption per unit of effective labor we have $$\hat c^* = f(\hat k^*) - (n+g_x)\hat k^*$$ $$\implies \frac {\partial \hat c^*}{\partial g_x}= f'(\hat k^*) \frac {\partial \hat k^*}{\partial g_x} - \hat k^* - (n+g_x) \frac {\partial \hat k^*}{\partial g_x}$$ $$=[f'(\hat k^*) - n - g_x]\cdot \frac {\partial \hat k^*}{\partial g_x} - \hat k^* $$ The term in brackets is assumed positive, i.e. we have already assumed $$f'(\hat k^*) = \rho + \theta g_x > n + g_x \implies \rho > n + (1-\theta)g_x$$ in order to exclude infinite utility. Moreover, evidently $\frac {\partial \hat k^*}{\partial g_x} <0$ so in all $$\frac {\partial \hat c^*}{\partial g_x} <0$$ Therefore, if $g_x \downarrow \implies \hat c^* \uparrow $. See Barro & Martin, ch. 2 page 102, where they discuss the $g_x \uparrow$ case (in p. 101 they discuss the constraint on the parameters). Comment: This result may appear counter-intuitive, but a deeper examination of the model shows that if $g_x$ is lower, utility per capita is lower. Using "consumption per unit of effective labor" is a modeling tactic, what interests us is what happens per individual. So no, the model does not argue in favor of lower productivity/technology. 

The first order condition results in a differential equation in $\beta(x_1)$, $$\left[ x_{1} + \alpha x_{1} + \alpha \frac{N-2}{2} x_{1} - \beta(x_{1})\right] (N-1) - (1 + \gamma) \beta'(x_{1})x_{1} = 0$$ $$\implies (1 + \gamma) x_{1}\beta'(x_{1}) = -(N-1)\beta(x_{1}) + (N-1)\left(1+a \frac{N}{2}\right)x_1$$ or generically $$g(x_1) y' = f_1(x_1)y + f_0(x_1)$$ Where $y \equiv \beta(x_1)$ and the other obvious mappings. This has general solution $$y= \beta(x_1) = C\cdot \exp \{F\} + \exp\{F\}\int \exp\{-F\} \frac{f_0(x_1)}{g(x_1)} dx_1, \;\;\; F\equiv \int \frac{f_1(x_1)}{g(x_1)}dx_1 $$ and doing the work results in $$ \beta(x_1) = \beta(z^*) = Cx_1^{-(N-1)/(1+\gamma)} + \frac{(N \alpha + 2)(N-1)}{2(N + \gamma)}x_1$$ I guess there exists a condition in the model that leads to $C=0$ so that we get the linear expression for the $\beta$ function $$ \beta(z^*) = \frac{(N \alpha + 2)(N-1)}{2(N + \gamma)}x_1$$ Regarding whether $\Pi(z)$ has a global maximum at the stationary point $z^* = x_1$, working the 2nd derivative with respect to $z$, and evaluating it at $z^*=x_1$ is what one can do. Then, if I haven't done any trivial mistake, it appears that a necessary condiiton for the second derivative to be negative at $z^* = x_1$ is that $\alpha(1+\gamma) <1$ and, given this, the condition for a global maximum at $z^*=x_1$is $$N > \frac{2+\gamma}{1-\alpha(1+\gamma)}$$ which appears to put a lower bound in the number of participants in the auction, which I guess is what $N$ measures. But this is the 2nd time I had to guess (and a third guess is that parameters are positive), validating @denesp comment that even though the OP issue is mathematical, providing context and information on what the various symbols stand for, is needed if one is to have a good-quality question to work with. After all, this context is what would make this an economics question and not a math question.

I believe there is a quicker way here. By the inverse function theorem, we have $$y = f(k) \implies k = f^{-1}(y) = f^{-1}[f(k)] \implies \frac {\partial f^{-1}(y)}{\partial y} = \frac {1}{f'(k)}$$ Keeping all these relations in mind, we also have $$\dot y = f'(k)\cdot \big[sf(k) - (n+g+\delta)\cdot f^{-1}(y)\big]$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial \dot y}{\partial y} \bigg|_{y=y^*} = \frac {\partial f'(k^*)}{\partial y}\cdot \big[sf(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)\cdot k^*\big]\\ + f'(k^*)\cdot \left[s - (n+g+\delta)\cdot \frac {1}{f'(k^*)} \right]$$ $$\implies \frac{\partial \dot y}{\partial y} \bigg|_{y=y^*} = 0 + sf'(k^*) - (n+g+\delta)$$ etc 

One possible useful distinction between the two expressions could be as follows: 1) Division of work Assume you have to mail 1.000 letters identical in content to different recipients. For each letter, in order to do that you need to a) fold the letter b) put the letter into the envelope c) write the address d) put a stamp e) go out and put it into the mailbox. Then repeat the sequence 1.000 times. "Division of work" would be to, instead of going through the complete sequence for each letter sequentially, a) fold all letters b) put all letters into the envelope, etc. By performing the same task, you gain efficiency in each task ("learning by doing") and also, you minimize the time needed in between each kind of task/work. Here the focus is on gaining efficiency by grouping tasks. 2) Division of labor In the same example, division of labor would be not only to perform each task for all letters instead of all task for each letter, but have different people doing each task. This situation focuses on the phenomenon of different people specializing in different professions. ...And I am certain that some authors that use the distinction, use the terms switched -namely, they call "division of labor" 1) above, and "division of work" 2). 

"Comparative statics" may refer to two closely related but not identical exercises: a) Regarding a specific equilibrium point, we examine how the properties, associated values etc of it change as we vary the value of an exogenous parameter. b) But also, we can put under "comparative statics" the case where the model has multiple equilibria. Inherently, when more than one equilibria exist, it means that they are dependent on the value of (or inter-relation between) some of the model parameters. Assessing this situation, i.e. contrasting the two solutions, the sets of parameter values for which we obtain the one equilibrium or the other ("values" do not necessarily mean numerical ones -they may be bounds expressed in terms of other parameters etc), understanding the economic essence behind the differences, is a comparison of two static situations. So @Oliv comment below the question is valid, indeed, the initial condition structurally is just one more exogenous parameter of the model. That said, in most cases, dependence (or not) on initial conditions (or "history-dependence" more generally) usually falls under stability analysis: 

The individual has a utility function over consumption and leisure $$U(C, \ell) = U(C, T-L)$$ and to keep this static, it has the no-savings/no-credit budget constraint $$C = G + wL$$ He wants to maximize utility. Inserting the budget constraint into the utility function the first-order condition is (maximizing with respect to $L$) $${\rm (f.o.c)} :\;\; U_c(G+wL, T-L)\cdot w - U_{\ell}(G+wL, T-L) = 0 $$ This will hold in all optimal solutions. Set $L=0$ to express the reservation wage, (i.e. ask "what is the wage consistent with zero work?") $$L=0 \Rightarrow U_c(G, T)\cdot w - U_{\ell}(G, T) =0$$ $$\Rightarrow w_R = \frac {U_{\ell}(G, T)}{U_c(G, T)}$$ Then $${\rm sign} \left\{\frac {\partial w_R}{\partial G}\right\} = {\rm sign} \left\{U_{\ell c}(G, T)\cdot U_c(G, T) - U_{cc}(G, T)\cdot U_{\ell}(G, T)\right\}$$ We see that A) If preferences are assumed separable between consumption and leisure, i.e. if $U_{\ell c} = 0$, then under the usual assumption that $U_{cc} <0$ we see that $\frac {\partial w_R}{\partial G} >0$. B) If separability is not assumed, then it is usually assumed (and reasonably) that $U_{\ell c} >0$, in which case we again obtain $\frac {\partial w_R}{\partial G} >0$. In both cases, an increase in $G$ (which is what happens when the government pays the amount $b$), increases the reservation wage. If we assume that wages are the same before and after the government subsidy, then if the person did not work, he will continue not to work, while if the person worked previously, he may now stop, given the government subsidy. Of course, making the problem dynamic by introducing intertemporal utility maximization and a consumption-savings decision, requires an analysis on its own.
