Yes! The geometric picture is very nice and very easy. It is explained on pages 408-409 of Griffiths-Harris. Here is roughly how it works: Let's work over $\mathbb{C}$ for simplicity. Think of $\mathbb{P}^n$ as being the quotient of $X := \mathbb{C}^{n+1} - 0$ by the action of $\mathbb{C}^\ast$. On $X$ we have the vector fields $d/dx_i$, where the $x_i$ are the standard coordinates on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$. Check that if $v_i$ are linear functionals on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, then the vector field $\sum v_i d/dx_i$ on $X$ descends to a vector field on $\mathbb{P}^n$. The surjection $\mathcal{O}(1)^{n+1} \to \mathcal{T}$ corresponds to taking $n+1$ linear functionals $v_i$ and projecting the vector field $\sum v_i d/dx_i$ down to $\mathbb{P}^n$. The kernel $\mathcal{O}$ corresponds to the vector field $E = \sum_i x_i d/dx_i$. Intuitively, $E$ is a "radial" vector field on $X$, and if you pretend that $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ is a "sphere" in $X$, then $E$ is "normal" to this "sphere", so it vanishes when we project it down. Jonathan Wise gives a nice (and rigorous) explanation of this below. Aside: I think the reason why this is called the Euler sequence is because the vector field $E$ is known as the Euler vector field. And perhaps the reason why $E$ is called the Euler vector field is because its flow is exponential, and $e = 2.718\dots$ is also known as Euler's number. But I'm not sure, and someone should correct me if I'm wrong about this. Edit: Today somebody told me that the relation $E f = d f$ for $f$ a homogeneous degree $d$ polynomial (as in Charles' answer) was discovered by Euler and is known as "Euler's relation". 

Furthermore, I think such an L should be unique up to quasi-isomorphism. Does anyone know a reference for something along these lines? Any other nice examples of cases where this philosophy holds would also be appreciated. 

For a general curve $C$ of genus $g$, it is a fact that the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian $J$ of $C$ is generated by the class $\theta$ corresponding to the divisor $\Theta$. (I am not very strong in algebraic geometry, so I guess that I would rather prefer to work with the probably equivalent statement: The subgroup of $H^2(J;\mathbb{Z})$ generated by first Chern classes of algebraic line bundles on $J$ is generated by $\theta$.) I don't know the proof of this, but the reference seems to be Arbarello-Cornalba-Griffiths-Harris, volume II... So, by the formula you cite, it follows that for any algebraic line bundle $L$ on $J$, the degree of $\alpha_c^\ast L$ must be an integer multiple of $g-1+1=g$. Hence there can be no $L$ such that $\alpha_c^\ast L = \kappa$, since $\kappa$ is of degree $g-1$. Err, hmm, well, actually, if $g=1$ then it's possible, since then $\kappa$ is of degree zero: for example, put $\kappa = \mathcal{O}_C$ and $L = \mathcal{O}_J$, and then we do have $\alpha_c^\ast L = \kappa$. But that's kind of trivial, anyways. At least this all seems to work for a general curve $C$... I have no idea about a curve for which the above statement about the Neron-Severi group doesn't hold. (As for $\kappa \oplus \kappa^{-1}$, this argument doesn't rule out the possibility of an $E$ such that $\alpha_c^\ast E = \kappa \oplus \kappa^{-1}$. But $\kappa \oplus \kappa^{-1}$ is degree zero, so such an $E$ would have to be degree zero...) 

Not sure if I understand your question, but here are some generalities. There is a correspondence between line bundles and divisors (you can find this in any algebraic geometry book). There is a canonical line bundle on any curve -- in the smooth case this is the cotangent bundle, or the sheaf of differentials, or whatever you prefer to call it. In the singular case there is still the dualizing sheaf. Then you get a canonical divisor, namely the one which corresponds to this canonical line bundle. It's easy to find "an actual divisor" of a curve. Divisors on a curve are just formal combinations of points. So find some points of your curve, and voila. Edit: Let me now elucidate a bit. Dan's answer provides a way to identify the canonical line bundle in your situation of interest. The next step is to identify the corresponding divisor (or more precisely, as Rado points out, the class of the divisor). You can do this by writing down any nonzero (meromorphic) differential form, i.e. any nonzero (meromorphic) section of the canonical line bundle, and finding its zeroes and poles (counting multiplicities); then the canonical divisor will be the formal sum of the zeroes minus the formal sum of the poles (counting multiplicities). 

To connect (1) and (3), note that a representation of a group G is the same as a vector bundle over the stack pt/G. I am not sure, but I would guess that (some (but not all?) cases of) (2) follow from (1) by taking (appropriate) Chern classes? 

Deligne's conjecture states that the Hochschild cochain complex of an A-infinity algebra is an algebra over the operad of chains on the topological little discs operad. Of course the conjecture has been proven, but proofs aside -- what are some moral reasons why we should believe in Deligne's conjecture? 

For a power series $f(z) = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i z^i$ with $a_1$ nonzero, Lagrange's inversion formula gives an explicit way to compute the Taylor coefficients of the inverse function. Is there any analogous formula for Laurent series? 

I am looking for some simple and concrete -- but still non-trivial and illustrative -- applications of Atiyah-Bott localization in the context of equivariant cohomology. Do you know any good ones? 

Loop groups (spaces of maps $S^1 \to G$ where $G$ is a Lie group) are nice examples of infinite dimensional manifolds, and they are important in physics and string theory. They have a rich and interesting theory, the basics of which are developed for example in the book "Loop Groups" by Pressley and Segal. See also the paper "Unitary representations of some infinite dimensional groups" by Segal. As for interesting results, there is the recent work of Freed-Hopkins-Teleman which relates the representation theory of the loop group $LG$ ("Verlinde ring") and the twisted equivariant $K$-theory of the Lie group $G$. In general, infinite dimensional things come up often in quantum field theory. For example the fields under consideration might be sections of a vector bundle, or say spaces of maps of surfaces into a manifold. It is important to understand these spaces of fields, because we want to do "integrals" over them. 

Theorem 11 in Section 4.4 of this survey by Dolgushev, Tamarkin, and Tsygan answers my question (2). Theorem 12 kind of addresses my question (3), but the approach there seems to be different from the approach that I am imagining. I am more interested in the Hochschild complex of the derived category. However, I would not be surprised if the Hochschild complex of the derived category of the variety is related to the "sheaf of Hochschild complexes" on the variety, probably the former is the global sections of the latter? 

I am currently trying to learn a bit about Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch... To try to get a better feeling for it, I am looking for examples of nice applications of GRR applied to a proper morphism $X \to Y$ where $Y$ is not a point. I already I know of a fair number of nice applications of HRR, i.e. GRR when $Y$ is a point. I've read through some of the relevant sections of Fulton's Intersection Theory book, but I've only found applications of HRR there, though it's very possible that I overlooked something. I am also interested in seeing worked-out, explicit, concrete examples, with explicit Chow/cohomology classes. Thanks much! 

I think Hatcher's book has a good elementary exposition of some of the differences between homology and cohomology. I believe it's in the introduction to the cohomology chapter. 

The locus of holomorphic line bundles in $Pic_{g-1}(\Sigma)$ with a nontrivial holomorphic section is equivalently characterized as the image of $u_{g-1} : Sym^{g-1} \Sigma \to Pic_{g-1}(\Sigma)$ under the Abel-Jacobi map. In section 4 of chapter 1 of the book of Arbarello-Cornalba-Griffiths-Harris, the theta divisor is defined via the Riemann theta function. Then in the next section, they give a pretty low-tech proof of the fact that the cohomology classes of the theta divisor and of the image of $u_{g-1}$ agree (a special case of the Poincare formula), by reducing to the case where $\Sigma$ is a product of elliptic curves. Finally, they prove Riemann's theorem precisely in the way that you suggest. 

Here is a very rough outline: Take your family $E$ of elliptic curves over $B := \mathbb{C} - \{0,1\}$. Then take the associated "(co)homology bundle" over $B$, whose fibre over $\lambda$ is the (singular) (co)homology of the elliptic curve $E_\lambda$. To be rigorous, the $i$-th cohomology bundle is $R^i \pi_\ast\mathbb{C}$, where $\pi$ is the map $E \to B$ and $\mathbb{C}$ is the constant sheaf (let us work in the analytic topology). Actually to be precise I should say that $R^i\pi_\ast\mathbb{C}$ is a (locally constant) sheaf of $\mathbb{C}$ vector spaces, and the corresponding vector bundle is $R^i\pi_\ast\mathbb{C} \otimes_\mathbb{C} \mathcal{O}\_B$. It is a fact that these cohomology bundles come with flat (Gauss-Manin) connections $\nabla$. One way to see that the vector bundles are flat is to observe that there are integral lattices $R^i\pi_\ast \mathbb{Z} \subset R^i\pi_\ast\mathbb{C}$. Let $\omega$ be a 1-form on the family $E$. Note that the 1st cohomology of an elliptic curve is rank 2, so the cohomology bundle $R^1\pi_\ast \mathbb{C}$ is rank 2, thus if we have 3 sections, then they will be (fiber-wise) linearly dependent. So here are 3 sections: $\omega, \nabla_{d/d\lambda}\omega, (\nabla_{d/d\lambda})^2 \omega$. The Picard-Fuchs equation is essentially just the equation which expresses that these sections are linearly dependent. Your equation involving "$\pi$" (not the same as what I am calling "$\pi$") and its derivatives comes from taking this linear dependence equation and "plugging in" (i.e. integrating along) homology classes extended by parallel transport. The story that I've described above generalizes to arbitrary families of smooth compact varieties. Thomas Riepe's answer explains some of the more classical reasons why we might be interested in period integrals and Picard-Fuchs equations, so let me say a few words about the relation to Gromov-Witten theory. The relation to GW theory arises from mirror symmetry, which is a duality between type IIA and type IIB string theories. One of the reasons why mathematicians first became interested in mirror symmetry was because of the prediction of the physicists Candelas-de la Ossa-Green-Parkes in the early 90s that the genus 0 GW invariants of a quintic threefold (type IIA theory) could be computed via an analysis of period integrals and Picard-Fuchs equations coming from a "mirror" family of Calabi-Yau manifolds (type IIB theory). This is a general principle of mirror symmetry: that GW invariants of certain manifolds can be computed via completely different methods on the "mirror manifold". Usually, studying the mirror manifold is "easier" than trying to study the GW theory of the original manifold directly; although by now our knowledge of GW theory has grown considerably, so this is less true than it used to be. A very nice introductory paper on this material is "Picard-Fuchs equations and mirror maps for hypersurfaces" by David Morrison: $URL$ If you're interested in reading further, you should check out the book "Mirror symmetry and algebraic geometry" by Cox-Katz, which covers all of this material in detail and explains the proofs (due to Givental and Lian-Liu-Yau) of the Candelas-et. al. prediction. 

I am looking for some good references on singularity theory. I'm interested in singularity theory in the context of mirror symmetry, so this means I'm interested in things like Picard-Lefschetz theory, oscillating integrals, Frobenius manifolds (Saito theory). I have looked at the book by Arnold, Gusein-Zade, Varchenko, and I have looked at Seidel's book, but I am wondering if there are any other good, readable, relatively introductory, not-overly-heavy-on-notation books out there. Thanks! 

There are a few comments about this in the notes from Kontsevich's talk at the Arbeitstagung. I also attended the Seidel talk that people are referring to. I should have my notes somewhere; if I succeed in finding them and if they contain anything not already in Sheel Ganatra's notes, I'll scan them and post them. Edit: Kontsevich spoke about this last week in Miami. Check out these notes from the talk. Find the abstract here. 

One reason is Givental's conjecture, which says that in the semisimple case, genus 0 GW invariants determine higher genus GW invariants. See this paper of Teleman, in which the conjecture is proved. The theory of Frobenius manifolds in general is quite complicated. I guess semisimple Frobenius manifolds form a relatively tractable set of examples. Here are some basic references for the theory of semisimple Frobenius manifolds: 

Here is a really nice collection of essays by mathematicians at the IHES: The unravelers: mathematical snapshots 

Some years ago I read the paper "Computing over the Reals, Where Turing Meets Newton" by Lenore Blum, in which this question and related questions ("transfer results") are addressed: $URL$ 

Ok, so I finally spent some time looking through some papers of van den Bergh and Lowen in more detail, which is probably what I should have done a while ago. The first relevant paper to my questions is probably the paper that javier had originally posted, on deformations of abelian categories: $URL$ Then there is a sequel paper $URL$ which claims to explain how Hochschild cohomology is related to deformations of abelian categories! This looks to be exactly what I wanted, or at least close enough... However, this paper does not seem to have any concrete examples... There are other papers of van den Bergh and Lowen that are probably relevant and that I should probably look at further... 

It depends on what you mean by "visualize"... For things like properness, separatedness, finiteness, smoothness, fiber products, tangent vectors, etc., I usually found it helpful to first understand the analogous things for sets and/or (real, differentiable) manifolds. But if you do this, you have to also keep in mind that the situation for schemes is usually more subtle than the situation for sets and manifolds; while the situations are analogous, they are sometimes not exactly analogous. Another issue is that you might not always know what the appropriate differential geometry analogues of many algebraic geometry concepts are; they're not always spelled out in commonly used books like Hartshorne. For example, I spent a very long time being totally confused by the valuative criterion for properness and could never remember the statement --- until I realized that properness corresponds to compactness in differential geometry, and that the valuative criterion is roughly analogous to sequential compactness (which is equivalent to compactness, for metric spaces, e.g. manifolds) in general topology. Another thing that I find helpful is to first understand things in the complex setting before moving to the general setting. For example, complex varieties are examples of complex manifolds; complex curves are just Riemann surfaces. The best way, in my opinion, to get a basic handle on for instance finite morphisms is to understand what they are in the case of complex curves: they are branched covers of Riemann surfaces. 

My advice: spend a lot of time going to seminars (and conferences/workshops, if possible) and reading papers. Talk to people, read blogs, subscribe to the arxiv AG feed, etc. AG is a very large field, so look around and see what's out there in terms of current research. There's a huge variety of stuff. There's a lot of "classical" stuff, and there's also a lot of cool "modern" stuff that relates to physics and to topology (e.g. Gromov-Witten theory, derived algebraic geometry). First find something more specific that you're interested in, and then try to learn the background that's needed. 

If I remember correctly, the proof of homotopy invariance of singular homology (at least the one in Hatcher) involves cutting a (simplex)x(interval) into simplices, which perhaps can be confusing. In cubical singular homology you'd just have to cut a (cube)x(interval) into cubes, which is obvious. This sort of thing maybe also comes up in other basic results that involve homotopies, such as (graded-)commutativity of cup product. It doesn't really matter, since as you say, you get the same results at the end of the day. But perhaps in some sense simplices are more "basic" than cubes, since you can easily cut cubes (or any other polyhedron) into simplices, but you can't cut simplices into (finitely many) cubes or even "rectangle-ubes". As for Ilya's answer, I actually don't think that cubes would necessarily complicate higher category theory stuff that much. It might even make certain things easier. Simplices are just a nice formalism with which to describe things like homotopies, and higher homotopies, and so forth. For example, if you have maps f, g, h such that (f compose g) and h are homotopic, you can think of the homotopy as being a triangle filling in the appropriate diagram. However, suppose you just have maps f and g that are homotopic. Then the homotopy is a "triangle" with a "degenerate" edge filling in the appropriate diagram. So simplices are not perfect either, we still need to allow for "degenerate" situations. In that case, we could have just started with cubes, allowing degenerate edges, to begin with...
