The verbal slight of hand here is that newspapers or cats are comparable to money. The basic reason that "we" find the latter to be desirable is that money is more useful than cats or newspapers. Even someone who loves cats will be eventually find that for each additional cat they purchase or acquire their desire to have an additional cat diminishes. This is called marginal utility. Someone who collects news papers actually may have a pathological problem with their collection. News papers are generally only useful once, or shortly after they were printed. The have reducing utility for each passing they they are collected and take up time and space to store appropriately. In rare cases, some newspapers and cats can hold value to others. However, typically they are not exchangeable and so they only provide utility to those who have some kind of attachment to them. Cats and newspapers are also not easily fungible. With currency, you can have smaller units. So you could purchase an item for 10 cents with a dollar and still keep the portion that you did not spend. This is very difficult if you are trying to exchange for goods or services with a cat. Similarly, newspapers are not easily convertible. While they may have a high utility to someone, they do not have much utility to other people. Money, on the other hand, is useful because, typically, it is something that is both fungible and convertible. According to the APA: 

This seems obvious. If $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$ are in the joint support of $s_1,s_2$ and $\tau$ is not, then (writing $P$ for the first player's payoff) you need $$P(\tau,s)\le P(\sigma_1,s)=P(\sigma_2,s)$$ where $s$ is a convex combination of the $s_i$. But if you replace $s$ with $s_1$ or $s_2$, this holds, so it still holds after you average over $s_1$ and $s_2$. What am I missing? 

Yesterday I promised my wife that if she would do the dishes, I would sweep the floor. Five minutes earlier, my promise didn't exist. I created it myself. Does that strike you as unhealthy or bound to implode and cause mayhem? 

I'm adding this as a separate answer because it's quite independent of my other answer. We've agreed that if there are X dollars existing and you counterfeit Y dollars, then you've stolen Y/(X+Y) of the value of those X dollars. This assumes you do your counterfeiting all at once, and without warning. If instead you do your counterfeiting slowly over time, or if it can be anticipated, then there's an additional effect: people try to rid themselves of money holdings in order to avoid being stolen from. (That is, they try to trade dollars for goods before the dollars lose value.) This is costly to the moneyholders, with no offsetting benefit to anyone. One way to see that it's costly to moneyholders is that they now own less money, which makes their lives less convenient. A different way to see that it's costly to the moneyholders is that the rush to trade money for goods bids up prices, which lowers the value of money. (These are not two different costs; they are two different ways to think about the same cost.) So in this case, you have stolen more than Y/(X+Y) of the value of originally existing money, but kept somewhat less (because by the time you get to spend your dollars, they're worth less than dollars were worth at the outset). The difference between what you steal and what you keep simply dissipates. 

Or put another way, pathological hoarding is only the lack of action to spend money, not the collection of it. Further, people who have a lot of wealth generally do not have a lot of cash, per se. The people on the cover of Fortune, as the quote mentions, have large holdings of companies. And what cash they do have, the bank turns around and invests the money themselves, such that money is rarely sitting in a vault somewhere being hoarded. When they invest their wealth, their value is derived from their holdings. When we say someone is worth $x million/billion dollars we are saying how much money you could get by selling all of their ownership and converting it to cash by selling it. Ownership of a company is less convertible than money, though still more convertible than cats. If you sell several million shares of a company, the price will probably go down because of the additional quantity supplied. When the price goes down, the value of the company goes down. This means there is less money for the company to spend on increasing supply (often by hiring workers), diversifying their products, or acquiring better facilities. So even when someone has a lot of wealth, they probably are spending the money (not hoarding it) but they ae spending it in ways that also have high marginal value for themselves. People who have pathological hoarding collect things with negative marginal value, like cats. Tl;dr, the FaceBook response should probably be: "Because money is more useful than cats." 

The old monetary equation is MV=PT, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and T is the amount of transactions. The fear in this case is that M will remain fixed. In a growing economy, T, the level of economic activity, will rise. Then, to make the equation hold, one of two things must happen: 1) V must rise to compensate for the rise in T, or 2) the price level must fall to compensate for the rise in T, to hold PT constant with M times V, both of which we're assuming remain constant. A rise in V can be caused in improvements in money management; banking, ATM cards, smart phone payments etc. That, in fact, is a large part of what has driven economic growth in the past 50 years. The other possibility, a fall in P, is what scares people. It's called deflation, and represents "sticker shock." Imagine a world in which prices were going down 3% every year, because the economy was growing 3% a year. Your wages would fall 3% a year. You shouldn't worry because your costs are also falling 3% a year, or more (but you will). There will be "reverse" millionaires," people who used to be millionaires, who aren't any longer, but who are better off because prices have fallen faster than their nominal wealth. It would be a strange, funky world, which is why policy makers avoid it, to the extent of making the "opposite" mistake of allowing inflation. Which may be one reason that the Bitcoin experiment is not viewed favorably by central banks. 

Assuming a fixed housing stock, it's not hard to show that an increase in salaries drives up rents enough to make renters worse off if and only if housing is a Giffen good. 

So, is it correct to say that in an economy with X currency units, counterfeiting and spending Y fake units is equal to theft of Y/(X+Y) of the wealth of the economy? (Emphasis added.) No. It is correct to say that spending Y fake units is equal to the theft of Y/(X+Y) of the money holdings of the economy, which is not at all the same thing. 

Your marginal rate of substitution between (say) eggs and wine is the number of eggs you'd be willing to trade for one additional bottle of wine. This marginal rate of substitution can reflect your preferences (if you're a consumer) or the state of technology (if you're a producer who can, for example, substitute three eggs for one wine in your production process). Suppose your MRS is three eggs per wine and my MRS is two eggs per wine. Then there's an opportunity for a mutually beneficial trade: You give me two and a half eggs, and I'll give you a wine. You thought the wine was worth three eggs, and you got it for two and a half --- that's a win. I thought the wine was worth two eggs, and I sold it for two and a half --- that's also a win. Whenever your MRS differs from my MRS, there's an opportunity for a mutually beneficial trade. Therefore, if our MRS's differ, it means that an opportunity for mutually beneficial trade has been missed. So in order for resources to be used efficiently --- that is, in such a way that all opportunities for mutually beneficial trade have been exploited --- the MRS between any two commodities must be the same for you as it is for me or anyone else, regardless of how we're using those resources.
