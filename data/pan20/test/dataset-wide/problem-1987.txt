Ideally (but not always) anyone reviewing your resume should be looking at the work description and not just titles. Since an HR person is looking at your resume, it would seem you got past any buzzword filter. I would guess that your description of your work over the phone gave a better picture of what you have been doing than your resume did. Titles change from company to company and really have no correlation. Even if you had "Senior" in your title, senior means different things to different companies. FWIW, if you just looked at my 25 year job history by title only, it would approximate a sine wave of responsibility. That has never been a problem for me in looking for a job. I would stay away from mis-representing simple verifiable facts like job title, this could really blow up on you. For my company, that is one of the few things that would actually be verified if someone in HR called for a reference. 

I wouldn't include a statement like that in either section. It means nothing and will likely be ignored. In both the cover letter and CV, include things that are tangible and valuable, anything else is just window dressing. As a resume reviewer, I want to see things that give me a demonstrable reason to believe you will be successful. Instead of saying "I have a desire for learning and looking into the future", point to things in your CV which demonstrate that you have taken actions to learn new things and work with new technologies. I will determine from those items that you really do want to learn and look to the future. You can say all the nice things you want, but remember the old saying "Actions speak louder than words." 

There is no definition of what sections should be in a resume and what should be in those sections. As a hiring manager, I expect your resume to tell me the story of who you are and what value you can provide to my organization. I have seen many different styles and I'm sure that some of the styles I didn't care for, others would have really liked. The most important thing is that you can convey to the reader why they should be giving you more time to talk to you about how good a fit you are for their job. The one requirement i have: don't make it a work of fiction. 

As with most salary discussions, you need to make this about the value you provide and not about what is happening with someone else. However, I think full-timers could just as easily say that they should be getting a better hourly rate based on their larger commitment to the company, and that this adjustment is overdue. In general, you should not compare yourself to others who are in a different situation. Unless there is a law that says part-timers must be paid at the same rate as full-timers (which I doubt, but maybe) there is no reason to assume that the company must or will treat you the same. 

While not universally true, I have found that people are generally paid what they are worth. The problem for you(us) is that the company gets to evaluate that worth. Understand that your goals and the company's goals won't necessarily align and when it comes to the bottom line, they will make decisions based on theirs. In some ways work is a competition. If you want to get paid more, you need to produce more. You don't necessarily have to work more hours to do it, but at the end of the day, you need to have shown that you are more valuable than the people around you, whether that is inside your company or against industry norms. Being happy at work requires effort and decisions on your part. What are you willing to do to get to that happy point? The company doesn't hold the responsibility for your happiness. If you want to work less, then you need to be prepared to be compensated less. If you care about the size/makeup of the company, you need to balance that with your other desires. Their are plenty of places you can be happy and plenty of places you can be unhappy. You just need to understand all of the players in the game and what you can control. 

I think you need to make the effort to reach out to them to restart the discussion. I understand your thought process and I agree with you regarding withholding the info. As mentioned across the other answers, you should make this discussion about your value to them, not your previous compensation from someone else. However, I think the last line of your last response may have pushed them away. I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't react well to you turning their words back on them like you did, "If you do not want to proceed further, please let me know asap." They may have interpreted this as more attitude than they want to deal with. There's nothing wrong with countering the discussion, but choice of words matters. When negotiating, how you say something can be more important than what you say. 

It doesn't appear this way to me. This employee is clearly not delivering results, or we wouldn't be answering your question. While you may have great respect for his ability, potential only will get you so far. These are the hard parts of being a manager, but you need to hold all of your team to the standard of delivering results. By not holding this developer to that standard, you are sending a message to the other developers that they don't need to deliver results. 

As a hiring manager, I am trying to evaluate whether you can help me solve the problems I face with my system. I need to know what you bring to the table and that is demonstrated by the what and how of your efforts. It's amazing how many resumes I read that are pages long and don't tell me a single thing about what the candidate actually did. Lots of liaising and communicating and collaborating on some really awesome systems and yet not a single detail about a specific problem the candidate solved. I really do want to hire someone, help me see that you are the best candidate out there. 

Presumably, your freelance customers are going to use your product(web-site, app, ...) during normal business hours. Your boss and company management are going to need an acceptable answer to this question: What will you do when a external customer reaches out to you during the working day? Your full-time employer has every right to expect you to work 100% for them during the working day. You should not be taking calls, answering emails or even spending time thinking about your external clients during the work day. You need to make sure that your freelance customers understand this and don't try to reach you when you are at work. If not, this experiment will fail quickly. 

Doesn't sound quite fair to me. If they agreed to less hours per week and the commensurate reduction in pay, they should have expected less work per week. This is something that should have been part of the discussion with your boss and HR when the accommodations were being made. I would suggest that you discuss that with your manager and HR together. Unfortunately, the fact that a new opening has been posted may mean your fate has already been sealed. 

What do you have to show from taking these courses? Was there a test or evaluation at the end which certifies that you took and passed the course? Have you built some projects using those technologies? Recruiters are looking for something concrete. Getting a university degree in a certain discipline carries with it the weight of the institution. If you are self-taught via online courses and you can demonstrate work (employed or on your own) based on that coursework, that also carries weight. If all you can say is that you have taken some courses, that isn't likely to get you very far. It may get your resume past the buzz-word filters, but the first qualified reviewer to take a look at it is likely to pull the plug. 

Communication is an important part of any job. These people are giving you a sample of their communication skills at a time when you can expect that they should be doing their best job. I take the same view of cover letters and resumes, if your communication skills come across poorly in either one, that is a strike against you. You may still get further in the hiring process, but this is part of the entire evaluation. If the candidate can not manage to do a good job when their own best interests are in play, how much can I expect from them as an employee. The cover letter should be trying to sell the candidate and I don't think it is unreasonable at all to include that in your evaluation. 

The time to leave is when you have honed your skills well enough that some other company will offer you that job at a higher salary. This is a supply and demand market, when you have improved yourself and your value well enough you will be able to get the job you are describing. If you are already motivated to move on, go ahead and start looking for a job. The market will tell you soon enough how much you are worth. If you are not getting any interviews, then you (or your resume) are not close to ready for the next level. If you are getting interviews but no offers, then learn from the interviews what areas you need to improve and work on them. Without knowing a location, it's hard to know your market for sure. Many moderately or heavily populated areas have healthy amount of software jobs available, so if you are in one of those areas, the opportunities will be there when you have proven your worth. 

I'm assuming you are talking about a "Skills" or similar section of your resume. I would not limit the list based on the specifics of a job, because the set of tools you will use in your job is not static and those other languages may be valuable. When I am reading a resume and see something listed in "Skills", I expect you to be able to be productive with that tool or language on day 1 of your job. I am more than willing to let developers learn new languages on the job, but if you are going to list it, I expect you to already know it. 

You should certainly push back on anything you don't feel comfortable with, at minimum by asking why it is needed or potentially why it is needed now. But you should also be aware that a fair amount of "sensitive" information will be needed by most employers before they offer you a job. If you aren't willing to provide it, they are free to move on and end your application process. 

I am not sure that it would be all that efficient to have all of the engineers involved in the planning, but certainly having multiple voices involved can help make a better plan. As to it not being your responsibility. If your team is going to be responsible for building and supporting that system in the future, then it is your responsibility to learn the new architecture and tech stack. You shouldn't wait to the the day before you start working on it to get the details, as some parts of it may need time for consideration to get comfortable. 

As it applies to being CTO, there are no specific requirements. However you may have a bigger problem, your visa status. You are going to need a Visa to come to the US. In one of the comments you mention applying to go to Stanford, which would require a student visa. If you come here to work, it would be a different visa, possibly H-1B. Currently, the burden for approval of a working visa is probably higher than a student visa, but if you took the easier path of a student visa and then worked for your start-up, you could have legal issues. You need to make sure you have your visa issues sorted out and are allowed to work in the US, then you can worry about being CTO. You may need to talk to an immigration lawyer in the US.
