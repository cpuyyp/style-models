Dedication and determination.......as long as you have those, everything else become tough, but do-able. I'm not sure of your financial resources, but would recommend joining a local gym, finding a personal trainer to start you on a program and getting involved in some local self-help groups for smoking and drinking (even though it doesn't sound like you drink excessively). Find out what will motivate you over the long term and keep you active. It could be a sport you want to participate in, camping, cycling, etc....but something that really interests you that will make the steps you're taking with exercising, etc. more meaningful. good luck 

I couldn't find any direct information about what the difference between short/full motion pushups, but what I did find ($URL$ ties directly with what you state, the shorter the range, the more you can do, OR, to give the major difference, the short the motion the more you NEED to do to achieve the same affect. In doing short-top (just the finishing top portion), short-bottom and full range myself, I found that the top-finishing motion utilizes more of the delts and chest muscles, the short-starting (bottom) utilizes the tricep and lats more....so, by doing short range top motion alone seems to reduce which muscle groups are being worked. 

I just failed a 455lb dead lift, tried to down scale to a 405lb which I've been able to pull 5 of previously and failed at that too. How long do I rest prior to reattempting a previous max (405lb at 5 reps) and then reattempt the 455 level lift? Is it a week? or more? or less? 

I think you answered the question by properly asking it. Don't go to failure. Should you be cautious about benching? YES, I think this is the exercise where people actually get hurt the most, by the bar dropping on them (chest or much worse the throat). I would recommend using barbell in the beginning of your routine and as you get tired, moving to dumbbells. This will give you the experience in using barbell training and the ability to push it with reduced risk of injury using dumbbells. I workout alone (home gym) and had two experiences where I couldn't lift the bar off of me...dumping to the side (as Dave mentioned above) is the option, you can also purchase safety stands. 

The flat and inclined bench press are the best for chest development. What you might be looking for is a program that provides the volume required to push your muscles into growth. Typically, a 5x5 program focuses more on strength and a 3x8 program more on size. The amount of weight used and number of time a week you're lifting is also a factor. If you're your current routine is within your 'comfort zone', then you need to look to get out of it and either push more weight OR more often. 

The bench press focuses on the pecs primarily (depending on the elbow position) and secondarily on the triceps and delts. 

Typically you should be able to deadlift more than you squat BUT there are many reasons why you wouldn't be: 

What ever you do buy - buy quality, but buy cheap (look on craigslist or garage sales or ask friends). I would recommend a weight bench and dumbbells. With those two items you can create a significant workout routine that will keep you going for a year or so. Make sure the bench is good/sturdy (I always look on amazon for reviews) and for the dumbbells, keep them simple (pic below), don't get the dial-in adjusting ones. In total (for these two items) you'll probably spend under $90. So - steps to take: 1 - buy the books and read them 2 - get a good bench and dumbbells 3 - build a simple plan and stick to it - if you train 2-3 times a week OR 3-4 hours a week over multiple training times 4 - stay at it for 3-6 weeks min. and evaluate where you are and if you're making progress. Best of luck to you, what you're doing is amazing. 

I think the base idea of burning more calories than consuming is correct - however, think about all the factors involved in actually determining both. What you burn is largely a factor of your metabolism AND if you metabolism is not near average - the avg calories burned based on your rest burn rate and exercise burn rate could dramatically be off. By reducing your intake drastically, your body could be in 'starvation' mode - reducing to overall rest and exercise calories burn rate THIS is the reason why people who 'crash' diet/exercise don't lose weight quickly....basically, you're putting your body into shock instead of ramping down. Here's a good article on determining how many calories your body needs daily: $URL$ My recommendation: 

I would recommend looking into isometric exercises, simulating weight ones. You can take hold to the bottom of a couch or door jam and pull (simulating a row) and focus on the tension. Same thing with shrugs and pull ups, you don't need to come off the ground to put tension on the traps. 

Sometimes 1/2 day to a day after a tough workout, when I lean forward, I get a severe cramping in my chest...it feels like a bad muscle cramp in my ribs (just above the sternum on the right hand side). What is my body trying to tell me? and how can I stretch to stop this from happening? 

I'm not sure why you mentioned that you don't want to 'directly' lose weight? if that's what your goal is, then directly do it......... 

I had the same issue about 2 years ago, some of it is as you stated - fitness level. I would recommend adding vita-water mix in while working out - I found drinking vitawater (I use the powder form) added significantly to the reduction of post workout fatigue. Another suggestion would be to ramp up when you've been away from a steady exercise routine instead of jumping in the deep end and pushing a one hour workout. 

From what I can find regarding the book 'The No Sweat Exercise Plan: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, and Live Longer', it is focused on better eating and doing some moderate amount of exercising - better eating then you are now and more exercising then you are currently doing. Both combined will provide a weight loss plan that is effective. As with any other 'no sweat' plan, the focus is on people who currently are not eating healthy and do no (or very little) exercising....for that community of people, anything works, for a time. Your question: Does it matter what exercise for health/weight loss - yes and the book has the same advice in it regarding this (there seems to be one section in a book where high metobolism type exercise is recommended - such as jogging, which does cause most people to sweat..). The more you push yourself, the more benefit you will receive. My recommendation is to set some goals for yourself and based on your available time and resources develop a plan to meet those goals. I'm confident that a solid weight lifting program will provide most people with weight loss and basic strength that we all need. If your goal is to get in to an Iron Man competition, then endurance training is best. Simple weight loss? plan a diet you can live with and walk 1/2 hr a day.....so, step one: set some goals...list them here and lets see what we can do to help 

Here's a link to the Library of Medicine article discussing the effectiveness. Yes, it's a form of HIIT, the basic idea is 8 - 20 second intervals followed by 10 seconds of rest. Is it effective? the studies performed have shown it to be and I can tell you from first hand experience that it's the most effective program I've used to build endurance and loss weight (real weight, not just temp water weight). Like any other program, you get out of it what you put into it. You need to push the intensity of each exercise as much as you can and limit the rest periods between the exercises. You can apply the Tabata protocol to any body weight or light weight (including kettlebell) routines you have. Here's the link to the Ross Training article again: $URL$ - worth reading a few times. Here's a link to an interval timer I use: $URL$ (you can also download iPhone timers). Apply it to heavy bag training, running, kettlebells and you will be very happy with the results. 

Here's a great article describing your symptoms, how to test and steps to take to correct: $URL$ I think the # 1 point is (from the article) Get the right diagnosis...without that, you don't really know what it is. I would have suggested against using any kind of wrist support, since long term it's not 'fixing' the problem and only building the surrounding muscles, tendons, etc. - which would result in the wrist/forearm being even that much of the weaker link in the chain. The old advice of - if it hurts don't do it - is spot on - with the complete advice I would give, stop doing it until you know how to correct the problem so you can continue building your entire body correctly. Bad technique, to much focus on some weak area, not fixing the root cause will results in not having long term enjoyment because you're potentially doing long term damage. I'm not sure how old you are, but I can tell you from direct experience - it all catches up to you. 

It seems obvious that it's related to the squats, since the pain starts after that and the only non-body weight exercise you're doing are squats. I would have someone check your form either in person or via video (you can post a link here). Look at doing some body weight or goblet squats (light weight) to help with your form, here's a link to goblet squats: $URL$ Einstein: Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Read more: $URL$ 

It could be a number of things and various ways to approach it. I had a similar problem due to leaning forward to much, so instead of standard squats, I first focused on front squats (weight in the front - either barbell or dumbbells) and also picking my toes up. This helped me feel how my body should be for standard squats. I also spread my feet out a bit and pointed my toes out a bit once I started standard squats. 

Keep them off the ground with some wooden shipping crates or strips of wood and cover them with a tarp. If you're not going to use them for an extended period, spray them down with oil (WD-40). Keep the bars inside......when then weather gets better, iron brush the plates down and clean them up with rustoleum. Snow will cover the outer layer of the tarp and not creep up underneath if you have it tied down or tucked under (to stop the wind blowing it up). Don't pack them away to good or you won't use them if the effort to unpack/pack them is to much - nothing like a crisp winter day to lift. 

Here's a link to Ross Training for excellent hand/wrist/forearm exercises: $URL$ The wrist is mostly bone, but by building up the hands/forearm, the wrist will get stronger (and look more proportionate). Go for strength and functionality and don't focus on any one body part, this is the road that will drive you crazy... 

I was just reading an article on this last night in PowerLifter magazine. On avg., every 10 lbs of new weight adds at min. 4lbs of muscle (for those who do not train at all). So, just adding weight adds strength. The article also listed the lifts from the most to least technical - Bench Pressing being the least 'technical' and dead lifting the most with squatting in the middle...so, some of the lifts could be impacted by the extra weight but not all - and many competitions take the total of the 3 lifts as the determining factor of who wins (total lbs lifted in all lifts). Is it healthy? no 

Can you over use foam rolling? what are the negative impacts? I'm using it 3x a week post weight routines. Has anyone had any negative experiences? 

@Joshua - I read your question, your updates, the response (I completely agree with Dave and Berin) and kept coming back to your #'s. It seems your out of balance between the different lifts and being 200lbs + the bench is far below where it should be - especially based on your systematic approach, focused diet, etc. What is missing from your information is: what part of the bench press is the biggest sticking point, what accessory bench exercises are you doing (narrow grip? band/chain presses, etc.) - it sounds very much like a technical/execution issue and/or specific muscle group lacking....the interesting thing is your row is lacking also....could it be a weakness in your upper back muscle chain? Lats/Delts? Do you do dips/pull ups? any issues there? Here's a few articles that might help - Pressing Power: $URL$ How to blast through your weakest link!: $URL$ Don't move away from the great progression you're making, but don't get caught up in any one program. I'm a firm believer of the 5x5 Rippitoe, but also deviate to keep things interesting and see what others do and how I can incorporate different (new to me) ideas. One of the better bench accessory exercises I do is swinging the sledge hammer...why does it help? I think it helps with the explosive power and lat work...good luck 

Above is a good starting point - a stability ball squat, it helps you get the feel for the right form. So, when it comes to any exercise, technique first and then add weight. If you can't do the exercise correct, adding weight will most likely cause injury and stop you from achieving any long term goals... 

Short term programs and diets often lead you back to where you were - or worse. I would recommend finding a sport/activity that you would be interested in long term and setting your goals to be good at that (golf, volleyball, swimming, hiking, etc.). You can alternatively focus on the results you're seeing/feeling now and imagine what it would be to keep/improve on those - I don't know if that would be enough to keep you going long term...but every person has different motivating points. I think the key to any successful, positive change is realizing that there will be a life style change (diet, time for exercising, etc.) - but it's a positive change. 

If both people are looking for the same results, than the workout plan (short/long term) will probably look about the same - given everything being equal. The difference will be in the weights used, intensity, etc. expected from each. For example, if the focus is on boxing and the goal to be more explosive - then both will probably incorporate both plyrometric and explosive weight training (cleans, etc.) - the difference in the jumps heights and weights used for each. 

Take a look at LiveStrong (Lance Armstrong's site) @ www.livestrong.com and Body Building at www.bodybuilding.com 

I'm still using universal weights (one day I'll move onto Olympic) and at most 25lb plates. This results in the bar being lower to the ground when performing dead lifts. I know dead lifters change height of the bar (using platforms, rack mounts, etc.) when training...so my question is: what is the optimal height of the bar to get the most benefit from dead lifting and what does a lower OR higher bar benefit? I'm at about 320lbs x 5 reps max right now - 400lbs+ via a rack (actually cement blocks). 

My max deadlift (for now) is 435lbs, my above knee max rack lift is 605lbs, my just below knee max rack lift is 450lbs....does this indicate that my 'take off' is the weak part of the lift? and if so, what can I do to improve the bottom part of my dead lift? 

What actually gives out after 20? Your wind? your triceps? Most likely, you've programmed yourself mentally to stop at 20 - push one more out and see what happens. The big question is, what are you driving towards - if you hit 30 or 50, then what? It sounds like you're a bit overweight - I would recommend putting a complete diet/workout plan together and setting up monthly measures (weight, exercise intensity, etc.) to measure your progress. Keep pushing yourself - you can always do one more. 

Here's a good link to some curl variations and a pic of the muscles being worked on:$URL$ In plan language (from what I understand) the palm down works more of the forearm in addition to the bicep, the hammer (neutral) a more even split of stress on forearm and bicep and the traditional curl mostly the bicep. (much like pull ups and chin ups). 

Based on the comment you added to your question: that you will be switching gyms in Jan (one month away) - I would recommend that you do preparation work prior to Starting Strength - in other words, start it right at the new gym and use this time to prepare your form. Grab a broom handle or pvc pipe, review the SS book and videos and start practicing your squats, deadlifts, presses, etc. Here's one video to start with: $URL$ I'm not sure what you do have available at your current gym, but focus on core and interval training (HITT/Tabata) so you're endurance is in condition.
