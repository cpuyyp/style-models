Lots of creatures climb, few creatures create and regularly use tools. Fewer still if you want human level dexterity in the hands. Options 

Again a lot depends on the scenario, but at the very least it will be harder to get started. A gun gives you a quick easy kill. Without it you have to rely on traps or something similar to get meat which is going to take more time than shooting a deer and eating it. 

These super humans would not be granted the same freedoms as everyday people. Using the United States military as an example, you do face restrictions (and these for your average mechanic or what have you.) 

Well..ego I guess? This is sort of story driven but we can look back a military mistakes and it doesn't take long to realize they aren't all that uncommon. Picket's Charge, The Maginot Line, Thermopylae. Human ignorance/arrogance is the most likely culprit in this scenario. Often the loser in a war is the side that holds on to the past truths of warfare for too long and doesn't adjust to new realities in mobility, communication and weapons technology. 

Sefa's answer is correct. Due to Newton's shell theorem, the force on any object inside (and due to) a spherically symmetric object of uniform mass density of exactly zero. The exact integration (see e.g. Wikipedia or these notes) is messy, but it indeed relies on the density of the shell, $\rho$. Now, if we give the shell non-uniform density, then there will indeed be a net gravitational pull on the "planet" inside it. We can compute the force on this planet by computing the potential in any location inside the shell. Basically, if we assume that $\rho=\rho(r,\theta,\phi)$ (in spherical coordinates), we can solve the equation using spherical harmonics (where the factor of $\epsilon_0^{-1}$, used in electrostatics problems, is replaced with the appropriate set of gravitational constants). This is not easy to solve analytically; numerical solutions are often better. Also - and I don't normally say this - there's a point at which you have to consider if this much effort is worth it to solve a worldbuilding problem. Odds are good that the mass density will be roughly spherically symmetric, as will the shell, and so the "planet" inside will feel very little force. 

To take a more practical slant on things. For each species identify what they actually need clothes for. Think about the biology, the environment and the histories and traditions of that race. Example 1 For example a scaled swamp-living lizardman might have no need for clothes for warmth or protection (and they wouldn't last long in a swamp anyway), however they do need to carry things. In that case you can expect them to develop harnesses, pouches, backpacks etc but not actually clothes as we think of them. Modesty would never exist as a concept, and adornment would be approached by decorating the harnesses. Example 2 Desert dwelling nomads - not sun adapted. In this case clothing is needed for protection. Social taboos may well develop to reinforce that need for clothing so modesty may or may not exist. Clothing would probably look similar to that developed by desert cultures in our world. Example 3 Desert dwelling camel-riding nomads - sun adapted. In this case clothing is not needed for protection from the sun, but they may well carry face masks to protect themselves from sand. Carrying things is normally done by putting it on the camels so for the most part they don't need much in the way of bags, harnesses, etc except to carry things they need frequent access to. Conclusion I hope this helps you see how you can break down each race and its environment to see what it's actual requirements are. From those requirements you can then work out and see what they need - and from there draw conclusions about where/if they would adorn things and whether they would develop a modesty taboo or not. The need for clothing outdoors doesn't automatically lead to a modesty taboo of course - and even a race that doesn't need clothing may still develop one. That could be an interesting part of that races back story though. For example perhaps a primitive race that doesn't need clothes had an encounter with a race that does need clothes. They saw the more advanced technology of the other race and decided to copy it, including the clothes... 

Maybe. Giant cells actually exist. They occur when many cells fuse together, often to fight an infection. They typically reach a maximum size of 120 micrometers - nowhere near your size - but I suggest that it might be possible in an extreme case. Potential reasons for the formation of a giant cell of bacteria: 

Not much. I assume that by "14% less gravity" you mean that at the surface, the force of gravity is only 0.86 times its strength on Earth's surface. This means that either the radius must be greater or the mass must be smaller. However, you say that the size is 46.7 times the size of Earth. Doing some algebra, $$V_{\text{planet}}=46.7V_{\text{Earth}}\to\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\text{planet}}^3=46.7\times\frac{4}{3}\pi r_{\text{Earth}}^3$$ $$r_{\text{planet}}=\sqrt[3]{46.7}r_{\text{Earth}}\approx 3.6r_{\text{Earth}}$$ Taking the surface gravity requirement, $$\frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{r_{\text{planet}}^2}=\frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{(3.6r_{\text{Earth}})^2}=0.86\frac{M_{\text{Earth}}}{r_{\text{Earth}}^2}$$ Therefore, $$M_{\text{planet}}=3.6\times3.6\times0.86\times M_{\text{Earth}}\approx 11.15M_{\text{Earth}}$$ The density, therefore, must be $$\text{Density}=\frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{V_{\text{planet}}}=\frac{11.15M_{\text{Earth}}}{46.7V_{\text{Earth}}}=0.2388\times\text{Density of Earth}$$ Earth's average density is 5.51 grams/cm3, the densest in the Solar System, so this planet must have a density of about 1.3158 grams/cm3, almost identical to the density of Jupiter! Its mass, though is closer to that of Uranus. Such a planet would be gaseous, consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium. It would not be terrestrial - in fact, it would be hard for life to exist there. Let's say that you let the mass change. Therefore, assuming that you have a planet with the density of Earth but a volume 46.7 times its size, you have a rather large planet a little under three times as massive as Neptune. Such a planet will certainly be gaseous - it is far too big to be a super-Earth, although it could be a massive solid planet - because of how massive it is. It will likely have scooped up a fair amount of gas and dust from the original protoplanetary disk. 

Situations like this are possible but would likely be short lived temporary solutions if everything else is earth-like. Now if you note that that the world is different in some way resource wise, that could be realistic long term. For example, maybe there are no fossil fuels left and motorized transport on a global scale is not supportable. 

Interesting question but I see one flaw. Your chosen people are not a monolithic whole. How you treat one of them will not work with another. Essentially you are making the common mistake of trying to treat humans as anything other than individuals, or a least effectively narrow groups. You end up with plenty of options for convincing people (in no particular order) 

Final Notes: On the nature of power. Power in a modern geopolitical sense is often broken down into a few parts. 

In short there would be major impacts on productivity half the year. Things would be slower and people less...awake so to speak. Though the six months fog free would probably be very vibrant and productive...so there you go. Oh...and solar and wind power are not things that are going to function on this landmass. 

$^1$ Homo heidelbergensis and homo rhodesiensis may very well be the same, so I suppose we can consider them as the same species, or possibly consider homo rhodesiensis as a continuation of homo heidelbergensis, if you want. $^2$ I'm discounting the possibility of a crossing by homo heidelbergensis because they would have had to get to northern Europe for this to even be possible, and I doubt they would have had the time. They started dying out (in that form, giving rise to the Neanderthals) about 300,000 years ago. 

As you can see, it travels in essentially a straight line, going at a little over 5 Au per year, at first. That’s not bad at all. It’s still going to take a long time to reach the base, but this is likely going to be on the order of thousands of years, not millions of years. 

Consider two substances with refractive indices $n_1$ and $n_2$. The reflectivity can be calculated as $$R=\left|\frac{n_1-n_2}{n_1+n_2}\right|^2$$ For air, $n\approx1$, and for water, $n\approx1.33$. Therefore, for a ray of light reflecting off of water, we have a reflectivity of $$R=\left|\frac{1-1.33}{1+1.33}\right|^2=0.02$$ The refractive index is often wavelength-dependent; for blood, it changes quite a lot over various wavelengths. If we consider the visible spectrum - about 400 nm to 700 nm - we see coefficients ranging from 1.44 to 1.40. This yields $R$ ranging from $0.028$ to $0.033$. Either way, we find that blood is more reflective than water. 

These are the two key factors to get what you are looking for. But as mentioned in other answers, the temperature swing in deserts from day to night is larger than in any other habitat, you simply don't have anything to stabilize it (water, trees, etc). Water also helps normalize temperatures a bit. 

Inventions: Ironically we don't really need any new tech to make this feasible. As mentioned it is still going to be more difficult/expensive but with modern technology we can certainly create a stable effective underground dwelling. 

There is one (ok there are more but this is key) more thing that needs to be taken into account and that is need. Hardship, and the need to advance are just as important as having the free time to advance. 

Purge: Just exterminate every single one of the zombies. No muss, no fuss, send in a clean-up crew with flame throwers. Exterminate/Experiment: Destroy most of them. Then, like nuclear technology I can see governments doing research into the weaponization of the zombie virus. This would of course end horribly for everyone. Additionally terrorist organizations may drop zombies into population centers and wreak havoc. The zombie farm: Use the virtually free labor for simple tasks. Its very green energy after all. Utilize zombies as free labor where basic motility is all that is required. This is also not a particularly good idea...but bad choices make for good stories.
