So just standing all day would give the desired number of calories. Imagine if I'd fidgeted while standing! Or even better, use any of these devices: 

I underestimated how short the interval between 7 and 8 was and forgot about the fact that there's no level 10. Still, it seems about right compared to the VO2max tests I had back in grad school. 

I reckon you have an exostosis (a benign bony growth projecting outward from a bone surface) on your heel bones, around your Achilles tendon's insertion. This rubs against the 'heel' of the shoe, which often contains cardboard-like material around the heel to support it. I haven't had this problem myself with any of my shoes in the last ~5 years without resorting to my more nefarious solution. In your case I suspect the heel bone rubs against the 'heel' of the shoe, because there's too much room (either due to your foot type or poor fit) or your laces aren't tied properly. When the shoe fits your foot like a glove, they can't move relative to each other and thus you won't get the damage on the shoe & blisters on your heel. Making the shoe fit better can be done with insoles/orthotics, but obviously you'd prefer to buy shoes that are a better fit in the first place. I'll ask around to get some advice on how to find a good fitting shoe (not based solely on 'it felt good'). If you can't find a shoe with a better fit, you could cut out part of the material. It involves opening up the stitching at the top of the 'heel', then poking in between and removing some of the support material. However, this also means the heel of the shoe will no longer be able to give the support it was designed for and you'll have to be able to stitch (or glue) the shoe back up. On the other hand, you have first hand experience with the damage your feet will do to the shoe if you don't, so it might be the lesser evil. Disclaimer: my father makes orthopedic shoes, so if I need it, I let him do it for me :-) 

I've been running for about 5 years now and almost every year I get problems on the medial side of my shins. If I keep running, eventually the soft tissue even swells up enough to be palpable and painful. I know I have very poor ankle stability, when I try ice skating it's so bad that the medial side of my shoes even touches the ice. I also have quite some pronation, all the way through my roll off, that get's worse when I start running faster. Together my weak ankles and some overweight, this is resulting in some recurring shin problems. 

While the other answers mention several possible causes, they fail to address why. So I'm going to add my 2 cents here as well, which I'll base mainly on the results of the phd-thesis from Tine Willems from the university of Ghent (Belgium), which focused on the intrinsic risk factors for exercise related lower leg pain and Murphy et al. in a study about risk factors for lower extremity injury. The first thing you must understand about injuries, is that there are many possible causes and they all interact with each other, so it can be difficult to prevent any form injury. You can get an injury from either a single overload, that exceeds a tissue's maximum tolerance (trauma) or from repeatedly overloading, which causes an overuse injury. As you're most likely to sustain an injury in your weakest link, you want to prevent overloading it. The factors that might cause this are divided in extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors. Amongst the extrinsic risk factors we count things like: 

Using some example values: 70kg * ~10m/s^2 * ~30m results in 21000 Joules. While that may seem a large number, converting it to kcal leaves you with a measly 5 kcal So I'd have to conclude that while all small bits help, you'd have to walk the stairs more frequently for it to be a truly useful exercise. 

Based on Barbie's excellent answer, I suspect we should view the exercise ball exactly for what it is: a ball to exercise on. It might help you train to get a better posture, which is useful for when you sit in a regular chair, but it isn't meant as an alternative for your permanent seating. 

That's not to say you can't work out with heavy balls! Simply trying to move your outstretched arms in full range of motion with heavy balls is destined to make your muscles very tired, very soon. Also the weight probably allows you to either do a ton of repetitions or perform them very fast. I would suggest looking for some kettle bell exercises and try doing some of those, only with the ball in your hand instead of a kettle bell. Once you've increased your fitness, you can always switch to the real deal. What's best about these exercises is that they also train your legs (squatting to touch the floor) and core (rotating your body against gravity). Furthermore, you use your arms in a full range of motion and in a much more natural way. So when you decide to take on something heavier, you'll be prepared! So please, don't go juggling heavy balls unless you want to become a professional juggler. 

If you've decided the first two options aren't for you, you're going to have to pick a shoe. That leaves three major options: do you need some correction or not? Without doing a gait analysis the only way to answer this is by looking at your history: do you have a history of running-related injuries, do you use orthotics in your regular shoes or do you need orthopedic footwear? If any of those is yes, get yourself checked up before buying a pair of shoes, because you're at an elevated risk of getting injured. Given that there are no cheap correcting shoes, you're pretty much out of luck. But what if you only just started running and don't have any prior injuries? Well, that doesn't mean you're not at risk. If you're planning to pick up running as a regular part of your workouts, than you have a stake in preventing that from happening. Because most overuse injuries take a long time to heal, they'll ruin any progress you've made so far, limit your options for alternative workouts and mean you'll have to pick up another workout until you're healed. So if not for your wallet, do it for your health. If buying the right shoes helps you not get injured than that trade-off alone should be a no-brainer. So say you get yourself checked, does this mean you have to buy expensive shoes? Well shoes, regardless of quality, wear down over time and much faster than most people like to admit. People who start running tend to pick their old tennis shoes or some worn-out pair of sneakers they have lying around. Big no-no, because wrong shoes and worn-out shoes are a major cause of injuries. They can alter your roll-off pattern the wrong way, because some parts of the shoe are more worn out than others and cause an asymmetrical load. Good shoes tend to be made of more durable material. This means they will be able to support your feet for a longer period of time, which may not safe you money, but hopefully will prevent you from getting injured. Again, you're making a trade-off between paying 100$ more or not being able to run for ~6 weeks. If you're favoring money over your own health, than you're not doing yourself a favor. Overall, running is a fairly inexpensive exercise, you don't need to pay for a gym or swimming pool. Apart from some functional clothing and shoes, you don't need much else. Investing in these things while not knowing whether you'll stick to it is always a gamble. However, they can also make the difference between having a pleasant experience and a dreadful one. For example, running in a cotton shirt will start to soak and stick to your body over time. Whereas with functional clothing, they will drain the sweat away and feel more pleasant (and warm!). As John mentioned, you don't have a guarantee that you'll get a quality analysis, so unless they are very reputable and friends recommended the place, I'd take his advice and first get some (preferably) free advice. If you do get a check up, make sure to ask questions, don't be afraid to ask 'dumb' questions, if he knows what he's doing, he should be able to tell you why. Remember, you don't have to buy shoes from that person, you can always take his advice and buy the shoes somewhere more affordable. Be sure to try on different pairs of shoes, not just those with a fancy color or those that are on sale, there are major differences between the lasts and builds between different shoe brands. If the shoe doesn't feel right, don't let them talk you into buying it. If you do decide to not get a check up, be sure to buy a decent shoe. Some pointers on how to recognize one:
