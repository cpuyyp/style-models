Your people would have adaptations similar to the Sherpa who live at high altitude in Nepal. There are numerous studies of their adaptations, here is a review of the studies and their findings. Some highlights are increased blood flow, more oxygen-carrying capacity in the blood, stronger hearts, and larger chests. A more complete summary is below: 

In Seveneves Neal Stephenson describes weapons that fling tiny robots as bullets. Specifically designed not to penetrate the hull for a spacecraft, but carried a whole host of nasty tools to hurt targets. They could differentiate between targets and even change direction in the air. 

Spoiler: They don't last long. Now here is where the history of this planet diverges from our own. This impact forms two moons. One of which becomes just like our moon, because it's very important. The other does its own thing for a while and is much smaller and identical in composition. If you want a planet like Earth (oxygen, life, really okay place to live), it needs to have a history similar to the earth. It took the earth ~4.1 billion years before it got to conditions close to today, and ~4.6 billion years to get to humans. Note My source doesn't start the time at the formation, but ~700 million years later. Which means that this planet needs to get to get its rings sometime after 4 billion years has passed because the rings themselves may last only a few hundred million years. This is where that second moon comes in, say ~4.4-ish billion years after the planet formed. Thanks to gravitational interactions it has finally spiraled in too close to the earth and reaches its Roche Limit and breaks up. For a body like a moon that's a distance of about 10,000 km above the surface of the earth, half as high as GPS satellites. This is really bad. Shortly after the initial breakup, parts of the moon will rain down on the earth. One mountain sized rock probably wiped out the dinosaurs, there may be thousands of them raining down. In all likely hood, this will sterilize the planet and you will get a world not too different from Venus with rings. Because that answer is boring, let's examine the case where the Hard Rain is relatively mild and life finds a way to thrive afterward. The planet This planet will be quite different from the earth. The area under the rings will be an exclusion zone because the material will continue to fall to the earth for millions of years. Expect lots of craters and volcanism due to damage to the tectonic plates. Impact damage may be less severe due to rocks falling in at only orbital speeds ~8 km/s rather than the usual 20-30 km/s. The shoreline will also be a no-go zone because of tsunamis caused by impacts to the oceans, tides will be unaffected by the rings because they are distributed across the planet. The sky may be constantly hazy due to a much higher frequency of impacts. Heat from the reentry and dust may contribute to extreme weather by providing extra energy and condensation points for water droplets.The atmosphere may cause cancer, the dust causing Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. Overall expect the planet to be cooler due to the dust, the light blocked by the rings will have less of an effect in comparison. Magma movement will not be affected. There will also be more UV radiation from the reentries of the rings. Possibly Less of a night because of light bouncing off the rings and the dust halo around the earth. And probably a whole lot more which will be added as I think of it. 

The Hero is a figurehead, a symbol, there solely to inspire people. It's no longer about tradition and warfare, it's political. It's less about the Hero BEING heroic as much as it is about the Hero now APPEARING heroic. 

What you are describing sounds more like territorial clashes/border raiding than war. War has a purpose - annihilation, conquest, resources, whatever it may be, it's a concentrated military endeavour undertaken for a specific purpose. It's an all or nothing thing, and usually a successful war is a short war, with clearly defined objectives, as they are rather taxing on resources (manpower, materiel etc) - and any successful campaign relies on maintain or increasing your resources while denying them to your opponent. Instead of war between the two nations, have you considered the idea of disputed territories - a kind of borderland area between the two nations. Or perhaps have factions within each nation constantly at war - think medieval England and Scotland - most often the skirmishes would be between clans/houses raiding each other. Trade continues between the two nations themselves, but there's constant fighting between some factions. Otherwise, your only other realistic course is, as others have mentioned, some kind of black market/smuggling operations. Or, alternatively, an enterprising third nation acts as a middle-man/distribution centre and makes a tidy profit in the meantime. 

Isomer Bomb Triggered With the right Isomer, it may be possible to induce a very violent and rapid decay by blasting it with gamma rays. This may be a viable method for trigger an explosion using Hafnium which has been looked into. Your weapons could consist of a primer that triggers a blast of gamma rays into (insert isomer here) resulting in the rapid decay. Put in a casing that can help focus the decay products to continue the reaction. This may or may not be how some nuclear weapons work. With advances in particle physics, it may be possible to engineer elements/isomers that fit the needs required. On a similar note, a universe I'm working on has an extremely advanced civilization using a stable-ish Hassium isomer in kinetic weapons because of its very high density, predicted to be ~40 g/cm$^3$. Stored? Since an isomer is a metastable nucleus, that is to say, kept from decaying because its constitute parts have just enough extra energy to hold together and that decay occurs when that energy is released. Therefore, it might be possible to store the isomer in an environment that constantly keep the nucleus on the perturbed. I imagine a scenario where the isomer is stored under gamma ray illumination, the energy of the decaying isomer is replaced the flux of extra gamma radiation. This would only be practical if the decay chain has several steps in it, otherwise, the gamma radiation would be better suited as the weapon itself. 

Given the technological constraints of 1910's-1950's, and that war would have evolved from a set of decisive battles on a single field (ala Azincourt) to a series of fronts (ala WW I +), the easiest way is simple: Spin. Run a massive PR campaign. The hero is selected and sent to an unspecified 'front line' location (unspecified for Operational Security reasons, of course). Given the spread out nature of the war, the Hero is always "over there", and the population would be relying on news reports, press releases and propaganda to give them their information - so give it to them: 

By building of the societal implications and urges present in normal society, and bringing them in-line with the existing structures. It would simply be approached in a similar manner as recruitment for the armed forces/police etc. The want civil minded/patriotic/reliable people to help defend their nation/way of life/love of pineapples. Just because the subjects have super-powers, they are still raised as part of normal society. They might have a sense of civic duty, a desire to be a part of something greater than themselves for the greater good. They may even buy into the "with great power comes great responsibility", or they might just do it for the solid pay, accommodation and meals that army life provides. The presence of their super-powers just means they'll be fast-tracked for a specialist position (in much the same way that defence forces have SSO's for example). Opinion: I don't see how this would be any different than for 'normal' people. The fact that they have undefined super-powers is largely irrelevant.

There is something that already exists, that if you do not have it, having a lot of intelligence and technology can be tremendous disadvantage. It is wisdom. Possessing a lot of intelligence and/or technology without the wisdom to appropriately apply these things is quite destructive. With intelligence and technology comes new discoveries, new discoveries can be dangerous, especially if misused. Many times, with new discoveries, we only partially understand the situation, and there are hidden dangers that we not realize the danger that they pose until further investigation has been done. We generally posses fair amounts of both in our current culture/society, and thus are quite attuned to discovering and eliminating the ill effects. If you need more motivation, take a look at the early history of X-Rays, $URL$ 

This trial is not too different from real trials. It ultimately will become a battle of evidence. Prosecution has evidence suggesting that the perpetrator committed the crime, the defense has evidence suggesting that he couldn't, because he could not physically be present. The strategy at trial from each side will be about convincing the jury that the evidence and story presented by the other side does not represent what actually happened. This is what actually happens in trials in real life. Each side may have what it considers to be definitive proof, but in reality, it comes down to how much weight the jury members attach to each testimony, witness, and exhibit. There was wisdom in the construction of our judicial system that required the convincing of a jury of peers. Outside of the mathematical realm, there exists no objective standard of proof. As such, our system challenges the prosecutor of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt for criminal cases, to the jury the details of his case. Each person of the jury has their own internal standards of proof, and it is the goal of the prosecutor to select a favorable jury and then convince them of his case. Alternatively, it is the goal of the defense to also select a favorable jury, and then to obfuscate or disprove the case. I would challenge you to find a type of evidence that is above reproach. Pictures and videos can be faked, witnesses are unreliable and can fall apart under cross examination, and physical evidence can be contaminated, the chain of custody called into question, or the conclusions of the experts challenged. The fact that the potential defendant can manufacture, at the time of the crime, seemingly exonerating evidence gives him a tremendous advantage, but it makes him nowhere near invincible. Jurors can choose to ignore evidence, there may be enough evidence on the prosecutors side that they are convinced "beyond a reasonable doubt" to ignore the exculpatory evidence. Additionally, the jurors may not make decisions that are entirely cerebral. They make make decisions based upon emotions and intuition. It is my estimation that this guy will ultimately get caught. He may be able to buy a few passes with his exculpatory evidence, but if he continues in his life of crime, he will ultimately get stuck. That type of life changes a persons psyche, and most other humans will pick up on those danger queues and intuit the correct decision in opposition to what may be exonerating evidence. 

But, as Shalveny states in their answer, generally names/titles are derived from the power source and the method in learning/developing. At the end of the day, it is your world and you get final say, but generally speaking it's commonly broken down along four main lines in popular fiction: Divine magic: i.e. magic either imbued as a direct result of appeal to a divine being (prayers, wardings etc) and used by religious bodies and agents (clerics, priests, magisters, acolytes etc) Arcane magic: magic that is not associated with any particular god or diety. Most commonly used by magicians/wizards/sorcerers etc and often depends on the strength of the wielder. Elemental/Natural Magic: Magic that is natural in source, often describe as maintaining the balance of life and guarding the natural world. Often straddling the border between Divine and Arcane. Users are most often depicted as Druids/shaman Ritual magic: Power is drawn through the completion of rituals - sigil, ceremonies, relics. Takes time to complete, and can often involve a sacrifice of some description. Shamans, cultists etc are often portrayed performing ritual magic, generally speaking doesn't necessarily require innate magical abilities and is very often used by the antagonists/big bads. 

You aren't as safe as you think Other properties of the ship The combustion chamber need not be made of any sort of imagined material. Conditions in today's rocket nozzles readily exceed the material properties of the nozzle, so measures are taken to protect them. Cooling is the biggest, some use the cryogenic fuels through the nozzles as a preheat, others use a stream of fuel to form a layer between the combustion and the nozzle. The same could be done with the nuclear fire of a torch ship. The plasma in a test fusion reactor is contained in powerful magnetic fields and kept away from the walls of the container. The same could be done with the torch ship, stand off the reaction from the walls of the chamber, add some radiation shielding and a cooling system and you are all set. Beam Weapons (To include directed energy) A beam of charged particles could easily wreak havoc on the nuclear reaction, admittedly it would be challenging to ram through the exhaust stream, but focused enough and it could get through. Adding alpha partilces to a fusion reaction could snuff it out or cause a runaway reaction. Beta Particles could cause issues as well by changing the charge of the plasma. The effectiveness of this depends on the magnitude of the magnetic containment and its polarization. A beam of neutrons could also cause issues, interfering with the reaction and adding a ton of extra energy to the chamber as they decay. Heavier Ions will also interfere with the reaction and do physical damage to the containment chamber. Pick your wavlength of the laser, and dump plenty of power into it. Depending on the content of the reaction some wavelengths may pass right through it and damage the walls of containment. I'm thinking gamma radion of a magnitude that exceeds the design of the torch ship. Likewise, some wavelengths may be absorbed by the reaction and exceed the design of the ship, I'd guess microwaves. Results may vary, ask your lead engineer if you have questions Kenetic Weapons Relevant XKCD Comic. Moving fast enough and your kinetic projectile will be unaffected by the nuclear fire. If the contact with the heat is brief then the projectile won't have time to vaporize/ablate away. I'll see if I can apply some thermodynamics to it later on. Also, even if you manage to vaporize it, now you've got a cloud of vapor with the energy of the projectile moving towards you. Explosives Getting them into the chamber is the main issue. Get through the exhaust stream and your payload will do its job. 

Security would be handled much the same as in any other type of undulating terrain. Also, bear in mind that a desert isn't just rolling sand dunes, a lot of desert is flat, dry terrain. Dry watercourses, sparse scrub. Dunes are often uninhabited, and, one would imagine, if doing a royal tour the Queen and entourage wouldn't be seeing the whole lot, but more moving from oasis to settlement along the peripheries, hence solving a lot of the water problem. Anyway, back to the security detail. While the group is moving, there would, I imagine, be the standard scouts and outriders. I would have the 36 guardsmen split into squads of 12. The first 12 ride in front of the Queen, the second 12 behind. The last 12 are your scouts and flankers. 3 front, 3 rear and 3 down each side spread out so that they are far enough from the party to intercept, but close enough to be in regular contact. The Queen and Crown Prince ride with the advisors/protectors in the middle. If possible, one or two of them would be scrying ahead/around for any danger as they move along (not sure how magic works in your world), and others would be ready to defend the Queen while others focus on eliminating any attackers. Once camp is struck, similar protocol. The units of Soldiers take shifts with picket/sentry duty, as do the advisors. Tight security measures would insist on random patrol routes and the camp being cold - campfires can be seen a long way away in open terrain, and they kill your night vision like you would not believe. Hiding in sand is also problematic for any would be assassins/ambushers. Sand dunes are notoriously unstable, and more than likely to bury any would be assailant. It's the reason why you don't dig into sand dunes at the beach - they collapse. If they do manage to successfully hide themselves, then they would need extricate themselves quickly enough to maintain surprise. And they'd have to hide themselves along the main travel routes, possibly for days, places where, most likely, the vigilance of the guard would pay off. Horses could also prove problematic for any hidden assailants, as they spook easily and would balk at stepping anywhere where someone is hiding. Turning it around, if I was going to attack the Queen and her retinue, I'd do it like this: Attack the camp in the middle of the night, halfway between mid-night and dawn, with a primarily mounted group. There are two main objectives: 1) Scatter the horses 2) Burn and destroy as much of the camp as possible Infiltrators on foot cut the picket lines for the horses, a large group of mounted warriors ride through the sentries and camp, scattering the defenders, killing what they can and setting fire to the tents and stores before moving through and scattering the horses. In the confusion, kidnap the primary target, then leave quickly. Strike fast and withdraw. This leaves the defenders scattered and demoralised, with no reliable transport and low on supplies. As far as tracking them in the desert, if it's a large group, then they have to stay close to water. Having someone knowledgeable about the terrain, landmarks and available water would help immensely. Work our where the nearest water is that can accommodate such a group and head there. The more stable the terrain, the more likely there are to be tracks. 

High amounts of UV will do it. Single celled organisms would be sterilized, whilst those with a dead skin layer would be relatively fine, though likely subject to higher amounts of mutations and thus skin cancer. You can adjust the dose to keep the whole planet sterile, but perfectly livable for any organism that has developed sunglasses and clothes, and they can grow plants within a greenhouse (if you have dosed your planet with very large amounts of UV continuously). If you need a mechanism to explain the UV, go with high amounts of X-rays hitting an earth type atmosphere, resulting in down-conversion by the atmosphere to UV radiation. If necessary, you can construct the history of your planet so that it develops complex life, that is then killed off by successive gamma ray bursts nearby. $URL$ You will need more than one, of course, because a single gamma ray burst will only effect one side of the planet. Additionally, how sterile do you need it? Your story may be able to function with most complex life killed off, and the only life on the planet are single celled organisms around a deep thermal vent. 

I can't recall reading your other answers, so please forgive if this has been covered elsewhere, but there are a couple of possibilities, the first that spring to my mind are how each is 'cast'. 1) Direct Divine intervention requires some form of request/prayer (i.e. "[insert name of god], in thy name [please do xxxx]") 2) There is a direct visual effect (i.e. a golden halo/glow appearing around the caster, the gods/spirits symbol appearing briefly) 3) Divine intervention/spells are only available to the truly faithful or devout, and may need some form of holy symbol to use as a focus (i.e. crucifix etc) 4) Magic requires the use of spell components and incantations. Material items that are used as to cast the spell but are consumed in the process (I think this used to be a requirement in D&D - too many years since I played it), whereas Divine magic doesn't. 5) Possibly, the divine intervention can only occur if the 'caster' is possessed by the God/Spirit that could leave a visually noticeable imprint on the caster, literally becoming a vessel of the divine will - eyes glowing, tattoos appearing that kind of thing.
