11-speed chain is narrower than 10-speed. You keep the crank but you must put on 11-speed rings which will most certainly fit judging by the pictures on SRAM's website. The shape of the cranks remains the same and the BCD is identical, of course. 

Switch the chain to a cog in the middle of the cassette. Suspend the bike, put it on a work-stand or get a helper lift the rear wheel and turn the crank. Listen for noise from the chain on the cog. If there is any, turn the barrel adjuster (the thing in lower right corner of the pic, where the cable housing meets the derailleur) left or right by one click at the time until the noise stops. Check with the chain on the other cogs as well, re-adjust if necessary. Do a final check by switching gears up and down. If upshift isn't smooth turn the adjuster one click anti-clockwise. If down shifting is hesitant, turn the adjuster one click clockwise. PS The cable housing of the derailleur cable looks quite long which might also hinder smooth shifting. 

In the menu that shows the paired sensors delete the sensor you want to remove. 510 will ask for a confirmation. Then re-pair the sensor. It may help to remove the battery from the sensor and putting it back after a minute. 

There's this horizontal pin on the brake lever next to the hoods. It's meant to open the brakes for easier wheel changes as Campy brakes don't have release levers on the calipers. It seems be in the 'released' position. Pull the lever and push the pin from the side that's sticking out. See if it resolves your problem. If yours brake pads are already very close to the rims you will probably have to adjust the cable. 

A double layered triangle of bubble wrap under the pants in front of the exposed bits. Cheap and effective! In days of severe cold I use the same method between base and medium layers on the upper chest, though only single layered. Works perfectly. 

Assuming that you have a rim-braked road-bike, any rear hub that is Shimano 10/11 speed compatible will take your cassette and all other 10-speed Shimano road cassettes. Just be aware that you need a 1.85mm spacer that goes on a freehub 11-speed body before you put on the cassette. Without the spacer the 10s cassette will move sideways. 

The frame damage is more cosmetic I could tell from the pictures. The quick release can be replaced at low cost. The bigger problem could be to take it out because the end of the thread looks bend and damaged. Best go to your LBS (local bike shop). 

You'll need a new bottom bracket with a different axle length, a new crankset of course, front derailleur and matching shifter. Since you'll probably need to buy a complete set of brifters it will be quite an expense. And while you're at it you'll probably have to get new cable housings and cables for the brakes. Not to mention new bar tape. At least you can keep the rear derailleur and the cassette if the resulting new gears suit you, but you may need a new chain. And if your triple has less than 10 gears on the cassette you'll probably have to find an older double crankset and matching shifters. INMHO I would keep the bike as it is because the expense will be quite hefty. 

Basically you may drop steps 2, 3 and 6. You'll just remove the shifter cables from the STI levers. It might not please the aesthetes but it will work. If the STI levers have the shifter cables run through external housings you remove these as well. If the housings run under the tape, you leave them alone, you just cut them where they come out from under the tape. (At this point it is a good idea to buy a cable and housing cutter which is a very useful tool that avoids a lot of messy and badly cut brake/shifter cables and housings.) The downside for keeping the STI levers is that the combined levers are heavier and have the unnecessary side-ways freedom of movement. But that's fine if it doesn't bother you. If you find out that this is unnerving then you may switch to regular brake levers. The day you want to change the tape, you may acquire a pair of regular brake levers and put them on the bar. Edit: No, you can't keep the shifting cables running from the bar just through the friction shifters. You'll need to remove them and rethread them directly through the friction shifters. 

SIGMA make a connecting pod with USB connection to the PC. It takes the bike computer via twist lock. They have their own data suite for reading and archiving data from the bike computer. You should find it on their website. 

You can lower the bar first by flipping the stem. Judging from the angle of your stem it will lower the bar by at least 5-7cm (2-3 inches). Which is already a good start The next step would be to migrate the 2 spacers from below the stem to the top. With two spacers on top it might look a bit awkward but there is no technical argument against doing it. So far you've changed nothing on the bike and you can revert to the previous setting at any time. Safety advice: Working on bar and stem can lead to serious injury if not done properly, so make sure to tighten any screw at the correct torque and to re-adjust the headset correctly. There are plenty of videos on YouTube, the Park Tool site and advice on Sheldon Brown's page how this is done. 

For a complete knowledge base on fitting tires for different rim-sizes, see here: $URL$ and scroll down to 'Width Considerations'. 30 or 33mm tires will fit your rims but they'll probably need a lot of pressure which might just be counter-productive on snow. On the other hand you should consider another possible issue: 30 or 33mm tires might not fit into the front fork or between the rear stays. If they do, you might want to buy a second pair of wider wheels and use the wider tires on these. It will keep your 'Summer' wheels nice and shiny. 

0.8mm is very thin and dangerous. The mechanic is right to tell you to replace the rim! Keep it only if you want to play with your life because it may fail in a catastrophic manner! More dangerous even on a front wheel. Many rims have wear indicators, usually a couple of holes along the braking surfaces, that tell you that the rim is over the limit once one of the holes becomes invisible. 

A carbon seatpost will not freeze in a carbon tube much unlike metal to metal contact. So there is no need for the procedure you envisioned. Using the carbon paste is highly recommended in your situation and also with metal/carbon contact. However you should never ever use any kind of grease or fat which might damage carbon components. Consider investing in a torque wrench because it is near impossible to 'measure' the correct value with the wrist-o-meter. The recommended applicable torque is often printed on the clamp, like 3-5Nm. You should apply the lowest value first and increase the torque only of the post slips. 

You'll just have to make sure that the rotors match the type of brake pads you use. Shimano mark their rotors for 'resin pads only' and the like! – 

Your front derailleur is 'undershifting', meaning that when you release the pressure on the lever, the FD moves a tiny bit inwards. This throws the chain off the big ring towards the small ring. If the chain is on a smaller rear sprocket you might notice that it is rubbing slightly against the outer plate of the FD. You need to adjust the HI-screw on the FD. Give it a turn anti-clockwise and check if the chain stays on the ring. As @Criggie justly points out, when a bike's settings are adjusted on a workstand things change a bit when it is ridden. Mainly due to the slight deformation of the frame when under the load of the rider. 

The empty ink-tube of a ballpoint pen makes good cable ends. The metal ones may be squeezed into place. If you have a plastic one cut off 1 cm, put over the cable end and heat with a flame. 

A CX-50 is usually fitted with 46-36 and is 10 speed. Occasionally I replace the 36 with a 34 on mine. Any flat 110mm BCD ring of 50/52 will fit instead of the 46 ring and the 36 is the usual combination with a 52. The chain will have to be 2-3 links longer and the FD must move up by one or two mm to clear the big ring. (Note: You may even change the rings without having to remove the crank from the bottom bracket, as they can easily be manoeuvred around the arms and the pedal.) 

That calls for a shim. Cut a narrow strip from a drinks can, about 3-5cm long and lay it under the cable stop before re-tightening the screw. Make sure all the surfaces are clean and degreased. The soft aluminium of the shim will 'absorb' the remaining roughness of the tubes and the cable-stop and make slipping more difficult. (I've solved the problem of the brake lever rotating around a steel handlebar in this fashion.) 

Doing it like the first picture shows is definitely not a good idea. The strap should be the other way round with the buckle as close as possible to the pedal's body. Reason 1: it can be tightened by pulling the end up and released with a the flick of the thumb on the buckle. (The reason for this black plastic end of the buckle) Reason 2: The end of the right strap falls over the foot and may be caught between chain and chain-wheel. The end will hardly drag on the ground. In the days where I used straps I used waxed string to tie the part going through the pedal to the thin post which is more reliable than a 360° twist. Today I would use a small zip-tie. The strap in the second picture isn't properly routed over the roller of the buckle. It may just be a promotional picture with the end of the strap photo-shopped away. And last but not least: if the strap is really too long cutting off the excess is still an option. 

The stutter comes from the way the brakes are actuated. From the picture on Javelin's site I see that the housing is held at the top of the head-tube. When you brake the fork flexes backwards causing the cable's tension to change. The brakes will be slightly released causing to fork to move again, re-tightening the brakes, pushing the fork backwards. This happens in quick succession thus the brake stutter. The way to cure it is to move the attachment of the cable-housing to the crown of the fork. There are front cable hangers that can be screwed to the hole where a side-pull brake would be attached. Google for 'Front Cable Hanger Fork Mount' 

If the instructions that come with the pedals tell you to use the washers with carbon cranks then you should do it. The reason for the washers is that that they keep the axle from rubbing against the crank and thus damaging the carbon when tightening the pedals.Oh yes, and you can compensate the thickness of the washers by moving each cleat 0.5mm outside. 

The roller of the dynamo should run on that ribbed track under the treads. And the axis of rotation of the rotor needs to point very precisely at the axle of the wheel. (I've always checked that with a piece of string!) BTW: The roller doesn't look worn to me. It looks as if it had been machined that way, compare with a new one. And you may also find a rubber cap that fits over the steel roller although this will increase the diameter and make the dynamo turn at a lower RPM and dim the light in an unwanted way. 

Since the Presta valve closes after each pump-stroke the pressure in the hose is equal to the pressure in the inner tube. The chuck does not mechanically open the valve as with Schrader (car-type) valves. You will have to overcome this pressure with the following pump-stroke to get more air into the tube. The maximum pressure obtained in the inner tube equals the maximum pressure the pump is able to build up. Track pumps have a valve between the cylinder and the manometer. The manometer will indicate and hold hold the value of the actual pressure. When you remove the chuck from the valve the pressure is released with an explosive sound. That's normal. But you have to take care not to touch the sensitive top of the valve while removing the chuck because that will let some air escape. It's a matter of quick and precise movement. Presta valves don't have rubber gaskets as opposed to Schrader. The airtight seal is achieved by a conical stem pressed into a conical hole. The little knob pulls the surfaces tighter. If the valve is in a good condition it will also hold the pressure without a tightened knob. If the valve leaks after disconnection from the pump the tube (or the core of the valve if it is of that type) needs replacing.
