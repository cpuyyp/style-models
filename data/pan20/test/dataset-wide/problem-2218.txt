In press coverage, the receiver will exploit the mismatch by going deep. In soft coverage, the QB will throw a quicker ball to the receiver and hope the speed mismatch leads to a larger gain. 

In this case it is the runner that must reach the base before the ball, giving the tie to the defensive team. So the tie goes to the runner, you know, sometimes or something. 

Apologies for the lack of links as I am basing this off my (limited) playing experience, but it seems to be the case when I watch NFL and College games as well. 

So in this case the rules claim the ball must arrive first. Giving the tie to the runner. However... 

Many times these long term contracts come with large amounts of cash up front, as is the case with the Texas rangers new 20 year $3billion deal with Fox Sports. 

I have been in what appears to be this exact same situation (captaining a social indoor cricket team). There is no single right answer, but here are some ideas that appeared to work. 

In all levels of cricket, it's a courtesy to the scorers and the media (if any) to specify a batting order and a wicket-keeper before the match, but it is not binding during the match. (The designation of the captain, however, is binding.) The particular example is from the World Cup, where teams operate with a predefined squad of 15. So the preprinted sheets ensure that the playing XI and the substitutes are chosen from the set of permitted players. The batting order is an added convenience. 

For some card, board, and computer games, you can also have more than two teams playing against each other, but here you're getting quite far away from sports. I would also add 

There is an interesting unwritten rule that actually gets contradicted in the official MLB rules. The "tie goes to the runner" claim is one that most baseball fans have heard. 

Quarterbacks take a lot of hits in the wishbone. The offense requires the QB to run with the ball on outside options and take hits from linebackers/lineman even when they pitch the ball. For this reason, QB's get hurt often in the wishbone. Related to #1, with most pro-offenses being pass heavy spread or west coast style, QB's are reluctant to be featured in the wishbone as it hurts their chances of advancing to the NFL. Related to #2, because QB's are reluctant to be wishbone QB's, college teams are reluctant to feature the offense as it could damage recruiting. This effect runs down to the high school levels as well. The wishbone excelled in a time where linebackers were considerably slower than today. Without hard 40 time stats, it is generally accepted that defensive linebackers move much better today than in previous eras. The wishbone requires the QB and RB to get to the corner in many of their bread and butter plays in order to force a DE to choose the QB or RB, and then have the QB or RB beat the corner back for large plays. Faster linebackers require more blocking on the outside, and spoil the top plays of the wishbone. There are few stars in a wishbone offense. The QB may be the biggest benefactor stats wise (and we covered why they don't want to be featured in the offense) and the remaining skill players spread touches more than in modern day offenses. Time. If you fall behind in a game, the wishbone takes a long time to score points. Most plays are running plays, and a team with a weak defense will find themselves with no plays in the arsenal (and perhaps not the right talent to execute even if they did) to catch up against large deficits. 

The number of runs you can score of a single delivery is in principle unlimited, because the batsmen can keep running forever. This was especially possible before the introduction of current Lost Ball rule, for example when the ball got stuck in a tree. 

If your aim, as a social team, is not primarily to win at all costs, then your aim should be to encourage behavior that is conducive to the long-term development of your team, your club, and your sport. So encourage coming to training, encourage committing to being available, encourage learning how to score, encourage being a 7th man. 

There are no yellow or red cards in cricket. There is a system of warnings for technical infractions and unfair play, but these are not signaled in a particular way, only communicated verbally. There is also no official way to eject a player from a game altogether. I'm not familiar with the cases you mention, but there have been occasions in international cricket where yellow and red cards have been used humorously. But they have no official merit. 

A normal BABIP for a pitcher is around.300. It's possible due to exceptionally poor, or exceptionally good defense that "normal" could be anywhere from .290 - .310. So anywhere within that spread should be considered somewhat normal. What a high BABIP tells us is that a pitcher is unlucky. It tells us this because we are generalizing that once a ball is put into play (notice strikeouts, homeruns, sac flies and walks do not count) the pitcher has no effect on whether that ball is a hit or an out. If the average ball in play goes for a hit at a .300 rate, but pitcher A has a BABIP of .370, it's telling us that this pitcher should regress towards the mean. So if the pitcher does regress towards the mean, we would expect other stats like ERA or WHIP to come down as well. On the flip side, a low BABIP tells us that a pitcher has been lucky that more balls hit in play did not go for hits. So we can look at a pitcher with a .250 BABIP and expect that his other stats may be going up as well as he regresses towards the mean. Now it's certainly not full proof and doesn't take into account fly ball/ground ball rates etc... But used with other advanced statistics, it can tell you quite a bit. BABIP can also be used for hitters, however it is not quite as helpful. While it can be generally said that once a ball is in play, a pitcher has little influence over whether or not that ball is a hit, it can't be said for hitters. This is mostly due to speed, where faster hitters are more likely to effect their BABIP due to running out infield singles. 

I started training for triathlons 3 years ago and have completed one Olympic distance race each year (in addition to 2-3 half-Marathons per year). I train year-round because it helps me stay in shape. I don't train for races and I mainly compete against myself, but doing a race helps me push my limits. I spend most of my training time with running because it gives me the best workout and I can do it in the winter, but I do enjoy riding and open-water swimming as soon as I can get out. I am in the pond from late April through late October. I am having knee trouble right now and stopped running. As a result, I swim more than in previous years and I pay more attention to how I am doing in the water. When I began with triathlon training at the age of 48, I initially struggled with finding a freestyle rhythm. I kept switching back to breast stroke. My breathing technique improved quickly, though, and I can now do 2400 meter freestyle swims in open water comfortably without stopping because I have to catch my breath or I swallowed water. I usually start with a 3-2-3-2 breathing pattern but can sustain a 3-3 pattern as well if I pace myself a little. I can switch between patterns as needed. I pay attention to my form, try to be streamlined, stretch my arm forward, pull back strongly all the way, minimize body roll, look down and keep my neck relaxed. I really feel comfortable in the water at all times. I have books about swimming techniques for triathletes and I seem to be doing everything they say. But - no matter what I try, I can't swim faster than about 2:30/100m, which appears fast to me but is abysmally slow in comparison and puts me into the bottom 5% in the swim in every race. My biking and running is more middle-of-the-road, so this is not a general physical limitation of my body. Clearly, I must be doing something wrong in the water. Based on other forum posts, it appears that most people who start out swimming struggle with breathing or fear or other "minor" barriers. Once they overcome this, they can swim a competitive pace. In my case, I don't experience the typical beginner's problems. I am just slow, and I can't find much direct advice that would help me figure out why. I realize that I could take lessons, do laps in a controlled environment (pool), etc. I am concerned that I will end up spending time and money on a trainer and pool lessons that may not help me because I am swimming already at the ceiling of my abilities. I am not ready for this. On the other hand, I am so much slower than where I think I should be (at least 20% to 30%) that there must be an obvious cause. I am not just looking to fine-tune my form. What should I do? 

It really depends on the current play called. Ideally there won't need to be a change in the route. This is because many offensive schemes/formations predict that the mismatch will occur and there is a set plan for exploiting the mismatch. However, sometimes the defense will simply screw up coverage, or sending a receiver in motion will create the mismatch by changing coverage. In these instances where the mismatch is unanticipated there are two primary options (which happen to be the two you and your friend were arguing about): 

$URL$ That article also goes on to state the viewership of a team like the Yankees on the YES network (318,000 average) vs a smaller market team like the Royals (32,000). Taken in that context, the Pittsburgh deal may not be all that bad. It may not be the best thing for parity in the league, but considering many teams are getting large front loaded contracts, equity stakes in TV networks that can be worth more than their franchises, and predictable cash flow, these deals can be a huge win for organizations. 

The ball usually comes into play when the bowler starts his run-up. I have also seen that umpires have sanctioned batsmen for changing their stance during the bowler's run-up (e.g., Kevin Pietersen in Sri Lanka 2012), but I don't have a source for a rule about that. 

I think you need to distinguish two separate attributes here: First, there are team sports, meaning multiple individuals work together, vs. individual sports. And second, there are sports where the participants react to each others' actions vs. sports where the participants' performances are each measured on some objective scale and the best performer wins. As you pointed out, there are many team sports, in my sense, involving more than one team: track relays, swim relays, ski relays, team golf, team gymnastics, etc. You can basically take any individual sport and make a team sport like this out of it. But those are all sports where each performance is measured separately. But what your question was really aiming at, I think, is that there are apparently very few "mutually reactive" sports involving more than two parties. This applies to both team sports and individual sports. For example, individual sports such as tennis are normally played between two parties as well. There are some activities where you have multiple individuals all playing against each other, especially if you are willing to stretch the definition of "sport" a bit:
