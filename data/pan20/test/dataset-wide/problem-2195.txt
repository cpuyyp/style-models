While team captains have been elected by their clubs throughout the history of football, the team captain was only an official part of the NFL starting in 2007. Their role on the field is not anything more than representing the team during the coin toss. If they are on the field during a penalty, they are typically the one who communicates with the referee about accepting or declining the penalty, but this is not always so. In the NFL, each team elects a captain (either by vote of the players or appointed by the coaching staff) from the offense, defense and special teams based on leadership on and off the field. In the NCAA, most schools have three team captains but this varies from school to school and the responsibilities of the captain are the same as in the NFL. During special event games such as the Super Bowl or a BCS Bowl, schools will often bring in former players or VIP's from the school to serve as honorary team captains. 

So, it appears that the spirit of the rule is not to prevent movement before the snap of the ball, but to prevent the offensive players from simulating the snap. This, to me, largely seems like a judgement call on behalf of the officials but it is pretty obvious that when the whole offensive line turns around to look at the sideline that they are not attempting to simulate a snap. I'm assuming that the spirit of the rule is the same in the NFL as referenced by corsiKa's answer.

Michael Jordan (twice) of the Chicago Bulls - 1995-1996 and 1997-1998 Willis Reed of the New York Knicks - 1969-1970 Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers - 1999-2000 

Jan Hubbard tells a very interesting story about the series that helped change the format to 2-3-2, It all began on 1984 NBA Finals between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers. 

I also seen cases when there isn't any offence players around the throwing player because it's the first throw or because they count on him to score or don't want to be causght surprise in fast break. 

In all of those deals the buying club should get to an agreement with the selling club about player price. Then the buying club should get to an agreement with the player (or his agent) about player contract. If this is an exchange deal (section 5) the selling club should also get to an agreement with the exchanging player (or his agent) about player contract. I can think about some reasons for a player move/transfer: 

The reason Al-Deehani compete under the Olympic flag is that the Kuwait Olympic Committee has been suspended by the International Olympic Committee due to governmental interference. The reason the Yugoslavian medalists compete under the Olympic flag is: 

When determining turnovers for a given player, how exactly are they determined? Wikipedia defines turnovers as 

However, I'm not clear on what happens on errant passes. When a player in possession of the ball makes a pass that is immediately intercepted by a defender, then obviously the player who passed the ball is charged with a turnover. My question is what happens if the ball is tipped by the player that the ball was intended for before the defender gains possession of the ball? Who is charged with a turnover in that situation, the player who made the pass or the player who tipped the ball before the defender gained possession? Is it determined by who touched the ball last or the player who last had full possession of the ball? 

Recently during the USA Track and Field Olympic trials, there was a tie for third place between Allyson Felix and Jenebah Tarmoh. It appears that there was previously no tiebreaker rule in place for the Olympic trials, so they were given the option of either competing in a head to head race or having a coin flip to determine the winner. (And who knows what would happen if they tied again) What is the rule for tiebreaks during the actual Olympic races? 

The BCS rankings are determined by averaging together two human polls and six computer rankings starting in the 8th week of the regular season. A team's ranking is determined by the following: Harris Poll - 1/3 of the ranking is determined by the Harris Poll which is a weekly poll of 115 invited sports media members who rank the top 25 of the 120 teams in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. In this poll the media assign each member of the top 25 a value from 1-25 with the top ranked team receiving the value 25. For this reason, the highest possible value that a team could receive (if voted #1 by all voters) would be 2875, so each team's overall score is divided by 2875 with the highest possible ranking being 1.00. Coaches Poll - 1/3 of the ranking is determined by the Coaches' Poll which is a weekly poll of 59 coaches in the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. It is important to note here that most coaches are unable to watch all the teams play each week and will typically have the Sports Information Director at the school create the rankings on their behalf. The same values are applied to each team here as in the Harris Poll, except the highest possible value is 1475 instead of 2875. Computer Rankings - 1/3 of the ranking is determined by the average of six computer rankings. The six computer rankings are Anderson & Hester, Richard Billingsley, Colley Matrix, Kenneth Massey, Jeff Sagarin and Peter Wolfe. Each computer ranking uses a different formula to rank the teams based on factors like wins, losses and strength of schedule with the highest possible score for a team being 1.00 just like in the human polls. The individual formulas used are largely unknown, but it should be noted that starting in 2004 the BCS prohibited the computer rankings from including margin of victory in their calculation. Since the formulas differ so much (some give more weight to the value of a conference win compared to a non-conference win, for example) the highest and lowest rankings received by the computers for a given team are not used to calculate this average. These three pieces are then averaged together to create the BCS rankings for the top 25 teams in the NCAA FBS and the teams are ranked in reverse order based on their average score. 

International Football Association Board (IFAB) is the body that determines the Laws of the Game of association football, FIFA Laws of the Game are determined and updated by the IFAB and it was last modified at the 126th Annual General Meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB) in England (Surrey) on 3 March 2012. These came into force on 1 June 2012. On FIFA Laws of the Game LAW 5 - The Referee under Injured players sections you can see full procedure when dealing with injured players, the main rules that relevant to your question are: 

Among the areas which gambling is legal are: Nevada(Las Vegas), Atlantic City, New Jersey or Tunica, Mississippi. I agree with you that "betting may give rise to match-fixing" but I see this as a reason to make gambling legal and supervised because let's face it gambling will occur anyway. It better to address the money to the country and community needs rather than today when in the money goes to private people or worse to fund terror, drugs and other illegal activities. Sources 1 2 

The answer to both of your first question is Australia 31–0 win over American Samoa - You can read about it on Wiki and even see highlits of the game over youtube There is some confusion about the score at the end of the match since the score board shows 32-0 but: 

From what I recall the most penalties in one international game I saw was 5 penalties on the 4th of July, 1999. It was on Argentina-Colombia match during Copa America. The amazing thing was that Martin Palermo missed 3 penalties in this game and Colombia won 3-0 (one of them was penalty). 4 missed penalties and another successful one. You can watch it here 

It is my assumption that the "waiver wire" that is referred to by Adam Schefter and other NFL writers is just their term for the communication that happens between NFL and the NFLPA, et al. Which is to say, the communication from the NFL that the player has been cut. So, if the Indianapolis Colts have already filed the appropriate paperwork with Peyton Manning and the appropriate league offices, the latest that he should be available to be contacted by other teams would be tomorrow at noon. 

This is definitely different for every sport, so I think it is hard to make a general statement. So, I will attempt to answer the question from the point-of-view of fantasy football and the NFL. There is evidence to show that it actually hurts ticket sales. In 2012, the NFL will require that teams show fantasy statistics at all stadiums. The belief is that fans are staying home to keep track of their fantasy football teams instead of buying tickets and attending games. Since ticket sales have been on the decline* for the past 5 years or so and subscriptions to services like NFL Red Zone and NFL Ticket are on the increase, it would stand to reason that the increase in popularity does not necessarily mean an increase in ticket sales. While this may be good for the NFL, it is not good for the individual clubs. It is worth noting that this impacts the NFL harder than other sports due to the fact that at least 50% of their games are played at 1:00PM ET on Sundays. So, if you are attending a game, you are likely missing out on the majority of other games going on that week. The impact may not be nearly as severe with fantasy baseball or fantasy basketball. *: warning- article is dated 2010, but the 2011 data was skewed due to the lockout and the 2012 data is not yet available 

But all of this are irrelevant to goalkeeper since there is and exception when the injured player is the goalkeeper: 

So according to this definitions the case you describe is in deed a "Closed Game" since you didn't left any open frames. the last 9-pins throw was part of the bonus shoot which isn't included in "Close Game" definition. Here is a very similar post that present the same question with a little bit different scenario. 

I agree with @SocioMatt that this question is a little vague, If you referring to the most people attended in a sport match so the answer is: Indianapolis Motor Speedway (motor racing venue) is the largest in the world with an capacity of 400,000 located at Speedway, Indiana, United States (although it has a seating capacity of 257,325 it has a infield seating that raises the capacity to an approximate 400,000) You can read about more sporting venues with a highest_attendance at the following source 

Winner - a shot hit by a player so the ball jumps more than once on the opponent side without the opponent being able to even touch the ball. Example Unforced error - a mistake made by the player from quite an easy shot hitted by from the opponent for example hitting the ball wrong, lack of precision or improper position. Number of unforced errors usually counted for statistics and indicate the level of each player's game. Example 

When we are talking about professional basketball this result isn't realistic. NBA: On November 22, 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons defeated the Minneapolis Lakers 19-18 in the lowest scoring game in NBA history. This was prior to shot clock being added in 1954/55. The lowest scoring NBA game since adding the shot-clock was in 1955, when Boston won Milwaukee 62:57 (119 points together). The lowest score by one team was in 1999 Chicago vs. Miami when Chicago scored only 49 points.
