I would talk about the technological ways that support can still be handled remotely. Our IT support is handled by people in another state. We communicate by phone and email and a formal ticketing system. If they need access to my computer, there are software packages that allow you to get control of someone else's computer in a network. All of our web programmers are located remotely from our users, some even in other countries. They use similar techniques. The main thing is to be aware that when you are remote, the burden of the extra steps to make sure communication is happening is on you. If you want to get permission, you need to show your boss how you intend to make sure communication is happening and how you intend to ensure that users can still get good customer service. The more strongly you show that you have a good plan in place, the more likely they are to be accommodating of your request. Further it might be to your advantage to work on this one bit at a time. You might have better luck asking for two days a week remote (until you move) so you can prove that users won't be negatively impacted. Since you are talking about moving to another state, your biggest argument is that you have valuable system knowledge that the company doesn't want to lose. I know we gained some of our first full-time remote workers this way. Their spouses moved and we found them too valuable to want to lose. We would not have given this opportunity to poor or even acceptable performers. So you will want to emphasize what you bring to the table that would be difficult to replace. Point out that you are moving in any event and that the risk to making you remote is low because they will lose you if they cannot accommodate. So they can let you work remote on a trial basis and if is doesn't work out, they are no worse off than if you had quit. 

Thi is a US-centric answer but I suspect many other countries operate the same way. In the end the taxes for the whole year should be the same. However, you may or may not end up having a refund from the government rather than getting all you want in the check. The reason why is that this separate check will be taxed a rate comparable to the rate for that amount not your ordinary rate. So if the change is large, you might have more than you need taken out. If the check is smallish, you might have less taken out and your eventual refund be lower or even owe money. They are probably issuing a spearate check because to combine it with your usual check would be to put you in a much higher tax bracket and that could cause you to get less money up front. Where this can be a real problem is if the amount you should have been paid was enough to push you to a higher tax bracket. If you didn't pay those taxes through the year, it is possible to have a nasty surprise when you file your taxes. Until you know, I would hold onto this cash. This is why you should always check your leave and earnings statments to make sure you are being paid what you should have been getting. The sooner a problem like this is found the less impact. If at all possible get them to issue the check before the end of the year. Crossing tax years on something like this can be a problem as well. 

Yes you are being irrational. That 3 times more is pretty standard, it goes to pay for things like office space, employees like HR that are not directly billable, electricity, insurance, employer contributions to benefits and profit. The company you work for gives annual raises like most companies. What you need to do now is to work to make sure you get one. 

Some employers will definitely not be happy with this and some will think that all good developers do such things. The trick is to weed out companies that do not have a compatible culture with what you intend to do anyway, so go ahead and inform them and recognize that you will be weeding out employers you don't want to work for anyway. I believe you are likely to find more compatible places in companies that are development shops as opposed to ones where development is a side effect of their main business. And large bureaucratic organizations may also (in my experience) be unlikely to want you to do this. 

It certainly is not unprofessional to shut the door. That is why offices have doors to begin with. Talk to your boss about the issue. Explain that 3 of 4 of you want the door closed but the other person vehemently does not. Get his permission to shut the door and then shut it. Allow him to deal with the person who doesn't like going with the majority in this case. A compromise might be to partially shut the door. That would keep some of the heat in but be more indicative that you want people to come in. 

This is going to depend on a lot of things in the company culture and what country you are in. Most companies I have worked for would be pretty unlikely to approve 3 weeks time off for anything less than a personal illness or family emergency. Some would, but only for people who were returning to a home country for a visit. I personally have never worked anywhere that it would be automatically approved. So your feeling that they may object could be true. In Europe they have longer vacations, so this might be an easier sell there than the US. What you need to do is look at the project schedule and determine when would be the best time for this and ask months ahead of time and, above all, do not buy any non-refundable tickets until you have approval. Depending on why you want to take this time off, it could help to tell them what your plans are (It could also hurt). But many places woudl be more likely to approve this for a one-time big event like a wedding and honeymoon than just for I want to sit around and do nothing for three weeks. Often the end of the year holiday season is a good time for a long vacation as things are slower then and I have seen people take vacation the last two weeks of the year and the first week of the new year in order to take vacation time from two different leave years. However, it is best to get your request in early for that time as others will be asking to use their leave in that time frame as well. If I were asking for that long at the holidays, my request would have gone in in February or so. Since there is only one other person on your team, check with him or her about leave plans. You don't want to be asking for the same week he is planning to get married for instance. Depending on what you are doing, consider if you can go somewhere and work remotely part of that time. I have known people who returned to their home country for a month and take two weeks leave and work remotely for 2 weeks. Of course if you are climbing Mt. Everest this might not be practical. But it is thought for an alternative if they don't want you gone that long. I have a former coworker who loves to take long trips and he generally works for two years, quits, takes a trip for a couple of months and then looks for another job. You have to be pretty good at managing money and pretty good at what you do and confident you can find a new job quickly to take this approach though. 

There will always be work left unfinished when you quit, it is not a reason to tell people you are thinking about quitting. It is NEVER in your own best interests to announce this before you are ready to actually quit. Sometimes a company responds to this by letting you go immediately, sometimes they start treating you like someone they can't trust or who they are no longer interested in helping. They will find a way to finish the project if it is that important to them. If you are concerned, simply make sure the project is well documented. 

I find your solution to be horrifyingly unethical. It will eventually result in a major bug going through because you distracted the CR team with your duck. If I had an employee that I found out was doing such a thing, he would be fired so fast his head would spin. Now granted you have a bad situation here. Basically you might as well not be doing code review. First step to fix it is to set out standards in writing that all must follow and then follow them. If the CR team objects to something done the way the standard describes, then point to that standard and move on and ignore that piece of input. If they are correct in something, add that to the standard. Next step is to define the CR process better. What is appropriate and what must you change vice what do you simply have to comment on and ignore. If the team and the CR disagree, then send the whole mess to management to adjudicate as part of your written process. As they see and feel the pain of the unnecessary comments and the time they have to spend dealing with them, then they might get more serious about getting this other team into line. The more management time is wasted with this, the more they will understand. Take the time to write up your justification for ignoring the change request including, the fact that the last time they wanted A, so this time you gave them pattern a and now that isn't good enough. Don;t worry about project delays in doing these write-ups. Management has agreed that delays are less important the CR even pointless CR at this point. You want to show them through their own experience of having to deal with the CR changes why that was the wrong choice. Remember the problem here is not the other team doing the CR. Then problem is incompetent management. Your best choice is to make this painful enough for management that they finally get off their butts and do something about it. Next can you find ways to assign other people to do the CR in the first place? This completely solves the problem. 

In general I favor not doing other tasks during meetings, if the meeting isn't important enough to you to pay attention, then you shouldn't be attending it. However in the case of a task that has been discussed or approved during the meeting, it is possible that you could delight someone by fixing it on the spot. For instance we have a client who is problematic at best. Often in a meeting, a discussion of some piece of data that got entered incorrectly (due to a bad client file or a data entry error on the part of the sales rep). Since they are located acoss the country, our meetings are teleconferences and I am at my desk. If I can fix something they bring up, I will make them happier. So when it is something really important (someone can't login for instance)that can be fixed in about 2 minutes or less, I will tell them that and excuse myself for that length of time while they discuss something that is not applicable to me (I can suggest they discuss X from the agenda). If the flow of the meeting would be disrupted by me excusing myself (and all agenda topics require my input), I wait until the meeting is done and then send out an email 5-10 minutes later showing the problem is fixed. Usually I tell them in the meeting that doing the fix won't take long and I will do it as soon as we are finished. This still delights them and isn't a rude indictment of my need not to pay attention. 

You need to adjust to your boss's conversational style not the other way around. He told you he knew there was an issue for later down the line. Let it rest, bring it up again later if he doesn't return to the subject. Also consider that some people are on the autism/Asperger's spectrum and they do not recognize the same social signals that others might or give them off. That means their communication style is different. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. There is no one right way to communicate. People in this spectrum tend to ignore what you call niceties as they see them as irrelevant. Different personality types also communicate differently. So do people of different genders and different cultural backgrounds. Stop thinking that what you want is the only right way to have a conversation. It is not your place to determine if you want to work on something or if something is going to to be useless. It is his. So go do the work and remind him that the other part needs to be put into place if he doesn't get back to you in a week or so or when you deliver the module he asked you to work on. If you feel he is not giving you enough information, then directly ask for the information you want rather than expecting him to read your mind. Your communication in the example above seemed relatively weak to me. Did you say to him that knowing how it would be used would affect the design? Did you tell him that you need a decision on this by x time to make sure that the final product will properly handle the eventual use? Did you make it clear to him that you think there are unresolved issues that will prevent you from working on this task? Are there in fact any issues that are preventing you from working on this now? Or is the information you want a "Nice to have" not a necessity? 

First be grateful they didn't reduce your pay. What to take from it is that you messed up but not so badly that you can't be put back into your previous level of trust. The key is to take responsibility for whatever happened and look for ways to change to ensure it doesn't happen again. The worst thing to do is to think, "it wasn't my fault and they are out to get me" and theerfore to whine about how bad things are. Your attitude speakes volumes here. It is possible to get demoted and be repromoted in the same organization. It just happened where I work in fact. It is also possible to move on and get promoted elsewhere. Your career isn't ruined and you have the chance to grow professionally from this.
