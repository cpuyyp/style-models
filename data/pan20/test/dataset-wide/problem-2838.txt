This does not allow people the freedom to say when rulers are making mistakes and so does not allow for error correction. It may be the case that liberal democracy could be replaced by some other system that would be better at correcting mistakes, but you won't find it in Plato. 

Your question is if people only live for a finite time why shouldn't they do bad stuff if they think they can get away with it? Morality is about how to make decisions. This covers everything that people usually think of as morality and more. For example, if we ask whether abortion is moral or not that's a question about how to make decisions about whether to get an abortion. People who oppose abortion would claim that a woman should always make a negative decision when considering whether to get an abortion. People who think abortion should be allowed would say that a woman should sometimes say yes when considering whether to get an abortion. Some philosophers say morality is about emotions, dispositions and that sort of thing, e.g. - morality is about whether you should care for one child more than another or whatever. All such issues are about how you should make decisions about emotional issues and so are included in saying that morality is about how to make decisions. Some philosophers may wish to limit the set of decisions under considerations to emotions or dispositions or whatever. This rips moral problems, including moral problems about emotions, out of context and makes it more difficult to solve them. This is a substantive and bad moral theory. The main question you ought to ask is whether the action benefits you. If the action doesn't benefit you that is a criticism of it. If there is a criticism of taking a particular action then it is a bad idea even if you don't know about the criticism. Stupidity will not stop adverse consequences of bad stuff you do, so thinking that you can do something immoral and "get away with it" will not save you. There are some bad actions you can take that only affect you. If your respond to a fault in your computer by getting angry and hitting the computer that is bad and stupid. You took a substantial risk of harming your computer, which was a bad idea. In addition, you have wasted time by getting angry rather than trying to think about how to solve your problem. There is no such thing as getting away with doing something stupid and bad like that. But let's suppose that you take an action that harms somebody else and you get away with it in the sense that at present the other person hasn't found out. If he does find out then he may be less willing to cooperate with you in future. You have no way of guaranteeing the other person won't find out. He might find out himself or somebody else might find out and tell him. You might inadvertently betray the secret yourself by slipping up. You have to keep track of how your deceived him and all the consequences of that or take a large risk of him finding out. Also whether he will find out depends not just on you and him but on everybody else that either of you deals with, so there is no way you can reasonably expect to succeed. Whether other people will find out will depend on what knowledge they have now, which you largely don't know. It also depends on what knowledge they will create in the future which you can't possibly know. Other people interact with you directly and indirectly so their future knowledge is influenced by your future knowledge. You can't predict what knowledge you will have in the future because if you could predict what you will know tomorrow you would already know it. Let's suppose that nobody finds out about the bad thing you did. Even leaving aside the cost of trying to cover up your misdeed, there is another problem. Your bad action was a result of bad ways of thinking about how to make decisions. By doing the bad thing and covering it up you have covered up your ignorance so that you haven't received feedback on how you could do better or fixed the problem yourself. To understand more about secular morality read "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch and Ayn Rand has written a lot of relevant stuff: "The Virtue of Selfishness", "The Fountainhead", "Atlas Shrugged", "Philosophy who needs it" and "The Voice of Reason". 

This would require an answer to the question of why people have rights and what sorts of other things should have right, if any. The reason people have rights is that having such standards makes it easier for people to do interesting stuff and to cooperate with one another, as I will now illustrate. So if we still had slavery then the people in the group who could be enslaved would have a hard time cooperating with anybody else because they might be enslaved at any time and be unable to follow through on their own plans. And people who wanted to cooperate with those in the enslaved group would have the problem that their partner could be enslaved and so would be unable to cooperate with them. The slavemasters would have the problem that if they are doing something stupid or bad their slaves can't leave which would indicate that he is doing something wrong. Embryos that don't have brains can't think and so can't offer improvements and shouldn't have rights. At some time between the development of the brain and when the child starts speaking, he starts creating knowledge (at a minimum the knowledge required to speak and acquire vocabulary). When the embryo crosses that line they should have rights and not before. Until they cross that line it is okay to take issue from them, after that line you should get their consent. My understanding is that embryos don't have the equipment required to create new knowledge until some time after 20 weeks or later. I doubt that any of the embryo tissue currently available comes from embryos that can come up with new ideas. 

Popper explains the role of values in science in "The World of Parmenides" Essay 2 Addendum 2. Popper points out that there are no authoritative sources of knowledge: everyone makes mistakes including scientists. Scientists should look out for their own mistakes, and the mistakes of others. They should should be grateful when mistakes are pointed out and should never cover up mistakes. the alternative to such conduct is to keep making the same mistakes repeatedly, which is not a good idea. One of the other answers sez stuff about the fact-value dichotomy: the idea that you can't derive moral ideas from facts. But Popper's epistemology sez you can't derive any theory from facts. Rather, all theories are created by proposing solutions to problems guesses and controlling them by criticism. So the fact that you can't derive moral theories from facts is irrelevant to their status since it doesn't distinguish moral knowledge from any other kind of knowledge. See "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, Chapter 5 for a discussion of this issue. 

Logic can't be justified. Nor can anything else. An argument sez that if some set of assumptions are true and certain rules are valid, then the conclusion is true. There is no known way to ensure that those conditions hold, and so there is no known way to prove the conclusion of an argument. In particular, no argument can do the work of justifying argument itself since the assumptions and rules would have to be shown to be true for the conclusion of that argument to be proven. The only known solution to this problem is to reject the demand for justification root and branch. All of our knowledge is just guesses controlled by criticism. For more on why justification is piffle and what should replace it, see "Realism and the Aim of Science" by Karl Popper Chapter I. 

Thomas Szasz has written about suicide and the policies currently in place for dealing with it (see "Fatal Freedom: The Ethics and Politics of Suicide" and "Suicide Prohibition: The Shame of Medicine"). There are institutional problems that get in the way of rational discussion of suicide. First, people who commit suicide are often labelled retrospectively as mentally ill. This is an implicit way of saying that they had no reason for committing suicide. Rather there was something wrong with the person's brain that made him commit suicide. This is a bizarre idea. It postulates the existence of a fault in your brain that has detailed about how to perform a difficult task - killing yourself. If we adopted this explanation in the case of Dario Iacoponi (the person in the story you linked) we would have to say that the disease somehow knew how to operate a shotgun. So in many cases where a person commits suicide his reasons for doing so are not discussed and criticised. Second, we have institutions dedicated to seeking out and punishing people who want to commit suicide. The punishment involves stuff like imprisoning a person in a mental hospital without trial and with no hope of release except with the consent of psychiatrists. A person who tries and fails to commit suicide or claims that he wants to commit suicide may also be ordered to take drugs and threatened with imprisonment if he doesn't. This threat may take the form of saying the person has to take the drugs or go back to the hospital. This only works if the person fears and hates being in the hospital and so it is a threat to impose something the person finds hateful and fearful. This is not an argument to explain to a person why he shouldn't commit suicide and so nobody could rationally decide not to commit suicide as a result of such treatment. And threatening a person who wants to commit suicide with incarceration and forced drugging may dissuade him from discussing suicide with anyone. This could result in him being less clear about suicide than he would be if he had to explain his position to somebody else. Third, a person can get certain drugs or accommodation if he lies about wanting to commit suicide. Some people who say they want to commit suicide may be lying to get drugs and housing. So a lot of stuff about why people attempt or commit suicide may be lies. Questioning such accounts is not considered acceptable because it might cast doubt on whether we should be providing such "services" with tax money and that would not be "compassionate". There may be reasons why a person should not commit suicide even though he currently wants to, e.g. - obligations to his children. The solution in such a case would be to help the person concerned change his preferences so that he no longer wants to kill himself. But if you're going to threaten people who want to commit suicide with incarceration and drugging and deny their moral agency, then it is almost impossible to rationally discuss the issue. As for Iacoponi he did not choose to share his reasons for killing himself with other people. It would be a step in the direction of rationality if people were more willing to respect his privacy. 

What I'm going to write here isn't a widely accepted position, but it has no unanswered criticisms. Mathematical knowledge, like all other knowledge, is not derived from anything. Any argument uses premises and rules of inference from which a conclusion supposedly follows - if the premises and rules are correct then so is the conclusion. But we have no way of guaranteeing the truth of premises or rules so arguments can't be used to prove conclusions. Maths isn't guaranteed to be complete and consistent for many reasons, including Godel's theorem. Another reason is that all our reasoning is conducted using physical systems, such as pen and paper and human brains. Those systems make errors, so mathematics can't be guaranteed to be error-free. Mathematical knowledge is created by guessing mathematical ideas as solutions to problems and criticising the guesses, not by deriving them from conclusions. The same is true for other knowledge. See the books by Popper listed here for more on the epistemology described above: $URL$ and "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch, especially chapter 10 which is specifically about maths. 

I think the situation your are presenting doesn't make sense. Let's take the military as an example. Being in some combat military units would involve taking substantial risks that you might die. The people who go into such units are aware of the risk and have chosen to take it. For any job that carries similar risk, the people doing it should know about the risk and choose to take it. So it is not the case that the people concerned necessarily want to live unconditionally. If the commanding officer of such a unit judges that some task carries a particularly high risk he has to judge who to assign to that task and will have some reason for whatever decision he takes. The person assigned to that task could argue he should not be assigned to it. It is impossible to specify all of the arguments that a person might give as to why he should not be assigned to a task. Such arguments would depend on lots of details of the context, not all of which are about the person or the task or even the unit itself. For example, a soldier might say he shouldn't be assigned to Task Certain Death because he has children and other people who can do it don't have children. I don't see that it makes any difference whether the person in question is made of meat, i.e. - a human as opposed to an AI. The solution to any realistic problem will depend on lots of stuff other than being made of meat. 

There are broadly two issues. The first is that our senses are accurate in some respects and correlated with the world in those respects. But our senses also have flaws as illustrated by optical illusions. In addition there is a lot of stuff that we don't sense except in an indirect way, e.g. - neutrinos and some kinds of electromagnetic radiation. So sense information has to be interpreted carefully to learn about how the world works. Nobody who understands how their senses work would trust them in the sense of uncritically assuming they are correct. The second issue is that many philosophers hold a theory according to which knowledge is justified true belief. Justification is an alleged process that shows that a particular idea is true or more probable than its competitors. In reality, you can't prove any position or show it is probable. Any argument requires premises and rules of inference and it doesn't prove (or make probable) those premises or rules of inference. If you're going to say they're self evident then you are acting in a dogmatic manner that will prevent you from spotting some mistakes. If you don't say they are self evident then you would have to prove those premises and rules of inference by another argument that would bring up a similar problem with respect to its premises and rules of inference. Sense information isn't derived from anything and so it is not justifiable As a result justificationists (those who believe in justification) who take their ideas seriously have to reject sense information as unjustified. In reality all knowledge is created by conjecture and criticism. You notice a problem with your current ideas, propose solutions, criticise the solutions until only one is left and then find a new problem. Experiments are useful only as criticism. Ideas can't be derived from experiment any more than from any other set of premises. Rather, the idea is that you work out how the consequences of one theory differ from those of another. Sense information can play a part in criticising proposals. If you sense something that is apparently incompatible with some theory you hold then you must add to your knowledge to account for that. You might scrap your old theory and come up with a new one, or you might find that your initial interpretation of what you sensed was wrong. Also, in general it's a bad idea to describe stuff in terms of what you sensed. It is better to say that some particular event apparently happened and then to draw conclusions about what a person would sense if there is a particular reason to do that. Saying that the event happened provides you with more ways to test whether you sensed what was going on correctly because the event will have implications other than what you happened to sense. For more on this issue you might want to read "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, Chapter 10.
