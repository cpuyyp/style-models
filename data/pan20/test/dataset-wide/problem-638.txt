I guess there are no dropper posts with shorter total length available? Seems like there is a need for one, especially with dual suspension bikes that have shorter seat tubes. You could drill out the top lug and thread of the bottle holder. Much easier to access this way then filing from inside. But you would be left with a slightly larger hole in your seat tube. 

Bicycles do have dynamo powered lights, which are pedal powered. They used to have a small generator that was rotated by the tyre. But this has been replaced by 'dynanmo hubs', with the generator being attached to the wheel hub. This basically means getting a wheel buildt around the hub or buying a wheel which has this type of hub, which would be fairly expensive. The one dynamo can power both front and back lights. Rear lights don't need to put out as much power as front ones. The batteries should last for several months of normal use in blink or flashing mode. For the front lights you may want to look at a better quality one that has several brightness settings. But you wont get much more than 6 hours burn time from them. Keeping a spare set of charged up batteries can help. 

Racing is all about speed. 25mm tyres have a larger contact area so there is more rolling resistance than a 23mm. It doesn't make a huge difference but it is significant. You wouldn't be competitive on 25s with everyone else runnings 23s. But for some very tough terrain, such as going over cobblestones, most teams will often run 25s front and back. They also deflate slightly from the maximum pressure to avoid some of the ride harshness. I started on 28mm tyres on a commuter and soon went down to 23mm. Didn't notice any difference in tyre wear or comfort. Bike was less effort to ride. Only downside is is that it is more likely to catch a rut in the road, but you ride with a bit more caution. 

Among the other good points mentioned, races at the elite/pro level (that aren't short track) are not won by solely through achieving the highest average speed. The difference is whether the competitor can produce the best power output, at the most opportune time. To make a vast generalisation, you ride at the same average speed as you competitors, except for a fraction of the race where you are a fraction of a percent faster, then you will win. This small increase in power output may not have much affect on the overall velocity. Team cycling strategy hinges on putting the strongest cyclist in the best position to make this exertion. For flat races, this means getting your sprinter to the front of the pelaton in the final few hundred meters. In mountain stages, getting your climber in position to let their superior muscle-to-weight ratio and efficiency win out. 

Most V-Brakes have a little screw at the base of each 'arm' that adjusts the pre-load. To move the brake pad closer to the rim, I believe that you need to loosen the screw. If that doesn't completely fix the problem, you might have to apply some oil to where the arm pivots. 

With the few problem tires that I've dealt with, I find that they always get easier to mount after successive changes due to the beads stretching. I haven't tried stretching a bead in advance before, but you might be able to do it by hooking the tire under your foot, pull upward, rotate tire, repeat. It only needs to stretch a bit before it will mount, so don't kill yourself. 

If you're riding in temperatures that are only a few degrees below zero, I wouldn't worry too much. As suggested elsewhere, make sure you keep a closer eye on maintenance (brushing off snow/ice, lubrication, etc). The colder it gets though, the greater the risk that drivetrain components will fail. I've had at least free hubs, where the pawls would stop engaging (i.e. no forward propulsion). I'd say that all your parts will be more brittle in such conditions, so take it easier on your bike than you would normally. Also, I've heard anecdotally that it's better to store your bike at sub-freezing temperatures if you ride regularly in the cold. The reasoning is that the snow and ice on your bike won't melt and find it's way into moving parts. This will be more important with the pivots on a dual suspension. 

I use a Garmin Forerunner 235 which has these features. The heart rate monitor is built into the back of the watch, rather than using a chest strap which I think the Polar model does. It can also connect to bike speed/cadence sensors, your smart phone etc. A dedicated bike computer like the Garmin Edge 810 is also useful as it adds a map display and route planning. 

Hard to be definitive. But I thought it started with Gary Fisher and others on cruiser bikes with coaster brakes $URL$ the Repack Races. He went on to develop the first mountain bikes. 

You will see sealed cartridge bearings in many bottom brackets, which use roller bearings. Also common in head sets. Ball bearings were more widley used up to around 10 years ago. But still common in pedals and hubs. 

I have an aluminium bike with a rubber dampener built into the handle bar, it's part of Specializeds range, not sure if there are general versions. A suspension fork would iron out more bumps than a carbon one, but may not fit your bike. I've taken videos from a handlebar mounted camera too and I think there will always be a lot of jolting that is impossible to dampen. Low light will make this worse. I think the best answer is to use a helmet mounted cam, so the suspension system is your body and neck. I've seen some fantastic videos of the New York alley cat races and they all use helmet cams. They also need strong necks! How much image stabilization can your camera provide? 

Most people go the other way. Many new bikes now only come with double chain rings. And compact crank sets give almost the same gear range as triples. But it should be possible. The distance the front derailleur travels is about the same. You may need to adjust your limit screws though. And of course you need to change the front shifter to a 3 speed version. 

Although I'm sure you could find a chrome-specific polish, you could try using polish for steel cookware (from the hardware store), baking soda and a damp cloth, or even tooth paste. If there are more stubborn specs of rust, try a mild solvent and something more abrasive. In this case, try to stay away from the clearer areas because you'll leave a lot of small scratches that would need to be polished out later. 

Folding versus wire refers to the material within the bead or 'edge' of each side of the tire. Foldable bead tires use kevlar in most cases (I think) and tires with each type are entirely compatible with the rim size that the tire is designed for (in the absence of a manufacturing defect). Folding bead tires have a few advantages (in my opinion): 

The main reason that I can think of is avoiding collisions with other riders, cars, pedestrians, etc. If someone tries to get your attention, it's still going to be harder to hear them. I'd say that if you want to listen to music, use only one earbud and keep the volume down. 

As others have stated, it depends on the season, but also on the type of bike you want. I have noticed that in Southern Ontario (Canada), the new models for mid-range and above bikes (say $800 CAD) can be discounted by September, if not sooner. Large bike manufacturers tend to announce their models for the next year by early fall, so retailers may be anxious to clear out old stock at that point. By year end, there will also be more consensus (sadly this information tends to be conflicting) on which models have quality or build problems (more frequent than you may expect). Speak to several riders you trust for feedback, but beware of of the 'zealous' who often try to impose their opinions ;-) Other times to look for deals are during local bike shows. Retailers are often present with stock they want to sell off, and you may find a good deal. In this case, since you may only have a few hours at the show to make your purchase, it's very important to do all of your research in advance. Find out: 

From $URL$ it looks like it could have been made form 1957 to 1961 or later. It looks like it has a 3 speed internal hub gearbox, probably a Sturmy Archer, as it is British made. Appears that Armstrong was part of a larger group by this stage, and the ealier design approach may have changed a lot. If you look under where the pedals are (the bottom bracket), there is often a serial number which may contain the year of manufacturer. Or it could be stamped elsewhere on the frame. 

The traditional 53/39 is basically what a pro would use, it's for speed as the top priority. Even some pros are using compact cranksets to help with climbing. 50/34 is the the normal next step down, but 46/30 just makes it easier again. Only drawback is that when shifting down to the small chain ring, the chain can come off. But a good derailleur should prevent this. 

If you are prepared to move down to the SRAM Apex model, you can still get a 50/34 172.5mm version $URL$ The first question and answer here indicates that an 11 spped chainring will work with a 10 speed chain: $URL$ 

Yes, at least one strand has broken. Looks like this happened where the cable was previously under the fastening bolt. Since then, the cable has been let out, maybe to allow for new brake pads? It would probably last a while before more strands break. But a new cable is only around $5. It's very important to be able to stop your bike reliably, so I would definitely replace it now. It's an easy change to make, cables ends normally slot in fairly easily to the brake levers on V-brakes. 

You can buy 30 meter rolls of cable housing such as $URL$ . I would opt for Shimano or Transfil, as have seen problems with the much cheaper Clarkes. Brake cable housings have a completely different construction to shifters. The housing is a coiled sheath , compared to the axial strands in shifter housing. And brake housing is larger diameter. So different housing for different purposes.
